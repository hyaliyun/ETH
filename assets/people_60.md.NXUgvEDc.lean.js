Eight aircraft from RAF West Raynham had been carrying out a 4x4 dogfight exercise at . Upon completion of the exercise the eight Hunters diverted to RAF Marham but due to bad weather six of the aircraft were lost including one fatality. Accident The eight Hunter F1s from the Day Fighter Leader Squadron of the Central Fighter Establishment departed RAF West Raynham, Norfolk, England at 10:50 to carry out the exercise at in the local area. Due to the expected bad weather later in the day the aircraft were scheduled to return to West Raynham overhead by 11:15. By 11:00 the weather at West Raynham had deteriorated with poor visibilityService Aviation Flight 17 February 1956 p201 and the aircraft were told to divert to nearby RAF Marham for a visual approach. The visibility suddenly reduced but due to the close proximity of the aircraft to each other it was not possible to complete ground controlled approaches. In the following confusion and with only 10 minutes of fuel remaining, only two aircraft landed successfully. ;WT629 :Descended to , but, unable to see the ground, he climbed away to and ejected with the aircraft crashing into a field northwest of Swaffham. ;WT639 :Descended to , but, unable to see the ground, he climbed away. The pilot ejected when the engine flamed out. The aircraft crashed into a forest southwest of Swaffham. ;WW633 :Descended to , but, unable to see the ground, he climbed away. The pilot ejected when the engine flamed out. The aircraft crashed into a field northwest of Swaffham. ;WW639 :Descended to , but, unable to see the ground, he climbed away. The pilot ejected when fuel was exhausted. The aircraft crashed south of Swaffham. ;WW635 :Crashed northwest of Swaffham, pilot killed. ;WW603 :Belly-landed following engine flame-out just east of the airfield, pilot unhurt. Aftermath Questions were asked in Parliament about the loss of six aircraft worth ¬£750,000 and the suspicion that the Mark 1 and 2 Hunters \\"are liable to be deficient in fuel if a crisis arises\\". Concern was also raised about the carrying out the exercise in the expected weather conditions. Investigation The Board of Inquiry reported that the primary cause of the accident was the sudden deterioration in the weather. The board also said it was an error of judgement to divert the aircraft to Marham on the assumption that they could do a visual landing. It decided that the decision to fly in the weather conditions was proper and reasonable, the pilots were all competent, the aircraft were serviceable and had adequate fuel and endurance for the planned mission. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Fighter Command decided that disciplinary action should be taken against officers in charge of flying operations at West Raynham. One officer was reproved and removed from his job and three other officers were reproved.

The scattered quanta have less energy than the quanta of the original ray. This discovery, known as the Compton effect or Compton scattering, demonstrates the particle concept of electromagnetic radiation. * 1922 ‚Äì Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach perform the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment, which detects discrete values of angular momentum for atoms in the ground state passing through an inhomogeneous magnetic field leading to the discovery of the spin of the electron. * 1922 ‚Äì Bohr updates his model of the atom to better explain the properties of the periodic table by assuming that certain numbers of electrons (for example 2, 8 and 18) corresponded to stable \\"closed shells\\", presaging orbital theory. * 1923 ‚Äì Pierre Auger discovers the Auger effect, where filling the inner-shell vacancy of an atom is accompanied by the emission of an electron from the same atom. * 1923 ‚Äì Louis de Broglie extends wave‚Äìparticle duality to particles, postulating that electrons in motion are associated with waves.

Later it is determined that this particle is actually the almost massless neutrino. * 1931 ‚Äì John Lennard-Jones proposes the Lennard-Jones interatomic potential * 1931 ‚Äì Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker find that if the very energetic alpha particles emitted from polonium fall on certain light elements, specifically beryllium, boron, or lithium, an unusually penetrating radiation is produced. At first this radiation is thought to be gamma radiation, although it is more penetrating than any gamma rays known, and the details of experimental results are very difficult to interpret on this basis. Some scientists begin to hypothesize the possible existence of another fundamental particle. * 1931 ‚Äì Erich H√ºckel redefines the property of aromaticity in a quantum mechanical context by introducing the 4n+2 rule, or H√ºckel's rule, which predicts whether an organic planar ring molecule will have aromatic properties. * 1931 ‚Äì Ernst Ruska creates the first electron microscope. * 1931 ‚Äì Ernest Lawrence creates the first cyclotron and founds the Radiation Laboratory, later the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; in 1939 he awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the cyclotron. * 1932 ‚Äì Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot show that if the unknown radiation generated by alpha particles falls on paraffin or any other hydrogen-containing compound, it ejects protons of very high energy. This is not in itself inconsistent with the proposed gamma ray nature of the new radiation, but detailed quantitative analysis of the data become increasingly difficult to reconcile with such a hypothesis. * 1932 ‚Äì James Chadwick performs a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis for the unknown radiation produced by alpha particles is untenable, and that the new particles must be the neutrons hypothesized by Fermi. * 1932 ‚Äì Werner Heisenberg applies perturbation theory to the two-electron problem to show how resonance arising from electron exchange can explain exchange forces. * 1932 ‚Äì Mark Oliphant: Building upon the nuclear transmutation experiments of Ernest Rutherford done a few years earlier, observes fusion of light nuclei (hydrogen isotopes).

Assuming that local realism is valid, they demonstrated that there would need to be hidden parameters to explain how measuring the quantum state of one particle could influence the quantum state of another particle without apparent contact between them. * 1935 - Schr√∂dinger develops the Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment. It illustrates what he saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics if subatomic particles can be in two contradictory quantum states at once. * 1935 ‚Äì Hideki Yukawa formulates his hypothesis of the Yukawa potential and predicts the existence of the pion, stating that such a potential arises from the exchange of a massive scalar field, as it would be found in the field of the pion. Prior to Yukawa's paper, it was believed that the scalar fields of the fundamental forces necessitated massless particles. * 1936 ‚Äì Alexandru Proca publishes prior to Hideki Yukawa his relativistic quantum field equations for a massive vector meson of spin-1 as a basis for nuclear forces. * 1936 ‚Äì Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann introduce Quantum Logic in an attempt to reconcile the apparent inconsistency of classical, Boolean logic with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of quantum mechanics as applied, for example, to the measurement of complementary (noncommuting) observables in quantum mechanics, such as position and momentum; current approaches to quantum logic involve noncommutative and non- associative many-valued logic. * 1936 ‚Äì Carl D. Anderson discovers muons while he is studying cosmic radiation. * 1937 ‚Äì Hermann Arthur Jahn and Edward Teller prove, using group theory, that non-linear degenerate molecules are unstable. The Jahn-Teller theorem essentially states that any non-linear molecule with a degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy, because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the complex. The latter process is called the Jahn-Teller effect; this effect was recently considered also in relation to the superconductivity mechanism in YBCO and other high temperature superconductors. The details of the Jahn-Teller effect are presented with several examples and EPR data in the basic textbook by Abragam and Bleaney (1970). * 1938 ‚Äì Charles Coulson makes the first accurate calculation of a molecular orbital wavefunction with the hydrogen molecule. * 1938 ‚Äì Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann send a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting they have detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons. Hahn calls this new phenomenon a 'bursting' of the uranium nucleus. Simultaneously, Hahn communicates these results to Lise Meitner. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpret these results as being a nuclear fission. Frisch confirms this experimentally on 13 January 1939. * 1939 ‚Äì Le√≥ Szil√°rd and Fermi discover neutron multiplication in uranium, proving that a chain reaction is indeed possible. 1940‚Äì1949 A Feynman diagram showing the radiation of a gluon when an electron and positron are annihilated. * 1942 ‚Äì Kan-Chang Wang first proposes the use of K-electron capture to experimentally detect neutrinos. * 1942 ‚Äì A team led by Enrico Fermi creates the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, called Chicago Pile-1, in a racquets court below the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago on December 2, 1942. * 1942 to 1946 ‚Äì J.

The estimated mass of the new particles is very rough, about half a proton's mass. More examples of these \\"V-particles\\" were slow in coming, and they are soon given the name kaons. * 1948 ‚Äì Sin- Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger Independently introduce perturbative renormalization as a method of correcting the original Lagrangian of a quantum field theory so as to eliminate a series of infinite terms that would otherwise result. * 1948 ‚Äì Richard Feynman states the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. * 1949 ‚Äì Freeman Dyson determines the equivalence of two formulations of quantum electrodynamics: Feynman's diagrammatic path integral formulation and the operator method developed by Julian Schwinger and Tomonaga.

A notable local politician in Kosovo and in Axis-occupied Albania, he took charge German-occupied Mitrovica and worked with the Germans to establish a pro-German Albanian government in Kosovo. Following the capitulation of Italy from the war, he helped form a provisional government under German occupation and set up the Second League of Prizren alongside other Albanian nationalists. On 5 November 1943, he was appointed Minister of the Interior of Albania and was effectively given direct command of the forces of the newly formed Albanian government. On 4 February 1944, police units subordinate to him massacred 86 residents of Tirana suspected of being anti-fascists. Deva was later involved in recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join the 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian). He lost his position as Minister of the Interior with the dissolution of the Albanian government on 16 June, and subsequently became leader of the Second League of Prizren and led anti-Partisan operations around Prizren in September. Soon after, he fled to Croatia and then to Austria with the help of the Germans, where he joined other anti-Communist Albanians. After the war, he moved via Italy to Damascus, where he helped publish an exile newspaper entitled Bashkimi i Kombit (). In 1956, he immigrated to the United States and briefly lived in New York and Boston before moving to Calaveras County, California in 1960. Here, he worked as an assistant supervisor at the mailing department of Stanford University in Palo Alto until his retirement in 1972. During this time, he led the Third League of Prizren and played an active role in organizing anti-Communist resistance until his death on 25 May 1978. Files released after his death showed that he had been recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) while living in the United States. Early life Xhafer Ibrahim Deva was born in Mitrovica, Kosovo Vilayet, Ottoman Empire on 21 February 1904. He was the seventh son of Ibrahim Deva, a wood merchant from ƒêakovica. Prior to the Balkan Wars, he attended a German-language school in Salonika. Afterwards, he studied commerce at Robert College, an American private boarding school in Istanbul's Arnavutk√∂y neighbourhood. He graduated in 1922 and travelled to Egypt, where he briefly worked for a bank in Alexandria. Suffering from rheumatism, he left Egypt and sought treatment in Austria. He studied forestry in Vienna before returning to Mitrovica in 1933 and setting up a lumber business that lasted until 1941. World War II The Kingdom of Italy invaded the Albanian Kingdom on 7 April 1939, and deposed its monarch, King Zog I. Afterwards, they re-established the Albanian state as a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy, By 1941, Deva was the first Kosovo Albanian political leader to declare himself ready to collaborate with the Germans in the event of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. Having been in contact with the Abwehr (the German military intelligence) for some time, he met Hermann Neubacher, the German special representative for southeastern Europe, in Belgrade prior to the invasion and had given the latter his support. The Axis powers invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Afterwards, the country was dismantled and the Wehrmacht established the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia under a military government of occupation. The territory included most of Serbia proper, with the addition of the northern portion of Kosovo and the Banat. Italian Albania was expanded to include adjacent parts of Yugoslavia incorporated mainly from the Yugoslav banovinas (regional subdivisions) of Vardar and Morava. Most of Kosovo was annexed to Albania and in the beginning Albanians living there enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation. Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians controlled the region and were encouraged to open Albanian language schools, which had been banned by the Yugoslav government. The Italians also gave the inhabitants Albanian citizenship and allowed them to fly the Albanian flag. Later that year, Deva worked with the Balli Komb√´tar and the Germans to establish a pro-German Albanian government in Kosovo linked to the Albanian nation. He quickly became the Balli Komb√´tar's most powerful figure, instructing members to follow a militant interpretation of Islam. The most capable Kosovo Albanian politician of the war, he was then appointed head of the local administration in German-occupied Mitrovica. After the capitulation of Italy, Deva and Bedri Pejani, assisted by the German emissary Franz von Schweiger, set up the Second League of Prizren on 16 September 1943. The league, whose aim was to defend the borders of Greater Albania, declared jihad (holy war) against Slavs, Gypsies and Jews and sought to create an ethnically cleansed Greater Albania. Between 4 and 7 December 1943, 400 soldiers of Kosovo Regiment commanded by Deva surrounded Peƒá and committed mass murder of local Serbs and Montenegrins, killing at least 300 people.: \\"At the end of 1943 (December 3), about 400 members of the so-called \\"Kosovo Regiment\\", headed by the criminal Xhafer Deva, arrived in Pec. As early as December 4, after the complete encirclement of the town, began the mass massacre of ...\\" Deva subsequently placed the newly established units of Balli Komb√´tar under the command of the Germans. Together with Pejani and Ibrahim Bi√ßak√ßiu, a landowner from Elbasan, he later helped create a national committee of twenty-two Albanian and Kosovo Albanian leaders which declared Albania independent and which elected an executive committee under Bi√ßak√ßiu to form a provisional government. On 5 November, Deva was appointed Minister of the Interior in the Tirana Government of Rexhep Mitrovica and collaborated with the Germans to oppose the spread of Communist forces in the north, effectively giving him direct command over the forces of the new government. Xhafer Deva's house in MitrovicaOn 4 February 1944, police units under his authority massacred 86 residents of Tirana suspected of being anti-fascists. Later, Deva began recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join the 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian). In May, he visited Germany with Ago Agaj, the Albanian Minister of National Economy. On 16 June, Mitrovica's government was dissolved and Deva lost his position as Minister of the Interior. He was then appointed leader of the Second League of Prizren, and took charge of anti-Partisan operations around the town in September. With the Allied victory in the Balkans imminent, Deva was also involved in a last-ditch attempt to set up an anti-Communist government in Kosovo, and received large caches of weapons and ammunition from SS General Josef Fitzthum and Neubacher's special representative, Karl Gstottenbauer. He and his men also engaged in collecting food and radio equipment from withdrawing German soldiers and attempted to purchase further weapons from them in order to organize a \\"final solution\\" of the Slavic population of Kosovo. Nothing came of this as the powerful Yugoslav Partisans prevented any large-scale ethnic cleansing of Slavs from occurring. According to German reports from November 1944, Deva had a force of about 20,000 armed men at his disposal. Historian Jozo Tomasevich writes that this number is likely exaggerated, but concedes that large groups of Kosovo Albanians were active in the region at the time. Historical review of Deva's role in World War II has become more complicated as, while his atrocities and collaboration with the Axis continue to be acknowledged and condemned, his role in saving Jews within Albania proper has also come to light. In the spring of 1944, the Nazi occupiers again asked for a list of Jews, which had earlier been refused by Albanian collaborationist authorities; upon hearing the grave situation, two of the local Jewish leaders sought the council of Mehdi Frasheri, a government official, for help; Frasheri referred them to Xhafer Deva, who apparently on the one hand had a \\"good reputation for protecting Jews\\" yet on the other \\"had become known for the terror he exercised across the streets of Tirana along with his hordes\\".Aleksandar Gaon (2005). \\"We Survived... Yugoslav Jews on the Holocaust\\". The Jewish Historical Museum. Page 278. Xhafer Deva, then the interior minister of the Albanian quisling government, reportedly told two Jewish delegates that he had the list, and agreed that he would protest the matter with the Germans. He refused to hand the list over to the Germans and rejected their requests to gather Jews in one place, purportedly because of the Albanian besa custom of hospitality. To the Germans, Deva argued that he would not hand over the list as he would not accept \\"interference in Albanian affairs\\". Deva informed the leaders of the Jewish community that he had successfully refused the German request afterward. In June 1944, the German government asked for the list of Jews again, and the Albanian collaborationist government refused yet again. Exile and death As the war in Albania drew to a close, Deva fled to Croatia and then to Austria in December, where he was resettled with the help of the Reich Foreign Ministry as the Germans evacuated Albania and Kosovo. There, he joined other anti-Communist Albanians in exile and took care of the ailing Rexhep Mitrovica. From late 1945 until early 1947, he lived in western Austria, at a safe distance from Soviet forces. In 1947, Deva moved via Italy to Damascus in Syria, where he helped publish an exile newspaper entitled Bashkimi i Kombit (). In 1956, he immigrated to the United States and briefly lived in New York and Boston. In 1960, he moved to Calaveras County, California, and worked as an assistant supervisor at the mailing department of Stanford University in Palo Alto until his retirement in 1972. In his years in exile, Deva led the Third League of Prizren and played an active role in organizing anti-Communist resistance. He died on 25 May 1978, aged 74. Files released after his death showed that Deva was one of 743 suspected fascist war criminals recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Cold War.

After success at the National Eisteddfod at a young age, he immigrated to the US, where he was educated. He is best known for composing Calvinist Methodist hymns. Biography Protheroe was born to Daniel and Eleanor Protheroe, and was instructed in music from a young age. He entered the National Eisteddfod in 1880 and 1881, before his voice broke, winning prizes in both festivals. At the age of 16 he conducted the Ystradgynlais Choir at the Llandeilo Eisteddfod, winning the choir prize. Aged 19, he immigrated to the US, settling in Scranton, Pennsylvania. There he took courses in music conducting, and was tutored by Parson Price, Dudley Buck and Hugo Karn. He graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree from Toronto College of Music, later becoming a Doctor of Music. Protheroe remained in Scranton until 1892, and for eight years was the conductor of the Cymmrodorion Choral Society. He moved to Milwaukee, conducting several choirs, before moving again, this time to Chicago. He continued conducting for various choirs, and taught at the Sherwood Music School.

He also played for the Queensland Sheffield Shield team for seven years, captaining them 11 times in his 25 appearances. Playing career In cricket, Levy was a prolific left-handed batsman who was a right-handed medium pace bowler; in baseball, he was a right-handed pitcher who also played shortstop. He played with the Waverley cricket and baseball clubs under coach and ex- international player Alan Kippax. Levyassisted Waverley to dominate the Sydney Baseball Premiership winning the competition from 1924 through to 1928 and represented New South Wales through these years. Through his success in baseball he became the first player to be offered a scholarship to play and study in the US. Although he declined this offer so he could continue his studies on insurance in Australia. In 1928, Levy's insurance company moved him to an office in Brisbane where he went to play his sport with Valley. He dominated the competition as a pitcher and the following year he played with Eastern Suburbs alongside Gunnah Mollah where they dominated the competition until Mollah switched to Valley in 1930 as to even up the competition. During his time playing baseball in Queensland, he got selected in the Queensland cricket team in 1929 and made his debut against Victoria scoring 129 and playing as a wicket-keeper. In 1932, Levy along with Roger Hartigan, persuaded Jack Hutcheon, president of Queensland Cricket, to call a meeting at Brisbane YMCA Hall for men interested in playing baseball and produced great interest among cricketers in the winter off-season. Levy was instrumental in the resurgence of baseball both in this era and after World War II. He was president of the organisation from 1936‚Äì1938 and was a player coach of the state team from 1933‚Äì1938 and again in 1954. Levy continued to have success over the next seven years of state cricket, including matches against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club averaging over 40 and was seriously considered for Australian selection, but was refused to travel inter-state with the Queensland team by his insurance company, effectively preventing him from participating in the 1939 Claxton Shield, the first Queensland participated in. After retiring from professional cricket, he went on to coach Queensland in interstate games, as well as a friendly series against the Tokyo Giants in 1954.

As a consequence, an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early 1980s. This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s. Following the murders of Pim Fortuyn (in 2002) and Theo van Gogh (in 2004) the political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands reached new heights. Lord Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, distinguishes between tolerance and multiculturalism, and says that the Netherlands is a tolerant, rather than multicultural, society.  Government policy  After the Second World War, an immigration took place of guest workers and migrants from the former colonies. There was low pressure to culturally assimilate, it was easy to gain citizenship and government agencies translated documents and services for immigrants who lacked Dutch language skills. Until the 1970s it was generally assumed that immigrants, especially guest workers, would eventually return to their countries of origin. Multiculturalism was adopted as a government policy by the Netherlands in the early 1980s, largely from a conviction that a quick assimilation of Muslim immigrants was impossible, and to stimulate remigration. In 1983 an \\"Ethnic Minorities Policy\\" was adopted. The Second Oil Crisis led to a collapse of Dutch industrial labour and caused massive unemployment for the former \\"guest workers\\", who were not easily integrated into the newly developing postindustrial society. Dutch low-skilled labour as a fraction of the total workforce declined from 18% to 2% between 1979 and 1985, disproportionally affecting immigrants.Niesing, W. 1993, The labor market position of ethnic minorities in the Netherlands, Dissertation Erasmus University Rotterdam, p. 21 State programs to rectify the situation were ineffective during the 1980s. The economic boom of the 1990s improved the situation. The unemployment rate of Moroccans, the most disadvantaged large immigrant group, declined from 50% to 10% between 1989 and 2001.Jonkers, A.P, 2003, Diskwalificatie van wetgeving: de totstandkoming en uitvoering van de Wet bevordering evenredige arbeidsdeelname allochtonen (Wbeaa). Dissertation Radboud Universiteit, p. 255 In the post-1998 period government policies have become stricter and while previous integration policies furthered diversity, diversity now was perceived to obstruct integration into Dutch society. The Netherlands has attracted international attention for the extent to which it reversed its previous multiculturalist policies, and its policies on cultural assimilation have been described as the toughest in Europe.Economist: Islam in Europe: Hostility at home; IHT: Dutch virtue of tolerance under strain; IHT: The Dutch redefine tolerance; Al-Ahram: How Holland lost its innocence ; PBS: A test of tolerance: Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands Immigration and opposition to it After the Second World War there were three successive waves of major immigration into the Netherlands. The first originated in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) in the 1940s and 1950s. The second wave originated in Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) and from Turkey and Morocco during the 1960s and 1970s, coinciding with a wave from the Dutch colony of Suriname. The second wave was largely in the form of labour migration of workers recruited by the Dutch state, a policy ended in 1974. The third wave consisted of asylum seekers from different countries such as Iran, Iraq, and former Yugoslavia since the mid-1990s. The waves should be discerned from a general high and rising 'background' level of labour immigration from European countries, that accounts for the majority of people settling in the Netherlands. The anti-immigration Centrumpartij had a limited electoral success since 1982, but its leader Hans Janmaat was ostracized, and fined for his discriminatory statements and promotion of ethnic cleansing.Weg met de Centrumpartij - Epiloog By 2007, nearly 20% of the country's population were either (western and non-western) immigrants or children of immigrant parents. Demand for unskilled labour The multicultural policy consensus down-played negative aspects of the presence of immigrant cultural communities, and stressed beneficial effects. Immigration was not subject to limits on cultural grounds: in practice, the immigration rate was determined by demand for unskilled labour, and later by migration of family members. The total Western and non-Western immigration and re-migration resulted in an immigrant population of about 3.5 million.CBS StatLine - Bevolking; kerncijfers naar diverse kenmerken In 2014, about two million inhabitants were non-Western immigrants (1,095,731) or the direct descendants of these. Net immigration and the initially higher birth rate of the immigrant communities, have transformed the Dutch population structure since the 1950s. In 2006 one fifth of the population was of non-Dutch ethnicity, about half of which were of non-Western origin. Immigration transformed Dutch cities especially: in Amsterdam, 55% of young people are of non-Western origin (mainly Moroccan, Surinamese and Turkish). Intellectual critique In 1999, the legal philosopher Paul Cliteur attacked multiculturalism in his book The Philosophy of Human Rights.Paul Cliteur. De filosofie van mensenrechten. Nijmegen 1999. Cliteur rejects all political correctness on the issue: Western culture, the Rechtsstaat (rule of law), and human rights are superior to non-Western culture and values. They are the product of the Enlightenment. Cliteur sees non-Western cultures not as merely different but as anachronistic. He sees multiculturalism primarily as an unacceptable ideology of cultural relativism, which would lead to acceptance of barbaric practices, including those brought to the Western World by immigrants. Cliteur lists infanticide, torture, slavery, oppression of women, homophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, gangs, female genital cutting, discrimination by immigrants, suttee, and the death penalty. Cliteur compares multiculturalism to the moral acceptance of Auschwitz, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot and the Ku Klux Klan. Cliteur's 1999 work is indicative of the polemic tone of the debate in the following years. Most of the \\"immigrant barbarities\\" which he names are regularly cited by opponents of multiculturalism, sometimes as a reductio ad absurdum, but also as supposed factual practices of immigrants in the Netherlands. In 2000, Paul Scheffer ‚Äî a member of the Labour Party and subsequently a professor of urban studies ‚Äî published his essay \\"The multicultural tragedy\\",Online at NRC, see . An English translation is available at an essay critical of both immigration and multiculturalism. Scheffer is a committed supporter of the nation-state, assuming that homogeneity and integration are necessary for a society: the presence of immigrants undermines this. A society does have a finite \\"absorptive capacity\\" for those from other cultures, he says, but this has been exceeded in the Netherlands. His position more specifically included the following points: *a huge influx of people from diverse cultural backgrounds, in combination with multiculturalism, resulted in spontaneous ethnic segregation. *the Netherlands must take its own language, culture, and history seriously, and immigrants must learn this language, culture, and history. *multiculturalism and immigration led to adaptation problems such as school drop-out, unemployment, and high crime rates. *a society which does not respect itself (its Dutch national identity) also has no value for immigrants *multicultural policy ignored Dutch language acquisition, which should be a priority in education. *Islam has not yet reformed itself, and does not accept the separation of church and state. *immigrants must always lose their own culture - that is the price of immigration, a \\"brutal bargain\\" (quote from Norman Podhoretz). Scheffer approvingly quoted the Dutch sociologist J.A.A. van Doorn as saying that the presence of immigrants in the Netherlands had \\"put the evolutionary clock back\\" by fifty years or more. The high immigration rate and the lack of integration threatened society, and must be stopped. His essay had a great impact, and led to what became known as the \\"integration debate\\". As in the essay, this was not simply about multiculturalism, but about immigration, Islam, the national identity, and national unity.Scheffer P., Immigrant Nations (Polity, 2011) ; English-language version of his 2007 book In 2002, the legal scholar Afshin Ellian, a refugee from Iran, advocated a monocultural Rechtsstaat in the Netherlands.Afshin Ellian. 'Leve de monoculturele Rechtsstaat' in NRC, 30 November 2002. A liberal democracy cannot be multicultural, he argued, because multiculturalism is an ideology and a democracy has no official ideology. What is more, according to Ellian, a democracy must be monolingual. The Dutch language is the language of the constitution, and therefore it must be the only public language ‚Äî all others must be limited to the private sphere. The Netherlands, he wrote, had been taken hostage by the left-wing multiculturalists, and their policy was in turn determined by the Islamic conservatives. Ellian stated that there were 800 000 Muslims in the country, with 450 mosques, and that the Netherlands had legalised the \\"feudal system of the Islamic Empire\\". Democracy and the rule of law could only be restored by abolishing multiculturalism. Political reaction Overturning the political stability of the 1990s, Fortuyn in early 2002 swiftly gained popularity.Opinion poll prediction He was assassinated during the 2002 Dutch national election campaign by a militant animal rights activist Volkert van der Graaf, who claimed in court to murdering Fortuyn to stop him exploiting Muslims as \\"scapegoats\\" and targeting \\"the weak parts of society to score points\\" in seeking political power. Fortuyn killed 'to protect Muslims' (The Telegraph) His supporters saw Fortuyn as a national martyr in the struggle against islamisation. Following Fortuyn's death, open rejection of multiculturalism and immigration ceased to be taboo. The new cabinet, under premier Jan-Peter Balkenende instituted a hard-line assimilation policy, enforced by fines and deportation, accompanied by far tighter controls on immigration and asylum. Many former supporters of multiculturalism shifted their position. In a 2006 manifesto \\"one country, one society\\",Een land, een samenleving several of them launched an appeal for a more cohesive society by \\"unity in diversity\\", while deploring what they saw as increasing intolerance. Piet Hein Donner, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations in the Rutte cabinet, said that \\"Dutch culture, norms and values must be dominant\\". Feminist opposition The most prominent figure in the post-Fortuyn debate of the issue was Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Her first criticisms of multiculturalism paralleled those of the early liberal-feminist critics in the United States ‚Äî the emphasis on group identity and group rights diminished individual liberty for those within the minorities, and especially for women. As time went on, her criticism was increasingly directed at Islam itself, and its incompatibility with democracy and Western culture. By 2004 she was the most prominent critic of Islam in Europe. She scripted a short film on Islamic oppression of women, featuring texts from the Quran on the naked bodies of women; its director Theo van Gogh was later assassinated by Mohammed Bouyeri. Threatened with death and heavily guarded, she spent most of her time in the United States, and moved to Washington in 2006 to work for the American Enterprise Institute. In 2006, she also expressed support for the Eurabia thesis ‚Äî that mainstream politicians are conspiring to fully Islamise Europe ‚Äî, and that its non-Muslim inhabitants will be reduced to dhimmitude.Confrontatie, geen verzoening in De Volkskrant, 8 April 2006. In a speech for CORE in January 2007, she declared that Western culture was overwhelmingly superior: > ... my dream is that those lucky enough to be born into a culture of \\"ladies > first\\" will let go of the myth that all cultures are equal. Human beings are > equal; cultures are not.American Enterprise Institute Ladies First', speech > by Ayaan Hirsi Ali to the Congress of Racial Equality. Patriotic measures Some of the measures, especially those seeking to promote patriotic identification, include: In the Netherlands, the naturalisation ceremony includes a gift symbolising national unity. In Gouda it is a candle in the national colours red-white-blue, in Amsterdam a Delftware potato with floral motifs.Nieuwe Amsterdammer krijgt Delfts blauw bij naturalisatie, De Volkskrant, 24 August 2006. There are proposed measures which go much further than these. They typically, but not always, come from firmly right-wing parties and their supporters. The proposals illustrate the \\"post-multicultural\\" climate: a loyalty oath for all citizens, legal prohibition of public use of a foreign language, cessation of all immigration, expulsion of criminal, unemployed or not integrated immigrants, withdrawal from the European Union, a compulsory (non-military) national service;Pim Fortuyn in 'De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars', see 'Politiek worstelt al jaren met lastige jongeren' a ban on the construction of mosques,. Also policy of the Party for the Netherlands of Hilbrand Nawijn closure of all Islamic schools,Policy of the Party for the Netherlands of Hilbrand Nawijn a closure of all mosques, or a complete ban on Islam. The Party for Freedom of anti- immigration politician Geert Wilders opposed the nomination of two ministers because they had dual nationality. The party subsequently proposed a motion of no confidence in both ministers. The party doubts their loyalty to the Netherlands, in cases of conflict with their countries of origin (Turkey and Morocco).Expatica: \\"Dual nationality fuss unnecessary\\", 23 February 2007. According to an opinion poll more than half the population agrees with the party.Trouw: \\"Helft Nederlanders oneens met dubbele nationaliteit.\\" Opinion is sharply divided by political party: 96% of Wilders' voters agree with him, and 93% of GreenLeft voters disagree. Likelihood of polarization Although such policies often have the stated aim of reviving national unity, one result has been an increased polarization.\\"All the recent evidence shows that we are, as a society, becoming more socially polarized by race and faith.\\" (Trevor Phillips). Guardian, October 23, 2006: Muslim veil debate could start riots, warns Phillips Muslims in Britain or the Netherlands hear that their culture is backward, that Western culture is superior, and that they are obliged to adopt it. In turn, defensive reactionsForeign Policy Centre.Born in the UK: Young Muslims in Britain'. include an increased self-identification as \\"Muslims\\", and adoption of Islamic dress by women and \\"Islamic\\" beards by men. Part of the Muslim minority is now hostile to the society they live in, and sympathetic to terrorism.Bin Laden is seen as a hero, BBC In Amsterdam's secondary schools, about half of the Moroccan minority does not identify with the Netherlands: they see their identity as \\"Muslim\\", and regularly express anti-Western views.City of Amsterdam policy document, February 2006. Wij Amsterdammers II: investeren in mensen en grenzen. New terms for minorities New terms for minorities of immigrant descent have come into use: the term allochtoon in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium) and the Netherlands. Both are applied regardless of citizenship. The renewed emphasis on historical culture places higher demands on cultural assimilation; immigrants may be encouraged to learn, for example, to identify and describe cultural heroes and historical figures such as Thorbecke and William of Orange.Both came second, in polls to find the Greatest Briton and the Greatest Netherlander.

It is the burial place of low status individuals from the ancient city of Akhetaten. The site is located close to the Southern Tombs of the Nobles. Archaeological excavation was undertaken by the Egypt Exploration Society between 2006 and 2013. Discovery This cemetery was discovered in 2003 during GPS surveying of the desert by the Egypt Exploration Society. It is situated on the east side of a narrow wadi that runs southward and to the east behind Southern Tomb 25 (Ay). It appears to have been thoroughly robbed and partially washed away by floods, leaving a scatter of human bone on the floor of the valley and across the plain. It was the subject of a systematic survey in 2005. Investigation and findings Excavation commenced in 2006 and concluded in 2013. 381 graves were excavated across the four main areas - wadi mouth, lower, upper, and wadi end - with the aim of recovering 400 individuals. Extrapolations from this data estimate the cemetery contains 6000 individuals. The burials of men, women, children, and infants occur in the proportions expected for the time period, with high levels of infant and childhood mortality. The deceased were interred wrapped in fabric or matting, and placed in coffins made of tamarisk stems, palm mid-rib, or more rarely a coffin made of wood, pottery, or mud. In one instance a wooden coffin was found inside a mud-brick vault. No evidence of artificial mummification was found, although the body could be wrapped in linen strips. Grave goods as a whole are uncommon; when present they consist most frequently of pottery vessels, sometimes containing food offerings - in one instance pomegranates were found interred with a baby. Other grave goods found include kohl tubes and applicators, bronze tweezers, a mirror wrapped in fabric, a model oar, and an adze. Amulets or other items of jewelry are rare but when they do occur take the form of protective deities such as Taweret, necklaces of faience beads, scarabs, including ones inscribed for Thutmose III or Amenhotep III, copper toe rings, or more unusually, a gold bracelet on the wrist of a baby. The graves were covered by a cairn of stones, now mostly destroyed, and some were topped with a grave marker; the occasional scatter of mud brick may indicate some tombs had a brick superstructure. Two limestone pyramidions were recovered, along with 15 stelae which mostly had a pointed, triangular shape. Those with a carved scene show the deceased receiving offerings; the more common type features a rectangular depression where a scene, of which no trace remains, would be painted or inserted. Layout The layout of the cemetery appears organic, and reflects what is most likely family-level organisation of plots. Despite areas of crowding, the graves never encroach on each other. All are well cut, with vertical walls, and closely match the size and shape of the coffin, indicating that, while the grave was likely not pre-cut, it was the work of professionals and not of the family. Decorated coffins 40 wooden coffins were uncovered, accounting for about 10% of burials at South Tombs Cemetery. Half of these were simple undecorated boxes; the remaining 20 coffins had surviving painted decoration. Of these, only eight were complete enough for their decorative scheme to be studied. The simplest decoration belonged to a child's box-shaped coffin. It consists of yellow text bands framed by black lines; no text or images were added. The seven remaining decorated coffins appear to be anthropoid though many are in a fragile condition due to the disintegration of the wood, either through rotting or by termites. The colour scheme is black-based, with yellow bands imitating the straps seen on mummy wrappings. The decorative themes can be divided into two types: those that preserve the pre-Amarna Osiride decoration, and a new 'godless' type, not attested outside Amarna, featuring offering bearers in place of the usual funerary gods. Three coffins of each decoration type were found; one was undetermined. The text found on this new type features prayers for offerings and other benefits, rather than the traditional recitations derived from Chapter 151 of the Book of the Dead. However, even where they are well preserved, the inscriptions are not always legible. The text preserved on one coffin contains recognisable groups of hieroglyphs but they do not form coherent sentences, suggesting that although written with a practiced hand, the writer was not literate. Names are present on coffins with legible inscriptions. One is a woman named Maia, who died at 40-45 years old. Her disturbed remains were found inside a badly termite-eaten coffin made of sycamore fig, tamarisk, and Mimusops sp. wood. Horizontal bands give short prayers and she asks to receive offerings; the side panels preserve mourning figures. There is no sign or mention of the Aten or royal family. Another coffin of the same godless type bears the names Hesy(t)en-Ra and Hesy(t)en- Aten. The name Tiy is preserved on a coffin with traditional decoration; inside was the partial skeleton of a woman aged 40-45 years. Hairstyles Though the human remains were usually entirely skeletonised, desiccated skin and preserved hair was encountered. A variety of hairstyles were found preserved on skulls, with some in more brittle condition than others. The hair types range from very curly black hair to straight brown hair, probably indicating ethnic variation. Hair was generally parted in the centre. The styles consisted of three-strand braids approximately 1-2 centimetres wide and commonly not more than long; in one instance the braids were long. Fat was used to secure the hairstyles and no pins or other means of fastening were found. Coils or ringlets were found around the ears, otherwise there is no clear pattern to the hairstyles. Hair extensions were used, often braided into very short hair (10 centimetres long) and the joins were covered by the individual's own hair. One very complex hairstyle consisted of 70 extensions placed in differed layers on the head. Generally, more extensions were found in brown hair than in black hair. The colours of extensions varied from grey to dark black on one individual which suggests hair had been obtained from many different donors. The grey hair of one woman was dyed orange-red, probably with henna. Evidence of a sidelock of youth of fine braids 8-10 centimetres long was found on at least three children but was most clear on two: on the left side of the head on one child, and on the back right side of other. Loose hair was found on the top of the heads. Head cone A significant find from the South Tombs Cemetery was the first extant 'incense cone' on the head of an adult woman in an undisturbed grave. Another cone was excavated from the North Tombs Cemetery. The cone was originally a low dome; it is hollow, now brittle, and has a silky feel. Chemical analysis has revealed they are composed of natural wax. No evidence of any perfume was found, although it may have evaporated over time. The hollow shell may have been filled with a soft perfume, or have been made intentionally hollow for burial. The cones may have been shaped around, or filled with, a textile, as impressions of fabric are present on the inner surface. The purpose of the cones is not known for certain. They may have served to purify the deceased, or were perhaps associated with rebirth - the princess Meketaten is depicted wearing such a cone while she is mourned by her family. There were likely other incense cones present at the South Tombs Cemetery, as smaller fragments were found, or their presence may be indicated by the discolouration of hair or bone. In some instances, a fabric covering was present on the head, indicating the cone may have been wrapped separately. There is also evidence of braids being styled into a platform, possibly to support a cone. Health Analysis of the skeletal remains revealed that those who lived and died at Amarna lived short, hard lives. 26.1% of examined individuals died before the age of seven. Mortality increased throughout childhood and early adulthood, peaking between the ages of 15-25, when it would normally be expected to be lowest. Nutritional deficiencies were common, with 36.4% of subadults and 12.7% of adults exhibiting cribra orbitalia; there is also some evidence of scurvy. Analysis of microwear on the teeth of these individuals indicates a diet that was made up primarily of grain. The lack of butchered animal remains from the city suggests meat was not commonly eaten by the general populace. Almost half of the adults examined have evidence of osteophytes and two-thirds of adults have some form of trauma, usually related to the spine, such as compression fractures of the vertebrae, Schmorl's nodes, and spondylosis. Such injuries are thought to be the result of carrying heavy loads such as water from wells, or talatat blocks for the construction of the city. Fractures of arms or legs are less common and probably represent accidents; only four individuals show evidence of wounds caused by weapons. One of these individuals is thought to have been a solider, based on his multiple traumatic injuries that include a fractured sternum, healed and healing rib fractures, a \\"parry\\" fracture to the left arm, and two stab wounds to the pelvis, the first of which healed, the second became infected and likely contributed to his death. He also had a different diet with better nutrition than others buried at Amarna as he does not show signs of cribra orbitalia, and has extensive dental caries and abscesses. As a result of chronic physical stresses and poor diets, Amarna adults are, on average, the shortest in all of ancient Egypt. Cranio-morphological study of the skeletal remains reveals a highly diverse population, likely originating from across Egypt, and including people of foreign descent. Plague has been suggested as the cause of the high mortality in young adults. Amarna letters EA 11, 35, 96, and 932 mention plague both within Egypt and in neighbouring countries, while the Plague Prayers of Mursili II mention plague breaking out among Egyptian prisoners of war captured in the aftermath of the Zannanza affair, in the reign of his father Suppiluliuma I.

The MET call is a hospital based system, designed for a nurse (or other staff member) to alert and call other staff for help when a patients vital signs have fallen outside set criteria. These criteria were designed around studies suggesting that certain vital sign ranges and symptoms occur before poor patient conditions which may lead to death (For example, Chest pain, a raise in heart rate and an elevated blood pressure may indicate the patient may be about to have a heart attack). In the original model, the criteria also include \\"and any patient you are seriously worried about\\", although this is not included in all hospitals despite some observational trials showing it is the most commonly used calling criteria in hospitals that use it. MET calls may be triggered using vitals sign charts where patient observations breach certain parameters that represent severe deterioration. Triggers may relate to single parameter breaches (such as an extremely low blood pressure or a very fast heart rate), or from a combination of less severe abnormal vital signs that are cumulatively scored to identify a patient at high risk. Such systems are called MEWS or modified early warning score systems. Vital sign charts are often color-coded to aid both the calculation of MEWS and those patient that need a MET call.http://www.wellingtonicu.com/AboutUs/Services/EWS/ The MET call is generally made by a phone call (e.g. to \\"switch\\"). On the ward it may be via an emergency button on the wall, which sounds a siren, and in some hospitals, a red light will begin flashing outside the patient‚Äôs room. Most staff are encouraged to attend and help as required. Interventions and tests that the MET call may include: Oxygen (via a mask), Blood glucose levels, CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure), X-ray, ECG, Vital signs, documentation and Spirometry. Two to three trained professionals arrive at the room of the Emergency, and will work together with staff to assist the patient, as well as doctors, nurses and anyone who is able to help. Jobs are allocated including someone to record the nature of emergency and what they are doing to fix the problem. Some patients may be transferred to ICU post MET. Implementation of the MET system has been controversial. It generally requires ICU medical and nursing staff to move beyond their traditional boundaries of control. It implies extra work, although arguably reduces the workload of patients arriving in ICU. Studies such as the MERIT study have been inconclusive and a source of ongoing controversy. Apart from clinical care implications, the MET system represents a political change within the hospital hierarchy, as it empowers nurses on the ward to summon help from senior critical care medical staff, rather than the traditional route of moving up the medical hierarchy starting with the intern. This political dimension of the MET system is not commonly discussed in scientific literature, and is probably not recognised by most hospital staff, but may underlie much of the resistance to this intuitively appropriate system. Many institutions however already have 'Cardiac Arrest' or 'Code Blue' teams that are often activated by nursing staff. Utilising such a system earlier where rapid expert intervention may prevent continued decline culminating in arrest may be one way in which the team can be sold to a resistant medical hierarchy.

Name Six Mile Run derives its name (along with other area streams including Mile Run, Three Mile Run, Nine Mile Run, and Ten Mile Run) from the distance early surveyors estimated it was from the point where the historic King's Highway (now Rt. 27) left the Raritan River at New Brunswick to the point the roadway crossed the stream. The estimates were not very accurate but the stream names have remained in use ever since. Course Six Mile Run starts near Corporate Road in North Brunswick . It crosses Cozzens Lane, then flows through a residential development. It joins up with the drainage from a lake then crosses Rt. 27. It then joins with the Nine Mile Run, a major tributary, and crosses South Middlebush Rd. It then crosses Canal Road and drains into the Millstone River . Accessibility Six Mile Run is easily accessible in several places, including Cozzens Lane and the residential development. It also can be accessed at Route 27, South Middlebush Road, and Canal Road, as well as the D&R; Canal Trail. It can be also accessed by trails in the Six Mile Run Reservoir Site. Terrain Six Mile Run is generally between rocky and muddy terrain. Near Cozzens Lane, the streambed is rocky with a muddy covering. It is quite deep in many places. Farther downstream in the residential development, the stream becomes more rocky and fast flowing. It then becomes rocky and deep near Route 27, and remains like that for most of its downstream course. It widens considerably when it joins the Nine Mile Run. Near its mouth, it has a mixture of pebbles and sand for its streambed. Many large fish are found in the deep pools near the Delaware and Raritan Canal.

It produces and loans out audio books and braille books. Its services are aimed at people who have difficulty reading printed texts, for example because of dyslexia, visual impairment or other disabilities which making reading difficult. The library serves users across the whole country and the service is free of charge. Audiobooks are sent free by post on CD and can also be downloaded or streamed from the library's website. Users can also use the library's Lydh√∏r app to listen to audiobooks on smartphones or tablets. The library is Norway's largest producers of audiobooks and braille books. In 2014, its collection was made up of 18000 audiobooks and 7400 braille books. The library also produces and loans out study materials for students with difficulties reading printed texts. Norwegian law permits the library to produce audio books and braille books from material subject to copyright. The library has about 29000 users. History The Norwegian Association of the Blind (\\"Norges Blindeforbund\\") established the country's first braille library in Bergen in 1910. Further branches were opened in Oslo (1913) and Trondheim (1916). The Association owned and ran the libraries until 1989, when responsibility for supplying library services to those with visual impairment and reading difficulties was transferred to the state in the form of the Ministry of Culture. The library's offices in Bergen and Trondheim were closed in 2007. All production and loaning activities now take place from the library's premises in Oslo. Organisation The library had 55 employees in 2014. A further 40 people are employed as narrators. √òyvind Engh is the library's director. Members of the library's board, currently headed by Trygve Nordby, are appointed by the Department of Culture. Library Services The library is both a public library and an academic library. Registered users have access to the entire collection. The collections holds both works of fiction and non-fiction aimed at adults, young people and children. It also holds magazines and newspapers. People with visual impairment are entitled to have works they require produced. Students with dyslexia or other reading difficulties may borrow audiobooks which have already been produced by the library or other libraries in other countries which the library cooperates with. Users can search for materials on the library's website, from where registered users can either download or stream content. They can also listen to content using the library's Lydh√∏r app. The library provides services to anyone who can document that they have difficulties reading printed text. To register with the library, users have to provide a document signed by a competent person (for example a doctor, teacher, nurse, logopedist) which confirms that the user needs access to the library's materials. Users already registered as blind or partially sighted with the Norwegian Association of the Blind do not have to provide such a document. Schools with schoolchildren who have reading difficulties may also borrow materials, as do institions with users who have reading difficulties. Such schools or institions are registered as users through a contact person. Audiobooks Audiobooks produced by the library are recorded by professional narrators at the library's studios. The library also purchases audiobooks produced by commercial publishers. The books are transferred to DAISY format before being loaned out. DAISY is a digital format which makes it possible to navigate through an audiobook in a similar fashion to a printed book. To be able to use all the features of a DAISY book, users are recommended to use a DAISY player or to use the EasyReader Express PC software which is on all the library's audiobooks. The audio files of DAISY books are in mp3 format. The books can also be listened to any MP3 player, but with reduced navigation capabilities. Users with visual impairment can borrow DAISY players from the Norwegian county administration where they live. In 2008, the state and copyright holders signed a new audiobook agreement. The agreement allows the library to lend an unlimited number of copies of materials produced by the library itself, so that there are never waiting lists for such materials. Speech synthesis An increasing number of books are produced using speech synthesis. Around 80% of study materials and most audio editions of magazines and newspapers are produced using speech synthesis. Audiobooks produced using speech synthesis are also available as full text books, which means they can be read on a PC at the same time as being listened to. The library launched speech synthesis software called Brage in 2009. The software was developed with the equivalent library in Sweden and builds on the resources of Norway's Spr√•kbank, a collection of digitized language resources. Partners The library cooperates with special interest groups and others who are in contact with the library's users. DAISY Consortium and the Norwegian DAISY consortium The library is represented on the board of DAISY Consortium (DC), which is of significant importance to the library's work. In 2006 the library initiated the setting up of the Norwegian DAISY consortium (\\"Norsk DAISY-konsortium\\", often referred to as simply \\"NDK\\"). The Norwegian DAISY consortium is a member of the international DC and is made up of various Norwegian organisations dealing with sight impairment such as Norwegian State Special Pedialogical Services, The Norwegian Association of the Blind and the library itself. International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) The library is a member of the Standing Committee of the IFLA section called Libraries Services Persons with Print Disabilities. The section's main work involves ensuring that people with sight impairment and reading difficulties get the same access to library services as others. The library is also a participant in the TIGAR project, in which the IFLA section works with the DAISY Consortium. The project aims to ensure that those with sight impairment or reading difficulties have access to the literature they desire in digital form, regardless of where they are in the world. International cooperation agreements and file exchanges are to ensure the access. Nordic cooperation The library cooperates with similar libraries in the Nordic region: Nota in Denmark, MTM in Sweden, Hlj√≥√∞b√≥kasafn √çslands in Iceland and Celia in Finland. In the autumn of 2009 the libraries signed an agreement to exchange their materials across borders.

It is a brick Federal style building from the 1830s, one of the few remaining examples in New York of a commercial building in that style from that period. Of the two extant works in New York of Rochester architect-builder Hezekiah Eldredge, it is the less restrained, serving as a bank and a residence for the cashier. The Batavia Club purchased the building in 1886 and used it for many years. In 1973, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After the club moved out in 2000, it became the Seymour Place facility of GO ART!, the Genesee-Orleans Regional Arts Council. Building The building is on the intersection's northeast corner. On the other corners are more modern commercial buildings, as on both sides of East Main. To the northwest is the Genesee Country Mall's large parking area. Two blocks to the west is Batavia's city hall and the Genesee County Courthouse Historic District, the collection of government buildings at downtown's western edge. The former clubhouse is an L-shaped two-story three- by-five-bay brick building on a stone foundation with stepped gable roof. Two chimneys rise at the east and west ends. A one-story cement block kitchen addition is built on the north (rear) of the main section, replacing an earlier kitchen wing. The rear has two sections, the three-bay west elevation of the main block and a two-bay rear projection. All windows have plain stone sills and lintels. On the south (front) facade, they are additionally flanked by paired wooden colonettes. The main entrance, with sidelights, is similarly decorated and topped with a heavy wooden bracketed flat-roofed hood. The small front yard has a wooden fence with wide square recessed-paneled columns. At the front, and on the rear extension, the roofline is marked by overhanging eaves with a dentilled soffit. On the side elevations a parapet with the chimneys rises above the roofline. The six-over-six double-hung sash windows have just the sill and lintel. Above them, in the gable field, is a wide fanlight and \\"SEYMOUR PLACE\\" in metal lettering on the west side. The main block's northern window has been converted into an entrance with four-paned glass transom. Stairs and a wheelchair ramp lead to it from the north. Inside, the central hallway divides a living room, formerly the banking room and now an art gallery, on the west from a dining room (also used as a gallery on occasion) with two fireplaces running the length of the building to the east. The woodwork, such as the stairs and mantels, is original and well-maintained. In the rear are the kitchen facilities, with some past fire damage evident, a bar and storage space. The upstairs rooms are plainer. Largely unused during the club's ownership, they are today office space for the arts council.Genesee-Orleans Regional Arts Council, , 2‚Äì3, retrieved December 25, 2010. History alt=A view of the front of the Batavia Club building. In the early 19th century, Batavia was the headquarters of the Holland Land Company, owners of the Holland Purchase that became Western New York. As the region's largest settlement at the time, it was an ideal place for a bank, and thus the Bank of Genesee was established in the city in 1829. For a year it operated from the local mansion of its first president. The new bank bought the location of the current building in 1830. Hezekiah Eldredge and his partner, Joshua Driscoll of Lockport, were commissioned to design a building. They had designed banks in Driscoll's hometown as well as Buffalo, where one of the bank's directors was also on the board of the Genesee and may have helped them get the assignment. It was to be home to the bank's cashier as well. Six thousand dollars ($ in contemporary dollars) was budgeted for construction. After going well in excess of that budget, Driscoll and Eldredge's building was finished the following year. The high cost may have been the result of paying some of the region's best craftsmen high hourly wages to produce a building far less restrained than the Lockport Bank building, the only other work of Eldredge's that remains in the region (now a contributing property to the Lowertown Historic District). The bank sold the building to the club in 1886, four years after it was organized. It made such alterations as were necessary for the purposes of using the building as the headquarters of a fraternal organization. The most significant was moving the main entrance to the south facade, facing Main Street. In 1966, a fire damaged the original kitchen wing, and the current cement-block wing was built as a replacement. Urban renewal in the 1970s demolished the surrounding buildings, leaving the club as the only remaining 19th century building in the neighborhood. In 2000 the club closed down, leaving the building vacant. GO ART!, the Genesee- Orleans Regional Arts Council, moved in two years later. In 2008, the group received a grant from the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to renovate and restore the building. Upon the completion of work in 2010, it was renamed Seymour Place in memory of a local couple, longtime benefactors of the center, who had contributed much of the matching funds to make the $320,000 project possible. Work done at that time exposed the basement's original dirt floors, as well as a safe on rollers the center has not been able to open. GO ART! uses the building for art exhibits and performances, and makes the space available to community groups for meetings. It is also rented for events such as wedding receptions and showers.

Davies (6 January 1881 ‚Äì 21 April 1965) and Norman de Garis Davies (1865‚Äì5 November 1941) were a married couple of illustrators and copyists who worked in the early and mid-twentieth century drawing and recording paintings in Egypt. Their work was often published together, as N. de Garis Davies, and so it is usually difficult to determine who drew which illustration. Early life and adulthood Nina Nina M. Davies was born Anna Macpherson Cummings in Salonika, Greece, but returned to Scotland with the death of her father, Cecil in 1894. Her parents were of English and Scottish ancestry. Nina was schooled in England and showed considerable promise as an artist in her youth, with her family moving to London for her training. She was on a vacation in Alexandria, Egypt in 1906 when she met Norman de Garis Davies. They married in Hampstead, London on 8 October 1907 and settled near the Theban Necropolis and began documenting tomb paintings. Nina spent half of her time making drawings for the Metropolitan Museum and spent an equal amount of time replicating the tomb paintings for Alan Gardiner, which became part of collections at other museums. Nina developed a skill of quickly, accurately, and conscientiously capturing the images, creating a large number of facsimiles. Norman Norman de Garis Davies studied theology at Glasgow University, gaining a M.A. and B.D., and studied at Marburg University as a postgraduate. He was a Minister in the Congregational church at Ashton-under-Lyne when he first visited Egypt in 1897. He worked there for Flinders Petrie at Dendera. He became head of the Egypt Exploration Fund's Archaeological Survey. From about 1898 to 1907, Norman documented tombs in Egypt, such as Tell el-Amarna. He became an expert at interpreting the Egyptian hieroglyphics within the context of the painting. Norman de Garis Davies, Northern group of tombs, view of a cliff containing tomb numbers 28 to 104, Deir el-Gabrawi, 1902 Egyptologists Norman de Garis Davies, Nakht and Family Fishing and Fowling, Tomb of Nakht, Graphic Expedition, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1915 In 1907 an Egyptian Expedition was developed to make facsimiles of Egyptian Wall Paintings for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Norman, Nina, and other artists took tracings of the tombs, using a technique that allowed for nearly exact brushstroke and color replication. In most cases, the copies reflected the actual scene, including any damage that may have been sustained over time or as the result of vandalism. In a some cases, the drawings were rendered to look like they would have when created several thousand years ago. The Graphic Section effort was led by Norman, who had a dual-role interpreting the hieroglyphs and copying the images. The artists signed their work. Nina's signature was Na.deGD and Norman signed No.deGD, but there were also signatures of NdeGD where it was not clear if the work was performed by Nina or Norman. The tombs were located on the Nile's west bank of western Thebes. The museum was particularly interested in the tombs of officials, Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens royal tombs, and Deir el-Medina artists' tombs. These sites are, according to the Metropolitan Museum, \\"the richest source of ancient Egyptian paintings preserved anywhere in Egypt. The tomb images vary across dynasties and reigns, providing insight into daily life, flora and fauna changes, and ceremonial and burial customs in the distinct periods. Artistic techniques also varied across time. By 1941, about 350 facsimiles were painted and are now key displays in the Met's Egyptian department. They worked for the Egypt Exploration Society, London and Oriental Institute, Chicago by documenting other Egyptian sites, like Abydos and Amarna. In 1939, they returned to England. Norman died two years later. Nina died in 1965. Collections * Metropolitan Museum of Art has 413 total de Garis Davies items in its collection. Of those, 157 items painted by Nina, 15 with both of their names, and 59 by Norman, including: ** Nina de Garis Davies, Netting Birds, Tomb of Khnumhotep, Egypt, Middle Kingdom, Dynasty 12, Reign of Amenemhat II, ca. 1897‚Äì1878 B.C., Tempera on Pape, MMA graphic expedition 1931 ** Nina de Garis Davies, Sculptors at Work, Tomb of Rekhmire (TT 100), Egypt, New Kingdom, Dynasty 18, Reign of Thutmose III‚Äìearly Amenhotep II, ca. 1479‚Äì1425 B.C., Tempera on Paper ** Norman de Garis Davies, Leaders of a Group of Asiatics, Egypt, Middle Kingdom, Dynasty 12, Reign of Senwosret II, ca. 1887‚Äì1878 B.C., MMA graphic expedition 1931, Tempera on paper * British Museum had 22 of Nina de Garis Davies' paintings in 1936 given to the museum by Alan Gardiner, including: ** Nina de Garis Davies, Fig gatherers with baboons in the trees from the tomb of Khnumhotep II, Ancient Egypt & Sudan ** Nina de Garis Davies, Goldsmiths and Joiners, Ancient Egypt & Sudan Publications Some of the publications are:         * Notes and references References Further reading * External links *The rock tombs of El Amarna (1903) *The rock tombs of Deir el Gebr√¢wi (1902) Category:Scottish Egyptologists Category:Art duos Category:Married couples ","title":"N. de Garis Davies"},{"id":"24084424","text":"The relationship between multiculturalism and Islam is an important aspect in the overall debate on the soundness of the modern doctrine of multiculturalism.

The tembel hat was commonly worn by Jews in Israel from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1970s and was a symbol of hard-working, Zionist Israel. In Israeli cartoons it is still used to symbolize the typical Israeli (e.g., the cartoon character Srulik). Tembel hats were most notably produced by the ATA textile company.

There is a theory that the tembel hat was originally the heavy-duty hat of the Templers Christian movement that was active in Israel at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century. By this theory the hat's first name was \\"Templers' hat,\\" but it was changed to \\"tembel hat\\" by the Arabs who could not pronounce the P and the correct vowels. However, it is more likely that the name \\"tembel hat\\" derives from the Turkish or Ottoman word \\"tembel\\" which means lazy. The Tembel's shape is the same as the pileus, the hat adopted by freed slaves in Greek and Roman antiquity and adopted as a symbol of freedom at the time of the French Revolution. The ancient pileus survived in Albania in the early 20th century and may have influenced the leaders of the 2nd Aliyah who adopted the hat.

It was built by Thales Alenia Space, based on the Spacebus-4000B3 satellite bus, and carries 35 G/H band and 5 J band transponders (US IEEE C and Ku bands respectively). It was positioned in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 113¬∞ East, where it will replace the Palapa C2 satellite. Indosat ordered Palapa-D from Thales Alenia Space in 2007. The satellite was built without using American components, and was therefore not restricted by US International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which allowed the China Great Wall Industry Corporation to be selected as a launch service provider. On 31 August 2020, Palapa D was officially declared inadequate for operation after almost ran out of fuel for stationkeeping and all of its transponder services were officially moved to Telkom-4/Merah Putih and BRIsat satellites for broadcasting and data services respectively. Launch A Long March 3B rocket, flying from Launch Area 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre was used to launch Palapa-D. A problem with the third stage of its carrier rocket left it in an incorrect orbit, which was subsequently corrected using the spacecraft's onboard propulsion system. After launch, Palapa-D was to have separated from its carrier rocket into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, however one of its two identical upper-stage engines failed to deliver the necessary thrust,http://www.spacenews.com/launch/long-march-mishap-findings-due-mid- november.html resulting in it reaching a lower orbit than planned. The 400 newton apogee motor of the satellite was subsequently used in a non-nominal mode to raise it into geostationary orbit. Recovery and operations On 3 September, the satellite's orbit was adjusted, placing it into a geostationary transfer orbit. It reached geostationary orbit on 9 September. It underwent on-orbit testing, and arrived at its orbital slot of 113¬∞ East in mid- September. After completing its testing, it is now being used to provide communications to Asia and Australia. Palapa-D was built with a design life of fifteen years, but due to the expenditure of fuel during maneuvers to correct its orbit, it is expected to have enough fuel for about ten years of operations, according to Reynald Seznec, President of Thales Alenia Space. Replacement Palapa-D was planned to be replaced by Nusantara Dua (Palapa-N1) satellite; the launch of Nusantara Dua on 9 April 2020 by Chinese Long March 3B/E rocket was a failure, resulting in the loss of the satellite. A replacement satellite (Nusantara 2R or Palapa N1R) to be built by the same manufacturer (China Academy of Space Technology) is being considered, albeit with possible different specifications with the lost one.

It is a joined complex of several buildings. The main one, the church's sanctuary, is a limestone Gothic Revival structure built in the mid-19th century. Its congregation was the first church to be organized in Batavia, albeit as a Congregationalist group at that time. Over the next century various improvements and expansions would be made, using later architectural styles, reflecting changing styles of American Protestant worship. This transition was completed with changes to the sanctuary in the mid-20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Buildings and grounds The church occupies a parcel on the southeast corner of the intersection. A historic house separates the church property from another house of worship, First Baptist, to the east, with other old houses filling out the block to Swan Street. Another church, Resurrection Parish, is opposite, at the Summit Street Corner. West of the intersection are the commercial buildings of downtown Batavia. South of the church is another commercial building, with parking lots in the interior of the block to the southeast. Exterior The main church building consists of three separate sections, now joined. At the north, set back from East Main, is the original church, a three-by-five-bay structure faced in rock-cut limestone blocks with smooth-faced trim. A square bell tower pierces the wood-shingled low-pitched gabled roof. Just to the south, the lower Sunday school wing, also of limestone, has two cross-gables on its roof. A two-story hyphen connects it to the wood frame Memorial Service Building, a one-story structure topped by a high hipped roof with broad overhanging eaves. On the north (front) facade, the original church has corner buttresses. The entrances are heavy wooden lancet arched doors with beveled leaded glass panels set in angled reveals. Colonettes at the outer edge gradually become convex moldings at the doors' edge. Above the main entrance is a tripartite lancet-arch Gothic window topped by a blind quatrefoil in the gable field. The side entrance is separated by a buttress, topped with a small square pinnacle above the roofline and complemented by a larger conical pinnacle rising from the corner buttress. There are four stages to the bell tower, all set off by smooth-finished belt courses. Its corner buttresses continue to the top, gradually changing from square to circular as they do and becoming part of the crowning parapet along with a small pediment on each side. The stages are fenestrated, from top to bottom, with a single lancet arched window, double lancet-arched windows, a diamond panel and louvered Gothic window. The church's side elevations have one lancet-arch window per bay separated by buttresses. The Sunday school wing has large single Gothic windows on the west elevation, facing Liberty Street, and paired windows on the first story topped by paired windows in Tudor-arched openings on the other faces. To its south, the Memorial Service Building has wide shingle siding and large tripartite windows. Interior The sanctuary has two sets of pews divided by a broad center aisle. A serpentine balcony supported by iron columns covers the northern third, with a glazed screen creating a narthex. At the south end, a pulpit and lectern front a dais with Communion table in front of a dossal curtain is set in a crenellated Tudor Gothic wooden surround between two sets of organ pipes. On either side are the choir risers. The stained glass windows are set in a geometric pattern, each one having a diagonal stripe suggesting heraldric origin, with a floral design in yellow or pink at the top. A door in the southeast corner leads into the Sunday school wing. It features a two-story atrium, with the upper level accessible from stairs at a dais on the south end. It is finished primarily in plaster and dark-stained wood trim. Small classrooms are off to the sides on both levels. In the center of the ceiling is a large recessed circular light glazed with stained glass. The windows are done in marbleized glass in shades of amber or green in the classrooms and clear glass in the offices. The hyphen has entrances on the east and west. The Memorial Service Building is divided into three spaces. On the east is a lounge and meeting room. The southwest corner has a multi-purpose room with serving counters, and a kitchen. The remainder of the space west of the central hallway is given over to offices and restrooms. Finishes here are also plaster and stained wood. History alt=A view of the entrance tower of the First Presbyterian Church, Batavia, New York. The church, the first to be organized in the newly settled community, began as the First Congregational Society in 1809. Nine years later the society was reorganized as a Presbyterian church. This change in name was never recorded with the county clerk, which caused problems in 1853 when the church attempted to sell its original property to move into the current building since the property was still in the name of the Congregational Society. It required an act of the state legislature to resolve. It is not known who designed the current building, though it may have been the builder. The Gothic Revival styles were beginning to displace earlier, classically inspired modes such as the Federal and Greek Revival among new Protestant churches in the mid-19th century. Even denominations such as the more austere Calvinist denominations that had not embraced the more liturgical style of worship favored by the high church Anglican Ecclesiologists who had been the major proponents of Gothic Revival as the proper form for church buildings, began building churches in that style. The First Presbyterian Church demonstrates this embrace more on the exterior, with its slightly different roof pitches, pointed arches and early Romanesque Revival massing and fenestration, whereas the interior is the open auditorium with dais reflecting services focused primarily on lengthy sermons. Construction of the building cost $35,000 ($ in contemporary dollars), an amount well over the original budget. To furnish the interior, the women of the church gave $675 ($ in contemporary dollars). At the end of construction money was also saved by building the steeple of wood rather than stone. The first services were held on Thanksgiving Day in November 1855, with the formal dedication taking place the following spring. Within a year of construction, a blizzard knocked the original steeple over. The undamaged bell was put in the current steeple, built of stone as originally planned and paid for with a donation from a new congregant, John Fisher, who later represented the area in Congress. The church alone sufficed until 1882, when the north half of the Sunday school wing was added on to its rear. Its entrance remains on the west elevation. Six years later the balcony was added to the sanctuary to accommodate a growing congregation. In 1908, two decades after its construction, the Sunday school wing was doubled in size. In accordance with the Akron Plan developed by Lewis Miller and other influential religious educational theorists of the day, it also was reconfigured into the form of a two-story rotunda with classrooms surrounding the central space on both levels, to provide for a graded Sunday school where children could study the same Biblical lesson as their parents, but in a manner more appropriate to their developmental level, and then return to discuss it as a group. This was an increasingly common design or redesign for American Protestant churches of the era. After World War I, the last piece of the current complex, the Memorial Service Building, was erected. Its use of the Arts and Crafts style reflects that mode's pre-eminence at the time, particularly among YMCA buildings. Elbert Hubbard, leader of the Roycroft community in the nearby village of East Aurora, extolled traditional Protestant virtues of honesty, perseverance and personal responsibility, further contributing to the popularity of the Arts and Crafts style in religious architecture across denominations. With the installation of a new pipe organ in 1923, the first changes to the sanctuary were made. The original chancel had a small organ on one side of the dais with space for a small choir on the right of the pulpit. The newer, larger organ required two sets of pipes, and they were on both sides of the dais, with Tudor Gothic wood screens. A larger space was provided for a choir on the right. These changes reflected the growing use of music in the service. In 1928 the church reached its peak membership with 1,485 congregants. The last change to the sanctuary, in 1954, was the last step in moving from the sermon-based services of the church's founding to the more liturgical services Protestant congregations had come to prefer. Pulpits and lecterns were added on either side of the centrally located dais steps, and the choir pews were placed behind them. On the wall behind them the original pendant tracery was replaced with the current rose window. The original box pews were replaced with the current open oak pews. The church began the first of several renovations near the end of the century. A general renovation campaign began in 1994 and was completed in 1998. In 2003 a yearlong renovation of the bell tower began.; February 21, 2010; accessed January 6, 2011.

The college is one of the first business schools in the Philippines. History http://commerce.ust.edu.ph Established as a mere department of the College of Education and supervised by the Very Rev. Fr. Silvestre Sancho, O.P. in 1930, the Department of Commerce started with only twelve enrollees and offered a two-year associate program in Commercial Science. Consistent increase in enrollment lead to it being elevated into a School of Commerce in 1933 and the Department of Public Instruction granted its eventual recognition of the School's four-year degree program, Bachelor of Science in Commerce. Once the Bureau of Education allowed the School of Commerce to operate as a college, the College of Education granted its autonomy in 1935. Dr. Stanley Prescott was given the honor and the responsibility to be the first Dean of the College of Commerce. In 1940, Rev. Fr. Pedro Mateos, O.P. assumed the position of Dean and it was during his term where new review courses in Accounting and Law (for Accounting) were introduced to enhance the seniors‚Äô chances in passing the CPA licensure examinations. The College was forced to close during the Second World War. During the war the University was transformed into an American internment camp by the Japanese which was responsible for imprisoning more than 4,000 American citizens. It was later reopened in June 1945. In 1947, student enrollment reached 518 and steadily increased to 722 by 1948. Under the deanship of Dr. Mariano Apacible, the four major programs of the College: Accounting, Banking and Finance, Economics and Management, were fortified with pedagogy improvements as well as the introduction of new techniques in teaching. The student population at this time rose to 1,244. The year 1981, two years shy of the College's Golden Anniversary, the College offered a variety of strong academic programs: Accounting, Banking and Finance, Economics, Management and Marketing. In later years, the majors were limited to Accounting, Business Administration and Economics. Specialized courses in Management, Marketing, Banking and Finance were grouped into one major, Business Administration, to provide the graduates with more flexible and greater job opportunities in different fields of business and industry. To further improve the capacity to pass the board examinations of the College's aspiring CPA's, the academic program BS Commerce major in Accounting was replaced with Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. In 1988, the College officially became known as the College of Commerce and Accountancy and it was also in this year when the College applied for its re- accreditation (the first one was in 1984). The University of Santo Tomas College of Commerce Alumni Foundation, Inc (COCAFI), a private non-stock and non-profit foundation, was founded in 1992. In 1996, and in response to the growing information technology needs of the commercial industry, the College offered a new program: the B.S. Commerce major in Information System Management. However, due to the University's policy to group all computer- related programs in one College, this major was transferred to the College of Science in June 1999. The last batch of students with the degree B.S. Commerce major in Information Systems Management graduated in March 2002. In 1999, under Dean Amelia Halili, the College was selected as a Center of Development by the Commission on Higher Education. Also, for its Achievements in Accounting Education, as shown by the performance of its graduates in the CPA Board Examinations from 1996 to 2000, an Achievement Award was given to the College on November 15, 2000 by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) as it ranked first among those Colleges/Universities with 100 or more successful examinees. In 2004, the Department of Accountancy separated upon recommendation of and in coordination with the UST College of Commerce Alumni Foundation, Inc. (COCAFI) Thus, the accountancy unit was moved to the newly formed college AMV College of Accountancy. In the efforts towards asserting its presence as a primary model business school in the country, and pursuant to the Commission on Higher Education's Memorandum Number 17, the College revived its entrepreneurship program and offered the BSC in Entrepreneurship more popularly known as the Triple-E Program (‚ÄúEntrepreneurship and Ethics Education towards Equity‚Äù) in 2004 and a straight program, BS in Entrepreneurship was initially offered in 2007. The latter part of the 2006-2007 academic year signaled the beginning of even more significant changes compressed in even lesser time. With Dean Helena Maria F. Cabrera at the helm, and pursuant to the Commission on Higher Education's Memorandum Number 39, the Bachelor of Science in Commerce academic programs were gradually phased out and were replaced with the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration academic programs offering a wider range of specialized majors: Business Economics, Financial Management, Human Resource Development Management, Marketing Management and Operations Management (initially offering of this program has been deferred). The College was then renamed the College of Commerce and Business Administration in the same year when the BSBA major in Financial Management and BSBA major in Marketing Management were initially offered. It was in March 2009 when the University through the College first conferred these degrees on very first graduates of these degrees. Student population Faculty of Arts and Letters. The College of Commerce and Business Administration has almost 4,000 students, majority of which belongs to the Pre-Com Department which has now been renamed as the Basic Business Education Department (BBED). In recent years, it has been yielding the largest number of graduates (approx. 700-900). Facilities The college is located in the third and fourth levels of Saint Raymund de Pe√±afort Building in the northeastern part of the UST compound, facing Dapitan St. The college shares the building with the UST Faculty of Arts and Letters which occupies the first and second levels. The college has its own audio-visual conference room, a fully wired computer laboratory, a speech laboratory, Dean's Office, Coordinator's Room, Guidance Office, Student Organization Room, a Publication Office, a business development center, a faculty room, fully air-conditioned classrooms, free wi-fi access, and photocopying machines.

Its title track was named the greatest Brazilian song of all time by Rolling Stone in 2009.  Historical context  Constru√ß√£o signaled Buarque's fundamental artistic maturation, both in terms of musical composition and lyrical style, showcasing and transcending his mastery of MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira/Popular Brazilian Music). In addition to its significant esthetic achievement, the album's implicit criticism of the ruling Brazilian military dictatorship was greeted by the regime's opponents as an important cultural and socio-political statement, released as it was during the dictatorship's most repressive period. Because Buarque couched his criticism in such melodic beauty and lyrical obliqueness, and because of its popularity, the regime‚Äîsurprisingly‚Äîneither banned nor censored Constru√ß√£o.  Music  Buarque expertly imbued Constru√ß√£o's ten songs with elements of diverse musical styles. The first track, Deus lhe pague (God Bless You), was arranged with symphonic elements and rings with sardonic, barely veiled criticism of the government. Cotidiano (Daily), the second track, which chronicles the emotions and rituals in a day-in-the-life of a couple from the man's perspective, features a bluesy trumpet and is propelled by Afro- Brazilian percussion. Desalento (Discouragement), couched in a laid-back, bossa nova arrangement, is a confession of shortcomings and a plea for forgiveness, and is intentionally unspecific whether the context is personal or political. Constru√ß√£o (Construction), the fourth and title track, was arranged by Rog√©rio Duprat, blending bossa nova, MPB, and symphonic musical styles with Afro-Brazilian rhythms to emphasize the dodecasyllable verses (lines with twelve syllables), each of which ends in a proparoxytone word (a word with the stress on the antepenultimate syllable); it is arguably the album's most emotionally powerful piece. Cord√£o (Cord), the fifth track, is a defiant and uplifting bossa nova style declaration that opposes efforts to stifle an individual's creativity and freedom. The sixth track, Olha Maria (Look, Mary), is a beautiful and bittersweet tune recorded and performed with its cowriter, Antonio Carlos Jobim, as well as Lee Ritenour and Zimbo Trio. Buarque composed the gorgeous seventh track, Samba de Orly, with Toquinho and Vinicius de Moraes, and it is infused with both saudade and cautious hopefulness for political change in‚Äîand possible return to‚ÄîBrazil from the perspective of formal- and self-exiled politicians and artists, many of whom lived abroad during much of the military government's twenty-two years in power. With Valsinha (A Little Waltz), the album's eighth song, Buarque again teamed up with Vinicius de Moraes to compose a delicate love song of courtship with deep stylistic roots in Portuguese folk traditional music. The ninth track, Minha Hist√≥ria (My Story), a translation of 4/3/1943, an Italian song written by Lucio Dalla the same year, provides a thematic interlude in the album's narrative with a tale of a poor Brazilian boy christened \\"Jesus\\" by his unmarried mother. The last and tenth track, Acalanto (Lullaby), wraps up the album with a gentle cradle song tinged with sadness.  Acclaim and legacy  Constru√ß√£o ranks Number 3 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 greatest Brazilian albums of all time. The magazine also voted its title track as the greatest Brazilian song, stating that it \\"is still a reference to understand a thorny period of Brazilian society\\". It also ranks Number 54 in the list of the 100 greatest records of the 20th century by German music magazine Spex.http://www.poplist.de/poplist.php?l=470 On September 2012, it was elected by the audience of Radio Eldorado FM, of Estadao.com e of Caderno C2+M√∫sica (both the latter belong to newspaper O Estado de S.

Biography Born in Warsaw in the Russian Empire (now in Poland), Talmi joined Hashomer Hatzair at the age of 15, and in 1924, at the age of 19, made aliyah to Mandatory Palestine on her own. She worked in agriculture, building and road paving, but was frequently unemployed and ill. She eventually found a job working at a Kindergarten near Haifa, living in a hut belonging to the Kindergarten. In 1927 she joined kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek, where she worked as a kindergarten teacher. In 1931 she returned to Poland as a Hashomer Hatzair emissary, and met her future husband Meir. They later had three children, Yigal (1934), Yehuda (1940) and Binyamin (1946).

It was characterized by a set of wedge-shaped classrooms that radiated from the direction of a central superintendent's platform. Doors or movable partitions could be closed to separate the classes, or opened to allow the entire body of pupils to participate in school-wide exercises. Until about 1860, Sunday-school pupils of all ages were taught together in a single large room. After that, there was an increasing tendency for pupils to be taught separately, with instruction tailored to their ages, for most of the session. However, the superintendent conducted all-school exercises at the beginning and end of the session. To facilitate this, the building's interior layout had to enable the students to be quickly and efficiently divided into classes or brought together in a single body. The Akron Plan was devised to address this need. It took its name from the city of Akron in the state of Ohio in the Great Lakes region of the United States, where it was developed for the construction of a church built in 1866‚Äì67. It was quickly adopted by Protestant churches across the United States. The plan fell out of favor in the early 20th century, when Sunday schools changed their approach to one in which pupils were taught separately for the entire session, eliminating the school-wide exercises. The awkwardly shaped and imperfectly soundproofed rooms were poorly adapted for this new approach, and many of them underwent extensive remodelling. By the beginning of the 21st century, few intact Akron Plan interiors remained in existence. Sunday schools, 1780‚Äì1872 Robert Raikes The genesis of the Sunday school occurred in 1780 in Gloucester, England, when philanthropist Robert Raikes arranged for the teaching of a measure of literacy and religious instruction to slum children, most of whom worked six days a week and had Sunday as their only free day. The experiment proved successful and was taken up elsewhere; by Raikes's death in 1811, Sunday-school pupils numbered about a quarter-million, throughout the British Isles and in the United States. With the passage of time, the exclusive focus on lower-class children was abandoned. The expansion to upper classes was pioneered by, among others, noted divine Lyman Beecher, who in about 1830 sent his children to Sunday school, and encouraged his neighbors to do likewise. Instruction in reading and writing was dropped, and the schools devoted themselves to religious education. Through the first quarter of the 19th century, religious instruction in Sunday schools took the form of rote memorization of extensive passages from the Bible or the catechism; pupils might be tasked with memorizing as many as 300 verses a week. In about 1826, this began to give way to a new system, the \\"selected lesson\\" or \\"limited lesson\\", whereunder all pupils were given the same relatively short excerpt from Scripture to memorize, and were taught the passage's meaning and significance. Until about 1860, Sunday school was usually conducted in a single large room, with pupils of all ages learning the same lesson. This allowed all members of a family to discuss the lesson at home after church; but it was difficult to devise lessons that would be useful to all members of such a heterogeneous set of pupils, and the mix of ages tended to give rise to disciplinary problems. In response to this, and in keeping with the practice in the public schools, Sunday schools began to be divided into grades. In 1872, a national convention adopted the Uniform Lesson Plan, whereunder all students would study the same Scriptural passage but would be taught in a manner appropriate to their age. Uniform Lessons and Akron Plan Under the Uniform Lesson Plan, the grades were not to be kept separate for the entire duration of the session. Rather, the class was to begin with devotional exercises, led by the superintendent and involving the entire body of pupils. After this, the grades were to be taught separately. The session would end with the superintendent's leading, and the whole body's participating in, a five-minute review of the lesson followed by closing exercises. Lewis Miller This created a challenge for ecclesiastical architects. The Sunday-school building had to be designed in such a way that the pupils could quickly and efficiently be separated according to their various grades, and brought together for whole-school activities. John H. Vincent, an authority on Sunday schools in the Methodist Episcopal Church and later a bishop, described the architectural requirements: \\"Provide for togetherness and separateness; have a room in which the whole school can be brought together in a moment for simultaneous exercises, and with a minimum of movement can be divided into classes for uninterrupted classwork\\". One of those who addressed the design problem was Lewis Miller. A wealthy inventor and industrialist, Miller supervised a Sunday school in Canton, Ohio, and later one in Akron. There, he employed the graded system and experienced the problems that arose from unsuitable building designs. When the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Akron decided to construct a new building, Miller interested himself in the building's design. Working with architects Walter Blythe of Cleveland and Jacob Snyder of Akron, he devised a plan in which wedge-shaped classrooms were separated by partitions radiating from the direction of a central superintendent's platform. Doors on the platform-facing side of each classroom could be closed during grade-separated lessons, or opened to allow all pupils to see and hear the superintendent during school- wide exercises. The new church, following these plans, was constructed in 1866‚Äì67. Original Akron Plan The so-called Akron Plan was adopted by Protestant churches throughout the United States and the world, particularly after 1872, when the Fifth National Sunday-School Convention adopted the Uniform Lesson Plan. A 1911 American publication stated that \\"This plan for the Sunday-school building has been almost universally adopted in this country\\", and a 1914 publication stated that of the churches built in the preceding fifty years, three-quarters of those that made provisions for Sunday schools had used some version of the Akron Plan. Many of these churches modified the design with the addition of a movable partition between the sanctuary and the Sunday-school spaces, allowing the Sunday-school classes and the main body of congregants to be separated or united. Decline The Akron Plan was not without its failings. The divisions between the classrooms impeded worship by the whole body of pupils, compared to how they might have acted in a single large space. The wedge-shaped rooms were often poorly lighted and ventilated. Flimsy partitions and doors did not suffice to exclude distracting noises. In the early 20th century, the Uniform Lesson Plan began to fall out of favor. The requirement that the same Scriptural passages be taught to pupils of all grades was seen as unduly constraining: passages that adults could profitably study might be meaningless to small children. Moreover, the exclusive focus on Biblical passages made it difficult to study such things as church history and organization, missions, and latter-day issues such as temperance. Interior of 1914 Akron Plan church: Sunday-school rooms, seen from sanctuary through tambour doors In 1908, a convention of the International Sunday School Association approved the development of completely graded lesson plans. These were adopted by 35,000 Sunday schools during the following five years. With the different grades no longer studying the same topic during a given week, there was no longer a place for the superintendent's review of the whole school. School-wide assemblies became infrequent, eliminating the need for a means of quickly bringing the whole body of pupils together. The change in Sunday-school organization did away with the advantages of the Akron Plan. The oddly shaped rooms could not readily be turned to other purposes without extensive modification. While Akron Plan churches continued to be built into the 1920s and 1930s, many existing churches were remodelled to create more useful interior spaces. By the beginning of the 21st century, few intact Akron Plan interiors remained. Notes References *Chambers, Murphy & Burge, Restoration Architects, Ltd.

He moved to Stuart, Florida in the early 2000s where he set up a company to build and operate recreational submarines. He then moved his firm to the United Arab Emirates, branded as Exomos. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis in October 2008, Exomos ceased to exist. Jaubert was found guilty of embezzlement by a Dubai Court and has been sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to repay AED 14 million. Jaubert fled the country within the year after being accused of embezzlement and subsequently returned to Stuart, where he is a permanent US resident. Events in the United Arab Emirates Embezzlement and escape In 2004 Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem visited Jaubert's factory in Florida and invited him to move his firm to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Jaubert accepted the invitation and bin Sulayem put him in charge of a new subsidiary of Dubai World. There Jaubert set up a submarine manufacturing company with a factory, which after two years started making tourist submarines and superfast boats: it made four mini-submarines, a submersible yacht, and a larger submarine called Nautilus which could carry nine people. Juabert was put in charge of a newly formed subsidiary of Dubai World that Bin Sulayem chaired, which is the same company behind the development of Palm Jumeirah and World Islands. He lived with his American wife and two children in a villa with private swimming pool. According to Dubai courts, auditors investigating the company accounts found gaps and equipments that Mr Jaubert had ordered from his own company in Florida failed to arrive, or parts were faulty. He was alleged to have short-changed Dubai World by AED 14 million. According to Jaubert, the company wanted to pull the plug on the venture but wanted to blame someone first. Jaubert was questioned by auditors and the police. According to Jaubert, the police threatened Jaubert to \\"insert needles into your nose again and again\\". According to Jaubert, he promised to pay back the AED 14 million to buy time to escape. He was court ordered to stay in the country and hand his passport due to being under investigation. The court found Jaubert guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to five years in prison and ordered him to repay AED 14 million. According to Jaubert's account, he got to Fujairah, where a set of frogman's kit was smuggled to him in parts. One night in May 2008 he put this frogman's kit on, and an Arab woman's abaya over it as a disguise. He slipped from his hotel to the beach at night disguised under the abaya and swam to the area's only police patrol boat, which was in a coastguard station, and climbed onto the boat and clogged its fuel lines to prevent pursuit. Next morning he made his escape on a rubber dinghy with a small outboard motor, and sailed and waited in international waters for six hours to a prearranged meeting with a former fellow spy in a sailing boat, just outside United Arab Emirates territorial waters. The sailing boat carried him in eight days to Mumbai in India, and from there in 2008 he went home to Florida. After Jaubert fled, Dubai World and Dubai police accused Jaubert of embezzlement and escape, and said that at least two of his submarines he was contracted to work on did not work.  Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum  On March 4, 2018, Herv√© Jaubert and a Finnish woman, Tiina Jauhiainen, attempted to allegedly help Dubai Princess Latifa escape from Dubai. They were intercepted by Indian and Emirati special forces and were taken from a yacht off the coast of Goa, India. Two weeks later he was released, along with Jauhiainen and the three Filipino crew.India accused of violating international treaties in sending back runaway Dubai princess In December 2018, Helene Jaubert, the American ex-wife of former French Navy officer Herv√© Jaubert told American news website The Daily Beast that Herv√© Jaubert and Radha Stirling had been in contact with princess Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum (II) for 5 years and invented the whole disappearance scheme together. According to Helene, ‚ÄúThe whole plan was for Herve to help her escape and once he got her out the daughter was going to get to the dad and say I want $3 million or else I‚Äôll tell all to the media‚Äù. According to Helene, \\"It was a con. It‚Äôs a corrupt scheme gone haywire\\". According to Stirling, Latifa phoned her from the boat in the middle of the ambush, saying she feared for her life and ‚Äúwas hearing gunshots.‚Äù According to Stirling, Latifa made the call via WhatsApp and evidence of the call was provided to authorities in the USA and UK and made available to reporters, although The Daily Beast pointed out that a satellite phone is normally needed to call from their alleged location in the Indian Ocean. Trials On 28 June 2009 a court in Dubai tried Jaubert in absentia and found him guilty and sentenced him to 5 years imprisonment. George Dalton, Dubai World's chief counsel, stated in an interview in September 2009 that he was confident that a US Court would return a similar verdict against Jaubert. On 9 September 2009 Jaubert filed a lawsuit in Martin County Court in Florida against Dubai World, for defamation, fraud, abuse of process by the Dubai police, and false imprisonment. On 28 February 2011 at Fort Pierce, Florida the court rejected all Dubai World's claims against Herve Jaubert of breach of contract, fraud, embezzlement and theft. The court also found against Jaubert's claim of abuse of process, and Jaubert was not awarded any money damages or other relief.

Built largely on permafrost during 1975-77 between Prudhoe Bay and Valdez, Alaska, the $8 billion effort required tens of thousands of people, often working in extreme temperatures and conditions, the invention of specialized construction techniques, and the construction of a new road, the Dalton Highway. The first section of pipe was laid in 1975 after more than five years of legal and political arguments. Allegations of faulty welds drew intense scrutiny from local and national observers. A culture grew around the unique working conditions involved in constructing the pipeline, and each union that worked on the project had a different function and stereotype. Thirty-two Alyeska Pipeline Service Company employees and contract workers were killed during the project. The main construction effort lasted until 1977; the first barrel of oil was delivered on July 28 of that year. Several more pump stations, added as oil flow increased, were completed through 1980.  Survey and design  Intensive geological sampling and survey work of the pipeline route started in spring 1970. Aerial photograph were taken, examined, and a preliminary route was detailed.Mead, p. 177 Small survey parties physically visited the route and hammered stakes into the ground. The work was difficult; animal dangers forced the crews to be armed, and they also had to cope with the remote area and limited infrastructure. In places, the foliage was so dense that trees had to be cut down and progress was limited to per day.Mead, p. 178 The surveyed route passed through several mountain passes: Atigun Pass, Isabel Pass, Thompson Pass, and Keystone Canyon.Mead, p. 179 In the latter location, surveyors had to rappel down cliffs in order to perform their work. Pipeline on slider supports where it crosses the Denali Fault. Surveyors and planners also had to deal with the Denali Fault, a major cause of earthquakes, and with large amounts of permafrost.Mead, p. 181 In 1969, the unincorporated Trans- Alaska Pipeline System group drilled a series of core samples north of the Brooks Range that demonstrated how ubiquitous the permafrost was along the route. This forced the design of an elevated pipeline, which was tested in a loop built near Barrow.Mead, p. 182 This elevation required the pipeline to be insulated, since extreme cold temperatures caused the metal to become brittle, even when hot oil was being pumped through the pipeline.Mead, p. 183 After ecological objections forced subterranean pipeline crossings (in order to allow caribou to cross), engineers developed a system by which the ground near the pipeline would be refrigerated by chilled brine. These refrigerated sections also would be placed in Styrofoam-lined trenches and covered with gravel for their insulation value. Altogether, of the pipeline was designed to be built underground in this way. In other places, a lack of permafrost meant it could simply be placed underground without a special refrigeration plant.Mead, pp. 187-188 Large amounts of gravel were needed for all sections of the pipeline as insulation to keep the heat of above-ground structures from melting the permafrost. Gravel also was needed to build the construction and maintenance road, and surveyors located 470 sites across Alaska where the needed of gravel could be located.Mead, p. 189 The Pipeline Authorization Act required the pipeline to be able to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon- coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.Mead, p. 192 Radiators atop heat pipes keep permafrost below the pipeline frozen. Because most of the pipeline was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below the pipeline warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator on top of each stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back to the bottom of the tube, where the process repeats.Mead, pp. 192-193 The surveyed route crossed hundreds of streams and rivers. To cross these with the pipeline, engineers designed concrete \\"jackets\\" to surround the pipe and weight it down so it would sink to the bottom of the stream or river. Because oil is lighter than water, the pipeline would float without the concrete jackets. Dredging rivers and burying the pipeline in the streambed was not allowed due to environmental concerns. In several places‚Äîeither out of fear of disturbing the river or because of the river's characteristics‚Äîpipeline bridges were constructed. The most notable of these are over the Yukon River and the Tanana River.Mead, pp. 192-194 To protect against corrosion in these wet environments, the pipeline was designed with cathodic protection.Mead, p. 195 In terms of spill prevention, the pipeline was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak out of a hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, and other features. The pipeline was designed to be pressurized, so any leak would be instantly detected by a loss of pressure at one of the pump stations, which could sound an alarm and halt the flow of oil quickly.Mead, pp. 196-197 The original pipeline proposal called for an initial capacity of , then an increase to after two years, and then a further increase to at an indeterminate time thereafter. The events of the 1973 oil crisis caused a review of these plans, and the initial capacity was revised upwards to . This in turn required that eight pumping stations (instead of the originally-planned five) be ready at startup, greatly increasing the construction manpower required.Mead, p. 206  Valdez Marine Terminal  The Valdez Marine Terminal, the southern end of the pipeline, was planned for a site across the Port Valdez fjord from Valdez proper. Initial studies predicted bedrock would be six feet below the surface of the ground, but when excavation began, it was discovered that bedrock actually was sixty feet down, requiring the removal of of overburden. The terminal itself was designed to be built with four tanker berths and space for a fifth, should it become necessary. Holding tanks were planned that had a capacity equal to that of the pipeline, allowing the whole pipeline to be emptied if required.Mead, p. 201 As required by the Pipeline Authorization Act, a ballast-water filtration system had to be designed as well. This system removes oil from tankers' ballast water so it is not released into Prince William Sound‚Äîsomething fishermen feared when the pipeline was proposed.Mead, pp. 202-203  Preparation  Before construction of the Dalton Highway, special vehicles like the Sno-Freighter were needed to take supplies north of the Yukon River. Shortly after the permit was signed, convoys of equipment on snow tractors began heading north, using hardened snow roads and an ice bridge over the Yukon River to reach the seven construction camps that had been dormant since 1970. In the 83 days from mid-January to the time the snow and ice melted in mid-April, 680 workers moved to the seven camps, and built five more camps and five temporary airstrips.Roscow, p. 96 In February, as the ice bridge and snow road were carrying tracked vehicles north, Alyeska awarded a contract to design the construction and maintenance road. Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., a firm in Pennsylvania, was awarded the contract.Mead, p. 207 To cross the Yukon River, the state of Alaska designed a bridge and paid two-thirds of its cost. The remaining third was paid by Alyeska, and the bridge was built by Manson-Osberg-Ghemm.Roscow, p. 97 On April 5, the contracts to build the road were picked. In total, the new Dalton Highway cost $185 million to build, and four companies shared that cost. Construction of the Dalton Highway started on April 29, and at the peak of the effort, Alyeska and the four subcontractors had more than 3,400 workers deployed from the Yukon River to Prudhoe Bay. A massive airlift was created to supply the road construction effort; more than 700 flights per day‚Äî170,000 in total‚Äîwere required before the road was finished on September 29. In just 154 days, a 360-mile gravel road had been built. Final grading had to be done and more than 20 small permanent bridges had to be built, but by November, the road was open to traffic crossing the Yukon River on another ice bridge.Roscow, p. 99  Management  To supervise the construction of the pipeline, Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee all the other subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor for the pipeline itself. Fluor Alaska Inc., a division of Fluor Corp., was named the management contractor for the pumping stations and Valdez Marine Terminal, which was the most complex single section of the pipeline, since it involved the transfer of oil from the pipeline to seagoing oil tankers.Roscow, p. 100 Neither of those two companies actually did the construction work. That job was handed off to a series of subcontractors, each of whom had responsibility on one (or two) of six sections of the pipeline (seven, if the marine terminal is included). Bidding on the subcontracting jobs opened at the end of March, and the contracts were announced on June 12, 1974. On Section One, which ran from Valdez to the Sourdough pipeline camp, River Construction Corporation, a division of Morrison-Knudsen, was given the contract. For Section Two, which covered from Sourdough to north of Delta Junction, Perini Arctic Associates, a joint venture of Perini Corporation, Majestic Construction, Wiley Oilfield Hauling Ltd., and McKinney Drilling Company. Section Three covered from Delta Junction, past Fairbanks, and almost to the Yukon. The contract for this section was given to H.C. Price, a group formed by H.C. Price Company (usually known as PPCO), R.B. Potashnick, Codell Construction Company, and Oman Construction Company. Section Four was from south of the Yukon to Coldfoot. It was contracted to Associated-Green, a group formed by Associated Pipeline Contractors, Inc. and Green Construction Company. The group also was one of the main contractors for construction of the Dalton Highway.Roscow, p. 101 Section Five covered the distance from Coldfoot to Toolik pipeline camp, and Section Six went from Toolik to Prudhoe Bay. Together, the two sections covered , and they both were under the supervision of Arctic Constructors, a venture of Brown & Root Inc., Ingram Corporation, Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., Williams Brothers Alaska, Inc., and H.B. Zachry Company. In Valdez, where Fluor had supervision, the work also was divided among several contractors. Site preparation work was done by Morrison- Knudsen. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company built the tank farms, the tanker berths were built by Kiewest (a venture of Peter Kiewit Sons and Willamette-Western Corporation), and General Electric insulated the pipes.Roscow, pp. 101-102 Fluor also had supervision of the construction of the pumping stations, which were generally built by the contractors working on a specific section of the pipeline.  Pipeline camps  A map of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline with pump stations and construction camps identified. When the contracts were announced, Alyeska already had 12 pipeline construction camps either built or under construction. These camps were all north of the Yukon, however, and camps had to be built along the entire length of the project. Alyeska planned for 29 construction camps, but 31 were created.Cole, p. 66 Seven were built along the pipeline south of the Yukon, and one was built at each of the 12 pump stations along the length of the route. The camps were built on thick beds of gravel laid down to insulate the underlying permafrost and to prevent pollution. At the conclusion of the construction project, the gravel was removed, theoretically removing oil leaks and other pollution with it.Cole, p. 71 Atop the gravel were prefabricated modular buildings either flown to the site or trucked across the Dalton Highway. The standardized structures could house 28 people, and two typically were bolted together to create two \\"wings\\". All were one-story, except at Valdez and at the pump station camps, where modules were laid atop one another because of space concerns.Cole, p. 67 In addition to the gravel insulation, both buildings and utility conduits were raised above the ground to avoid heating permafrost.Cole, p. 72 The camps housed from 250 people (at each pump station) to 3,500 people (at Valdez). A typical pump station camp cost $6 million to build, while the typical mainline camps cost about $10 million to build. The camps had beds for 16,500 workers and were collectively referred to as \\"Skinny City\\" by workers. The name came from the fact that the \\"city\\" was long, but only a few hundred feet wide. Overall construction headquarters was at Fort Wainwright near Fairbanks, where Alyeska leased land and buildings from the U.S. Army. Vacant barracks were converted into housing, and vacant offices were given to oil workers. As air traffic increased, Alyeska arranged for the use of Fort Wainwright's airfield to relieve the burden on Fairbanks International Airport. The camp at Wainwright was the only one that did not use prefabricated buildings.  Workers  The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was built entirely with unionized labor. Because construction was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers from across the country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives,Mead, pp. 244-248 and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions.Roscow, p. 103 In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits.McGrath, p. 19 According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible.Mead, p. 242 In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, so there was no incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays.Cole, pp. 28-31 At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women.Facts, p. 17 Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.Ross, Mike. \\"Tales from Pipeline Camp\\" , KTUU NBC-2. July 24, 2007. Accessed July 9, 2009.  Welders  The welders who worked on the pipeline itself came from Pipeliners Local 798 out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which specialize in providing welders for large-scale pipeline projects.Cole, p. 57 Members of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada performed all welding that was not a part of the pipeline itself, including pump stations, feeder pipelines, and work at the Valdez Marine Terminal.Wickware, pp. 8-9 The welders were the highest paid of all the workers on the pipeline, with a normal rate of $18.25 per hour.Cole, p. 58 To be hired on the pipeline project, welders had to go through an intensive certification process that involved a series of test welds. If a welder failed any of the test welds, he was not hired and was not allowed to try again for several weeks.Wickware, p. 14 Most 798ers were characterized by a Southern accent, cowboy boots, and unique welder's hats.McGrath, p. 36 They were the only people to weld the pipe of the main pipeline, and outside observers characterized them as arrogant and \\"redneck\\". An example of their attitude was how they dealt with the situation regarding lunch, in late 1975. Alyeska had said they would provide hot lunches wherever possible, and in reality this ended up being whoever was working closest to the camps, while those working further away carried bagged lunches to their worksite. After complaints of how this was unfair (since certain unions were far more favored than others by this policy), Alyeska decided that no one would get hot lunches. But then the welders from 798 starting cooking their own lunches (against camp rules) using steaks taken from the kitchen freezers on makeshift grills whose burners were their acetylene torches.Roscow, p. 152Mead, p. 263 As a fellow welder stated at the time, \\"Take your typical 798 pipeline welder and feed him a few drinks, and he'll probably tell you that he's God's greatest gift to welding.\\"Wickware, p. 9 This attitude generated resentment from other pipeline workers, and the conflict caused large-scale brawls. In some instances, Alaska State Troopers had to be flown to pipeline camps in order to break up small riots.Cole, pp. 60-63 Toward the end of the pipeline project, a series of bumper stickers was produced with the slogan \\"Happiness is 10,000 Okies going south with a Texan under each arm.\\"  Teamsters  The Teamsters Union was by far the largest and most notable contributor of workers to the pipeline project. Teamsters worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project. All trucks were driven by Teamsters, supply warehouses were run by Teamsters, and the buses that transported workers from camps to job sites were run by Teamsters.Wickware, p. 175 Teamsters Local 959, with more than 23,000 employees at its peak,Time Magazine. \\"Alaska Gold\\", Time.com. May 17, 1976. Accessed July 9, 2009. was by far the most dominant labor force on the pipeline project.McGrath, p. 35 There were frequent allegations of corruption by Teamsters on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two Teamsters leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on the pipeline project.Cole, p. 142-145 Teamsters workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, and pointed to the fact that 80 percent of the Teamsters in the project had college degrees or professional and management experience.Cole, p. 143 The Teamsters' control of tools and equipment in warehouses they ran led to conflicts with other workers. In a few instances, Teamsters were assaulted by workers from other unions.McGrath, p. 38Wickware, pp. 164-165 In other instances, the Teamsters used their position to extract concessions from Alyeska and the subcontractors. Although they were forbidden from striking, they were allowed to halt work for safety meetings, and this excuse was used on a handful of occasions.Wickware, pp. 174-187 The most notable of these was in February 1975, after a series of serious truck accidents on the Elliott Highway, which connected to the newly built Dalton. The Elliott, which had not been upgraded, was a treacherous drive for trucks hauling of pipe. After his attempts to get Alyeska to upgrade the road were rebuffed, Teamster leader Jesse Carr stopped all truck traffic in the state for four days of safety meetings. Alyeska and the state promised upgrades to the road, and the traffic resumed.Cole, p. 40  Operators  The International Union of Operating Engineers (called Operators for short) represented the men and women who sat at the controls of the heavy equipment used on the construction of the pipeline. This equipment included bulldozers, cranes, drilling rigs, and sidebooms‚Äîa cross between a bulldozer and a crane that could lay a section of pipe in a trench parallel to its tracks. Because most of the heavy equipment was unheated, six operators were typically assigned to each piece of equipment, allowing for frequent breaks. A popular joke on the pipeline was that the sole qualification to be an Operator was, \\"Must be able to sit on a sideboom at 40 below and not freeze up.\\"Cole, p. 210 More seriously, one laborer wrote, was that there was nothing more terrifying than to be in a trench and have a drunken or unskilled Operator handling the pipe that was being laid in the trench.McGrath, pp. 59-60  Laborers  The Laborers International Union represented the bulk of the less-skilled labor on the project. Laborers, as they were commonly known, did most of the odd jobs on the project: digging trenches in areas inaccessible by heavy equipment, drilling holes for the pipeline's Vertical Support Members, spreading gravel, crushing rock, and moving supplies by hand.McGrath, pp. 50-54 Laborers Local 942 out of Fairbanks was the most prominent Laborers group on the project, and because no special skills were required for the jobs it filled, the Laborers Union attracted most of the people who came to Alaska specifically for the pipeline project.Cole, pp. 24-26 As one Laborer put it, they were people \\"simply looking for the easiest way possible of getting through the day.\\"McGrath, p. 57 Because the Laborers had more applicants than jobs available, the process for getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process. There were multiple levels of eligibility, based on the amount of seniority a person had. A-level members had the first pick of jobs, but they had to have worked at least 800 hours with the union in the previous year. B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 hours with the union. C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was for everyone else, and D-level people rarely got jobs.Cole, p. 26 That didn't stop people from trying. At 11 a.m. on January 1, 1974, shortly before the pipeline right-of-way was signed, more than 100 people spent the night outside the Fairbanks office of the Laborers Union, waiting for the first choice of jobs when the office opened.Cole, p. 27  Pipeline life  Life during the pipeline construction project was characterized by long hours, poor conditions, and limited entertainment compensated by excellent benefits and pay. Each worker was handed a small booklet of 23 camp rules,Cole, pp. 89-90 but the rules (including no alcohol or smoking) were frequently brokenCole, p. 75 and became the target of ribald humor. Within the living quarters, the atmosphere resembled that of a college dormitory.Wickware, pp. 4749 Housekeeping and laundry services were provided, but the quarters were small and little entertainment was available. Television broadcasts were delayed two days because of the need to fly tapes from California,Cole, pp. 103-105 and most workers had to develop their own forms of entertainment. In the winter, some took to skiing or sightseeing; in the summer, some went hiking.Cole, p. 79 In general, however, little time was available for recreation because of the long hours worked by most people. In the first years of the project, workers were regularly treated to prime rib, steak dinners, and other exotic fare due to a cost-plus contract between the food preparers and the subcontractors.Cole, pp. 9198 In later years, these cost-plus contracts were replaced, and institutional cooking and box lunches became common, but the food on the project was still prized by many workers.McGrath, pp. 106108Cole, p. 91 As soon as the haul road, later named the Dalton Highway, was built, the food and the overtime for some unions changed. The highway construction was charged to the federal and state governments and was supposed to be cost plus. There were no more steak nights one to two times a week and the Australian rock lobster tails disappeared. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) LU 1547 was one union that had overtime on Sundays changed from double time to time-and-one-half upon completion of the haul road. In 1976, workers' pay averaged between $11 and $18 per hour, depending on the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became what to do with so much extra money.Cole, p. 119 Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500.Cole, p. 118 The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars.Cole, p. 123 Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.Cole, pp. 124-125  Laying pipe  The pipeline crosses the Tanana River on a bridge north of Delta Junction. The first section of the Trans-Alaska pipeline was laid on March 27, 1975, in the Tonsina River.Roscow, p. 143 Several forty-foot sections of pipe were welded together and coated in concrete prior to the ceremony. Twelve sidebooms (bulldozers with side-mounted cranes) together lifted of pipe, which was laid in a trench dug perpendicular to the riverbed. Bulldozers filled in the exposed trench with gravel, restoring the river's original contours. This process was repeated a few miles south, where the pipeline crossed the Little Tonsina River. By the end of April, the first of elevated pipeline also was built in the same area.Roscow, p. 144 In 1975, the first year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of completing 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground. The pipeline runs under this riverbed, emerging to cross a ridge on the opposite bank. Pipeline inspection access road is visible as well Laying pipe took several stages. First, the right of way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and scrapers who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.Mead, p. 228 After the path was finalized came the augers and drillers for the holes that served as foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled with a mix of water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.Mead, pp. 230-231 The construction progressed under the management of Frank Moolin, Jr., an engineer who had worked on refinery projects in Singapore and the construction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system prior to being named senior project manager.Roscow, p. 145 Moolin became known for his work ethic and his hard-driving style. It was said that he was the first person in the office and the last to leave at the end of the day.Cole, p. 33 The Engineering News-Record reported \\"He demands total dedication, saying, 'Your wife had a baby; so what?'\\" when it named him the construction industry's Man of the Year in 1976.Cole, p. 35 To spur progress on the pipeline, he started the \\"Alyeska Sweepstakes,\\" in which each of the five contractors working on the pipeline were compared to each other based on how much of their share they completed on time.Cole, p. 36 In his biggest decision, he canceled Bechtel's contract as management contractor because he felt the company was adding too much bureaucracy between Alyeska and the pipeline contractors.Roscow, p. 146 A historian later called the decision \\"one of the most humiliating defeats\\" in the history of Bechtel. In October, snow and cold weather brought most of the pipeline laying to a halt for the year. Employment rose from 12,000 workers in the spring to more than 21,000 in the summer and down to 7,000 at Christmas.Mead, p. 233 Alyeska estimated that the pipeline laying was about 50 percent complete: of pipeline were welded and in place. But work on the pump stations and in Valdez lagged; the project as a whole was only 35 percent complete when the pumps were factored in.Mead, p. 234  Speeding up construction  During the winter of 1975-1976, Moolin pronounced himself dissatisfied with progress, but promised improvements. \\"We've learned an awful lot. This year (1975) was a pull-ourselves-up-by-our- bootstraps operation. We didn't really have our organization set until July, and it wasn't working at top effectiveness until October.\\"Roscow, p. 157 To take advantage of that \\"top effectiveness\\", Moolin set an ambitious goal for 1976 construction: \\"We're expecting to have all of the line installed, insulated, and hydro-tested by November 1,\\" he said in January.Roscow, p. 162 That goal was ambitious, because most of the work that had been done to that point was on floodplains and flat terrain. Still left to tackle were difficult construction projects in Atigun Pass and Keystone Canyon. \\"In some areas, we did eat our cake last year,\\" Moolin said.Roscow, p. 163 Even though winter shut down all pipelaying on the right of way, work on the pump stations and in Valdez continued without stop.Roscow, p. 160 At Pump Station 1, in Prudhoe Bay, temperatures reached lower than ,Roscow, p. 159 but the work continued. Because the pump station was the origin point for the main pipeline, it also had to process the feeder lines coming from oil wells. The pump station camp had a population of 270 workers through the winter, and it would peak in the summer with 430 workers.Roscow, p. 161  Welding controversy  Etchings on a pipeline vertical support member indicates when a nearby weld was X-rayed by quality control inspectors. As the weather warmed and work resumed on the main pipeline, Alyeska administrators were occupied by a controversy about pipeline welds that had been done the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds.Roscow, p. 151 The Trans- Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders. At the end of 1975, Alyeska terminated Ketchbaw's contract and took responsibility for analyzing weld X-Rays itself. The controversy continued, however, as Kelley's lawsuit moved forward, a Ketchbaw manager was found dead of cyanide poisoning, and photographs of welds were stolen from a pump station construction camp.Roscow, p. 165 Alyeska began a review of all 30,800 welds that had been done in 1975, and submitted its report to the Interior Department in April 1976. In May, it submitted its technical analysis and a report on repair work under way. The review produced a list of 3,955 questionable welds‚Äî10 percent of 1975's work. Alyeska reported that about half were too minor to affect the running of the pipeline, but questions lay with more than a thousand welds that might be dangerous. Re-examining the welds would be extremely difficult, since those sections of pipeline were sealed (and in many cases buried).Roscow, p. 166 By July, the U.S. Congress began holding hearings into the welding problems. President Gerald Ford sent a team to Alaska to oversee and examine Alyeska's work. At the recommendations of this team and to avoid further investigations, Alyeska began repairing the welds on its own. By September, more than 3,000 of the questionable welds had been redone or certified as safe.Roscow, p. 167 Alyeska asked for waivers on the remaining 612 welds, and more hearings resulted. By the end of November, only 34 welds were still at issue. The leader of Ford's team ordered 31 of the welds to be dug up and re-done. Waivers were granted for the other three welds only, all of which were buried under the Koyukuk River south of the Brooks Range. Proof of the integrity of those three questionable yet inaccessible welds were evaluated by a unique solution in Section Five north of the Brooks Range. On either side of the Sagavanirktok River, the above ground pipeline was cut upon and 48 inch fans installed to circulate air. Then a team of 12 men and inspectors riding on wheeled sleds pulled by a modified John Deere lawnmower entered the pipe. Welds were counted during the passage. After arriving at the questionable weld under the Sagavanirktok River, an ultrasound was taken on the inside of the pipe. Then the team exited the pipe on the opposite side and the ultrasound was taken back to camp for evaluation. Alyeska estimated the total cost of redoing the welds to be $55 million.  Atigun, Keystone, and Sag River  The portion of the pipeline beneath the Sagavanirktok River, seen here, caused problems for construction workers. Many of the suspected faulty welds were in Section Five of the pipeline construction project‚Äîthe northernmost .Roscow, p. 170 This area also included two of the major problems encountered during the 1976 construction season: Atigun Pass and the Sagavanirktok River (also known as Sag River). The pipeline had been laid in a trench beneath the river in the late fall of 1975. Because it had been laid so late in the season, the trench fill material had frozen and it was impossible to fill the submerged trench containing the pipeline. Spring snowmelt flooded the river and battered the submerged portion of pipe. In June, the battered pipeline broke free of its moorings and a 1,700-foot (518 m) section of concrete-coated pipe floated to the surface of the river. Because doing repair work would interfere with the migration of Arctic char, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game allowed only 24 hours for the project. After preparing the site, it took just four hours for a replacement trench to be dug, a pipe welded and laid in the trench, and the trench to be filled in. At Atigun Pass, to the south of the Sag River, workers had to deal with a different set of challenges. In 1975, surveyors discovered the pass was filled with permafrost and glacial soils. But because the pass is the site of frequent avalanches, an elevated pipeline was not possible. The solution was to design a reinforced, insulated ditch to lay the pipeline in. The result was a 6,000-foot (1.83 km) long concrete box lined with of Styrofoam. The problem then became one of building it before the first snow started falling in October.Roscow, pp. 170-171 At the opposite end of the pipeline, just north of Valdez, engineers coped with the difficulties posed by Keystone Canyon. The canyon was the only route to Valdez, but it was occupied by the Richardson Highway and the Lowe River; no room was available for the pipeline.Roscow, p. 172 The only solution was to avoid the canyon by building the pipeline through the Chugach Mountains and at the rim of the canyon. Winter work was made impossible by the more than of snow that fell in the winter of 1975-1976, and when the snow melted, construction workers had to figure out how to travel up a 60 percent grade, then lay the pipeline on it. A rock-crushing plant was built at the canyon's rim to avoid the need to carry gravel up the steep grade, but problems still persisted. Not even bulldozers could traverse the grade without a team of two helping each up the grade in turn. A bulldozer had to be modified to carry 80-foot (20.4-meter) sections of pipe up the grade, but even then, most of the sections and equipment had to be lifted by helicopter to the canyon rim. Similar techniques had to be used at nearby Thomson Pass, and both sections required the entire 1976 construction season to complete.Roscow, p. 173  Pump stations and marine terminal  Pump Station 9 as seen in 1994. Work at the pump stations and marine terminal, which had not stopped during the winter, continued throughout the 1976 construction season. Pump Station 6, just south of the Yukon River, had to be redesigned after excavation revealed ice-rich permafrost below the site. Five pump stations needed at startup (when throughput was lower) received their pumps, turbines, and piping. As they were completed, the pump stations received hydrostatic testing, in which portions of pipe were filled with water and subjected to pressures in excess of the eventual operating conditions. Following this testing, the initial five pump stations were disconnected from the main pipeline and had oil run through them on a continuous loop. \\"It's very similar to your new automobile,\\" one worker said. \\"You drive it around for ten days so that any components that are going to fail are given time to fail.\\" Work on additional pump stations, which would not be needed until the pipeline was brought to full capacity, was not pressed forward. At Valdez, construction was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried to complete the marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed by the end of the year.Roscow, p. 174 During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center‚Äîwhere two new control computers had been installed‚Äîto Pump Station 2 on the North Slope.Roscow, p. 175 Although the project made strides toward completion in 1976, it did not meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final section of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, but not all of the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.Roscow, p. 176  Finishing the line  The E. L. Patton Yukon River Bridge was not completed until October 1979. Few tasks were left to complete when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup was in full swing as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction.Roscow, p. 196 Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total.Roscow, p. 197 On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.Facts, p. 77 Additional tasks remained still to be completed, but the pipeline could be put into operation without them. The E. L. Patton Yukon River Bridge was not completed until October 1979;Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. \\"Yukon River\\" , Alyeska- pipe.com. Accessed July 23, 2009. until then, traffic utilized a series of ferries across the river. Additional pump stations also were constructed between 1977 and 1980, as oil flow increased.Facts, p. 47  Camp cleanup  As part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, Alyeska was required to remove most traces of the 31 pipeline construction camps. Seven camps closed in November 1976, and six more closed before the 1977 construction season started.Roscow, p. 198 All told, 20 camps went up for sale. One was sold to the University of Alaska for use as an Arctic research facility,University of Alaska Fairbanks. \\"Toolik Field Station\\", UAF.edu. Accessed July 30, 2009. while another was converted for use as a truck stop and motel.Coldfoot Camp. \\"History\\" , Coldfootcamp.com. Accessed July 30, 2009. In addition to removing its camps, Alyeska also had to dispose of the heavy equipment used to build the pipeline. In January 1977, Alyeska listed more than 20,000 pieces of equipment for sale. The New York Times called the auction of surplus equipment \\"one of the biggest going-out-of-business sales in history.\\"  Turning on TAPS  In April 1977, Alyeska filed a notice that it intended to start filling the pipeline sometime between June 20 and July 1. Engineers had to face several problems when filling the pipeline. First was the need to balance temperatures: Filled by air, the steel pipeline was about degrees. The oil emerging from wells at Prudhoe Bay was more than degrees, and there was a danger that if it was introduced before intermediate warming, the pipeline could crack because of thermal expansion.Roscow, p. 199 The second problem came when the pipeline needed to be purged of air in order to reduce the danger of fire or explosion. Usually, a pipeline is filled with water first, and the oil pushes the water ahead of it, purging the pipeline as it goes. In Alaska, there was a fear that the water would freeze in the pipeline, damaging it. This problem was solved when pressurized nitrogen was used instead of water. On June 20, 1977, the first section of pipeline was pressurized with nitrogen, and oil was introduced behind it. Because of the cold temperature of the pipeline and the slow rate at which oil was introduced, it took 31 days for the first oil to travel from Prudhoe to Valdez. \\"As oil cools down, it becomes thicker,\\" explained one worker. \\"Our oil at first had a viscosity very similar to asphalt.Roscow, p. 200 Another problem was faced when the oil traveled downslope from Atigun Pass. To avoid a situation where the oil front could gain momentum from the downhill slope and rapidly crash into a pipeline section or pump and damage it, regulator valves were used to slow the rate at which the nitrogen ahead of the oil could move. This procedure was used at the other downhill slopes at startup. As the oil advanced through the pipeline, it was paced by a series of inspectors who traveled along the pipeline route to ensure the weight of the oil did not cause the pipeline to settle or create problems on bridges as the unbalanced weight of the oil front passed over them. This first inspection crew was followed by a second, and others patrolled the pipeline regularly as the oil front passed down the line.Roscow, p. 202 The first oil arrived in Valdez on July 28, 1977, at 11:02 p.m. The oil was only , but it gradually warmed as the system reached a thermal equilibrium. After the initial startup, the pipeline was intended to run continuously. Said an engineer: \\"We start up this pipeline once ... It will stay onstream then forever ... 'forever' being the life of the oil field.\\" The startup was not without incident. On July 4, a nitrogen leak was detected at milepost 489.2. The flow of oil stopped for three days as workers repaired a pipe elbow that cracked because of the temperature difference between the pipe and the supercooled nitrogen. On July 8, oil flowed through a shut-off pump at Pump Station 8 as workers replaced a strainer. The resulting spray mixed with ambient air and was ignited by a stray spark. One worker was killed and five others were injured in the resulting explosion, which also shut down the station until March 1978.Facts, p. 78Roscow, p. 203 On July 19, a heavy equipment accident caused a pipeline break that leaked of oil. The startup process and construction as a whole came to an end on August 1, 1977 when the tanker ARCO Juneau sailed out of Valdez with the first load of oil from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.Roscow, p. 204  Cost  When the TAPS group initially proposed the pipeline in 1969, the proposed cost was $900 million, and the pipeline would be completed by 1972.Mead, p. 117 By January 1970, the projected cost had risen from $900 million to $2 billion.Mead, p. 156 In October 1973, Alyeska further refined its figures and anticipated a cost of between $3.1 billion and $3.5 billion, with the potential for a billion more. One year later, Alyeska released its most detailed cost estimate to that point: $5.982 billion.Mead, p. 210 By June 1975, that figure had again risen to $6.4 billion. At the time, it was estimated that $3 billion of the cost rise to that point was due to inflation, while another $2 billion was due to environmental costs.Roscow, pp. 147-148 In July 1976, amid the second year of construction, the project's cost was raised to $7.7 billion. The increase, Alyeska reported, was due to material and freight costs, repairs needed to poorly built sections of pipeline, and contingency estimates. The final construction cost was tallied at $8 billion, but this figure does not include interest on investment loans or the cost of improvements and repairs after 1977.Facts, p. 15 The Valdez Marine Terminal alone cost $1.4 billion.Facts, p. 66 The percentage of the pipeline owned by various companies has changed over time, but as of 2009, the primary owner was BP, which controls 46.93 percent of the pipeline. Second is ConocoPhillips Transportation Alaska Inc. with 28.29 percent, followed in order by ExxonMobil (20.34 percent), Koch Alaska Pipeline Company (3.08 percent), and Unocal Pipeline Company (1.36 percent).Joint Pipeline Office. \\"TAPS ownership\\" , jpo.doi.gov. Accessed July 30, 2009. The pipeline also has had a human toll. Thirty-two Alyeska or contract workers were killed during the construction project.Facts, p. 25 That figure does not include common carrier fatalities. Since the pipeline began operating in 1977, 10 people have been killed while working for Alyeska or one of its contractors.  Notes   References  *Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.

Studio Albums Ghawas recorded and released his debut EP, \\"Hums\\", in 2007 during his time in Boston as a Fulbright Scholar. The release was received positively by the Bahraini media upon his return and then followed by another two critically acclaimed EPs, \\"Whispers\\" in 2008 and \\"Screams\\" in 2009. Starting 2011, Ghawas spent almost three years writing new songs for his debut LP, \\"Armor\\", and partnered with the Bahraini band, ‚ÄòLikwid‚Äô, for the recording of these songs. The album was released in November 2013 and featured his most popular single to date, \\"Elsewhere\\". After the release of Armor, the partnership between Ala Ghawas and Likwid took more adventurous grounds with a series of live performances to promote the album in Bahrain, Dubai and Cairo. Ghawas' 5th studio album is entitled \\"Tryst\\" and it was released in November 2017. The album was written and produced by Ghawas himself and partnered with Bahraini sound engineer Abdulla Jamal for recording/mixing the album and Bahraini composer Mohammed Haddad for arranging the strings sections. Ghawas had also collaborated with Bahraini artist Abbas Almosawi to paint the cover artwork of the album. Live Albums After a series of performances in music festivals following his first three EPs, on 19 November 2009, Ghawas performed his first solo show at the prestigious concert hall of Shaikh Ebrahim Center in Muharraq. The recordings from the concert were released digitally later in 2011 on iTunes as a live album entitled \\"Live from Muharraq\\" and it contains live renditions from Hums, Whispers and Screams along with Elliott Smith's cover \\"Between the Bars\\" and Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\". Later in 2015, Ghawas invited Likwid to record and film a live concert and a documentary at his house and called it \\"Ala Ghawas & Likwid: Live from Allston\\". Ghawas named his house \\"Allston\\" honoring the small town in the city of Boston where he used to live in 2006 and 2007. The film was produced and directed by Bahraini filmmaker 'Saleh Nass'. In 2019, Ghawas filmed and recorded his third live album entitled \\"Live from Grace\\" and it featured performances from his friends and frequent collaborators Ahmed Alqasim, Fawaz Alshaikh, Ali Alqaseer, Abdulla Haji, Isa Najem, Eman Haddad and Hassan Haddad. The album contained 12 original renditions of songs written by Ala Ghawas from his previous studio releases.

A preparatory meeting, which would lead to the formation of BPP, was held on February 27, 1951. The BPP was officially launched on March 31, 1951, and a Common Programme adopted. The BPP Common Programme was broadly nationalist. It called for an independent Indonesian foreign policy, and a break from the Round Table Conference agreement. Moreover, it called for the lifting of the state of War, nationalization of key industries, release of political prisoners, land reform, the right to strike, swift holding of elections and the return of West Irian (West Papua) to Indonesia.Feith, Herbert.

Initially it appeared that the BPP would provide a venue for the Communist Party of Indonesia broad cooperation with the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI). However, as the PNI eventually rejected the invitation to join the BPP, the coalition rapidly became non-effective.

Rendered obsolete by the mechanical drainage improvements after World War II, it was finally removed in 1991. It carried water, under gravity, from Bourne South Fen, Thurlby Fen and Northorpe Fen to the Counter Drain and thence to Deeping Fen. A tunnel was required under the River Glen which was (and still is) artificially banked with a level some 3 metres above the surrounding lands and above the Counter Drain. The Counter Drain was pumped further downstream by wind-driven machinery, erected later. Published at opening of new Tongue End pumping station. At the time of construction Deeping Fen was still inundated. In 1871 the Bourne South Fen Drainage District was formed to take over the drainage, which had been in the hands of adventurers, and from 1872 a succession of steam engines were used to assist the flow through the tunnel. The location is around 500m upstream on the Glen of the confluence with the Bourne Eau. Tongue End is the nearest settlement. The modern by-road alongside the original drain to the tunnel is still called Tunnel Bank. The Gilbert Heathcote for whom it is named appears to be the father of Sir Gilbert Heathcote, 1st Baronet, and an ancestor of the first Baron Aveland.

A level is completed when a specific number of tiles have been changed in this way.  Gameplay  The player controls a ball which can move in the four cardinal directions and also jump. Jumping is necessary to traverse gaps between tiles and evade enemies. There are six kinds of target tile (shown at top of screen) but not all of them feature in every level. There is a quota for the exact number of tiles of each type that must be touched; if this is exceeded the level cannot be completed. Certain tiles operate as switches; touching them will change the arrangement of tiles on the screen. Certain exits are only revealed when the nearest tile is touched. Various enemies will try to kill the player; they must be evaded or jumped over. Falling off the map is also fatal. There is also a time limit.

The album was released in the UK in 1979. With the exception of \\"I'm the Greatest\\", a Ringo Starr album track written for him by John Lennon in 1973, all songs were recorded and released as singles during the active Beatles years in the 1960s.

There were broadly three categories of Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songs that were not released by the Beatles: *Recordings by the Beatles of Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songs that the group ultimately decided not to release. *Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songs that the Beatles deemed unsuitable for the group at the outset and did not even attempt to record themselves. *Songs that had been intentionally written for other artists. In the earliest days of their songwriting partnership, Lennon and McCartney expressed a desire to emulate the success of composing duos such as Goffin & King and Leiber & Stoller in having their compositions recorded by other artists, so this was an aspect of the songwriting craft that they were interested in pursuing. With the encouragement of the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein, they supplied some of their songs deemed unsuitable for the Beatles to fellow artists, several of whom were also managed by Epstein and were friends with Lennon and McCartney. Once the Beatles' initial success in early-mid 1963 mushroomed into a phenomenon, there was great interest in songs written by the Beatles \\"in- house\\" writing duo. Artists began clamouring to secure original Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songs knowing that there would automatically be media and public interest in such songs. The quality of the songs and the subsequent commercial success of such songs added to the demand by artists for even more compositions.

The bridge links Teesdale Business Park and the University of Durham, Queen's Campus in Thornaby-on-Tees to the Castlegate (shopping) Centre in Stockton-on-Tees High Street. The bridge crosses the Teesdale Way cycle route, River Tees and the A1035 Riverside Road. Funding for the bridge was from Stockton-on-Tees Council, the European Regional Development Fund, One NorthEast and English Partnerships. Teesquay Millennium Footbridge is also referred to as the Millennium Bridge.  Design  Stockton Borough Council provided a brief for a 'design and build' competition to construct a pedestrian bridge across the River Tees. The 'design and build' competition was won by a team comprising Ove Arup and Birse Construction. Their entry was the only one to satisfy the local council's strictly limited budget. The bridge has a cable-stayed design with architecture by Yee Associates and designed by Ove Arup whereas the identification signage on the bridge states that it was designed by the constructor, Birse Construction. It has a 'A' frame pylon/mast with fanned cables and has a total span of . The walkway is wide narrowing to on the extension over Riverside Road to the Castlegate Centre.  Construction  The bridge was fabricated in Spain, constructed on site by Birse Construction North East and completed in December 2000 at a cost of ¬£1.4m.  Operation  The bridge was opened on 20 December 2000 by Dari Taylor, Member of Parliament for Stockton South, and the mayor of Stockton-on-Tees. The Teesgate Millennium Footbridge was one of the few number of millennium footbridges to be actually completed in the millennium year, but unlike some high-profile millennium footbridges it was not funded by the Millennium Commission. The bridge has been criticised for both wobbling and being too narrow to accommodate cyclists who are required to dismount and are barred from entering the Castlegate Centre in any case.

The first- person narrator, Eddie Harnovey, is a chemical engineer, married to Tanya, an aspiring but ultimately uncontracted political science academic. Eddie is from middle class origins, his father being a clerk for a local council. His childhood friend Amanda, however, was a class above them. As a chemical engineer, her father wore starched cotton shirts while Eddie's father wore drip-dry poly-cotton shirts. Amanda's family banned Eddie from meeting her. Nevertheless, Eddie meets Amanda every nine and half years. The next time is as undergraduates, where Eddie notices her in a queue for more fashionable food than he is in the queue for. The next time is as fellow shoppers in a department store, as Eddie looks for formal wear for his marriage to Tanya. The next time he meets her is in much straitened circumstances. Downsized, jobless, and with only three dollars in his bank account, Eddie skips an appointment with Amanda - now an employment consultant - and ends up beaten unconscious protecting a friend of a now indigent man Eddie befriended while still solvent. Eddie's report on Amanda's father's smelter expansion was the reason Eddie was downsized. Amanda identifies Eddie from the appointment card he had in his shirt pocket.

Background and result of destruction from the fire The fires of 2009 began on the night of August 21, 2009 and burned over the next four days, covering approximately 21,000 hectares of pine forest, olive groves, shrub land and farmland. The fires affected 15 municipalities and communities and destroyed 60 homes, damaging another 150. The fires began in Grammatiko village, about 40 km north-east of Athens, and spread to the mountains of eastern Attica. Around 72 houses were damaged in Grammatiko and other badly hit communities were Stamata and Rodopoli. More than 1,000 fire-fighters and soldiers were placed on duty over the weekend, and a total of 19 planes and helicopters worked to fight the fires, dropping around 14,000 tonnes of water on one day alone (24 August 2009). Aircraft were drafted-in from Italy, France and Cyprus. The cost of hiring the fire services 14 helicopters for about 120 flying hours is estimated at 30 million euros. According to World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Greece, The destruction from three days of intense forest fires ‚Äúconfirms the inability of the state to effectively manage the country‚Äôs forests‚Äù.Athens News, Friday, 28 August 2009, reported by Damian Mac Con Uladh Unlike the 2007 Greek forest fires, the 2009 fires took place in eastern Attica, which is a forested-suburban region known for its illegal ribbon development, where thousands of illegal homes have been legalised ahead of successive elections by incumbent governments. This area is also expected to undergo further development and population increase as a result of new urban plans for the area. Gavril Xanthopoulos, a scientist at the Greek Forest Research Institute in Athens, and one of the country‚Äôs leading forest fire experts is quoted as saying: ‚ÄúThese areas are what we call a wildland-urban interface, which are not just peculiar to Greece, but exist in all European Mediterranean countries‚Äù. The mix of homes and forest can drain fire resources, because the fight is targeted at burning homes and property, allowing forest fires to spread faster. Xanthopoulos claims to have alerted civil protection authorities a fortnight before the fires warning that the drought in vegetation had reached the levels of 2007, that there was an extreme likelihood of fires occurring and that this was reflected in the area‚Äôs fire danger map. The meltemi winds, typical of this time of year made the fires head south, which was a predictable trajectory for the fire. S-64E Erickson Air-Crane helicopter at Ioannina airport, Greece WWF has called for radical reform of the fire service, which has been weakened, since 1981, by political interference in recruitment and promotion, bureaucratisation, the removal of fire-fighting responsibilities from the forestry service and abolition of the dasokommando, which is a Greek specialised fire-fighting unit. According to Konstantinos Liarikos, environmental programme director of WWF, part of the existing fire service needs to be especially dedicated to forest fire-fighting, and emphasis should be on suppression rather than prevention: the cost of hiring an Erickson Air-Crane Helitanker fire-fighting helicopter is 800,000 euros a season, and is equivalent to the cost of hiring 800 seasonal fire-fighters, which WWF claims would be more effective. In addition, citizen awareness programmes are needed to educated suburban residents about fire prevention and fire-fighting. For example, the connection of electric pumps to swimming pools to help residents to use water for dousing fires. Planting fire-resistant tree species in gardens, such as bay laurel, poplar, acacia and oak, can also help save homes. In 2007, fires spread more slowly in rural areas of the Peloponnese where a farming population kept areas well-managed and clear of grass. Factors contributing to the fires *Forestry registry: Although an official forestry registry has been prepared, there is no political agreement on the contours of the state forests. Implementation has also been delayed until the Greek environment ministry has passed its spatial plan for Athens. Without a registry, municipalities are unable to identify land use changes and illegal house-building. *1997: The dasokommandos are disbanded. *1998: The forestry service loses control of forest fire-fighting, which is assumed by the fire service. This separates forest management from forest fire-fighting. *2003: Legislation, known as Law 3208/2003, changes the definition of what constitutes a forest and suspends penalties for construction within forests and their arbitrary destruction: fires rarely seem to occur on land with no real estate value. *Fire prevention: The government spends approximately ten times more on fire suppression than fire prevention. Money goes to local authorities and is not accounted for. *Resources: Greece has the same number of fire-fighting planes in 2009 as it did in 2007, with only around 10 Canadair water-bombing planes. *Depleted fire and forestry services: 3,000 permanent vacancies remain to be filled in the fire service, leaving the service under-staffed. The forestry service remains ‚Äúdecimated by staff shortages‚Äù (WWF) and needs 30% more forestry scientists, 70% more forestry technicians, and 55% more forestry rangers. *Civil protection system: This is almost non-existent, and voluntary forces are not used effectively. *Co-ordination: Co-operation between branches of the fire, forestry and civil protection services remain fragmented and there is no umbrella framework for strategic co-operation and planning. *Priority: Fire protection does not appear to be a national priority for the government, which has focused attention on economic issues, such as the budget deficit. Effect on wildlife About half the burnt woodlands should be able to recover because they are mature pine forests. The other half, are low in regenerative capacity due to repeated burning. Countless animals have perished in the fires, tortoises being the most easily visible, due to their burnt-out shells. Birds and faster-moving animals can flee, but will now over-burden nearby eco-systems. Surviving animals may suffer from burns and smoke inhalation. Re-colonisation of burnt areas will be slow, commencing with insects, lizards and birds, with hares, partridges and foxes only arriving after the first rain has led to new growth. Lack of forest cover will make it easier for predators to locate certain prey species. The Association for the Protection and Welfare of Wildlife (Anima) operate a 24-hour call centre at telephone: 210-951-0075 or 6972 664 675 (www.wild-anima.gr) for animal casualties. Effect on cultural heritage The antiquities linked to the battle of Marathon were not directly damaged, although the physical setting of the sites has been destroyed. The sites include the Marathon battle site, Tomb of the Marathon Warriors, the Marathon Museum, Tomb of the Plataeans, and Ramnous. The sites were saved, due to the fight of local residents during the night of 23‚Äì24 August, and the assistance of a northerly wind that helped contain the fires and avoid catastrophe to the ancient monuments and ecologically important area of Schinias. Marathon residents had already been fighting the construction of a land-fill site outside Grammatiko.Athens News, Friday, 28 August 2009, \\"The unsung battle of Marathon\\", by Dimitri Yannopoulos Attica fires chronology *1981: Kifisia, 612 hectares *1982, Dionysos, 1,360 hectares * 1986: Varibombi, 500 hectares *1992: Avlona, 6,700 hectares * 1993, Pendeli, 5,700 hectares * 2005: Raphina, 1,100 hectares *2007: Parnitha, 5,000 hectares Aftermath Since the fires some areas, for example, around Lake Marathon, have been reported as being subject to grazing by flocks of goats. The goats are wandering freely over the burnt-out forest areas. Grazing goats is forbidden in Attica under a law of 1993. After the fires of August 2009, the grazing of other types of animals in forest areas, such as sheep and cattle, was also forbidden. The burnt areas of forest appear to be unmonitored by forest patrols. There are only 49 forest guards in Attica, which means that each guard must patrol an area of 83,000 stremmata. A modern stremma is approximately 1,000 square metres and thus .1 hectares or .247 acres. The total forested extent of Attica is 3,500,000 stremmata. In some areas, olive trees have been planted within the burnt forest areas. This is one of the first illegal steps in transforming unmonitored forested areas into cultivated land. Mr Nikos Chlikas, a forester and environmentalist, has emphasised that about 90,000 to 100,000 stremmata in north-east Attica have been burnt for a second or third time, out of the total of 210,000 stremmata, which was burnt in August 2009. In these areas, it is essential that there is intervention by the authorities to help forest regeneration because the pine trees are very young and do not have the capacity to create cones. This forest cannot regenerate by itself. In addition, the number of small trees which are, at the moment, in the nursery at Amigdales will have difficulty covering 3,000-4,000 stremmata, for this reason money needs to be allocated for new trees, so that planting can take place over the next few years. According to Nikos Chlikas, the cost of reforestation is around 500 euro for each stremma, including the cost of caring for the trees for at least two years. However, in 2008 less than 10,000 stremmata were reforested in the whole of Greece. As part of the post-fire protection work, the Geotechnical Chamber of Greece (Œ§Œø ŒìŒµœâœÑŒµœáŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒïœÄŒπŒºŒµŒªŒ∑œÑŒÆœÅŒπŒø ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±œÇ (ŒìŒïŒ©Œ§.Œï.Œï.)) with the aim of taking measures to protect the area have placed logs and matted branches along the ground in burnt forest areas, in order to slow down runoff and so reduce erosion. In some areas, cement dams have been constructed at some points, although experts question the logic of this, and claim that it is an excessive intervention into the environment. In the secondary and tertiary burnt areas there are, however, insufficient logs of the right size for creating barriers to run-off erosion. Mr Antonis Angelopoulos, a geologist and vice-president of the Geotechnical Chamber of Greece, Eastern Mainland Greece section, agrees that some of the interventions into the environment have been excessive. For example, in Agia Varvara, the permanent cement structures that have been made were probably unnecessary, because the area has already got at least two old, stone dams, which could have been recycled. However, on the gulley of Agiou Stefanou, the anti-runoff work has been positive, because dams have been constructed from boxes made out of wire. This is friendlier to the environment, because these dams hold back rain-washed matter, but allow water to pass through. Proposed legislation The new Minister for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change, Tina Birbili, has created a new draft bill which was announced on 27 October 2009. This legislation would suspend all construction activity on burned forestland in Attica and other parts of Greece until authorities draw up comprehensive forest maps. The ban will be imposed on the issuing of construction licences except for the repair of homes and public buildings destroyed in the fires. The Hellenic Mapping and Cadastral Organization (HEMCO), established in 1986, will soon start operating a sophisticated system of forest land on the outskirts of Attica, with the aim of reporting back to the authorities the appearance of every new structure outside the town plan. The bill is to be submitted to the Greek Parliament in the first week of November 2009 and provides for the creation of a special state agency which will demolish illegally built homes on burned forest land and fine offenders. The ministry‚Äôs environmental inspectors would have the responsibility of locating and demolishing illegal constructions. The 2003 reform introduced by the former Agriculture Minister Giorgos Drys, under the Panhellenic Socialist Movement's previous administration, which required at least one-quarter of a piece of land must be covered by forest for it to qualify as forest land. The new bill will reinstate the original 15% requirement.

Nicknamed \\"De Knoest\\" (\\"The Burl\\"), Tol played as a striker and was the top goalscorer in the Eredivisie in the 1961‚Äì62 season, scoring 27 goals. He is also the all-time top goalscorer of Volendam.  Career  Born in Volendam as the son of well- to-do fishmonger, Kees Tol, Dick Tol began playing for FC Volendam after World War II. He was not a technical gifted player, but mainly relied on his explosiveness and physical strength. He was nicknamed \\"De Knoest\\" (\\"The Burl\\"), an honorary title his grandfather once earned after he saved his boat as a captain during a storm by scooping the boat empty with a bucket for eight hours in a row. De Knoest therefore refers to the primal power of the fisherman, a symbol of the town of Volendam. Despite Tol being a renowned goalscorer as a youth player, exemplified by scoring 12 goals in a whopping 48-0 win over RKEDO from De Goorn, he only made his debut in the first-team of Volendam at age 21 under head coach Leen van Woerkom. In his first season in the top-tier Eerste Klasse, he scored thirty goals. A season later, in the newly established Eerste Divisie, he hit the target 36 times, making him the top goalscorer of the competition. In the 1958‚Äì59 season, Volendam was promoted to the Eredivisie, only to suffer relegation again a year later. A second promotion followed a year later. Tol became the top goalscorer of the Eredivisie in the 1961‚Äì62 season with 27 goals, despite missing nine matches that season due to an injury. His team finished seventh that year. The striker's good performances led to his first call-up to the Netherlands national team, who played against Denmark on 26 September 1962. Three days before the international fixture, Tol suffered a sprained ankle in a duel with Guus Haak from ADO, which forced him to cancel. For Tol, this remained his only call up for the national team. He did appear for the Netherlands national B team several times and after his career he played for a team of former internationals. After three years playing in the Eredivisie, Tol and Volendam relegated back to the Eerste Divisie in 1964. In the 1966‚Äì67 season, Tol became the top goalscorer of the second-tier for the second time in his career with 32 goals. Volendam won the championship and promoted, but Tol decided to retire from football. He made a total of 276 league goals during his career which meant that he scored in 83% of his appearances, making him the club topscorer of Volendam. In the Eredivisie, he scored 76 goals in 101 appearances. Later life and death After his playing career, Tol coached amateur club OSV from Oostzaan. Later, he was a coordinator of the FC Volendam coaches as well as a youth coach at the club. He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 1973, and died at the age of 39 in the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis hospital in Amsterdam due to complications shortly after receiving colon surgery.

Education Lewin attended University of Oxford at The Queens College on an academic scholarship in 1932, having earned both the Hastings Scholar award and the Goldsmiths‚Äô Exhibitioner award in Classics and Divinity. While there he earned double First honours in classical literature, history and philosophy. His love of English literature endured throughout his life. Career Following his graduation in 1937 Lewin worked as an editorial assistant with the British publishing house of Jonathan Cape Limited. With the start of the Second World War in 1939 he joined the British Army, serving as an officer in the Royal Artillery. In North Africa he served under Montgomery, and was wounded at El Alamein. He returned to his field post and served with distinction in North Africa and Europe till the close of the war. Returning to England in 1946 he worked in the BBC Home service, initially as a producer. He was made chief of the BBC's domestic service in 1957, and remained at that position until his retirement from the BBC in 1965. In 1966 he returned to publishing, and was made editor at Hutchinson Publishing. He served in that capacity till 1969. Military historian Lewin did not begin writing books until the age of 54. He wrote nine books during his lifetime and was working on a one-volume history of World War II at the time of his death. His best- known book was Ultra Goes to War, an account written on the cipher breaking by which the Allies intercepted and broke the coded messages that the Germans transmitted by radio during World War II. His work on Ultra was the first to be based on official documents of the intelligence operation. Writing in a foreword to a book by Lewin, historian Max Hastings said \\"He quickly established a reputation as one of the major military writers of his generation.\\" He went on to say \\"His biography of Slim was outstanding. His assessments of Churchill, Montgomery and Rommel at war are essential reading for students of the period.\\" Lewin's biography of William Slim, titled Slim the Standard-Bearer, received the WH Smith Literary Award. In his reassessment of Rommel, University of Salford's Alaric Searle grouped Lewin's biography of Rommel with those of other former serving officers Desmond Young, Martin Blumenson, Kenneth Macksey, David Fraser and several others, whose work he dismissed as \\"effusive and often uncritical\\". Searle asserted these works were part of a group of writings that created a Rommel legend, a view that the Field Marshal was an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of the Third Reich due to his presumed participation in the 20 July plot to kill Adolf Hitler. Historian Patrick Major states that Lewin's biography of Rommel focused on his military career, presenting him strictly as a soldier. Awards Lewin was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1977 and of the Royal Historical Society in 1980. He was awarded the Chesney Gold Medal of the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in 1982.

The electors are the 52 MPs and the six heads of provincial governments; ten signatures of support are required for nomination. Outgoing president Kalkot Mataskelekele was renominated for a second term, but Iolu Abil ultimately succeeded in winning a five-year term after three rounds of voting by the electoral college. Election background Kalkot Mataskelekele's five-year term as President of Vanuatu ended on August 16, 2009. The Speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman was sworn in as acting President until Mataskelekele's successor could be elected. Under the Constitution, the President of Vanuatu is elected by the 58 member electoral college, which is composed of the 52 members of Parliament as well as the six heads of each of the provincial governments of Vanuatu (Malampa, Penama, Sanma, Shefa, Tafea and Torba). A presidential candidate must win two-thirds of the electoral college in order to be elected president. According to the Constitution, the presidential election must be held within three weeks after the previous office holder's term expires. The government of Vanuatu allocated approximately US$70,000 to cover the costs of the 2009 presidential election. Candidates Fifteen candidates seeking the presidency submitted their names to the electoral office ‚Äì two women and thirteen men. However, only eleven candidates were ultimately found to be eligible to stand for election. The eleven eligible candidates for President were: *Iolu Abil *Vincent Boulekone *Leas Manu Cullwick *Enias LiatlatmalFormer President Kalkot Mataskelekele was nominated for a second term *David Lovis *Kalkot Mataskelekele *Kalo Nial *Yvette Sam *Luke Siba *Belton Seth *Jacques Sese Election Eleven candidates, including two women, stood in the first round of the election on 1 September 2009 (fifteen had filed, but four of them were not eligible to stand). Vincent Boulekone won 16 votes, Mataskelekele won 14 votes and Iolu Abil won 11 votes. Kalo Nial and female candidate Yvette Sam both won seven votes. As 39 votes were required to be elected, a second round was set for 2 September 2009. The government claimed that its votes had been split between various candidates as the government had decided to allow individual MPs to decide whom to vote for in the first round, so that respect could be shown to previous leaders. The second round was also inconclusive, but in the third round (also on 2 September), Iolu Abil was elected with 41 votes. There were only six other candidates remaining in the third round. Abil was supported by the government (he was the PM's preference, while the deputy Prime Minister Ham Lini would have preferred to reelect Mataskelekele).

Her arrest in 1677 marked the opening of the official investigation. She appealed to Fran√ßois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois claiming that she had information about other crimes of high importance. Louvois reported to the King, who told Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, who, among other things, was the chief of the Paris police, to root out the poisoners. Magdelaine de La Grange worked as a fortune teller after the execution of her husband for receiving stolen goods. Her specialty was to reveal to clients who were worried about their health that they had been poisoned, and offer them antidotes. Since 1669, she lived in luxury at the expense of the rich lawyer Jean Faurye. On 17 August 1676, Magdelaine de La Grange and a man who introduced himself as Faurye appeared before a law clerk. The man said that they were married, and had a will issued to the benefit of his spouse, Magdelaine de La Grange. Shortly after, Jean Faurye died, and his family reported the matter. The marriage certificate proved to be a forgery issued by Abb√© Nail, who had appeared as Faurye at the law clerk's office. After having established a link between her and Louis de Vanens, the case convinced Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie that there existed a network of poisoners in Paris, and de La Grange and Nial were kept without trial for months for questioning. She never revealed anything of real importance, however, and after the arrest of Marie Bosse in 1679, the trial against her was allowed to proceed. Magdelaine de La Grange and Abb√© Nail were sentenced to death for forgery and murder on 4 February 1679, and four days later they were hanged.

Romani was described as a person credited with great abilities in disguise and persuasion. He was the intended son-in-law of Catherine Monvoisin, who had him engaged to her daughter Marguerite Monvoisin. He did, however, break the engagement after it became known to him that she had been pregnant by another man shortly before their engagement. He was accused of having conspired with his lover Catherine Monvoisin to assassinate Ang√©lique de Fontanges with poisoned gloves, while he was valet-de-chambre to a lady of the court. It was further claimed that he planned to assassinate Louis XIV by handing him a petition impregnated with poison. He was pointed out for his participation in this affair by Marguerite Monvoisin, who described him as a poisoner and a master of disguises. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and sequestration in 1682. The date of his death is not known. He was chained to the wall during his imprisonment, and he is last mentioned in 1714, when one of his fellow prisoners removed his chaines out of pity, and was punished for this act.

Early career Uecker studied with Sanford Meisner, Mira Rostova, and Kim Stanley. He also was an assistant to Harold Clurman at the Actors Studio in the Playwrights and Directors Unit. His associations with the Actors Studio and Meisner led to roles in several plays directed by Method and Meisner teachers, including William Alderson and William Esper. He made his Broadway debut in The November People in 1978 Internet Broadway Database and began working in downtown New York City. During this time, he briefly lived with Candy Darling and started to work with James Purdy. Tennessee Williams Tennessee Williams attended a workshop of several James Purdy stories adapted by Uecker and hired him as a general assistant and intermittent editor. Uecker assisted Williams in the writing of many of his later one-act plays, including The Chalky White Substance, which was dedicated to Purdy. Uecker later directed the premiere of The Chalky White Substance, pairing the short play with The Travelling Companion under the collective title Williams Guignol.Sam Whitehead, \\"Williams Guignol,\\" Time Out NY, March 15‚Äì22, 1996 Uecker was sleeping in the adjoining room on the night that Williams died. > Mr. Williams's body was found Friday morning by his secretary, John Uecker, > who shared the playwright's two-room suite. Mr. Uecker said he had heard a > noise in Mr. Williams's room at about 11 P.M on Thursday, but did not > investigate. At about 10:45 A.M. Friday, Mr. Uecker entered the room and > found Mr. Williams lying next to his bed. Williams' sudden death has continued to haunt Uecker, who has faced accusations of negligence and even murder. Speaking to CBS New York, on the 30th anniversary of the playwright's death, CUNY Professor Annette J. Saddik said Williams had been taking Seconal ‚Äì a barbiturate derivative ‚Äì to help him sleep, and also had been drinking the night he died. > ‚ÄúWhen this happened, John Uecker, who was his companion and assistant at the > time, was still around and told the (New York City) Medical Examiner, ‚ÄòLook, > people are going to think it‚Äôs suicide or AIDS or something bizarre and we > don‚Äôt know what happened,‚Äô‚Äù Saddik said in the interview. ‚ÄúSo the Medical > Examiner, said, ‚ÄòOK, he choked on a bottle cap.‚Äô But really, his body just > gave up and the eventual diagnosis was intolerance.‚Äù Uecker was hired by the Executors of the Williams' Estate (Southeast Banking Corporation and John Eastman), for the purpose of cataloguing, authenticating and preserving Mr. Williams' later work because of Uecker's extensive and first-hand knowledge of the genesis of Mr. Williams' later manuscripts. In 2010, Uecker spoke at the grand opening of the newly renovated Tennessee Williams Welcome Center in downtown Columbus, Mississippi. James Purdy After Williams died, Uecker became more involved as general and literary assistant to James Purdy. Uecker had already been adapting and acting in Purdy's short pieces. From the late 1980s, he began directing Purdy's plays produced by Victoria Linchong. Their first collaboration was on the production of two of Purdy's short plays Heatstroke and Souvenir under the collective title Sun of the Sleepless, featuring Laurence Fishburne and Sheila Dabney.Michael Feingold, ‚ÄúWaking Dreams,‚Äù The Village Voice, April 4, 1989, 81-82 Other credits include the full-length plays The Rivalry of Dolls and Foment. Uecker and Linchong later founded a theater company to produce the work of Purdy. Uecker collaborated with Purdy on a large-scale, substantive edit of \\"Gertrude of Stony Island Avenue\\". Uecker also was associated with the creative development and substantive editing of the last two publications of Purdy's lifetime, \\"Moe's Villa and Other Stories\\", a collection of 13 Purdy short-stories, and \\"Selected Plays\\", a collection of 4 full-length plays for which Uecker wrote the introduction. The relationship with Purdy produced 9 full-length plays, 30 short plays, as well as a novel and a book of short stories. Uecker brought the mainstream press' attention back to Purdy by helping to land a lifetime retrospective review of Purdy's work in the New York Times Book Review. The result was a long essay by Gore Vidal, who framed Purdy's as \\"the outlaw of American fiction\\" and praised him as \\"an authentic American genius.\\" Other work For eight years in New York City, Uecker taught a fusion of the Meisner technique and Method acting, which had been synthesized in exercises developed and taught by the actress Kim Stanley. Uecker coached and/or directed James Gandolfini, Holly Hunter, Brett Butler Laurence Fishburne, Melissa Gilbert, Sam Trammell, and Jason Hale.

Career In 1925, she became a teacher in elementary schools in impoverished mining areas of Nottinghamshire. Her first novel, War On Saturday Week, dealt with political extremism in Britain during the years leading up to the Second World War. Her second novel, I'm Not Complaining (1938), depicted women's lives in the Depression from the point of view of an unmarried female teacher. She worked for the Ministry of Information during the Second World War, and wrote radio scripts, including some for Woman's Hour, which started on BBC radio in 1946. From 1944 to 1976 she wrote the women's page for the Church of England Newspaper, which expressed her position as a Christian socialist feminist. One such article, \\"Comics and Shockers\\" in 1948, put her on the same page as Marcus Morris, whose religious ideals and concerns about the influence of American comics led him to launch Eagle in 1950, and Girl the following year. Adam wrote strips for Girl, in which she attempted to counteract the passiveness of many girls' heroines by introducing young female characters who were resourceful, brave and clever.

Solenochilus is derived from the Upper Mississippian Acanthonautilus, principally through evolutionary changes in the siphuncle. The siphuncle in both Solenochilus and Acanthonautilus is ventral, running just inside the outer rim of the shell. In both the siphuncle is mostly composed of thin connecting rings. The siphuncle in Solenochilus is wider and has a more sinuous profile than that of Acanthonautilus. Both swing dorsally between septa, but more so in Solenochilus. In both the septal necks are somewhat long and straight on the ventral side but in Solenochilus they are cyrtochoanitic and recumbent on the dorsal side, rather than simply curved back, cyrtochoanitic. Solenochilus resembles its predecessor, Acanthonautilus', in overall anatomy, and both genera superficially resemble Permonautilus from the Clydonautilaceae.

It is based on the television show of the same name. Plot Megabyte has found a way to use the power of energy tears to reach the core of the principle office thanks to Hexadecimal's mirrors and is determined to take over Mainframe. Bob, the game's lead character, must mend tears and destroy deadly adversaries in the six sectors of Mainframe: Baudway, Cit E (also known as Wall Street), Beverly Hills, Kits, Floating Point Park and G-Prime along with the island of Lost Angles. Gameplay The player controls Bob, who starts with an ordinary pistol. Weapons that are more powerful can be obtained as the player progresses through the game. Bob can use a variety of keytools to either mend a tear or defeat an enemy. Keytool abilities include stealing health from enemies to replenish the player's; scrambling the wires of Megabyte's basic weapon, the turret, to turn it against enemies; and freezing enemies for a limited period of time. Throughout each level is an item that can be used to power up the player's weapon, replenish health or give the player temporary invincibility. Some items are hidden, while others appear after defeating an enemy.

However, IGN criticized the game's digital control, writing that it plays better with an analog controller. Next Generation stated that \\"The game is technically fine, very playable, but it somehow lacks cohesion as an adventure.\\" GamePro praised the graphics and soundtrack, and called it \\"the rare game that transcends its license to become a great stand-alone experience,\\" while mentioning minor issues such as difficult platform gameplay, the time needed to learn the controls, and the lack of selectable difficulty levels.

Located beside the Buda Castle complex in the ancient Castle District, it has served as the official residence and workspace of the President of Hungary since 2003. S√°ndor Palace is the 37th largest palace in present-day Hungary. Neoclassical style facade details. History 19th century The original Neoclassical style palace was begun about 1803, and completed about 1806. Count Vincent S√°ndor commissioned it, and it was named after him. Count Vincent S√°ndor was a philosopher and aristocrat in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His son Count M√≥ric S√°ndor de Szlavnicza (1805‚Äì1878) was better known in Budapest and Vienna, from fame for acrobatic jousts. The palace then next belonged to Archduke Albrecht, the Imperial Governor of Hungary, until the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848. After that the palace and its adjacent buildings facing the square were rented as government offices. ;Prime Ministers The most prestigious tenant was the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy, who in 1867 leased it for the Hungarian government from the Pallavicini family. He would later obtain ownership of the palace following a property swap. Andrassy renovated the building, which by then was badly in need of repair, with the help of the architect Mikl√≥s Ybl. He renovated the ground floor and used it as his offices, while the first floor became his residence. In all, nineteen Hungarian Prime Ministers have lived in the palace, each adapting the building to their own tastes. Destruction in World War II After the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919, S√°ndor Palace continued as the Prime Minister's residence until World War II. In 1941, during the war, the grief- stricken P√°l Teleki committed suicide in the palace. Less than four years later, Allied aircraft bombed S√°ndor Palace, and the building was left in ruins. Anything in the palace that was of value was taken as war booty. Although the ruins did not fall victim to the bulldozer, the palace remained neglected until the Revolutions of 1989. Restoration Following the change from the Communist political system in Hungary in 1989, and thanks to a devoted team of restoration workers, a roof was erected over the ruins and the walls were supported. Over the years, S√°ndor Palace was gradually restored to its former glory, and the interior renovated in 2002. Most of the furnishings and objects are replicas of the originals that had been destroyed. The restoration was conducted on the basis of the original blueprints, recovered in 1983, and the detailed history of contemporary maps. Architecture & design Exterior features The former coat of arms of Hungary on the southeast side. Sentries guarding southwest palace door The southwest fa√ßade of the palace, which faces the square, features a pair of light green doors with the inscription K√∂zt√°rsas√°gi Eln√∂ki Hivatal (Hungarian: President of the Republic's Office) immediately above. On the iron balustrade above the inscription, is the modern coat of arms of Hungary, flanked by the Hungarian and European Union flags. The southeast fa√ßade of the palace has a similar pair of light green doors with no inscription. On the iron balustrade above these doors, the Hungarian and EU flags appear alongside the former Hungarian coat of arms, which depict Hungary quartered with Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Fiume and Transylvania. Above the first floor on the southeast side is a tympanum, in imitation of Graeco-Roman architecture, with the Roman numeral MDCCCVI (1806, the year of the completion of the original palace). Interior features President George W. Bush meets with Hungarian President L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom at The Red Salon Mrs. Laura Bush attends a tea hosted by Hungarian First Lady Erzs√©bet S√≥lyom at The Blue Salon Visitors can enter the building via the southern main gate and the main staircase. The staircase has a mellow glistening surface and elegant gold-plated cast iron railings. The entrance lobby is decorated with simple striped damask tapestries, and the walls are lined with Biedermeier chairs, in accordance with function. The Round Salon houses an identical replica of the original floor designed in 1928 by Rezs≈ë Hikisch. The walls are white and the ceiling is adorned with murals. The objects and the statues in the niches all replicate those originally housed in the palace. The Small Empire Salon once linked the private and public parts of the palace. Today the President uses this room for informal meetings. A recently discovered series of panels featuring mythological figures by K√°roly Lotz line the walls as a frieze, and an octagonal picture of a goddess was added to the ceiling. The Blue Salon, or Gobelin Hall, is the most exquisite room in the palace with its baroque-style furniture and is used for larger meetings. The Red Salon, or Maria Theresa Salon, is the most elegant room in the palace. It previously featured a portrait of Empress Maria Theresa, which is lost. Its place is now occupied by a portrait of the Empress dressed for her coronation as Queen of Hungary. The murals in the room were designed by Mikl√≥s Ybl. The room was especially tailored in memory of the Reconciliation between the monarch and the government, thus it contains no portraits of Hungarian Presidents or Prime Ministers which are prominent in other rooms. The lavish Hall of Mirrors is used by the President for very formal events, such as the reception of ambassadors. The President's Conference Room is located in the southwest corner of the palace. It has views overlooking the Danube and Buda Castle and was entirely reconstructed in the 1990s after the original room was destroyed. The President's Study, based on a 1920s design, was originally the Ministers' Waiting Room. Portraits of former Prime Ministers line the walls. The Tea Salon overlooks the central courtyard and portraits of the jouster M√≥ric S√°ndor line the walls. The Knights' Hall, in the northeast corner of the palace, was formerly used as the stables. The red stone horse troughs still survive. The room was later used for press conferences, and is still sometimes used for this purpose today. Public access The palace is occasionally open to the public at weekends during the summer months, and sometimes hosts exhibitions about the Hungarian political system.

Combined, the three games have sold more than 34 million copies as of December 2019,https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/we-have-a-myriad-of-ideas-cloud-chambers- kelley-gilmore-reveals-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-next-bioshock- game/ making the series one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. A motion picture based on the first game had been planned but was ultimately cancelled. Work on Infinite led Ken Levine to drastically downsize and rebrand Irrational Games into Ghost Story Games to work on smaller titles, while 2K Games remained interested in the property. 2K formally announced that a new BioShock game was in the works by a newly created internal studio, Cloud Chamber, in December 2019.https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news- release-details/2k-announces-newly-formed-studio-cloud-chambertm-developing- next?field_nir_news_date_value Concept and development Concerning the influences behind the game's story and setting, Levine said, \\"I have my useless liberal arts degree, so I've read stuff from Ayn Rand, George Orwell and all the sort of utopian and dystopian writings of the 20th century, and having developed the System Shock franchise, some of my first games, I felt that the atmosphere was a good one to set for a dystopian environment, one we borrowed heavily from System Shock.\\" Levine has also mentioned an interest in \\"stem cell research and the moral issues that go around [it].\\" In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books Nineteen Eighty-Four and Logan's Run, representing societies that have \\"really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people.\\" BioShock is a spiritual successor to the System Shock games, and was produced by former developers of that series. Levine claims his team had been thinking about making another game in the same vein since they produced System Shock 2. In his narration of a video initially screened for the press at E3 2006, Levine pointed out many similarities between the games. There are several comparable gameplay elements: plasmids in BioShock supplied by \\"EVE hypos\\" serve the same function as \\"Psionic Abilities\\" supplied by \\"PSI hypos\\" in System Shock 2; the player needs to deal with security cameras, machine gun turrets, and hostile robotic drones, and has the ability to hack them in both games; ammunition conservation is stressed as \\"a key gameplay feature\\"; and audio tape recordings fulfill the same storytelling role that e-mail logs did in the System Shock games. The \\"ghosts\\" (phantom images that replay tragic incidents in the places they occurred) from System Shock 2 also exist in BioShock, as do modifiable weapons with multiple ammunition types and researching enemies for increased damage. Additionally, Atlas guides the player along by radio, in much the same way Janice Polito does in System Shock 2, with each having a similar twist mid- game. Both games also give the player more than one method of completing tasks, allowing for emergent gameplay. In the reveal of the third game of the series, BioShock Infinite, Ken Levine stated that the name \\"BioShock\\" is not in reference to any specific setting or location, but instead a means of encapsulating common gameplay elements that reflects on their earlier games such as System Shock 2, and the BioShock series.  Gameplay  The games in the BioShock series are first-person shooters. The series is considered the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, which many of the developers were previously involved with through Irrational Games. While specific mechanics differ between all three games, they share a common theme of having the player use a combination of physical weapons such as guns and melee weapons, superhuman powers‚Äîincluding both active and passive abilities‚Äîgranted by genetic alterations (plasmids in the first two games, vigors in Infinite), and features of the game environment to strategically work their way through enemy forces and tactical situations. These weapons and powers can be used in various combinations to aid in defeating foes; for example, electrocuting an enemy makes them prone to being knocked out from a subsequent melee attack. Scenarios in the game often feature multiple approaches that the player can take, such as opting to avoid enemies through stealth and deception, hacking a security turret to turn against enemy forces, or directly engaging in combat. The player is able to customize their weapons and genetic enhancements for the style of play they prefer. In addition to collecting new weapons and genetic modifications, the player gains ammunition, mana-like power required to engage the genetic modifications (EVE in the first two games, Salt in Infinite), restorative items, scrap items used to craft new materials, and in-game money to buy various improvements at vending machines throughout the game. Games BioShock BioShock was released on August 21, 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. A PlayStation 3 port was released on October 17, 2008. The game was critically very well received, with positive reviews that praised its \\"morality-based\\" storyline, immersive environment and Ayn Rand-inspired dystopian back-story. According to Take-Two's chairman Strauss Zelnick, the game has sold around 3 million copies . BioShock takes place in 1960, in the fictional underwater city of Rapture. Built in the late 1940s by business tycoon Andrew Ryan, it was meant to be a laissez-faire social environment for individuals to work, live, and prosper out of the increasingly oppressive hands of the world's governments and authorities. Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, Dr. Yi Suchong, and other scientists discovered a substance called ADAM, harvested from sea slugs that could be made into plasmids that gave the user psychokinetic powers. Frank Fontaine, a former gangster and businessman who brought black market goods to Rapture, found a way to harvest ADAM by implanting the slugs in the bodies of young girls, \\"Little Sisters\\", and profited from this. Ryan led an attack that apparently killed Fontaine and seized his ADAM production facilities. To protect the Little Sisters, Ryan created Big Daddies by conditioning and mutating humans into armored diving suits, designed to protect the Little Sisters. Leading up to New Year's Eve 1959, a new figure, Atlas, rose from the worker classes to lead a new revolt against Ryan, killing many and leading Ryan to mutate a number of his followers into Splicers to protect himself, creating the downfall of Rapture's utopia. In 1960, Jack, the player-character, is in a plane crash over the ocean that is near the lighthouse that houses a bathysphere that takes him to Rapture. Atlas contacts Jack to ask his help against Ryan's forces. Jack discovers the Little Sisters and is warned by Tenenbaum not to harm them. After fighting through the failing city, Jack makes it to Ryan's offices. Ryan, patiently playing golf while waiting for Jack, reveals that Jack is his illegitimate son, and had been mentally conditioned by Fontaine to coerce his actions, specifically following any order preceded by the phrase \\"Would you kindly...?\\". Jack realizes Atlas has been using this phrase since his arrival. Ryan accepts his fate, using the phrase to make Jack kill him with a golf club, and Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, having gone into hiding to plan a new strategy against Ryan. Fontaine leaves Jack to die, but he is rescued by Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters. Tenenbaum removes the conditioning from Jack's mind and urges him to defeat Fontaine and take the Little Sisters to the surface. In a final battle against Jack, Fontaine injects himself with numerous plasmids, but Jack and the Little Sisters overpower him, allowing for them to escape. BioShock 2 BioShock 2 was released worldwide on February 9, 2010. The game was developed by a new design team, although it contained members of the team for the original BioShock. BioShock 2 was mainly developed by 2K Marin, with 2K Australia, Arkane Studios, and Digital Extremes providing additional support. 2K Boston, formerly Irrational Games, also assisted the game's development, with series creator Ken Levine providing input. The story received major changes over the course of development. Garry Schyman, the composer of the first game, returned to create the score for BioShock 2. BioShock 2 takes place eight years after the events of BioShock, with the city having fallen into a dystopia. A new leader, Sofia Lamb, has risen up in the power vacuum after the death of Ryan and Fontaine, and has created a Utilitarianism and Collectivism-type cult of personality. Prior to the events of BioShock, Lamb had severed the bond between the Big Daddy Delta (the player-character) and her daughter Eleanor, the Little Sister he was assigned to protect. Delta, left for dead, wakes years later by Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters, and told he must re-establish his bond with Eleanor soon or will fall into a coma. Delta fights his way through Splicers as well as those loyal to Lamb, defeats Lamb, and sacrifices himself to help Eleanor, Tenenbaum, and other Little Sisters to escape Rapture. Minerva's Den is a downloadable content campaign for BioShock 2, in which the player assumes the role of Subject Sigma, another Alpha Series Big Daddy, as he travels through Minerva's Den, home to Rapture's Central Computing. It was released on August 31, 2010. BioShock Infinite BioShock Infinite was announced on August 12, 2010, for release on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems on February 26, 2013; on December 7, 2012, Irrational Games announced that release would be delayed by another month, to March 26, 2013. Previously known as \\"Project Icarus\\", BioShock Infinite is not a direct sequel or prequel to the original game, but carries many of the same gameplay concepts from the BioShock title. BioShock Infinite takes place in 1912 in Columbia, a city suspended in the air through a combination of \\"quantum levitation\\" and giant blimps and balloons. It was built and launched in 1893 by the American government, during the Worlds' Fair in Chicago, to much fanfare and publicity. However, it was later involved in an \\"international incident\\" by firing upon a group of Chinese civilians during the Boxer Rebellion. The city was disavowed by the United States government, and the location of the city was soon lost to everyone else. As with Rapture, Columbia's intellectuals were able to develop new technology, including Vigors that grant the user new psychokinetic powers. At the same time, strange rifts in the space-time continuum called \\"Tears\\" appear across the city, and anachronistic elements can be seen and heard. The player-character, Booker DeWitt, a disgraced member of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency discharged after his actions at the Wounded Knee Massacre, is sent to Columbia by Robert and Rosalind Lutece (the Lutece Twins) to recover Elizabeth, a young woman that had been kidnapped by Columbia's leader, Zachary Comstock, and protected by the robotic Songbird. Booker rescues Elizabeth (who subsequently accompanies the player as an AI-controller ally), who appears to have control over the Tears. Their escape is hampered by fighting between the Founders, those loyal to Comstock, and the Vox Populi, residents of Columbia who have faced persecution. Booker comes to discover that Elizabeth is his daughter from one of numerous parallel universes, and that Comstock is a version of himself from yet another parallel universe whom had accepted a baptism to atone for his actions at Wounded Knee and established the beliefs that led to Columbia's founding. Comstock had kidnapped Elizabeth from Booker while she was an infant with the help of Tear technology provided by the Lutece Twins (in essence the same person from alternate dimensions), but in his escape, Elizabeth's finger was severed by the closure of a Tear, giving her the power over Tears. Booker eventually defeats Songbird and Comstock with the help of Elizabeth and the Twins, as Comstock had turned on them. Elizabeth shows Booker that these events will always repeat through the multitude of parallel universes, and the only way to end the cycle is to kill all versions of Booker before he can turn into Comstock at the baptism. Booker accepts this fate, allowing Elizabeth to drown him. A downloadable content expansion, Burial at Sea, was released in two-parts on November 12, 2013 and March 25, 2014. Elizabeth finds one version of Booker has ended up into the city of Rapture from BioShock, working as a private detective. Elizabeth joins him as they search for a missing girl named Sally, but become caught up in the events of Atlas' war against Andrew Ryan. They find that scientists of Rapture have been working with those on Columbia through Rifts, sharing technology such as Plasmids and Vigors, and the Big Daddies and Songbird. After discovering Sally has already become a Little Sister, and losing her Rift-controlling powers, Elizabeth kills Booker, and sacrifices herself to assure that Sally and the other Little Sisters can be rescued by Jack. Future games In February 2014, while promoting Burial at Sea: Episode Two, series director Ken Levine revealed that BioShock Infinite would be Irrational Games' last game in the BioShock series. Levine let go of most of the staff of Irrational Games in February 2017 and rebranded the division as Ghost Story Games within 2K Games to work on smaller narrative titles. The rights to BioShock remained with 2K. In a 2016 interview, Levine explained that the pressure and stress of managing a large team as he had to for Infinite had impacted his health and personal relationships, and rather than stay on to build a larger game, decided to leave the BioShock franchise. Following Levine's decision, 2K Games stated that the BioShock series will continue, telling Game Informer they \\"look forward to exploring the next BioShock\\". In May 2014, 2K Games stated that work on the BioShock series was continuing with 2K Marin at the helm, despite the fact that in October 2013, 2K Marin had reportedly been shut down by 2K Games. It was reported that work on this title had started as early as 2015 at the Austin-based third-party studio Certain Affinity. However, by 2016, 2K decided to pull the project from Certain Affinity and bring it in-house, establishing a yet-to-be-named studio, as well as rebooting the development process. Previously, Kotaku had reported in 2018 that several employees from Hangar 13, another development studio within 2K Games, had joined a new studio in the San Francisco area and were working on a project known under the working title Parkside, believed by other Hangar 13 employees to be a BioShock title. 2K formally announced in December 2019 that a new BioShock title was under development but was still some years from release. The game is being developed by a new internal studio, Cloud Chamber, with offices based in San Francisco (2K Marin's old offices) and a newly established location in Montreal. The studio is led by Kelley Gilmore, who had previously worked at Firaxis. The lead staff include lead art director Scott Sinclair, who had worked on the first BioShock, Jonathan Pelling as design director having previously done level work for BioShock and Infinite, and Hoagy de la Plante as creative director after having worked on the other BioShock games in numerous roles.  Themes   BioShock  A visit to the GE Building and its statue of Atlas in New York City was the principal idea that led to the art deco stylings of BioShock. The thematic core of BioShock was born when Levine was walking at Rockefeller Center near the GE Building in New York City. He saw the uniqueness of the art deco styling of the building along with imagery around the building such as the statue of Atlas near it, and recognized that these were spaces that had not been experienced in the first- person shooter genre. The history of the Rockefeller Center fed into the story concept; Levine noted how the Center had started construction prior to the Great Depression of the 1920s; when the primary financiers had pulled out, John D. Rockefeller backed the remaining construction to complete the project himself, as \\"a great man building an architectural triumph against all the odds\\". The history of Rapture and the character of Andrew Ryan is loosely based on Rockefeller's story. He also considered that many of the characters of Rapture were all people who were oppressed once before in the lives and now free of that oppression, have turned around and become the oppressors, a fact he felt resonated throughout human history. The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of Night Trap. However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including Ayn Rand, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell, and considered their ideas \\"fascinating\\". He brought in the ideas of Objectivism that Rand primarily outlined in the book Atlas Shrugged, that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan's work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings. This was extended to the use of the little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit. 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game \\"where the player gets punished for doing the right thing\\". They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this \\"a massive kludge\\" into the game's fiction. The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets. Levine desired to have only one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters \\"much more ambiguous\\", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters. Levine also noted that \\"it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me.\\" Other elements came into the story design. Levine had an interest in \\"stem cell research and the moral issues that go around [it]\\". In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books Nineteen Eighty-Four and Logan's Run, representing societies that have \\"really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people\\". The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like The Manchurian Candidate, as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon \\"Would you kindly\\" after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as \\"Would you kill people, even innocent people, to survive?\\", later working that phrase into the first script for the game.  BioShock 2  Sofia Lamb, the main antagonist in BioShock 2, is loosely based on German philosopher Karl Marx. In 2013, Liz Lanier of Game Informer included Lamb among top ten female villains in video games, stating that \\"an extremist obsessed with the \\"greater good\\", Lamb will sacrifice anything and anyone for her own agenda; whether that means brainwashing or murdering to create her utopia, she's down.\\" In contrast to the first BioShocks focus on objectivism, libertarianism, and philosophies derived from or related to Ayn Rand, BioShock 2 focuses on versions of utilitarian and collectivist ideals. Lamb's philosophy of altruism is based on historical figures Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill, along with modern figures such as Richard Dawkins. In comparison to BioShocks questions of free will and humans' destiny, BioShock 2s director Jordan Thomas said that the player character is \\"almost the ultimate individual\\" whom Lamb goads to fulfill her goals. BioShock 2 also deals with cult of personalities, Marxism, abandonment, technocracy, moral absolutism, altruism, fatherhood, class war, equalitarianism, capitalism, utopianism, being, childhood, socialism, selfishness, adolescence, poverty, liberalism, moral relativism, rationalism, empiricism, Christianity, Social Darwinism, subversion of being, transformation, genetic determinism, and the benefits of family and religion. Professor Ryan Lizardi draws parallels between BioShock 2s themes of community versus the individual and the issues of McCarthyism and the hippie movement that occurred around the time period of the game's setting. \\"As this sequel is an extension of the first game's storylines and characters, there are direct contrasts between the extreme politics of Andrew Ryan's objectivism and the extreme religion/politics of Lamb's collectivism\\", he writes. \\"BioShock 2 specifically asks players to question all sides of debates when extreme stances are taken, and asks players to weigh their decisions in an alternate and complex history.\\" Lizardi also noted BioShock 2s multiplayer option, \\"which in games often represents the least narratively challenging moments, but which in this game is used as a place to hammer home a connection to the first game's politically extreme spectrum.\\"  BioShock Infinite  American exceptionalism, as exhibited at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, was central to the theme of Infinite. Creative lead Ken Levine stated that players are supposed to draw their own conclusions from the game, and ultimately decide \\"what is good and bad\\". He explained that \\"there are many parts of Infinite that are open to interpretation, and the purpose is that you draw your own theories from them\\". To this end, Levine avoided providing an authoritative final answer regarding the game's ending, replying \\"What actually matters is what people think. Why does my interpretation matter more than yours?\\" Acknowledging that Infinites themes left fans debating and frustrated, Levine was nevertheless satisfied by the game's opacity, stating that it was his intent, and compared the game's interpretation of quantum mechanics to some of his favorite films; 2001: A Space Odyssey, Fight Club, The Master, Miller's Crossing, and There Will Be Blood. Rob Crossley of CVG stated that \\"To [Levine], the [game's] Many Worlds Theory is a storytelling device; one that gives his narrative something unique in games yet celebrated in film: interpretability. Levine claimed that the core messages in Infinite were neither personal nor political, insisting instead that they were historical. In response to people discussing Columbia \\"as a particularly racist society,\\" he said that the game was making no particular point about the theme of racism and that the game's depiction of it was merely \\"more a factor of the time.\\" The racism portrayed in Columbia was based on the nature of American exceptionalism of the early 20th Century, and seen by Levine \\"more as a reflection of what race relations in the U.S. were like in 1912;\\" Levine explained that the game was \\"less about exploring the good and bad sides of racism and more just a reflection of the time and how it impacted that era.\\" He noted that several historic American figures such as the Founding Fathers, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt were \\"men of their times\\", great men who nevertheless held racist beliefs because of the culture in which they were brought up. Consequently, Levine reasoned that the depictions of white supremacy and white nationalism were warranted in the game, saying that to not do so would be \\"dishonest\\" and \\"strange\\" to the time period. Many reviewers praised the game for its treatment of race. In addition to racism, the game was interpreted as tackling political and social problems, as well as exploring several themes such as constants and variables, American exceptionalism, extremism, religious fundamentalism, ethnic nationalism, fanaticism, cultism, authoritarian populism, religion, dichotomy, sameness, multiple realities, fatalism, choice, consequences, free will, hope, self- loathing, denial, rebirth, and redemption. The game's theme of \\"constants and variables\\" received attention, primarily drawn towards the characters of Robert and Rosalind Lutece, who are shown to be key figures behind Columbia and the drivers for the game's events. In an early scene, they ask Booker to flip a coin, which has come up heads 122 times out of 122 flips (evidenced by tally marks on both sides of the sandwich board worn by Robert), indicating that the Luteces have recruited a different Booker from a similar number of alternate realities, in order to accomplish their aims. The coin-flip is a \\"constant\\" present in every universe and is thus destined to always have the same result. This scene has been compared to works like The Garden of Forking Paths and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, which have similar themes about the subject of choice versus fate.  Fandom  Meg Turney cosplaying as Elizabeth at WonderCon 2013. The series has a large fanbase. Fans of BioShock have made notable artwork, books, and fan fiction about the series. It also enjoys significant popularity among cosplayers, primarily due to the series unique characters and setting. In 2014, a fan of the series created portions of the original BioShock in Unreal Engine 4. In 2016, a YouTube account titled rosslittlejohn recreated the original game's \\"Medical Pavilion\\" level with the same engine. In 2018, fans of the series released BioShock: From Rapture to Columbia, a detailed book related to \\"the development of the games and their stories, citing influences from real world history and mythology and recounting bits of the story in a detailed synopsis.\\" Reception and legacy The series has received critical acclaim for its morality-based storyline, immersive environments, and unique settings. It is commonly listed among both audiences and critics as one of the greatest video game series of all time and a demonstration of video game as an art form. The original's plot twist, where the player discovers that the player-character Jack has been coerced into events by the trigger phrase, \\"Would you kindly...\\", is considered one of the strongest narrative elements of recent games, in part that it subverted the expectation that the player has control and influence on the game. In February 2011 the Smithsonian Institution announced it would be holding an exhibit dedicated to the art of video games. Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. BioShock was considered a front runner to be displayed because of its status as a game that demonstrated how artistic the medium can be. John Lanchester of the London Review of Books recognized BioShock as one of the first video games to break into coverage of mainstream media to be covered as a work of art arising from its narrative aspects, whereas before video games had failed to enter into the \\"cultural discourse\\", or otherwise covered due to moral controversies they created. Peter Suderman for Vox in 2016 wrote that BioShock was the first game that demonstrated that video games could be a work of art, particularly highlighting that the game plays on the theme of giving the illusion of individual control.  Novels  Rapture BioShock: Rapture is a novel written by John Shirley, covering the founding of Rapture, and life in Rapture before the events of BioShock. It was published by Titan books on July 19, 2011. Mind in Revolt BioShock Infinite: Mind in Revolt is a novella written by Joe Fielder and Ken Levine, offering insight to the world of Columbia and the motivations of Daisy Fitzroy, the leader of the Vox Populi. Mind in Revolt had an eBook release on February 13, 2013, with the hardcover version released later through the Irrational Games store. Other media Art books BioShock: Breaking the Mold, a book containing artwork from the game, was released by 2K Games on August 13, 2007. It is available in both low and high resolution, in PDF format from 2K Games's official website. Until October 1, 2007, 2K Games was sending a printed version of the book to the owners of the collector's edition whose Big Daddy figurines had been broken, as compensation for the time it took to replace them. On October 31, 2008, the winners of \\"Breaking the Mold: Developers Edition Artbook Cover Contest\\" were announced on cultofrapture.com. Deco Devolution: The Art of BioShock 2 was released in 2010. The Art of BioShock Infinite was released in 2013.  BioShock: Industrial Revolution  Pre-orders of BioShock Infinite granted the purchaser with an access code to a browser-based puzzle game, BioShock Infinite: Industrial Revolution, developed in conjunction with Lazy 8 Studios. Irrational had concerns developing a pre-release puzzle game to tie into the retail title. Several of the Irrational team had played and enjoyed Lazy 8's steampunk-like Independent Games Festival-winning title Cogs and considered using them to build this pre- release game. Irrational believed the studio would be able to develop a game that would provide \\"challenging puzzles in a steampunk style\\", according to Lazy 8's founder, Rob Jagnow. The game's mechanics are a simplified version of the Cogs puzzles, and involve creating devices from basic machines like gears and pulleys to achieve a specific action; the game contains 59 such puzzles culled from more than 70. Lazy 8 focused on the gear puzzles as they were a fan-favorite from Cogs. Jagnow found through happenstance that the game's mechanics led to a \\"dual-space system\\" that may be challenging to the player. The game places the player as a mechanic aboard Columbia, who can align with either the Founders or the Vox Populi; decisions during the game's story on which side to support are permanent, even if the player attempts an earlier puzzle. Jagnow, who worked on the story under Irrational's guidance, wanted to have the player \\"constantly second-guess their decisions\\" on which side to support. Solving the steampunk-based puzzles grants the player unlockable items within the main BioShock Infinite game once it is released. Soundtrack 2K Games released an orchestral score soundtrack on their official homepage on August 24, 2007. Available in MP3 format, the score‚Äîcomposed by Garry Schyman‚Äîcontains 12 of the 22 tracks from the game. The Limited Edition version of the game came with The Rapture EP remixes by Moby and Oscar The Punk. The three remixed tracks on the CD include \\"Beyond the Sea\\", \\"God Bless the Child\\" and \\"Wild Little Sisters\\"; the original recordings of these songs are in the game. In BioShock, the player encounters phonographs that play music from the 1940s and 1950s as background music. In total, 30 licensed songs can be heard throughout the game. BioShocks soundtrack was released on a vinyl LP with the BioShock 2 Special Edition. Collections BioShock: Ultimate Rapture Edition BioShock: Ultimate Rapture Edition is a retail package containing BioShock and BioShock 2, along with all downloadable content for both games including Minerva's Den, and a set of stickers based on BioShock Infinite. The edition was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in North America on January 14, 2013. BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition is a retail package containing BioShock Infinite and Burial at Sea. It also includes the Clash In the Clouds arena mode, as well as all pre-order bonuses and exclusive weapons. BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition was released on November 4, 2014. BioShock: The Collection BioShock: The Collection is a remastered collection of the BioShock series, containing BioShock, BioShock 2, BioShock Infinite, and all of their single-player downloadable content including Minerva's Den and Burial at Sea. It features updated graphics and a documentary with commentary from Ken Levine and Shawn Robertson. The multiplayer component of BioShock 2 is not included in the collection. It was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in September 2016. BioShock Infinites original PC version was ported to console for the collection, but was not remastered since it \\"already meets current-gen console standards and runs smoothly on high visual settings\\", according to 2K Games. Players that own either of the first two games on Windows will be able to update to the remastered versions for free. The Collection, as well as individual releases of the remastered games, are scheduled for release on the Nintendo Switch on May 29, 2020. Cancelled projects Film adaptation Industry rumors after BioShocks release suggested a film adaptation of the game would be made, utilizing similar green-screen filming techniques as in the film 300 to recreate the environments of Rapture. On May 9, 2008, Take-Two announced a deal with Universal Studios to produce a BioShock film, to be directed by Gore Verbinski and written by John Logan. The film was expected to be released in 2010, but was put on hold due to budget concerns. On August 24, 2009 it was revealed that Verbinski had dropped out of the project due to the studio's decision to film overseas to keep the budget under control. Verbinski reportedly feels this would have hindered his work on Rango. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was in talks to direct with Verbinski as producer. In January 2010 the project was in pre-production stage, with director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and Braden Lynch, a voice artist from BioShock 2, working on the film. By July the film was facing budget issues but producer Gore Verbinski said they were working it out. He also said the film would be a \\"hard R\\", restricted for people younger than 17 without adult accompaniment. Ken Levine, during an interview on August 30, 2010, said: \\"I will say that it is still an active thing and it's something we are actively talking about and actively working on.\\" Verbinski later cited that by trying to maintain the \\"restricted\\" rating, they were unable to find any studios that would back the effort, putting the film's future in jeopardy. Levine confirmed in March 2013 that the film had been cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not do as well as the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. Universal subsequently brought a new director in to work with the smaller budget but with whom Levine and 2K Games did not feel was a good fit to the material. Universal gave Levine the decision to end the project, which he took, believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises they would have had to make. BioShock Vita A version of BioShock for the PlayStation Vita, tentatively known as BioShock Vita, was announced at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo by Levine during Sony's press event, alongside the introduction of the Vita, with few details revealed at that time. Levine later described the title as still in the works, a game that would neither be similar to the first two BioShock titles nor be a version of Infinite for the Vita. He stated that \\"I'd rather do something that's an experiment and that's a little different. And is unique for the franchise.\\" By April 2012, with Irrational working heavily to finish Infinite, Levine had put the Vita game on hold. In interviews in December 2012, Levine revealed that little work had been done on the game, as the dealing with working with Sony was in the hands of Irrational's publisher, Take-Two Interactive, though he was still interested in the title. Levine revealed in July 2014 that the deals between Sony and Take-Two had failed to materialize, and the game was unlikely to be made, despite Sony being bullish on promoting the future title at its Vita reveal before any development work had been started. He further clarified that his idea would have been a strategy-style game similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, with the game set prior to the fall of Rapture.

He is known for his actions as a negotiator between Themistocles and the Persian ruler Xerxes I during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. Sicinnus deceived Xerxes into sending his fleet into Themistocles' trap. Battle of Salamis In 480 BC, he was employed by his master in a stratagem directed against the Persian king, Xerxes, before the Battle of Salamis. The Greek fleet, which had assembled at Salamis, was composed of several contingents. Although the Athenian was the largest, command was held by the Spartan Eurybiades. He and other Peloponnesian leaders desired to withdraw from Salamis towards the Peloponnese, while Themistocles insisted that they stay and fight at Salamis, where the straits would negate the Persian numerical superiority.Herodotus, VIII, 79 In order to avoid a possible withdrawal and commit his allies to the fight, Themistocles sent Sicinnus to Xerxes, who convinced the Persian king that the Greeks were in near panic, and that if he wanted them not to escape, the Persian fleet should blockade the escape route on the southwestern side of Salamis. Herodotus, VIII, 75 Themistocles thus lured Xerxes into his trap: the Persian fleet was lured into the straits, while at the same time, the Egyptian squadron, one of the best in the Persian navy, remained committed in the blockade and absent from the battle. Aftermath After their victory at Salamis, the Greeks pursued the Persian fleet as far as Andros, but then came to the resolution to continue the chase no further, lest they should inspire the enemy with the courage of despair. Hereupon Themistocles, according to Herodotus, again sent Sicinnus, with others on whom he could depend, to Xerxes, to claim merit with him for having dissuaded the Greeks from intercepting his flight. As a reward for his services, Themistocles afterwards enriched Sicinnus, and obtained for him the citizenship of Thespiae. Sikinnis dance Some have identified the subject of the present article with the Sicinnus who is mentioned by Athenaeus as the reputed inventor of the Sikinnis dance (·º° œÉŒØŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒΩŒπœÇ, gen.: œÉŒπŒ∫ŒØŒΩŒΩŒπŒ¥ŒøœÇ) in the satyr play. Athenaeus tells us that, according to some, he was a barbarian, according to others, a Cretan. The dancers were called Sikinnistai (Œ£ŒπŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒ±ŒØ).Greek musical writings, Volume 2 By Andrew Barker Page 289 Lucian states that the dance (which was initially dedicated to Sabazios) was invented by the deity Sikinnis, a nymph of Kybele (Lucian, Dialogue on Dance, 22).

Plot With a view to escaping his employers' daughter, who has amorous designs on him, Dr. Simon Sparrow (Bogarde) signs on as medical officer on a cargo ship, \\"SS Lotus\\". The ship is commanded by hot-tempered and authoritarian Captain Wentworth Hogg. Dr. Sparrow overcomes initial seasickness and settles into life on board. After arriving in a Brazilian port (a local woman demands two hundred cruzeiros from Dr. Sparrow), Sparrow meets H√©l√®ne Colbert (Bardot), a sexy young French nightclub singer.

History The railway line between and Walton was proposed by the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway (LO&PJ;) and authorised in 1846; later that year the LO&PJ; was amalgamated with the East Lancashire Railway (ELR), which opened the line in 1849. In August 1859 the ELR was amalgamated with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR), and in October that year, the station at Midge Hall was opened. It was from , and replaced an earlier station at , from Liverpool. The station was closed by British Railways on 2 October 1961. It retained its original Lancashire and Yorkshire railway signalbox until 1972 until the general Preston area resignalling programme, whereupon the old box was demolished and replaced with a new construction on the opposite side of the level crossing. Trains still stop at Midge Hall signal box to exchange a token for the single line onward to Rufford - this is a vestige of the 1970s and early 1980s, when the then recently singled branch line retained double track from Midge Hall into Preston.Railscot - Midge Hall in the late 1970s The portion from here north to Farington Curve Junction was also singled in 1983, but the existing combination of track circuit block & key token operation was retained after completion of the work. Reopening proposals There have been talks amongst the local community for the possible reopening of the station. A study held in 1991 concluded that there would be a forecasted 7500 journeys per annum using the station, generating roughly ¬£15,000 in revenue with an average cost of ¬£2 per journey. This was deemed uneconomical due to the high costs of construction (¬£500,000) coupled with ¬£15,000 in ongoing annual maintenance costs, which would barely be covered by the revenue alone. A meeting held in 2003 concluded that whilst forecasted passenger numbers will likely be higher than that of the 1991 study (due largely to residential development in recent years), numbers may only be in the region of 10,000 to 30,000 and revenue from these passengers would likely still not cover the costs for reopening and thus remains uneconomical to reopen. In 2012, the Ormskirk, Preston and Southport Travellers‚Äô Association called talks with Lancashire County Council about the possible reopening of the Midge Hall station as a \\"key component\\" of the Council's thinking.Newsletter September 2014 OPSTA In the summer of 2014, Lancashire County Council confirmed that a business case for reopening was being formulated.Campaign relaunched for station Leyland GuardianRenewed call for station to reopen before development Lancashire Evening Post Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, page 37, states a review to introduce new Merseyrail battery trains will be undertaken in 2020, in view to put Preston interchange station onto the Merseyrail network by extending the Merseyrail Northern Line from Ormskirk to Preston. The aim is to have Preston one of the terminals of the Northern Line, with Burscough Junction, Rufford and Croston stations brought onto the Merseyrail network. Passengers would have direct trains into Liverpool and Preston. The document states, \\"The potential use of battery powered Merseyrail units may improve the business case\\".

E. F. Britten. \\"Sir Galahad\\" is a poem written by Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, and published in his 1842 collection of poetry. It is one of his many poems that deal with the legend of King Arthur, and describes Galahad experiencing a vision of the Holy Grail. The subject of the poem was later included in \\"The Holy Grail\\" section of Tennyson's Idylls of the King, but the latter version depicts Galahad as a pious individual who is grimly determined to fulfill his destiny. Sir Galahad, in contrast, depicts Galahad as proud, and has almost cheerful undertones. Background In 1833, Tennyson's close friend Arthur Hallam died. The death greatly affected both Tennyson and his sister Emily, and he withdrew from society as he slowly dealt with the pain. By mid-summer 1834, they slowly began to participate together in social events once again. On one occasion, Tennyson, Emily, and his other sister Mary were invited to visit friends in Dorking, and then travel onwards to see the Hallam family. Tennyson, however, set out on his own, and spent time alone at Leith Hill, Dorking. It was during this time that he began working on a version of Sir Galahad, along with an early version of The Blackbird and a version of \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\".Thorn 1975 pp. 122‚Äì134 The poem was completed in September 1834.Shaw 1976 p. 202 It was published in the second volume of Tennyson's 1842 collection of poems, along with other poems discussing the Arthurian legend. These included \\"Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere\\" and \\"Morte d'Arthur\\".Martin 1979 p. 263 The Galahad story was picked up again by Tennyson in the section \\"The Holy Grail\\" of Idylls of the King. The later work was first published in 1869.Epperly 1992 p. 105 Poem The poem begins with a description of Galahad that, in terms of rhythm and rhyme, is almost cheerful even though the language is not:Epperly 1992 p. 106 :My good blade carves the casques of men, :My tough lance thrusteth sure, :My strength is as the strength of ten :Because my heart is pure. (lines 1‚Äì4) As the poem continues, Galahad is able to experience a vision that is preceded by a sound: :When down the stormy crescent goes, :A light before me swims, :Between dark stems the forest glows, :I hear a noise of hymns: :Then by some secret shrine I ride; :I hear a voice but none are there; (lines 25‚Äì30) This vision includes three angels with the Holy Grail:Shaw 1976 p. 203 :Three angels bear the holy Grail: :With folded feet, in stoles of white, :On sleeping wings they sail. :Ah, blessed vision! blood of God! :My spirit beats her mortal bars, :As down dark tides the glory slides, :And star-like mingles with the stars. (lines 42‚Äì48) Galahad continues by comparing the vision to light clothed in drapery: :A maiden knight-to me is given :Such hope, I know not fear; :I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven :That often meet me here. :I muse on joy that will not cease, :Pure spaces clothed in living beams, :Pure lilies of eternal peace, :Whose odours haunt my dreams; (lines 61‚Äì68) Themes In In Memoriam, Tennyson suggests that the supernatural has to be partly known and partly unknown. In order to incorporate this idea into his poetry, Tennyson relies on a series of different characters who serve as filters to visions of truth. These characters appear in many of Tennyson's poems, with the figure of Galahad being the one who is most capable of understanding the visions. In Galahad's case, his vision is of the Holy Grail, which contains images similar to those in \\"The Holy Grail\\" in Idylls of the King. In \\"The Holy Grail\\", Bors and Lancelot as well as Galahad receive visions. Of the three, Galahad is the one who best understands his abilities and his sins, and his strength allows him to complete his quest.Shaw 1976 pp. 202‚Äì204 In terms of differences between \\"Sir Galahad\\" and \\"The Holy Grail\\", \\"Sir Galahad\\" depicts Galahad as prideful in regards to his abilities and to his purity, whereas \\"The Holy Grail\\" emphasizes that Galahad is both pious and grimly determined. Furthermore, the rhythm of \\"Sir Galahad\\" is almost cheerful, whereas \\"The Holy Grail\\" is melancholic. \\"The Holy Grail\\" incorporates a passage in which King Arthur begs his knights not to quest because he knows that most of them will not return. In the event, the quest does indeed mark the end of the Round Table. In the end, only Galahad is capable of completing the Grail Quest, while many of the knights are killed.Epperly 1992 pp. 105‚Äì106 As with \\"The Lady of Shalott\\", \\"Morte d'Arthur\\", and other poems, Tennyson incorporates technical aspects of \\"Sir Galahad\\" into Idylls of the King. The aspects that are drawn from \\"Sir Galahad\\" are the same as those taken from \\"Morte d'Arthur\\": the use of ritual. This addition allows Tennyson to create a long poem that relies on a variety of styles while containing artistic value.Shaw 1976 pp. 222, 274 However, Idylls of the King varies in terms of meter and tone from \\"Sir Galahad\\", as the former is blank verse and the latter is a mixture of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.

It has approximately 3,600 members, including veterans from the regiment's founding in 1942. Association membership is open to current and former members of the 506th and their families, current and former members of units attached to or supporting the 506th, and others with a special connection or association with the 506th.  Organization and status  The association was incorporated in California in 2000 and became a non-profit organization in 2001. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service recognized the association as a Section 501(c)(19) War Veterans organization.IRS veterans organizations The association sponsors academic scholarships, packages for soldiers deployed overseas, and financial assistance programs for the families of soldiers killed or wounded in action. The association is an all-volunteer organization with about 3,600 rostered members. It operates independently of the 101st Airborne Division Association, but maintains close working relations with that group and with other related veterans‚Äô organizations. The association holds member reunions every two years around the United States.  Motto  The association's motto ‚Äî We stand together ‚Äì then, now and always ‚Äî is derived from the regimental motto of Currahee! ‚Äì Cherokee language for ‚ÄúStand Alone,‚Äù. This is the name of the mountain in the World War II paratrooper training center at Camp Toccoa, Georgia. The name Currahee also designates members and former members of the regiment.  History  In fall 1995, two Vietnam War veterans from the 506th ‚Äî Bob Acklen (B&C;, 3rd Bn-1969/70) and Gene Overton (C, 1st Bn-1967/68) ‚Äî began gathering contact information of former Currahees. They wanted to facilitate communication among Currahees, to interact with active duty troops preserve the regimental history, and to honor the deceased. In December 1995, Acklen and Overton mailed the first newsletter to about 450 Currahees . By May 1996, the mailing list had grown to 800 Currahees . On July 11 to 13, 1996, a gathering of Vietnam-era Currahees was held at Fort Campbell, Kentucky About 88 Currahees attended the event This reunion was the first significant event to involve all generations of Currahees, At that reunion, 53 Currahees attended an organizational meeting to discuss forming a veterans' group for their regiment. The decision was to move forward, and four veterans were tasked with researching it. Since most of the Currahees at the Fort Campbell meeting were from the Airborne Battle Group era or Vietnam era, the question was whether Currahees from the World War II era would be interested in joining the proposed association. Association representatives attended the 101st Airborne Division Association's 1996 Reunion in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 8‚Äì10, 1996. After the representatives present their proposal to the 40 to 50 World War II era Currahees there, they received a positive response. The decision was made to open the association for all Curahees. Organizational meetings were held at reunions in 1997 and 1998. At the latter event, the first organizational elections were held. A board of directors and association officers were elected . The 1997 Currahee Veterans Reunion in Knoxville, Tennessee, included 68 Currahees. The largest group was 39 from the World War II era, followed by 25 troopers from the Vietnam era.  Programs  The Currahee website came online in November 1996. It soon evolved from a communication vehicle into a website of historic and contemporary documents, pictures and maps, 4,000 pages of information and 3,000 photographs and maps. It has 60,000 visitors a year. The association also publishes a newsletter The Currahee! and a Currahee blog. The Quartermaster function was created to sell Currahee-marked apparel, flags and mementos. These sales are a strong revenue source for the association. The 506th regiment was deployed abroad during the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, and for peacekeeping in South Korea. In response, the association started new assistance programs for soldiers and their families. In the period from 2004 to 2009, association awarded scholarships, grants and unit support of more than $55,000.506th Assoc Report, 2009. The principal award programs are: *A scholarship program to Currahees and their children. This Scholarship Fund was established with seed money from SFC(R) Joseph F. Foster, Jr. (HHC, 2nd Bn, 1969‚Äì70) and SSG(R) Melissa D. Snock (Associate Member). *Financial assistance to wounded vets and the survivors of those killed in action. The Widows, Orphans and Wounded Soldiers (WOWS) fund was established by a gift from Thomas G. Lee (CSC, 1st Bn, 1987‚Äì88). *The Packages program sent \\"CARE\\" packages of morale-building food and relaxation materials for troops on combat assignments. *Unit recognition programs distributed flags and other symbols of support to combat units..http://www.506infantry.org/images2/helwigarticle.jpg *Currahee veterans have visited wounded veterans in hospitals *Other Currahee veterans have attended graveside ceremonies for Currahees killed in action. The association also provides the following services: *Facilitating communication between Currahees who have lost track of each other. *Enabling Currahees to gain needed closure about the combat death of a loved one by communicating with their fellow soldiers; these, in turn, are finally able to share with the families of lost friends their feelings and sympathies. * Providing confirmations of service for Currahees who are trying to qualify for veterans benefits, but are missing documentation. *Research material for students and scholars on the 506th regiment. The association has an active link to the units deployed in South Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan as the association's Active Duty/Veteran Liaison. The association is providing financial backing of the Currahee Rendezvous '09. It has also been raising funds to build a monument to the over 1400 soldiers of the regiment who have been killed in action.

In German  In German, the term Hochdeutschland to mean Alpine Germany was not uncommon in the 16th century, and was still so used by the Brothers Grimm in the 19th, but has largely fallen out of use. However, when the Republic of Austria was founded in 1918, Hochdeutschland was one of the proposals made for a name for the new country.

The adjective hochdeutsch, meaning Southern German, is most commonly used in the context of language: High German refers to all dialects of the German language spoken south of the Benrath line. However, since the standard German language grew mostly out of a High German dialect, modern colloquial German often uses the word Hochdeutsch to mean official language as opposed to any dialect (even those dialects which linguists call \\"high German\\"). As a result, the nouns Hochdeutscher and Hochdeutschland can occasionally be heard in German used jokingly to refer to the political establishment, or to the region around Hannover which is often associated with the standard language, despite belonging to the traditional Low German area and having an appropriate Northern regiolect.  In English  In English, the term High Germany is rather dated as a geographical term, but it is still familiar from the traditional song \\"High Germany\\", which refers to the War of the Spanish Succession:  See also  * High German * High Germany (folk song)  References  Category:Geographic history of Germany ","title":"High Germany"},{"id":"24086006","text":"Samuel Andrew Britton (born 10 February 1988) is an Irish cricketer.

He became legendary when he managed to bring down an enemy bomber by ramming its tail, on November 2, 1940. Career Mitralexis graduated as a Second Lieutenant from the Hellenic Air Force Academy in summer 1940. In the following Greek-Italian War (October 28, 1940 to April 7, 1941), he was posted to the 22nd Pursuit Squadron, based on the airfield of Thessaloniki. On November 2, a squadron of 15 Italian CANT Z.1007 bombers, with Fiat CR.42 fighter escorts, headed towards Thessaloniki. Soon they were spotted and intercepted by Greek PZL P.24 fighters of the 22nd Squadron. During the dogfights, three of the bombers were shot down, while the rest reached their targets, and then started to return to their base in Albania. Mitralexis, who had already shot down one bomber, was now out of ammunition, so he aimed the nose of his PZL P. 24 right into an enemy bomber's tail, smashing the rudder and sending the bomber out of control. He then had to make an emergency landing near the crashed bomber. Having landed, Mitralexis captured the four surviving crew members of the enemy aircraft using his pistol. For this extraordinary feat, Mitralexis was promoted and awarded a number of medals, including Greece's highest award for bravery, the Gold Cross of Valour. He was the only Air Force officer to be awarded it during the war. When Greece capitulated to Germany (April 1941) he and the rest of the surviving Greek Air Force personnel and aircraft escaped to North Africa to join the Allied forces there. In September 1948, during a routine training flight in an Airspeed Oxford, he died crashing in the south Aegean Sea. Legacy A PZL P.24, the main Greek fighter in the Greco-Italian War At the outbreak of the Greek- Italian War on 28 October 1940, the Greek Air Force was severely outnumbered, counting only 79 aircraft against the 380 fighters and bombers available to the Italian Regia Aeronautica. Mitralexis' feat boosted Greek morale, being depicted in several artists' impressions, in newspapers and magazines, as well as on a postage stamp. It propelled Mitralexis to the status of a war hero, eclipsing his subsequent war record of 5 kills. A statue of him is erected in Ellinikon, Athens.

The New York Communist was a short-lived weekly newspaper issued by the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party of Local Greater New York, encompassing the New York City metro area. The paper was edited by the radical journalist and war correspondent John Reed. Only 10 issues of the paper were produced during 1919 before the publication was absorbed by The Revolutionary Age following the Left Wing National Conference of June 1919. History According to a declaration in its inaugural issue, no doubt written by editor John Reed, \\"thousands of members\\" of the Left Wing Section living in New York City were engaged in \\"fighting for control of the local Party machinery, against a fierce and unscrupulous resistance by the petty politicians who direct the Party machine.\\" While noting enormous contributions to this movement made by the long-established Left Wing weekly of the Left Wing Section of Local Boston, The Revolutionary Age, \\"as long as the entire machinery is not in our hands, a New York is essential,\\" Reed declared.\\"Why the New York Communist?\\" The New York Communist. v. 1, no. 1 (April 19, 1919), pg. 2. For the next 10 weeks, Reed's newspaper documented one of the most ferocious factional struggles in the history of the Socialist Party of America, a veritable war marked by arbitrary dissolutions of party units, lockouts from facilities, and takeovers of scheduled meetings. This blow-by-blow coverage which makes The New York Communist one of the most important primary sources for historians studying the process of formation of the American Communist movement during the tumultuous year of 1919. According to historian James Weinstein: Editor John Reed was assisted in his task by associate editor Eadmonn MacAlpine. Business manager of the publication at its launch was Maximilian Cohen, the Executive Secretary of the Left Wing Section of Local Greater New York. Cohen was succeeded in this role by Benjamin Gitlow effective with the June 14 issue.Participants were listed on the masthead of each issue, located at the top left corner of page 2. Each issue of the paper consisted of 8 pages in each issue and bore a cover price of 5 cents per copy. No sooner had the second edition of The New York Communist appeared when David P. Berenberg, a party regular affiliated with the Rand School of Social Science, launched a new factional document from the other side of the debate, mockingly entitled The New York Socialist. The publication adopted the jeering tone of Reed's publication and matched The New York Communist blow-for-blow in terms of personal invective, albeit concentrating its fire on the Left Wing insurgents as \\"an enemy ... within our ranks.\\"Granville Hicks with John Stuart, John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary. New York: Macmillan, 1936; page 349. This new rival proved to be too tempting a target for the sophomorish Reed to ignore. On May 17, The New York Socialist appeared as usual at the Rand School. It was not until several thousand issues had been distributed that it was discovered that the document being distributed was an exact replica of Berenberg's publication created by Reed and MacAlpine. The parody issue prominently featured a speech purported to have been delivered by leader of the Regular faction Louis Waldman on April Fool's Day. In this mock speech, Waldman portrayed as attacking the Left Wing with the words: > So evident is their intention to disrupt the party that it has been > necessary to expel all Left Wing branches and exclude the members from any > vote on party affairs. If this is not disrupting the party, what is?Hicks > and Stuart, John Reed, page 350.

It became a junction station in 1890 upon the opening of the Blenheim and Woodstock Branch Line, and served the area for over 100 years before falling victim to the programme of closures initiated by the Beeching Report in 1964. Following many proposals for its reopening, a new station to serve Kidlington opened in October 2015 at on the Oxford to Bicester Line. History  Opening  Although the Oxford and Rugby Railway opened in 1850, it was a further two years before the Brunelian station building was completed. Originally named Woodstock Road, the station was inconveniently-sited at the northern end of Kidlington, around 20 minutes walk from the village centre. The station, a conventional two-platform stopping place with modest goods facilities, defied the railway convention that station buildings were usually sited on the platform nearest the settlement that they were purporting to serve. In this case, Kidlington village was to the east, whereas the station buildings were constructed on the western side, leaving the station effectively back-to-front. This can apparently be explained by the fact that the station was opened to serve Woodstock and not Kidlington, then a small village of around 2,400 inhabitants clustered around a church located over away from the station. Goods facilities When originally opened, the station was provided with a small goods yard and run-round loop for goods traffic on the down side. In addition, it was likely that two sidings had been installed: one to serve the loading dock to the rear of the down platform, and one connected to a goods shed of typical Great Western Railway design. The by shed was constructed out of yellowish brickwork and had five bays with brick pilasters. Towards the end of the 19th century, the goods yard siding was extended across the station approach to serve a timber yard which had opened to the west of the station. This arrangement not only blocked passengers' access to the ticket office when wagons were being shunted, but also blocked all means of entry to the timber yard. An additional siding was therefore laid to provide a bypass for the shed which effectively put it on a short loop. Another siding was laid across the road in 1923 when Oxford Farmers Ltd opened a bacon factory. Passenger facilities A 1902 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Kidlington Built in 1855, Kidlington was one of a group of six stations constructed during this period (the others being , , , and Aynho) whose architectural features appeared to distinguish them from other GWR stations. However, upon closer inspection they all were constructed with Cotswold rather than Italianate features. Kidlington resembled on the Cornish Main Line, but its hipped roof and larger canopy made it seem at first glance very different. Substantial station buildings constructed out of local oolitic limestone were provided on both platforms. The larger of the two was the down building, crowned by three tall Italianate chimneys, which comprised a waiting room, ladies' waiting room and ladies' toilet. The up building was much smaller but similar in size and contained a large waiting room, the booking hall, a parcels office, the stationmaster's office, a porter's room and a gents' toilet. A canopied passenger footbridge was added at the turn of the 19th century. Both platforms had picturesque gardens, complete with rustic arches and flower baskets. When Kidlington became a junction station in 1890 upon the opening of the Blenheim and Woodstock Branch Line, a bay platform was constructed alongside the country end of the down platform on the alignment of a former goods siding. The down platform itself was extended north towards the Banbury Road bridge to allow sufficient room for terminating branch services. The station was also renamed Kidlington to avoid confusion with the new station. Decline and closure By the 1950s, rationalisation and cuts in the frequency of services led to passengers alighting at Kidlington having to wait two hours for a connecting train to Oxford. Passenger numbers had fallen from 23,000 in the 1930s to less than 9,000 in 1952, with each train carrying on average 5 to 6 passengers, and sometimes even running empty. In Kidlington, due to the inconvenient siting of the station, villagers preferred the more convenient bus services to Oxford. British Railways closed the Blenheim and Woodstock Branch Line in 1954, leaving Kidlington to survive for a further ten years with a service of around six trains a day. The new housing developments in the village were situated on its southern side and the new occupants also preferred local bus services to Oxford rather than walk the to the station. It was therefore no surprise when Kidlington was listed for closure in the Beeching Report together with , and . A reprieve was given by the Government to Tackley and Heyford, but Bletchington and Kidlington closed in November 1964, despite it being the largest village on the Cherwell Valley Line between Oxford and Banbury.. Present day  Remains  After closure, Kidlington station was used by a printing firm although the up buildings and platform were demolished. By 1973, all that remained was the down building and goods shed. The shed was at that time occupied by a plastics firm, whilst the parcels office was an antique shop and the booking office had become a denture repairers. The signal box was demolished in 1970. The passenger footbridge was taken down and re-erected near Didcot North Junction where it replaced a similar bridge which had been badly damaged following a derailment. The goods shed was demolished in 1984 and most of the surrounding goods yard is now occupied by an industrial estate known as The Station Field. The connection with the former Woodstock branch has been obscured by deep ballasting on the main line. Proposed new stations Roundham Level Crossing, once considered as the site of a new Kidlington station. There have been calls since the 1970s for the reopening of Kidlington station as a Park and ride facility for local commuters. The new station should, it was proposed, be reopened on a site closer to the village centre, such as Roundham Lane Crossing. The idea was enthusiastically received by British Rail, which called for the scheme to be backed by financial contributions from local authorities. These were not forthcoming and the land earmarked for the station was redeveloped, leaving insufficient room for an approach road and car park. Since the 1980s, Oxfordshire County Council has advocated a new Kidlington station on the Cherwell Valley Line on land beside Lyne Road between Flatford Place and Thorne Close. Train operating company Chiltern Railways constructed a new station on the Oxford to Bicester Line just south of Kidlington as part of its Project Evergreen 3 development programme.Chiltern Railways: Project Evergreen 3 Located at , near the site of the former , the station opened in October 2015. In January 2017, the council called plans for an 'Oxford Metro' as part of the Oxford station upgrade which would allow this to happen and could include a new station at Kidlington.

They are caloric restriction mimetic compounds that may be helpful in treating various aging-related diseases. Context Leonard P. Guarente is recognized as the leading proponent of the hypothesis that caloric restriction slows aging by activation of Sirtuins. STACs have been discovered by Konrad Howitz of Biomol Inc and biologist David Sinclair. In September 2003, Howitz and Sinclair et al. published a highly cited paper reporting that polyphenols such as resveratrol activate human SIRT1 and extend the lifespan of budding yeast (Howitz et al., Nature, 2003). Other examples of such products are butein, piceatannol, isoliquiritigenin, fisetin, and quercetin. Some STACs can cause artificial effects in the assay initially used for their identification, but it has been shown that STACs also activate SIRT1 against regular polypeptide substrates, with an influence of the substrate sequence. Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, Sinclair's company, was purchased by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 2008, and subsequently shut down as a separate entity within GSK.

He then hangs out at Harry's apartment, discussing the upcoming Fall Formal, until he receives an e-mail from J. Jonah Jameson of the Daily Bugle informing Peter that Jonah wants to purchase his photos of Spider-Man. He leaves and promises to help Harry with homework later. At the Bugle building, Jonah mistakenly kicks Peter out before realizing who he is. Jonah pays him and makes him exit the building. While heading back, Peter hears an alarm coming from a landfill and investigates. It ends up being a trap and he is attacked with sonic blasts by Montana, now wearing the suit and calling himself \\"Shocker\\". When he is close to moving in for the kill, one of the thugs used as bait, Alex O'Hirn, accidentally gives Spider-Man time to recover. Shocker then knocks him into a machine and, satisfied, leaves via helicopter. Spider-Man, however, survives but his paycheck was torn to shreds. The next day after school, where Harry is outraged with him over missing out on studying, Peter goes to replace his check at the Bugle where assistant editor Joe Robertson suggests getting a better camera. After Jonah takes a photo of Spider-Man covered in garbage as Peter's submission, Peter goes after O'Hirn and his partner Flint Marko as Spider-Man. He defeats them and tells them to inform Shocker he wants a rematch. Peter makes it home in time for his curfew and spots Aunt May struggling with the bills, but must use the money he has to buy a new camera. When he goes to school the next day, he finds Harry is furious with him once more over forgetting their studying arrangements once more. At night, Hammerhead tells Shocker the Big Man is displeased with his failure. Meanwhile, Peter unsuccessfully tries to ask out Jonah's assistant, Betty Brant. After a tremor rattles the entire city, Peter, as Spider-Man, discovers it is the Shocker, leaving him a trail that leads to a condemned theater. During their fight, Spider-Man unsuccessfully tries to find out who hired him before finally bringing the building down and defeating the Shocker. Meanwhile, Harry returns home where his father Norman tells him to take responsibility and study by himself. Norman then goes to meet with Hammerhead, revealing that he helped them steal the suit from Tri-Corp as they are his company's competitor. He talks over speaker phone with the Big Man, who wants him to create new supervillains in return for funding. At his house, Peter sends his photos to the Bugle and tries to give Aunt May the money, but she insists that he uses 10% of every paycheck to save for a new camera. Production \\"Market Forces\\" was written by Andrew Robinson and directed by Dan Fausett. Though the show is done in the style of traditional animation, computer-generated imagery was used to produce the green sonic beams made by Shocker. In the original comic book publications, Shocker's secret identity was a man named Herman Schultz. For The Spectacular Spider-Man, they changed his identity to that of Enforcer Montana, who had, in the comics, been a prominent character already. Using Montana allowed the writers to not have to come up with a completely new origin for Shocker. His suit was generally the same as that done in the comic books, but had extra features including goggles and vibrators. His voice was provided by veteran voice performer Jeff Bennett. Cultural references Greg Weisman, one of the producers for the series, came up with the idea to do a title scheme for each arc. For \\"Market Forces\\" and its arc, the scheme is economics. A line in the episode asks how deep a location is, using the Mariana Trench and the Ninth Circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno as comparisons. Reception \\"Market Forces\\" originally broadcast on March 26, 2008, on the Kids WB! block for the CW Network, at 10:00 a.m. It received generally positive reviews from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10 and wrote \\"Sometimes change can be fun, and this episode was a great example of that.\\" Goldman enjoyed the design of Shocker which he felt stayed true to his original design and was \\"intrigued\\" by changing his secret identity. He praised the usage of CGI, the portrayal of Peter's life, and the \\"cool\\" ending. Sean Elliot, the senior editor of iF Magazine, gave the episode an \\"A-\\" and said about the change of Shocker's secret identity, \\"saves the writers from having to come up with a completely different origin for a character that pretty much is a second tier villain anyways. \\" Elliot wrote that having Norman making a deal to produce new supervillains was \\"an extremely useful\\" convention that allows the introduction and creation of enemies for Spider-Man to fight.

He is revered as a saint by the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Catholic Church. Life Peter was born and raised in Alexandria. The Coptic Orthodox Church believes that Peter was given by his parents to Theonas to be brought up as a priest, similarly to the story of Samuel in the Old Testament. He rose through the ranks of holy orders, first becoming a reader, then a deacon, then a priest. Highly educated, Peter became head of the school of Alexandria.Dumitra≈ücu, Iulian. \\"Hieromartyr Clement, pope of Rome; Hieromartyr Peter, archbishop of Alexandria\\", Basilica.Ro., November 24, 2017 In early 300, while on his death bed, Theonas advised the church leaders to choose Peter as his successor, which they did. Peter's time as bishop included the severe persecution of Christianity from Roman Emperor Diocletian, which began in 303, and continued intermittently over the next ten years. Forced into exile from the city during the anti-Christian persecutions, Peter traveled through many lands, encouraging his flock by letter, before returning to his city to guide the Alexandrian Church personally during this period. He secretly visited those imprisoned, assisted widows and orphans, and conducted clandestine services. Accounts of Peter's position during the persecution vary,Philip Schaff's History of the Christian Church provides several differing sources on the subject. Volume II: Ante-Nicene Christianity. A.D. 100-325. but one states that he was imprisoned for a time with bishop Meletius of Lycopolis and they fell into an argument over the treatment of Christians who had either offered pagan sacrifice or surrendered scriptures to the authorities to save their lives during the persecution. Peter urged leniency while Meletius held firmly that the lapsed had abandoned their faith and needed to be rebaptised. Their argument became heated, and was ended when Peter hung a curtain between him and Meletius. One of Meletius' followers was a priest named Arius (modern scholarship differs on whether this was the same Arius as became involved with the Arian controversy a few years later).Rubenstein, Richard E. (1999). When Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome, Harcourt. The text links the current suggestions of only one Arius being involved, rather than two people of that name, to the work of W. H. C. Frend in Rise of Christianity, p. 493; see p. 245. According to Severus of Ashmumeen, Arius tried in vain to receive absolution from the Patriarch before Peter was executed, and before dying Peter anathematized Arius as a heretic and excommunicated him. The execution of the patriarch Peter of Alexandria under the emperor Maximinus Daia, depicted in the Menologion of Basil II, an illuminated manuscript prepared for the emperor Basil II in .  Martyrdom  The tenth-century historian Severus of Ashmumeen gives us an account of how during the Diocletianic Persecution the Patriarch was seized and thrown in prison. When the emperor was informed about this, he ordered Peter to be beheaded. This was hindered by a large number of Christians who gathered at the prison willing to die for their Patriarch. The soldiers delayed the execution because they neither wanted to massacre the crowd nor create a riot. The Patriarch, fearing for the life of his people, advised the soldiers with a plan to smuggle him out of jail by breaking a hole in a certain wall which he would point out. He could then be smuggled out and receive his sentence. Severus of Ashmumeen describes the moment when the Patriarch was martyred: > And he took off his omophorion, and bared his neck, which was pure before > the Lord, and said to them: ¬´Do as you have been commanded¬ª. But the > soldiers feared that trouble would befall them because of him. So they > looked one at another, and not one of them dared to cut off his head, > because of the dread which had fallen upon them. Then they took counsel > together and said: ¬´To him that cuts off his head each one of us will give > five denarii¬ª. Now they were six persons; and one of them had some money; so > he took out five and twenty denarii from among the coins and said : ¬´He that > will go up to him, and cut off his head, shall receive this money from me > and from the four others¬ª. So one of the men went forward, and summoned up > his courage, and cut off the head of the holy martyr and patriarch Peter; > that day being the 29th of Hatur. Hatur is a month in the Coptic calendar, corresponding roughly to November. Saint Peter's martyrdom occurred in the year AD 311\\\\. Feast day Traditionally, in Christianity, the day of a saint's death is the day on which his feast day is celebrated. 29 Hatur corresponds to 25 November in the Julian calendar (to 26 November if the following Julian year is a leap year). Thus 29 Hatur corresponds at present to the Gregorian Calendar 8 December or 9 December (see Old Style and New Style dates).

The sport appears to have originated in the West Country of England in the 1970s, and rapidly became a popular activity at village f√™tes and fundraising events across Britain. The sport is now played in many different countries, including Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Russia. Rules Depending on local custom, different rules are applied to the sport. In parts of Somerset, for example, the boot is filled with water before being thrown. Some competitions allow a run up before releasing the boot, while others require the throw to be made from a standing position‚Äîwhich may be enforced by making the thrower stand in an empty dustbin. In Welbury, North Yorkshire, the size of the boot thrown must be large enough to comfortably fit the thrower. Other competitions specify the size of the boot and the manufacturer. Associations A number of associations have been formed to govern the sport, including the International Boot Throwing Association (based in Helsinki, Finland), the World Welly Wanging Association (Upperthong, UK), the World Welly Throwing Association (Settle, UK), the World Wellington Boot Throwing Association (Wellington, UK) and the New Zealand Boot Throwing Association (Taihape, New Zealand). Records The first world record throw recognised by Guinness World Records was , set by Tony Rodgers in Wiltshire, UK, in 1978, using a size 8 Dunlop \\"Challenger\\" boot. The current world records are for men, set by Teppo Luoma of Finland in 1996, and for women set by Sari Tirkkon, also of Finland and also in 1996. Gumboot day Gumboot Monument at the entrance to Taihape Gumboot Day is a native celebration of Taihape, New Zealand. It occurs the Tuesday after Easter, and has been a regular event since 1985. It is a celebration of all things to do with gumboots, and includes the gumboot throwing contest. The aim of the festival is to break the world record for the longest gumboot throw. It is a family event, which includes a number of other competitions such as the best-dressed gumboot and ‚Äòshoot the loop‚Äô with gumboots. Gumboots can also be tossed skyward on any day of the year in the official Gumboot throwing lane located in the 'Outback', just behind Taihape's main shopping centre.

Career Topel was born in ƒ∞zmit on September 2, 1934 to Hakkƒ± Bey, a tobacco expert from Trabzon and Mebuse Hanƒ±m in ƒ∞zmit, where his father was working for the Turkish tobacco company Tekel. He was the third sibling of four children. Cengiz Topel was schooled in Bandƒ±rma and G√∂nen of Balƒ±kesir Province. He finished the primary and the secondary school in Kadƒ±k√∂y, ƒ∞stanbul, where his family moved following his father's death. After a brief time at Haydarpa≈üa High School, he entered Kuleli Military High School, from which he graduated in 1953. Cengiz Topel joined the Army in 1955 with the rank of a second lieutenant following his education at the Turkish Military Academy. His interest in aviation took him to the Turkish Air Force. He was sent to Canada for flight training. In 1957, he returned to Turkey and was appointed to the 5th Air Wing in Merzifon Air Base. Cengiz Topel served from 1961 on at the 1st Tactical Air Force Command at Eski≈üehir Air Base. In 1963, he became an Air Force captain. Combat mission On August 8, 1964, Topel was appointed to a combat mission during Turkey's military intervention during the Battle of Tylliria. He led a four-fighter flight of the 112th Air Squadron leaving Eski≈üehir Air Base around 17:00 local time for Cyprus. Topel's F-100 Super Sabre was hit by 40mm anti-aircraft fire from a Greek Cypriot gun emplacement and shot-down as he was strafing the Arion, a Greek Cypriot patrol boat. He was able to eject from his aircraft and made a safe parachute jump over land. He was promptly captured and brought to a hospital. However, members of the Cyprus National Guard allegedly took him from the hospital to their headquarters at Kykkos Monastery. An autopsy of his body showed that he was heavily tortured and his corpse was shot afterwards. His corpse was returned on August 12, 1964 to the Turkish authorities only after insistent attempts.

His lumber schooners were built in or near Eureka, California in shipyards on Humboldt Bay for over 30 years. These schooners played a major role in the historic west coast lumber trade. Background Hans Ditlev Bendixsen was born in Thisted of Region Nordjylland, Denmark, the son of Frederik Carl Bendixsen, a tobacco merchant and Mariane von Mehren Bendixsen, both members of prominent Danish families. Bendixsen was apprenticed to the shipbuilders' trade in Aalborg for two years, When he had completed his apprenticeship he worked at various shipyards in Copenhagen, after which he went to sea as a ship carpenter.Master Shipbuilder Hans Ditlev Bendixsen (Ships used in the 1935 MGM Gable & Laughton version of Mutiny on the Bounty) Career Bendixsen came to California via Cape Horn, and found employment in Turner's shipyard, at San Francisco, until the year 1867, at which time he came to Eureka, California. He entered the employ of E. Cousins' shipyard, prior to beginning shipbuilding independently. From Eureka, Mr. Bendixsen removed his shipyard to nearby Fairhaven, California. Spread out over fourteen acres were shops, sawmills, slips, timber yards, even cottages and gardens for 150 workers.Dog Holes And Wire Chutes (Jevne Haugan in \\"Maritime Life and Traditions\\" .

Thayer lumber schooner built by Hans Ditlev Bendixsen Often, Bendixsen owned shares in Bendixsen- built ships‚Äîvessels plying the coast with lumber or trading out to the sugar islands. After many good years an economic crisis within the lumber industry in 1877 forced Bendixsen to sell his shipyard so that he could pay his employees and creditors. He rented the shipyard from the new owners and continued to build ships. Seven years later he was able to buy back the shipyard. Between 1875 and 1901 he launched 50 three and four-mast schooners and barkentines at his Fairhaven yard, and in his lifetime built some 115 vessels of all types including two-mast schooners, South Sea schooner and brigantines, and steamboats. Bendixsen is best remembered for the three, four, and five-mast schooners he built for the west coast lumber trade. In 1901 he sold his shipbuilding plant for close to a quarter of a million of dollars. Legacy Certain of Bendixsen's lumber schooners have survived into the 21st century.

It is calculated by the following formula: :Supply chain surplus = Revenue generated from a customer - Total cost incurred to produce and deliver the product.Sunil, C. and Meindl, P. (2012) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning and Operation. 5th edn. Essex: Pearson Education. Definition and Example Supply chain surplus, also known as supply chain profitability, is a common term that represents value addition by supply chain function of an organization. Jonathan Birkin also defines supply chain surplus as \\"the difference between the revenue generated from the customers and the overall cost across that supply chain.\\"Birkin, J. (2012) Business Advantage Intermediate Teacher's Book. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 55. The operational concept of it is 'sharing the profit that remains after subtracting costs incurred in the production and delivery of products or services. Ideally, profit is distributed to supply chain partners via transfer prices.'Huffman, A.H. and Klein, S.R. (2013) Green Organizations. New York: Routledge. pp. 131. For example, a consumer buys a PC from Samsung at $2,500, which indicates the revenue supply chain achieved. All the stages incur costs to ensure the efficient transfer of funds, information, storage of the product and transportation to the final consumer. The difference between revenue from selling the PC and the supply chain cost represents the supply chain surplus or supply chain profitability. Supply chain surplus is the total profit shared by all the stages and intermediaries. The greater the supply chain surplus, the more successful the supply chain. The success of supply chain calculated by its overall surplus not by the profit at each part of stages.MBA Lectures. (2010) The objective of a supply chain, 23 November [Online]. Available at: http://mba-lectures.com/supply-chain/1113/the-objective-of-a-supply-chain.html (Accessed: 26 October 2014) Formula Supply chain surplus can be calculated by the following formulae: :Supply chain surplus = Revenue generated from a customer - Total cost incurred to produce and deliver the product. :Supply chain surplus = Customer Value - Supply Chain Cost.Sunil, C. and Meindl, P. (2012) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning and Operation. 5th edn. Essex: Pearson Education. These terms were coined by Sunil Chopra, of the Kellogg School of Management and Peter Meindl, of Kepos Capital. Maximising surplus Maximising supply chain surplus is an ultimate objective of the supply chain planning. When we look the amount of supply chain surplus, the success of that supply chain system and its future prospects can be known.Bansal, J.C., Singh, P.K., Deep, K., Pant, M. and Nagar, A.K. (2013) Proceedings of Seventh International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA 2012). New Delhi: Springer India. To maximise supply chain surplus, every facility that impacts costs must be considered.Shah, J. (2009) Supply Chain Management: Text and Cases. New Delhi: Dorlling Kindersley. However, Hugos said that, among those, 'the customer must be the starting point when trying to increase the supply chain surplus because all demand, and therefore revenue, ultimately arises from them.'Hugos, M.H. (2011) Essentials of Supply Chain Management. 3rd edn. New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons. Traceability and Transparency According to Pagell et al., supply chain surplus is related to sustainability and can be further understood through the practices of traceability and transparency. Traceability is 'the practice of sharing information among supply chain partners about materials that meet industry standards for minimising environmental risk', and Transparency is 'the flow of money through the entire supply chain with an explicit goal of ensuring that each organisation makes enough of a profit to do more than just subsist'. In essence, traceability is concerned with how things are made throughout the chain while transparency is concerned with keeping profits flowing through the entire chain. To maximise surplus, it is important to ensure continuity of the supply chain system by letting each partner in the chain reinvest, innovate, and grow.Pagell, M. and Wu, Z. (2009) 'Building a more complete theory of sustainable supply chain management using case studies of 10 exemplars', The Journal of Supply Chain Management, 45(2), pp. 37-56. Outsourcing By aggregating capacity, inventory, inbound or outbound transportation, warehousing, procurement, information, receivables to higher level, outsourcing to a third party can provide a sustainable growth of the surplus to the firm. Sometimes, a growth in surplus may also occur due to lower cost, higher quality, specialization or learning of the third party. A firm gains most from outsourcing to a third party if needs are small, uncertainty is high and other firms are also sourcing from the same third party.Sayeed, M.

Available at: http://schain24.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/sourcing-decisions-and-third-party.html (Accessed: 24 October 2014) Tax efficient management To maximise supply chain surplus, the effect of tax in the design and implementation of supply chain management is also considered. As the result of globalization, now there are so many cross-national businesses. As different countries have different tax rates, companies may legally optimise their supply chain and increase profits based on tax efficiency.Branch, A.E.

Biography He was born to French parents in Geneva, Switzerland. After studying in his native town, Tirard became a civil engineer. After five years of government service he resigned to become a jewel merchant. His determined opposition to the empire, culminating in 1869 in a campaign in favour of the radical candidate opposed to Ollivier, was rewarded by his election as mayor of the 11th arrondissement of Paris and as deputy for the Seine. Nominated a member of the Commune, he protested against the tyranny of the central committee, and escaped from Paris to resume his place among the extreme Left in the National Assembly at Versailles. In 1876 he was returned for the 1st arrondissement of Paris to the Chamber of Deputies, and was re- elected next year. He specially devoted himself to finance, being for a short time president of the customs commission before his appointment as minister of agriculture and commerce in March 1879 in the Waddington cabinet. He held the same portfolio in the first Freycinet ministry (1879‚Äì1880) and in the Jules Ferry cabinet (1880‚Äì1881). He was minister of commerce in Freycinet's second cabinet (1882), of finance under E Duclerc (1882‚Äì1883), and under A Falli√®res (1883), retaining the same office in the second Jules Ferry ministry (1883‚Äì1885). When Carnot became president of the Republic in 1887 he asked Tirard to form a ministry. He had to deal with the Wilson scandal which had led to President Jules Gr√©vy's downfall, and with the revisionist agitation of General Boulanger. His refusal to proceed to the revision of the constitution of 1875 led to his defeat on 30 March 1888. He returned to power next year, and decided to bring Boulanger and his chief supporters before the High Court, but the general's flight effectively settled the question.

History The hospital was initially founded in 1889 with the founding of the town. Back then, it was built on land measuring about northeast of Kuala Lumpur. The hospital grew with the development of Kajang town and Hulu Langat district. The hospital had 250 beds in the 1970s and this has increased to 306 beds currently. The hospital has gradually increased its number of buildings. The first permanent building which still stands till now was constructed in 1910. Another 4-storey block was added in 1976. Other blocks later added include the Food preparation block (1983), the morgue (1985) and the pathology unit (1992). The latest building addition was carried out under the Hospital Redevelopment Project Phase 2, which was completed in 1999. The construction cost RM14.1 million and was funded by the Asian Development Bank. The building consists of 1st and 2nd class labour wards (22 beds), neonatal unit (20 beds), Operating Theatre block (2 theatres), Intensive Care Unit (6 beds), Paediatric block (22 beds) and the rehabilitation block. The hospital also has a hemodialysis unit which was started in 2000. Administration The hospital is managed by a Director, who is assisted by the management and services unit. The director reports to the State Health Deputy Director (Medical services) and the Selangor State Health Director. The hospital has 13 departments and 12 units. It received the MS ISO 9001:2000 certification on 11 November 2005.

He was born at M√©zin in the d√©partement of Lot-et-Garonne, France, where his father was clerk of the peace. He studied law and became an advocate at N√©rac, beginning his public career there as municipal councilor (1868), afterwards mayor (1871), and as councillor-general of the department of Lot-et-Garonne (1871). Being an ardent Republican, he lost this position in May 1873 upon the fall of Thiers, but in February 1876 was elected deputy for N√©rac. In the chamber he sat with the Opportunist Republican parliamentary group, Gauche r√©publicaine, signed the protestation of 18 May 1877, and was re-elected five months later. In 1880 he became under-secretary of state in the department of the interior in Jules Ferry's ministry (May 1880 to November 1881). From 7 August 1882 to 20 February 1883 he was minister of the interior, and for a month (from 29 January 1883) was prime minister. His ministry had to face the question of the expulsion of the pretenders to the throne of France, owing to the proclamation by Prince Napol√©on (January 1883). Falli√®res, who was ill at the time, was not able to face the storm of opposition, and resigned when the senate rejected his project. The following November, however, he was chosen as minister of public instruction by Jules Ferry, and carried out various reforms in the school system. He resigned in March 1885, becoming minister of the interior in Maurice Rouvier's cabinet two years later. He exchanged his portfolio in December for that of the department of justice. He returned again to the ministry of the interior in February 1889, and finally retook the department of justice from March 1890 to February 1892. In June 1890 his d√©partement (Lot-et-Garonne) elected him to the senate by 417 votes to 23. There Falli√®res remained independent of party struggles, although maintaining his influence among the Republicans. In March 1899 he was elected president of the senate, and retained that position until January 1906, when he was chosen by a union of the groups of the Left in both chambers as candidate for the presidency of the republic. He was elected on the first ballot by 449 votes against 371 for his opponent, Paul Doumer. Falli√®res was an outspoken opponent of the death penalty and commuted the sentences of many prisoners sentenced to death.

Biography He was born at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (Basses-Pyr√©n√©es). He studied law in Paris, and was called to the bar in 1851. The coup d'√©tat of that year aroused the strenuous opposition of Floquet, who had, while yet a student, given proof of his republican sympathies by taking part in the fighting of 1848. He made his name by his brilliant and fearless attacks on the government in a series of political trials, and at the same time contributed to the Temps and other influential journals. He delivered a scathing indictment of the Empire at the trial of Pierre Bonaparte for killing Victor Noir in 1870, and took a part in the revolution of 4 September as well as in the subsequent defence of Paris. In 1871 he was elected to the National Assembly by the d√©partement of the Seine. During the Commune, he formed the Ligue d‚Äôunion r√©publicaine des droits de Paris to attempt a reconciliation with the government of Versailles. When his efforts failed, he left Paris and was imprisoned by order of Thiers, but soon released. He became editor of the Republique Fran√ßaise, was chosen president of the municipal council, and in 1876 was elected deputy for the eleventh arrondissement. He took a prominent place among the extreme radicals, and became president of the group of the \\"Union r√©publicaine.\\" General Boulanger in 1888 In 1882 he held for a short time the post of prefect of the Seine. In 1885 he succeeded Henri Brisson as president of the chamber. This difficult position he filled with such tact and impartiality that he was re-elected the two following years. Having approached the Russian ambassador in such a way as to remove the prejudice existing against him in Russia since the incident of 1867, he rendered himself eligible for office; and on the fall of the Tirard cabinet in 1888 he became president of the council and minister of the interior in a radical ministry, which pledged itself to the revision of the constitution, but was forced to combat the proposals of General Boulanger. Heated debates in the chamber culminated on 13 July in a duel between Floquet and Boulanger in which the latter was wounded. In the following February, the government fell on the question of revision, and in the new chamber of November, Floquet was re-elected to the presidential chair. The Panama scandals, in which he was compelled to admit his implication, destroyed his career: he lost the presidency of the chamber in 1892, and his seat in the house in 1893, but in 1894 was elected to the senate. He died in Paris. See Discours et opinions de M. Charles Floquet, edited by Albert Faivre (1885). There is a controversy regarding an episode that took place at Palais de Justice in June 1867 when Russian Emperor Alexander II had visited the institution in Paris. Many insist that Charles Floquet said to the Tzar: ¬´Vive la Pologne, Monsieur!¬ª, which was an extremely impolite way of addressing a monarch. As Charles Floquet said himself, he had only said ¬´Vive la Pologne!¬ª, and when the Tzar turned his head, Maurice Joly, a fellow lawyer of the Paris Bar, had said: ¬´Oui, Vive la Pologne, monsieur!¬ªMario Proth.

The Star Line ferry La Salle docked at Mackinac Island, Michigan Star Line Mackinac Island Hydro-Jet Ferry is the newest ferry boat company serving Mackinac Island in Michigan. They currently run the most daily departures to Mackinac Island. The company has a dock at Mackinaw City and at two at St. Ignace.http://www.mackinawinfo.com/star-line-ferry- schedule/, 2019 Star Line Ferry Schedule History Star Line Mackinac Island Hydro-Jet Ferry was started by Tom Pfeiffelmann, Sam McIntire, and others in the late 1970s. The company started off previously as Argosy Boat Line. The company was named Star Line after the 5 original stockholders making up a 5 pointed star. They operated slower ferries including the La Salle and Nicolet as well as the Treasure Islander and Flamingo. In 1979 Star Line brought their first fast ferry, Marquette, to the Island. Over the next few years the old La Salle and Nicolet were replaced with sisters to the Marquette. When Arnold Transit Company introduced their catamaran Island Express in 1987, Star Line responded with Radisson, an 85-foot fast ferry which was modeled after a luxury yacht. She boasted two propellers as the other ferries had, but also had twin hydro-jets for added speed. One hydro pointed out of the water making an incredible plume of water behind the boat. In time the La Salle, Nicolet, and Marquette added hydro-jets. In 1990 Star Line added Cadillac and in 1993 added Joliet. These boats were built in the style of the Radisson. In 2005, Marquette was sold to Davis Park Marine of Patchogue, NY. She was replaced by the larger Marquette II. And in 2006, Nicolet was sold to Davis Park Marine to repower the Joliet. In November, 2016, Star Line announced that it would be purchasing the majority of competitor Arnold Transit Company's assets as the older Arnold Transit Company ceased all services to Mackinac Island after almost 140 years of service and went out of business due to financial problems. They still, however, operate their freight boat, which also carries US Mail and FedEx parcels, as Arnold's Freight Company, out of St. Ignace. https://www.mackinacisland.org/other_member/arnold-freight-co/, Arnold Freight Co. Star Line had agreed to buy six of the Arnold boats, its boatyard and several docks in late 2016.https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2016/11/03/mackinac-island- arnold-ferry/93260488/, Mackinac Island's longest-running ferry Arnold Transit to stop service Star Line Hydro-Jet Mackinac Island Ferry's Mascot \\"Skipper\\" poses with Star Line employee Star Line has only a single competitor carrying visitors to Mackinac Island, Shepler's Ferry, with docks at Mackinaw City and St. Ignace.

Early career Ribot was born in Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais. After a brilliant academic career at the University of Paris, where he was laur√©at of the faculty of law, he rapidly made his mark at the bar. He was secretary of the conference of advocates and one of the founders of the Soci√©te de legislation compar√©e. During 1875 and 1876 he was successively director of criminal affairs and secretary-general at the ministry of justice. Representative In 1877 he entered politics, playing a conspicuous part on the committee of legal resistance during the Brogue ministry; in the following year he was returned to the chamber as a moderate republican member for Boulogne, in his native d√©partement of Pas-de-Calais. His impassioned yet reasoned eloquence gave him an influence which was increased by his articles in the Parlement in which he opposed violent measures against the unauthorized congregations. He devoted himself especially to financial questions, and in 1882 was reporter of the budget. He became one of the most prominent republican opponents of the Radical party, distinguishing himself by his attacks on the short-lived Gambetta ministry. He refused to vote the credits demanded by the Ferry cabinet for the Tongking expedition, and helped Georges Clemenceau overthrow the ministry in 1885. At the general election of that year he was a victim of the Republican rout in the Pas-de-Calais, and did not re-enter the chamber till 1887. Cabinet member After 1889 he sat for Saint-Omer. His fear of the Boulangist movement converted him to the policy of \\"Republican Concentration,\\" and he entered office in 1890 as foreign minister in the Freycinet cabinet. He had an intimate acquaintance and sympathy with English' institutions,' and two of his published works ‚Äì an address, Biographie de Lord Erskine (1866), and Etude sur l'acte du 5 avril 1873 pour l'etablissement d'une cour supreme de justice en Angleterre (1874) ‚Äì deal with English law; he also gave a fresh and highly important direction to French policy by the understanding with Russia, which was declared to the world by the visit of the French fleet to Kronstadt in 1891, and which subsequently ripened into a formal treaty of alliance. He retained his post in √âmile Loubet's ministry (February‚ÄìNovember 1892), and on its defeat he became president of the council, retaining the direction of foreign affairs. The government resigned in March 1893 over the refusal of the chamber to accept the Senate's amendments to the budget. On the election of F√©lix Faure as president of the Republic in January 1895, Ribot again became premier and minister of finance. On 10 June he was able to make the first official announcement of a definite alliance with Russia. On 30 October the government was defeated on the question of the Chemin de fer du Sud, and resigned office. The real reason of its fall was the mismanagement of the Second Madagascar expedition, the cost of which in men and money exceeded all expectations, and the alarming social conditions at home, as indicated by the strike at Carmaux. After the fall of Jules M√©line's ministry in 1898 M. Ribot tried in vain to form a cabinet of \\"conciliation.\\" He was elected, at the end of 1898, president of the important commission on education, in which he advocated the adoption of a modern system of education. The policy of the Waldeck-Rousseau ministry on the religious teaching congregations broke up the Republican party, and Ribot was among the seceders; but at the general election of 1902, though he himself secured re-election, his policy suffered a severe check. He actively opposed the policy of the Combes ministry and denounced the alliance with Jean L√©on Jaur√®s, and on 13 January 1905 he was one of the leaders of the opposition which brought about the fall of the cabinet. Although he had been most violent in denouncing the anti-clerical policy of the Combes cabinet, he now announced his willingness to recognize a new r√©gime to replace the Concordat of 1801, and gave the government his support in the establishment of the Associations culturelles, while he secured some mitigation of the seventies attending the separation. He was re-elected deputy for Saint-Omer in 1906. In the same year he became a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in succession to the duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier; he was already a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In justification of his policy in opposition he published in 1905 two volumes of his Discours politiques. On 3 January 1909, Ribot was elected a member of the French Senate, and in February of the following year was offered, but refused, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the Monis cabinet. After the formation of the Poincar√© Government on 14 January 1912, Ribot took the place of L√©on Bourgeois as president of the committee appointed to deal with the Franco- German treaty, the necessity for the ratification of which he demonstrated. In 1913 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidency of the Republic, and on the fall of Barthou's Government was invited by Poincar√©, who was now President, to form a Cabinet, but refused. In 1914 he became, with Jean Dupuy, leader of the Left Republican group which refused to accept the decisions of the Radical Socialist congress at Pau in October 1913. First Premiership On 9 June 1914, Ribot became Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, but his Government was bitterly assailed by the Radical Socialists as well as other groups, and only lasted one day. World War I With the outbreak of World War I Ribot's great reputation as an expert in finance and foreign affairs brought him effectively into office. On 27 August 1914 he became Minister of Finance in Viviani's Ministry of National Defence, an office which he retained when, on 28 October 1915, Aristide Briand succeeded Viviani as Prime Minister. On 7 February 1916 he visited London and held a conference with the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the Treasury. When Briand reconstituted his Cabinet, in December 1916, Ribot retained the portfolio of Finance. On the fall of the Briand Ministry, President Poincar√© again called upon Ribot to form a government, and this time he consented, himself taking the portfolio of Foreign Affairs in addition to the premiership (19 March). In the statement of his policy made to the Chamber on 21 March he declared this to be \\"to recover the provinces torn from us in the past, to obtain the reparations and guarantees due to France, and to prepare a durable peace based on respect for the rights and liberty of peoples.\\" On 31 July, in a reply to the German Chancellor Georg Michaelis, he admitted that in 1917 an agreement had been made with Tsar Nicholas to erect the German territories on the left bank of the Rhine into an autonomous state, but denied that there had been any question of their annexation to France. End of political career Ribot's final ministry was during the most dismal part of the First World War, seeing the failure of the Nivelle Offensive and the famous mutiny of the French soldiers which followed. Following the decision to dismiss Interior Minister Louis Malvy, his government resigned office on 2 September, but he accepted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Painlev√© cabinet constituted six days later. He resigned office finally on 16 October, owing to the violent criticism of his refusal to fall into the \\"trap\\" of the German peace offers. Ribot left politics, and died in Paris on 13 January 1923 at the age of 80. The main grammar school (lyc√©e) in Saint-Omer, the Lyc√©e Alexandre Ribot, bears his name today.

It is supposedly based on H.P. Lovecraft's 1917 story, \\"The Tomb\\". However, the plot of the film is completely unrelated to the Lovecraft short story.H.P. Lovecraft‚Äôs The Tomb reviewed by Steve AndersonDread Central reviewDVD Verdict review The film was compared to the 2004 movie, Saw, and the series was mentioned on the box art. The film is also known simply as The Tomb, but the title on the DVD case is HP Lovecraft's The Tomb. However, on the film itself, the title is given as \\"H.P. Lovecraft The Tomb\\", with no apostrophe or 's'. Plot Tara (Victoria Ullmann) and Billy (Christian Behm) awake in a dark basement or warehouse, bloodied and covered with wounds. As they explore the empty surroundings, they find other wounded people who die in horrible ways at the hands of \\"The Puppetmaster,\\" a sinister villain who plays a deadly game with them in which there will be only one survivor. H.P. Lovecraft is mentioned several times during the course of the film by some characters, and the 'Puppetmaster' is referred to as 'Charles Dexter Ward' and one of his victims as 'Pickman' (a reference to Lovecraft's story Pickman's Model). However these passing references to Lovecraftian characters (and a quote from one of Lovecraft's stories about going \\"beyond ye spheres\\") are largely irrelevant to the serial killer plot played out on screen. Filming Production of HP Lovecraft's The Tomb took place during August 2005 in Marina Del Rey, California, at a warehouse on Princeton Drive that has since been demolished. The scenes at the \\"Palm Desert Motel\\" were shot on an indoor set at the same warehouse. Exteriors were shot in the high desert near Palmdale, California. Co-executive producer Jeff Frentzen is wearing the black gloves of the killer throughout the film.

USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) on 3 February 1943. During the predawn darkness of 3 February 1943, Rednour, wearing a rubber suit to ward off hypothermia, was among the members of the crew of the United States Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) who voluntarily subjected themselves to pounding seas and bitter cold in the winter North Atlantic darkness for nearly four hours to rescue survivors from the torpedoed troop transport . Realizing the \\"... danger of being crushed between the rafts and the ship's side, or of being struck by a propeller blade if the engines backed, he swam in under the counter of the constantly maneuvering Escanaba and prevented many floating survivors from being caught in the suction of the screws, in one instance retrieving a loaded raft.\\"This quotation, from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r3/rednour.htm) is unattributed. Rednour worked the longest of all retrievers and accounted for the greatest number of survivors, but finally had to quit when his rubber suit became torn.

A series of Syriac inscriptions dating to the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE have been found at the site.Lipinski, 2000, p. 170. Inscriptions that refer to the \\"Lord of the gods,\\" are thought to be references to Sin. In nearby Edessa, worship of Sin, who was also the main deity in Harran, extended back to the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE, and continued until some time in the 4th century CE when solar worship began to predominate.Texidor, 1979, p. 68. Part of interior of Pognon's cave Sumatar is also described as, \\"the seat of the governors of 'Arab,\\" who derived their authority from Sin.

Gameplay  The player controls Kirel, an alien creature in a world made of blocks and inhabited by monsters. Bombs have been set in each level and Kirel must reach and defuse them before they explode. Kirel can pick up blocks and drop them. He cannot jump higher than one block so must build staircases to reach high places. He cannot descend heights greater than one block, however if he picks up the block or item on which he stands, he will safely fall to the lower level regardless of drop. He can build a limited number of horizontal Bridges to traverse gaps. (Remaining Bridges are indicated at bottom left of the screen.) Kirel cannot pick up blocks from the base level, nor place blocks on the top level. He cannot pick up the block upon which the Exit door will eventually appear. He can carry only one block at a time. Monsters move randomly around the map and will drain Kirel's energy if they climb on him. Kirel can kill them in turn by climbing on them, but this costs him Pieces of Cake. (Remaining Pieces are indicated at bottom left of the screen.) If a monster is on the highest level of the map then it cannot be killed. Nor can Kirel be attacked in that position. Various objects are scattered around the landscape: *Pieces of Cake enable Kirel to kill monsters *Arrows give Kirel extra Bridges *Sweets (resembling cupcakes, toasters, and pies) restore Kirel's energy *Balls slow down the Bomb fuse *Teleports transport Kirel to other parts of the map *Pyramids block Kirel's path and cannot be moved (later levels also feature invisible Pyramids) *Cubes destroy sections of the map and enable access to hidden bombs When all the Bombs have been defused an Exit door will appear to take Kirel to the next level.

Not much is known about him other than the fact that he preceded King Hagler as chief. His training was evidently under \\"king\\" Whitmannetaughehee's leadership. As a warrior he served during a longstanding state of warfare with northern tribes, particularly the Iroquois Seneca, and the Lenape (aka Delaware), an Algonquian-speaking people who had occupied coastal areas and had become vassals of the Iroquois after migrating to Ohio Valley. The Catawba chased their raiding parties back to the north in the 1720s and 1730s, going across the Potomac River. At one point, a party of Catawba is said to have followed a party of Lenape who attacked them, and to have overtaken them near Leesburg, Virginia. There they fought a pitched battle.Legends of Loudoun, Harrison Williams, p. 63‚Äì64 Similar encounters in this tireless warfare were reported to have occurred at present-day Franklin, West Virginia (1725),Frederic Morton, The Story of Winchester in Virginia p. 38 Hanging Rocks and the mouth of the Potomac South Branch in West Virginia, and near the mouths of Antietam Creek (1736) and Conococheague Creek in Maryland.Joseph Doddridge, 1850, A History of the Valley of Virginia, pp. 29‚Äì33. Mooney asserted that the name of Catawba Creek in Botetourt came from an encounter in these wars with the northern tribes, not from the Catawba having lived there. The colonial governments of Virginia and New York held a council at Albany, New York in 1721, attended by delegates from the Six Nations (Haudenosaunee) and the Catawba. The colonists asked for peace between the Confederacy and the Catawba, however the Six Nations reserved the land west of the Blue Ridge mountains for themselves, including the Indian Road or Great Warriors' Path (later called the Great Wagon Road) through the Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia backcountry. This heavily traveled path, used until 1744 by Seneca war parties, went through the Shenandoah Valley to the South. In 1738, a smallpox epidemic broke out in South Carolina. It caused many deaths, not only among the Anglo-Americans, but especially among the Catawba and other related tribes, such as the Waxhaw, Wateree, Congaree, Sugeree, Santee, Waccamaw, Winyaw, Sissipahaw, Shakori, Enoke, Cheraw, Peedee, Dawhee, etc. Eventually after this epidemic, Yanabe Yalangway became the paramount chief of the Catawba people, not necessarily as Whitmannetaugheehee's direct successor. The Sissipahaw, Shakori, Enoke and possibly some other small tribe were absorbed into the Catawba people to survive themselves and to strengthen Yanabe Yalangway's people. Yanabe Yalangway was paramount chief of the Catawba people when, in 1744, the Treaty of Lancaster, made at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, renewed the Covenant Chain between the Iroquois and the colonists and the governor of Virginia, who had not been able to prevent settlers going into Iroquois territory, offered the tribe payment for their land claim. The peace was probably final for the Iroquois, who had established the Ohio Valley as their preferred hunting ground by right of conquest, but the more western tribes continued warfare against the Catawba, who were now so reduced as for their own number that they could raise little resistance. In 1744 the Natchez and Pedee attacked and killed several Catawba people and the Catawba drove them into European settlements.John Reed Swanton, 1952, The Indian Tribes of North America. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution (Reprinted by Genealogical Press)=s97 During the \\"King George's War\\" (1744-1748) the Shawnee and, eventually, the Cherokee (but southern Shawnee were sometimes called \\"Cherokee\\") made their attacks against the Catawba and, when the Catawba tried to find a refuge in the Carolinian settlements, against these settlements too. \\"King\\" Yanabe Yalangway had to deal with these very difficult years and led the Catawba through a crucial period. He was murdered in 1750 by a band of Iroquois, during a period of conflict with the Iroquois from the North. He was on his way home from Charleston following a conference with South Carolina's Colonial Governor James Glen.

Hazara Town encompasses nine blocks, beginning at Brewery Road near Bolan Medical College and continuing to Kirani road. The area has a geographical importance, as it makes up the largest part of Chiltan Town of Quetta city.  History  The earliest record of Hazaras in the areas of present day Pakistan are found in the Broad-foot's sappers company in 1835 at Quetta. This sappers company participated in the First Anglo-Afghan War. Besides this Hazaras also worked in the agriculture farms in Sindh and construction of Sukkur barrage. Hazara Town, like the twin suburb of Mehr Abad, has built up over the last century due to chronic food deficiency in the Hazaristan region of Afghanistan and the persecution of Hazara people by Abdur Rahman Khan, Amir of Afghanistan in the late 19th century.Blind chickens and social animals: creating spaces for Afghan women's narratives under the Taliban, by Anna M. Pont, Mercy Corps (COR), 2001, Link, , p.95. In his seminal book War and Migration, Alessandro Monsutti classifies the Hazara migration to Balochistan in the following phases: From 1878‚Äì1891 Following the second Anglo-Afghan war, the first Hazaras came to Quetta to seek employment in British-run companies under the Raj. They are thought to have worked on the building of roads and the Bolan Pass railway as well as enlisting in the British army of India. At that time, there could have been no more than a few hundred Hazaras in Balochistan. The subjugation of Hazarajat by Afghan emir Abdul Rahman, between 1891 and 1893, triggered a mass exodus of Hazaras to Turkistan, Khorasan and Balochistan. From 1901 to 1933 The situation in Afghanistan returned to normal under Habibullah (1901‚Äì1919), the son of Abdur Rahman. He offered amnesty to the Hazaras but this proved to be of little help in improving the lot of the Hazara in Afghanistan. Many Hazara were reluctant to return to Afghanistan and determined to rebuild their lives in Quetta. In 1904, the 106th Hazara Pioneers, a separate regiment for the Hazaras formed by the British, offered greater careers prospects, social recognition and economic success. The area was established in 1908 by Haji Nasir Ali (an ethnic Hazara, for whom Nasirabad is named) who bought the land from a Kirani Moudodi Chishti Syed family and built housing there. Many ethnic Hazaras from Afghanistan who came earlier were living in different areas of Quetta moved to the settlement, attracted by cheaper land and the security of the scheme. From 1933 to 1971 The regiment of Hazara Pioneers was disbanded in 1933. Deprived of this social and professional outlet, Hazaras went to settle in Quetta between the 1930s and 1960s, although the process of migration never completely dried up. From 1971 to 1978 Following the 1971 drought, Hazaras settled in Quetta or went to Iran in search of work. Between 1973 and 1978, conflict over the Pushtunistan issue between Pakistan and the Afghan regime, was another factor of Hazara migration to Pakistan, since President Daud Khan of Afghanistan saw the Hazara as Pakistan's allies. Following the Communist coup in April 1978 and the Soviet intervention in December 1979, the migratory movement assumed hitherto unprecedented dimensions. \\"The area was established in 1982 by Haji Ali Ahmed (an ethnic Hazara) who bought the land from a Kirani Baloch family and built housing there. Many ethnic Hazaras from Afghanistan and who were living in different areas of Quetta moved to the settlement, attracted by cheaper land and the security of the scheme.\\" Population The population of Hazara Town is approximately 1,500,000, who are mostly Hazara, but there are also some other evening ethnicities living in Hazara Town. The other ethnicities such as Persian speaking Pashtons, Sayeds, Sayed Shashpar(6par) also live among the Hazaras in Hazara town. \\"The community of Hazara Town is a distinct minority in Quetta, which is dominated ethnically by baloch and is predominantly shia muslims.\\" Ethnic Hazaras are a majority in quetta, at about 40% of the total population. They speak Hazaragi as their mother tongue and practice Shi'a Islam. The population of Hazara town increases rapidly which requires wider residential areas. Most of the houses in Hazara Town are constructed of concrete. Shopping Hazara Town has established its own bazaar and food supply source for the people which help them in their shopping facilities. These shopping areas are mainly named as Ali Abad, Masjid Road and Hussain Abad. New Markets are being built which will increase the popularity of Hazara Town more than ever. Supplies are mostly delivered to Hazara town from the main producers.

The agreement was signed at Canterbury some time between 12 and 15 August 1264. The Peace of Canterbury built on the previous Mise of Lewes; a settlement forced upon King Henry on the day of his defeat in the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264.Maddicott (1994), pp. 272-3. The Canterbury settlement, however, went further than the previous settlement had done. After the Battle of Lewes, a triumvirate had been set up, consisting of Montfort, Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, and Stephen Bersted, Bishop of Chichester. These three in turn appointed a governing council of nine men. The arrangement in effect took control of government out of the hands of King Henry, and placed it with the baronial faction led by Simon de Montfort. These arrangements were intended to be in effect temporarily, until a permanent settlement could be reached. The Peace of Canterbury, on the other hand, stated that if the conditions of the Mise of Lewes could not be met, then the council would remain in power throughout Henry's reign, and up until an unspecified point in the reign of his son Edward. There was also mention of reform of the church and royal government, particularly to do with banning foreigners from official positions.Powicke (1962), pp. 193-5. The agreement was highly unfavourable to Henry and Edward, but it must be assumed that they agreed to it under duress, since Edward was held hostage by the barons after the defeat at Lewes. On 15 August the document was dispatched to King Louis IX of France, who previously had been acting as an arbiter between the two parties. Louis had already rejected the terms of the Mise of Lewes; the stricter conditions of the Peace of Canterbury might have been intended to bring pressure on the French king, to help bring about a settlement. King Louis, however, rejected the proposition in angry terms. He was reported to have said that he would rather break clods behind a plough than have this sort of kingly rule. Montfort's government after this gradually started running into problems. In the spring of 1265, Gloucester defected to the side of the royalists, and Edward managed to escape his captivity. The baronial rule came to an end on 4 August 1265, when Montfort was defeated and killed at the Battle of Evesham, and Henry was restored to full powers.Powicke (1962), pp. 201-3.

The clubhouse is the former Beaux-Arts mansion on Embassy Row built for Herbert and Martha Blow Wadsworth and designed by noted architect George Cary. During World War I the Wadsworth House was used as the local headquarters for the American Red Cross. In 1932 a group of local women led by Mabel Thorp Boardman established the Sulgrave Club and purchased the mansion. They chose architect Frederick H. Brooke to renovate the triangular-shaped building into a clubhouse. The Sulgrave Club was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1964 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The building is also a designated contributing property to the Dupont Circle Historic District and Massachusetts Avenue Historic District. The clubhouse is one of two remaining large houses on Dupont Circle, the other being the Patterson Mansion. The building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style, popular during the time of its construction. The clubhouse includes a lavishly decorated Beaux-Arts ballroom while some of the other rooms feature different architectural styles, including an Arts and Crafts entrance and Colonial Revival reception area. History Holy Cross Episcopal Church site The Holy Cross Episcopal Church once stood on the lot where the Sulgrave Club is located. The congregation was established in 1874 and although there is no record of when the church was built, the sanctuary was expanded and a brick tower added in 1882 for $2,000. The parish closed in the 1880s due to financial reasons and the property was abandoned. In 1889, the property was purchased by Senator Charles Van Wyck who lived across the street at 1800 Massachusetts Avenue NW. While their home was being remodeled, the Van Wyck family moved into the deserted church, which was a surprise to everyone in the fashionable Dupont Circle neighborhood. Members of St. Thomas' Parish began meeting in the building in 1890 until their new sanctuary was built a few years later on the corner of 18th and Church Streets NW. Wadsworths and American Red Cross Herbert and Martha Blow Wadsworth, a wealthy couple from Geneseo, New York who had married in 1888, wanted a winter residence in Washington, D.C., and chose Dupont Circle as the location of their new home. There were only two large lots still available on the circle where they could build a mansion, including the one where Holy Cross Episcopal Church stood. Van Wyck's widow, Kate, sold the property to the Wadsworths in 1896. The Wadsworths were already familiar with Washington, D.C., and had family and social connections with the city. Herbert's cousin, James Wolcott Wadsworth, was a congressman from New York, and Martha's sister and niece were local socialites. On January 16, 1900, a permit application was filed to construct the Wadsworth mansion on Square 137, a triangular lot which is sited between 18th Street on the east, P Street on the north, and Massachusetts Avenue on the south. The couple chose a longtime friend, New York architect George Cary, to design their new house in the popular Beaux-Arts style. It is the only known building in Washington, D.C. that was designed by him. Cary is best known for his designs at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition and the Buffalo History Museum. Martha took a hands-on approach with the design of her new home, and would often claim she was the architect. Just like the Perry Belmont House that was built a few years later, the Wadsworth House's design was made to fit an irregular shaped lot. The total cost of constructing the house was around $300,000, equivalent to $9.2 million in 2020. The couple had their new home designed to specifically serve as a place of entertainment and socializing. This included a two-story ballroom, a musician's gallery, a porte-coch√®re similar to the one across the street at the William J. Boardman House, and a new feature in the city, an automobile room that served as an internal parking garage. It is believed the porte-coch√®re, vestibule, servants hall, kitchen, back hallway, and automobile room incorporated the former church building. After the house was completed by builder Charles A. Langley, Martha began years of organizing and hosting social events. These included standard social gatherings such as dances, dinners, and musicals, but she also hosted lessons for singing, beauty, jujutsu, and even held an ugliest baby photograph competition. As the couple aged, they spent less time at their Washington, D.C. home, and during World War I let an organization use the building In February 1917, the Wadsworth House became the first American private residence to be lent for use by the American Red Cross. The organization continued using the building until the war ended and the Wadsworths spent very little time at the house after that. Sulgrave Club Mabel Thorp Boardman played a large role in founding the Sulgrave Club. The Wadsworths used their home for two more years until 1920, when they abandoned it. The building sat vacant for the next twelve years. In 1932 during the Great Depression a group of 20 local women, led by Mabel Thorp Boardman who lived across the street, purchased the property for $125,000 to serve as headquarters of their new private social club. Boardman did not want to see the house further deteriorate and it would most likely have been turned into a Masonic lodge. To honor the bicentennial of President George Washington's birth, the women called their new organization the Sulgrave Club, named after Washington's ancestral English home, Sulgrave Manor. Members chose local architect Frederick H. Brooke to oversee the renovation of the Wadsworth House into the Sulgrave Club. Some of the renovation work including removing the porte-coch√®re, installing new bathrooms and an elevator, and extensively redesigning the interior. The total cost of the renovation and initial real estate tax was $43,000, bringing the total investment to around $168,000. The members raised this money during the Great Depression by taking out a $50,000 mortgage, receiving a private loan of $3,000, selling bonds worth $74,500, and collecting $1000 a piece from 41 women who would not have to pay an initiate fee or annual dues. The mortgage would eventually be paid off in 1954. The Sulgrave Club was incorporated in April 1933 and according to its charter, the group was founded for \\"literary, musical, artistic and philanthropic purposes, and for promotion of social intercourse.\\" The club forbade diplomats from becoming members and barred press photographers. In addition to Boardman, Sulgrave Club founders include: Henrietta Brooke, May Palmer Depew, Christine Gillett, Laura M. Gross, Bell Gurnee, Florence Jaffray Harriman, Sallie Aley Hert, Adelaide Wellington Houghton, Boardman's sister Florence Boardman Keep, Ellen Warder Leonard, Agnes E. Meyer, Louise Norman, Cissy Patterson, Isabel Weld Perkins, Elizabeth Hope Gammell Slater, Nelly Katherine Sweeney, Mildred Fuller Wallace, Annie Louise Bliss Warren and Maie Hewitt Williams. Club founders wanted their organization to be the center of local society much like the Colony Club in New York and Chilton Club in Boston were at the time. The club began hosting musical and artistic gatherings, dinners, debutante balls, and other events that attracted the city's high profile women. Prominent early members included Helen Herron Taft and Alice Roosevelt Longworth. Within months of its founding, the Sulgrave Club had already hosted prominent events including an official dinner for UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The Sulgrave Club continued hosting many notable people and events during the next several decades, including breakfasts with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, an inaugural party for President Jimmy Carter, launch parties for Frances Parkinson Keyes novels, and performances by Arthur Rubinstein. One infamous event that took place in 1950 at the clubhouse involved Senator Joseph McCarthy and journalist Drew Pearson, who had teased McCarthy while at their table. As Pearson waited at the coat check, McCarthy confronted him, kneed Pearson in the groin, and then violently slapped him. McCarthy was eventually stopped by another guest attending the dinner, a senator from California, future President Richard Nixon. On November 8, 1964, the building was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites, and on December 5, 1972, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The clubhouse is also designated a contributing property to the Massachusetts Avenue Historic District, listed on the NRHP on October 22, 1974, and the Dupont Circle Historic District, listed on the NRHP on July 21, 1978. In the 21st century the Sulgrave Club continues to be a popular place to gather. Even though some of the other social clubs in the city have closed, like the Sulgrave Club's main competitor across the street, the Washington Club housed in the Patterson Mansion, the Sulgrave Club still has a waiting list to join and brings in millions of dollars each year. Members and their guests attend dinners, parties, talks on various topics, and have the option to stay the night in one of the club's bedrooms. Honorary members of the club during its history have included First Ladies, cabinet members, congresswomen, and military officials. Location and design George Cary's original floor plan from January 16, 1900. The Sulgrave Club is located at 1801 Massachusetts Avenue NW on the northern portion of Square 137, in a triangular lot bounded by 18th Street, Massachusetts Avenue, and P Street. The main entrance is on the Massachusetts Avenue side and the west corner of the property faces Dupont Circle. The east side of the building facing 18th Street measures 76 ft (23.2 m), the south side facing Massachusetts Avenue measures 136 ft (41.5 m), and the north side facing P Street measures 125 ft (38.1 m). The building is 40 ft (12.2 m) tall, 3.5 stories, and includes a basement. The architectural style is an eclectic example of Beaux-Arts and includes 18th century English and French design elements. There are three composite bays on the 18th Street side, five composite bays on the P Street side, and nine bays on the Massachusetts side. The corner facing Dupont Circle and the corner facing 18th Street and Massachusetts Avenue each feature three-bay bows. The base of the clubhouse is limestone and features decorative molding. The building is made of yellow brick with a limestone cornice between the first and second floors. The block sill windows on the first floor feature voussoirs. The more elaborate second floor double hung windows include panel architraves, friezes, and overhangs. On the same floor there are Louis XVI French windows and wrought-iron balconies. The exception is on the east windows where the ballroom is located. The windows there are higher and do not have balconies. There are limestone oval-shaped and double-hung windows on the third floor. The main entrance on Massachusetts Avenue is where the porte-coch√®re once led carriages through the property to P Street. The porte-coch√®re was filled in during the 1932 renovation and the entrance featured a standard porch. In 1952 the entrance was remodeled and replaced with a canopy supported by iron corbels, a limestone stoop, and eight glazed French door panels. Above the entrance are Palladian windows with fluted columns, pilasters, and an entablature. The mansard roof features include limestone entablatures, architraves, friezes, and an urn balustrade. Many of the original details remain inside the house, despite renovations that have occurred through the years. The Arts and Crafts style entrance hall leads guests to the Colonial Revival style reception room on the east side of the building.

It is the only Conservative congregation in Howard County, Maryland. History When the town of Columbia, Maryland, was formed in the 1960s, in accordance with an idea of James Rouse, an Interfaith Center was created where all places of worship in the town would initially share a hall.Joseph R. Mitchell and David Stebenne (2007). New city upon a hill: a history of Columbia, Maryland, p. 97. History Press, Charleston, SC. . The attempt to first organize a Jewish community in the Columbia area began in 1967. Temple Solel (now known as Temple Isaiah) became the area's Reform temple, and Beth Shalom became the area's Conservative congregation.Mitchell and Stebenne, p. 98 Both have since obtained their own buildings. An attempt to form an Orthodox community was unsuccessful. Beth Shalom was founded in 1969. It has since grown to more than 400 families. Spiritual leaders The original spiritual leader was the late Rabbi Noah Golinkin, who was hired in 1978. Rabbi Kenneth Cohen was the second spiritual leader, who assumed the position in 1986. The third and current spiritual leader of Beth Shalom is Rabbi Susan Grossman, who has held the position since 1997. Grossman was ordained in 1985 and is considered unusual for being a female rabbi in the Conservative movement from that generation. Grossman is known for authoring works on the Conservative view of ritual purity.Ellen M. Umansky and Dianne Ashton, ed. (2009). Four Centuries of Jewish Women's Spirituality, p. 194.

It was released in July 1971 by Dischi Ricordi. The album focuses on the contraposition of \\"love\\" and \\"not-love\\". As a result, the LP is split in two definite \\"sides\\", each one made up of four songs: * The \\"non-love\\" side, characterised by a rock and roll music style and lyrics referring to \\"non-love\\" situations (e.g. adultery, unrequited or obsessive love, etc.). * The \\"love\\" side, characterised by instrumental tracks with long titles and a progressive rock music style. The album was Italy's 10th best selling album in 1971, though no song from this disc became nearly as popular as those included in Battisti's other albums from this period.

The convention provides a legal framework for the establishment of cross-border regions. As of 2014, it has been ratified by 39 CoE member states. The Convention has two parts. Whereas the first part contains the legally binding regulations of the treaties, the second part lists a series of ‚Äòmodel agreements‚Äô, both for the inter-state and the local levels, as options for possible CBC arrangements. This latter part of the convention is intended for guidance only and has no treaty value. The legally binding obligation the Convention puts on the signatory states is to facilitate cross-border cooperation between territorial authorities and to promote the conclusion of agreements that may prove necessary for this purpose (art. 1). Furthermore, the contracting parties commit to encourage any initiative by territorial authorities inspired by the model agreements listed in part two of the Convention. At the same time, the fulfilment of these obligations is subject to a number of clauses. CBC shall not alter the existing powers of the territorial authorities as they are defined in the respective domestic legal orders. The signatory states are also allowed to exclude certain types of authorities from the scope of the Convention. These clauses mean that the fulfilment of the international law Convention is always limited by national law. The second part of the Convention contains various optional ‚Äòmodel agreements‚Äô, grouped in two categories, i.e. inter-state agreements on the one hand, and contracts between local authorities, on the other. The proposed model agreements provide possible frameworks for varying degrees of co- operation which were drafted according to actually existing CBC treaties and arrangements, such as the 1974 treaty between Luxembourg and the German Land Rheinland-Pfalz. For instance, the model agreements listed under art. 1.4 and 1.5 were inspired by the such as the 1974 treaty between Luxembourg and the German Land Rheinland-Pfalz Subsequently, they informed a series of further inter-state treaties, enabling local authorities to participate in private and public law CBC initiatives. In 1995, the Convention was supplemented by an Additional Protocol, ruling that cross-border co-operative arrangements can be set up as independent bodies which may or may not have legal personality. If the co-operation body does have legal personality, the latter is defined in the law of the country in which its headquarters are located. As stated in art. 4, the co-operation body cannot be empowered to take measures which apply generally or which might affect the rights and freedoms of individuals. It must be specified whether the body is to be considered a public or private law entity within the respective national legal systems. However, the protocol gives the signatory states the option to extend the powers of such co-operation bodies (art. 5). They can be established as public law entities whose decisions have the same legal force as if they had been taken by the participating authorities themselves. Such bodies can therefore make decisions which are legally binding not only for the participating authorities but also for any individuals affected. In view of the far-reaching implications of such a transnational public authority, Germany, France and Sweden chose to sign the protocol without art. 5. The Additional Protocol significantly extends the provisions made by the Madrid Convention. However, the Convention still does not contain any regulations that override national law. This is why all initiatives have to conform to the national legal systems of the respective countries. Thus, no public law CBC initiative can be based on the CoE Convention and its additional protocols, but must be grounded either in inter-state treaties or at least unilaterally in national law.

His musical style spans over indie rock, country, americana and punk. He is best known as a solo artist who performs with changing line-ups. As such, he has released three albums to critical acclaim; despite being released on independent labels, two of them were included in lists of best album of the year in South African magazines as well as in Billboard. Three South African newspapers also listed Neversink albums among their albums of the decade. Before he went solo, Neversink was the co- founder and lead guitarist of Famous Curtain Trick, a country/pop/rock band which rose to mainstream popularity in South Africa in the 1990s and was nominated for a SAMA Award. His most notable instrument is the guitar, including a home-built lap steel guitar. Childhood and early youth Neversink was born in Durban on 16 June 1969. Growing up in Durban, he would listen to jazz, blues and country at home; he took up the guitar at the age of eighteen. 1990's: Early career  Famous Curtain Trick  In the early nineties, Neversink and Nadine Raal founded the pop-rock-country band Famous Curtain Trick, which performed songs written mainly by Neversink and Raal. The band consisted of lead singer/guitarist Raal, Neversink on guitar, lap steel and backing vocals, Garth Johnstone, later Duncan Smith on bass, and in the early stages Kevin O'Grady, then Warren Peddie, later Craig Nash on drums. They released Famous Curtain Trick (EMI, 1995; produced by Neill Solomon) and Land of no Cadillacs (Universal, 1996; produced by Dave Birch, front man of Squeal, previously guitarist of The Camera Club), nominated for a South African Music Award in the category \\"Best Pop Album\\". Live performances included the music festivals Splashy Fen (1995, 1997, 1999), Wingerdstok (1997), Oppikoppi (1997), Southern Cross Folk & Rock Festival (2000) as well as opening for Roxette in Durban (1995) and touring South Africa with Bryan Adams (1999). In 2000, the band split up. Other collaborations For a while, Neversink formed part of the alternative country/lo-fi rock band Lilo. He appears on bass on the band's first album Light me up a Lucifer (2002). Other members were, at the time, Alexander Sudheim, Graeme Barnes and Dean Henning. He appears on lap steel on \\"Calling\\" off Syd Kitchen's album Africa's not for sissies (2001). 2000‚Äì2009 In 2001, Neversink moved to Johannesburg and began using the artistic name Jim Neversink. Jim Neversink (Ent Entertainment 2005) Neversink's self-titled solo debut album was produced by Matthew Fink. Recorded partly under primitive circumstances in Neversink's bedroom, it was nominated \\"Album of the Year\\" by The Star, pronouncing it \\"a masterpiece that will no doubt stand the test of time\\". Beeld listed it among the \\"Top-Ten Albums\\" of the year, and, at the turn of the decade, included it in a list of South African albums of the decade. Channel24.co.za had it on their five-item list of \\"South African releases of the year\\", giving it five stars out of five. Their review, which likewise referred to the album as a \\"South African masterpiece\\", awarded it five stars out of five, remarking that \\"Neversink and Matthew Fink have produced a benchmark album, seemingly out of nowhere.\\" The CD has Jim Neversink on voice, guitar, lap steel, piano and harmonica, Matthew Fink on accordion and guitar and Katherine Hunt on bass, violin and backing vocals. Two tracks feature Paul \\"Roach\\" Cochrane on bass and Ashton Nyte on lead guitar.Jim Neversink CD liner notes. Shakey is Good (Radio Lava, 2008) A second album, with Fink, Hunt and now Warrick Poultney on drums, and produced by Fink, likewise earned critics' acclaim: it came in as No. 2 on The Times international \\"Top 20 albums\\" of 2008; Billboards South African correspondent placed it as no 6 on her international list of \\"2008 Billboard Critics Top 10s\\"; Isolation.tv placed it as no 1 on their top-10 \\"South African albums of the year\\". The Times and Mail & Guardian included it in its listings of \\"albums of the decade\\". Channel24.co.za awarded it five out of five stars. Live performances Live appearances with the Fink/Hunt/Poultney line-up included performing at the London Forum as support act for Sixto Rodriguez (2005) and at the Oppikoppi festival (2006), the White Mountain Folk Festival (2006) and the Splashy Fen (2007). Other collaborations Television actor and singer Emmanuel Castis performs one of Neversink's songs, \\"Stay\\", on South of Nowhere (Next Music (Pty) Ltd, 2008). The song \\"Mail Order Russian Bride\\" (off Jim Neversink) is included on Southern Gems ‚Äì 18 Flawless Tracks from SA Stars (Sheer Sound, 2007). \\"Monkey\\" off Shakey Is Good is included in Beginner's Guide to South Africa (Nascente, 2010).For info, see Nascente ‚Äì Demon Music Group. Neversink contributes backing vocal and slide guitar on the song \\"Stranger\\" by Laurie Levine (Unspoken: Beyond The Box Music, 2006) as well as backing vocal on her song \\"Scrambling\\" (Living Room: Beyond The Box Music, 2009). He contributes slide- guitar on the song \\"Son\\" on Radio Kalahari Orkes's 2009 CD Heuningland. 2010‚Äìpresent Skinny Girls Are Trouble (One F, 2010) 2010 saw Neversink relocating to Copenhagen, Denmark and releasing his third album, Skinny Girls Are Trouble. Shortly after the launch of Shakey is Good, he had begun to perform with Loandi Boersma (bass) and Kevin O'Grady (drums) and various guest performers. This is also the line-up of the third album which has guest performances from Rian Malan, Lani Pieters and Timon Wapenaar. The album was produced in Johannesburg and New York by Richard Lloyd, former member of the new wave/punk rock band Television, and engineered, mixed and mastered by Peter Pearlson.Pearlson is an award-winning engineer and producer linked to the Forest Studios, Downtown Studios, and SABC Studios: An internet blog was set up to document the pre-production and recording processes. Released in September 2010, Skinny Girls Are Trouble has so far only been reviewed by the Mail & Guardian which called it \\"arguably Neversink's finest hour and easily one of the best South African albums released in 2010\\" and also included in a list of \\"10 South African songs that rocked my world in 2010\\". Copenhagen Collaborations Jim Neversink B√∏rneteater October 2013 Neversink has formed a new band for Jim Neversink in Copenhagen, while playing a number of guest spots at live concerts, playing guitar and lapsteel with a number of local acts, including Gutten & Gutten and the 'bluegaze' group Me After You. In 2014 he became a founding member of Frederiksberg Country Club, a local scene for live experimental music of all genres. Other collaborations and activities In 2013, Neversink wrote the score for Durban Poison, a crime/love story by South African film director Andrew Worsdale, that won 'Best South African Feature Film' at the 34th Durban International Film Festival in July 2013. Neversink's score, noted as 'hypnotic' by one reviewer, was given a special jury award in the \\"Long Narratives competition\\" at the 3rd Luxor African Film Festival in 2014. In 2015 he contributed a rendition of Afrikaans poet Ingrid Jonker's ‚ÄòBitterbessie dagbreek‚Äô to the compilation CD \\"Die kind is nog jonger\\".http://www.vetseun.co.za/anarkans/komp/kompdiekind.html . Lyrics Neversink's lyrics have been the subject of special acclaim; the Mail & Guardian, upon the release of Shakey is Good, pronounced him \\"one of the finest songwriters in South Africa\\". The Star justified a no-1 placement on a best-albums list by referring to \\"the raw emotion, the intelligent songwriting which he has crafted beautifully\\"; and The Times remarked: \\"No one comes close to Jim Neversink in making observations about the small details of living in South African towns sound so cinematic (...) Neversink‚Äôs off-kilter way of looking at society‚Äôs damaged things stands alone.\\" Channel24.co.za speaks of \\"moments of Sparklehorse brilliance, and (...) a Jim White feel to the strange tales of peri-urban paranoia and quixotic questing.\\" Love, together with death and longing for life on the other side, are recurring themes on both albums; the angle is often darkly romantic, occasionally humorous and defiant. Some songs would appear to be personal and autobiographical; thus, \\"Always dreaming about you\\" and \\"Angel\\" (off Jim Neversink), the former dedicated to his late father, the latter to an ex-girlfriend. Others, like \\"Monkey\\" (off Shakey Is Good) or \\"Transfer to Harding\\" (off Jim Neversink), are narrative-driven ballads about life's outsiders. Similarly, \\"Ride, Ride Ride\\" (off Jim Neversink) was written with bank-robber Andre Stander in mind; the title of \\"Even Elizabeth Klarer\\" (off Shakey Is Good) refers to a famous alien abductee, and the protagonist of \\"Klackerty Kate\\" is a statuette of a disabled girl, placed in supermarkets to collect funds for Polio research. Neversink sings in South African English, his mother tongue. As can be seen from the examples mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the songs contain many references to life in South Africa. Additional examples (all from Skinny Girls are Trouble) are: in \\"Hope\\", the protagonist, a young girl, jumps off Van Stadens Bridge, known to attract suicidals; Emmarentia Dam which sets the scene for \\"Tambourine\\" is a recreative area in Johannesburg; and Steve Hofmeyr mentioned in \\"Durban City Hall\\" is a popular singer of Afrikaans pop. Influences and musical style Whereas some journalists have dubbed Neversink \\"a modern-day Johnny Cash\\" and \\"SA's answer to Johnny Cash\\", others place him in the vicinity of Chris Isaak, the Jayhawks, Wilco and Calexico and detect influences from Lead Belly and Loretta Lynn. He himself has labelled his music \\"loserbilly\\". He has expressed his admiration for artists and bands as Lou Reed, The Beach Boys, The Band, Hank Williams, Emmylou Harris, Harry Nilsson, The Beatles, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Gram Parsons and Slim Whitman.Fink is a producer, sound engineer and musician also known from his work with The Sick-Leaves, the City Bowl Misers, Laurie Levine and Steve Hofmeyr among others: The song \\"Always Dreaming of You\\" (off Jim Neversink) contains a reference to Slim Whitman and quotes his hit \\"Rose Marie\\". The word \\"Shakey\\" in the title of his second album is, partly, a reference to Neil Young's pseudonym, Bernard Shakey.

Fields and Jerome Chodorov, based on autobiographical short stories by Ruth McKenney. The stories were originally published in The New Yorker and then collected and published as the book My Sister Eileen (1938). The plot focuses on Ruth and Eileen Sherwood, sisters from Ohio who relocate to New York City in search of fame and fortune. Witty Ruth aspires to be a published writer, while pretty Eileen dreams of success as an actress. Their financial circumstances force them to rent a dingy basement studio apartment in a Greenwich Village building owned by Mr. Appolpolous, one of many colorful characters who cross their path.

Peggy Knudsen replaced Sayers in June 1942 (when she left to be married), and Quine was replaced by Henry Jones, who in turn was replaced by Max Showalter. Eileen McKenney, an executive assistant to Walt Disney and the inspiration for the play's title character, and her husband, novelist and screenwriter Nathanael West, were killed in an automobile accident in El Centro, California four days before the Broadway opening (they were driving to the Los Angeles Airport to board a plane for New York, to attend the play's premiere). Her sister Ruth consequently did not attend the premiere and never saw the play.New York Times, 21 December 2003 Fields and Chodorov adapted their play for the 1942 film that opened while the play was still running on Broadway, as well as the 1953 musical Wonderful Town. It also served as the basis for the 1960 television sitcom of the same title.

There are Dravidian mural paintings on the walls inside and outside of the main entrance. The fresco of Pradosha Nritham (Dance of Shiva) is one of the finest wall paintings in India. There is a golden flagstaff inside the temple topped with an idol of a bull surrounded by small bells and metal banyan tree leaves. In terms of architecture, these temples stand out to be an ultimate testament for the Vishwakarma Sthapathis for their engineering skills.

There is a separate temple for Lord Krishna. It is believed that the philosopher Adi Sankaracharya wrote 'Soundarya Lahari' while staying in the temple.

Many people come to the temple on the 8th and 10th day of the festival, when seven and a half elephants (in Malayalam: ezharaponnaana) made of gold (nearly 13 Kgms) will be held in public view. This statue was donated to the temple by a travancore maharaja. The temple, one of the wealthiest Devaswoms in Kerala, has many valuable possessions. The Thulabharam is one of the important rituals of this temple. People make offerings to God for favors received. On balance, the child or man for whom offerings were promised to God, is weighed against offerings ranging from gold to fruits. Aaraattu (Holy Bath)  The annual Aaraattu (Holy Bath) of Lord Shiva at Ettumanoor Mahadevar Temple is performed at the villages of Peroor, Neericadu, and Thriruvanchoor on the banks of the Meenachil River. It is one of the rituals performed as part of festivals at the major temples of Kerala, India. During this ritual, the priest takes the deific form of the god within him and takes a bath in the holy water. This event is mainly carried out at the end of the festival. One of the most prominent Arattu in Kerala is conducted in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Trivandrum by the Travancore royal family. https://findwords.info/term/aaraattu Ezharaponnana Ezhara Ponnana refers to the seven-and-a-half golden elephants which are kept in the temple vault and taken out once a year for darshan by the devotees. Of the eight statuettes, seven have a height of two ft., and the eighth one is half that size, hence the name Ezhara (seven-and- a- half) Ponnana (Golden elephants). According to legend, they were presented to the temple by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the founder of the Travancore kingdom. According to another story, while Marthanda Varma had made the pledge to present the ‚Äòponnana,‚Äô the offering was made during the reign of his successor, Maharaja Karthika Thirunal. There are also differing stories about the reason for the offering: some believe it was offered as a penalty for the damages suffered by the temple during the annexation of Thekkumcore by Travancore; others believe it was the offering made when the marauding army of the Tipu Sultan was hammering on the gates of Travancore. The statuettes are made of a jackfruit tree and covered with nearly 13 kg. of gold plates. Ezhara Ponnana Darshan is one of the high points of the temple festival, held at midnight on the eighth day of the ten-day festival. Ezhara Ponnana Darshan begins with the ceremonial procession of the eight golden statuettes of elephants. They are later kept at the Asthana Mndapam for the annual darshan by the devotees.

It is the third band-specific SingStar game released in the UK and Australia, following up on SingStar ABBA and SingStar Queen. It was released in 2009. Gameplay SingStar games require players to sing along with music in order to score points. Players interface with their console via SingStar USB microphones while a music video plays in the background. The pitch players are required to sing is displayed as horizontal grey bars, which function similar to a musical stave, with corresponding lyrics displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game analyses a player's pitch and compares it to the original track, with players scoring points based on how accurate their singing is. Different modes of SingStar may vary this basic pattern, but the principle is similar throughout. SingStar includes a variety of game modes. The standard singing mode allows one or two people to sing simultaneously, either competitively or in a duet. The PlayStation 3 version of the game supports trophies. Launch SingStar Take That was launched at the SingStar Take That Extravaganza charity party on Wednesday 25 November 2009 at the Tabanacle in Notting Hill. The event was hosted by comedian James Corden and featured a number of celebrity guests including Kate Moss, Pixie Geldof, Rachel Stevens, Remi Nicole, Paloma Faith and the band Take That themselves.

Incident Several hours before the British surrendered on Christmas day at the end of the Battle of Hong Kong, Japanese soldiers entered St. Stephen's College, which was being used as a hospital on the front line at the time. The Japanese were met by two doctors, Black and Witney, who were marched away, and were later found dead and mutilated. They then burst into the wards and bayoneted a number of British, Canadian and Indian wounded soldiers who were incapable of hiding. The survivors and their nurses were imprisoned in two rooms upstairs. Later, a second wave of Japanese troops arrived after the fighting had moved further south, away from the school. They removed two Canadians from one of the rooms, and mutilated and killed them outside. Many of the nurses next door were then dragged off to be gang raped, and later found mutilated.Dew, Josie. (2002). The Sun in My Eyes: Two-Wheeling East. Warner Books publishing. , . p 184. The following morning, after the surrender, the Japanese ordered that all these bodies should be cremated just outside the hall. Other soldiers who had died in the defence of Stanley were burned with those killed in the massacre, making well over 100 altogether. Aftermath When the college and the grounds of Stanley Prison became a civilian internment camp, the internees gathered up the burnt remains, shards of bones, buttons and charred effects from the cremation, and then buried them. A gravestone marks the spot where these items were interred at Stanley Cemetery.

Now closed to rail traffic the bridge is used as a footpath. History The Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway's extension to Peebles was authorised on 3 July 1860 but by the time construction was complete in 1863 the company had been absorbed by the much larger Caledonian Railway. The bridge is smaller but of similar design to the nearby Neidpath Viaduct and it often confused with it. Located just to the north of the River Tweed, it was built to carry the Symington to Peebles branch line obliquely at a height of over Lyne Water, close to its confluence with the Tweed and consists of three sandstone skew arches each of span and laid with helicoid courses, and a plate girder approach span of to the west. The total length of the structure is . From the slender piers pilasters extend to parapet level and the parapet is capped by cast-iron railings. On 1 January 1923 ownership of the viaduct, along with the rest of the Caledonian Railway, passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and thence to the Scottish region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The line lost its regular passenger traffic on 5 June 1950 and closed completely on 7 June 1954 but the bridge remains in use as a footpath.

In 1965, Tollberg was transferred to Colombia and served as ARC Almirante Padilla (DT-03) until being stricken and scrapped in 1973. History Construction and commissioning Tollberg was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Tollberg (DE-593) on 30 December 1943 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts, and was launched on 12 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Maynard W. Tollberg. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-103 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 31 January 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Edward F. Butler, USNR, in command. Pacific War Tollberg stood out of Boston, Massachusetts, on 18 February 1945 for shakedown training off Bermuda. She left Bermuda on 9 March and arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 11 March. On 25 March, Tollberg got underway to escort attack cargo ship to the Panama Canal Zone. Tollberg transited the Panama Canal on 31 March and on 1 April proceeded independently to California. She reached San Diego, California, on 9 April and, on 15 April, departed for Hawaii. Tollberg arrived at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 22 April, but left again on 4 May and proceeded via Eniwetok to Ulithi Atoll. She got underway on 31 May with destroyer escort to escort the landing craft repair ships and and tanker to Okinawa, where the Okinawa campaign was in progress. She arrived at the Hagushi beach area on 4 June and was assigned to picket duty in the antiaircraft and antisubmarine screen. Tollberg had only one opportunity to fire her guns at the enemy, at a distant Japanese aircraft. On 8 August, Tollberg and destroyer escort joined battleships and to screen them on a voyage to the Philippine Islands. On 9 August, Tollberg rescued a pilot from California whose float plane had swamped while taxiing in to be picked up. The warships arrived at Leyte in the Philippines on 11 August, and Tollberg remained there until 20 August. World War II ended during her stay at Leyte with the surrender of Japan on 15 August. Postwar Tollberg departed the Philippines on 20 August to escort a convoy to Okinawa and returned to Leyte on 29 August. Between 20 September and 3 October, she escorted Transport Squadron 14 to Wakayama Bay, Japan, and back to Leyte. On 2 November, she left Manila, Luzon, to carry passengers to Okinawa and, after escorting amphibious force command ship to Shanghai, China, disembarked them at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 7 November. On 12 November, she was back at Manila. Between 24 and 26 November, she embarked 156 passengers at Samar in the Philippines for passage to the United States East Coast. Departing Samar on 27 November, Tollberg called at Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, San Diego, and the Panama Canal Zone before arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 December. She remained at Norfolk until 26 March 1946, when she headed for the West Indies. After two months in the Caribbean, she was at the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York, from 20 May to 24 July. She then entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard at Charleston, South Carolina, for preservation work which continued from 26 July to 12 November. Tollberg then moved on to Green Cove Springs, Florida, arriving there on 13 November. Decommissioning and disposal Tollberg was decommissioned at Green Cove Springs on 20 December 1946 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on the St. Johns River there. In September 1959, she was towed from Mayport, Florida, to Sabine Pass, Texas, and laid up with the Texas Reserve Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Tollberg was stricken from the Navy List in November 1964 Colombian Navy service Tollberg was transferred to Colombia under the Military Assistance Program on 14 August 1965.

It is a stone Neo-Gothic structure built in the early 20th century. It was the first of 65 similar churches, most also in Western New York, designed by Robert North, a former choirboy at the church. His design was informed by a trip he made to England, paid for by the dying widow who also underwrote the church's construction and wanted a design inspired by \\"the quiet spirit of the English countryside\\". North also followed contemporary architects like Ralph Adams Cram in their desire to extend the Gothic style beyond its medieval models, and made early use of newer building materials like reinforced concrete and cast stone. It is the third building to house the church, which dates to the early years of Batavia's settlement a century before the church's construction. In 2004 the church building, its rectory and a stone wall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Around the same time it faced a scandal surrounding the dismissal of its pastor, and the costs of maintaining an aging building raised doubts as to whether the church could continue using it. Fundraising efforts have enabled the church to restore its bell tower. Buildings and grounds The church complex is a parcel on the north side of East Main, midway between Ross and Vine streets, just east of downtown Batavia. On the west are two older houses now serving as professional offices; to the east are houses. Across the street are several larger commercial buildings and their parking lots. To the north is a baseball diamond associated with one of the city's elementary schools. Richmond Memorial Library, also listed on the Register, is to the northeast. The church property is on a slight rise in the middle of an otherwise level area. There are three buildings on the site, between the drives and parking areas on the east and west. The church itself is in the center, with the rectory to its northeast and a storage building to its northeast. A stone retaining wall with steps in the middle sets off the large lawn facing East Main on the south. All except the storage building are contributing properties to the Register listing. Church The church building itself has three sections. The main block, with the sanctuary, is a rectangular structure of sandstone laid in random ashlar sandstone with a steeply pitched gabled roof sheathed in blue and gray slate. It is dominated by the square bell tower at the south (front) end. Along both sides are stepped stone buttresses. All the Tudor Revival arched doors and stained glass windows have smooth finished limestone and cast stone surrounds. The large windows on the north and south sides have Decorated Gothic stone mullions; the aisle windows have Perpendicular Gothic mullions with quatrefoil carvings in the apex. Small windows are located in the clerestory. At the base of the bell tower is the wooden main entrance. Above it is the large southern window, with two vents having patinated copper louvers and an empty niche in between at the belfry stage. A bas-relief Celtic cross rises to the parapeted roofline. On the west side is the church's office wing. It is a two-story Tudor Revival structure with the lower story sided in random ashlar stone and stucco and the upper in half-timber. At the top is a decorative cross-gabled roof; on the sides are multi-paned casement windows. A newer concrete block educational wing projects from its north. Interior Inside, the tower base's high arch makes it a narthex, with a glazed wood screen setting it apart from the nave. The white marble baptismal font is located in the center aisle a short distance from the nave. The floor is terra cotta panels set in cast concrete. Walls are done in unpainted stone, cast stone and plaster scored to resemble stone. Dark stained oak panels complement the similar pews. The west aisle leads to a chantry altar and aumbry. Behind it is the organ chamber. A wood screen similar to the narthex screen sets off the chapel on the east side. At the north end is a traditional deep square chancel set off from the nave by a stone wall with brass gates. A white marble pulpit and lectern with brass eagle motif flank the steps. In the center is the white marble altar, originally against the north wall. Now located behind it is a paneled reredos with three niches. The center one has a figure of Christ holding his hand out in blessing. It is flanked by smaller niches with figures of St. James and St. John. On either side of the chancel are choir stalls. The inside of the office wing is minimally decorated. It has plaster walls and simple architrave door and window surrounds. The doors are paneled oak; other woodwork is stained in dark walnut. To the north the education wing has plain walls of painted concrete block; the fellowship hall has a large ceiling on laminated Tudor arched trusses. Rectory and storage building The rectory is a two-story Tudor Revival house with a cross-gabled roof. A garage is attached to the north. Its half-timbered stucco walls have a bank of casement windows on the south and paired casement windows elsewhere. The storage building is a simple gabled wood frame building with a north-south orientation. On its south end a rolling door is sheltered by a deep projection of the roof supported by wooden posts. History The St. James congregation was founded in 1815, in the early days of Batavia's settlement as the center of the Holland Purchase, most of today's Western New York, eight years before the settlement itself was incorporated as a village. Throughout the rest of the century, it occupied two buildings on Ellicott Street, neither of which are extant. Adelaide Richmond Kenny, a congregant and the only daughter of Dean Richmond, a local railroad executive who served as president of the New York Central, donated the money for the new church in the last years of her life. It was the culmination of over three decades of local philanthropy following her brief marriage, in which she also endowed nearby Batavia Hospital. In the early years of the 20th century, she gave Robert North $600 ($ in contemporary dollars.) to travel to the United Kingdom, directing him to \\"design a church in the quiet spirit of the English countryside.\\" He received the formal commission three days after Kenny died. That instruction brought North, a former St. James choirboy who had studied architecture at Cornell, into close contact with the type of churches held up as architectural exemplars in The Ecclesiologist a half-century before. Those English country churches had inspired Richard Upjohn, Frederick Clarke Withers and other Gothic Revival architects of that era. Contemporary architects like Ralph Adams Cram, Bertram Goodhue and Henry Vaughan were also designing churches from those models, but they believed that the style offered potential that had not been explored when it initially fell out of favor in the 16th century. Their churches, which emphasized clarity of design and functionality over the Picturesque elements of the earlier Gothic-inspired architects, were called Neo-Gothic. North's church was a sophisticated example of the style, one that anticipates later neo-Gothic churches. It recalls medieval models with its restrained decoration and buttresses outside. The inside also seems at first to be strictly following medieval precepts, but the high arch in the lower story of the tower, giving the effect of a continuation of the nave, departs from that model. North also made use of some new building materials of his time, such as structural reinforced concrete, particularly in the floor, and cast stone in the exterior tracery. He went on to design 65 other churches throughout Western New York in a similar style. The rectory was built in the same Tudor Revival as the office wing, in 1929. In 1953 the education wing was added to the latter's north end. Inside the sanctuary the altar has been moved off the north wall, in keeping with modern liturgical trends. There have been no other significant changes to the building and grounds since construction. As its centennial neared, St. James was at the center of a scandal. Rector Simon Howson was dismissed in 2004 after allegations that he had stolen from the church. A month later he filed a wrongful termination suit against the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York, claiming he had been retaliated against by the bishop for reporting sexual harassment by a visiting gay priest from Massachusetts. He was defrocked in 2007. The following year he and the diocese settled for an undisclosed amount. At that time the building's design and age were also issues for the church. The costs of maintaining its declining structure were further strained when the church's endowment lost money in the stock market declines of the late 2000s. Utility bills alone reached $60,000 a month. Howson's replacement had to leave since the congregation could not afford a full-time pastor, and the congregation pondered whether it should leave the building. Under new vicar Stephen Metcalfe, who took over in 2010, the church is hoping to raise the money to rehabilitate the aging bell tower.

It is intended to provide the perception of nearly full colour viewing with existing television, digital and print mediums. Danish company ColorCode 3-D ApS distributes the system, and says that it is covered by a number of patents around the world including .http://www.colorcode3d.com/Vault/PDF/What%20is%20ColorCode%203-D.pdf Technology One eye (left, amber filter) receives the cross-spectrum colour information and one eye (right, blue filter) sees a monochrome image designed to give the depth effect. The human brain ties both images together. Images viewed without filters will tend to exhibit light-blue and yellow horizontal fringing. The backwards compatible 2D viewing experience for viewers not wearing glasses is improved, generally being better than previous red and green anaglyph imaging systems, and further improved by the use of digital post-processing to minimise fringing. The displayed hues and intensity can be subtly adjusted to further improve the perceived 2D image, with problems only generally found in the case of extreme blue. The blue filter is centred on 450 nm and the amber filter lets in light at wavelengths at above 500 nm. Wide spectrum colour is possible because the amber filter lets through light across most wavelengths in spectrum.  Notable uses  Barack and Michelle Obama, along with their party, watch the commercials during Super Bowl XLIII in the White House theatre using ColorCode 3-D. The technology premiered with a ColorCode 3-D release of nWave Pictures' Encounter in the Third Dimension, which was the first of a series of ColorCode 3-D releases distributed to IMAX theaters worldwide.

R√©gis Dericquebourg deemed the group as a ‚Äúhealing-oriented religion,‚Äù although it prefers not to be considered as a religion and includes members active in different religions. History Yvonne Trubert was born in Laurenan in 1932 in a Roman Catholic family. While living in Paris, she discovered what her friends believed to be effective healing powers, and she started gathering them in informal groups. By 1982, she had gathered some 60 members, who decided that an association should be formally incorporated. This happened in 1983, and the association Invitation √† la Vie (Invitation to Life) was born. Eventually, IVI developed in several other countries, and by 2000 it had several thousand members. Most of them remained active Roman Catholics and IVI became known for its mass pilgrimages, mostly to Catholic centers such as Lourdes, Fatima and Mont Saint-Michel. In 1987, however, the French Catholic Bishops published a declaration claiming that IVI was a ‚Äúgnostic‚Äù movement whose syncretism was incompatible with orthodox Catholicism.La Documentation catholique, April 5, 1987, p. 378. In France, in 1995Assembl√©e Nationale, ‚ÄúRapport fait au nom de la Commission d‚ÄôEnqu√™te sur les sectes‚Äù, 1995. and 1999,Assembl√©e Nationale, ‚ÄúRapport ‚ÄòLes sectes et l‚Äôargent‚Äô‚Äù, 1999. IVI was included in governmental lists of cults and sects (in 1995 under the name ‚ÄúInvitation √† la vie intense‚Äù). On the other hand, in 2007 the association Invitation to Life has been declared of general interest in France: this means that IVI is recognised as a not-for-profit organisation with tax-deductibility status for donations. Main doctrines D√©ricquebourg believes that healing is the center of IVI, and the main reason it attracts members. Healing, however, is seen by IVI as part of a larger process of ‚Äúharmonization,‚Äù where members are seeking harmony with themselves, the nature, and God. To achieve these aims, IVI proposes three ‚Äúkeys‚Äù: prayer, harmonization (intended as a specific technique), and vibrations. The Roman Catholic Rosary is the main prayer suggested, but prayer and harmonization are often practiced together. In IVI‚Äôs harmonization, an experienced member called ‚Äúharmonizer‚Äù asks the ‚Äúharmonized‚Äù to lie on a table and focus on the prayers recited by the harmonizer, who also practices a soft massage. ‚ÄúVibrations‚Äù are collective chants and sounds supposed to create harmony and peace.

Presumed security is the opposite of security through obscurity. A system relying on security through obscurity may have actual security vulnerabilities, but its owners or designers deliberately make the system more complex in the hope that attackers are unable to find a flaw. Conversely a system relying on presumed security makes no attempt to address its security flaws, which may be publicly known, but instead relies upon potential attackers simply assuming that the target is not worth attacking. The reasons for an attacker to make this assumption may range from personal risk (the attacker believes the system owners can easily identify, capture and prosecute them) to technological knowledge (the attacker believes the system owners have sufficient knowledge of security techniques to ensure no flaws exist, rendering an attack moot). Although this approach to security is implicitly understood by security professionals, it is rarely discussed or documented. The phrase \\"presumed security\\" appears to have been first coined by the security commentary website Zero Flaws. The article uses the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as an example, focusing on the apparent lack of entry security and contrasting it against the presumed security a military installation will have. The article also details the flaws inherent in a trust seal such as the Verisign Secure Site seal, and explains why this presumed security approach is actually detrimental to an overall security posture.

However, Butler himself cautions about taking the geographical clues too literally. He points out that \\"India\\" was a name applied indifferently by Greek and Latin writers to Arabia, Ethiopia, Libya, Parthia, Persia and the lands of the Medes.Butler on Batholomew Similarly the term Greater Armenia was used rather loosely by medieval writers to denote almost anywhere in the region between Eastern Anatolia, the Black Sea and the Caspian. Location Nonetheless, at least three locations have been proposed as possible sites of Albanopolis: DerbendThe Search for the Twelve Apostles, by William Steuart McBirnieButler's Lives of the Saints says \\"The place is said to have been Albanopolis (Derbend, on the west coast of the Caspian Sea)\\" in Dagestan, Albyrak/Albac near Ba≈ükale in the then Armenian region of what is now eastern Turkey, and Baku, Azerbaijan.In the Life of apostle Bartholomew Baku is identified as Alban. Some historians assume that Baku during the existence of Caucasian Albania was called Albanopolis. The latter has a certain ring of truth given that the area of today's Azerbaijan was historically known as Albania but no conclusive evidence has been found of any such theory. Butler is also sceptical of the Albyrak suggestion stating while the assertion that Batholomew preached and died in Armenia is possible, and is a unanimous tradition among the later historians of that country; ... earlier Armenian writers make little or no reference to him as connected with their nation.Butler's Lives of the Saints Thus although a very holy Armenian Monastery guarded what was believed to be Bartholomew's tomb on the site, this was probably a later idea.

The rally demonstrated the rapid popularization of Scouting with an estimated 11,000 boys attending with the prominent presence of Girl Scouts also being significant for the start of Girl Guides/Scouts. The rally was held a year and a half after the publication of Scouting for Boys and The Scout magazine, and two years after Robert Baden-Powell's demonstration Brownsea Island Scout Camp. The Rally was a precursor to the later Scout Jamborees and World Scout Jamborees. The concept of the Scouts' Own, a simple, non-denominational religious ceremony, was also introduced by H. Geoffrey Elwes at this rally. Members of the local Scout Troop, 2nd Croydon (1st Crystal Palace Patrol), formed part of the flag party for Princess Christian, the member of the Royal family in attendance. As a result, the Group, which is still in existence, has the right to call themselves Princess Christian's Own. The Group still meet near Crystal Palace Park and regularly use Crystal Palace park for Scouting activities. Girls Several hundred Girl Scouts also attended, including one group under their Patrol Leader Marguerite de Beaumont. They dressed in the Girl Scout uniform as given in the Scout handbook, and were officially registered as Girl Scouts. This was the first time Baden-Powell was able to discern clearly how many girls were interested in Scouting, although he knew there were several thousand. The media coverage of this rally, along with that in \\"The Spectator\\" magazine in October‚ÄìDecember 1909 initiated by Miss Violet Markham, led to the formal founding in 1910 of Girl Guides under his sister, Agnes Baden-Powell. Girls had been part of the movement almost as soon as it began. A contingent of girls from Peckham Rye spoke to Baden-Powell at the Rally. In December 1909 Baden-Powell decided to create a similar but separate programme for girls. In those days, for girls to camp and hike was not common, as this extract from the Scout newspaper shows: \\"If a girl is not allowed to run, or even hurry, to swim, ride a bike, or raise her arms above her head, how can she become a Scout?\\",Headquarters Gazette 1909 though it is a curiosity, as in those days many girls and young women belonged to bicycle clubs. In 1910, Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides, in some other countries called Girl Scouts, a parallel movement for girls. Agnes Baden- Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides. \\"Girl Guides seek leading light\\", couriermail.com, 28 February 2009 Attendees who later influenced Scouting and Guiding included Nesta G.

Tollberg (1904‚Äì1943) was a United States Navy sailor killed in action during World War II. He received a posthumous Navy Cross for his actions. Naval career Tollberg was born at North Branch, Minnesota, on February 17, 1904. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on September 24, 1923 and was honorably discharged on September 15, 1927. After the beginning of World War II, Tollberg reenlisted on June 23, 1942 with the same rating. He was assigned duty on board the destroyer USS La Vallette (DD-448). On the afternoon of January 30, 1943, during the second day of the Battle of Rennell Island, La Vallette was screening the damaged heavy cruiser USS Chicago (CA-29) when 11 Japanese torpedo planes attacked. La Vallette received a torpedo hit in her forward engine room which killed 22 members of the crew. Watertender Second Class Tollberg, although fatally scalded by high- temperature steam, painfully climbed up the fire room ladder and emerged on the main deck through a hatch which had been blown open by the detonation. Despite severe pain and partial blindness, he expended his dying strength trying to close the control valve through which fuel oil was pouring into the fireroom below, where a number of his helpless shipmates were trapped. Tollberg then collapsed and soon died of his wounds. Awards Watertender Second Class Tollberg was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. Commemoration The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Tollberg (DE-593) was named for Watertender Second Class Tollberg. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport USS Tollberg (APD-103), and was in commission as such from 1945 to \`1946.

The first two prototypes were significantly faster than the older aircraft, but proved to be less maneuverable. It was redesigned, incorporating many features of what would become the Ilyushin Il-10, but proved to be inferior to that aircraft in testing. It was not ordered into production. Development In summer 1942 Sergey Ilyushin was requested to design a heavy attack aircraft with a bombload of up to . He chose to scale up the single-engined Il-2 to use the new and more powerful Mikulin AM-42 engine, which was essentially a scaled-up version of the Il-2's Mikulin AM-38 engine. The design was initially designated the Il-AM-42, but it was soon allocated the factory designation Il-8. While the design of the Il-8 was based on that of the Il-2, it was a completely new aircraft.Gordon, pp. 59‚Äì60 The oil cooler was housed with the coolant radiator in a big airscoop on top of the engine cowling, closer to the cockpit than was the case on the Il-2. The gunner's position was enclosed in the armored shell, unlike that in the Il-2, and was equipped with a Berezin UBK machine gun on a VU-8 flexible mount. Otherwise the gun armament was identical to the older aircraft with a pair of VYa cannon with a total 300 rounds and a pair of ShKAS machine guns with 1500 rounds in the wings. Optionally two Nudelman-Suranov NS-37s could be installed instead of the VYa-23 cannon. The rear fuselage was lengthened by to improve airflow and the landing gear was lengthened to accommodate the larger propeller. The landing gear nacelles were modified accordingly.Gordon, p. 60 Two prototypes were built of the Il-8. The first had VYa-23 cannon and a wooden rear fuselage. The second had NS-37 cannon installed and a metal rear fuselage. The first flight was on 10 May 1943 and the prototypes were tested both as attack aircraft and as an artillery spotter variant with less range and better radios. Flight tests were reasonably successful with the Il-8 proving to be almost faster at low altitudes than the Il-2. It climbed 15% faster and had nearly twice the range of the older aircraft. Flight testing was prolonged by problems with the AM-42 engines. They were unreliable, smoky and vibration-prone. But the Il-8 proved to be less maneuverable than the Il-2 in both the horizontal and vertical planes. State acceptance trials lasted from 26 February to 30 March 1944 and it was provisionally accepted for production, provided that these issues were fixed. However, Ilyushin thought that the best features of the two-seat Il-1 prototype could be incorporated into the Il-8 design and approval for another prototype was granted on 1 July 1944. The new prototype, confusingly referred to in the records with the same Il-8-2 designation used for the second prototype of the original design, greatly resembled what would become the Il-10, except for a longer fuselage and the four-bladed propeller. The armament was changed as Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 cannon replaced the YVa-23 guns and the UBK was upgraded with a Berezin B-20 cannon in a VU-9 mount. A cassette of ten AG-2 aerial grenades was fitted to enhance rear defense. The bombload was upgraded to a total of 1000 kg compared to the of the first prototypes. The Il-8-2 made its first flight on 13 October 1944 and flight testing was once again delayed with engine problems and state acceptance trials were not completed until 7 July 1945. While it proved to be an improvement over the first design, it was inferior in performance to the Il-10 which was already in service and was not placed into production.Gordon, p. 61 Il-8 specifications See also References Notes Bibliography  Category:1940s Soviet attack aircraft Il-008 Category:Abandoned military aircraft projects of the Soviet Union Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1943 ","title":"Ilyushin Il-8"},{"id":"24087957","text":"was a private women's junior college in Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan.

Although the design was well received, plans were no longer listed as being available from Hummel Aviation as of 2007. In 2011, Adams Aeronautics Company of Dallas, Georgia, took over sales and support of the CA-2 design. Development The design goals of the CA-2 described a plans-built aircraft for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including a maximum empty weight. The CA-2 was also intended to be one of the lowest cost ways of obtaining an ultralight aircraft. These goals were met and the resulting aircraft has an empty weight of , when equipped with a Rotax 277 engine. At the time it entered the market, the airframe construction cost was estimated to be US$1600 and the total completion cost US$5000‚Äì6000. The price for the plans, consisting of 40 sheets of 11\\"X17\\" (28 X 43 cm), was US$150 in 2011. The CA-2 requires about 600 hours to build. The airframe is of all-metal construction using 2024-T3 aluminum sheet, extruded angles and tubing, fastened primarily with stainless steel pop rivets. Construction requires normal hand tools, plus a small bending brake and a tube bender. The fuselage and wings are of monocoque stressed skin construction. The wings include plain flaps and differential ailerons and are stressed to +4.4 and -2.2 g. The wings are removable by withdrawing three bolts. The control surfaces are made from aluminum tubing, are fabric covered and actuated by pushrods. The landing gear is of conventional configuration with a steerable tailwheel linked to the rudder. The prototype was powered by a Rotax 277. Heavier engines can be installed, although the aircraft will not then meet the US FAR 103 weight requirements as an ultralight aircraft. Other engines used include the Rotax 447, Rotax 377, 1/2 VW and the Hirth F-33.

He played college football at the University of Kentucky, and earned All-American honors. Early years Whalen attended La Salle High School in Milwaukie, Oregon. As a sophomore, he became a starter at wide receiver. He posted a combined 75 receptions for 1,300 yards and 25 touchdowns in his second and third years, earning All-league honors each season. As a senior, he helped his team win the league championship, while finishing with 68 catches for 1,502 yards and 18 touchdowns, receiving Tri-Valley League Player of the Year and All-state honors. He was a second-team All-state basketball selection at forward as a senior. He also lettered as a third baseman and pitcher in baseball. College career Whalen moved on to Shasta College, where he had one undistinguished season with 19 receptions for 154 yards and one touchdown. The next year, he walked on at the University of Kentucky, after showing head coach Hal Mumme a highlight video tape made by his mother. As a sophomore, he had 7 receptions for 66 yards. The next year, he was converted from wide receiver to tight end, recording 23 receptions for 239 yards and 3 touchdowns. As a senior he had a breakout season, being recognized as a consensus first- team All-American, after registering 90 receptions for 1,019 yards and 10 touchdowns, leading the tight ends in all three categories nationally. He set NCAA records for most receptions in a season and most receptions per game (8.2) by a tight end. His 90 receptions broke the school's single-season record and became the first tight end and second Kentucky player to top 1,000 receiving yards in a season. His 10 receiving touchdowns in a single-season at the time ranked second in school history. In 2016, he was named a Kentucky SEC Football Legend. Professional career Tampa Bay Buccaneers Whalen was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the fifth round (157th overall pick) of the 2000 NFL Draft, after dropping because it was considered he lacked size and speed. He was waived on August 27, after being passed on the depth chart by undrafted free agent Todd Yoder. Dallas Cowboys On August 30, 2000, the Dallas Cowboys signed Whalen to their practice squad and promoted him to the active roster on December 5, for the last 3 games of the season. The next year, he was allocated to the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe, where he led the league in receptions (66) and also had 691 receiving yards (second in the league) and 3 touchdowns. In 2001, he was declared inactive for the season opener. On September 22, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a strained right Achilles. In 2002, he was a core special teams player and tallied 15 tackles (fourth on the team).

Camilla was built in Chatham Dockyard to a design by John Williams and was launched in 1776. She served in the American Revolution, the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars, before being sold in 1831. American Revolution Camilla was commissioned in May 1776 and sailed for North America in August. There she captured the privateer schooner Independence, John Gill, Master, of six carriage guns, eight swivels, and 50 men. She was on a cruise from Boston.This is not the Massachusetts State Navy brig Independence that captured in November 1776. Camilla also captured Admiral Montague, sailing from Hispaniola to Rhode Island with a cargo of molasses and coffee, Chance sailing to Georgia with coffee, and Polly, sailing to Surinam in ballast. On 23 January 1777, north of Charlestown, South Carolina, Camilla, under Captain Charles Phipps, captured the American sloop Fanny, which was heading to that port from Cap-Fran√ßais, Hispaniola, with a cargo of molasses. Then in February Captain John Linzee took command of Camilla. On 20 February 1777, Camilla and , Captain George Keith Elphinstone, captured the 170-ton snow, Adventure. They captured her northeast of Antigua, British West Indies, as she was going from Newburyport, Massachusetts to St. Eustatius, Netherlands West Indies, with a cargo of fish, staves, spermacaeti candles and pine planks. Camilla fired eleven shots before Adventure would stop. Perseus and Camilla shared the prize money. Eight days latter, Camilla captured Ranger, William Davies, Master, which was sailing in ballast from St. Lucia. Fanny, Adventure, and Ranger were all condemned and sold at Antigua. April 1777 was a busy month for Camilla. On 6 April she captured the brig Willing Maid, bound from St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, to Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina, with a cargo of sugar, rum, and salt. However, the brig sprang a leak and sank. On 11 April 1777, Camilla was patrolling with 44-gun frigate near the mouth of the Delaware River, just north of the Cape Henlopen lighthouse, when they came upon the American merchantman Morris. Gunfire from the two British vessels drove Morris ashore, where she suddenly blew up with such force that it shattered the windows on the British vessels.Hahn (1988), p.19. Reports indicate that Morris was carrying 35 tons of gunpowder and that the captain and six crewmen still on the vessel were laying a train of gunpowder to blow her up, when things went wrong. It is not clear whether the powder train burnt too quickly or a shot from Camilla or Roebuck set it off. What is clear is that the vessel disintegrated and all aboard her died in the explosion. Much of her cargo of arms was, however, salvageable, and Americans onshore were able to get it.Shomette (2007), pp. 62-5. On the 15 and 20 April Camilla took two more prizes that were carrying rum, molasses and sugar, and molasses, respectively, but there are no details available. On 21 April, she captured Perfect, Etienne Codnet, Master, bound from Cape Nichola, Hispaniola, with a cargo of molasses. Then on the 25 and 26 April she took two more unknown vessels, both carrying rum and rice. She also captured Fonbonne, W. De Gallet, master, and W. Galley, owner, which was sailing from Cap-Fran√ßais to Miquelon with a cargo of wine and molasses. In July 1777, boats from Camilla and captured and burnt the Continental schooner Mosquito. Camilla captured several merchantmen in late 1777 or early 1778. On 15 November she captured the sloop Admiral Montague, sailing from Hispaniola to Rhode Island with a cargo of molasses and coffee. That same day, she captured Chance, Thomas Bell, master, which was sailing to Georgia with a cargo of flour and rum. Lastly, on 14 March 1778, Camilla captured Polly, William Thompson, master, which was sailing to Surinam in ballast. When Philadelphia fell to the British in 1777, several American vessels found themselves trapped between the city and the British fleet further down the Delaware River. The Americans launched some three fire ships towards the British, but gunfire from Roebuck, Camilla, and other British vessels caused the Americans to set their ships on fire too soon, and to abandon them. British boats were able to pull the fire ships on shore where they could do no harm. Recruiting poster from 1778 for Camilla In February 1778 Captain John Collins took command of Camilla. She then participated in two operations, one at Newhaven on 5 July and another at Penobscot from 21 July to 14 August. On 29 May 1779, Camilla was part of Admiral George Collier's small flotilla that sailed up the Hudson River and captured Stony Point, two months later the site of the American victory in the Battle of Stony Point. Amongst other services, she exchanged fire with Fort Lafayette. That summer, the British Fleet moved north. Camilla was one of the vessels that participated in Tryon's raid on New Haven, Connecticut in July. She was also among the vessels sharing in the prize money for the capture, on 14 August, of the American privateer Hunter. Camilla then participated in the battle that on 15‚Äì16 August destroyed the American Penobscot Expedition.Allen (1913), Vol. 2, pp. During the autumn Camilla captured the brig Chance, John M'Kay Master, off Cape Cod. The brig was sailing from St. Eustatius to Connecticut with a cargo of salt. Around this time she also recaptured the Mackerel and Marquis of Rockingham. On 12 October she captured the brig Revenge. In December Camilla sailed from New York to Charleston, South Carolina, with Vice Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot's squadron. Thus, spring 1780, found Camilla, Captain Charles Phipps, participating at the Siege of Charleston. The city capitulated on 11 May. Camilla shared in the prize money resulting from the naval captures. On 30 September, Camilla participated in the capture of the brigs Wasp, Potomack, and Portsmouth Hero, and the schooners Providence, Fanny and Betsey. Then on 1 November she took the schooner Henrico. On 19 April 1781, Camilla took the sloop Ann. Camilla then sailed to join the Downs squadron. Captain J. Wainwright assumed command in November 1782. She was paid off in March 1783. Between the wars Commander John Hutt of received promotion to post captain and then in March 1783 recommissioned Camilla. He sailed her for Jamaica on 11 May 1783. While she was on the Jamaica station a mutiny occurred aboard Camilla. Five men received 800 lashes. Camilla sailed back to Britain in 1784, but in December sailed for Jamaica again. In September 1790, Camilla was reported to have brought the Duke of Sudermania from Finland to the Swedish Royal Court at Drottningholm Palace. French Revolutionary Wars In March 1794 commissioned Camilla for the Downs station. After receiving promotion to post-captain on 31 October 1795, Richard Dacres was appointed to command Camilla, which formed part of Richard Strachan's squadron in the English Channel. Camilla shared with , , , and in the proceeds of the capture on 10 April 1796 of Smuka Piga. Then Camilla, , Diamond, , Syren, Magicienne, and Childers shared in the capture on 29 April of Mary. On 24 December , , Camilla and the hired armed cutter Grand Falconer, shared in the capture of Esperance. On 20 February 1797, Camilla captured Heros. In March Captain Stephen Poyntz replaced Dacres. The next month, on 19 April, Diamond, Minerva, , Grand Falconer, and Camilla captured the American ship Favourite, which was carrying a cargo of flour. Then on 20 May, Camilla captured Jeanie. When Robert Larkan took command of Camilla in September 1797, he brought with him Richard Spencer, who would go on to become an admiral, be knighted, and become Government Resident in Albany, Western Australia. On 6 November, Camilla took Marianne. Generals Thomas Maitland and Toussaint Louverture meet to discuss a secret treaty, unknown artist, c.1800 On 4 May 1799, after a three-week voyage from Philadelphia, Camilla arrived at Cap-Fran√ßais, Haiti, with the British General, Thomas Maitland on board. The British government had empowered him to pledge its support to General Toussaint Louverture. In January 1800 Camilla managed to take three prizes. On 6 January she took Jeune Aimie. Then six days later she captured Speculation, with the hired armed cutter Fly in sight. During the evening of 29 January 1800, off Le Havre, Camilla captured the French privateer lugger Vigoureaux (or Vigoreaux). Vigoureaux was armed with three guns, had a crew of 26 men and was 19 days out of Cherbourg, not having taken anything. was in sight. Then on 15 March Camilla left Portsmouth as escort to a convoy for Newfoundland. Later that year Camilla lost her mainmast in a storm while accompanying a convoy from Newfoundland to Britain. Though the storm scattered the convoy, Camilla arrived in Portsmouth, having found and escorted six vessels to Weymouth and Poole.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.433. In December 1801 Captain E. Brace replaced Larkan, only to be superseded in 1802 by Captain Henry Hill. Hill sailed Camilla from Portsmouth for Newfoundland on 29 July;Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p. 175. she returned to Portsmouth on 29 November.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.518. Napoleonic Wars Captain C. Woolaston briefly replaced Hill. Then in April 1803 Captain Brydges Watkinson Taylor took command of Camilla. In May he sailed for Newfoundland. On 15 August 1805, Camilla captured the French navy's brig-corvette , of 16 guns and 98 men. Camilla chased Faune for nine hours before capturing her at . The 74-gun, third rate had seen three sail and joined the chase, helping Camilla to capture Faune. The Royal Navy took Faune into service as HMS Fawn. Goliath, with in company, then sailed off to capture the French ship-corvette Torche on the next day. In December 1805, Taylor moved to , a new frigate, and Captain Charles Upton replaced him. In March 1806 Captain J. Tower replaced Upton. Between May 1807 and 1808 Camilla was in the Leeward Islands under the command of Captain John Bowen, who had taken command in July 1806. On 2 March 1808, a party of about 200 marines and sailors from , , and Camilla, all under the command of Captain Pigot of Circe, landed near Grand Bourg on the island of Marie-Galante. The militia on the island quickly surrendered, together with their 13 guns, plus small arms and gunpowder.Naval Chronicle, 1808, pp.428-9. Neither side suffered any casualties. In 1825 the crews of , Cerberus, Circe, and Camilla shared in the prize money arising out of the island's surrender. Between 30 July and August 1809 Camilla was one of the many vessels participating in the debacle of the Walcheren Campaign. On 3 November, Camilla, under temporary captain William Henry Dillon, encountered the Drie Gebroeders. She was sailing from Norway under a Danish master and with a cargo of timber. On her deck were a number of wooden trucks for gun-carriages, which were obviously war material. The master stated that he was taking his cargo to Britain so Dillon let him proceed. After two hours, the merchant vessel was plainly heading toward the Dutch coast so Dillon caught up with the vessel and seized it. The master claimed that he was sailing toward Holland only to avoid \\"the Lemon and Oar\\", a dangerous reef in the North Sea. Dillon knew that the master's explanation was inconsistent with the vessel's position and so sent the vessel to Britain as a prize.Dillon & Lewis (1956), vol. 2, pp. 143-144. Final years Camilla was laid up in ordinary at Sheerness in December 1809, and then used as a floating breakwater. From 1814 to 1825 she served as a receiving ship until she was \\"laid aground for the protection of the waters\\". The \\"Principle Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" offered \\"Lying at Sheerness, Camilla, of 433 tons\\", for sale on 13 April 1831. She sold on that day.

It is an 1880s stone structure in the Richardsonian Romanesque style designed by Rochester architect James Goold Cutler. His design was strongly inspired by several libraries in Massachusetts that Richardson himself had recently built. It was commissioned by local philanthropist Mary E. Richmond, wife of Dean Richmond, in 1889, as a memorial to her youngest son, Dean Richmond, Jr. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Building The library is located on the west side of Ross Street approximately north of East Main Street (New York state routes 5 and 33). The neighborhood, just east of the commercial core area of downtown Batavia, is predominantly residential, with some institutional structures. Resurrection Parish Catholic church is to the southwest and another large brick building is to the northwest. Further to the northeast is one of Batavia's schools; St. James Episcopal Church, also on the Register, is a half-block to the east. The terrain is level and some mature trees grow in the front yards and along lot lines. The building itself consists of the original building and a larger modern addition in its rear. The older section is a one- and-a-half-story L-shaped structure of sandstone in a random ashlar pattern, mostly grey with local red Albion stone as trim. Both sections have a steeply pitched gabled roof, with the projecting main entrance pavilion, off-center to the north, creating a cross-gable. At the northeast corner is an octagonal tower with conical top sheathed in copper and finial. A chimney rises from the south end. Steps lead up to the wide round segmental arch on low imposts, a particularly Richardsonian detail, which shelters the recessed main entrance. Inscribed in the stone above are ornate letters reading \\"Richmond Memorial Library\\". Above that are three small, narrow round-arched windows with some decorative stonework and a narrower, smaller window in the gable apex. Five deeply recessed sash windows with leaded glass transoms fill out the facade to the south end. The north gable has a similar set of round-arched windows in its apex. Inside, the reading room occupies most of the long wing. Behind an arch at the south end is a fireplace. Oak wainscoting extends halfway to the ceiling, from which an iron chandelier hangs. History Dean Richmond, Jr., died in his youth. His mother chose a piece of property near the family mansion as the site of a library to be built in his memory and donated to the city. She commissioned a design from James Goold Cutler, a builder and businessman who had invented the mail chute and later mayor of Rochester. Cutler consciously emulated several Romanesque libraries that had been built in recent years by Henry Hobson Richardson in the suburbs of Boston. Several of those had also been built in memory of a member of the family of a wealthy local philanthropist. Most prominent among those is the Thomas Crane Public Library in Quincy, the pattern for the Richmond Library. Like the Crane Library, today designated a National Historic Landmark, the Richmond Library employs a similar face of two-toned sandstone in a random ashlar pattern with a battered foundation, with a steep gabled roof. The entrance pavilion of both buildings is very similar, with the large arch and tripartite narrow windows. Turrets of similar height are also nearby. Inside, the Richmond has the oblong reading room with fireplace that characterizes Richardson's libraries. The only notable difference is in the front facade's remaining fenestration‚Äîthe Crane Library has what Henry-Russell Hitchcock described as a \\"curiously modern\\" strip of windows, while Cutler's are more conventional for the time. At the time of its construction, only the east (front) facade of the Richmond Library was done in stone. The north face's exposed brick was covered in matching sandstone when that wing was expanded in 1911, and the rear elevations remained brick until the modern wing was built. Inside, the only significant change was the addition of stacks to the reading room in 1900 as the library expanded. The library today The library is governed by a five- member board of trustees elected by residents of the Batavia City School District. All serve five-year terms; one is elected a year. The board meets the second Monday of each month. The library's mission statement is \\"to continually assure access to resources and services that meet the educational, informational and recreational needs of its community in a safe and comfortable environment\\". It is open every day except Sundays and holidays, with earlier closing hours on Fridays and Saturdays. In addition to services for children and teens it offers classes for adults interested in genealogy.

The largest of his two works in the memoir genre, it includes some of the most recognizable samples of first- person narratives in Romanian literature, and is considered by critics to be CreangƒÉ's masterpiece. Structured into separate chapters written over several years (from 1881 to ca. 1888), it was partly read in front of the Junimea literary club in Ia»ôi. While three of the total four section were published in CreangƒÉ's lifetime by the Junimea magazine Convorbiri Literare, the final part was left incomplete by the writer's death. The book offers an in-depth account of Ion CreangƒÉ's early life in what was then the state of Moldavia, with much insight into the social landscape of his childhood universe, describing relationships between its hero, mainly referred to with his hypocorism and patronymic NicƒÉ al lui »òtefan a Petrei or Nic-a lui »òtefan a Petrei (\\"NicƒÉ of »òtefan of Petru\\"), and the various people in his life. It traces NicƒÉ's coming of age passage, from an idyllic age spent the remote village of Humule»ôti (now part of T√¢rgu Neam»õ town) to rebellious adolescence and training for a Romanian Orthodox priesthood in the urban centers of FƒÉlticeni and Ia»ôi. The narrative flow is often interrupted by lengthy and characteristic soliloquies, imparting CreangƒÉ's worldview and regrets. The text itself is noted for its characteristic use of the Romanian lexis, including its accomplished rendition of Moldavian dialectal particularities. Childhood Memories went through several editions since its 1890s reprint, and came to be seen as a classic of local children's literature. It was an inspiration for several authors, and was the basis for Elisabeta Bostan's 1964 film Amintiri din copilƒÉrie. Narrative First chapter Casa din Humule»ôti (\\"The House in Humule»ôti\\"), painting by Aurel BƒÉe»ôu CreangƒÉ's accountBased on Amintiri din copilƒÉrie (Wikisource) opens with an extended soliloquy and a nostalgic description of his native area, with a short overview of Humule»ôti's history and his family's social status. The first chapter introduces and focuses on several characters directly linked to NicƒÉ's earliest school years: Vasile an Ilioaei, the young teacher and Orthodox cleric, who enlists him in the new class; Vasile's supervisor, the stern parson; SmƒÉrƒÉndi»õa, the intelligent but misbehaved daughter of the priest; CreangƒÉ's father »òtefan and mother Smaranda. One of the first episodes detailed by the book relates to corporal punishment as recommended by the priest: children were made to sit on a chair known as Calul Balan (\\"White Horse\\") and strapped with a device called Sf√¢ntul Nicolai (or \\"Saint Nicholas\\", after the school's patron saint). The fragment is also a humorous retrospective account of his interactions with other children, from their favorite pastimes (trapping flies with the horologion) to CreangƒÉ's crush on SmƒÉrƒÉndi»õa and the misuse of corporal punishment by a jealous peer tutor. CreangƒÉ recounts his early disappointment with school activities and appetite for truancy, noting that his motivations for attending were the promise of a priest's career, the close supervision of his mother, the prospects of impressing SmƒÉrƒÉndi»õa, and the material benefits of singing in the choir. School is however abruptly interrupted when Vasile an Ilioaei is lassoed off the street and forcefully drafted into the Moldavian military. After spending some time being tutored by teacher Iordache, whom the text depicts as a drunk, a sudden outbreak of cholera kills his teacher and pushes Smaranda and »òtefan to send their child out of the village. NicƒÉ follows the path of transhumance and is assigned to the care of shepherds, but he himself falls ill with what the narrator claims was cholera, and, upon returning home with a high fever, is instantly cured with a folk remedy of vinegar and lovage. A while after, claiming insolvency, »òtefan withdraws his son from school. Owing to Smaranda's persistence, the child follows his maternal grandfather David CreangƒÉ to Bro»ôteni, where he and his cousin Dumitru are enlisted in a more affordable establishment. This requires adaptation on the part of NicƒÉ and Dumitru, both of whom weep once their long hair is shaved off on the new teacher's orders. They are both hosted by a middle-aged woman, Irinuca, in a small house on the Bistri»õa, where their proximity to goats results in a scabies infection. CreangƒÉ then recounts how, while attempting to cure themselves with frequent baths in the river, he and his cousin dislodged a cliff which rolled down and tore through Irinuca's household. After leaving Bro»ôteni in a hurry and spending a while in Borca, the two children hasten for David CreangƒÉ's home in Pipirig. After an eventful trip through the Eastern Carpathians, the two boys arrive in the village, where they are welcomed by David's wife Nastasia. She cures their scabies using another local remedy, birch extract. Second chapter Introductory section of the Childhood Memories second chapter, in its manuscript form The second section opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously begins with the words: \\"I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for myself, when I start thinking about my birthplace, Humule»ôti, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels at the end of it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when I was learning to walk with my head held high, the place on top of the stove where I used to hide when we children played at hide-and- seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!\\" The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, NicƒÉ believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye. The narrator also mentions his regret at not having shown his mother his full appreciation, and refers to childhood as \\"the merry age\\". This introduction is followed by CreangƒÉ's rendition of interactions between his father, depicted as aloof and moody, but often amused by his boy's misbehaving, and his mother, who supervises the children directly and criticizes »òtefan for not following her lead. Indicating that he deserved the often severe punishments applied by his parents, the narrator then details his mischievousness and antics. He recounts his participation in the customs related to Saint Basil's feast (modern New Year's Day), fashioning a pig's bladder into a rattle and joining buhai players in celebrations as noisy as to irritate the settled villagers. The story also shows NicƒÉ greedily consuming all the milk his mother leaves out for souring and trying to blame it on the strigoi spirits, or bothering Chiorpec the shoemaker to the point where the aging man would punish him by covering his face in terpene. In summer, the boy plans a ruse to steal cherries from his uncle's property, and makes his way into the orchard by pretending to be looking for a cousin. Caught red-handed by his aunt and chased by her through a hemp plot, he manages to escape when she gets tangled in the plants. NicƒÉ decides to steal the hoopoe. 1892 illustration by Theodor Buiucliu Another such episode details the boy's trip on the outskirts of the village, sent over to provide food for the Romani day laborers hired by »òtefan and Smaranda. This episode sees the boy's unsupervised encounter with the village hoopoe (or \\"Armenian cuckoo\\"). Miserable over having to wake up early every morning to the sound of the bird, NicƒÉ exercises his revenge by trapping the bird inside her nest, a time-consuming process which drives the awaiting and isolated laborers to despair. Met with much hostility by his father's employees when he ultimately reaches his destination, the boy makes his way back to the hoopoe's lime tree and easily ties up the exhausted bird, hiding her in the attic of his house, where it no longer can sing. His deed proves detrimental to the entire community, deprived of its alarm clock, and rumors quickly spread that NicƒÉ is responsible. While Smaranda decides whether she should trust these reports, the boy assesses that his best choice is to sell the hoopoe at the fair. He proceeds to do so, but his entire scheme crumbles once a sly old man, pretending to assess the bird, releases it from its bonds. As the bird flies back to her nest, NicƒÉ angrily demands reparation. He is instead ridiculed by the old man, who informs him that »òtefan is also attending the fair and might be interested in the conversation, thus exposing the boy and prompting him to rush out of the market in fear of more severe repercussion. After a few paragraphs in which he focuses on the serendipitous nature of such outcomes, which serve him to avert producing further damage, CreangƒÉ moves on to describe his first employment: pulled out of school by »òtefan, the boy is enlisted in the village's textile trade, and becomes a spinner. It is there that he meets MƒÉriuca, a daughter his age, for whom he develops a sympathy. She jokingly assigns him the nickname Ion TorcƒÉlƒÉu (\\"Ion the Spinster\\"), which causes him some embarrassment for being shared with a Romani man, and therefore crossing a traditional ethnic divide. NicƒÉ is shown to be enjoying the work despite the fact that it is traditionally performed by women, but he is irritated by additional tasks such as babysitting his youngest sibling. Disobeying his mother's word, the boy leaves the cradle unattended and runs away to bathe in the river. After recounting the superstitious rituals performed by children during such escapades (such as dripping water from one's years onto stones, of which one is God's and the other the Devil's), the narrator describes being caught in the act by Smaranda, who punishes him by taking hold of all his clothes and leaving him to return naked through the village. This he manages following an elaborate route, from one hiding place to another, and avoiding being bitten by angry dogs by standing absolutely still for a long interval. After reaching his house, the narrator indicates, \\"I tidied up and cleaned the house as well as any grown-up girl\\", a behavior earning praises from his mother. The chapter ends with another overview, itself concluded with the words: \\"I myself was placed on this Earth like a clay figure endowed with eyes, a handful of animated humus from Humule»ôti, who's never been handsome before age twenty, wise before age thirty, nor rich before age forty. But neither was I ever as poor as I was this year, last year and throughout life!\\" Third chapter The first section of the book's third chapter follows up on the \\"handful of animated humus\\" metaphor, restructuring it as the point of departure for an imaginary dialogue the writer carries out with himself. It offers additional detail on the general history of Humule»ôti, an account leading as far back as the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War of 1672‚Äì1676, and briefly mentioning the passage of Austrians on their quest to find the beautiful princess Natalia (events which the writer claims to have witnessed himself). This exposition leads the narrator to conclude that the place of his birth \\"do not live like a bear in its lair\\". His statement serves to introduce the next period in NicƒÉ's life: his reenlistment in school, which this time around is a new institution founded on the orders of Moldavian Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, and presided upon by theologian Isaia \\"Popa Duhu\\" Teodorescu. There follows a detailed rendition of Ghica's opening speech, as witnessed by CreangƒÉ himself. The story then focuses on Teodorescu, his methods for teaching arithmetic rules such as cross-multiplication, and his apparent despondency when faced with students such as NicƒÉ O»ôlobanu (depicted as unruly and egotistic). This attitude leads to conflict between Teodorescu and parson Niculai O»ôlobanu, the boy's father. Enhanced by a quarrel over theological and administrative matters, it culminates with O»ôlobanu and his subordinate monks chasing Teodorescu out of their establishment. The narrative then focuses on CreangƒÉ's time at the seminary (catechism school) in FƒÉlticeni, where, to his confessed surprise, he reunites with NicƒÉ O»ôlobanu. CreangƒÉ's entry into the school follows the discovery that all his close friends were moving out of Teodorescu's school and leaving him directly exposed to the teacher's severity. He ultimately persuades his father to bribe seminary teachers with gifts, noting that such presents could effectively spare a student from all learning effort. Parts of the text however insists on the teaching methods employed by the seminary, which involve learning by heart and chanting elements of Romanian grammar or entire works of commentary on the Bible, and lead the narrator to exclaim: \\"A terrible way to stultify the mind, God alone knows!\\" Living far from parental supervision and sharing a house with some of his colleagues and their landlord Pavel the cobbler, the young man pursues a bohemian lifestyle and is introduced to the drinking culture. The narrator sketches portraits of his friends, based on their defining abilities or moods: the old man Bodr√¢ngƒÉ, who entertains the group with flute songs; O»ôlobanu, a man of the mountain, can lift and carry a cartload of logs on his back; the handsome David, whose early death is attributed by the writer to excessive effort in learning; the irreverent MirƒÉu»õƒÉ, who taunts Jewish businessmen with antisemitic poems, but spends little time on schoolwork; TrƒÉsnea, who can only learn grammar by memorizing the entire textbook, and who is much upset by the recent replacement of Romanian Cyrillic in favor of a Latin alphabet; Zaharia \\"G√¢tlan\\" Simionescu, a flatterer who can persuade adults to tolerate his daring gestures; Buliga, a priest given to drinking and merrymaking, who is depicted blessing the group's parties. The noisy men tour pubs in and outside the city, their escapades being marked by rudeness, womanizing and even shoplifting. The writer also makes vague mention of his relationship with the daughter of a priest, who becomes his first lover. CreangƒÉ's account also focuses on practical jokes, used by him and others as punishment for friends he believed were not reciprocal in sharing their Christmas supplies. These involve \\"posts\\", contraptions which are designed to singe one's toes during sleep, and their application manages to alienate the victims, who leave the house on by one. However, the final such attempt produces a scuffle between the two camps, so loud that neighbors mistaken it for a fire or an attack by the Austrian troops stationed in FƒÉlticeni (a military presence concomitant to the Crimean War and a Moldavian interregnum). This ends when all young men are evicted from the house, CreangƒÉ himself moving in with a local smith. In spring, it becomes apparent that the FƒÉlticeni school is to be closed down, and its students moved to the Socola Monastery in Ia»ôi. The chapter ends with mention of the uncertainty gripping students: some decide to attempt their chances in Socola by the start of a new school year, while others abandon their career prospects. Fourth chapter The Siret River, which runs across Moldavia The fourth and final chapter of Childhood Memories opens with CreangƒÉ's depiction of his own doubts at having to leave Humule»ôti for the more distant Ia»ôi: \\"A bear will not dance of its own accord.\\" The narrator uses this as a pretext to describe the things most dear to him in Humule»ôti: the landscape (\\"the smooth-flowing crystal-clear Ozana, wherein the Neam»õ Citadel has sadly been mirroring its face for so many centuries!\\"), his family and companions, and the local customs related to partying and dancing. His plans about staying home or becoming a monk are shattered by his mother Smaranda, who angrily invokes her ancestors' reputation in persuading him to leave for Socola and make a name for himself as a married priest. The narrative focus then covers the trip from Humule»ôti to the Moldavian capital: CreangƒÉ and G√¢tlan are passengers in the horse-drawn wagon of Luca, their neighbor and family friend. The narrator recounts sense of his shame and frustration upon noticing that Luca's \\"steeds\\" are actually \\"weak and scraggy\\" horses, and the despondency which grips him and Zaharia in front of the unknown. This sentiment is enhanced by the remarks of passers-by, which refer to the poor state of Luca's belongings and gain in sarcasm as the three travelers approach their destination. The account includes the writer's impressions of the Moldavian landscape, and his stated preference for the mountainous landscape of the west, which the cart was leaving behind, to the areas over the Siret River (where, according to Luca, \\"the water's bad and wood is scarce; in summer you're smothered with heat and the mosquitoes are an awful torment\\"). The chapter and volume end abruptly with a description of students from all Moldavian schools gathering into the Socola Monastery yard. Publication history CreangƒÉ's Childhood Memories are, with his portrait of Isaia Teodorescu (eponymously titled Popa Duhu), one of his memoirs, complementing his contributions in the fairy tale and anecdote.Vianu, p.207 The four chapters were produced in several consecutive sessions of writing, separated by lengthy intervals, and were first published as distinct texts. The fourth part was left unfinished by the author's illness and eventual death.Vianu, p.211 Each chapter was the product of an extensive work on the part of the author: by the time its first draft versions began circulating, the author was already known in the literary community for his laborious approach to the process of writing (as notably documented by the contemporary account of experimental psychologist Eduard Gruber). Gabriela Ursachi, \\"Decembrie\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 50/2004 CreangƒÉ would at times read the individual texts, like his other writings, in front of a public constituted from the members of Junimea literary society (some of whom were Iacob Negruzzi, Vasile Pogor and Alexandru Lambrior). The individual texts, including the posthumously-published fourth section, were first hosted by various issues of the Junimea magazine Convorbiri Literare beginning 1881. The first chapter in its original fragmentary version and the subsequent Romanian versions of the whole book open with CreangƒÉ's words: Dedica»õie d-»ôoarei L. M. (\\"A dedication to Mrs. L. M.\\"). This is a reference to Livia, daughter of CreangƒÉ's mentor and Junimea leader Titu Maiorescu, who probably copied and proofread his manuscript text. Augustin Z. N. Pop, \\"Livia Maiorescu-Dymsza despre Eminescu, Caragiale »ôi Titu Maiorescu\\" , in Cronica Rom√¢nƒÉ, May 9, 2003 The last and incomplete section was probably written during 1889.Ornea, p.236; Vianu, p.212 This was at a time when CreangƒÉ was no longer affiliated with Junimea, and had ended his relationship with Maiorescu; the text was therefore read in front Nicolae Beldiceanu's literary club, a venue frequented by him and Gruber.Vianu, p.212 The entire text was first published in book form as a section of the incomplete CreangƒÉ reader, edited by Gruber, A. D. Xenopol and Grigore Alexandrescu in 1892 (upon the bequest of the writer's son Constantin). The second such edition was included in the first-ever complete edition of CreangƒÉ's work, published between 1902 and 1906 by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu.Vianu, p.212-213 The product of CreangƒÉ's work is noted for its relatively isolated linguistic context, often relying on obscure elements in the Romanian lexis by adopting colloquial, antiquated, Moldavian dialectal or specifically rural speech patterns.Anca Mure»ôan, \\"The Stylistics of the Parts of the Speech in Memories of Childhood\\", in the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu's American, British and Canadian Studies, Vol. V, December 2004 Such elements have made Childhood Memories a problematic book for translations into other languages. A Romanian-to-English topical comparison made by academic Anca Mure»ôan cautioned: \\"CreangƒÉ's local and popular language poses diverse and serious difficulties to a translator. Among the lexical problems, special mention should be made of CreangƒÉ's use of numerous terms related to rural life and system, to church service, superstition and so on.\\" Structure, genre and style Conventional aspects and subjective account Much critical attention retrospectively focused on the measure of difference between, on one hand, the originality and subjectivity in Ion CreangƒÉ's first-person narrative and, on the other, their debt to the affixed conventions of traditional literary discourse. George CƒÉlinescu, the influential interwar critic and literary historian, argued that the writing appealed to traditional storytelling, lacking in individuality, and therefore dissimilar to \\"a confession or a diary.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p.481; Manea, p.275 Instead, he believed, the Memories outline \\"the childhood of the universal child.\\" Assessing that the book adapts the characteristics of oral tradition and frame narratives leading back to Renaissance literature, CƒÉlinescu also saw them mainly as a testing ground for the author's soliloquy and an illustration of his abilities as a raconteur.CƒÉlinescu, p.481 He argued: \\"The stories are true, but typical, without depth. Once retold with a different kind of gesticulation, the subject would lose all of its lively atmosphere.\\" In contrast, CƒÉlinescu's contemporary and colleague Tudor Vianu argued: \\"The character in [CreangƒÉ's] stories, novellas and anecdotes recounts himself Childhood Memories, a work so not like folk narratives in its intent.\\"Vianu, p.220 In reference to the similarities between the text and the Renaissance tradition, Vianu also noted: \\"The idea of fictionalizing oneself, of outlining one's formative steps, the steady accumulation of impressions from life, and then the sentiment of time, of its irreversible flow, of regret for all things lost in its consumption, of the charm relived through one's recollections are all thoughts, feelings and attitudes defining a modern man of culture. No popular model could have ever stood before CreangƒÉ when he was writing his Memories, but, surely, neither could the cultured prototypes of the genre, the first autobiographies and memoirs of the Renaissance\\". According to his interpretation: \\"Here, as in his stories and novellas, CreangƒÉ effects the passage from the popular level of literature to its cultured level, following a strictly spontaneous path by organically developing a talent exercised throughout the past of an old rural culture, now reaching a point where it surpasses itself.\\" Such themes were also present in later critical commentary. In a 2000 article, essayist and novelist Norman Manea builds on CƒÉlinescu's conclusions to assert that the \\"stable\\", \\"serene\\" and \\"solar\\" narrator of Childhood Memories \\"does not even exist outside [his] unveiling of an enchanted, traditional, rigorous concreteness\\".Manea, p.275 Referring to a text by critic Mircea Mo»õ, who found Childhood Memories to be \\"one of the saddest works in Romanian literature\\", literary chronicler and essayist Gheorghe Grigurcu himself assessed that the work evidenced \\"a tension between the individual as a holographic representative of the structure to whom he belongs and the written universe, intuitively a profane space, a vague imitation of the demiurgic act, and therefore a sacrilege.\\" Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Ion CreangƒÉ √Æntre naturƒÉ »ôi culturƒÉ\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 44/2004 Writing in 2008, literary historian Nicolae Manolescu argued that the Memories volume evidenced \\"CreangƒÉ's genius\\", which was linked to \\"the na√Øve and carefree register of childhood\\", and therefore implicitly superior to all his other works in prose. Iulian Boldea, \\"Istoria literaturii ca voca»õie »ôi provocare\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 1/2009 The second part's opening (where the narrator refers to his childhood games, to his mother's pets, and to his household oven) has reputedly become one of the best known fragments in Romanian literature.Manea, p.274-275 Manea notes that, through this section of prose, CreangƒÉ managed to \\"perfectly\\" convey both the \\"spatial and timely positioning\\" of his account, \\"as well as all the details of an ingenuous and restless universe\\".Manea, p.274 He contrasts this perspective with another first-person fragment: the opening of Adventures in Immediate Unreality by the interwar novelist Max Blecher, which directly plunges the reader into a universe of modernist uncertainty, subjectivity and suffering.Manea, p.275-276 Various commentators of the text have focused on the measure of difference between CreangƒÉ's account and the actual details of his biography, in particular life within »òtefan's family. According to George CƒÉlinescu, the Moldavian writer actually grew up in a single-parent household, raised only by his mother Smaranda, who may never have been legally married to »òtefan.CƒÉlinescu, p.478 CreangƒÉ's biographer Dan GrƒÉdinaru believes the narrative to reveal NicƒÉ as \\"a loner\\", and, using psychoanalytical terminology, sees the entire volume as proof of \\"dethronement complex\\" and an excessive focus on maternal love. Lumini»õa Marcu, \\"O monografie spectaculoasƒÉ\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 21/2000 Such approaches have received negative comments from critic Lumini»õa Marcu, who discussed CƒÉlinescu's \\"deformity\\" of interpreting writers through their work, without separating contexts, and judged GrƒÉdinaru's comments as proof a \\"mania of Freudianisms.\\" Historical record CreangƒÉ's portrayal of the childhood universe as a timeless reality, like his emphasis on tradition, relate to the characteristics of his native village and surrounding region. In Norman Manea's view, the \\"perfectly recognizable\\" narrative setting points to \\"repetitive cycles\\". Focusing on the description of Humule»ôti found in the opening lines, historian Neagu Djuvara commented: \\"even if we take into account that the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, how could we not recognize the sincerity in CreangƒÉ's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?\\"Djuvara, p.226 Djuvara used the fragment to discuss the structure of Romanian rural society in Moldavia, made relatively wealthy by textile enterprises, in comparison to its counterpart in the southern region of Wallachia, concluding: \\"if the mud hut villages of the Danube flood plain are to be taken into account, one finds himself in a different country.\\"Djuvara, p.226-227 Folklorist and critic Marcu Berza took the book as a record of Romanian folklore, its varieties and its reception, noting that the episode in which buhai players are chased away by angered householders shows that some peasants preferred a quieter celebration to what was in effect an echo of pagan fertility rites.Marcu Berza, Paganism in Roumanian Folklore, Swedenborg Press, New York, 2007, p.9. A topic of interest for critic Mugura»ô Constantinescu was the regulatory status of old men and women within a Moldavian community in the context of social change, as disclosed by the Childhood Memories text. She describes David CreangƒÉ as a \\"clan leader\\" and \\"enlightened man\\", guided by \\"the wisdom and balance of the ripe age\\", who, although illiterate, is able to understand the value of providing his grandson with a formal education.Constantinescu, p.62 According to Constantinescu: \\"[David's] common sense is also apparent in the field of religious belief, where, as any good Christian in a Romanian village of the mid 19th century, he takes mass and behaves like a practicing Christian, but does not encourage his wife's bigotry.\\" The unnamed old man who cheats NicƒÉ out of his hoopoe, Constantinescu writes, is a figure among those who educate young CreangƒÉ by resorting to \\"farce\\" instead of a stern lesson in morals. Other figures she considers relevant for this analysis are Chiorpec the shoemaker, Bodr√¢ngƒÉ the performer and the various old women who function as healers.Constantinescu, p.62-63 Ion CreangƒÉ's depiction of seminary life and teaching methods has also been linked by literary critics with the larger aspects of his personal worldview. Z. Ornea finds the narrator's outbursts against the practice of learning by heart to innovative choices CreangƒÉ made in his own career as an educator, and especially his support for Titu Maiorescu's theories on reforming the local curriculum through institutional modernization and professionalization.Ornea, p.235-236 Himself a writer, Horia G√¢rbea discussed the text as proof of anticlericalism on the part of CreangƒÉ (whose career in the clergy was to end in defrocking), adding: \\"CreangƒÉ's Memories of the catechist school would discourage any candidate.\\"Horia G√¢rbea, Trecute vie»õi de fan»õi »ôi de birlici, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 2008, p.127-128. Tributes and influence Childhood Memories first became a source for inspiration for various Romanian authors during the early 20th century and the interwar period. It was imitated by I. Dragoslav in his own 1909 work, Povestea copilƒÉriei (\\"The Tale of Childhood\\")‚Äîcalled \\"a disgraceful pastiche\\" by CƒÉlinescu.CƒÉlinescu, p.726 The same critic also discussed the Romanian theater adaptation a Childhood Memories chapter by writer I. I. Mironescu, as Catihe»õii de la Humule»ôti (\\"The Catechists from Humule»ôti\\")‚Äîdeeming it \\"superfluous\\" to CreangƒÉ's already \\"dramatic\\" text.CƒÉlinescu, p.785 Nicolae Manolescu identified an additional product of CreangƒÉ's influence as a memoirist in CopilƒÉria unui netrebnic (\\"The Childhood of a Ne'er-do-well\\"), a 1936 novel by the avant-garde author Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru. Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Romane uitate\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 34/2006 More interest in the text came later in the century, during Romania's communist period. A number of new editions of the book saw print at the time, including ones published by the new and eponymous state-run publishing house, Editura Ion CreangƒÉ.Arina Stoenescu, \\"All Those Images\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 30/2007 Some of these were leading Romanian graphic artists: a 1959 volume with 14 drawings by Eugen Taru (the originals of which form a permanent exhibit at CreangƒÉ's memorial house in Humule»ôti) Florin Rusu, \\"Bijuteria de pe Valea Ozanei\\", in Evenimentul, May 18, 2002 and another one with plates by L√≠via Rusz, in both black-and-white and color.

Overview of Sphaeralcea (Malvaceae) in southern Utah and northern Arizona, USA, and description of a new species. Novon 12(2) 159-166.  Description  Sphaeralcea gierischii is a perennial plant. It produces clumps of dark reddish purple stems up to about a meter tall with a few bright green, lobed leaves. The flowers have petals up to 2.5 centimeters long. They are orange, or sometimes described as \\"grenadine\\".  Distribution and habitat  There are only five known occurrences, with 90% of the population located within Mohave County, Arizona. It is threatened by open-pit mining for gypsum. The single occurrence in Utah is also threatened by off-road vehicle use and dumping. Ecology Associated species include creosote bush, blackbrush, saltbush, yucca, ragweed, ephedra, rabbitbrush, prairie-clover, James' galleta, cheesebush, Anderson's desert thorn, prickly pear, indigo bush, and cliffrose. The plant is nearly an obligate gypsophile, mainly limited to the gypsum soils of the Kaibab Limestone; it has also been seen on limestone soils. The gypsum is sought after and extensively mined in the area by a process that involves removing the top layer of rock, mining the gypsum-rich deeper layers, and filling the pit with the rubble of the top layer. This process is very destructive to the local habitat.  Conservation  In 2012, it was proposed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act.Gierisch mallow (Sphaeralcea gierischii). US Fish and Wildlife Service Species Profile. In 2013 it was granted endangered status.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-08-13/pdf/2013-19385.pdf Since 2011, Red Butte Garden's Conservation Department in Salt Lake City, Utah, has been conducting germination, propagation, and transplant studies at a site in Arizona, just South of St. George, UT.

In addition, the history of crude oil extraction and use, particularly in the region around Wietze, is vividly portrayed. On a site of about in size, old and modern technical installations used for extraction, prospecting and refining crude oil are exhibited. Occasionally there are mining shows at which objects associated with mining, minerals and fossils may be swapped, bought or sold. Wietze and crude oil The village of Wietze has played a special role in the history of crude oil extraction. As early as the 17th century, crude oil from mineral deposits at Wietze was scooped from tar pits on the surface and used as a grease and medicament. In 1858 one of the first boreholes in the world for the extraction of oil was sunk here. From 1920 to 1963 oil was also extracted from underground mines.

During the 1948 Palestine war, it was mostly abandoned and later destroyed. After Israel's establishment in 1948, the area became part of south Tel Aviv. Officially named Giv'at Herzl (, lit. Herzl's hill), the name of an adjacent Jewish neighborhood, the name Abu Kabir () continued to be used. Part or all of Abu Kabir was officially renamed Tabitha by the Tel Aviv municipality in 2011. History Sabil Abu Nabbut Egyptian rule The Egyptian troops of Ibrahim Pasha captured the city of Jaffa and its environs following a battle with the forces of the Ottoman Empire in 1832. Though Egyptian rule over this area continued only until 1840, Egyptian Muslims settled in and around Jaffa, founding the village of Sakhanat Abu Kabir, along with Sakhanat al-Muzariyya, among others. An eastern suburb of Jaffa, many of the Egyptians who populated it came from the village of Tall al Kabir (or Tel Abu Kabir), and named it for their hometown. Ottoman period An Ottoman village list of about 1870 described Saknet Abu Kebir as a \\"Beduin camp\\", with 136 houses and a population of 440, though the population count included men only. In The Survey of Western Palestine (1881), its name is recorded as S√¢knet Abu Keb√Ær and it is translated as, \\"The settlement of Abu Kebir p.n.; (great father).\\" Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, the French archaeologist, visited in 1873-1874, searching for the site of the ancient Jewish cemetery of Joppa (Jaffa). He describes \\"Saknet Abu K'bir\\" as a hamlet, and relates walking through the \\"extensive gardens that close in Jaffa on every side\\" to reach it. He notes that during the heavy winter rains, the gardens between Jaffa and Saknet Abu Kabir became a small marshy lake that was known as al- Bassa by the locals. Noting that this name is commonly used throughout Syria for seasonal ponds of this nature and recalling that the bissah of the Hebrew Bible also means pond, he suggests that the similarity in the Arabic and Hebrew indicates a borrowing from even earlier linguistic traditions.Clermont- Ganneau, p. 157-8. Under an entry entitled The Jewish necropolis of Joppa, Clermont-Ganneau relates that after inquiring with the local fellahin (peasants) in Abu Kabir, he was led \\"a few yards further on\\" from the hamlet, \\"in the middle of some poorly tilled gardens,\\" where building stone was quarried by the villagers. Laid bare by their activities were, \\"sepulchral chambers hollowed out in the calcareous tufa.\\" He notes that similar graves were said to found in the lands between Abu Kabir to as far as Mikveh Israel and the Catholic cemetery. Other fellahin told him of finds between Saknet Abu Kabir and Saknet al-'Abid, and still others told of artifacts that they had retrieved from them. One artifact was brought to him which he purchased: a small marble titulus with a four-line Greek inscription and a seven-branched candlestick (or menorah). Clermont-Ganneau identified this as Helleno-Jewish funeral epigraphy, ascribing it to Hezekiah, and writes that it, \\"settled once and for all the nature of the burial ground I had just discovered.\\" In a letter published by the Palestine Exploration Fund, he expressed his hope to return noting, \\"We must at least find two or three more inscriptions of the same kind coming from the same neighbourhood.\\" Locating the tombs within a circle called, \\"Ardh (or Jebel) Dhabitha,\\" he notes the area extends over, \\"the great gardens outside Jaffa, bounded by a little hamlet called Abou K'bir* (Abu Kebir), and by the well of Aboa Nabbout (Abu Nabbut).\\" The Jewish necropolis was looted mainly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dating the site is a challenge due to the lack of objects found in situ, but estimates are that the tombs were used between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD. Most of the necropolis is now in the area of the Russian Orthodox Saint Peter's Church compound. According to Mark LeVine, the Biluim pioneers set up a commune among the orange and lemon groves of the Abu Kabir neighborhood between 1882 and 1884. The house used by the commune members is now located in the Neve Ofer neighborhood of Tel Aviv. British Mandate period Historic Arab house in Abu Kabir During the 1921 Jaffa Riots, the violence reached Abu Kabir. The Jewish Yitzker family owned a dairy farm on the outskirts of the neighborhood, in which they rented out rooms. At the time of the riots, Yosef Haim Brenner, one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew literature was living at the site. On May 2, 1921, despite warnings Yitzker and Brenner refused to leave the farm and were murdered, along with Yitzker's teenaged son, his son- in-law and two other renters. As Jaffa expanded during the 1920s and 1930s, Abu Kabir was incorporated within the municipal boundaries of Jaffa but retained much of its agricultural character.Arnon Golan (2009), War and Postwar Transformation of Urban Areas: The 1948 War and the Incorporation of Jaffa into Tel Aviv, Journal of Urban History, It consisted of a main built- up part bordering the Jewish sector of Jaffa from the south, and several small concentrations of houses within the surrounding citrus groves. In the wake of violence on the border between Jaffa and Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv's leaders suggested annexing the Jewish neighborhoods of Jaffa to Tel Aviv. They proposed that the whole of Manshiyya, including Hassan Bey Mosque, as well as large parts of the Abu Kabir neighborhood, be transferred to the borders of the new Jewish city and state.\\" On August 23, 1944, the British Criminal Investigation Department (CID) barracks at Jaffa, and police stations at Abu Kabir and Neve Shaanan were raided for arms by the Irgun. 1947‚Äì1948 war Church in Abu Kabir In 1947, Abu Kabir was situated at the entrance to Tel Aviv on the main road to Jerusalem.Yigal Allon, native son: a biography, Anita Shapira and Evelyn Abelalong, p. 182. On 30 November 1947, the day after the UN voted on the Partition Plan, an Arab mob in Abu Kabir attacked a car with Jewish passengers, killing all three. Jewish retaliatory strikes followed. On 2 December the Haganah's Kiryati Brigade blew up an Arab house in Abu Kabir, and the IZL torched several buildings four days later, killing at least two persons. During Operation Lamed Hey (Hebrew for \\"35\\"), named for the 35 casualties of an attack on the Convoy of 35, Abu Kabir was raided to \\"cleanse it of the forces acting there.\\" On the night of 12‚Äì13 February 1948, the Haganah struck simultaneously at Abu Kabir, Jibalia, Tel a-Rish and the village of Yazur. At Abu Kabir, 13 Arabs were killed, including the Mukhtar, and 22 injured. According to the Palestine Post, on 16 February 1948 The Haganah repulsed an Arab attack on Tel Aviv from Abu Kabir. A second major attack on Abu Kabir was launched on 13 March, the objective of which was, \\"the destruction of the Abu Kabir neighborhood\\". By this time the neighborhood was mostly abandoned by its inhabitants and was guarded by a few dozen militiamen. Sappers blew up a number of houses and this was the first attack in which Yishuv-produced Davidka mortars were used to shell the neighborhood. Inaccurate and very loud, the mortars had a demoralizing effect claimed to have reached \\"as far as Gaza\\". A month after Abu Kabir was conquered, David Ben-Gurion told the Israeli Provisional Government that Jaffa's Arab population should not be allowed to return: \\"If there will be [an] Abu Kebir again - this would be impossible. The world needs to understand we are 700,000 against 27 million, one against forty ... It won't be acceptable to us for Abu Kebir to be Arab again.\\" Walid Khalidi writes that the Haganah completed the demolition of Abu Kabir by March 31. On April 19, 1948, The Palestine Post reported that \\"In the Abu Kebir area, the Haganah dispersed Arabs who tried to erect an emplacement facing the Aka factory in Givat Herzl. Two Arabs were shot as they approached the Maccabi Quarter.\\"The Palestine Post, April 19, 1948. State of Israel Abu Kabir detention center After 1948, Abu Kabir was renamed Giv'at Herzl, although the Arabic name, Abu Kabir, is still used by the now largely Hebrew speaking population.About the map of Tel Aviv and its Palestinian villages , ZochrotLife After Baghdad, Sasson Somekh The Tel Aviv Municipality offered Prof. Heinrich Mendelssohn, Director of the Biological-Pedagogical Institute, the option of moving the Institute to Abu Kabir, and it was moved into a structure originally planned as a hospital. Haim Levanon, Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv in the early 1950s and mayor from 1953‚Äì59 energetically campaigned for the founding of a university in Tel Aviv. The idea was realized on August 16, 1953, when the Municipal Council of Tel Aviv-Yafo decided to transform the Biological-Pedagogical Institute into the Academic Institute of Natural Sciences, under the leadership of Prof. Mendelssohn, which would \\"form the core of a future university.\\" The Abu Kabir campus in southern Tel Aviv had 24 students in its first year. In 1954, the Academic Institute of Jewish Studies was established in Abu Kabir. A university library was also founded, new study tracks were opened, a teaching staff was formed, laboratories and classrooms were built, and an administration established for the campus. The L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine, locally known as the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, was established that year. In 1956, the Academic Institutes were officially upgraded into the new \\"University of Tel Aviv\\". The Zoological Gardens became part of the University. The Zoological and Botanical Gardens were moved to the Ramat Aviv campus in 1981. The Nature Gardens still host the original facilities. The gardens at Abu Kabir are recommended in an Israeli guide to Tel Aviv as a destination for nature lovers.Tel Aviv: General Info In the tour book Israel and the Palestinian territories (1998), \\"the former village of Abu Kabir\\" is described as being located in a green space to the east of Jaffa.

However, the SKIF in France didn't disband, but in 1963 changed its name to Club la√Øque de l‚ÄôEnfance juive, CLEJ. S.K.I.F. in Poland In Interwar Poland and in Occupied Poland, various members of the Jewish Resistance were or had been associated with S.K.I.F. One of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Marek Edelman had been a S.K.I.F. member, as were members of the underground Jewish Fighting Organization Boruch Pelc and Jurek B≈Çones. Other notable Jewish members included the painter Yosl Bergner, the RAF pilot Rubin Lifszyc and the organizer of children's theater for the poor in the Warsaw Ghetto, Pola Lifszyc. Before World War II, S.K.I.F. organized summer camps for children. Marek Edelman, as a member of the organization, raised funds for playrooms for the children of the poor, in Warsaw. S.K.I.F. in Melbourne The S.K.I.F. in Melbourne, Australia, was established in 1950. The first five children held weekly \\"Sunday meetings\\". They still have these today, with approximately 25 children attending. By the fourth year of Melbourne SKIF camps, there were enough campers to operate two separate camps. The organisation now runs three camps a year (summer, winter and spring, which is for seniors only) and at its peak has an average camp attendance of eighty children. The final two years of membership are spent in an intensive training course to prepare those who wish to continue as leaders. Within the Melbourne Jewish Community, it is the only non-Zionist youth movement and the only one to sit outside of the umbrella organization of the Zionist Youth Council. Activities are focused more on broader topics to do with culture, (such as music appreciation,) rather than Israel and Jewish theology. Contrary to popular belief, the organisation is not anti-Zionist. Whilst a number of activities and names pay homage to the groups socialist, worker past; the SKIF of today has a membership base with a broader political and social orientation.

In Berlin, key dadaists such as Raoul Hausmann, George Grosz and Kurt Schwitters all started their careers as Expressionists, whilst in Switzerland, two of the founders of Dada, Hugo Ball and Hans Arp had formulated a number of key concepts embodied by Z√ºrich Dada, such as an affinity to abstract art and a belief in theatre 'bursting forth from the roots of all dramatic life' Der Blaue Reiter, Arnold Sch√∂nberg Center \\\\- in Munich as part of the group centred on Kandinsky at the time that Kl√§nge was published. Both Arp and Ball had been involved with Kandinsky's group Der Blaue Reiter before the First World War; Arp contributed to the first almanac and exhibited work in the second group exhibition, whilst Ball edited a second almanac with Kandinsky - Das Neue Theater (Almanac of New Theatre) - that was only abandoned due to the outbreak of World War I.

He was born in the town of Barnard, Vermont, on March 31, 1804, and was a son of Hathaway and Rachel Dean Richmond. His father moved the family to Syracuse, New York, where he was engaged in the early salt industry. His father died when Dean was only fourteen years of age. Richmond became involved with the passenger steamship business on the Hudson River in 1834, and was a member of the Hudson River Steamboat Association, a cartel which sought a monopoly on passenger traffic between New York City and Albany. He expanded the salt business and, in 1842, he moved to Buffalo, New York, where he established a commission and transportation business. With these businesses, he became one of the wealthiest and most influential citizens of the Great Lakes region. He became a director in the Utica and Buffalo Railroad Company and with the completion of the direct line to Batavia, he took up his residence there. With the establishment of the New York Central Railroad Company in 1853, he was chosen the first vice-president of the company, and held that position until 1864, when he was elected president upon the retirement of Erastus Corning. He was also elected president of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. He served as chairman of the Democratic State Committee from 1857 to his death in 1866. In the summer of 1866, after attending the State convention at Saratoga, he accompanied Samuel J. Tilden on a trip to Washington and Philadelphia. After returning to New York, on August 19, 1866, he was stricken with illness and died on August 27, 1866. He was buried in Batavia Cemetery. The Richmond Memorial Library, in Batavia, was a gift of Mrs. Mary E. Richmond, in memory of her son, Dean Richmond, Jr., who died in 1865. In 1861, as President-Elect Abraham Lincoln made his way to Washington, D.C., the engine that pulled the train was The Dean Richmond. In a gesture of bi-partisanship, Richmond, as chairman of the Democratic State Committee, boarded the train and had lunch with the Lincoln family as the train roared past Syracuse. On the leg of the journey from Albany to Buffalo the same engine that brought Lincoln to his inauguration pulled his funeral train. A Great Lakes freighter was also named after him. The freighter itself became famous when it sank in Lake Erie near the town of North East, Pennsylvania, on October 15, 1893.

The station is licensed to Refugio, Texas, United States, and serves the Corpus Christi area. KXAI is owned by the Educational Media Foundation. History The KXAI license went on the air as KCTA-FM 103.3, a 100,000-watt FM station licensed to Sinton, on May 20, 1968. Owned by the Broadcasting Company of the Southwest alongside its Corpus Christi station KCTA (1030 AM), the station broke from simulcasting its daytime-only AM partner and became country outlet KOUL on October 2, 1970. An agreement was reached to sell KOUL to J. W. Brauer in 1975, but the two parties mutually agreed to dismiss the sale attempt on February 12, 1976. KOUL moved to 103.7 MHz in the early 1980s as part of a multi-city allocation shuffle to resolve a conflict involving allocations in Freeport, and in 2005, it was approved to change its city of license from Sinton to Refugio in a move designed to allowed KTKY to upgrade its own facility. In 1997, Broadcast Corporation of the Southwest sold its three Corpus Christi FM stations and one AM to Harpole Broadcast Holdings of Texas in a $5.2 million transaction. Harpole sold the three FMs to Texrock Radio the next year for $7 million. 2001 saw another sale of the FMs, this time to Rodriguez Communications for $6.5 million. Sale to EMF and 2020 move to San Antonio On April 5, 2013, Tejas Broadcasting, which had become the owner of KOUL and other stations in 2004, announced it would sell KOUL to the Educational Media Foundation for $1.25 million; the deal included a $500,000 loan to Tejas that allowed it to build out two construction permits on its other stations in the market and perform deferred maintenance on the KOUL facility. On May 3, 2013, KOUL dropped its longtime country format and began broadcasting Air 1 programming, with new KXAI call letters instituted. Tejas would later exit broadcasting by selling one of those stations, KMJR (licensed to Odem), to EMF in 2019 for $432,000. With EMF in control of KMJR and KXAI, the company saw an opportunity. In partnership with Emmis Communications, owner of KBPA in the Austin market, a series of applications were filed. KXAI would move from Refugio to a new city of license, Balcones Heights, and broadcast with 4,300 watts of power‚Äîa relocation into the heart of the San Antonio metropolitan area, giving EMF a city-grade signal in San Antonio. To make the move possible, Emmis's KBPA would slightly downgrade its facility. Meanwhile, KMJR at 98.3 would move to 103.7 using KXAI's antenna. In January 2020, the relocation and other facilities changes were approved by the Federal Communications Commission.

Where known, the siphuncle tends to be central to subcentral. The Clydonautiloidea, name based on Hyatt's Clydonautilidae of 1900, are more or less the Liroceratina of Shimansky 1962. Classification and taxonomy The Clydonautiloidea, which began in the Late Devonian, combine five families, three of which are restricted to the Triassic. Principal and forming the root stock are the Late Devonian to Upper Triassic Liroceratidae, from which Shimankiy derived his suborder. Derived from the Liroceratidae in the Early Mississippian are this Mississippian to mid Permian Ephippioceratidae. The three Triassic families, derived from Triassic liroceratids, are the Clydonautilidae, Gonionautilidae, and Siberonautilidae, all with prominent lobes and saddles in the suture. The families are described as: The Clydonautilidae, named by Hyatt in 1900, were the first to be defined and provide the name for the superfamily. Clydonautilids are characterized by generally smooth, involute, globular to compressed shells with a very small to occluded (hidden) umbilicus and sutures with prominent lobes and saddles. Their range is from the mid to Upper Triassic. The Liroceratidae, named by Miller and Youngquist in 1949, are the ancestral family, which gave rise to the other four, and which has the longest duration, from the Upper Devonian to the Upper Triassic. The Liroceratidae are characterized by generally smooth shells with broadly rounded, depressed whorls, occluded umbilicus, slightly sinuous sutures, and a siphuncle that is usually more or less central. The Ephippioceratidae, named by Miller and Youngquist in 1949, which have a range from the Lower Carboniferous (Miss) to the Lower Permian, are closely similar to the Liroceratidae, but have deep ventral and dorsal saddles in the suture. The Gonionautlidae, named by Kummel in 1950 to contain the Upper Triassic genus Gonionautilus, have a smooth, involute, compressed shell with narrow flattened venter and a suture like that of Clydonautilus, but with a more highly developed median saddle and double-pointed annular lobes. The Siberionautilidae, named by Popov in 1951 for the Upper Triassic Siberionautilus, have an involute, finely ribbed, globular shell with flattened flanks that converge toward a rounded venter and a highly differentiated goniatitic suture. Origin and extinction The origin of the Clydonautiloidea (Liroceratidae) is unknown for sure, but is generally surmised as being from the Rutoceratidae, late in the Devonian. The Liroceratidae were the only clydonautilaceans living at the end of the Permian, when a significant number of nautilid genera perished, but enough survived to carry the family, and by inference the superfamily into the Triassic. Already reduced in number, although suddenly diverse, none of the Clydonautiloidea escaped the smaller extinction at the end of the Triassic.

He was the eighth and final member of the House of Contarini to serve as Doge of Venice (with the first being Domenico I Contarini, who became Doge in 1043). His reign was largely peaceful, as the Republic of Venice was still recovering from the defeat to the Ottoman Empire in the 1645‚Äì69 Cretan War. However, in the last days of Contarini's reign, hostilities with the Ottoman Empire were rekindled once again, and Venice soon entered the Sixth Ottoman-Venetian War, better known as the Morean War (1684‚Äì99). Biography Contarini was born in Venice as the third son of Nicol√≤ Contarini and Elena Michiel; he was a nephew of Francesco Contarini, the 95th Doge of Venice, who had a one-year reign from 1623 to 1624. Alvise Contarini never married, dedicating his whole life to public service. He served as Venice's ambassador to the Kingdom of France, Spain, the Dutch Republic, and to the Papal court. The King of France granted Contarini the title of chevalier. During his time as savio, Contarini supported the party in the Great Council that called for a continuation of the war with the Ottoman Empire. Upon the death of Nicol√≤ Sagredo on 14 August 1676, it seemed a foregone conclusion that he would be succeeded as Doge by his popular brother Giovanni Sagredo. Giovanni Sagredo quickly secured the votes of thirty of the forty electors. His opponents, however, believed he had used fraudulent means to do so, and they therefore rioted. Alarmed, the Great Council chose forty new electors, and when these electors met on 26 August 1676, they decided on Alvise Contarini as a compromise candidate. Most of Contarini's reign as Doge was occupied with festivities and fun, and he made little attempt to exercise strong dogal powers. Contarini did, however, oversee a major judicial reform in the early part of his reign. Also, many new relics were brought in from Crete (now under Ottoman control) and installed in Venetian churches during Contarini's reign. Several notable firsts occurred in Contarini's reign. On 25 June 1678, Venetian mathematician Elena Cornaro Piscopia became the first woman in the world to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree, from the University of Padua. In a first of a very different sort, Venice's first coffeehouse opened in 1683, and drinking coffee soon became immensely popular. In terms of foreign policy, these were anxious years for Venice. Venetians watched the progress of the Great Turkish War closely, as Venice's enemy, the Ottoman Empire, made territorial gains in the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy (including all of the Balkans by 1682) before finally being halted by the forces of John III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna on 12 September 1683. In Venice, debates about entering the war on the side of the Habsburgs dominated throughout 1683. Contarini died on 15 January 1684, shortly before Venice decided to enter the war in mid-1684, thus beginning the Morean War (1684-99). Alvise Contarini was buried in the Contarini family chapel in the church of San Francesco della Vigna. There is a bust of Alvise Contarini on his tomb.

Its remains have been found in western Liaoning, China. It was similar to other dromaeosaurids found in Liaoning, with the exception of being somewhat more primitive. The type specimen, formally named in 2009, shows features not seen in previously known Northern Hemisphere (Laurasian) dromaeosaurids, but present in Southern Hemisphere (Gondwanan) species and early birds. Because of this, the scientists who first studied Tianyuraptor described it as a \\"transitional species\\", bridging the gap between northern and southern types of dromaeosaurid. Tianyuraptor also differs from previously known dromaeosaurids in that it possesses a relatively small furcula (\\"wishbone\\"), and unusually short forelimbs. Etymology The generic name of Tianyuraptor combines Tianyu, referring to the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature where the holotype specimen is stored, with raptor, the Latin word for 'robber', referring to the action of grabbing prey, often used in naming dromaeosaurids. The specific epithet, ostromi, is in honor of John Ostrom, who contributed greatly to the study of dromaeosaurid fossils, including Deinonychus and feathered dinosaurs.\\"At Last, His Theory Flies\\". May 5, 2000. Olivia F. Gentile. Hartford Courant. Description Artist's life restoration Tianyuraptor is a medium-sized dromaeosaurid that has several derived features that separate it from other dromaeosaurids. These include the length of the middle caudal (tail) vertebrae being more than twice that of the dorsal (back) vertebrae, a small and extremely slender furcula, and an unusually long hindlimb that is roughly three times as long as the entire series of dorsal vertebrae. As in other dromaeosaurid fossils discovered in Liaoning, the tail is relatively long at , nearly 4.8 times as long as the femur. The type specimen is STM1‚Äì3, a nearly complete and fully articulated skeleton that is only missing the extreme distal end of the tail. A total of 25 fully articulated caudal vertebrae are preserved and at the end three at most are estimated to be missing. The fossil was discovered in the Dawangzhangzi Bed of the Yixian Formation (Jehol Group), located in Lingyuan in western Liaoning, China. The Yixian Formation is an Early Cretaceous rock unit, dated to between approximately 129.7 and 122.1 million years old, in the Barremian and Aptian faunal stages. The Dawangzhangzi Bed specifically has been dated to about 122 million years ago. STM1‚Äì3 is believed to be a sub-adult, with features including the incomplete fusion of skeletal parts during ontogeny. The holotype of Tianyuraptor preserves no soft tissues, unlike many other theropod specimens from the Jehol Group. Limbs The forelimbs are comparatively short, being only 53% of the hindlimbs' length. This differs greatly from the known skeletal elements of other dromaeosaurids, most of which have relatively long forelimbs that are more than 70% of the hindlimbs' length. While Tianyuraptor is larger in size than all other known microraptorines, it also has relatively elongated lower hindlimbs, like other microraptorines. In this regard, it is different from most other dromaeosaurids, which have relatively short lower legs.Currie, P. J. (1997). \\"Dromaeosauridae.\\" Pp. 194‚Äì195 in Currie, P.J. and Padian, K. (eds.) Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs. San Diego: Academic Press. For example, Tianyuraptor has a tibiotarsus/femur length ratio of greater than 1.30, while Velociraptor mongoliensis, a creature of similar size, exhibits a ratio of less than 1.10. Aside from elongate hind limbs, Tianyuraptor is different from other members of Microraptorinae in regards to the relative lengths of the forelimb elements. The forelimbs of Tianyuraptor are proportionally much shorter than those of larger dromaeosaurids. For example, a similar-sized Velociraptor specimen shows an arm/leg length ratio of approximately 0.75., while Tianyuraptor has an arm/leg ratio of 0.53. Paleobiology The stark difference in arm length compared to other dromaeosaurids implies that the function of the arms in Tianyuraptor was different from that of other dromaeosaurs. Members of the subfamily Microraptorinae, such as Microraptor, have been suggested to have been aerodynamic and may have glided. Microraptorines are usually noted for their long and robust forelimbs and large, asymmetrical flight feathers. However, the shortened forelimbs, small furcula, and the transversely wide coracoid in Tianyuraptor suggest that it was not suited for aerodynamic gliding or flight. Classification A phylogenetic analysis performed by Zheng et al. showed Tianyuraptor to be a basal member of a group containing Laurasian dromaeosaurids. Tianyuraptor seems to possess several features that are unknown in other Laurasian dromaeosaurids, but which are seen in basal avialans and Gondwanan dromaeosaurids, including Austroraptor, Buitreraptor, Neuquenraptor, Rahonavis, and Unenlagia. Zheng and colleagues also noted that Tianyuraptor shares some features with the monophyletic subfamily Microraptorinae, though they went on to say that this mixture of features suggests a basal placement for Tianyuraptor within Microraptorinae, as evidenced by their phylogenetic analysis which indicated maximum parsimony in six of the 30 results recovered by the analysis. The authors then go on to suggest that since Tianyuraptor is considered a short-armed microraptorine, more derived long-armed microraptorines might have independently evolved flight capability. However, it is also equally possible, as argued by Zheng et al., that Tianyuraptor may in fact be a basal member of a clade containing all other Laurasian dromaeosaurids with the exception of Microraptorinae. This is indicated by the other 24 out of 30 most parsimonious trees recovered from the analysis. The discovery of Tianyuraptor sheds new light on the early evolution of dromaeosaurs and further exemplifies the great diversity this group enjoyed at an early stage.

It is a working farm whose current form dates to the mid-19th century. The farm's main house shows the transition from the Greek Revival style to the Victorian modes that became dominant later in the century. It remained a farm in the hands of the same family until 2001, even as the area around it has become a suburb of nearby Pittsburgh. In 1979 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is currently owned by the township's historical society. Property The farmstead consists of 12 buildings on a parcel of land sloping gently to the west. Washington Road is to the east, Orr Road to the south, and a township park is on the north. The South Hills Village shopping mall is a short distance north on the opposite side of Washington. There are sidewalks on the streets and the property itself is fenced off. The main house is a two-story, three-bay structure of brick painted red. It is topped with a slate-shingled gabled roof. There is a large wing on the rear that has had an addition put on. A nearby stone springhouse is the oldest building on the farm. Windows have decorative wooden lintels and white pine moldings. A porch supported by wooden columns stretches across the west (front) of the first story. The main entrance has a red glass transom and similar sidelights with a frosted grape pattern. Inside many original finishings remain. The doors have white pine molded surrounds like their exterior counterparts, and one of the parlors has a fireplace mantel also of pine. Slate and marble are used for the other two fireplaces on the first story. A breezeway connects the main house to a brick wash house to its rear. It is also three bays but only one story high. To its rear is a smokehouse. Also nearby is a frame barn on a stone foundation. Its roof is pierced by two ventilators. Next to it is the stable, with stalls for seven horses. A wagon shed, shop, pig pen, chicken coop and granary round out the outbuildings. History The farm was established by Alexander Gilfillan in the 1760s. His family was one of the first to settle in the future township, growing corn, hay, sheep and cattle. His grandson, John II, built the current farm complex from 1857 to 1868. The last building, the barn, was built in a community barn raising. In 1976 the family sold the surrounding acreage to the township, which have since been developed as a park with a walking trail. The Gilfillan descendants continued to live on and work the farm until the last one died in 2001. Margaret Gilfillan left the property to the Historical Society of Upper St. Clair http://www.hsusc.org/ along with a $1.8 million trust fund to maintain it. Currently it is open to the public by appointment or on Upper St. Clair Community Day, in May of every year and the grounds are selectively available for private parties.

Origins  The Rouge Forum emerged from a series of political controversies within the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) during the 1990s. In particular, two events at the 1994 annual meeting of NCSS in Phoenix galvanized a small group of activists who later founded the organization. First, a staff person from the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors (CCCO) was arrested for leafleting at the NCSS conference; and secondly, the governing body of NCSS rejected a resolution condemning California Proposition 187 and calling for a boycott of California as a site for future meetings of the NCSS. These events fueled a level of political activism the NCSS had rarely experienced and identified the need for organized action in support of free speech and anti- racist pedagogy in the field of social studies education in general and within NCSS in particular.Gibson, R., Queen, G., Ross, E. W., & Vinson, K. D. (2007). \\"I Participate, You Participate, We Participate‚Ä¶\\" Notes on Revolutionary Educational Activism to Transcend Capital: The Rouge Forum.\\" Journal for Critical Educational Policy Studies, 5(2). The Rouge Forum was formally organized and held its first meeting in Detroit at Wayne State University in 1998 with around 300 education activists present. Continued activism within NCSS remained a major topic of discussion at this meeting, however, the organization's concerns were broadened by the participation of teachers and teachers educators working in the areas of literacy and special education. Rouge Forum members have worked closely with, and played leadership roles within the inclusive school and whole language literacy movements. For several years in early 2000s, The Rouge Forum, The Whole Schooling Consortium, and the Whole Language Umbrella of the National Council of Teachers of English held joint meetings and co-sponsored the 2000 International Education Summit for a Democratic Society.  Activism  A key principle underlying the actions of the Rouge Forum is their belief that schools and educators play a critical role in the creation of a more democratic, egalitarian society (or a society that increases in inequality and authoritarianism). The Rouge Forum is connects imperialism, war, and the regulation of schooling.Gibson, R., & Ross, E. W. (2007, February 2).

The Education Agenda is a War Agenda: Connecting Reason to Power and Power to Resistance. Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor, 16 The Rouge Forum has been active in efforts to resist curriculum standardization and high-stakes testing in schools, particularly as a result of the No Child Left Behind Act.  The Rouge Forum News  The Rouge Forum has published a newspaper/zine since 1999. The Rouge Forum News appeared twice a year in both print and online editions from 1999-2004. In 2009, The Rouge Forum News returned to a regular publication schedule as a digital zine.  Rouge Forum meetings and conferences  The Rouge Forum holds meetings on a regular basis at both local and national levels. The national conferences have been held on a more or less annual basis; all meetings are action-oriented and the national conferences usually include workshops for teachers and students; panel discussions; community-building and cultural events; as well as academic presentations. Many prominent voices for democracy and critical pedagogy have participated in Rouge Forum meetings.  Related reading  Books *Agostinone Wilson, Faith. (2013).

The church is in St Andrew's Square, near Glasgow Cross and Glasgow Green, on the edge of the City's East End. History The church, inspired by St Martin-in-the-Fields in London, was built between 1739 and 1756 by Master Mason Mungo Naismith, and designed by Allan Dreghorn. While construction of it was started before the nearby St. Andrew's-by-the-Green, it was completed after, making it either the third or fourth oldest church in Glasgow, depending on criterion. The earlier two buildings were Glasgow Cathedral and the Trongate steeple. It was the first Presbyterian church built after the Reformation, and was commissioned by the city's Tobacco Lords as a demonstration of their wealth and power. The church was enclosed by a later square, built by William Hamilton between 1786 and 1787, which became fashionable homes for some of Glasgow's wealthiest merchants. The migration of the city westwards throughout the 19th century, however, resulted in a gradual slumming of the area and a dwindling congregation. The church was last used for a religious service in June 1993. St Andrew's has played its part in Scottish history; in December 1745, before the church's completion, the Jacobite army, led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, camped around the site, and within its semi-built walls, on its return from their failed battles in England, and on 23 November 1785, huge crowds of Glaswegians gathered to watch Vincenzo Lunardi take off from the churchyard in a hot air balloon on a flight which took him south-east to Hamilton and Lanark, before eventually landing in Hawick. Agnes MClehose (n√©e Craig) married her husband James McLehose in the church in 1776. Agnes is better known as Clarinda whose love letters to Robert Burns under the name Sylvander inspired him to write 'Ae Fond Kiss' for her.

The Trust has since renovated the building, transforming it into a Centre for Traditional Scottish Music, Song and Dance. Victorian additions to the building have been removed, restoring the church's original light and airy feel, while a 4-5 metre deep excavation of the floor produced a basement cafe as well as dressing rooms, rehearsal space and toilets.

The same logo is now used by the New York Mets. The San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball originated in New York City as the New York Gothams in 1883 and were known as the New York Giants from 1885 until the team relocated to San Francisco after the 1957 season. During most of their 75 seasons in New York City, the Giants played home games at various incarnations of the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan. Numerous inductees of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York played for the New York Giants, including John McGraw, Mel Ott, Bill Terry, Willie Mays, Monte Irvin, Frankie Frisch, Ross Youngs and Travis Jackson. During the club's tenure in New York, it won five of the franchise's eight World Series wins and 17 of its 23 National League pennants. Famous moments in the Giants' New York history include the 1922 World Series, in which the Giants swept the Yankees in four games, Bobby Thomson's 1951 home run known as the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\", and the defensive feat by Willie Mays during the first game of the 1954 World Series known as \\"the Catch\\". The Giants had intense rivalries with their fellow New York teams the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers, facing the Yankees in six World Series and playing the league rival Dodgers multiple times per season. Games between any two of these three teams were known collectively as the Subway Series. The Dodgers‚ÄìGiants rivalry continues, as both teams moved to the West Coast in California after the 1957 season, with the Dodgers relocating to Los Angeles. The New York Giants of the National Football League are named after the team. Early days and the John McGraw era 1883 Gothams 1908‚Äì16, 1919‚Äì22, 1928‚Äì29 1923‚Äì27, 1930‚Äì31 The Giants began as the second baseball club founded by millionaire tobacconist John B. Day and veteran amateur baseball player Jim Mutrie. The Gothams, as the Giants were originally known, entered the National League seven years after its 1876 formation, in 1883, while their other club, the Metropolitans played in the rival American Association (1882-1891). Nearly half of the original Gothams players were members of the disbanded Troy Trojans in upstate New York, whose place in the National League the Gothams inherited. While the Metropolitans were initially the more successful club, after they won the 1884 AA championship, Day and Mutrie began moving star players to the NL Gothams, whose fortunes improved while the Metropolitans' afterwards slumped. It is said that after one particularly satisfying victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Mutrie (who was also the team's manager) stormed into the dressing room and exclaimed, \\"My big fellows! My giants!\\" From then on (1885), the club was known as the Giants. However, more recent research has suggested that the New York World was already widely using the Giants nickname throughout the 1885 season, before the legendary game was played. The team won its first National League pennant in 1888, as well as a victory over the St. Louis Browns in an early incarnation of the pre-modern-era World Series. They repeated as champions the next year with a pennant and world championship victory over Brooklyn. The Giants' original home stadium, the Polo Grounds, also dates from this early era. It had been built in 1876 as a pitch for playing polo, and was located north of Central Park adjacent to Fifth and Sixth Avenues and 110th and 112th Streets, in Harlem in upper Manhattan. After their eviction from that first incarnation of the Polo Grounds after the 1888 season, they moved further uptown to various fields which they also named the \\"Polo Grounds\\" located between 155th and 159th Streets in Harlem and Washington Heights, playing at the famous Washington Heights location at the foot of Coogan's Bluff until the end of the 1957 season, when they moved to San Francisco. The Giants were a powerhouse in the late 1880s, winning their first two National League Pennants and World Championships in 1888 and 1889. But nearly all of the Giants' stars jumped to the upstart newly-organized rival loop, the Players' League, whose New York franchise was also named the Giants, in 1890. The new team even built a stadium next door to the NL Polo Grounds. With a decimated roster, the NL Giants finished a distant sixth. Attendance took a nosedive, and the financial strain affected Day's tobacco business as well. The Players' League dissolved after the single season, and Day sold a minority interest in his NL Giants to the defunct PL Giants' principal backer, Edward Talcott. As a condition of the sale, Day had to fire Mutrie as manager. Although the Giants rebounded to third place in 1891, Day was forced to sell a controlling interest to Talcott at the end of the '91 season. Four years later, Talcott sold the Giants to Andrew Freedman, a real estate developer with ties to the Tammany Hall, the political machine of the Democratic Party that ran New York City. Freedman was one of the most detested owners in baseball history, getting into heated disputes with other owners, writers and his own players, most famously with star pitcher Amos Rusie, author of the first Giants no-hitter. When Freedman offered Rusie only $2,500 for 1896, the disgruntled hurler sat out the entire season. Attendance fell off throughout the league without Rusie, prompting the other owners to chip in $50,000 to get him to return for 1897. Freedman even hired former owner Day as manager for part of the 1899 season. In 1902, after a series of disastrous moves that left the Giants 53¬Ω games behind the front-runner, Freedman signed John McGraw as player-manager, convincing him to jump in mid-season from the Baltimore Orioles (1901-1902) of the fledgling American League and bring with him several of his teammates. McGraw went on to manage the Giants for three decades until 1932, one of the longest and most successful tenures in professional sports. Hiring \\"Mr. McGraw,\\" as his players referred to him, was one of Freedman's last significant moves as owner of the Giants, since after that 1902 season he was forced to sell his interest in the club to John T. Brush. McGraw went on to manage the Giants to nine National League pennants (in 1904, 1905, and every year from 1911 to 1914) and three World Series championships (in 1905, 1921, and 1922), with a tenth pennant and fourth world championship as Giants owner in 1933 under his handpicked player-manager successor, Bill Terry. The Giants already had their share of stars beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, such as \\"Smiling\\" Mickey Welch, Roger Connor, Tim Keefe, Jim O'Rourke, and John Montgomery Ward, the player-lawyer who formed the renegade Players' League in 1890 to protest unfair player contracts. McGraw, a veteran of the infamous 1890s Baltimore Orioles, in his three decades managing the Giants, McGraw managed star players including Christy Mathewson, \\"Iron Man\\" Joe McGinnity, Jim Thorpe, Red Ames, Casey Stengel, Art Nehf, Edd Roush, Rogers Hornsby, Bill Terry and Mel Ott. The Giants under McGraw famously snubbed their first modern World Series chance in 1904 by refusing the invitation to play the reigning world champion Boston Americans (now known as the Boston Red Sox) because McGraw considered the newly established American League of 1901, as little more than a minor league and disliked its firebrand president, Ban Johnson. He also resented his Giants' new intra-city rival New York Highlanders, who almost won the pennant but lost to Boston on the last day, and stuck by his refusal to play whoever won the 1904 AL pennant. The ensuing criticism resulted in Brush's taking the lead to formalize the rules and format of the World Series. The Giants won the 1905 World Series over Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, with Christy Mathewson nearly winning the series single-handedly with a still-standing record three complete-game shutouts and 27 consecutive scoreless innings in that one World Series. The Giants then had several frustrating years. In 1908, they finished in a tie with the Chicago Cubs due to a late-season home tie game with the Cubs resulting from the Fred Merkle baserunning \\"boner\\". They lost the postseason replay of the tie game (ordered by NL president Harry Pulliam) to the Cubs (after disgruntled Giants fans had set fire to the stands the morning of the game), who would go on to win their second (consecutive, and their last for the next 108 years) World Series. That post-season game was further darkened by a story that someone on the Giants had attempted to bribe umpire Bill Klem. This could have been a disastrous scandal for baseball, but because Klem was honest and the Giants lost the duel between Christy Mathewson and Mordecai \\"Three-Fingered\\" Brown 4‚Äì2, it faded over time. The Giants at the batting cage in 1923 The Giants experienced a mixture of success and hard luck in the early 1910s, losing three straight World Series in 1911‚Äì1913 to the A's, Red Sox and A's again (two seasons later, both the Giants and the A's, decimated by the short-lived rival third loop, the Federal League of 1914‚Äì1915, with the \\"jumping ship\\" signings of many of their stars, finished in last place). After losing the 1917 Series to the Chicago White Sox (the last World Series win for the White Sox until 2005), the Giants played in four straight World Series in the early 1920s, winning the first two over their Polo Grounds tenants, the Yankees, who had won the first two of their many pennants, led by their new young slugger Babe Ruth, then losing to the Yankees in 1923 after the original Yankee Stadium had opened that May. They also lost in 1924, when the Washington Senators won their only World Series while in D.C. 1930‚Äì1957: Five pennants in 28 seasons McGraw handed over the team to Bill Terry after the 1932 season, and Terry played for and managed the Giants for ten years, winning three pennants, defeating the Senators in the 1933 World Series but swept by the Yankees in consecutive fall classics, 1936 and 1937. Aside from Terry himself, the other stars of the era were slugger Mel Ott and southpaw hurler Carl Hubbell. Known as \\"King Carl\\" and \\"The Meal Ticket\\", Hubbell gained fame in the first two innings of the 1934 All-Star Game (played at the Polo Grounds) by striking out five future AL Hall of Famers in a row: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin. Ott succeeded Terry as manager in 1942, but the war years proved to be difficult for the Giants. Midway during the 1948 season Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher left as Dodgers skipper to manage the Giants, not without controversy. Not only was such a midseason managerial switch unprecedented, but Durocher had been accused of gambling in 1947 and subsequently suspended for that whole season by Baseball Commissioner Albert \\"Happy\\" Chandler. Durocher's ensuing eight full seasons managing the Giants proved some of the most memorable for their fans, particularly because of the arrival of five- tool superstar Willie Mays, their two pennants in 1951 and 1954, their unexpected sweep of the powerful (111-43) Cleveland Indians in the 1954 World Series and arguably the two most famous plays in Giants history. 1951: The \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" The \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World,\\" or Bobby Thomson's come-from-behind ninth-inning walk-off home run that won the National League pennant for the Giants over their bitter rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, in the deciding game of a three-game playoff series ended one of baseball's most memorable pennant races. The Giants had been 13 1/2 games behind the league-leading Dodgers in August, but under Durocher's guidance and with a 16-game winning streak, got hot and caught the Dodgers to tie for the lead on the next-to-last day of the season. Mays's catch and the 1954 Series In Game 1 of the 1954 World Series at the Polo Grounds against the Cleveland Indians, Willie Mays made \\"The Catch,\\" a dramatic over-the-shoulder catch of a fly ball by Vic Wertz after sprinting with his back to the plate on a dead run to deepest center field. At the time the game was tied 2‚Äì2 in the eighth inning, with men on first and second and nobody out. Mays caught the ball from the plate, whirled and threw the ball to the infield, keeping the lead runner, Larry Doby, from scoring. Doby advanced to third on the play, and then new pitcher Marv Grissom walked Dale Mitchell to load the bases. Grissom then struck out Dave Pope looking and got Jim Hegan to fly out to left fielder Monte Irvin to end the inning. Grissom got out of another jam in the ninth when 1953 AL MVP Al Rosen flew out to Irvin with two outs and two on. In the tenth, Grissom faced more trouble, but got Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Lemon to line out with runners on the corners and 2 outs, preserving the tie game. In the bottom of the tenth, Willie Mays drew a 1 out walk and stole second base, thus prompting Lemon to intentionally walk Hank Thompson. And with runners on first and second with one out, pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes hit a walk off home run that just squeaked over the right field wall at an estimated . The underdog Giants went on to sweep the series in four straight, despite the Indians' American League 111-43 regular season. The 1954 World Series title would be their last appearance in the World Series as the New York Giants, with the team moving to San Francisco to start the 1958 season. New York Giants of the 1950s In addition to Bobby Thomson and Willie Mays, other memorable New York Giants of the 1950s include Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher, coach Herman Franks, Hall of Fame outfielder Monte Irvin, outfielder and runner-up for the 1954 NL batting championship (won by Willie Mays) Don Mueller, Hall of Fame knuckleball relief pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm, starting pitchers Larry Jansen, Sal Maglie, Jim Hearn, Marv Grissom, Dave Koslo, Don Liddle, Max Lanier, Rub√©n G√≥mez, Al Worthington, and Johnny Antonelli, catcher Wes Westrum, catchers Ray Katt and Sal Yvars, shortstop Alvin Dark, third baseman Hank Thompson, first baseman Whitey Lockman, second basemen Davey Williams and Eddie Stanky, outfielder-pitcher Clint Hartung and utility men Johnny Mize, Bill Rigney, Daryl Spencer, Bobby Hofman, Joey Amalfitano, Tookie Gilbert, and 1954 Series hero Dusty Rhodes, among others. In the late 1950s and after the move to San Francisco two Hall of Fame first basemen, Orlando Cepeda and Willie McCovey, joined the team. 1957: Move to California The Giants' final three years in New York City were unmemorable. They stumbled to third place the year after their World Series win, and attendance fell off precipitously. While seeking a new stadium to replace the crumbling Polo Grounds, the Giants began to contemplate a move from New York, initially considering Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota, which was home to their top farm team, the Minneapolis Millers. Under the rules of the time, the Giants' ownership of the Millers gave them priority rights to a major league team in the area (the Washington Senators wound up there as the Minnesota Twins in 1961). At this time, the Giants were approached by San Francisco mayor George Christopher. Despite objections from shareholders such as Joan Whitney Payson, majority owner Horace Stoneham entered into negotiations with San Francisco officials around the same time the Dodgers' owner Walter O'Malley was courting the city of Los Angeles. O'Malley had been told that the Dodgers would not be allowed to move to Los Angeles unless a second team moved to California as well. He pushed Stoneham toward relocation, and so in the summer of 1957 both the Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers announced their moves to California, ending the three-team golden age of baseball in New York City. New York would remain a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, when Joan Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city (as part of MLB's first wave of expansion). Owners Payson and M. Donald Grant, who became the Mets' chairman, had been the only Giants board members to vote against the Giants' move to California. The \\"NY\\" script on the Giants' caps and the orange trim on their uniforms, along with the blue background used by the Dodgers, would be adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Giants orange and Dodgers blue.

Initially a moderate republican, he was later one of the first social democrats, becoming the leader, in 1902, of the French Socialist Party, which opposed Jules Guesde's revolutionary Socialist Party of France. The two parties merged in 1905 in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). An antimilitarist, Jaur√®s was assassinated at the outbreak of World War I, and remains one of the main historical figures of the French Left. Jaur√®s was an heterodox Marxist: he rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat and tried to conciliate idealism and materialism, individualism and collectivism, democracy and class struggle, patriotism and internationalism.S√©villia, Jean, Histoire Passionn√©e de la France, Perrin, 2013, p. 376 Early career The son of an unsuccessful businessman and farmer, Jean Jaur√®s was born in Castres (Tarn), into a modest French provincial haut-bourgeois family. His younger brother, Louis became an admiral and a Republican-Socialist deputy. A brilliant student, Jaur√®s was educated at the Lyc√©e Sainte-Barbe in Paris and admitted first at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, in philosophy, in 1878, ahead of Henri Bergson. He obtained his agr√©gation of philosophy in 1881, ending up third, and then taught philosophy for two years at the Albi lyc√©e before lecturing at the University of Toulouse. He was elected Republican deputy for the d√©partement of Tarn in 1885, sitting alongside the moderate Opportunist Republicans, opposed both to Georges Clemenceau's Radicals and to the Socialists. He then supported both Jules Ferry and L√©on Gambetta. Historian In 1889, after unsuccessfully contesting the Castres seat, this time under the banner of Socialism, he returned to his professional duties at Toulouse, where he took an active interest in municipal affairs and helped to found the medical faculty of the University. He also prepared two theses for his doctorate in philosophy, (\\"On the first delineations of German socialism in the writings of [Martin] Luther, [Immanuel] Kant, [Johann Gottlieb] Fichte and [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich] Hegel\\") (1891), and . Jaur√®s became a highly influential historian of the French Revolution. Research in the archives in the in Paris led him to the formulation of a theoretical marxist interpretation of the events. His book (1900‚Äì03) shaped interpretation from Albert Mathiez (1874‚Äì1932), Albert Soboul (1914‚Äì1982) and Georges Lefebvre (1874‚Äì1959) that came to dominate teaching analysis in class-conflict terms well into the 1980s. Jaur√®s emphasized the central role the middle class played in the aristocratic , as well as the emergence of the working class \\"\\" who espoused a political outlook and social philosophy that came to dominate revolutionary movements on the left.James Friguglietti and Barry Rothaus, \\"A new view of Jean Jaures' Histoire Socialiste.\\" Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750‚Äì1850: Selected Papers (1994), pp 254-261.James Friguglietti, \\"Albert Mathiez, an Historian at War.\\" French Historical Studies (1972): 570‚Äì586 in JSTOR Rise to prominence was initially a moderate republican, opposed to both 's Radicalism and socialism. He developed into a socialist during the late 1880s. In 1892 the miners of went on strike over the dismissal of their leader, . 's campaigning forced the government to intervene and require 's reinstatement. The following year, Jaur√®s was re-elected to the National Assembly as socialist deputy for Tarn, a seat he retained (apart from the four years 1898 to 1902) until his death. Defeated in the election of 1898 he spent four years without a legislative seat. His eloquent speeches nonetheless made him a force to be reckoned with as an intellectual champion of Socialism. He edited , and was, along with , one of the most energetic defenders of Alfred Dreyfus (during the Dreyfus Affair that polarized the Right and Left), army officers, and an educated newspaper readership. He approved of , and the socialist's inclusion in the cabinet, though this led to an irredeemable split with the more revolutionary section led by forming the Independent Socialists Party.See the 26 November 1900 debate between Jules Guesde and Jaur√®s . SFIO leadership Jaur√®s' , 1899 In 1902 Jaur√®s was again returned as deputy for Albi. The independent socialists merged with Paul Brousse's \\"possibilist\\" (reformist) Federation of the Socialist Workers of France and Jean Allemane's Revolutionary Socialist Workers Party to form the French Socialist Party, of which Jaur√®s became the leader. They represented a social democratic stance, opposed to Jules Guesde's revolutionary Socialist Party of France. During the Combes administration his influence secured the coherence of the Radical-Socialist coalition known as the , which enacted the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. In 1904, he founded the socialist paper . According to Geoffrey Kurtz, Jaures was \\"instrumental\\" in the reforms carried out by the administration, Emile Combes, \\"influencing the content of legislation and keeping the factions within the Bloc united.\\"Combes social reforms Following the Amsterdam Congress of the Second International, the French socialist groups held a Congress at Rouen in March 1905, which resulted in a new consolidation, with the merger of Jaur√®s's French Socialist Party and Guesde's Socialist Party of France. The new party, headed by Jaur√®s and Guesde, ceased to co-operate with the Radical groups, and became known as the (PSU, Unified Socialist Party), pledged to advance a collectivist programme. All the socialist movements unified the same year in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). On 1 May 1905 Jaur√®s visited a newly formed wine making cooperative in Maraussan. He said the peasants had to unite instead of refusing to help each other. He told them to, \\"in the vat of the Republic, prepare the wine of the Social Revolution!\\". As the revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers developed, on 11 June 1907 Jaur√®s filed a bill with Jules Guesde that proposed nationalization of the wine estates. After troops had shot wine growing demonstrators later that month, Parliament renewed its confidence in the government. Jaur√®s's carried the headline, \\"The House acquits the mass killers of the Midi\\". In the general elections of 1906, Jaur√®s was again elected for the Tarn. His ability was now generally recognized, but the strength of the SFIO still had to reckon with radical Georges Clemenceau, who was able to appeal to his countrymen (in a notable speech in the spring of 1906) to rally to a Radical programme which had no socialist ideas in view, although Clemenceau was sensitive to the conditions of the working class. Clemenceau's image as a strong and practical leader considerably diminished socialist populism. In addition to daily journalistic activity, Jaur√®s published ; (1900); (1899); (1902), and, with other collaborators, (1901), etc. In 1911 he travelled to Lisbon and Buenos Aires. He supported, albeit not without criticisms, the teaching of regional languages, such as Occitan, Basque and Breton, commonly known as \\"patois\\", thus opposing, on this issue, traditional Republican jacobinism.Jean Jaur√®s, \\"L'√©ducation populaire et les \\"patois\\"\\", in La D√©p√™che, 15 August 1911 \\"M√©thode compar√©e\\", in Revue de l'Enseignement Primaire, 15 October 1911. On- line Anti-militarism Jean Jaur√®s Jaur√®s was a committed antimilitarist who tried to use diplomatic means to prevent what became the First World War. In 1913, he opposed √âmile Driant's Three-Year Service Law, which implemented a draft period, and tried to promote understanding between France and Germany. As conflict became imminent, he tried to organise general strikes in France and Germany in order to force the governments to back down and negotiate. This proved difficult, however, as many Frenchmen sought revenge () for their country's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and the return of the lost Alsace- Lorraine territory. Then, in May 1914, with Jaur√®s intending to form an alliance with Joseph Caillaux for the labour movement, the Socialists won the General Election. They planned to take office and \\"press for a policy of European peace\\". Jaur√®s accused French President Raymond Poincar√© of being \\"more Russian than Russia\\"; whereas Ren√© Viviani complied. In July 1914, he attended the Socialist Congress in Brussels where he struck up a constructive solidarity with German socialist party leader Hugo Haase. On the 20th of that month, Jaur√®s voted against a parliamentary subsidy for Poincar√©'s visit to St. Petersburg; which he condemned as both dangerous and provocative. The Caillaux‚ÄìJaur√®s alliance was dedicated to defeating military objectives aimed toward precipitating war. France sent a mission, headed by Poincar√©, to coordinate French and Russian responses. Always a pacifist, Jaur√®s rushed back to Paris to attempt an impossible reconciliation with the government. Russia had partially mobilized, which Germany took as an extreme provocation.Luigi Albertini, Origins, III, pp. 94-95; McMeekin, p.324 Assassination On 31 July 1914, Jaur√®s was assassinated. At 9 pm, he went to dine at the Caf√© du Croissant, 146, rue Montmartre. Forty minutes later, Raoul Villain, a 29-year- old French nationalist, walked up to the restaurant window and fired two shots into Jaur√®s' back. He died five minutes later, at 9.45 pm. Jaur√®s had been due to attend an international conference on 9 August, in an attempt to dissuade the belligerent parties from going ahead with the war. Villain also intended to murder Madame Caillaux with his two engraved pistols.Berenson, The trials of Mme Caillaux, p.242 Tried after World War I and acquitted, he was later killed by Spanish Republicans in 1936. Shock waves ran through the streets of Paris. One of the government's most charismatic and compelling orators had been assassinated. His opponent, Poincar√©, sent his sympathies to his widow. Paris was on the brink of revolution: Jaur√®s had been partisan for a general strike, and had narrowly avoided sedition charges. One important consequence was that the cabinet postponed the arrest of socialist revolutionaries. Viviani reassured Britain of Belgian neutrality but \\"the gloves were off\\". Jaur√®s' murder brought matters one step closer to world war. It helped to destabilise the French government, whilst simultaneously breaking a link in the chain of international solidarity. Speaking at Jaur√®s' funeral a few days later, the CGT leader, Leon Jouhaux, declared, \\"All working men... we take the field with the determination to drive back the aggressor.\\"Albertini, Origins, III, p. 225 As if in reverence to his memory, the Socialists in the Chamber agreed to suspend all sabotage activity in support of the Union Sacr√©e. Poincar√© commented that, \\"In the memory of man, there had never been anything more beautiful in France.\\"McMeekin, p.376 On 23 November 1924, his remains were transferred to the Panth√©on.Jaures murder The memorial to his assassination still exists. Political legacy Jaur√®s and Caillaux believed, after the latter was cleared of the murder his wife had committed, that they could expose the President's secret deal with Russia. This would have led to a policy of d√©tente with Germany, preventing war and the inevitable carnage from 1915. Russia had covertly subsidized Poincar√©'s election campaign.Beatty (2012) states that \\"[T]he close January 17, 1913, vote in the Chamber... elevated Poincar√© to the presidency... Rumored at the time, Russian subsidies to the Paris press were revealed in the 1920s by L'Humanit√©, the journal of the French Communist party, the Bolsheviks having supplied the editors with the tsarist documents. By 1912, the subsidies, administered by the French finance minister, M. Klotz, totaled more than two million francs a year. For this sum, Russia got favorable publicity for its railroad loan requests, for the presidential candidacy of Raymond Poincar√©, and for his pro-Russian policies as premier and president.[footnote 76, details on p. 366] Always awkward, the Republic's alliance with tsarist autocracy became so close under Poincar√© that a Toulouse paper could plausibly ask: 'Is France Republican or Cossack?'\\" (p. 234). Foornote 76 (p. 366) states \\"For details on reptile fund, see Sidney B. Fay, The Origins of the War, vol. 1 (New York: Macmillan, 1927), 270, n. 79.

Even if Germany intentionally condemned Belgium to occupation, they had already accused Russia of starting the conflict. This theory, downplaying Germany‚Äôs aggressive moves, was not widely supported in France.Luigi Albertini, Origins, III, pp. 94-95; McMeekin, p.324 In the centenary year of his assassination, politicians from all sides of the political spectrum paid tribute to him and claimed he would have supported them. Fran√ßois Hollande declared that \\"Jaur√®s, the man of socialism, is today the man of all of France\\" whilst in 2007 Nicolas Sarkozy declared that his party was Jaur√®s' successor. In popular culture * Numerous streets and plazas in France are named for Jaur√®s, especially in the south of France, as well as in Vienna (Austria), Plovdiv (Bulgaria), Tel Aviv and Haifa (Israel), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and also in Germany. * Jaur√®s appears as a character in many period French films and TV series, sometimes as the main subject and sometimes as a supporting character. * Jacques Brel wrote a song, \\"Jaur√®s\\", and recorded it for his last album Les Marquises. In it, he wonders why Jean Jaur√®s was killed, while lamenting on the life of the working class. (This song was re- interpreted by the band Zebda in 2009 as a celebration of the 150th anniversary of Jaur√®s's birth.) * \\"Les Corons\\", a song by Pierre Bachelet, contains a reference to Jean Jaur√®s: \\"Y avait √† la mairie le jour de la kermesse, Une photo de Jean Jaur√®s\\". * Al Stewart's song \\"Trains\\" includes the lyrics, \\"on the day they buried Jean Jaur√®s, World War One broke free...\\"Trains Al Stewart. * The long poem \\"The Mystery of the Charity of Charles P√©guy\\" by Geoffrey Hill (1983) begins with (and returns to) the death of Jaur√®s. * Metro stations have been named after Jaur√®s in Paris (Jaur√®s and Boulogne - Jean Jaur√®s), Toulouse (Jean-Jaur√®s), and Lyon (Place Jean-Jaur√®s). * In the 1976 film Ma√Ætresse (\\"Mistress\\"), a character looking at a Parisian map laments, \\"There are too many avenues named after Jean Jaur√®s.\\" * Transcribed as Zhores, Jaur√®s is a Russian first name, used by people as Zhores Alferov (Alferov has a brother named Marx) and Zhores Medvedev (whose brother is Roy, from M. N. Roy). For Zhores Medvedev, this has been disputed by Michael Lerner. See the letter by Michael Lerner in the New York Review of Books, 23 March 1972. * Jaur√®s figures in Jules Romains' epic fictional work Les Hommes de Bonne Volont√©. * His assassination is depicted in Roger Martin du Gard's novel The Thibaults. * Since 1981, a video clip of Fran√ßois Mitterrand placing a rose in front of Jaur√®s' tomb at the moment the Socialists returned to power in pomp and circumstance is often played on French television. * In the play Hans im Schnakenloch (\\"Hans in the mosquito pit\\") by Ren√© Schickele, the character Cavrel represents Jaur√®s.√Åine McGillicuddy, Ren√© Schickele and Alsace: Cultural Identity Between the Borders.

Michel quotes Jaur√®s throughout the film to justify and reflect on his actions. *His political journey towards democratic socialism is depicted in the 2004 made for TV movie \\"Jaur√®s, Birth of a Giant\\" (fr), . It shows him support a general strike initiated by miners in the french city of Carmaux, against the monarchist mine owner. During the course of the film, Jaur√®s goes from being a \\"Hard left Republican\\" allied to the likes of Jules Ferry, to calling himself a socialist. The movie ends with his successful attempt to unify the 7 socialist factions of France at the time under one party, the French Section of the Workers' International.

It is a repeater station of KJMJ 580 kHz in Alexandria, Louisiana. History In Brownsville KDEI's history begins not in Port Arthur but in Brownsville, on the Mexican border, where KWWG was authorized on 1080 kHz in 1925. The next year, it moved to 1260 kHz in a time- share with KRGV, which broadcast from Weslaco. The station was owned by the Chamber of Commerce and the City of Brownsville and by the Brownsville Herald newspaper after 1930. Violent storms hit south Texas in August 1933, leaving KWWG out of commission. When the station applied for renewal of its license, it also sought to be sold to Port Arthur College, which planned to move the station to Port Arthur. The Federal Radio Commission approved the move, which also allowed KRGV to go full time in Weslaco. Two petitioners, involved in the operation of KFDM radio in Beaumont, sought to deny the move of KWWG to Port Arthur, but were refused, and KWWG left the Valley for Port Arthur with a new callsign, KPAC. In Port Arthur In 1938, KPAC moved from 1260 to 1220 kHz, only to be relocated to 1250 in 1941 as a result of NARBA reallocation. KPAC had a middle of the road radio format, switching to Top 40 music in the late 1950s. It is believed locally that blues/rock artist (and Port Arthur native) Janis Joplin frequently visited KPAC's studio during her recording career. During this period, KPAC founded a sister FM at 98.5 MHz, at first as a simulcast of KPAC in 1963, which is now Spanish-language KTJM. KPAC switched back to the previous MOR format in 1966. In 1974, Port Arthur College was absorbed by Lamar University. In 1977, KPAC-AM-FM were sold to Clear Channel Communications, which changed the callsign to KTXC in 1981 and KALO (K-Low) in 1984. K-Low carried an R&B; format which competed with Beaumont's former 1380 KJET (\\"K-Jet\\") with a similar soul music format. KTXC/KALO's studios were located at the transmitter site at 7700 Gulfway Drive in Port Arthur from the Clear Channel sale until its sale to Radio Maria Inc. in 2000. KDEI (in November 2000) along with originator KJMJ (in May 2000) and sisters KOJO and KNIR (in September 2000) were the first stations forming Radio Maria's USA network and the first to broadcast in English. KDEI can also be heard during daytime hours (at 5,000 watts) in portions of the Houston and Pasadena areas and just outside the Lake Charles, Louisiana area where KOJO at 91.1 FM can be heard outside of KDEI's signal. In September 2005, Hurricane Rita destroyed KDEI's 500-foot tower and briefly knocked the station off the air. It returned to the air under special temporary authority for over a year at 250 watts on its shorter daytime tower while an emergency fundraiser and on-air pleas were made by program director Father Duane Stenzel O.F.M. The fundraiser succeeded meeting and beating its goal, a new tower was erected and KDEI was officially back on the air at full power by the end of 2007; though the STA to the FCC stated that the station expected to be back to normal within 90 days, the 6-month request turned into a 2-year STA with extensions. Online streaming is available for listeners outside of KDEI's daytime signal and when it must power down at sunset to 1,000 watts. In addition to broadcasting full-time in English, Radio Maria USA also airs a Spanish-language program \\"Pueblo de Dios\\" (People of God), which is aired on Saturday mornings from 10:30 am until noon local time and again at 10 pm. Radio Maria also offers full-time Spanish- language programming on the FM subcarrier of KPFT in Houston and online. (see links below) Listeners outside KDEI's signal can listen online in addition to Alexa,iPhone, BlackBerry and Android mobile phone devices by downloading the appropriate app from the Radio Maria website. The KPAC callsign is now used at an FM station in San Antonio, Texas. The KALO callsign is now used at an independent religious television station in Honolulu, Hawaii.

It was established by Dmitri Borgmann in 1968 at the behest of Martin Gardner. Howard Bergerson took over as editor-in-chief for 1969, but stepped down when Greenwood Periodicals dropped the publication. A. Ross Eckler Jr., a statistician at Bell Labs, became editor until 2006, when he was succeeded by Jeremiah Farrell (Butler University). Word Ways was the first periodical devoted exclusively to word play, and has become the foremost publication in that field. Lying \\"on the midpoint of a spectrum from popular magazine to scholarly journal\\", it publishes articles on various linguistic oddities and creative use of language. This includes research into and demonstrations of anagrams, pangrams, lipograms, tautonyms, univocalics, word ladders, palindromes and unusually long words, as well as book reviews, literature surveys, investigations into questionable logological claims, puzzles and quizzes, mnemonics and a small measure of linguistically oriented fiction. Willard R. Espy discovered Word Ways in 1972, and eventually used material from several dozen articles in his Almanac of Words at Play anthologies. The first of these included complete subscription details for Word Ways, which generated so many inquiries that for decades the publishers were reluctant to change their address. In the November 2020 issue, editor Jeremiah Farrell announced that the publication of Word Ways would be suspended.

Robespierre and the French Revolution is a 2009 documentary broadcast on BBC Two in July 2009. Synopsis From Left to Right: Maximilien Robespierre, Herault de Seychelles, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, Georges Couthon, Lazare Carnot and Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois In 1794, French revolutionary Maximilien Robespierre produced the world's first defense of \\"state terror\\" - claiming that the road to virtue lay through political violence. This film combines drama, archive and documentary interviews to examine Robespierre's year in charge of the Committee of Public Safety - the powerful state machine at the heart of Revolutionary France. Contesting Robespierre's legacy are Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, who argues that terror in the cause of virtue is justifiable, and Simon Schama, who believes the road from Robespierre ran straight to the gulag and the 20th-century concentration camp. The drama, based on original sources, follows the life-and-death politics of the Committee during \\"Year Two\\" of the new Republic. It was a year which gave birth to key features of the modern age: the thought crime; the belief that calculated acts of violence can perfect humanity; the notion that the interests of \\"mankind\\" can be placed above those of \\"man\\"; the use of policemen to enforce morals; and the use of denunciation as a political tool.

It was introduced in 1996. Under its previous names, the CBC's online service first went live in 1993. The Web-based service of the CBC is one of Canada's most visited web sites. It currently contains over one million pages of information. CBC also runs the French-language website Ici.Radio- Canada.ca. History In 1993, CBC launched an experimental web service, followed by a small site supporting CBC Radio and a site supporting the CBC Halifax TV program Street Cents. By 1995, the CBC had consolidated its English radio and TV sites into a single website. Around 1996, CBC began offering 24-hour live streaming of its radio services using RealAudio. The next year, CBC launched CBC Kids and covered its first federal election online. CBC launched its news site the following year. In 2000, the CBC launched a wireless service and CBC Radio 3, an Internet-exclusive broadband magazine. Radio 3 provides streaming audio devoted to youth culture and independent music and is operated by CBC Radio. In 2001, cbc.ca finished a major redesign that modernized the news portal and earned an English Television Award. In 2005, production of the Radio 3 magazine was suspended, although the site continues in podcast format. Some of its programming still aired as a Saturday-evening show on CBC Radio Two until March 2007. Bande √† part is the French equivalent and also airs content as a weekend program on Espace Musique. Both services launched as full channels on Sirius Canada in December 2005 and are also available to U.S. Sirius subscribers. Ici.Radio- Canada.ca Radio-Canada.ca is the French Language online service run by Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada, the French counterpart of the CBC. In June 2013, CBC announced that Radio-Canada's website was to be moved to ICI.ca in October 2013, as part of wide plan to re-brand all of CBC's French-language outlets under a common brand, replacing \\"Radio-Canada\\" with \\"Ici\\" as its main public- facing brand. However, following public backlash for its decision to drop the historic Radio-Canada name, the site has maintained its current domain name, but is branded in logos as ici.radio-canada.ca, and Ici.ca redirects to the site. Content The websites include news from the CBC News website, an extensive sports section, music, science, technology and entertainment pages. CBC/Radio-Canada also offers an extensive, free archives service showcasing pivotal moments in Canadian history from the 1930s on. Over 8,000 online clips and interviews from news and information programs provide an in-depth look at Canada's past. In 2004, CBC began offering RSS feeds, and in 2005, it launched a new online arts and entertainment magazine. In 2006, CBC.ca underwent another redesign after extensive study, with improvements to standards compliance. In March 2008, the website added a comments section to most news items, allowing feedback on stories. Podcasting In 2005, CBC began podcasting some of its programs as a pilot project, including CBC Radio One's national science and technology program, Quirks and Quarks, CBC Radio 3's Canadian Music Podcast, and limited podcasting of CBLA's popular Metro Morning show. In May 2006, CBC added several more podcasts, including Dispatches, best-of editions of Outfront, As It Happens, Ideas, The Current and Definitely Not the Opera, weekly podcasts from regional radio stations and Editor's Choice, a daily showcase of notable network programming. Awards In 2003, CBC won an Online News Association award in the \\"service journalism\\" category for its coverage of the SARS epidemic. In 2004, CBC.ca was the only organization to win two awards from the Online News Association ‚Äì one in the \\"specialty journalism\\" category for Canada Votes, its coverage of the 2004 Canadian federal election, and one in the \\"service journalism\\" category for ADR Database, a project from the CBC News investigative unit. CBC.ca was also a finalist in the \\"online commentary\\" category for \\"Words: Woes and Wonder\\", a series of columns about the English language. In 2007, CBCNews.ca won the 2006 RTNDA award for best overall use of new media in Canada.RTNDA awards 2006 References External links Radio-Canada.ca *CBC/SRC Archives Category:Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Category:Canadian news websites Category:Broadcasting websites Category:Internet properties established in 1993 ","title":"CBC.ca"},{"id":"24089407","text":"Yellow Cab Pizza Co. is a pizza restaurant chain based in the Philippines.

Biography Born in Venice, Alvise Contarini entered the service of the Republic of Venice in 1618, and by 1623, he had risen to such prominence that he was elected to the Grand Council of the Republic. His diplomatic career began with a posting as ambassador to the Dutch Republic. In 1626, he was named ambassador to England and in 1629 he moved on to become ambassador to France where he succeeded in persuading King Louis XIII to enter into an alliance with Venice in order to prevent troops of the Austrian Habsburgs from occupying the Valtellina. He also played a crucial role in persuading Cardinal Richelieu that France should back Sweden's intervention in the Thirty Years' War in 1630. In 1632, he was named ambassador to the papal court, before traveling to Constantinople where he was bailo from 1636 to 1641. In 1641, Venice sent Contarini to the Congress of M√ºnster. In this capacity, he spent the next seven years attempting to negotiate the end of the Thirty Years' War, a process that ultimately ended in the Peace of Westphalia. Contarini was particularly important in this process in that he was seen as a neutral party, who had the confidence of all parties. Since the chief papal negotiator, Cardinal Fabio Chigi, refused to meet with Protestant princes, whom he considered to be heretics. Contarini served as an intermediary between the cardinal and the Protestants during the negotiations. He died in Venice in 1651. Legacy The Contarini Institute for Mediation of the FernUniversit√§t Hagen is named in Contarini's honour.

One of the world's pre-eminent development economists, Lall was also one of the founding editors of the journal Oxford Development Studies and a senior economist at the World Bank (1965‚Äì68 and 1985‚Äì87). Biography Lall was born in Patna, Bihar, India, and graduated from Patna University in 1960 with a BA in economics, receiving the Gold Medal for ranking first in the university. He then read for a degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at St. John's College, Oxford University, graduating with first class honours in 1963. Lall subsequently achieved a distinction in the MPhil in economics at Oxford in 1965. Lall is the grandson of the prominent Indian historian K.P. Jayaswal, and the brother-in-law of Cambridge economist Ajit Singh. Lall's career began working as an economist at the World Bank (1965‚Äì68). Apart from a two-year return to the bank in the mid-1980s, Oxford remained his home, where he served first as Junior, then as Senior, Research Officer at the Institute of Economics and Statistics for over 30 years; as a University Lecturer in Development Economics at Queen Elizabeth House; as a Fellow of Green College since 1982; and as Professor of Development Economics since 1999. In addition, he was course director of Development Studies at Oxford and one of the founding editors of the journal Oxford Development Studies. He was one of the most productive economists at the university, writing or co-authoring 33 books between 1975 and 2003, publishing 75 listed articles in reputable refereed professional journals, 72 chapters in books, 67 reports for international agencies or governments, and another 27 articles. He also acted as adviser or consultant to a wide spectrum of governments and international development organisations, from the World Bank, UNICEF and the OECD to the European Commission and the Commonwealth Secretariat; he served as the Principal Consultant to UNCTAD (the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) on its World Investment Report, and to UNIDO (the United Nations Industrial Development Organization) on its Industrial Development Report. Academic contributions Lall made contributions to development economics in three major areas. The first of these came early in the form of pioneering work on transfer pricing by multinational enterprises, based especially on an empirical investigation of corporations operating in the pharmaceutical industry. It showed basically how multinationals could use intra-firm pricing and accounting mechanisms to siphon out, or invisibly repatriate, profits from their overseas enterprises. This was accompanied by extensive work on the role of foreign investment and multinationals in developing economies, done in part in collaboration with one of his early mentors, Paul Streeten. Lall's fascination with India and the Indian economy led to his opening up a related, highly significant field of work - the phenomenon of Third World multinationals, and developing countries as the exporters of technology. A second interwoven strand of work was on the development of technological capability in developing countries. Technology has generally mystified economists, and in turn, and true to their profession, economic theorists have tended to mystify technology. Lall stands in a fine line of thinkers who have challenged the black-box, reductionist view of technology in economic theorising. In its place, he attempted to develop over time the notion of the construction of technological capability, whether in an enterprise, in a firm, in an industry, or in an economy. He argued that, far from just \\"picking\\" industrial winners, the East Asian tiger economies had carefully and proactively \\"created\\" winners through the generation of technological capability and the acquisition of industrial competitiveness. This feeds directly into a third group of ideas. How should the industrialist, or the policymaker, in a developing country set about generating technological capability and industrial competitiveness? Lall's empirical work carefully scrutinised the validity of the ubiquitous assertions that unrestricted flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) through multinationals would lead to effective technology transfer into the manufacturing sectors of developing economies. Lall tends seriously to question the automaticity of any such benefit transfer; he shows, however, the relevance of an active state policy vis-√†-vis the domestic manufacturing and technology sectors. The importance of the role of the state in generating a successful path of competitive industrialisation was one of the continuous threads running through his work. He did not balk at taking on positions that were unpopular among the neo- liberal unfettered-globalisation school. Very early in his career, he wrote a paper which toyed critically with the notion of dependency. Ever since then, the issue of the viability of autonomous, not autarkic, industrialisation in Third World economies was for him a latent leitmotif. From start to finish, Lall remained a passionate, but scientifically rigorous, advocate of Third World industrial development. The Sanjaya Lall Visiting Professorship in Development and Business The Sanjaya Lall Visiting Professorship at the University of Oxford, created to honour Lall's academic legacy, has established itself as one of the most prestigious visiting appointments in economics. It has been held by the following scholars: 2011: Robert Wade 2013: Dani Rodrik 2014: Paul Krugman 2015: Abhijit Banerjee 2016: Avinash Dixit 2017: Kenneth Rogoff 2018: Esther Duflo 2020: Joseph Stiglitz The Visiting Professorship, which is associated with the Social Sciences Division and Green Templeton College, was launched on 3 June 2011. The inaugural event was a panel discussion involving Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, Financial Times commentator Martin Wolf, and the first holder of the new Chair, Robert Wade of the London School of Economics. The event was opened by the Chancellor of Oxford University, Lord Chris Patten. Other speakers included Colin Mayer, Dean of the Said Business School, and Frances Stewart of Queen Elizabeth House. The panellists began by evoking the memory of Sanjaya both as a friend and a pioneering development economist. Drawing on Sanjaya's intellectual legacy, they debated how emerging economies will shape the future of the global economy and the challenges they are likely to face. Professor Sen highlighted the considerable pressures Western democracies face from powerful banking institutions, and the lessons to be learned from emerging markets with more robust regulatory systems. Mr Wolf illustrated the rapid convergence of a small number of developing countries, led by China, with advanced economies. Professor Wade discussed the problems of global economic governance, arguing for radical reform of bodies such as the IMF and the G-20. The event attracted over 800 people, the largest ever turnout in the history of the Said Business School. A large number of distinguished academics from Oxford and beyond, as well as representatives from UNIDO, the World Bank, the IMF and other international organisations, attended the event.

Doom is best known to film audiences for his role as PFC Omar Ulmer in the 2009 film, Inglourious Basterds, directed by Quentin Tarantino. Early life Omar Doom was born Omar Makhdomi (pronounced Makhdoomi) in Easton, Pennsylvania, to parents Dr. Rashid and Jawahira Makhdomi. Both his parents originate from the Kashmir region of the Indian subcontinent. His father is a physician at Easton Hospital. He was one of four siblings, including his three sisters. Doom's parents would take the family to a cultural institution or exhibit every week. For example, the family would attend an opera or play in Manhattan, New York City, or a film at a local art house theater. Doom graduated from Easton Area High School in 1994 and fronted a band called Ordeal, while attending the school. Following graduation, Doom attended Parsons The New School for Design, where he pursued a degree in painting. Career Doom returned to a music career after Parsons. He became the frontman of a two-person electronic rock band called Doomington, along with Stretch Armstrong, a successful DJ and music producer. The duo is now defunct. Doom met director Quentin Tarantino in Los Angeles in 1998 through mutual friends. They have reportedly been close friends ever since. Tarantino has been known to invite Doom over to his home for movie marathons. At one point, Tarantino held a birthday party for Doom. The party included screening of old television shows, cartoons, as well as films including Hammerhead and The Mack. Acting Tarantino encouraged Makhdomi to both pursue an acting career and adopt the shorter stage name, Omar Doom. Doom was not pursuing acting at the time. Instead, he was working as a musician and a co-running a clothing line, called Diabla, with one of his sisters, Saira. Following Tarantino's advice, Doom began studying acting. In an interview during a press junket in Berlin for Inglourious Basterds, Doom described Tarantino's encouragement, \\"Quentin told me I'd be great in movies. He really pushed me. I decided to go for it. I took his advice, and studied acting. Quentin Tarantino hired Doom for his first acting role, in a small part as Vanessa Ferlito's character's love interest, Nate, in the 2007 film Death Proof. Tarantino further cast Doom in a larger role in his next film, Inglourious Basterds. Doom did not know he was cast in the movie until Tarantino called him two weeks before shooting was scheduled to start. Doom was cast as one of the film's eight Basterds, a group of Jewish American soldiers charged with hunting down and killing Nazi soldiers in occupied France during World War II. Doom attended the Cannes Film Festival with the cast in May 2009. Music Doom released an EP under the name STRAIGHT RAZOR on Lil Death Records on August 20th, 2013. The single \\"Whiskey & Ativan\\" was accompanied by remixes by Monsieur Monsieur (Bromance Records), Thee Mike B (Play it Down Records) and Sinden (Grizzly).

Odhner in Saint Petersburg before 1900 Brunsviga Thales The Odhner Arithmometer was a very successful pinwheel calculator invented in Russia in 1873 by W. T. Odhner, a Swedish immigrant. Its industrial production officiallyTrogemann G., Nitussov A.: Computing in Russia, page 39-45, GWV-Vieweg, 2001, started in 1890 in Odhner's Saint Petersburg workshop. Even though the machine was very popular, the production only lasted thirty years until the factory was nationalised and closed down during the Russian revolution of 1917. From 1892 to the middle of the 20th century, independent companies were set up all over the world to manufacture Odhner's clones and, by the 1960s, with millions sold, it became one of the most successful type of mechanical calculator ever designed. History Original design Odhner thought of his machine in 1871 while repairing a Thomas' Arithmometer (which was the only mechanical calculator in production at the time) and decided to replace its heavy, bulky Leibniz cylinder by a lighter, smaller pinwheel disk. This is why the two machines share the same name but look completely different. Odhner developed the first version of his mechanical calculator in 1873. In 1876, he agreed to build 14 machines for Ludvig Nobel, his employer at the time, which he delivered in 1877. He patented his original machine in several countries in 1878-1879 and an improved version of it in 1890. The serial production began with this improved machine in 1890. In 1891 Odhner opened a branch of his factory in Germany. Unfortunately, he had to sell it in 1892 to Grimme, Natalis & Co. because of the difficulty of having two manufacturing facilities so far apart. Grimme, Natalis & Co. started production in Braunschweig and sold their machines under the Brunsviga brand name (Brunsviga is the Latin name of the town of BraunschweigDavid J. Shaw: The Cathedral Libraries Catalogue, The British Library and the Bibliographical Society, 1998); they became very successful on their own. After Odhner's death, in 1905, his sons Alexander and Georg and son-in-law Karl Siewert continued the production and about calculators were made until the factory was nationalized during the Russian revolution and was forced to close down in 1918. This makes the Brunsviga arithmometer, with its 1892 start, the longest- lasting Odhner type calculator in production. Desktop Mechanical Calculators in production during the 19th century Legacy Share of the AB Original-Odhner, issued in August 1918 Original- Odhner Arithmos, Type 5, Made in Sweden Towards the end of 1917, the Odhner family went back to Sweden and restarted the manufacturing of their calculator under the Original-Odhner name. In 1924, the Russian government moved the old production facility to Moscow and commercialized their calculator under the Felix Arithmometer name which went on well into the 1970s. In 1950, with millions of clones manufactured, the Odhner arithmometer was one of the most popular type of mechanical calculator ever made. The number of machines produced increased constantly until the appearance of the electronic calculators in the early 1970s. For instance, the production of one of them, the Felix arithmometer of Russia, peaked in 1969 with machines made. Odhner's arithmometer was copied, manufactured and sold by many other companies all over the world. In Germany there was Thales, Triumphator, Walther and Brunsviga. In England there was Britannic and Muldivo. In Sweden Multo and Original-Odhner. In Russia Felix and in Japan Tiger and Busicom which, incidentally, was made famous because Intel created the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, while designing one of their electronic calculators in 1970.

During its height, it was the largest cooperative of its kind in North America, with over 100,000 members, and its collapse has provoked intense discussion over how food cooperatives should be operated.Berkeley: Lessons for Co-op Leaders , by Karen Zimbelman, January‚ÄìFebruary 1992 The CCB evolved out of the Berkeley Buyers' Club, formed in the midst of the Great Depression on January 27, 1936, by a small group of families active in Upton Sinclair's EPIC and local Democratic Party clubs.For All the People: Uncovering the Hidden History of Cooperation, by John Curl (PM Press, 2009), p. 192‚Äì203. Retrieved April 28, 2010. In the beginning the co-op operated out of the basement of the parsonage of a local Methodist minister in Alameda, Roy Wilson, in cooperation with another buyers' club formed seven weeks earlier in Oakland, California. In April 1937 sixty families in the local clubs joined forces to open the CCB's first store at 2491 Shattuck Avenue (at Dwight Way). By the end of 1937 the store had moved into larger premises on University Avenue, and by 1939 the co- op had grown to 225 families, with sales of $700 a week. In 1957 it was the second largest urban cooperative in the United States, with 6,000 member families, and by 1963 there were 30,000 families enrolled and several stores in operation. During the 1960s there were a series of hotly contested elections to the co-op board, in which a politically left opposition faction represented by board member Robert Treuhaft ran its own independent slate of candidates in opposition to the \\"official\\" slate. This faction held a brief- lived majority on the board in 1969. The de facto division of the co-op board into two parties continued until the end, with many issues narrowly decided on a 5‚Äì4 vote. The co-op, which at one point was operating 12 supermarkets with $83 million in sales, began closing locations and selling off co-op property in the 1970s. The co-op's final demise in 1988 has been attributed to a number of factors, including too rapid expansion, political infighting over issues like consumer boycotts, and the board's failure to negotiate concessions from its employees' union during its decline.What Happened to the Berkeley Co-op?: A Collection of Opinions, edited by Michael Fullerton, Davis, Calif. : The Center for Cooperatives, 1992 The Berkeley Co-op purchased much of its inventory from National Cooperatives, which used the CO-OP label, commonly seen on much of the stock at the stores. Stores *1414 University Avenue (at Acton Street): Until the early 1960s, this was the only Co-op. It consisted of two buildings, one housing the grocery, the other a hardware store.

This Co-op opened in the early 1960s in a newly constructed building. Also located in the same building was the Books Unlimited bookstore and the Co-op Credit Union, which still exists but at another site. In the mid 1960s, the Co-op Hardware store moved from its previous site adjacent to the University Avenue Co-op grocery to a site kitty corner from the Shattuck Co-op grocery. This site is currently a Walgreens store. *3000 Telegraph Avenue (at Ashby Avenue): opened in the early 1960s in a building formerly owned by Sid's, also a grocery. For a time, two concessions continued operating within the store; one was a Winchell's Donuts outlet, the other a barbecue chicken vendor, \\"Chef Mandels\\".

It is the fourth novel in The Cadfael Chronicles, first published in 1981 (1981 in literature). The story occurs during The Anarchy, in the English town of Shrewsbury. It was adapted for television in 1997 by Central for ITV. The book was received positively, saying that Cadfael was \\"stylishly authentic, though not quite as darkly inventive, as his previous three [novels]\\". Another review considered that while \\"Murder abounds in these early chronicles\\", the \\"predictable plotting is amply compensated for by the author's wonderful re-creation of the period\\". Plot introduction In summer 1139, England is torn by strife between King Stephen and his cousin Empress Maud, during The Anarchy. King Stephen has the advantage now. From abroad Empress Maud is building support for a renewed attempt on the throne, with Earl Robert of Gloucester. Ranulf, Earl of Chester, is married to a daughter of Robert of Gloucester. Earl Ranulf is powerful in his own right, and has not yet chosen to stand with one or the other in this war for the crown of England. Hoping they have peace now their Castle is aligned with King Stephen, the monks of Shrewsbury Abbey prepare for the three-day annual fair in honour of their namesake saint, held on the feast of Saint Peter ad Vinculum. Plot summary ;The Eve of the Fair On 30 July 1139 at the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Geoffrey Corviser, the town provost speaks up at Chapter. He appeals unsuccessfully to Abbot Radulfus for a share of the money raised by the fair to repair the damages from the siege the prior year. Cadfael meets Hugh Beringar and his wife, Aline. Cadfael is called to translate for Rhodri, a Welsh-speaking merchant. He points out a glover, Euan of Shotwick, who is an intelligencer working for Earl Ranulf. Thomas of Bristol, a wealthy and important wine merchant arrives on his boat; he is in good odour with Robert of Gloucester. Young local men arrive to convince the visiting merchants to support the town's cause, without success. Pursuing the debate, Philip Corviser touches Thomas, who strikes him down with a staff. A riot breaks out. Philip partly recovers after the blow. He sees Thomas's niece, Emma, and is smitten on the spot. Philip and his friends flee. Thomas and Emma are endangered by rolling barrels. Ivo Corbi√®re saves Emma. Cadfael defends Philip to Hugh Beringar. Emma interrupts, searching for her missing uncle. Hugh, Cadfael and Ivo Corbi√®re search for him. Corbi√®re stumbles across his drunken archer, Turstan Fowler, leaving the search to carry him the castle for a night in jail. The search ends when a barge arrives with the naked body of Thomas of Bristol, murdered with a dagger and dumped in the river. ;During the Fair Emma stays with Aline Beringar for the fair. Abbot Radulfus charges Cadfael to investigate the death. The sheriff holds Phillip in gaol. Thomas‚Äôs boat is searched by persons unknown. Then Thomas‚Äôs stall is searched, and the strongbox is stolen. Cadfael sees a pattern of something being sought and not found. Emma places a rose in full bloom in her uncle‚Äôs coffin before it is sealed. Later, Cadfael sees one petal of that flower on the floor, revealing that Thomas‚Äôs coffin has been searched. Wealthy Corbi√®re seems to be courting Emma. Emma seeks out Euan for some gloves. Euan is found dead by Cadfael and Rhodri, his neck broken. Hugh finds a bloody dagger in Euan's hand. The theory now is that Thomas and Euan of Shotwick were partisans who had come to the fair to conduct secret business, involving an item of great value. A third man kills both of them and searches in vain for the item. Brother Mark treats a man for a knife wound to the arm, a groom to Corbi√®re. Cadfael, Hugh, Sheriff Prestcote and Corbi√®re confront Ewald, who shows his neatly bandaged arm. When asked to show his cotte, he jumps on Corbi√®re's horse to escape. Corbi√®re orders Turstan to loose an arrow at Ewald, who is killed. Philip, released from jail, traces his path after he got drunk. At Wat's Tavern, Wat tells him that Turstan came twice to the tavern, first to look at the patrons, including Philip. On second visit, Turstan purchased a large bottle of hard liquor to carry away. He was sober and well dressed when he left the tavern. This is not what Turstan testified, nor how he appeared, at the hearing. Soon, Philip finds the scene of Thomas's murder. ;After the Fair Very early, Cadfael, Hugh and Philip visit the scene of Thomas's murder at the riverbank. Cadfael suggests that Turstan followed Philip. Once he ensured that Philip had no alibi, Turstan murdered Thomas. The liquor created the image he was drunk. At the guest house, Corbi√®re offers to bring Emma to her home in Bristol, stopping at his home first. Emma accepts. Cadfael realises that Corbi√®re ordered the actions of Ewald and Turstan. When Corbi√®re learned that Turstan failed, he sent Ewald to search Thomas's boat during the hearing. That same night Ewald and Turstan broke into Thomas's booth, again finding nothing. The next night they tried Euan's booth, killing him when he defended himself. Cadfael and Hugh work out Corbi√®re's scheme to save himself by fooling Ewald and ordering Turstan to kill him. They both believe Emma is safe with Aline, but Philip knows that Corbi√®re has been visiting Emma. Philip rushes to protect her, riding a merchant's horse to give chase. Aline updates Cadfael and Hugh at the Abbey; Emma and Corbi√®re left three hours earlier and Philip is gone. At Stanton Cobbold manor, Corbi√®re locks Emma in a room while he searches her baggage. Corbi√®re returns to demand the letter Thomas meant to deliver to Euan of Shotwick. Emma keeps the brazier between them. Corbi√®re tells her the letter is from Robert of Gloucester to Earl Ranulf, urging him to support the Empress's cause and naming fifty nobles in Stephen's camp who secretly support her. Corbi√®re will demand an earldom of the King for it. Emma removes the letter from her hair, unseen by Corbi√®re, and then pushes it into the fire at the expense of burning her hand. Her uncle told her only that if not delivered it must be destroyed. She knocks over the unstable brazier, setting fire to the tapestries. Emma cannot escape the locked door. She lowers herself to the floor, slowly losing consciousness. Philip rescues Emma. Hugh and Cadfael arrive. Cadfael tends to Philip's and Emma's injuries. Hugh arrests Turstan, unwary and unaware any knew his role in the murders. Corbi√®re is killed by the fire, unmourned. Philip takes Emma to his parents‚Äô home in Shrewsbury. Emma sees the value of Philip, the opposite of the brutal Corbi√®re, and a tradesperson like her. Tending Emma's burns, Cadfael says that if she has scars from these burns, she should \\"wear them like jewels\\". Radulfus summons the town provost, Philip's father, to chapter at the Abbey. Now he donates ten percent of returns from the fair to the rebuilding of the town. The novel ends with the news that on 30 September 1139, Empress Maud invaded England, establishing herself at Arundel Castle in West Sussex. Earl Ranulf of Chester did nothing to aid her cause. Characters *Brother Cadfael: At the time of Saint Peter's Fair he is 59 years old and 16 years a monk. He is Welsh, speaking both his native language and English, born near Trefriw in Gwynedd. *Brother Mark: Young assistant to Brother Cadfael in herbarium. This is his first annual fair, as none happened in the rough summer of 1138. Recently he took his final vows, giving up the world at 18, and is sure he wants to be a priest. He is short due to short commons while living with an uncle, a hard master who pushed him to the Abbey at age 16. He was introduced in Monk's Hood. *Abbot Radulfus: Head of the abbey, a real historical person in this otherwise fictional tale, just half a year in office, he is learning the townspeople. He is described as tall with silver hair and somewhat authoritarian in his manner. He is a shrewd man, knowing his duty to the Abbey and the secular law. His preferment as Abbot he owes both to the church and to the King. *Sheriff Prestcote: Sheriff of Shropshire. He was appointed Sheriff by King Stephen and was introduced in One Corpse Too Many. *Hugh Beringar: Deputy Sheriff of Shrophsire, second to Sheriff Prestcote. He became Deputy in One Corpse Too Many in 1138. He holds manors at Maesbury in Shropshire. About 24 years old, he married Aline Siward a year earlier. He is an effective man of law and justice who respects Brother Cadfael, and in some ways thinks like him. He makes some shrewd judgments but sees he was fooled by the demeanor of Corbi√®re, adding to his store of knowledge of the evil of men. Beringar, like his Sheriff, holds with King Stephen. *Aline Beringar: Cherished newlywed wife of Hugh, in early stage of first pregnancy. She is a beautiful woman with hair of gold, who brought two manors to their marriage. She and Hugh stay in the Abbey guest house so she can purchase items needed for the expected baby. She is about 20 years old and was introduced in One Corpse Too Many. *Rhodri ap Huw: Cheerful Welsh merchant of wool, honey, mead, and other goods who requests a translator of the Abbey. Radulfus sends Cadfael to serve that role. He shares much in Welsh with Cadfael on other vendors at the fair, at every point in the story. By the end, Cadfael knows Rhodri speaks many languages; asking the Abbey for a translator allows him to eavesdrop more effectively for the benefit of Owain Gwynedd, the Welsh prince. He observed that \\"Nowhere is so solitary as in the middle of a marketplace.\\" Rhodri will tell Owain that Ranulf will be fully occupied with Chester, so direct his own raids in other directions. He is from Mold on the River Alyn, in northeast Wales, east of Cadfael's birthplace, and is about 50. *Thomas of Bristol: A large gentleman with a red face and bushy eyebrows, fashionably dressed. He is a wealthy and powerful importer of wine and luxury sweets from the East via the port of Bristol in the West Country, linked to Robert of Gloucester. Three men sail with him: young Gregory, porter Warin, and journeyman Roger Dod. He is the first murder victim. *Emma Vernold: Niece of Thomas of Bristol, 18 or 19 years old, attractive with blue-black hair and blue eyes. This is her third journey with her uncle as he travels to buy and sell his goods. Her late father was a stonemason married to the sister of Thomas, also deceased. She was raised in Thomas's household since age 8. She is heiress both to her father and to her uncle, accustomed to the wealth of a tradesman family (in contrast to landed wealth). She has presence of mind in her time of great loss and change. *Euan of Shotwick: A master glove maker and important man in the court of Earl Ranulf, for whom he is an \\"intelligencer\\". He is the second man murdered in this story. Euan is described as a \\"meagre fellow\\" who trusts no one, is well dressed and clean shaven with a \\"mincing walk\\". *Philip Corviser: Son of the respected town provost and skilled boot maker Geoffrey Corviser. He is a young hothead. Their last name indicates their trade of making shoes from leather. Physically he is \\"a gangling lad, not yet in command of his long limbs, being barely twenty and only just at the end of his growing\\". He has \\"a thick thatch of reddish dark hair and a decent, homely face\\". *Edwy Bellecote: Son of Martin Bellecote, master carpenter. He was of the party of young men seeking support of the traders at the fair. He is not yet 16, so Hugh sent him home to his father rather than jailing him. Both were introduced in Monk's Hood. *Ivo Corbi√®re: A wealthy and handsome lordling of 28 or 29 with dark gold hair and slender build. He owns multiple manors. He is distant kin to Ranulf of Chester. He attends the fair to furnish a manor in Cheshire, where most of his holdings lie. His one manor in Shropshire is Stanton Cobbold. He stays at the Abbey as a guest. He is a man of fine manners, almost silky. At the end, he tells Emma she is a \\"little shopkeeper's girl of no account.\\" *Ewald: Stocky, bearded man, a villein groom in Ivo Corbi√®re's service. He is one of three murdered in this book, for what he might have said about his master. Directed to search several places by Corbi√®re, he stole portable items of value for himself. *Arald: Young groom in Ivo Corbi√®re's service. *Turstan Fowler: Falconer and archer in Ivo Corbi√®re's retinue, in his mid 30s. One of his weapons is an arbalest, with which he is very accurate. He is a man with no aversion to killing outside the context of battle; \\"like master like man\\". Major themes Saint Peter's Fair is a historical mystery set in 1139 during The Anarchy, a nineteen-year period in English history. Its themes are intrigue and espionage in a medieval setting. Literary significance and reception The 2000 reprint of Saint Peter's Fair quotes a Sunday Times review: \\"A more attractive and prepossessing detective would be hard to find\\" Kirkus Reviews finds this novel authentic but not as clever as the first three. \\"Brother Cadfael returns in another 12th-century mystery‚Äîas stylishly authentic, though not quite as darkly inventive, as his previous three.\\" They noted the \\"colorful, convincing details on the workings of a medieval fair\\" and concluded it was \\"a graceful and informative, if not particularly mysterious, case for Peters' engaging, herb-gardening monk.\\" Publishers Weekly reviewed a 1991 audio book of this and the next novel in the series in one article, liking the historical setting more than the plots. They felt that readers \\"are likely to solve these mysteries long before the insightful Benedictine monk, but predictable plotting is amply compensated for by the author's wonderful re-creation of the period\\". They commended the narration by actor Stephen Thorne.Sister M. Anna Falbo CSSF, Villa Maria College Library, Buffalo, New York, 15 December 1991, Publishers Weekly, accessed via EBSCO 30 September 2012 Setting in History The novel is set in the real town of Shrewsbury in Shropshire, England. The body of the first murder victim is found in the Severn river near Atcham. The first two victims are merchants with goods to sell, who hold similar political views, favouring the Empress. The fair at the Abbey was meant to be a neutral meeting place to get a message from Gloucester north to Chester in the efforts to gain support from a powerful man; the places are about 120 miles apart on modern roads. Thomas of Bristol came by river, passing Gloucester, while Euan of Shotwick came by land to the fair. As Cadfael noted in a conversation with Rhodri ap Huw, Rhodri's home in Mold in Wales is very close to Chester, and to Shotwick, teasing him that he might be an intelligencer for Ranulf, instead of Owain Gwynedd (prince of Gwynedd principality). The story takes place in the year 1139, during The Anarchy, a term referring to the 19-year civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud. The novel begins during a period of relative quiet in England, with Stephen crowned King since 1135. His cousin, the surviving legitimate child of the prior King Henry, Empress Maud is in Anjou attempting to build support for her invasion, aided in England by her half-brother Robert of Gloucester. The contention arose from Henry's effort to gain support from the nobility to honour his daughter as Queen on his death, as his only legitimate son had died in an accident on the White Ship in 1120. When Henry died, Stephen acted quickly to gain the crown while Maud stayed in Anjou with her husband and children. Many who had taken the oath with the dead king Henry readily gave their allegiance to Stephen. Others felt that first oath to bind them. Precisely why this split endured is never clear and continually analysed. Perhaps England was not ready for a queen; perhaps her second marriage with Geoffrey of Anjou (arranged by her father) rankled; perhaps the affable Stephen was more popular and Maud too strident; perhaps the barons wanted to be more certain of their own lands; perhaps other reasons set off the long period of strife, which was not settled until King Stephen died. The novel concludes with Empress Maud invading England on 30 September 1139 and taking Arundel Castle in West Sussex. Abbott Radulfus was the real Abbott at this Benedictine monastery, who began in 1138 as the replacement of Abbott Heribert. In historical records he is sometimes called Ranulf. The Saint Peter's Fair was allowed to the Abbey as a way for it to earn revenue. The three-day fair was granted either by Earl Roger or King Henry I. The Lammas Fair was allowed in the same fashion, originally on 1 August, become 12 August after the change of the calendar in 1752. The Charter fair was a primary method of buying and selling trade goods in this century (the 12th) as part of the growing economy, as well as a benefit to the Abbey, from rents, fees, tolls.

As a surgeon in the United States Naval Reserve, he received the Medal of Honor for his actions during World War I. Early life and family Petty was born in Cadiz, Ohio on February 20, 1874. To Asbury Festus Petty and Sallie M Kyle. Orlando had a twin brother Orville A Petty and a younger sister Netta A Petty. He graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1904 and two years later joined the school's teaching staff. In 1908, he married Marcia P. Mellersh of Philadelphia; the couple had two children, Clara M. and Orville A. Petty. Military service Petty joined the U.S. Naval Reserve Force as a lieutenant, junior grade, in December 1916 and served in the Medical Corps. After the United States' entry into World War I, he was sent to France where he worked as an assistant surgeon. In March 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant. By June 11, 1918, Petty was attached to the 5th Marine Regiment as the unit took part in the Battle of Belleau Wood. On that day, his dressing station in Lucy-le-Bocage came under heavy fire from German artillery, some of which were firing poison gas shells. He continued to evacuate and treat the wounded, even after he was knocked to the ground and his gas mask rendered useless by an exploding shell. When the dressing station was destroyed, he personally carried wounded Captain Lloyd W. Williams to safety. Captain Williams was the Marine famously quoted as saying \\"Retreat? Hell, we just got here!\\" For these actions, Petty was awarded the Medal of Honor. Other decorations which Petty received during the war include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Croix de Guerre with palm from France, and the Croce di Guerra from Italy. Later years and death After his military service, Petty returned to Philadelphia and resumed teaching medicine. From 1923 until shortly before his death, he was a professor of metabolic diseases at the University of Pennsylvania. He was also the personal physician of Philadelphia mayor Harry A. Mackey. In 1931, Mackey appointed him as the head of the city's public health department. Petty was a member of the Sons of the Revolution. On June 2, 1932, Petty's family found him dead in the bedroom of his Philadelphia home. He had been shot through the heart, apparently with his military service pistol, which was found nearby. His family noted that he had been in poor health for some time; his death was ruled a suicide. He is buried at Saint Timothy's Episcopal Church Cemetery in Philadelphia's Roxborough neighborhood. Obituary The Philadelphia Inquirer: Date: 6-3-1932, Pg.1 and 10: DR O H PETTY ENDS OWN LIFE EX-HEALTH HEAD - Director During Last Months of Mackey Regime Kills Self With Pistol - Found Dead at Home at 1803 Pine, Was World War Hero, One-time President of Medical Society: Dr Orlando H Petty former Director of the Public Health in the closing period of the Mackey administration, widely known physician and World War hero, hot and killed himself with a German Luger pistol, a war trophy, in a bedroom of his home at 1803 Pine St, shortly before six o'clock last night. He was 57 years of age. Dr Petty and Dr Joel T Boone, personal physician to President Hoover, were the only physicians to be decorated with the Congressional Metal of Honor for heroic service during the World War. In additional to the Congressional decoration Dr Petty received other metals in recognition of his valor while under fire in a front-line dressing station during heavy fighting in June 1918. The physician apparently entered his bedroom shortly after 5 P.M. yesterday. At about 5:45 P.M. he pressed the heavy Luger against his breast and pulled the trigger. A bullet ripped through his heart, killing him instantly. SECRETARY FINDS BODY The report was heard by Dr Petty's secretary, Miss Rose Cullen, of 608 Wynnewood Rd, Overbrook. She rushed to the bedroom to find the man dead. After notifying members of the family of the tragedy the young woman summoned the police and the coroner. The body of Dr Petty was removed to Graduate Hospital for official verification of death. The remains were then removed to the morgue. Detectives who talked to members of the family said that they were given to understand that Dr Petty had been in ill health. Despondency over his condition was the only motive the family could advance as a possible motive for his self-destruction. In April 1931, Dr Petty was confined to Mt Sinai Hospital suffering from a complaint the nature of which was unrevealed. Last September Dr Petty was appointed Director of the Department of Public Health to fill the vacancy created by the Dr A A Cairns. He also was person physician to Mayor Mackey and accompanied the latter on his European trip. GRADUATE OF JEFFERSON Dr Petty was graduated from Franklin College, New Athens, Ohio in 1900, and from Jefferson Medical College in 1904 and served as an intern in St Timothy's Hospital. He was an associate surgeon with Dr John B Lowman, of Johnstown, for one year and then returned here and was connected with the teaching staff of Jefferson Medical College until 1923. From 1923 until recently, Dr Petty was professor of disease of metabolism in the Graduate School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania. He served under the late Dr Cairns as a medical inspector of the Board of Health of 1908 until after the World War. In 1924 he wrote a book on \\"Diabetes and Its Treatment by Insulin and Diet.\\" It recently reached its fifth edition. He also was author of many articles on scientific matters. He was the author of an important work on \\"Prevention of Communicable Respiratory Disease Based on Observations in Army Camps.\\" He introduced insulin here after its discovery at the University of Toronto. Dr Petty maintained offices at his home on Pine St. He shared his office with Drs Charles J Haines and John A Murphy. He was a member of the Philadelphia County Medical Society, The Pennsylvania State Medical Society, a Fellow of the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and numerous other medical societies. SERVED WITH MARINES On April 2, 1917, Dr Petty was assigned as captain to active duty as a surgeon of the United States Marine Corps. He sailed for France in August, 1917 and served with the Fifth Marines, Second Division. For \\"valor in battle against an armed enemy of the United States\\" Dr Petty received the following decorations: The Congressional Metal of Honor, the United States Distinguished Service Cross, French Croix de Guerre with palm and the Italian War Cross. Dr Petty and Joel T Boone, personal physician to President Hoover, are the only physicians serving in the World War who received the Congressional Metal of Honor. The act of heroism for which Dr Petty was honored occurred on June 11, 1918, while in fierce action with the Marines. Under heavy shell fire he worked in his frontline dressing station until the building literally fell in flames over him. He then managed to escape to a place of safety, carrying a wounded officer on his back. FORMER MEDICAL SOCIETY HEAD He was severally gassed and was in a hospital for many days. he finally insisted upon being released from the hospital and immediately returned to front-line duty. He served as physician to the Memorial Hospital, Roxborough, pathologist in that institution and also as pathologist to the Germantown Hospital. He was a past president of the Philadelphia County Medical Society and of the Medical Club of Philadelphia; a past national commander of the Army and Navy Legion of Valor and past commander of the Thomas Roberts Reath Post, No 186, American Legion. In 1924 he was appointed physician in charge of the Department of Metabolism of the Philadelphia Hospital. In addition to being a member of several leading physicians' organizations he belonged to the Pennsylvania Society, Sons of the Revolution, Aesculapian and Manufacturers Clubs. He also belonged to the University Club, Ocean City Golf Club and Lu Lu Temple Country Club. He was an Episcopalian by faith and a 32nd Degree Mason. Dr Petty was born in Cadiz, O. In 1908 he married Miss Marcia P Mellersh of this city. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Miss Clara M Petty, and a son Orville A Petty, 2nd.

He studied in Zurich, Switzerland at the Eidgen√∂ssiche Technische Hochschule, receiving his diploma in 1947 and a D.Sc. in 1951. His dissertation was titled \\"On complex analytic manifolds with Kahler metric\\". It was published in Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici:25:257‚Äì97 (in German). Guggenheimer began his teaching career at Hebrew University as lecturer 1954‚Äì6. He was a professor at Bar Ilan University 1956‚Äì9. In 1959 he immigrated to the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1965. Washington State University was his first American post, where he was an associate professor. After one year he moved to University of Minnesota where he was raised to a full professor in 1962. While in Minnesota he wrote Differential Geometry (1963), a textbook treating \\"classical problems with modern methods\\".

It was laid down at Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina. The ship was commissioned on 21 November 1944 under Lieutenant Junior Grade John W. Loyer, of the US Navy Reserve, in command. LSM(R)-191 took part in the assault and occupation of Okinawa on 26 March-3 June 1945. Service history  During World War II the ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater. At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the but were promptly destroyed. On 1 April 1945 the southern half of the six-mile-wide Okinawa invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 55, commanded by Rear Admiral John Leslie Hall, Jr. with the assault troops under Major General John R. Hodge. The southern support craft included LSM(R)s 189, , USS LSM(R)-191, , and . The northern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. The LSMR's involved in the invasion as part of the Northern Tractor Flotilla included , , , , , and . The American defense plan against kamikaze attack was for fighters to intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning in all directions. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers down to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters to intercept before the Japanese could attack the fleet off Okinawa or the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. However some aircraft chose to attack the picket vessels. Dennis L. Francis who was LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 2 ‚Äì 20 April, in his Action Report said of the LSMs \\"these ships are not particularly suited for picket duty...They have no great value in combating enemy air craft due to the absence of air search radar, adequate director control for the 5\\"/38 main battery, and director control for the 40mm single guns\\" He added that since their magazines held explosive rockets added to the hazard. He advised against putting them on the picket line when other vessels were available since there was a risk of losing these specialist vessels. Before these recommendations were implemented LSM(R)-195 was sunk on 3 May 1945 with 9 killed and 16 wounded, LSM(R)-190 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 18 wounded, and LSM(R)-194 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 23 wounded.

It was released in the U.K. by Mirrorsoft in 1989 and in the U.S. by SSI in 1990.  Overview  The player takes the role of either Wellington or Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. The battle may be played with the historical orders or custom orders. It is a turn-based strategy game. The 100-page manual provides historical and military background to the battle as well as gameplay information. A fold-out map of the battlefield and initial dispositions of units is also provided.  Gameplay  The game was innovative in being played from the point of view of the commander, with the battlefield rendered in simple three-dimensional perspective rather than the overhead view traditionally typical of battlefield strategy games. This means that the player's knowledge of the progress of the battle is limited to what he can see with his own eyes and the reports of subordinates. The player may move around the battlefield to better observe events, but risks death or capture if he approaches too close to the front. The player is not permitted to micromanage the movements of individual units, as these are not under his direct command; instead he must give orders to subordinate commanders who interpret them according to their own judgement. A subordinate commander will ignore an order he considers unfeasible. Orders are issued using natural language commands reminiscent of adventure games. For example, *\\"D'Erlon, at 1 15 pm order Donzelot defend the hills 1 mile south of you\\" *\\"Lobau, transfer your cavalry to Reille\\" *\\"Drouot, at 6 30 pm give support to Reille, D'Erlon and Milhaud\\"Game manual. Orders take time to arrive at their destinations, as do combat reports sent by subordinates to the player. Messengers may also be killed or captured. This means that units remote from the commander may not receive orders in time, while units engaged in combat may not receive them at all. The game begins at 11:30 am and ends at 9:30 pm, when the results are assessed. The computer then decides if the player has been defeated, is victorious, or if the result is inconclusive. Reception In the August 1989 edition of Games International (Issue #8), Mike Woodhouse called this \\"a marvellous simulation of a battle which was a pivotal point in history, and I am impressed with the quality of programming.\\" He pointed out that the ground- level perspective, and the delay from issuing orders to having them executed \\"make for a game rather different to the usual computer wargame.\\" He found the interface \\"a real pain\\" because the program did not highlight developments that occurred in each new segment of play, leaving the player to try to figure out what had developed. He also found that on slower machines, completing a game could take more than five hours. He concluded by giving the game play an average rating of 3 out of 5, and the graphics a below average score of only 2 out of 5. He recommended the game especially to students of military history, but warned board wargamers more used to conventional wargames \\"that you try Waterloo before splashing out on it.\\" In the July‚ÄìAugust 1990 edition of Computer Gaming World (Issue 73), M. Evan Brooks, who had studied the Battle of Waterloo at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, admired the documentation, the background and history provided, and the method of issuing orders, although he pointed out certain ambiguities in attack and defense orders and their subsequent effects. He thought that the unusual, three-dimensional ground perspective was a radical departure from the usual bird's eye view usually employed, and the resulting uncertainty over the battle's progress helped make the game the most accurate of the ten simulations of the battle he had played. He found the graphics to be \\"very good\\", and although he found commanders and dispatch riders \\"displayed somewhat like Gumby\\" he still found the overall impression to be impressive. However, Brooks found that constant map redrawing, while it was not a problem on a fast computer, \\"does become burdensome on slower machines\\" and he also criticized the lack of audio. He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 3 out of 5, saying, \\"Waterloo is a radical departure from most wargaming. Its ground perspective and issuance of orders places the player in the role of the battlefield commander ‚Äî with the disadvantages inherent in such position. The simulation will rapidly teach the user why commanders have difficulty in achieving battlefield success and why we compensate generals so well.\\" Two issues later, in the October 1990 edition of Computer Gaming World ((Issue 75), Brooks summarized his previous review as: \\"Much more of a wargame than the historic staff simulations more commonly produced, it is a fascinating, albeit frustrating, game.\\" References  External links   Waterloo at Lemon Amiga * Waterloo at The Little Green Desktop Category:1989 video games Category:Napoleonic Wars video games Category:Acorn Archimedes games Category:Amiga games Category:DOS games Category:Atari ST games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Computer wargames Category:Personal Software Services games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Works about the Battle of Waterloo Category:Cultural depictions of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington ","title":"Waterloo (video game)"},{"id":"24089887","text":"Finbar Furey (born 28 September 1946), is a multi-instrumental Irish folk musician, best known for his band of brothers, The Fureys who were formed in Ballyfermot, Dublin, where they grew up. Early life Finbar Furey was born on 28 September 1946 in Ballyfermot, Dublin, Ireland. Finbar's well-known musician father, Ted started him on the Uilleann pipes while he was very young. By his teens, he had won three All Ireland Medals, The Oireachtas, and many Feisanna. He was the only piper to win the All Ireland, the Oireachtas medal and the four province titles in the same year. Finbar is an Irish Traveller. Career Finbar popularized the pipes worldwide while on tour with his brother Eddie in the 1960s. In 1969, Finbar and Eddie began touring as backup musicians for the influential Irish folk group, The Clancy Brothers. Finbar played the pipes, as well as the banjo, tin whistle, and guitar with the group live, on television, and on recordings. The Furey brothers left the group the following year and began performing as a duo again. Finbar and Eddie were awarded Single of the Year by John Peel in 1972. When the younger brothers Paul and George joined the band, several years later, The Fureys enjoyed hits including When You Were Sweet Sixteen, Tara Hill, Green Fields of France, Red Rose Caf√© and The Lonesome Boatman. In Britain, they became one of the first Irish folk groups to play on Top of the Pops. In 1997, after nearly thirty years as The Fureys' front man, Finbar decided the time was right to follow his own path as a singer songwriter. He decided to step aside and pursue his solo career, to present his definitive one-man show and to explore new pastures as a singer, producer and writer. In the early 2000s, Finbar began an acting career. His first appearance was in the Martin Scorsese film Gangs of New York. He has also appeared in 2004's Adam & Paul, 2007's Strength and Honour, 2010s short Paris Sexy, and the RT√â Television series 'Love/Hate. In 2011 he released the album Colours on Dolphin Music. The album featuring guest performances from Mary Black and Shayne Ward was released in North America in 2012 on the Valley Entertainment record label. In August 2013, Furey appeared on the Irish television show The Hit. He recorded a single pitched by a songwriter, Gerry Fleming. The single, \\"The Last Great Love Song\\", charted at number one in the Irish charts against Mundy's song \\"Jigsaw Man\\" written by Mark Walsh which charted at number five. The song was performed again with the RT√â Concert Orchestra in the final and came first place in the public vote earning the title \\"The Ultimate Hit\\".

The film is the sequel to the 2006 comedy National Lampoon's Dorm Daze 2: College @ Sea. The film did poorly at the box office, making it one of the biggest flops of 2009. Synopsis 16th century Romania is terrorized by vampire king Radu, and his lover the evil sorceress Stephenia. Vampire hunter Victor Van Sloan tricks Stephenia into opening an enchanted music box, which sucks in her soul. Escaping out a window into daylight, Van Sloan falls to his death thanks to his moronic son's accidentally moving the hay cart which had been positioned to soften his landing. The music box is washed away in the river, leading Radu to begin a centuries-long search for it. In the present, several American college students are convinced by their friend Rusty (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Radu) to spend a semester in Romania at Razvan University, which was formerly Radu's castle; his true reason is to meet his computer girlfriend Draguta. At the university, they meet the diminutive dean Floca and self-defense teacher Teodora, Van Sloan's descendant who has been tasked with preventing Radu from getting the music box. Radu returns to the castle that night, and begins collecting blood as part of a ceremony to revive Stephenia. Unfortunately, a truly dumb blond now owns the music box and accidentally lets her blood fall on the gem inside it; as a result, Stephenia can now take possession of her body when the music box is open. Rusty learns that Draguta is the dean's hunchback daughter; he is forced into a relationship with Draguta by Floca after finding her previous boyfriend locked in a torture room for simply standing her up. The other students discover that Floca kidnapped girls from the university for experiments to remove their heads for a body swap, to give Draguta a normal body. They take the still-living head of their friend just as Floca returns with Draguta for the procedure. At the same time, Teodora has mistaken Rusty for Radu, due to the costume he chose for a vampire-themed party that he missed due to accidentally being given drugs that made him woozy. Rusty is accidentally taken by Radu's minions to enact the ritual to revive Stephenia; however, as this would require ripping out the heart of her host, Rusty is forced to shut the music box and listen to his friend's idiotic ramblings of how she thinks aliens are controlling her. Assaulted by her boyfriend, Rusty gives up on trying to help as his friends are too stupid to listen. Rusty spots Radu, and pretends to be a reflection through a frame used for pictures to buy time to hide; Teodora ends up finding the wrong one, but is forced to eliminate Radu's minions. Rusty attempts hiding in the dance hall, but is confronted by Teodora; he attempts reasoning, but she is too stubborn to believe \\"vampire lies\\". The real Radu arrives along with Stephenia, causing a stressful back and forth. With Rusty and Radu side- by-side, Teodora and Stephenia realize they were both wrong. Unfortunately, campus security men arrest Teodora, leaving Radu's execution to Cliff, a moron who's been attempting to pick up chicks by pretending to be a vampire hunter, who can't tell the two apart despite the obvious difference in their voices. The crossbow fires accidentally, hitting Radu in the heart and reducing him to ash; Teodora smashes the music box, which causes Stephenia's corpse to dissolve, and free her host. A time skip reveals Cliff became a Razvan professor, printing a fabrication about how Radu was defeated. He also explains the fates of his friends, while some have great careers, other are not so fortunate. In the case of Rusty, though he is now married to the attractive Draguta, their child is highly deformed despite her different body (it has dean Floca's pointed hair, goatee, and Draguta's hump). Dean Floca was also arrested for his crimes. As for Teodora, she moved to America as there was no longer anything to hunt in Romania; she became a cop, but has trouble telling deformed people apart from actual monsters. Cast Release The film premiered at American Film Market in November 2008, and was screened at the European Film Market in February 2009.

The DVD was released on April 27, 2010 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

Review aggregator Metacritic scored the film 8 out of 100 based on 10 reviews, indicating \\"Overwhelming dislike.\\" Tom Russo for The Boston Globe called it \\"woefully dim-witted.\\" Steven Hyden for The A.V. Club called it \\"such a colossal comedic misfire that it makes the execrable Scary Movie films look like masterworks of Preston Sturges-esque genius by comparison.\\" Frank Scheck for The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"lame vampire spoof\\" that \\"has no bite.\\" Adam Markovitz for Entertainment Weekly called it \\"a no-stars, no-plot, no-point vampire spoof about a group of coeds studying abroad in a haunted castle, Transylmania boasts the kind of acting and direction usually relegated to the adult section of your local video store.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote that Transylmania is \\"destined to spend a short and painful life in theaters and then join the ranks of the DVD and late-night-cable undead.\\" Robert Able of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"if your idea of a good time is laughing with repulsion at a humpbacked Romanian nympho with a torture-loving midget dad, or tittering every time a bong appears, a darkened theater awaits you.\\" Brian Orndorf said that \\"I surveyed the crowd at the screening I attended, feeling the chill in the air as seven strangers sat in stone-cold silence -- not a single laugh from anyone. The eighth moviegoer? Fast asleep five minutes in. I've never envied a person more.\\" Box office The film was a major box office disaster and had an extremely poor opening, at #21 with only $263,941 from 1,007 theaters, making it the 3rd worst movie opening since 1982 for films which opened in more than 600 theaters, and the worst ever at the time for films opening in over 1,000 theaters. 2012 lawsuit David and Scott Hillenbrand were sued by their Transylmania financial backers for financial recovery in 2012. Kim Swartz, an attorney at Mitchell Silberberg representing the Hillenbrands, says in response, \\"This is a completely meritless lawsuit. The plaintiffs saw the finished film numerous times before they chose to invest. In any event, David and Scott Hillenbrand and their team of top professionals did everything they could to try to get their investors a return on their investment, even to the Hillenbrands' own financial detriment, and, as stated in the Complaint, in spite of the plaintiffs' failure to provide the agreed upon P&A; funds in a timely manner. The Hillenbrands look forward to having the plaintiffs' completely meritless claims dismissed and to prosecuting their own claims.\\" In August, 2012, the Hillenbrands‚Äô production company, Hill & Brand Productions 7 LLC, counter-sued Third Eye Capital Corporation and Strative Capital LTD for fraud and breach of contract seeking damages of no less than $107,000,000.00 and alleging a scheme to defraud Hill & Brand Productions 7 LLC, and to exploit the name and reputation of the Hillenbrands for their own financial gain.

Like many of Scott- Heron's albums, the album's content primarily addresses political and social issues; however, The Mind of Gil Scott-Heron relies far more on his spoken word delivery than his other albums. Whereas much of the artist's earlier albums contained backup jazz-funk music from Brian Jackson, many of these tracks, which address contemporary issues such as Watergate, the pardon of Richard Nixon and the Attica Prison riot, are either live recordings or studio-recorded songs with little more than sparse drum backing or occasional instrumentation. Many of the tracks featured were included on previous Gil Scott-Heron albums. Due to the length of some of the pieces ‚Äì \\"The Ghetto Code (Dot Dot Dit Dit Dot Dot Dash)\\" is nearly 13 minutes long, and four other songs are longer than 7 minutes ‚Äì the album consists of only seven songs. One of the distinctive characteristics of Heron's poetry on this album is his use of chemical formulas to refer to certain people and events. For example, he refers to Barry Goldwater as \\"Barry AuH2O\\" and Watergate as \\"H2OGaTe\\". The original vinyl release of the album contained a 24-page booklet featuring transcriptions of 22 Gil Scott-Heron compositions.

The book began as a controversial series of articles in The Nation that set the Archbishop of New York against Eleanor Roosevelt. Despite some resistance, it became a bestseller, winning praise from well-known intellectuals. Catholic writers denounced it as bigoted and based on longstanding Protestant bias. Writings in The Nation Blanshard started doing the research behind the book in 1946 when he became concerned about the influence of Catholic doctrine on the practice of obstetrics. In the late 1940s, he published a series of articles that questioned and criticized specific activities and goals of the Catholic Church in the United States. Cardinal Francis Spellman, the Archbishop of New York, pressured New York school libraries to cancel subscriptions to The Nation, an action denounced by Eleanor Roosevelt.

Blanshard was later a vocal admirer of John F. Kennedy. William A. Donohue of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights calls it a \\"hate-filled\\" book that raised the \\"old canard of 'dual loyalties'\\" and included such \\"rubbish\\" as Blanshard's \\"Catholic Plan for America\\", which purportedly entailed \\"seizing the government, repealing the First Amendment, outlawing divorce, and making the pope the president's official superior\\".Donohue, William A., Secular Sabotage: How Liberals Are Destroying Religion and Culture in America, p. 81-82, Hachette Digital, Inc., 2009 Philip Jenkins, the Protestant author of The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, notes that the book contains echoes of the views of the American Protective Association and the Ku Klux Klan and, although Blanshard's plan of \\"resistance\\" to Catholicism did not prescribe the violence of those earlier anti-Catholic predecessors, that in the shadow of World War II readers would read the word resistance to have such an implication.Jenkins, Philip, The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, p. 37-38, Oxford University Press US, 2004 Catholic author Robert Lockwood states the work essentially makes a secularist argument, despite having its foundation in English anti-Catholicism of a Protestant variety.Lockwood, Robert P., Anti- Catholicism in American Culture, p. 42, 2000, Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Second edition, 1958 Beacon Press released a revised, second edition in 1958.Blanshard, Paul.

Lewis was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a well-to-do family. He started training at age 15 with German-born Paul Weber (1823‚Äì1916) of the Hudson River School. At age 19 he exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and was elected an Associate of the Academy at age 24. Crop of Darch's 1856 painting of Bellevue Mansion, the summer childhood home of Joseph Wharton, 3 miles north of Philadelphia, PA, looking south from Nicetown Lane. Career Lewis's early work in oil, because of his excellent training, was precocious and is considered technically superior to his later work. He traveled throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, painting river scenes, and for 2 decades he traveled to the White Mountains and painted landscapes of mountains, rivers, and lakes. He made extensive marine paintings throughout New England, becoming a prolific and successful artist. His work was appreciated because of the luminosity of their objects. Because of the lively yet glowing work, he is considered one of the Luminist painters in the Hudson River School. After mastering oil painting early in his career, Lewis switched to watercolor painting. Although not as technically outstanding, his watercolors were also admired for their luminosity - Luminism, and Lewis continued to generate canvases in mass production style. ;Later life Later in life, as an affluent artist Lewis collected decorative art, including furniture, ceramics, tapestries, and paintings by the masters. He had 2 adjacent homes constructed on 22nd St. in downtown Philadelphia to show his collection to Philadelphia society. ;Lake Willoughby Lewis's painting of Lake Willoughby (Vermont), a huge 80-inch canvas finished in 1867, is owned by the Pennsylvania Academy. The painting emphasized both the picturesque and sublime aspects of nature like other popular, mid-century popular spectacular panoramas of the Hudson River School.

Mayila supported some independent candidates at the time of the December 2006 parliamentary election, although none of them were successful; he did not personally stand as a candidate. Feeling marginalized within the PDG, he threatened to quit in order to create a new party. On 28 February 2007, PDG Secretary-General Simplice Ngu√©det Manz√©la publicly called on Mayila to abandon his threat and respect party discipline by discussing his complaints strictly within the party's internal structures.\\"Le secr√©taire g√©n√©ral du PDG demande √† son \\"camarade\\" Mayila de r√©viser sa position\\", Gabonews, 1 March 2007 .

Mayila remained supportive of Bongo following his dismissal from the government; in his office, he kept a photograph of himself whispering into Bongo's ear. Speaking to the Associated Press in March 2008, he said that Gabon was \\"neither dictatorship nor democracy, neither paradise nor hell. We are something in between.\\" While acknowledging the country's problems--\\"no roads, not enough schools, too much unemployment\\"--he stressed that Gabonese would \\"fix things on our own time, in our own way--peacefully--not through war.\\"Todd Pitman, \\"After Castro, African is longest-ruling\\", Associated Press, 22 March 2008. Omar Bongo died in June 2009. As the President of the UPRN, Mayila backed opposition candidate Pierre Mamboundou for the 30 August 2009 presidential election; the UPRN was one of several parties to support Mamboundou in an effort to unite behind a single opposition candidate. Immediately following the coalition's selection of Mamboundou, Mayila told the press on 21 July 2009: \\"You have asked for a single candidate for the opposition ... I offer you hope, I offer you a new way for Gabon.\\"Antoine Lawson, \\"Gabon Opposition Coalition Picks Mamboundou to Seek Presidency\\", Bloomberg.com, 21 July 2009. Following the election, Mayila held a press conference on 31 August 2009 in which he claimed that Mamboundou had won the election with 39.15% of the vote. The other two main candidates, Ali-Ben Bongo and Andr√© Mba Obame, also claimed victory, but Mayila said that the figures he provided, which included a breakdown of votes from each province, \\"demonstrate[d] clearly\\" that Mamboundou was the winner.\\"Gabon : Louis Gaston Mayila, ¬´qu'Ali ne commette pas la folie de se d√©clarer vainqueur¬ª\\" , GabonEco, 31 August 2009 .

Career B.Raman was born in Tamil Nadu and studied at the prestigious Loyola college in Chennai. He followed it up with a course in Journalism. Later he worked as a Journalist with the Indian Express in Chennai for 4 years. Later he cleared the civil services exam and was inducted as an IPS officer. Raman was an IPS officer of the 1961 batch who served for a time in the Madhya Pradesh cadre before deputation to the Intelligence Bureau in New Delhi. There, he was soon noticed by India‚Äôs spymaster, R.N. Kao, who took him to the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;) when it was formed in 1968. From very early on in his career, Raman displayed an unwavering commitment to his work. This, along with his vast knowledge and the ability to recall details of events even after the passage of decades made him a near ideal intelligence officer. These rare qualities prompted Kao and many of his successors to entrust Raman with some of the very sensitive tasks that the R&AW; undertook. It is said that on the suggestion of R.N. Kao, Raman was posted by R&AW; in Paris under the guise of an Indian correspondent working for The Hindu. There he is credited for having established a back channel with Ayotollah Khameini and the leadership of the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1978. He did so, using the assistance of an Iranian student in Paris whose life he had once saved. Having been one of the few surviving officers who were a witness to the creation of R&AW; during 1968 by R.N.

It is notable for both its significant architectural design and its unusual location. Built at the terminus of the Mount Evans Scenic Byway, it was the highest business structure in the United States. Constructed between 1940 and 1941, it served as a restaurant, gift shop and tourist attraction until it was partially destroyed by a fire in 1979. History Inspired by his first visit to Mount Evans in the 1920s, carpenter and German immigrant Justus \\"Gus\\" Roehling dreamed of constructing a \\"Castle in the Sky\\" for his then girlfriend (and future wife) Edith. Financial backing was provided by Thayer Tutt (owner of similar attractions atop Pikes Peak and the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs), and Quigg Newton, future mayor of Denver. With a design by notable Colorado architect Edwin A. Francis, ground was broken in the spring of 1940. Roehling, his wife and his crew lived in tents at the Mt. Evans Summit while construction was taking place. The extreme environment provided many challenges. No company would insure the building against loss or provide performance bonds during construction. Cold, damp conditions provided difficulties getting concrete to cure. All the materials had to be hauled to the summit or fabricated on site, and the high elevation afforded a building season limited only to summer months. With winter fast approaching, Roehling and his team were forced to abandon the uncompleted structure in fall of 1940. Upon returning in spring of 1941, Roehling found that much of the glass and woodwork had been destroyed during the hard alpine winter. Undeterred, Roehling and his team repaired the damage and completed construction by the fall of 1941. Crest House opened to much fanfare in fall of 1941. Amenities provided to travelers by Crest House included a restaurant, gift shop, rest rooms, emergency oxygen, and an observation deck. It was particularly well known for its fried doughnuts, coffee, and hot chocolate. Early employees were Denver area college students on their summer break, who resided in bunks located in the rear of the building. Thayer's Broadmoor Hotel Company operated the Crest House until 1956, when it was sold to the Stewart Corporation, which also operated the Pikes Peak Summit House. Then, in 1969, ownership reverted to the U.S. Forest Service, as per the terms of the original lease agreement. Destruction On September 1, 1979, while refilling a propane tank, an employee of an Evergreen propane company failed to secure a safety valve, igniting a fire. While the Idaho Springs volunteer fire department responded quickly, efforts to contain the fire were hampered by high winds and a lack of water. Fortunately, all the occupants were evacuated safely. Most of the steel, glass, and wood timbers, paneling, and flooring was destroyed in the fire, leaving only the cast concrete walls and outer stonework. The U.S. Forest service received a $450,000 settlement from the propane company for the loss. This was deemed insufficient to cover the estimated $2 million in restoration costs, so the funds were used to rehabilitate the ruins into an observation platform. Design Partially reconstructed ruins of Crest House Crest House represents a mixture of several different architectural styles, including Organic, Futuristic, Art Moderne. The overall design is intended to evoke a shooting star, with moon-shaped light fixtures inside completing the motif. The highlight of the design was the two-story star-shaped glass and steel platform. The upper floor housed an observation platform, while the lower floor housed the coffee shop. The star-shaped foundation is still evident on the observation platform today. The other main design feature are the four stone arches that flowed from the star platform that housed the main entrance to the building. These arches, like the rest of the concrete portions of the building, were faced with native stone, in order to better blend in with the environment. In fact, it blends in so well that the building can be difficult to see from a distance. These arches are still standing today. The interior was purportedly of an old-world style that Gus Roehling was fond of. This included details such as knotty panelling, sturdy timbers, hardwood floors, and heavy doors.

Pattison (APD-104), ex-DE-594, was a United States Navy high-speed transport in commission from 1945 to 1946. Construction and commissioning William J. Pattison was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS William J. Pattison (DE-594) on 4 January 1944 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts, and was launched on 15 February 1944, sponsored by Miss Sally McKillop. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-104 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 27 February 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Leslie W. Bennett, USNR, in command.  Service history  World War II Following shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and amphibious training at Hampton Roads, Virginia, William J. Pattison underwent post-shakedown repairs at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, between 20 April 1945 and 27 April 1945. On 27 April 1945, William J. Pattison departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, bound for New York City. There she rendezvoused with the transport USS General William Weigel (AP-119), and the two ships got underway on 1 May 1945 and headed for the West Indies. After a stop at San Juan, Puerto Rico, from 4 May 1945 to 8 May 1945, the two ships continued on to the Panama Canal Zone, where they arrived on 10 May 1945. William J. Pattison transited the Panama Canal on 12 May 1945 and set course for San Diego, California. Diverted en route in order to provide emergency medical treatment to an appendicitis victim on board a Liberty ship, she did not reach San Diego until 22 May 1945. William J. Pattison remained at San Diego only two days before putting to sea on 24 May 1945 in company with high-speed transports USS Begor (APD-127) and USS Cavallaro (APD-128). After a six-day voyage filled with gunnery drills and tactical exercises, the three high-speed transports arrived in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 30 May 1945. William J, Pattison spent the next two weeks in amphibious and underwater demolition team training in Hawaiian waters, mostly at Maui. On 13 June 1945, William J. Pattison embarked 10 officers and 50 enlisted men and got underway for the Marshall Islands, in company with Cavallaro and SS Cape Meares. The three ships entered the lagoon at Eniwetok on 21 June 1945, but on 23 June 1945 got underway again with a convoy bound for Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands. William J. Pattison remained at Ulithi from 26 June 1945 to 1 July 1945, when she began the two- day voyage to Leyte in the Philippine Islands. After eight days at Leyte, she headed back to Ulithi Atoll on 12 July 1945. In late July and early August 1945, William J. Pattison made two voyages from Ulithi Atoll to Okinawa. Though both visits were somewhat enlivened by air raid alerts, she saw no action. The surrender of Japan which ended World War II on 15 August 1945 found the ship on her way from Okinawa to the Mariana Islands. Postwar William J. Pattison arrived at Guam in the Marianas on 17 August 1945 and embarked Underwater Demolition Team 18. On 20 August 1945, she departed Guam in company with Begor and a group of tank landing ships (LSTs) to join the United States Third Fleet off Japan. William J. Pattison and Begor soon parted company with the slower LSTs and made the rendezvous with the Third Fleet on the night of 24‚Äì25 August 1945. USS William J. Pattison (right) alongside the Japanese battleship Nagato in Tokyo Bay in September 1945.William J. Pattison arrived in Tokyo Bay late in the afternoon of 27 August 1945 to begin her part in the postwar occupation of Japan. On 30 August 1945, she supported the United States Marines who occupied Yokosuka Naval Base, and her underwater demolition team unit carried out an inspection of the base's harbor facilities. Later, she participated in the demilitarization of captured Japanese warships. For the next month, William J. Pattison steamed among various Japanese bases located throughout the Japanese Home Islands, reconnoitering to prepare for their occupation by United States Marine Corps, United States Army, or U.S. Navy men. She also helped with further demilitarization projects. On 30 September, the ship got underway on the first leg of her journey back to the United States. After stops at Guam, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor, she arrived back in San Diego on 22 October 1945. William J. Pattison remained active with the Amphibious Forces, United States Pacific Fleet, into early 1946, when she moved to Green Cove Springs, Florida. Decommissioning and disposal William J. Pattison was decommissioned at Green Cove Springs sometime in March 1946. She remained in reserve there with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until 1 June 1960, when her name was stricken from the Navy List. On 18 January 1962, William J. Pattison was sold to the First Steel and Ship Corporation of New York City for scrapping. References NavSource Online: Amphibious Photo Archive USS William J.
