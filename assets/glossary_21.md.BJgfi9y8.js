Edmistone was born in Brisbane, Queensland. She was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.Australian Institute of Sport Swimming Hall of Fame In 2004, Edmistone emerged as an international calibre swimmer, at the Telstra Australian Short Course Championships. Her three swims in the heats, semifinals and final produced a Commonwealth record, an equalling of the world record and a new world record for the 50 m breaststroke (29.90s). She followed that with a personal best time to finish second to Olympic silver medallist Brooke Hanson in the 100 m breaststroke final to qualify for her second event at the FINA Short Course World Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana. At the World Championships, Edmistone won the silver medal in the 50 m breaststroke, just 0.01 s behind Hanson. She also took home silver in the 100m breaststroke, also behind Hanson. Edmistone qualified for her first long course international team in March 2005, when she won the 50 m breaststroke at the 2005 Australian Swimming Championships in Sydney. She had set national records twice on her way to the final. She won her first world title by breaking the world record in the 50 m breaststroke at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in July 2005, setting a time of 30.45 s. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games Trials in February 2006 in Melbourne, Edmistone set a new personal best in the 100 m breaststroke to become the 2nd fastest Australian of all-time, and further lowered her own world record in the 50 metres breaststroke to 30.31s. It was the first world record to be set at the new pool built for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. She claimed silver in both the 50 m and 100 m breaststroke at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, trailing Leisel Jones in both cases. Then followed up at the 2006 FINA Short Course World Championships in Shanghai with Gold in the 50 m breaststroke, bronze in the 100 m breaststroke and joined Tayliah Zimmer, Jessicah Schipper and Libby Lenton in the 4x100 m medley relay to take gold and set a new world record, beating the previous record by 3 seconds. Edmistone married fellow Australian swim team member Andrew Richards on 22 April 2006 in a ceremony held at Lyrebird Ridge Organic Winery, a property owned and managed by her aunt and uncle in the beautiful Shoalhaven. Since retiring from competitive swimming, Edmistone founded 'The ONCORE Academy' which assists with the development of individuals both in and out of the water. It provides products, programs and education specialising in building and strengthening fundamental swimming techniques and developing a strong mental wellbeing outside of sports . In 2016, Edmistone published her first book, Fish Out Of Water, which delves into her personal experiences as she transitioned from a life as an elite athlete into that of a 'normal' person. The book also has contributions from twelve other former elite female swimmers . Edmistone is also a passionate motivational speaker, who speaks about her experiences as a professional athlete, the highs and lows during her career and how she navigated through the transition from being a world champion to living a ‚Äònormal‚Äô life.

The Gallery's chief purpose is to present and support Polish contemporary art and artists. With numerous temporary exhibitions of well-known foreign artists, the gallery has also established itself internationally. The word \\"zachƒôta\\" means encouragement. The Zachƒôta Gallery takes its name from Towarzystwo Zachƒôty do Sztuk Piƒôknych (the Society for Encouragement of the Fine Arts), founded in Warsaw in 1860.  History  = Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts = Before 1860 there were neither public museums nor libraries nor other generally accessible institutions that allowed for exchange between artists. The repression that resulted from the November Uprising, made higher artistic education virtually impossible. The last major exhibition took place in 1845. After protests by artists during the 1850s, the Wystawa Krajowa Sztuk Piƒôknych (National Exhibition of Fine Arts) was approved in 1858, and lead to negotiations with Russian rulers who in the end permitted the foundation of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts in 1860. The Society's statutes were set by artists and art experts. The first official meeting and the election of a board of directors took place on 13 December 1860. The board had twelve members, six artists and six art experts, and was elected annually. The members remained in office for at least one month but no longer than one year. The primary aim of the Society was the dissemination of fine arts as well as support and encouragement of artists. Furthermore, its intention was to create general awareness of art among the Polish society. In 1860 the Society had 234 official registered members. Only one year later the number had increased to 1464. Initially, all artworks were on display until they were sold. Soon enough that lead to crowded walls and a monotonous permanent exhibition. After fundamental changes made between 1900 and 1939, the permanent exhibition was shown only in addition to temporarily changing exhibitions. The Society hosted annual salons, funded scholarships and offered other aid to young artists, both members and candidates. = The Building = The entrance to the building Zachƒôta Gallery, front view Zachƒôta - main hall and staircase First tenders for the design of a new building were put out in 1862. However, due to a lack of financial resources the plans were not realized. After the Society was given land by the municipality, another competition was announced in 1894, won by the Warsaw architect, Stefan Szyller. He presented an architectural design in neo-Renaissance style with classical elements. The portal is ornamented with allegorical figures and sculptural works by Zygmunt Otto. The architrave of the building is engraved with the Latin word Artibus. Construction work began in 1898. In December 1900, the front building was officially opened followed by the opening of the south wing in 1903. Both the opening and extension of the building were exceptionally well reviewed. Szyller's plans originally included the construction of two more wings which could not be implemented at that time. In 1958, the Ministry of Art and Culture decided to reconstruct the building. Surrounding houses had been destroyed during the war and thus, involuntarily, gave way to the extension of the building. The Warsaw architects, Oskar Hansen, Lech Tomaszewski and Stanis≈Çaw Zamecznikow, were entrusted with the reconstruction, but the planned reconstruction was postponed. In 1982, the reconstruction plans were taken up again and executed by the Shop for Preservation of Monuments. From 1991 to 1993, the reconstruction was supervised and executed by the company, Dom i Miasto (Home and City). The company was also responsible for the extension of the staircases inside the building, which allowed for direct access to the exhibition halls within the new part of the building. The resulting monumental perspective is emphasized by the Gladiator, a work by the Polish sculptor, Pius Welo≈Ñski, which remained from the Society's former collection. The extension of the building created a larger exhibition space, a storage facility for the artwork, an unloading platform and an office wing with a separate entrance. The largest exhibition hall was named after the Polish painter, Jan Matejko. Another room is named after Gabriel Narutowicz, the first president of the Second Polish Republic, who was assassinated at Zachƒôta on 16 December 1922 by Eligiusz Niewiadomski, a Polish painter and critic. To commemorate the president and Wojciech Gerson, one of the founders of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts, two plaques were revealed during the gallery's anniversary celebrations in 2000. Since its official opening in 1900, the Zachƒôta building has housed several institutions: * 1900‚Äì1939: Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts * 1939‚Äì1945: House of German Culture * 1945‚Äì1989: Central Bureau for Art Exhibitions * 1989‚Äì2003: Zachƒôta State Gallery of Art * since 2003: Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art The Zachƒôta building was registered as a historical monument in 1965. = 1939 to 1945= Zachƒôta looted by the Germans in July, 1944 During the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War almost all of the buildings surrounding the museum were destroyed while the Zachƒôta building remained comparatively undamaged. Following the Polish capitulation, German units occupied the building and converted it into the Haus der Deutschen Kultur (House of German Culture) which was mainly used for propaganda purposes. The Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts was dissolved. The artwork, as well as other documents belonging to the Society, were largely brought to the Muzeum Narodowe, or confiscated and sent to Germany. The transport took place on open trucks without any proper documentation. During the Warsaw Uprising the Zachƒôta building was heavily damaged by artillery and bombs and thus needed to be fully renovated at the end of the war. Traces of a flammable substance were found, suggesting that German units planned to set the building on fire before their withdrawal. = 1945 to 1989 = After the war, the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts was not reactivated. It was replaced by the Centralne Biuro Wystaw Artystycznych (Central Bureau for Art Exhibitions) which was founded in 1949 by the Ministry for Art and Culture at the request of the Association for Fine Arts, Poland. In 1951, the bureau began to host exhibitions. The first director (1949‚Äì1954) was Armand Vetulani. The central bureau was responsible for the organisation of art exhibitions, and all other artistic activity, throughout the entire country. Branch offices were opened in Krak√≥w, Katowice, Pozna≈Ñ, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Zakopane, Gda≈Ñsk, Szczecin, Wroc≈Çaw, Olsztyn and Opole. Eventually, the Central Bureau for Art Exhibitions became the most important institution in the area of cultural policy. The 1980s were characterized by radical political changes related to the declaration of martial law, leading to a boycott of all official galleries. In fact, the central bureau never really recovered from these drastic failures. = After 1989 = The fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the Iron Curtain changed political circumstances fundamentally, and also affected the structure of the central bureau. Barbara Majewska, the director of the bureau, moved the bureau away from its former old and centralistic structures, andon May 30, 1994, the Central Bureau for Art Exhibitions was closed and turned into the Zachƒôta State Gallery. In 2003, the Polish minister of culture, Waldemar DƒÖbrowski, renamed the gallery Narodowa Galeria Sztuki (National Gallery of Art).  Exhibitions  In 2000, the gallery marked its 100th anniversary with the exhibition, Polonia - Polonia. The exhibition included over 100 objects from different times and representing different types of media. All of the artwork presented national subjects. In the same year, the gallery opened the exhibition S≈Ço≈Ñce i inne Gwiazdy (The Sun and other Stars) based on a survey taken in 1999. The survey was directed primarily to Polish art historians, critics and curators, and asked for the most important artists of the 20th century. The result was two lists: one presenting the most important Polish artists and the other presenting the most important foreign artists. S≈Ço≈Ñce i inne Gwiazdy exhibited ten of the elected Polish artists: Magdalena Abakanowicz, Tadeusz Kantor, Katarzyna Kobro, Roman Opa≈Çka, Henryk Sta≈ºewski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski, Alina Szapocznikow, Witkacy, Witold Wojtkiewicz and Andrzej Wr√≥blewski. Also in 2000, the ten most important foreign artists were presented in another exhibit and consisted of Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Joseph Beuys, Marcel Duchamp, Wassily Kandinsky, Andy Warhol, Kazimir Malevich, Salvador Dal√≠, Piet Mondrian and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. In 2000, the Swiss art historian, Harald Szeemann, curated an exhibition featuring Maurizio Cattelans, La Nona Ora (The ninth Hour). The artwork shows Pope John Paul II hit and buried by a meteor. As the influence of the Catholic Church in Poland still is very strong, the presentation of Cattelan's work led to a public scandal.  Permanent Collection  Death of Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. a painting by J√≥zef Simmler. The collection began with a picture of J√≥zef Simmler's Death of Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Objects have come mainly from donations and wills. At the end of the 19th century, the collection already comprised over one thousand items. The permanent collection of Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art today comprises 3600 objects of which about 700 are paintings, almost 80 are video works and around 100 are sculptures and installations. In addition, the gallery owns an extensive collection of over 2600 works on paper such as graphic works, drawings and photographs. Polish artists from the 20th century, like Tadeusz Kantor, Henryk Sta≈ºewski and Alina Szapocznikow, are represented within the collection as well as Polish contemporary artists such as Miros≈Çaw Ba≈Çka, Katarzyna Kozyra, Zbigniew Libera, Wilhelm Sasnal and Krzysztof Wodiczko. The works of the collection not only reflect the often complicated past of the institution, but also show the focus of the gallery. Today, it concentrates on works of contemporary Polish artists, both works that have been shown in the gallery and works which were produced in cooperation with the gallery. Some of these projects are exhibited in other locations, such as the Polish Pavilion at the Biennale in Venice. There is no permanent exhibition of the collection. The works either become integrated in temporary shows or are on loan for exhibitions in other Polish institutions or abroad. Decisions about changes to the collection are made by the Commission for Purchases, Donations and Deposits, formed in 1990. Since 2008, the Department of Collections and Inventories is responsible for taking care of Zachƒôta's collection. =Gallery= Althamer P Lodz i skafander.JPG|Pawe≈Ç Althamer A Boat and a Space Suit Bujnowski R Obraz matki Whistlera.JPG|Rafa≈Ç Bujnowski Matka Whistlera D≈Çubak Z Plansza dydaktyczna I.JPG|Zbigniew D≈Çubak Teaching Board I /1-4/ Marlene Dumas Narutowicz. the President 1922.jpg|Marlene Dumas Narutowicz.

The catalogue collection is one of the most extensive in Poland. * Books about contemporary art and related subjects. * Magazines: Polish as well as foreign magazines about art in general. The Department for Documentation archives the lives and works of Polish artists since 1945. In addition to biographical notes, there is a list of exhibitions the respective artists took part in as well as newspaper clippings and exhibition catalogues. The archive is accessible but can only be used on-site. The gallery's bookshop is located on the ground floor of the building, offering catalogues, books and magazines of Polish and foreign artists as well as catalogues of exhibitions which took place at both the Zachƒôta and Kordegarda. The gallery also runs a separate Pedagogy Department which is responsible for the organisation of lectures, meetings and talks with artists and art historians, concerts, guided tours as well as educational programmes.  Project Kordegarda  Kordegarda Gallery The Kordegarda Gallery (literally: guardroom) was founded in 1956 as a branch of the Zachƒôta and situated on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie in Warsaw. It was an additional exhibition space, directed and organised by Zachƒôta, yet to a certain extent independent with regard to its exhibition programme. In 2010, the Kordegarda Gallery moved to Ga≈Çczynskiego street, just off the historic Ulica Nowy ≈öwiat (New World Street). While still directed by the Zachƒôta, the Kordegarda Gallery became more independent, devoting its attention to young artists, both Polish and foreign. The main idea is to present the artists within the context of urban structures and emphasize the cooperation of artist and gallery. In fact, the exhibition room is just as important as the art within, which is why every artist is asked to work individually with the exhibition room and design the artwork, especially for the given space. Currently, the Zachƒôta is updating both the concept and programme of the Kordegarda Gallery.  Controversies  In the past, the influence of the catholic church in Poland was demonstrated by the censoring of various exhibitions due to blasphemy. In December 2000, the Polish right-wing politician Witold Tomczak damaged Maurizio Cattelan's sculpture, La Nona Ora, and prompted the dismissal of director, Anda Rottenberg. In a letter addressed to the prime minister, Tomczak denounced Rottenberg, suggested that she should curate \\"rather in Israel than in Poland\\", and then demanded the dismissal of the \\"civil servant of Jewish origin\\". He also proposed prosecution due to violation of religious sentiments.

The battle between the two eventually caused two other chieftains, Te Ikanui and Wheru, to become besieged in their pƒÅ in Pawarenga on Whangape Harbour. To mask their escape, they burnt their possessions and escaped under the cover of the smoke.Nga korero o te Taumata Kaumatua Ahikaa o Ngati KuriTe Kooti Whenua Maori This is the iwi's chant: =Muriwhenua links= Te Aup≈çuri are one of the five iwi of Muriwhenua, also known as Te Hiku o te Ika a MƒÅui, the Far North of Aotearoa.

From these ancestors descend two families from which Te Aup≈çuri as an independent iwi trace their descent: Firstly, the family of M≈çre Te Korohunga and Te Awa. The name ‚ÄòTe Aup≈çuri‚Äô came about from an event in the time of M≈çre Te Korohunga and Te Awa‚Äôs children ‚Äì Kupe, Whƒìru, Te Ikanui, Te Kakati and Te UruhƒÅpainga, and Secondly, the family of Te Ihupango and Te Amongaariki II, who had two daughters ‚Äì Tihe and Kohine. Te Amongaariki II is especially important to Te Aup≈çuri being the principal ancestress of the Te Kao lands and the southern PƒÅrengarenga Harbour. The iwi of Te Aup≈çuri have their primary turangawaewae at Te Kao at the southern end of the PƒÅrengarenga Harbour, with Te Oneroa-a-T≈çhƒì (Ninety Mile Beach) to the west and Tokerau (Great Exhibition Bay) to the east. Te Aup≈çuri describe the core area in which they have customary rights and associations, of varying types and nature, as running from NgƒÅpae in the south-west, east to NgƒÅt≈´ and Waipapakauri Stream, north to the mouth of the Rangaunu Harbour, to Motu-puruhi and Te RƒÅkau-t≈´- hakahaka (Simmonds Islands) and north to Muri-motu (North Cape), west to Te Rerenga Wairua (Cape Reinga), encompassing Oromaki, Manawa-tƒÅwhi, Moe-kawa and Ohau (Three Kings Islands), south to Motu-o-Pao (Cape Maria van Diemen), to Kahokawa (Scotts Point), Matapia, Waka-te-hƒÅua (The Bluff), Hukatere and back to NgƒÅpae. Te Aup≈çuri also maintain historical associations to RangitƒÅhua (Raoul Island in the Kermadec Islands) and south to Waimimiha. Other iwi of Te Hiku o Te Ika also claim customary interests in this area. The people of Te Aup≈çuri share a number of well known ancestors with the iwi of wider Muriwhenua including: Ruanui-a-TƒÅne & Manawa-a-rangi; P≈ç-hurihanga & Maieke; T≈´-moana, Pare-waha-ariki & Kahukura-ariki; Te Parata & Kahu-tia-nui; T≈çhƒì & Te Kura-a-rangi; T≈´-mata-hina & Tangi-rere; Kai-rewa & Wai-miri-rangi; Toa- kai, T≈´-kotia & Tara-whati; HƒÅiti-tai-marangai & Puna; T≈´-whakatere, T≈´-te- rangi-a-tohia & T≈´-poia and Moko-h≈çrea & Uru-te-kawa. From these ancestors descend two families from which Te Aup≈çuri as an independent iwi trace their descent: firstly the family of M≈çre Te Korohunga of NgƒÅti Ruanui and his wife Te Awa of Muriwhenua, who became known as NgƒÅti Te Awa (the descendants of Te Awa). The name ‚ÄòTe Aup≈çuri‚Äô came about from an event in Pawarenga at the time of M≈çre Te Korohunga and Te Awa‚Äôs children ‚Äì Kupe, Whƒìru, Te Ikanui, Te Kakati and Te UruhƒÅpainga. One day, following the murder of Kupe, and her brother‚Äôs revenge, NgƒÅti Te Awa were besieged in Makora PƒÅ. Finally, NgƒÅti Te Awa lit a huge fire covering the Whangapƒì Harbour with thick dark smoke. They managed to escape north across the harbour in the midst of the dense smoke to their mother‚Äôs lands further north. Hence the name Te Aup≈çuri (au = smoke, p≈çuri = dark). The second family that Te Aup≈çuri descend from is that of Te Ihupango and Te Amongaariki II, who had two daughters ‚Äì Tihe and Kohine. Te Amongaariki II is especially important to Te Aup≈çuri being the principal ancestress of the Te Kao lands and the southern PƒÅrengarenga Harbour.

Matthews is an American politician from the state of Pennsylvania, and is a member of the Republican Party. He is a former member of the Board of Commissioners of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and was the unsuccessful 2006 Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania as Lynn Swann's running mate. Personal life Matthews graduated from La Salle College High School and attended College of the Holy Cross on a scholarship from the United States Navy. After serving in the Navy, Matthews entered the mortgage business and later earned an appointment as a mortgage lending officer with the Veterans Administration (VA) in Philadelphia. After leaving the VA, he returned to the private sector and later started his own mortgage business in 1990. Matthews is the brother of former MSNBC talk-show host Chris Matthews. Political career =Early involvement in politics= Matthews was first elected to the Board of Commissioners in 1999 with District Attorney Michael Marino. In the 1999 primary election Matthews defeated Mario Mele,1999 Primary Election Results, Montgomery County, 6/8/99 whom Republicans had accused of making a power sharing deal with the third commissioner, Democrat Joe Hoeffel, and supporting higher taxes in exchange for the commission chairmanship.Bradley Vasoli, Castor, Matthews Rally Around Lower Taxes, The Evening Bulletin, 5/25/07 In 2003, Matthews ran with Tom Ellis for the county commission. Facing incumbent Ruth Damsker and Frank Custer, the pair won, but with a narrower margin, less than 10,000 votes, than Republicans were accustomed to. Matthews courted some controversy in 2005 when he led an effort to ban cigarette smokers from working for the County. He and the commissioners reasoned that by outlawing smoking by County employees, they would be able to reduce health benefit costs. Later that year, the Commission retreated from that position, citing potential legal concerns. Montgomery County now offers anti-smoking aids to its employees as well as cash bonuses for those who stop smoking.County Commission Will Hire Smokers, Times Herald In 2006, he declared his candidacy for lieutenant governor. Lynn Swann endorsed him for the position and he subsequently won the May primary unopposed. In the fall general election however, Swann and Matthews were defeated by Democratic incumbent Ed Rendell, garnering only 39% of the vote. In 2007, Matthews made a third, successful bid for the commission. Early in the campaign, Matthews and Ellis were opposed for the Republican nomination by State Representative Kate Harper, former Lower Merion School Board member Jill Govberg, District Attorney Bruce Castor and former State Representative Melissa Murphy Weber. The challengers charged that Matthews and Ellis could not keep the county government in GOP hands in the upcoming election. Matthews countered that he could indeed win given his experience in county government and his name recognition. Running on his own, Matthews narrowly captured the party endorsement finishing behind Castor. Matthews and Castor faced off with Hoeffel, who sought to return to the commission after a stint in Congress, and incumbent Ruth Damsker in the general election. Matthews was attacked for support from Bob Asher and a lobbying contract awarded to party chairman Ken Davis. Matthews raised a campaign account separate from Castor and counterattacked Hoeffel and Damsker with charges that they would raise property taxes. On election day, Castor, Hoeffel and Matthews were all nominated, with the latter edging the incumbent Ruth Damsker by just over 6000 votes. Matthews received the lowest vote tally of the three. Matthews was, until his arrest, Chairman of the Board of Commissioners following a power sharing agreement with, ironically, his fellow candidate Hoeffel.Emilie Lounsberry, Philadelphia Inquirer, GOP and Dems split Montco; Castor on the outs, 12/18/2007 Matthews was formally censured by the Montgomery County Republican Committee (MCRC) on November 17, 2008 for his deal with Hoeffel, with the MCRC Chairman Robert Kerns declaring Matthews was \\"no longer a Republican\\".Derrick Nunally, Philsdelphia Inquirer, \\"Montco GOP Committee Censures Matthews\\", 11/19/08 =Legal and political issues= Despite announcing he would seek a fourth term without party support, Matthews withdrew from the contest, along with Hoeffel, after rumors of alleged violations of state Sunshine laws and awarding of no-bid contracts surfaced. A subsequent grand jury investigation was critical of both Hoeffel and Matthews over their discussions of county business over private breakfast meetings. Matthews was later arrested and charged with perjury. The day of his arrest, Matthews resigned as Chairman but not as Commissioner. Hoeffel and Castor summarily fired county solicitor Barry Miller, a close friend and ally of Matthews, who also served as Matthews' campaign treasurer and closest advisor. Castor nominated Hoeffel to the position of Chairman ruefully saying he did not want the chair for himself by likening the post to becoming \\"Captain of the Titanic after it hit the iceberg.\\" Matthews did not attend the public meeting where these actions took place. Hoeffel and Castor further ordered staff to consider how to remove Matthews from any boards or commissions on which he serves at the pleasure of the commission. Matthews subsequently resigned from all these positions after news accounts reported Hoeffel and Castor's intention to remove him. Matthews subsequently agreed to be placed into an accelerated rehabilitative disposition program for nonviolent offenders. He will serve a year of probation on one charge of perjury, after which time his record can be wiped clean of the perjury charge if he remains out of trouble. Matthews will also be forced to testify in a lawsuit against the county's contractor, XSPAND, for delinquent tax collections. The lawsuit, brought by a competitive firm, MRS, alleges that Matthews and Ellis, while they were Commissioners, improperly steered county business to XSPAND and pressured the borough of Norristown to hire it as well. They are also accused of improperly sharing confidential information with former Governor Mark Schweiker, a lobbyist for the firm. Matthews and Ellis countered that the contract generated significant savings in delinquent tax collection costs.Bradley Vasoli, Lawsuit Allegs Montco Commishes Leaked Info, The Evening Bulletin, 4/24/07 Jeff Shields, Bargain for taxpayers or pay-to-play?, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 4/25/07 Electoral history References External links Place of birth missing (living people) Year of birth missing (living people) Living people College of the Holy Cross alumni Montgomery County Commissioners (Pennsylvania) County commissioners in Pennsylvania People from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Republicans United States Navy officers ","title":"Jim Matthews (politician)"},{"id":"4022163","text":"Atom Eve (Samantha Eve Wilkins) is a fictional character, a superhero in the who appears primarily in the comic book Invincible.

She soon starts a friendship with Invincible after the two meet saving a shipment of video game consoles from a Mauler twin.Invincible #1 Eve and Mark are thought by many to be in a romantic relationship, despite their protests that they are \\"just friends\\".Invincible #4 After discovering that Rex Splode, her boyfriend, is cheating on her with Dupli-Kate, she resigns from the Teen Team.Invincible #6 & 8 Although she does not join the new Guardians of the Globe along with her former Teen Team teammates, she continues as an active superhero for some time. She eventually decides that her talents are being wasted on superheroics and that she could do more good elsewhere. Subsequently she quits superhero work and moves to Africa to engage in aid work.Invincible #19-20 She has come out of \\"retirement\\" in response to large threats, like the cosmic villain Omnipotus and a Martian invasion.Invincible #39-41 In Invincible #34, Invincible meets a version of Atom Eve from 15 years in the future who confesses her undying love for him. She instructs him to either tell her that he loves her or that he hates or doesn't want anything to do with her romantically, so that she could get on with her life.Invincible #37 While Invincible is recovering from the incident with the Reanimen, he flies to meet Eve, whom he had not talked to since the fight with Angstrom Levy. After sharing a friendly hug and an awkward pause afterwards, they share a passionate kiss. Immediately afterward, however, Mark apologizes and voices his guilt at going behind his girlfriend's back, and is relieved to be called to fight off an alien invasion.Invincible #38 After hearing that Invincible broke up with his girlfriend, Eve shows up at his dorm asking, \\"So -- are we dating or what?\\",Invincible #43 but leaves without a word when he tells Eve about his encounter with her future self. In issue 50, the situation is resolved after Invincible returns from his encounter with Cecil Stedman. He and Eve reconcile and kiss, suggesting that they are now a couple. By issue 58, Eve and Invincible are in a serious relationship, having consummated their love for each other after a date that literally spanned the globe. Eve has since moved back in with her parents so she would be closer to Invincible but their strictness as well as Mark's wanting to spend more time away from his home has caused them to want to live together in their own home. Their goal, however, is somewhat strained by their lack of money. Eve takes it upon herself to find a solution to both their money problems. Fashioning a business suit for herself, Eve visits and leaves Stronghold Penitentiary secretly. When Invincible approaches her after hearing about her visit, Eve tells him her plan, which she was saving as a surprise: Eve had been visiting Stronghold and other such scenes where other super- villain battles have taken place (not shown but rather alluded to in her dialogue) in the hopes of creating a super-protection service wherein Invincible would be paid to be on-call to protect certain locations from threats, ultimately being paid to do what he would normally be doing for free. With Eve in charge of the business end of the venture, she calculates that they would earn enough money in four months to afford their own place. Although the business has yet to be established officially, Invincible is quite surprised by her resourcefulness and agrees. Following the events of the disastrous Invincible War, Eve is in a coma and remains that way for most of the aftermath. Once she awakens, she learns of Mark's battle with the Viltrumite named Conquest and insists on joining the fight. Cecil agrees, mostly because he is short on allies. Eve dons her costume and flies to the scene where she tries to contain Conquest with her force fields. This proves ineffective when Conquest gravely injures her by punching a hole in her stomach. Eve appears to die, but suddenly recovers as Invincible continues to battle with Conquest. Releasing a bolt of energy, she significantly injures Conquest, and Invincible is able to finish the battle and put a stop to the Viltrumite's takeover of Earth. Her recovery is explained as a result of massive trauma temporarily disabling the blocks that prevent her from altering organic matter, as seen in Invincible Presents: Atom Eve #2. Atom Eve made unconscious \\"slight improvements\\" during her recovery, resulting in a larger bust.Invincible #65 That same evening, Eve and Mark make love. As Mark continues to assist in the cleanup, Eve suggests that they expand their ranks for their job program, believing Oliver would be suitable candidate to join their group. Later that night, Eve takes a pregnancy test that reads positive upon completion. Since that time, several months have passed while Mark was in space during the Viltrumite War story arc. Mark returns to Eve ten months later. During that time she gains weight, due to refraining from using her powers, which actually burn a lot of calories. Mark embraces her. Eve is asked by William if she told him yet and she says no. The next issue reveals that the truth is that she had an abortion.Invincible #79 Powers and abilities Atom Eve is able to manipulate matter at the sub-atomic level by sheer will power. Organic (not animal life, however) and inorganic matter can be changed into anything she desires. She can augment normally unhealthy food such as cakes and other sweets into nutritious foods as well as re-arrange the environment. Her costume is created by altering her clothes to fashion her Atom Eve suit. She can also fly by lowering the density of the air around her as well as creating force fields.Invincible #25 (August 2005) Atom Eve has the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atomic particles through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. In this way she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting, and each is unharmed. This process is called \\"phasing\\" or quantum tunneling and it renders her almost completely intangible to physical touch. Atom Eve can pass through objects at the same speed at which she is moving before she enters them. Since she is unable to breathe while inside an object, she can only continuously phase through solid objects (as when she travels underground) as long as she can hold her breath. However, contrary depictions of the duration of her phasing ability have been presented, such as when she has phased miles within an object. The use of her abilities also interferes with any electrical systems as she passes through by disrupting the flow of electrons from atom to atom, including the bio-electric systems of living bodies if she concentrates in the right way. This typically causes machines to malfunction or be destroyed as she phases through them, and can induce shock and unconsciousness in living beings. A downside to Atom Eve's transmutation powers is that she absorbs any unused atoms into her body, which must later be eliminated from her system as waste. She claims that on days when she uses her powers a lot she can \\"go to the bathroom\\" six or seven times.Official Handbook of the Invincible Universe #1 (Dec 2006)  Notes  Characters created by Robert Kirkman Female characters in comics Invincible (comic) Skybound Entertainment superheroes ","title":"Atom Eve"},{"id":"4022164","text":"Richard T.

The village grew during the ownership of Joseph Hirst into a small model village and was later acquired by William Lever, founder of Lever Brothers, the predecessor of Unilever. Thornton Hough is roughly ten miles from Liverpool and ten miles from Chester and part of the Clatterbridge Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the parliamentary constituency of Wirral South. At the 2001 Census, Thornton Hough had 770 inhabitants. History Mentioned in the Domesday Book as Torintone, the name of the village was established when the daughter of local landowner Roger de Thorneton, married Richard de Hoghe during the reign of Edward II. By the beginning of the 19th century, Thornton Hough formed part of the Neston Estate owned by Baron Mostyn of Mostyn, Flintshire. The population was 165 in 1801, 164 in 1851, 547 in 1901 and 506 in 1951. Joseph Hirst, a Yorkshire woollen millowner, bought farmland land in 1866 and began the development of a small model village, building a church, a school and 'Wilshaw Terrace'. The village was bought and expanded by William Lever who developed housing for family, estate workers and company staff in a similar way to Port Sunlight, building another shop, the school, a social club and the Congregational church. Development continued in the early 20th century. Geography Thornton Hough is in the central part of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at Leasowe Lighthouse, north-east of the Dee Estuary at Parkgate and about west-south-west of the River Mersey at Bromborough. The centre of the village is situated at an elevation of between above sea level. Landmarks All Saints Church Thornton Hough and the villages of Brimstage and Raby are in an Area of Special Landscape Value, a protective designation to preserve the character and appearance of the area There are 22 listed buildings in the village which was made a conservation area in 1979. Hirst employed Kirk and Sons of Huddersfield to design All Saints Church and its vicarage, a school and school master‚Äôs house and Wilshaw Terrace before 1870. All Saints, the parish church, is a grade II listed building built in 1867, it has a spire and tower displaying five clock faces. The north transept window, designed by H. Gustave Hiller is a memorial to Joseph Hirt. Lever's architects used a wide variety of building materials including red and buff sandstone, brick, timber framing, render and pebbledash with roofs made of clay tiles or thick stone slates which creates the impression that the village appears to be older than it is. Lever used several architects, including John Douglas. The firm of Grayson & Ould designed the Village Club and Post Office, Weald House, several houses in The Folds and rebuilt Thornton House in 1895 and designed its lodges and stables. Jonathon Simpson built the Lever School and his son, James Lomax-Simpson, rebuilt the Smithy, designed D‚ÄôArcy Cottages and extensions to Thornton House. He also designed Saint George's United Reformed Church, a reproduction Romanesque style church in 1906. William and Segar Owen designed various houses including Thicketford. Thornton Hall, once the home of wealthy shipping merchants, the Bamford Brothers of Liverpool, is believed to have been built in the mid-1800s. It was transformed into a hotel in 1954 and many of its original features remain intact including oak carvings and the ornate mother of pearl embossed ceiling in the Italian Room. Thornton Manor, built in an Elizabethan style dates from the 1840s, and was once the home of Lord Leverhulme. It is now a wedding venue and provides facilities for corporate functions. Thornton House, a grade II listed building built by Douglas & Fordham in 1893 is a two storey timber-framed house in a mock-Tudor style on a stone base. Thicketford built in 1892 is preserved in a largely unaltered condition. Hesketh Grange, a grade II listed building, was built in 1894 for Leverhulme's father. Governance Thornton Hough was a township in the parish of Neston, part of the Wirral Hundred and became a civil parish in 1866. It was part of the Wirral Rural District in Cheshire from 1894 until it was superseded in 1933 by the Wirral Urban District. Further changes occurred on 1 April 1974, when local government reorganisation resulted in most of Wirral, including Thornton Hough, being transferred from the county of Cheshire to the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in Merseyside. Amenities Thornton Hough's central feature is the village green with its cricket pitch and pavilion, tennis courts, and a children's play area. The local primary school is Thornton Hough Primary School located on St George's Way and is the catchment school for children living in Thornton Hough, Raby Mere, Raby and Brimstage. This school building was originally built to serve as a military building, but was turned over for school usage after the Second World War. The original playground has been reduced in size due to the building extensions of decking and garden areas. The Parish Hall was the original village school until it closed in 1953, it has a Victorian exterior, although its interior has been updated. The Village Hall is a large extension to the original wooden hall belonging to St George's Church and was built in the 1970s by Collins Construction. It is referred to as the New Village Hall to set it apart from the Parish Hall which is used for the fortnightly youth club. Since it opened, the hall has been used for a variety of local events and as a venue for parties. The hall is used by the badminton club, play-school, Cubs, Scouts, Rainbows, Brownies and Guides. The village has a number of shops and a post office next to which is the British Legion, known as \\"the Men's Club\\" as women were barred except for on two days per year. The Village Stores struggled to compete with the bigger and cheaper supermarkets before its closure in 2007. It is now Jennifer O'neill Cakes and Dragonfly Couture Stationery, 'The Seven Stars', is a traditional pub established in the 1840s on what was once a turnpike route between Birkenhead and Neston. In 1905 the smithy moved from its original site into a half timbered building and was extant in 2009. A Punch and Judy show on the village green. Just outside the village is The Red Fox, a public house and restaurant on the border of Thornton Hough and Neston. =Festival= The Thornton Hough Scarecrow Festival was held between 1999 and 2006. Residents participating made scarecrows of varying designs and quality, which were judged at the end of a week-long open season which attracted visitors from local areas. The festival also included a f√™te on the village green. The festival was not held between 2007 and 2010, but there are plans for a smaller scale revival in 2011. However, this did not happen as the festival was deemed to \\"attract the wrong sort of people\\". There are hopes that the festival will soon be revived.

Musical style  The band's original style, featured on their releases up to and including Allegro Barbaro and on a few songs on All You Need Is Love, consists of death/thrash metal blended with melodic compositions. In later albums, the death metal influence declined, resulting in less chaotic composition (often centered around a verse and chorus with a bridge and solo), more constant tempo, longer songs and clean vocals (although not exclusively). This resulted in a more polished and accessible sound. The band uses lyrics in both English and German with a shift from mainly English songs to more German ones on recent albums (Licht is entirely in German). The release of Have a Nice Trip marked somewhat of a turning point for the band. Although they retained the essence of heavy metal, they began experimenting with many other styles of music such as ambient and jazz.

She is best known for the Mrs. Pollifax series. Begun in a time when women in mystery meant Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and international espionage meant young government men like James Bond and the spies of John le Carr√© and Graham Greene, Emily Pollifax, her heroine, became a spy in her 60s and is very likely the only spy in literature to belong simultaneously to the CIA and the local garden club.The New York Times ‚Äî Books, Dorothy Gilman, ‚ÄòMrs. Pollifax‚Äô Novelist, Dies at 88 by Margalit Fox, February 3, 2012 Biography Dorothy Gilman was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to minister James Bruce and Essa (Starkweather) Gilman. She started writing when she was 9. At 11, she competed against 10- to 16-year-olds in a story contest and won first place. Planning to write and illustrate books for children, she attended Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts 1940-1945.{ {New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams, 14.4 (March‚ÄìApril 2007): 49(1)} } She married teacher Edgar A. Butters, Jr. September 15, 1945; they divorced in 1965. The couple had two children, Christopher and Jonathan. Gilman attended the University of Pennsylvania 1963-1964. She was Unitarian. Gilman worked as an art teacher and telephone operator before becoming an author. She wrote children's stories for more than ten years under the name Dorothy Gilman Butters and then began writing adult novels about Mrs. Pollifax, a retired grandmother who becomes a CIA agent. The Mrs. Pollifax series made Gilman famous. Gilman's life is strongly reflected in her writing. She traveled extensively, and her travels became the settings for her Mrs. Pollifax books. In the 1970s, she moved to a property in a small town in Nova Scotia where she grew most of her own vegetables and herbs. This period was the focus of her memoir, A New Kind of Country. Her knowledge of medicinal herbs informed several of her stories, including A Nun in the Closet and Thale's Folly. Thale's Folly is one of her few books featuring a male protagonist; most of her books feature strong women having adventures around the world. In addition to Nova Scotia, Gilman spent much of her life in Connecticut, Maine, and New Mexico. In 2010 Gilman was awarded the annual Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America. In 2012, she died at age 88 of complications of Alzheimer's disease.

The first Little Tavern opened March 24, 1927, in Louisville, Kentucky, by Harry F. Duncan. The first Washington location was opened in October 1928 and the first in Baltimore opened its doors in June 1930. By 1937, there were 33 shops open. At the height of the chain, there were almost 50 locations. Duncan sold the chain in 1981. The chain had troubles in the 1990s and the last restaurant closed on April 29, 2008, although the Laurel location was re-opened that year as Laurel Tavern Donuts after being given the recipe for the burgers,which it still served as of 2018. The original slogan of the chain was \\"Buy 'em by the bag\\", and its signs promised \\"Cold Drinks * Good Coffee\\". The stores were quite small and could accommodate only a few seated customers, while most business was take-out. From 1928 to 1931, Little Taverns had block construction and their castle design closely resembled White Castles and White Towers of the same era.

This growth led to overcrowding at elementary schools, necessitated busing to transport students to schools when there was no existing facility near their home and required the use of trailers at the Middle School to accommodate the influx of students. With additional property zoned for residential use, school population was expected to grow in the years ahead. In the State of New Jersey, schools are funded primarily by property taxes, which increased at a rate of 7% annually from 2000 to 2007. Rapid rises in property taxes tend to cause seniors and empty-nesters to sell their existing homes to families with children, which led to further increases to the school-age population. In December 2004, following a public campaign in its support, voters approved a $106.1 million referendum for the additions and improvements at Central, Lawrence Brook, and Hammarskjold Middle Schools.Staff. \\"Referendum's approval in E.B.'s best interest\\" , East Brunswick Sentinel, December 9, 2004. Accessed November 22, 2011. \\"The $106.1 million project that is on the ballot would provide a new, larger Hammarskjold building, and more classrooms at the Lawrence Brook and Central elementary schools.... Local taxpayers' share of the cost, at $81.4 million, is a lot to swallow. And it does arrive on the heels of some lofty school tax increases to support the operating budget and recent construction projects that relieved overcrowding at the junior high and high school levels.... Enrollment has increased by nearly 1,000 students at the K-7 level since the mid-1990s; class sizes range from 25 to 30 depending on the grade level; and many of the schools, at 40 to 50 years old, need renovating. Previous bond referenda in 1994 and 1995 had failed to obtain voter approval. For 2004, an additional ca. $54 million believed necessary for renovations at other East Brunswick School facilities (which would have brought the total to $160 million) was deferred. Of this sum, $24.7 million was to be contributed by the State of New Jersey. The rebuilding of Hammarskjold Middle School was planned to cost $66.5 million, of which $12.3 million was to have come from the State. Central School renovation and expansion were planned to cost ca. $20.7 million, of which $6.4 million was to have come from the State. Lawrence Brook School renovation and expansion were expected to cost ca. $19 million, of which ca. $6 million was to have come from the State. =Decommissioned facilities= Several older prewar school facilities in East Brunswick have been decommissioned. They date from the period before the rapid expansion of East Brunswick in the 1960s and provide a glimpse of how the Township appeared before the burgeoning residential build-outs of the 1950s and, on minimum-1/3 acre plots, of the 1960s. The few prewar school structures that remain are readily identifiable as red-brick, two-story buildings. McGinnis School (at Dunhams Corner Road and Hardenburg Lane), opened in 1926 and last used for instruction in 1978, was demolished in January 2015. It has been replaced by a parochial school building of similar form, built by Torah Links of Middlesex County., \\"Outreach group clears site for its new home,\\" NJJN, February 9, 2015; accessed June 6, 2017 Weber School (at Riva Avenue and Hardenburg Lane), a near-twin of McGinnis, was sold in 2006 to St. Mary Coptic Orthodox Church, which continues to use the building as a school., \\"Town will sell school site to Riva Avenue Church,\\" GMNews, February 9, 2006; accessed June 6, 2017 Special education Special education is a key component of the education provided by East Brunswick Public Schools to eligible students. East Brunswick Public Schools provides such services in compliance with the Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and related State of New Jersey Statutes. Accordingly, each eligible student is educated in a least restrictive environment (LRE) according to an individualized education plan (IEP) drafted by his or her child study team (CST) consisting of school personnel and parents. Eligibility determinations are made every three years. Special services may include speech therapy, occupational therapy, educational aides, and other services as appropriate and called for. A Director of Special Education, currently Sharon Weber-Oleszkiewicz, manages East Brunswick Public Schools' program of providing special services. At the district level, the Director is supported by a Supervisor of Elementary School Special Education, a Supervisor of Secondary School Special Education, and a Supervisor of Autism Spectrum Program. Special education is supported at the schools by individual professionals including specialists (math, reading, and speech), special education teachers, teacher resource personnel, teacher aides, and child study team personnel (a category which may include psychologists, learning disabled teaching consultants, and social workers). These individuals come into direct contact with those students who require special services. Students receiving special services may be eligible for participation in an extended school year (ESY) program by which they attend instructional classes during the summer. Pre-school and kindergarten students eligible for special education services receive instruction from an early age and full-time kindergarten (conventionally, East Brunswick Public Schools offers only half-day kindergarten). There are multiple resources and support groups available to parents of disabled children. For example, the State of New Jersey operates the Division of Developmental Disabilities. The East Brunswick Special Education PTA (SEPTA) offers a valuable website. Another organization of value for those interested in autism-spectrum disorder is COSAC (Center for Outreach and Services for the Autism Community), and yet another is ASPEN (Asperger's Syndrome Education Network). =Individualized Education Program (IEP) process= East Brunswick Public Schools has a commitment to special education. The processes mandated by IDEA, while saving the educational lives of many affected students, also pose many challenges to educators and parents. The IEP process can be lengthy. A child requiring special services needs a substantial investment in time on the part of the parents, the child's greatest advocate. Parents need to consider outside evaluations and consult with others. Parents may refer to the published curricula made available by East Brunswick Public Schools at The East Brunswick Public Library. East Brunswick Public Schools uses \\"leveled reading\\" terminology to specify reading skills. Leveling schemes are highly technical. One scheme by which, e.g., \\"Level J\\" is an end-of-first-grade reading level, is the Fountas and Pinnell \\"Benchmark Assessment\\" System. Achieving a properly defined plan, it is important to conduct a full and proper evaluation. The individualized aspect of the IEP is critical. Educating a special needs child is a project. Project planning is a discipline in industry and government. It can be challenging to provide the ongoing monitoring of progress and support of course-correction activity that is required to provision a high-quality planned educational program to eligible students. The IDEA guarantees the services needed by special students. It is wise for parents to familiarize themselves with relevant portions of the IDEA text. Alternatively one may team with an advocate who can, potentially, attend the IEP meetings with parents.

Structure The nuchal ligament extends from the external occipital protuberance on the skull and median nuchal line to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra in the lower part of the neck. From the anterior border of the nuchal ligament, a fibrous lamina is given off. This is attached to the posterior tubercle of the atlas, and to the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae, and forms a septum between the muscles on either side of the neck. The trapezius and splenius capitis muscle attach to the nuchal ligament. Function It is a tendon-like structure that has developed independently in humans and other animals well adapted for running. In some four-legged animals, particularly ungulates, the nuchal ligament serves to sustain the weight of the head. Clinical significance In Chiari malformation treatment, decompression and duraplasty with a harvested ligamentum nuchae showed similar outcomes to pericranial and artificial grafts. =Other animals= In sheep and cattle it is known as the paddywhack. It relieves the animal of the weight of its head. Dried paddywhack is commonly packaged and sold as a dog treat. In most other mammals, including the great apes, the nuchal ligament is absent or present only as a thin fascia.Swindler, D. R., and C. D. Wood. 1973 An Atlas of Primate Gross Anatomy. Seattle: University of Washington Press As it is required for running, not all animals have one. All dogs (and all living Canidae - wolves, foxes, and wild dogs) possess a similar ligament connecting the spinous process of their first thoracic (or chest) vertebrae to the back of the axis bone (second cervical or neck bone), which supports the weight of the head without active muscle exertion, thus saving energy.Wang, Xiaoming and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. pp.97-8 This ligament is analogous in function (but different in exact structural detail) to the nuchal ligament found in ungulates. This ligament allows dogs to carry their heads while running long distances, such as while following scent trails with their nose to the ground, without expending much energy.

It has two campuses: the main campus of 79,000 square metres and 9,147 square metres in the city proper, and the satellite campus of 200,000 square metres in San Ramon about 20 kilometers from the city. Campuses comprising the external studies units are in the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga Sibugay. It has a student population of over 32,000, regular faculty members of over 600 and over 200 administrative personnel. It has 15 colleges, one institute and two autonomous campuses offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses specializing in accounting, education, engineering, nursing, arts and humanities, social work, science and mathematics. Along with these major fields of concentration, WMSU also offers courses in agriculture, architecture, forestry, home economics, nutrition and dietetics, computer science, criminology, Asian and Islamic Studies and special degree courses for foreign students. It also offers external studies and non-formal education courses. WMSU ranked sixth among 68 universities all over the country, according to a survey on the Top Academic Institutions in the Philippines conducted by the Commission on Higher Education. The university's College of Teacher Education is a Center for Development; the College of Architecture is a Center of Development; and the College of Social Work and Community Development was awarded the Best School for Social Work in the Philippines. History With the cessation of the hostilities that marked the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Filipino and American educators agreed that the best way to rebuild a devastated nation was through the establishment of a sound education system. Eight Normal schools were then established in the Philippines by the Americans. One of them was the Zamboanga Normal School established in 1904. As a secondary school, the ZNS offered a general academic curriculum under the Department of Mindanao and Sulu primarily designed to cater to the needs of cultural minorities in the provinces of Cotabato, Davao, Lanao, Sulu, and Zamboanga. In June 1921, the secondary normal curriculum of the Zamboanga Normal School had to be phased out for lack of enrollees. It was re-opened the following year and produced its first batch of graduates in 1926. Until the end of school year 1939-40, the general secondary academic and normal curricula continued to be simultaneously offered. As a result of the opening of the Zamboanga City High School in 1939, the general secondary academic curriculum was discontinued but was offered at the college level. It was briefly disrupted with the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, the school resumed operations enabling those who started first year in the two-year collegiate normal curriculum before the war to continue as sophomore students. In April 1946 they were awarded the Elementary Teacher's Certificate (E.T.C.). The secondary normal curriculum was offered only during the summer term until 1952. Upon its conversion to the Zamboanga Normal College on June 17, 1961 by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 3272, the ZNC was placed under the direct supervision of the Bureau of Public Schools (BPS) until its autonomy in 1963. Gradually, it started to offer new degree programs. Zamboanga del Norte Agricultural College' was the former name of the Tampilisan campus of Western Mindanao State University. The passage of Republic Act No. 3889 on June 18, 1964, caused the conversion of Zamboanga del Norte National Agricultural School in Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte to become a college known as Zamboanga del Norte Agricultural College. The amendment of RA 3272 on June 26, 1969 by RA 5492 resulted in the conversion of the Zamboanga Normal School into the Zamboanga State College (ZSC). Considering the demands of a growing population in a rapidly changing society, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Presidential Degree No. 1427 on June 10, 1978, marking the birth of the Western Mindanao State University. Since its conversion into a state university, three university presidents have taken its leadership: Dr. Juanito A. Bruno, who served from 1977 to 1986; Dr. Bernabela L. Ko as first full-pledged president from 1986 to 1991; and Dr. Erdulfo B. Fernando, who served from 1991 to 1997. Dr. Eldigario D. Gonzales, DPA, CSEE had served as university president from 1997 to 2007. Today, WMSU has a total of 1,000 teaching and administrative support staff catering to over 20,000 students. It has become the Center of Excellence (COE) and for Teacher Education and Project for Basic Education (PROBE) Center. Serving as WMSU's President is Dr. Milabel Enriquez Ho, who was also former dean of the College of Nursing, and also served as Vice President of WMSU.

It is basically a dish of ham or pork shoulder with dried apples and dumplings. Apple snitz are dried slices of apples, and knepp (from German \\"Kn√∂pfe\\" for \\"buttons\\") are rivels (dumplings). Although the Amish arrived in the early 18th century, this food was not common until the early 19th century, when Johnny Appleseed planted many orchards on the frontier of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. At the time, home canning was not yet practical, so the apple crop was preserved in liquid form (most commonly as hard cider) or sliced and dried, the finished slices being called snitz. Apples other than named varieties grafted from a parent tree, were usually small, misshapen and rather tart - because of Johnny Appleseed's Swedenborgian faith, he sold only ungrafted trees - but drying the snitz concentrates the fruit sugars, making them a bright spot in an otherwise dreary diet. Today, commercial producers of apple snitz use named-variety apples that cannot be sold as fresh because of blemishes, and they peel the apples. The peelings do not go to waste; they are pressed for cider. Some home orchards may have a tree that produces tart apples, prized for the flavorful snitz they make. They may also choose to only core and slice their apples, not peeling them. The dish uses rivels made from flour, milk, baking powder, butter, salt, and eggs, and the dish is flavored with ham, traditionally salt- cured \\"country ham\\", although honey ham, pork butt, or other pork may be used. Onions, potatoes, cloves, cinnamon and brown sugar are optional ingredients. An alternative knepp is a yeast dumpling made without sugar. This recipe calls for long cooking, and is thus a winter dish. The pronunciation is \\"snitz-en- nep\\".

After approximately 6 years of study, he moved to Milan to further his learning with Leandro Bisiach. Between 1956 and 1988 Sesto served on every prestigious violin making body including an appointment (1980) as the custodian of the Niccol√≤ Paganini Guaneri del Gesu ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù. He acquired over 17 international competition awards for his violins from 1952 to 1966. Sesto Rocchi made as many as ten quartets and a few antiqued instruments following in the steps of his masters, Sgarabotto and Bisiach. His experience in the Leandro Bisiach workshop where he made many instruments and where he could observe and copy antique instruments was extremely useful to his own career. =Rocchi honored= To mark the 50th anniversary of the foundation of their club, the members of the Rotary of Reggio Emilia in Italy organized a tribute (in the spring of 1999) to noteworthy personalities of their town, including violin maker Sesto Rocchi.

The raid was known as Operation Jaywick. The MV Krait is on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) in Sydney. History Krait was originally a Japanese fishing vessel based in Singapore named Kofuku Maru. Following the outbreak of war, the ship was taken over by Allied forces and used to evacuate over 1,100 people from ships sunk along the east coast of Sumatra. The ship eventually reached Australia via Ceylon and India in 1942, and was handed over to the Australian military. In Australian service, she was renamed Krait after the small but deadly snake. In September 1943, Krait transported members of Z Special Unit to Singapore, where they successfully raided the city's harbour, sinking seven ships. She returned to Australia in October. Krait was used by the Australian military throughout the war, and was present at the surrender of the Japanese forces on Ambon in September 1945. Krait was later used as transport for intelligence-gathering missions to islands in the area, including Buru, Aru, Ceram, Banda, and Saparua. During this period, she carried several Japanese prisoners, army survey teams, and a naval intelligence officer. At Ambon, the boat acquired a monkey as a mascot. He was named Peter and had lost his tail. Peter remained with the crew until Krait finished her service and was towed to Morotai. She was then sailed to Labuan, where she was sold and handed over to the British Borneo Company and where Able Seaman Robert Harry Easom of Perth kept its ensign as a souvenir. That ensign is now on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. After its sale, Krait was operated off Borneo until she was purchased for use as an Australian Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol vessel in 1964. On Anzac Day 1964, Krait was formally dedicated as a war memorial by the governor of NSW. A plaque was affixed to the wheelhouse and is shown below. She was then acquired by the Australian War Memorial in 1985 and was lent to the Australian National Maritime Museum, where she has been displayed to the public since 1988.

It was first published by Harcourt, Brace & World (New York). Synopsis Mumford argues for a world not in which technology rules, but rather in which it achieves a balance with nature. His ideal vision is what can be described as an \\"organic city,\\" where culture is not usurped by technological innovation but rather thrives with it. Mumford contrasts these cities with those constructed around wars, tyrants, poverty, etc. However, the book is not an attack on the city, but rather an evaluation of its growth, how it came to be, and where it is heading, as evidenced by the final chapter \\"Retrospect and Prospect.\\" Mumford notes apologetically in his preface that his \\"method demands personal experience and observation,\\" and that therefore he has \\"confined [him]self as far as possible to cities and regions [he is] acquainted with at first hand.\\"Lewis Mumford, The City in History San Diego, Harcourt Inc, 1961; p. XI Style Mumford's florid writing style is also \\"organic\\" compared to the cold, mechanical style of many history texts. Stylistically, his works are full of metaphors and similes, as well as quotations from famous novelists, giving his prose shades of poetry. He refers to such texts as Great Expectations and Hard Times, sometimes using citations to illustrate to the reader what life was like during the industrial era and the city in which Dickens lived. Articles have been written on Mumford's use of metaphors and how his works can often be read as \\"fiction,\\" in the sense that they have narrative flow. That is evident in this book, in which, instead of a human protagonist on which the story centers, we have the city and its growth in a quasi-bildungsroman fashion.

It is based on his earlier game Wallenstein, but it is set in the Sengoku period, which ends with the inception of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Background Japan during the Sengoku or ‚ÄúWarring States‚Äù Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes shogun and wins the game. Equipment =Main game board= People playing Shogun The main game board is printed on both sides, one being printed with a sun symbol and the other with a moon symbol. Each side displays 5 regions. These 5 regions each contain 9 internal provinces. These configurations differ on either side of the board. =Cards= Shogun contains 6 different types of cards: * Province Cards: For each province on the main game board there is a corresponding province card. If the province is shown on both sides, there will be two province cards; One with a sun symbol and one with a moon symbol indicating which side of the game board it corresponds to. * War Chest Cards: Displaying war chests with values (0-4). * Special Cards: This card grants the owner a unique ability. Every Player receives one and only one. * Action Cards: Determine the order in which game events take place. * Event Cards: Display random events that affect all players. * Daimyo Cards: Used to show player turn order. =Others= * Cubes: Shogun uses colored Cubes to represent armies. There are 310 Cubes in 5 colors (Black, Red, Yellow, Purple and Blue), so that each color has 62 Cubes. There are also plus 20 Green Cubes to represent neutral farmer armies. * War Chests: 35 wood-colored chest with a value of 1, and 20 orange-colored chests with a value of 5. * Building Tiles: 28 castles, 26 temples, and 26 Theatres.

While classed with binding knots, such as the reef knot and miller's knot, the bottle sling is able to perform a function for which most other binding knots are unsuited. The bottle sling's specific form allows it to grip a cylinder, assuming it has even a slight flare or collar, and lift it along its axis when the knot is loaded by all four strands. With appropriate size cord, most wine bottles can be reliably suspended with this knot. History The bottle sling was described in detail by the Greek physician Heraklas in his first century monograph on surgical knots and slings. It was included under the name diplous karkhesios brokhos (\\"double jug-sling noose\\"). Clearly familiar with the knot, Heraklas provided three distinct tying methods. Knot expert Cyrus L. Day believed the bottle sling was not described again in print until Craigin's 1884 A Boy's Workshop,Day(1967), p. 88 although Clifford Ashley noted it was illustrated in Johann R√∂ding's 1795 Allgemeines W√∂rterbuch der Marine. More recently, the Bottle Sling has been nationally recognized by the Boy Scouts of America as the symbol of Outdoor Skills by scout camps throughout the country. Usage fiador with the doubled \\"hackamore knot\\" at the bottom As the name suggests, the primary use for this knot is to suspend bottles, jugs, and other items with similar shapes. The space at the center of the knot is dropped over the top of a bottle or similar object. Firmly pulling on all four ends emerging from the knot tightens it against the neck of the bottle. Looping the running ends through the bight and tying them together will make a sling that grips and can be used to lift the bottle. This provides a convenient method of lowering a beverage bottle from a boat into the water to chill. As mentioned above, the knot is believed to have been used medically in ancient Greece for applying traction in the reduction of fractures and dislocations. However it is not known to have any current medical application. The knot is also said to have been used as an improvised emergency bridle when rope was the only material at hand. Its use is described with the central parts of the knot acting as a bit, one of the knot's outer bights passing over the top of the animal's muzzle, and the other passing under the jaw to form the noseband. The closed loop end of the knot would be placed over the animal's head and behind the ears, as a crownpiece, and the two free ends coming off under the chin used as reins. It was intended only for temporary use. As collected in Documents of the Assembly of the State of New York, 136th Session, 1913, Vol. 19, No. 29, Part 5. However at least one author has disputed this as \\"nonsense\\" and suggests its only proper equestrian use is in a doubled form, in this context known as a hackamore knot, to secure the fiador to the bosal in some hackamore designs. Tying Perhaps not surprisingly‚Äîgiven three were already known to the ancient Greeks‚Äîthere are many methods to tie the bottle sling. Swedish physiologist and knot researcher Hjalmar √ñhrvall listed eight in his 1916 book Om Knutar. One method for tying the bottle sling is similar to the loop-and-weave method used to tie the jury mast knot and the trumpet knot. The knot is begun by making a bight in a piece of rope and folding the bight back on itself to make two separated loops that are mirror images of each other. Lay one loop on top of the other so that they overlap slightly and create a cat's eye shaped hole above a triangular shaped hole between the two loops. Make a bird's beak with your index and thumb and weave them down through the loop, up through the cat's eye and down through the bottom loop, bunching the coils of rope against your fingers. Pinch the section of rope that was the bottom of the triangle and flip the coils over the pinched section. The flip may take a little practice, but the pinched section should become a short bight hanging off a circular shaped knot.

It is found along the shores of the northern Pacific Ocean from Central California to Alaska, across the Aleutian Islands to the Kamchatka Peninsula and south to Japan. It inhabits the lower intertidal and subtidal zones of rocky coastlines. Chitons are molluscs which have eight armored plates (called valves) running in a flexible line down their back. Unlike most chitons, the gumboot's valves are completely hidden by its leathery upper skin or girdle, which is usually reddish-brown, brown, and occasionally orange in color. The gumboot chiton's appearance has led some tidepoolers to fondly refer to it as the \\"wandering meatloaf\\". Chitons have long arrays of fine teeth which are partially made of magnetite, making its teeth hard enough to scrape algae off of rocks.https://phys.org/news/2019-02-magnetic-teeth-materials-energy.html  Names  The name \\"gumboot chiton\\" seems to derive from a resemblance to part of a rubber Wellington boot or \\"gum rubber\\" boot. The Latin name Cryptochiton stelleri means Steller's hidden chiton. \\"Steller\\" is in honor of the 18th- century German zoologist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described many species of the northern Pacific seashore. \\"Hidden\\" or \\"concealed\\" refers to the fact that the eight shelly plates characteristic of chitons are not visible, being totally internal in this genus of chiton. Many taxonomic names for chitons are based on the appearance of their plates or valves, and so it is most likely that the \\"hidden\\" portion of the name refers to the valves being completely obscured by the gumboot's girdle.  Life  The underside of a live Cryptochiton stelleri, showing the foot, in the center, surrounded by the gills and mantle. The mouth is visible above and to the left of the foot. The gumboot chiton's underside is orange or yellow and consists mostly of a large foot similar to that of other molluscs like snails or slugs, with gills found in grooves running along the outer edge of the foot. The gumboot chiton is found clinging to rocks, moving slowly in search of its diet of algae, scraped off of rocks with its rasp-like retractable radula, covered with rows of magnetite-tipped teeth. It also eats other marine vegetation such as sea lettuce and giant kelp. A nocturnal creature, the gumboot generally feeds at night and often remains in a hiding place during the day‚Äîalthough on foggy days it may be found exposed in tide pools or on rocks. The gumboot can live for over 40 years. It has few natural predators, the most common being the lurid rocksnail, Ocenebra lurida‚Äîalthough the small snail's efforts to consume the chiton are generally limited to the outer mantle only. It is sometimes reported that the lurid rocksnail is in fact the gumboot chiton's only predator, but others list such animals as the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, some octopus species, and the sea otter. Several other animal species have been observed living within the gumboot's gills; the relationship is thought to be commensal: neither harmful nor helpful to the chiton. One researcher found that more than a quarter of gumboots hosted an Arctonoe vittata, a pale yellow scale worm which can grow up to length. Opisthopus transversus, a small crab, is also sometimes found within the gills.  Human interaction  Hermit crabs and live Tegula funebralis snails on a dead gumboot chiton, Cryptochiton stelleri, in a tide pool at low tide in central California Its flesh is edible, and has been used as a food source by Native Americans, as well as by Russian settlers in Southeast Alaska. However, it is not generally considered palatable, with a texture described as extremely tough and rubbery. The writers of Between Pacific Tides further detail the culinary drawbacks of the gumboot: \\"After one experiment the writers decided to reserve the animals for times of famine; one tough, paper-thin steak was all that could be obtained from a large cryptochiton, and it radiated such a penetrating fishy odor that it was discarded before it reached the frying pan.\\" The gumboot chiton's bony armoring plates, called \\"butterfly shells\\" due to their shape, can sometimes be found washed up on beaches, as can whole chitons: the gumboot keeps a weaker grip on the rocks that make up its home than most chitons do, and therefore it is not unusual for them to be knocked loose in heavy waves.

This office of the Nazi Party Security Service (SD) was responsible for, among other things, falsifying passports and documents. Within the setting of Operation Bernhard, the SD forged pound notes in great numbers, funding Nazi Germany with ‚Ç§600 million in high-quality counterfeit currency (worth approx. $6 billion 2009). This counterfeiting operation was named after Kr√ºger, who led the operation from a segregated factory built at Sachsenhausen concentration camp, manned by 142 Jewish inmates. The pound counterfeiting operation ended in 1944. However Kr√ºger succeeded in establishing a new operation to forge American dollar notes. In May 1945 his team of prisoners were transferred to Ebensee concentration camp in Austria where they were liberated. One of the forgers, Adolf Burger survived the war and stated that \\"Major Kr√ºger was in no way like Oskar Schindler. He was a murderer just like everyone else, six weeks before the war ended he had six people shot just because they were sick. He couldn't send them to hospital in case they said something about the operation, so he killed them.\\" After the war, Major Kr√ºger was detained by the British for two years, then turned over to the French for a year forging documents for them. He was released in 1948 without any charges being pressed, and returned to Germany. In the 1950s, he went before a denazification court, where inmates under his charge at Sachsenhausen provided statements that resulted in his acquittal.

It is also India's first fully indigenously constructed nuclear power station, with two units each generating 220 MW of electricity. The first and second units of the station went critical in 1983 and 1985, respectively. The station has reactors housed in a reactor building with double shell containment improving protection also in the case of a loss-of-coolant accident. An Interim Storage Facility (ISF) is also located in Kalpakkam.  History  During its construction, a total of 3.8 lakh (380,000) railway sleeper (logs) were brought from all over India to lift the 180 ton critical equipment in the first unit, due to lack of proper infrastructure and handling equipment. the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) was in its final construction stage, and was expected to reach criticality in March 2017 with 500 MW of electricity production. The following month the loading of the 1750 ton liquid sodium coolant were expected to happen in four to five months, with sources in the Department of Atomic Energy reporting that criticality would likely be reached only around May 2017.  Reactors  The facility houses two indigenously built Pressurised Heavy-Water Reactors (PHWRs), MAPS-1 and MAPS-2 designed to produce 235 MW of electricity each. MAPS-1 was completed in 1981, but start-up was delayed due to a shortage of heavy water. After procuring the necessary heavy water, MAPS-1 went critical in 1983 and began operating at full power on 27 January 1984. MAPS-2 obtained criticality in 1985 and began full power operations on 21 March 1986.Plants Under Operation - Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited . Npcil.nic.in. Retrieved on 2013-12-06. With India not being a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the reactors have since 1985 been delivering their spent fuel to the nuclear reprocessing plant at Tarapur, providing the country with unsafeguarded plutonium. A beachhead at Kalpakkam also hosts India's first indigenous Pressurised (light) water reactor (PWR). The 80 MW reactor was developed by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) as the land-based prototype of the nuclear power unit for India's nuclear submarines. This unit does not come under MAPS.  Incidents  The reactors' coolant pipes have been plagued by vibrations and cracking with substantial cracking in the reactor coolant system. This cracking has led to the discovery of Zircaloy pieces in a moderator pump, requiring the power generation to be lowered to 170 MW.

With its similar white fortress-like buildings and menu it is considered to be an imitator of White Castle chain that was founded in 1921. The chain was successful and expanded to other cities, including Chicago, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York City, Albany, Boston, Richmond, Virginia, and as far south as Sarasota, Florida. During the Great Depression, White Tower sold hamburgers for five cents. The whiteness of the restaurant was meant among other things to evoke the notion of hygienic conditions, and the chain had staff dressed as nurses, dubbed the \\"Towerettes,\\" to help make this argument.As Hamburgers Go, So Goes America? The Economist, Aug 21st 1997 At its peak in the 1950s there were 230 White Tower locations. The chain began a slow decline. The last location, in Toledo, Ohio, is still open and operational. History John E. Saxe and Thomas E. Saxe started White Tower Hamburgers after investigating various White Castle locations, observing operations and hiring a White Castle operator. The first location opened near Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By the end of 1927, there were six locations in Milwaukee and Racine, Wisconsin. In 1929, White Tower put 30 locations in Detroit alone. Despite the Depression, White Tower expanded to 130 locations. White Tower placed many of its restaurants near train and trolley stops. =Lawsuit= Former White Tower restaurant in Albany, New York In 1929, White Castle sued White Tower in Minnesota for unfair competition and White Tower counter-sued in Michigan as White Tower had arrived in Michigan first. The Minnesota case ended in 1930 in favor of White Castle, forcing White Tower to end its use of similar building designs, slogans and name along with a $82,000 judgment. The Michigan case dragged on until 1934, revealing the hiring away of a White Castle location operator and photographing of the latest White Castle to keep up on design. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later affirmed the lower court's rulings that they had copied White Castle deliberately.White Tower System Inc. v. White Castle System of Eating Houses Corp., 1937 White Castle refrained from forcing a name change for White Tower but did require new locations to pay a royalty fee, and to send photos of the locations. Having to change its look, White Tower first used an art deco, then modernistic designs. Territorially, White Tower and White Castle stayed away from each other from then on. =Peak and decline= Former White Tower restaurant in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania In 1941, White Tower Management Corporation moved its headquarters to Six Suburban Ave., Stamford, Connecticut. At its peak in the mid-1950s, the chain had 230 stores in several states. It tested the \\"Tower-O-Matic\\" automated restaurant in the 1950s and 60s with little success. It also attempted a sit-down restaurant called Marbett's. Many later suburban White Tower restaurants featured curb service with car hops. Brock Saxe took over as president of White Tower Management Corporation in 1970 from his father, T. E. Saxe, when he retired. Brock changed the name of White Tower Corporation to Tombrock Corporation on the corporation's 50th anniversary as it also owns a chain of steakhouses called Brock's. With the migration of people to the suburbs and most of the White Tower locations in the city, by 1979 only 80 Tombrock Corporation-owned locations remained. Tombrock Corporation branched out into franchising Burger Kings and Golden Skillet Chicken. Today, Tombrock Corporation, having exited the restaurant business as an operator, is a real estate investment and management company based in New Canaan, Connecticut.History of Tombrock The last White Tower Restaurant is located at 1515 West Sylvania Avenue in Toledo, Ohio.

It was constructed in 1966 to bypass the Chain of Rocks Bridge immediately to the south. It originally carried traffic for Bypass US 66 and currently carries traffic for Interstate 270. The bridge opened to traffic on September 2, 1966. The original Chain of Rocks Bridge was a narrow bridge with a 22 degree bend midway over the river. Reportedly, two tractor- trailers could not pass each other on that bridge. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) marks Historic Route 66 over the New Chain of Rocks Bridge (with a \\"Spur historic route\\" to the original), but it is only considered a way to make the route continuous. History In 1959, proposals first surfaced of a new bridge just to the north of the existing bridge at Chain of Rocks. One of the major opponents to the proposal was Madison mayor Stephen Maeras, as his city owned the existing Chain of Rocks Bridge that was a toll bridge. The proposed 21 feet above the 1844 high-water mark also brought opponents asking the Corps of Engineers to reject the application. The construction was riddled by various labor and political problems. A death threat to kill a construction supervisor surfaced in July 1965, and by November 1965 the contractor stopped work on the bridge due to the \\"many troubles\\". Meanwhile, as the rest of I-270 was open by then, the City of Madison continued to collect toll revenue from the old bridge, averaging $50,000 to $60,000 per month. The state of Missouri, which was overseeing the construction project, would soon start an investigation as the project was several months behind schedule. The state decided on legal action against the City of Madison in regards to tolls on the old bridge by July 1966, and Madison suspended the tolls on August 2, 1966. On September 2, 1966 at 1:45 PM (13:45), the bridge was opened to traffic. This moment marked the completion of I-270 in St. Louis (not counting the section that was still marked I-244), and was the first of three interstate highway bridges opened in the St. Louis area. This opening could not come at a better time for the people in the nearby Alton area, as they were dealing a narrow bridge of their own at the time that had numerous problems and was facing another major closure due to repairs. As a result, any construction work or major accident on either bridge almost always made the Alton Telegraph (with the biggest stories making front page). In 1975, the Clark Bridge closed for major repairs for a six-month period, and traffic was detoured onto this bridge. Many locals refer to it as the I-270 Bridge, to differentiate it from the original Chain of Rocks Bridge, which still stands but is closed to vehicle traffic. As the truck traffic from the I-70 corridor increased (I-70 thru truckers preferred the I-270 routing through St. Louis due to lower congestion and shorter distances), the Alton area used the 1975 detour as a rallying point in getting the Clark Bridge replaced. Although planning work was being done, there was no funding for that replacement. Meanwhile, the truck traffic was taking a toll on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over both the Mississippi River and Chain of Rocks Canal. Lane restrictions for expansion joint and pavement repairs on both structures was common during the 1980s and 1990s. The river bridge would soon be rated structurally deficient by 1991. In 1993, the Mississippi River experienced major flooding during the Great Flood of 1993. North of St. Louis, all bridges from the McKinley Bridge up to the Keokuk Bridge were shut down due to flooding at one point or another. The I-270 bridge, despite having lower than normal clearance over the Mississippi River, remained open. The majority of the other bridges that were closed had flooded approaches, however, all of the approaches on I-270 were built on high ground and remained above water. This led to some of the worst traffic delays on the bridge during this time, especially during peak periods at the height of the floods. On January 4, 1994, the Clark Bridge opened to traffic, giving the Chain of Rocks Bridge much needed relief. During the night of August 10, 1994, two pins supporting an expansion joint failed and caused a section on the Illinois end of the bridge to sink nearly 4 inches, causing 3 of the 4 lanes to close for emergency repairs. For the remainder of that month, various lanes would close due to emergency repairs and inspections and news regarding the emergency repairs frequently made headlines in the Alton Telegraph. From June 1996 through December 1998, IDOT conducted a major bridge resurfacing project on both the river and canal bridges, with various expansion joints being replaced during this time. IDOT put an 8-6 width and legal weight restriction on the bridge, which forced the majority of trucks to take alternate routes during this time. Traffic would often clog during Friday afternoons while the construction went on. The weight and width restrictions would be lifted after the project concluded. As traffic demands continue to increase, the lack of shoulders on both the canal and river bridges is starting to prove a safety hazard. The canal bridge would receive a functionally obsolete rating. In addition, with the bridge still being at 4 lanes of traffic, any issue that occurs can cause big problems. On December 8, 2010, a major tractor-trailer accident would close the bridge for 10 hours and paralyze traffic in the Metro-East during the morning peak periods. I-270 canal bridges used 1966‚Äì2014; imploded 2015 Notes * Until 1994, locals heavily used this crossing due to the constant problems of the Old Clark Bridge. * On August 10, 1994, a broken beam caused the closure of 3 of the 4 lanes on the bridge for a few days. The lanes were reopened on August 14, 1994. * In the near future, IDOT wants to replace this span as a part of widening I-270 from 4 lanes to 6 lanes from I-255 to Lilac.Transportation Infrastructure Proposals * The nearby Canal Bridges were replaced in the middle of 2014 after a nearly three- year-long construction project.

A territorial abbey (or territorial abbacy) is a particular church of the Catholic Church comprising defined territory which is not part of a diocese but surrounds an abbey or monastery whose abbot or superior functions as ordinary for all Catholics and parishes in the territory. Such an abbot is called a territorial abbot or abbot nullius di≈ìceseos (abbreviated abbot nullius and Latin for \\"abbot of no diocese\\"). A territorial abbot thus differs from an ordinary abbot, who exercises authority only within the monastery's walls or to monks or canons who have taken their vows there. A territorial abbot is equivalent to a diocesan bishop in Catholic canon law. While most belong to the Latin Church, and usually to the Benedictine or Cistercian Orders, there are Eastern Catholic territorial abbeys ‚Äî most notably the Italo-Greek Abbey of Grottaferrata. History Though territorial (like other) abbots are elected by the monks of their abbey, a territorial abbot can only receive the abbatial blessing and be installed under mandate from the pope, just as a bishop cannot be ordained and installed as ordinary of a diocese without such a mandate. After the Second Vatican Council, more emphasis has been placed on the unique nature of the episcopacy and on the traditional organization of the church into dioceses under bishops. As such, abbeys nullius have been phased out in favor of the erection of new dioceses or the absorption of the territory into an existing diocese. A few ancient abbeys nullius still exist in Europe, and one in Korea. Present territorial abbeys There are eleven remaining territorial abbeys, as listed by the Vatican in the Annuario Pontificio: ; Italy * Monte Cassino (lost most territory to the Diocese of Sora-Aquino- Pontecorvo) ; Korea * T≈èkwon (ÎçïÏõê), North Korea ** Ecclesiastically united with South Korea, T≈èkwon (the only territorial abbey outside Europe) has been vacant for many years. The Abbot of Waegwan is the present apostolic administrator of the T≈èkwon abbacy. It has not been united with any diocese throughout Korea due to the effective vacancy of the ones in North Korea and the lack of effective jurisdiction applied by the Church in South Korea.  Other historical territorial abbacies  Historically there have been more, such as : ; Americas * in North America : ** Belmont Abbey ‚Äì Mary, Help of Christians, which was the territorial abbey of half of North Carolina from 1910 until 1960, when it lost its last extra-abbatial territory.

Passengers atop Mount McClellan in 1910. The Argentine Central Railway was a narrow gauge railroad in the United States built from the Colorado and Southern Railway at Silver Plume, Colorado, to Waldorf, Colorado, (now a ghost town) and onward to the summit of Mount McClellan. Construction began on August 1, 1905, and the line was opened to Waldorf a year later on August 1, 1906, a distance of about 6 miles. It was financed and organised by Edward J. Wilcox, owner of 65 mining properties in the Argentine region that were consolidated into the Waldorf Mining and Milling Company in 1902. His headquarters at Waldorf was accessible only by pack mule for much of the year.Development and Transportation Tunnel Enterprises in the Argentine District, Colorado, Mining Reporter, Vol. LIV, No. 23 (Dec 6, 1906); pages 570-573. As well as serving the silver mining operations of the region, the railroad was also intended for the tourist trade, ascending http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=5661 Mount McClellan and intending to reach the summit of 14,270 ft (4,350 m) Grays Peak nearby. It was believed at the time that Mount McClellan was high, but this was later disproved. It remains the highest altitude reached by a regular adhesion railway (as opposed to a rack railway) in the United States.F. B. Hinman, The Highest Regular Railroad in the World Operated for General Traffic, The Railroad Trainman, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 3 (March 1911); pages 192-196, includes 3 photographs. The line was steeply graded and sharply curved, with a standard of 6% grade maximum and 32¬∞ minimum curvature (); even so, it required six switchbacks on the ascent. Due to these grades, geared steam locomotives were used exclusively, the railroad rostering a total of seven two-truck Shay locomotives. As well as ascending to Argentine Pass and Grays Peak, Wilcox purchased the Vidler Tunnel, a project begun in 1902 to expand an existing silver mine into a railroad tunnel under the pass. The line would have extended onward to Keystone, Colorado, and a junction with the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad. Work on the project stopped in 1911, by which time the tunnel was three-quarters completed. The tunnel project was revived as a highway tunnel in 1952, and the 1.4 mile tunnel was completed as a water diversion tunnel in 1969.T. S. Lovering, Geology and Ore Deposits of the Montezuma Quadrangle, Colorado, Professional Paper 178, United States Geological Survey, 1935; page 111 discusses the Vidler Tunnel.John N. Winchester, A Historical View: Transmountain Development in Colorado , 2000; retrieved July, 2015. The fall of silver prices after the Panic of 1907 ruined Wilcox, causing him to sell the railroad in 1908 for only $44,000, taking an estimated loss of $256,000 on the line. The buyer, David W. Brown of Colorado, planned an expansion in the tourist traffic and revitalised the concept of reaching Grays Peak, but the money was never there. The line went bankrupt and a receiver was appointed on August 3, 1911; it did not operate during 1911 and 1912. The assets of the bankrupt Argentine Central were offered for auction in a Sheriff's sale on May 29, 1912.Clear Creek County, The Mining News, Engineering and Mining Journal, Vol. 93, No. 21 (May 25, 1912); page 1054. The sale netted just $5,000, a price so low that the district court ordered a resale.Railway and Financial News, Railway Age Gazette, Vol. 53, No. 2 (July 12, 1912); page 82. The second sale, on June 2, raised $20,000, but this too was set aside; the final sale, to William Rogers on Aug. 19, was for $20,002.Railway and Financial News, Railway Age Gazette, Vol. 53, No. 10 (Sept. 6, 1912); page 454. Arguments about whether the rolling stock of the railroad was properly included in the sale led to a lawsuit that was resolved in the Colorado Supreme Court in 1915.Booth v. Central Bank, No. 7720, Jan. 1915, Supreme Court of Colorado, Vol. 58, W.H. Courtright, 1915; pages 519-533. A consortium of local business interests led by William Rogers reorganized it as the Georgetown and Gray's Peak Railway leased to and operated by the Argentine and Gray's Peak Railway Company.Georgetown and Gray's Peak Ry., Poor's Manual of Railroads of the United States, Poors Railroad Manual Co., 1915; pages 1362, 1988. At this point, the line had 3 locomotives and 16 freight cars. While the new owners were mostly interested in freight traffic, the tourist business brought in sufficient money that it was resumed for the 1913 summer season. Rogers transferred the controlling interest in the line for the next season to his associate, egg producer Fred W. Blankenbuhler. Blankenbuhler replaced the Shay locomotives and most of the freight cars with 40-passenger gasoline-powered railcars for the 1916 season.Railroad Notes -- The Argentine and Gray's Peak Ry., Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way, Vol. XI (New Series), No. 8 (Aug. 1915), page 261.Gasoline Railroad Cars Used on Mountain Line, Popular Mechanics, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Oct. 1917); page 502, includes photo of cars at summit. Some of the last freight hauled over the 9-miles from Silver Plume to Waldorf was 100,000 pounds (50 tons) of telephone poles, wire, insulators and supplies for Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph in the summer of 1917. This was for the Argentine Pass segment of a long-distance telephone line from Denver to Leadville. Because the railroad was exclusively a tourist line at this time, all freight had to be hauled at night or early in the morning. The freight charge for this load of telephone supplies was $500, or $1.11 per ton- mile.Philip H. Dexter, The Denver-Leadville Toll Line Via Argentine Pass, the Mountain States Monitor, Nov. 1917; page 2, with many illustrations. In contrast, the average freight rate in the United States in 1915 was under $0.008 per ton-mile.Slason Thompson, Statistics of American Railways, Section VII: Public Service of the Railways, The Railway Library 1915, Stromberg, Allen & Co, Chicago, 1916; pages 313-456, see table of Receipts per Ton Mile on Page 404. Despite the costs saved by the switch to self-propelled railcars, the railroad was not profitable without the regular freight traffic it had previously carried. Notice to abandon was posted on October 24, 1918, and approved on November 9; the tracks were removed in the summer of 1919.Industrial News, Engineering and Mining Journal, Vol. 108, No. 16 (Oct. 18, 1919); pages 663-664.

It was founded on September 15, 1965, at the request of a group of Roman Catholic families who appealed to the Salvadoran government and the Society of Jesus in order to create another university as an alternative to the University of El Salvador, becoming the first private institution of higher education in the country. The Jesuits also run Central American University in Nicaragua (UCA Managua), opened in 1960. History UCA has since evolved to be one of the best institutions of higher learning in Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama).Webometrics. \\"Ranking of World Universities\\". July 2010. This is the case, despite the university's focus on playing a decisive role in the transformation of the unjust Salvadoran society. Such a focus within the Salvadoran context has driven the university to give priority to undergraduate degrees, research within the social sciences, and popular presentation of research results (\\"social projectionl\\") in local peer-reviewed journals. In the 1970s and 1980s, during the Civil War in El Salvador, UCA was known as the home of several internationally recognized Jesuit scholars and intellectuals, including Jon Sobrino, Ignacio Ellacur√≠a, Ignacio Mart√≠n-Bar√≥, and Segundo Montes. They were outspoken against the abuses of the Salvadoran military and government, and carried out research to demonstrate the effects of the war and poverty in the country. The extreme social conditions in El Salvador provided a very rich empirical basis for innovative research within sociology, social anthropology, philosophy, social psychology, and theology. These scholars made important and lasting contributions within these fields. Ellacur√≠a, Mart√≠n-Bar√≥ and Segundo Montes, along with three other Jesuit professors, their housekeeper, and her daughter, were murdered by the Salvadoran Armed forces on November 16, 1989, in one of the most notorious episodes from the Civil War (see Murder of UCA scholars). Campus The university is located at Antiguo Cuscatl√°n. The university campus has 38 acres (16 ha) with 33 buildings, a professional soccer field, basketball and volleyball courts, as well as three auditoriums and four cafeterias. The campus also includes a minimarket, a museum, three clinics, a book shop, a main library, several smaller thematic libraries, and a documentation center. =Faculties= * Faculty of Economics and Business Sciences * Faculty of Human and Social Sciences * Faculty of Engineering and Architecture =Academic departments= * Department of Mathematics * Department of Business Administration * Department of Judicial Sciences * Department of Sociology and Political Science * Department of Economics * Department of Accounting and Finance * Department of Psychology * Department of Philosophy * Department of Theology * Department of Educational Sciences * Department of Communications and Culture * Department of Public Health * Department of Operations and Systems * Department of Electronics and Informatics * Department of Energy and Fluid Sciences * Department of Structural Mechanics * Department of Spatial Organization * Department of Engineering Process and Environmental Science =Social projection= * UCA Audiovisuals * YSUCA 91.7 FM Radio * Monse√±or Romero Center * University's Public Opinion Institute - IUDOP * University's Human Rights Institute - IDHUCA Academics =Undergraduate programs= * Architecture * Civil Engineering * Electrical Engineering * Mechanical Engineering * Industrial Engineering * Chemical Engineering * Food Engineering * Energetic Engineering * Computing Engineering * Technician in Marketing * Technician in Accounting * Licenciate in Philosophy * Licenciate in Theology * Licenciate in Psychology * Licenciate in Economics * Licenciate in Marketing * Licenciate in Public Accounting * Licenciate in Business Administration * Licenciate in Agribusiness Administration * Licenciate in Judicial Sciences * Licenciate in Social Communications * Professorate of Theology * Professorate of Special Education * Professorate of Preschool Education * Professorate of Basic Education (1st & 2nd Cycles) * Professorate of English Language (3rd Cycle Basic and Middle Education) =Postgraduate programs= * Master in Iberoamerican Philosophy * Master in Social Sciences * Master in Political Sciences * Master in Latin American Theology * Master in Local Development * Master in Criminal Constitutional Law * Master in Applied Statistics to Investigation * Master in Environmental Management * Master in Industrial Maintenance Management * Master in Public Health * Master in Communitarian Psychology * Master in Educational Evaluation and Politics * Master in Communications * Master in Finance * Master in Financial Audit * Master in Business Law * Master in Business Administration * Doctorate in Iberoamerican Philosophy * Doctorate in Social SciencesGraduate See also * Education in El Salvador * List of universities in El Salvador * Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as References *Official website Universities in El Salvador Jesuit universities and colleges Educational institutions established in 1965 San Salvador 1965 establishments in El Salvador ","title":"Central American University"},{"id":"4022674","text":"Dr George Musgrave (1921 - 9 February 2006) was an elder of the Kuku Thaypan clan and a famous Australian bush tracker. He was an Agu Alaya speaker. He was born in his own country, near Lakefield National Park. As children, he and Tommy George Senior were hidden in mailbags by the station owner, Fredrick Sheppard, to avoid removal by police and welfare officers. As a result, they were able to grow up with their own people, and learn traditional law and language, management practices of their country and how to live off the land. Recently, they were able to successfully claim continuous ownership of traditional lands, and retain custody of some land at Gno-Coom (Saxby Waterhole). George's senses were so sharp he could follow a week-old trail through dense scrub at night. He could identify tracks that were up to two months old. In August 2005 he was asked to track an off duty policeman who had become lost while pig hunting. Despite being 84 years old, he found the man in less than a day. He also worked as a community policeman and musterer. Together with Tommy George Senior, he founded the Ang-Gnarra Aboriginal Corporation at Laura, Queensland, the biennial Laura Festival of Traditional Dance and Culture, the Traditional Knowledge Recording Project and the Cape York Land Council. They campaigned to protect the world-renowned Quinkan rock art near Laura, where they carried out custodial duties for special places, including the rock art galleries. They shared their knowledge of the bush, their language and their customs with researchers and visitors. It would be difficult to find a piece of scholarly work on traditional language, culture or country in Cape York Peninsula that does not credit their expertise. In 2005 he and Tommy George were each awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by James Cook University for their knowledge of traditional Aboriginal Law.  Publications  * George, T., & G.

Mark Izen founded the company in 1995; its online presence first appeared early in 2000. Based officially in Boston, Massachusetts, at its peak First Act maintained offices in Bentonville, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, and a \\"custom shop\\" luthiery in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 2016, First Act was acquired by toy manufacturer Jazwares.  Founding management team  First Act was largely an unrelated result of the successful sale of Duracraft (a supplier of \\"home-comfort appliances\\" such as fans, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners to large discount retail chains) to the Consumer Products division of Honeywell in 1996. This lineage is clear in the resulting First Act leadership, where rather than having any dedicated musicians among them, they would rely on their experience with generic commodity-level small appliances. *Bernard Chiu, Chairman of the Board ‚Äî previously co-founder (with Tim Chen and Ronald Izen) and CEO of Duracraft, as well as President and Chairman *Ronald Izen, Vice Chairman of the Board ‚Äî previously Executive Vice President of Sales for Duracraft, from its founding in 1989 through 1998 *Mark Izen, President and CEO ‚Äî \\"Prior to starting First Act Inc. in 1995, Mark founded CMI Enterprises, Inc., a manufacturer‚Äôs representative firm that sold multiple, high-profile consumer products lines to national and regional retailers.\\" *Mary Hassan, Vice President, Human Resources ‚Äî former Vice President of Human Resources for Duracraft and then Honeywell Consumer Products, and Director of Staffing and Employee Relations for Reebok International. *Tony Natale, Vice President, Finance and Operations ‚Äî eleven years at Duracraft then Honeywell in various financial and operational positions, including Director of Materials Management and Assistant Controller.  Product lines  The company's products are divided into two lines, with very similar entries but sold toward different audiences. They are marketed through large retail chains, particularly Toys \\"R\\" Us and Target, as well as Amazon.com. First Act proper is shaped toward inexpensive \\"beginner\\" instruments intended for children and adults. The small range is primarily a basic three-piece drum kit, a soprano ukulele, three dynamic-type microphones, and five guitars, both full-size (acoustic and electric) and short-scale (marketed both as \\"sized for kids\\" and as a travel guitar). Paralleling this line is First Act Discovery (sometimes just Discovery), musical products for children ages 3 to 9, which has seen acoustic guitars, ukuleles, drums, electronic percussion pads, tambourines, recorders, keyboards, and electronic button-controlled \\"guitars.\\" The line also had a series of plastic microphone-like products, largely with sounds and graphics licensed from Disney, including Nickelodeon, DreamWorks, and Marvel properties. More recently, to maximize the ukulele fad, a series of Disney- graphic instruments (albeit marketed as \\"mini guitars\\") has been released, such as the AV285 Avengers uke. An ambitious series of projects and products has been eliminated since First Act's 2012 peak. *First Act Instruments ‚Äî the original retail line of entry-level instruments for teens and adults, including guitars, drums, hand percussion, and accessories. *Mark II ‚Äî intended in First Act's early years to become the quality line. The name isn't mentioned after 2003. *Concert Series ‚Äî a range of inexpensive band instruments marketed to grade-school students. *222 ‚Äî in 2008, First Act partnered with Adam Levine (lead vocalist and guitarist of Maroon 5) to produce 222 by First Act, a line of 22 music products, including an acoustic guitar and a \\"signature\\" model of electric guitar designed by Levine, branded \\"222\\" (his lucky number).http://www.top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=43289 The line was sold through Target stores.http://www.target.com/gp/search/602-8421271-7347009?ie=UTF8&index;=target&field- browse;=1038576&ref;=sr_bx_1_1&field-keywords;=first%20act%20222 *Fuel ‚Äî successor to First Act Instruments, intended to distance this chain store presence (largely Walmart and Target) from the company's expanding quality lines. *Studio For Artists (SFA) ‚Äî designed and built custom guitars and violins for professional musicians. Each instrument was handcrafted, and finished in First Act's Boston studio. *SFA Edition Guitars ‚Äî standard First Act guitars with added custom appointments, such as premium pickups, upgraded machine heads, and unique pickguards. *Limited Edition Guitars ‚Äî three Limited Edition models were created in the SFA facility: the \\"Lola\\", \\"Sheena\\", and \\"Delia.\\" Guitar Player magazine praised the instruments for their stylistic innovation, unique appearance and excellent workmanship. Related facilities First Act Guitar Studio was a real-world storefront at 745 Boylston Street, Boston, offering various First Act Custom, Limited Edition, SFA Edition, and First Act series electric and acoustic guitars, and accessories. Customers could play the guitars, watch a luthier crafting custom guitars, see a live show, or have their guitar serviced. Endorsers and users In 2011, the First Act website claimed endorsements from 136 guitar players, including Brad Whitford (Aerosmith), Rusty Anderson (Paul McCartney), Matt Pike (High on Fire), Lyn-Z (Mindless Self Indulgence), Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher (Mastodon), Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), Al Berry (Avril Lavigne), Nick McCarthy (Franz Ferdinand), Lee Malia (Bring Me The Horizon), Dave Knudson (Minus the Bear), Anders Bj√∂rler (At The Gates), Adam Gardner (Guster), Tim McTague and James Smith (Underoath), and Serj Tankian (System of a Down). Most of them played variations on the three top-line First Act models, the \\"Lola\\", \\"Sheena\\", and \\"Delia.\\" As well, there were the models designed in collaboration with Paul Westerberg and Adam Levine, respectively the PW580 and the 222.  Partnerships and promotions  First Act distributed branded calendars to Guitar Player subscribers in 2006 and 2007. The 2006 edition highlighted Studio for Artists guitars, including custom and limited- edition models. First Act collaborated with two Red Sox players as a charity fund-raiser. Guitars were designed for pitchers Curt Schilling and Jonathan Papelbon after the players sketched their rough ideas, and First Act's design and custom shop teams brought the guitars to life. The customized guitars were auctioned off at a \\"Hot Stove Cool Music\\" concert fund-raiser at Fenway Park. The two guitars raised a total of $12,000 for Theo Epstein's charity. First Act introduced a Paul Westerberg signature guitar, the PW58, featuring a plaid pickguard and a custom body shape designed in the Studio for Artists facility. First Act partnered with automaker Volkswagen for a 2006 promotional campaign to distribute \\"GarageMaster\\" guitars with selected vehicle models through the end of the year. The campaign ran from October 3 through December 31. GarageMaster guitars were available in white, red, and blue to those who purchased a VW. The stereos in these Volkswagens could be used as an amplifier for the guitar. Accompanying advertisements featured guitarists Slash, John Mayer, and Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap playing First Act guitars through the sound systems of Volkswagens. The GarageMaster model featured a battery- powered on-board preamp, knobs decorated with the \\"VW\\" logo, pickguards matching the vehicle's color, a metal plate inscribed with the corresponding vehicle's VIN, and could be plugged directly into the vehicles' audio systems using a minijack cable. Consumer electronics In 2010, a video game division of First Act, Seven45 Studios, released Power Gig: Rise of the SixString. Peripherals included a functional electric guitar with controller buttons, a microphone, and a motion sensor system to simulate drums. Seven45 subsequently produced a number of music-based iOS apps. In 2011 First Act released an iOS app for iPad and iPhone for karaoke under the Disney license called \\"Disney Spotlight Karaoke.\\" It includes sing-a-longs with songs from Disney Channel stars and the ability to record and upload a video. First Act also released a line of Disney-themed microphones designed to work with the app. In 2012 First Act released an iOS app for iPhone and iPad called \\"Notes to Grow On\\" which is a companion educational app for the Discovery line of instruments. In October 2012, First Act launched a line of consumer electronics including charging, music, and audio interfaces for iPods, iPads, and iPhones, under the name BlueFlame Technologies.  Criticism  The company received criticism from music educators who claimed that First Act band instruments, targeted at beginning students, were of low quality, often irreparable, and that replacement parts were difficult to acquire. In 2003, First Act sued the music retailer Brook Mays for false advertising, after the retailer had distributed marketing materials to school band directors which criticized the company's products as \\"instrument-shaped objects,\\" thus encouraging their customers to return them. First Act was awarded $16.7 million to compensate for lost profits, a judgment that effectively bankrupted Brook Mays.

It is a tributary of Tonawanda Creek, which in turn flows into the Niagara River. Course Ellicott Creek originates in southwest corner of Genesee County, just northeast of Darien Lakes State Park, in the Town of Darien. It flows generally west, crossing into Erie County and the Town of Alden. It crosses the northern edge of the Town of Lancaster, flowing through the community of Bowmansville in the northwest part of Lancaster. Continuing west, Ellicott Creek enters the Town of Cheektowaga. There it passes by the toxic Pfohl Brothers Landfill and the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The creek turns to the northwest at the airport. It flows under one of the runways via a tunnel. It then turns more directly north and enters the Village of Williamsville and the Town of Amherst. At Williamsville's Island Park Ellicott Creek splits briefly into two channels, one of which contains floodgates. The other channel was historically used to divert water into flumes for powering mills just downstream. Below the floodgates the creek flows rapidly north, passing under State Route 5 and falling over the Onondaga Escarpment at Glen Falls in Amherst State Park. Town of Tonawanda. After Glen Falls, Ellicott Creek continues flowing generally north and northwest through Amherst.

Living in Florence, he was closely associated with Lorenzo de' Medici, and was music teacher both to the Florentine composer Francesco de Layolle and Guido Machiavelli, the son of the famous writer. Life He was born in Florence, and seems to have spent most of his life there. He was a singer in the cathedral of Santissima Annunziata from 1488, and was appointed as a singer in the baptistry chapel by Lorenzo de' Medici himself. In addition he worked as an organist at several locations in Florence, finally obtaining the position of organist at the cathedral in 1509, a position he retained for the rest of his life. Bartolomeo was well- connected with the artistic and cultural life in Florence. In addition to being part of the circle of Lorenzo de' Medici, his friends included the poet Lorenzo Strozzi, and he was the music teacher of the son of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. He also may have been one of the teachers of Francesco Corteccia, the most prominent Florentine musician of the middle of the 16th century. Some of Bartolomeo's children and grandchildren also became well-known musicians in Florence, including his sons Antonio, Lorenzo, and Piero, and his grandson Baccio degli Organi, a Florentine music teacher in the 16th century. Music and influence Relatively little of Bartolomeo's music has survived. Only fifteen pieces are found in sources of the period: ten secular songs, a lauda, and four instrumental compositions. The songs are in the characteristic style of the popular music of the period, with simple rhythms, homophonic texture, clear phrasing, and they are in strophic form. Eight are ballatas. In spite of his close association with Ss Annunziata, only a single sacred composition has survived, the lauda Sguardate il Salvatore, and that is probably an adaptation of a secular song. Some influence of the Netherlands school is evident in his music: he used the tune of the famous chanson De tous biens plaine by Hayne van Ghizeghem in one of his instrumental pieces, and he also used motivic material by Alexander Agricola (who also worked in Florence in the early 1490s, and was possibly his teacher) in his instrumental music.

Binding of a ligand hormone causes the corepressor to dissociate and a coactivator is recruited. The activator bound coactivator recruits RNA polymerase and other transcription machinery that then begins transcribing the target gene. A coactivator is a type of transcriptional coregulator that binds to an activator (a transcription factor) to increase the rate of transcription of a gene or set of genes. The activator contains a DNA binding domain that binds either to a DNA promoter site or a specific DNA regulatory sequence called an enhancer. Binding of the activator-coactivator complex increases the speed of transcription by recruiting general transcription machinery to the promoter, therefore increasing gene expression. The use of activators and coactivators allows for highly specific expression of certain genes depending on cell type and developmental stage. Some coactivators also have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. HATs form large multiprotein complexes that weaken the association of histones to DNA by acetylating the N-terminal histone tail. This provides more space for the transcription machinery to bind to the promoter, therefore increasing gene expression. Activators are found in all living organisms, but coactivator proteins are typically only found in eukaryotes because they are more complex and require a more intricate mechanism for gene regulation. In eukaryotes, coactivators are usually proteins that are localized in the nucleus.  Mechanism  Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) removes the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA and transfers it the N-terminal tail of chromatin histones. In the reverse reaction, histone deacetylase (HDAC) removes the acetyl group from the histone tails and binds it to coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA. Some coactivators indirectly regulate gene expression by binding to an activator and inducing a conformational change that then allows the activator to bind to the DNA enhancer or promoter sequence. Once the activator-coactivator complex binds to the enhancer, RNA polymerase II and other general transcription machinery are recruited to the DNA and transcription begins. = Histone acetyltransferase = Nuclear DNA is normally wrapped tightly around histones, making it hard or impossible for the transcription machinery to access the DNA. This association is due primarily to the electrostatic attraction between the DNA and histones as the DNA phosphate backbone is negatively charged and histones are rich in lysine residues, which are positively charged. The tight DNA-histone association prevents the transcription of DNA into RNA. Many coactivators have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity meaning that they can acetylate specific lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of histones. In this method, an activator binds to an enhancer site and recruits a HAT complex that then acetylates nucleosomal promoter-bound histones by neutralizing the positively charged lysine residues. This charge neutralization causes the histones to have a weaker bond to the negatively charged DNA, which relaxes the chromatin structure, allowing other transcription factors or transcription machinery to bind to the promoter (transcription initiation). Acetylation by HAT complexes may also help keep chromatin open throughout the process of elongation, increasing the speed of transcription. N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) transfers the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) to the N-terminal amino group of a polypeptide. Acetylation of the N-terminal histone tail is one of the most common protein modifications found in eukaryotes, with about 85% of all human proteins being acetylated. Acetylation is crucial for synthesis, stability, function, regulation and localization of proteins and RNA transcripts. HATs function similarly to N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) but their acetylation is reversible unlike in NATs. HAT mediated histone acetylation is reversed using histone deactetylase (HDAC), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of lysine residues, removing the acetyl group from the histones. This causes the chromatin to close back up from their relaxed state, making it difficult for the transcription machinery to bind to the promoter, thus repressing gene expression. Examples of coactivators that display HAT activity include CARM1, CBP and EP300. = Corepression = Many coactivators also function as corepressors under certain circumstances. Cofactors such as TAF1 and BTAF1 can initiate transcription in the presence of an activator (act as a coactivator) and repress basal transcription in the absence of an activator (act as a corepressor).  Significance  = Biological significance = Transcriptional regulation is one of the most common ways for an organism to alter gene expression. The use of activation and coactivation allows for greater control over when, where and how much of a protein is produced. This enables each cell to be able to quickly respond to environmental or physiological changes and helps to mitigate any damage that may occur if it were otherwise unregulated. = Associated disorders = Mutations to coactivator genes leading to loss or gain of protein function have been linked to diseases and disorders such as birth defects, cancer (especially hormone dependent cancers), neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disability (ID), among many others. Dysregulation leading to the over- or under-expression of coactivators can detrimentally interact with many drugs (especially anti-hormone drugs) and has been implicated in cancer, fertility issues and neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. For a specific example, dysregulation of CREB-binding protein (CBP)‚Äîwhich acts as a coactivator for numerous transcription factors within the central nervous system (CNS), reproductive system, thymus and kidneys‚Äîhas been linked to Huntington's Disease, leukaemia, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, neurodevelopmental disorders and deficits of the immune system, hematopoiesis and skeletal muscle function. = As drug targets = Coactivators are promising targets for drug therapies in the treatment of cancer, metabolic disorder, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, along with many other disorders. For example, the steroid receptor coactivator (SCR) NCOA3 is often overexpressed in breast cancer, so the development of an inhibitor molecule that targets this coactivator and decreases its expression could be used as a potential treatment for breast cancer. Because transcription factors control many different biological processes, they are ideal targets for drug therapy. The coactivators that regulate them can be easily replaced with a synthetic ligand that allows for control over an increase or decrease in gene expression. Further technological advances will provide new insights into the function and regulation of coactivators at a whole-organism level and elucidate their role in human disease, which will hopefully provide better targets for future drug therapies.  Known coactivators  To date there are more than 300 known coregulators. Some examples of these coactivators include: * ARA54 targets androgen receptors * ATXN7L3 targets several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily * BCL3 targets 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR) * CBP targets many transcription factors * CDC25B targets steroid receptors * COPS5 targets several nuclear receptors * DDC targets androgen receptors * EP300 targets many transcription factors * KAT5 targets many nuclear receptors * KDM1A targets androgen receptors * Steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family ** NCOA1 targets several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily ** NCOA2 targets several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily ** NCOA3 targets several nuclear receptors and transcription factors  See also  *Repressor *Regulation of gene expression *Transcription coregulator *Translation *TcoF- DB  References   External links  * Nuclear Receptor Signalling Atlas (NIH-funded research consortium and database; includes open-access PubMed- indexed journal, Nuclear Receptor Signaling) * TcoF - Dragon database of transcription co-factors and transcription factor interacting proteins Gene expression Molecular genetics Proteins Transcription coregulators ","title":"Coactivator (genetics)"},{"id":"4022742","title":"List of Chinese administrative divisions by natural growth rate"},{"id":"4022743","text":"The Air Weapons Complex (AWC) is a scientific research and development military complex engage in explosive engineering, specifically in airborne system.

Gauss, Bernhard Riemann, and Ernst Mach for general relativity. Subsequently, claims have been put forward about both theories, asserting that they were formulated, either wholly or in part, by others before Einstein. At issue is the extent to which Einstein and various other individuals should be credited for the formulation of these theories, based on priority considerations. Background In the history of special relativity, the most important names that are mentioned in discussions about the distribution of credit are Albert Einstein, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincar√©, and Hermann Minkowski. Consideration is also given to numerous other scientists for either anticipations of some aspects of the theory, or else for contributions to the development or elaboration of the theory. These include Woldemar Voigt, August F√∂ppl, Joseph Larmor, Emil Cohn, Friedrich Hasen√∂hrl, Max Planck, Max von Laue, Gilbert Newton Lewis and Richard Chase Tolman, and others. In addition, polemics exist about alleged contributions of others such as Olinto De Pretto who according to some mathematical scholars did not create relativity but was the first to use the equation;On Olinto De Pretto alleged contributions by mathmatical historian, see , The Guardian, 10 November 1999. Also Einstein's first wife Mileva Mariƒá, although her contribution is not considered to have any foundation according to serious scholars.On Mileva Mariƒá's alleged contributions, see The Einstein Controversy, Physics Central, 17 December 2008. In his History of the theories of ether and electricity from 1953, E. T. Whittaker claimed that relativity is the creation of Lorentz and Poincar√© and attributed to Einstein's papers only little importance.Whittaker (1953), pp. 27-77 However, most historians of science, like Gerald Holton, Arthur I. Miller, Abraham Pais, John Stachel, or Olivier Darrigol have other points of view. They admit that Lorentz and Poincar√© developed the mathematics of special relativity, and many scientists originally spoke about the \\"Lorentz- Einstein theory\\". But they argue that it was Einstein who completely eliminated the classical ether and demonstrated the relativity of space and time. They also argue that Poincar√© demonstrated the relativity of space and time only in his philosophical writings, but in his physical papers he maintained the ether as a privileged frame of reference that is perfectly undetectable, and continued (like Lorentz) to distinguish between \\"real\\" lengths and times measured by observers at rest within the aether, and \\"apparent\\" lengths and times measured by observers in motion within the aether. Darrigol summarizes: > Most of the components of Einstein's paper appeared in others' anterior > works on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Poincar√© and Alfred Bucherer > had the relativity principle. Lorentz and Larmor had most of the Lorentz > transformations, Poincar√© had them all. Cohn and Bucherer rejected the > ether.

None of them > derived the Lorentz transformations on this basis. None of them fully > understood the physical implications of these transformations. It all was > Einstein's unique feat. Undisputed facts The following facts are well established and referable: * In 1889, ([Poi89]), Henri Poincar√© argued that the ether might be unobservable, in which case the existence of the ether is a metaphysical question, and he suggested that some day the ether concept would be thrown aside as useless. However, in the same book (Ch. 10) he considered the ether a \\"convenient hypothesis\\" and continued to use the concept also in later books in 1908 ([Poi08], Book 3) and 1912 ([Poi13], Ch. 6). * In 1895, Poincar√© argued that results like those obtained by Michelson and Morley (Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment) show that it seems to be impossible to detect the absolute motion of matter or the relative motion of matter in relation to the ether. In 1900 [Poi00] he called this the Principle of Relative Motion, i.e., that the laws of movement should be the same in all inertial frames. Alternative terms used by Poincar√© were \\"relativity of space\\" and \\"principle of relativity\\".[Poi02] In 1904 he expanded that principle by saying: \\"The principle of relativity, according to which the laws of physical phenomena must be the same for a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, so that we have no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion.\\" However, he also stated that we do not know if this principle will turn out to be true, but that it is interesting to determine what the principle implies. * In ([Poi00]), Poincar√© published a paper in which he said that radiation could be considered as a fictitious fluid with an equivalent mass of m_r = E/c^2. He derived this interpretation from Lorentz's 'theory of electrons' which incorporated Maxwell's radiation pressure. * Poincar√© had described a synchronization procedure for clocks at rest relative to each other in [Poi00] and again in [Poi04]. So two events, which are simultaneous in one frame of reference, are not simultaneous in another frame. It is very similar to the one later proposed by Einstein.[Sta89], p. 893, footnote 10 However, Poincar√© distinguished between \\"local\\" or \\"apparent\\" time of moving clocks, and the \\"true\\" time of resting clocks in the ether. In [Poi02] he argued that \\"some day, no doubt, the ether will be thrown aside as useless\\". * Lorentz' paper [Lor04] containing the transformations bearing his name appeared in 1904. * Albert Einstein in [Ein05c] derived the Lorentz equations by using the principle of constancy of velocity of light and the relativity principle. He was the first to argue that those principles (along with certain other basic assumptions about the homogeneity and isotropy of space, usually taken for granted by theorists) are sufficient to derive the theory. See Postulates of special relativity. He said: \\"The introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an absolutely stationary space provided with special properties, nor assign a velocity-vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place.\\" * Einstein's Elektrodynamik paper [Ein05c] contains no formal references to other literature. It does mention, in ¬ß9, part II, that the results of the paper are in agreement with Lorentz's electrodynamics. Poincar√© is not mentioned in this paper, although he is cited formally in a paper on special relativity written by Einstein the following year. * In 1905 Einstein was the first to suggest that when a material body lost energy (either radiation or heat) of amount \\\\Delta E, its mass decreased by the amount \\\\Delta E/c^2.[Ein05d], last section * Hermann Minkowski showed in 1907 that the theory of special relativity could be elegantly described using a four-dimensional spacetime, which combines the dimension of time with the three dimensions of space. * Einstein in 1920 returned to a concept of aether having no state of motion.Einstein, Albert: \\"Ether and the Theory of Relativity\\" (1920), republished in Sidelights on Relativity (Methuen, London, 1922) Extract of page 318 Disputed claims The following things seem to be unclear, unknown or disputed: * To what degree Einstein was familiar with Poincar√©'s work ** It is known that Einstein was familiar with [Poi02], but it is not known to what extent he was familiar with other work of Poincar√© in 1905. However it is known that he knew [Poi00] in 1906, because he quoted it in [Ein06]. * Lorentz' paper [Lor04] containing the transformations bearing his name appeared in 1904. The question is whether Einstein was familiar in 1905 with either this paper itself or a review of it (which appeared in the Annalen der Physik). * To what degree Einstein was following other physicists' work at the time. Some authors claim that Einstein worked in relative isolation and with restricted access to the physics literature in 1905. Others, however, disagree; a personal friend of Einstein, Maurice Solovine, later acknowledged that he and Einstein both pored for weeks over Poincar√©'s 1902 book, keeping them \\"breathless for weeks on end\\" [Rot06]. * Whether his wife, Mileva Mariƒá, may have contributed to Einstein's work, although Einstein scholars say that there is no substantive evidence that she made significant contributions. Comments by Lorentz, Poincar√©, and Einstein = Lorentz = In a paper that was written in 1914 and published in 1921,[Lor14] Lorentz expressed appreciation for Poincar√©'s Palermo paper (1906)[Poi06] on relativity. Lorentz stated: However, a 1916 reprint of his main work \\"The theory of electrons\\" contains notes (written in 1909 and 1915) in which Lorentz sketched the differences between his results and that of Einstein as follows: Regarding the fact, that in this book Lorentz only mentioned Einstein and not Poincar√© in connection with a) the synchronisation by light signals, b) the reciprocity of the Lorentz transformation, and c) the relativistic transformation law for charge density, Janssen comments: And at a conference on the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment in 1927 at which Lorentz and Michelson were present, Michelson suggested that Lorentz was the initiator of the theory of relativity. Lorentz then replied: = Poincar√© = Poincar√© attributed the development of the new mechanics almost entirely to Lorentz. He only mentioned Einstein in connection with the photoelectric effect,[Poi13] but not in connection with special relativity. For example, in 1912 Poincar√© raises the question whether \\"the mechanics of Lorentz\\" will still exist after the development of the quantum theory. He wrote: =Einstein= It is now known that Einstein was well aware of the scientific research of his time. The well known historian of science, J√ºrgen Renn, Director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science wrote on Einstein's contributions to the Annalen der Physik:Renn, J.,: Albert Einstein in den Annalen der Physik, 2005 Einstein wrote in 1907 that one needed only to realize that an auxiliary quantity that was introduced by Lorentz and that he called \\"local time\\" can simply be defined as \\"time.\\" In 1909. See also English translation and 1912. English translation: Einstein explained: : But Einstein and his supporters took the position that this \\"light postulate\\" together with the principle of relativity renders the ether superfluous and leads directly to Einstein's version of relativity. It is also known that Einstein had been reading and studying Poincar√©'s 1902-book Science and hypothesis well before 1905, which included: * detailed philosophical assessments on the relativity of space, time, and simultaneity * discussion of the reliance on conventions regarding the use of light signals for the synchronization of clocks * the definition of the principle of relativity and the conjecture that a violation of that principle can never be detected empirically * the possible redundancy of the ether hypothesis * detailed remarks on the physical status of non-Euclidean geometry. Einstein refers to Poincar√© in connection with the inertia of energy in 1906 and the non-Euclidean geometry in 1921,. but not in connection with the Lorentz transformation, the relativity principle or the synchronization procedure by light signals. However, in the last years before his death Einstein acknowledged some of Poincar√©'s contributions (according to Darrigol, maybe because his biographer Pais in 1950 sent Einstein a copy of Poincar√®'s Palermo paper, which he said that he had not read before). Einstein wrote in 1953: Belligerents This section cites notable publications where people have expressed a view on the issues outlined above. =Sir Edmund Whittaker (1954)= In 1954, Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, an English mathematician and historian of science, credited Poincar√© with the equation E=mc^2, and he included a chapter entitled The Relativity Theory of Poincar√© and Lorentz in his book A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity. He credited Poincar√© and Lorentz, and especially alluded to Lorentz's 1904 paper (dated by Whittaker as 1903), Poincar√©'s St. Louis speech (The Principles of Mathematical Physics) of September 1904, and Poincar√©'s June 1905 paper. Whittaker attributed to Einstein's relativity paper only little importance, i.e., the formulation of the Doppler and aberration formulas. Max Born spent three years trying to dissuade Whittaker, but Whittaker insisted that everything of importance had already been said by Poincar√©, and that Lorentz quite plainly had the physical interpretation.Born's letter to Einstein in October of 1953 =Gerald Holton (1960)= Whittaker's claims were criticized by Gerald Holton (1960, 1973). He argued that there are fundamental differences between the theories of Einstein on one hand, and Poincar√© and Lorentz on the other hand. Einstein radically reformulated the concepts of space and time, and by that removed \\"absolute space\\" and thus the stationary luminiferous aether from physics. On the other hand, Holton argued that Poincar√© and Lorentz still adhered to the stationary aether concept, and tried only to modify Newtonian dynamics, not to replace it. Holton argued, that \\"Poincar√©'s silence\\" (i.e., why Poincar√© never mentioned Einstein's contributions to relativity) was due to their fundamentally different conceptual viewpoints. Einstein's views on space and time and the abandonment of the aether were, according to Holton, not acceptable to Poincar√©, therefore the latter only referred to Lorentz as the creator of the \\"new mechanics\\". Holton also pointed out that although Poincar√©'s 1904 St. Louis speech was \\"acute and penetrating\\" and contained a \\"principle of relativity\\" that is confirmed by experience and needs new development, it did not \\"enunciate a new relativity principle\\". He also alluded to mistakes of Whittaker, like predating Lorentz's 1904 paper (published April 1904) to 1903. Views similar to Holton's were later (1967, 1970) expressed by his former student, Stanley Goldberg. =G. H. Keswani (1965)= In a 1965 series of articles tracing the history of relativity, Keswani claimed that Poincar√© and Lorentz should have the main credit for special relativity - claiming that Poincar√© pointedly credited Lorentz multiple times, while Lorentz credited Poincar√© and Einstein, refusing to take credit for himself. He also downplayed the theory of general relativity, saying \\"Einstein's general theory of relativity is only a theory of gravitation and of modifications in the laws of physics in gravitational fields\\". This would leave the special theory of relativity as the unique theory of relativity. Keswani cited also Vladimir Fock for this same opinion. This series of articles prompted responses, among others from Herbert Dingle and Karl Popper. Dingle said, among other things, \\".. the 'principle of relativity' had various meanings, and the theories associated with it were quite distinct; they were not different forms of the same theory. Each of the three protagonists.... was very well aware of the others .... but each preferred his own views\\" Karl Popper says \\"Though Einstein appears to have known Poincar√©'s Science and Hypothesis prior to 1905, there is no theory like Einstein's in this great book.\\" Keswani did not accept the criticism, and replied in two letters also published in the same journal ( and \\\\- in his reply to Dingle, he argues that the three relativity theories were at heart the same: \\".. they meant much that was common. And that much mattered the most.\\" Dingle commented the year after on the history of crediting: \\"Until the first World War, Lorentz's and Einstein's theories were regarded as different forms of the same idea, but Lorentz, having priority and being a more established figure speaking a more familiar language, was credited with it.\\" (Dingle 1967, Nature 216 p. 119-122). =Arthur I. Miller (1973)= Miller (1973, 1981) agreed with the analysis of Holton and Goldberg, and further argued that although the terminology (like the principle of relativity) used by Poincar√© and Einstein were very similar, their content differs sharply. According to Miller, Poincar√© used this principle to complete the aether based \\"electromagnetic world-view\\" of Lorentz and Abraham. He also argued that Poincar√© distinguished (in his July 1905 paper) between \\"ideal\\" and \\"real\\" systems and electrons. That is, Lorentz's and Poincar√©'s usage of reference frames lacks an unambiguous physical interpretation, because in many cases they are only mathematical tools, while in Einstein's theory the processes in inertial frames are not only mathematically, but also physically equivalent. Miller wrote in 1981: :p. 172: \\"Although Poincar√©'s principle of relativity is stated in a manner similar to Einstein's, the difference in content is sharp. The critical difference is that Poincar√©'s principle admits the existence of the ether, and so considers the velocity of light to be exactly c only when it is measured in coordinate systems at rest in the ether. In inertial reference systems, the velocity of light is c and is independent of the emitter's motion as a result of certain compensatory effects such as the mathematical local time and the hypothesis of an unobservable contraction. Consequently, Poincar√©'s extension of the relativity principle of relative motion into the dynamics of the electron resided in electromagnetic theory, and not in mechanics...Poincar√© came closest to rendering electrodynamics consistent, but not to a relativity theory.\\" p. 217: \\"Poincar√© related the imaginary system Œ£' to the ether fixed system S'\\". Miller (1996) argues that Poincar√© was guided by empiricism, and was willing to admit that experiments might prove relativity wrong, and so Einstein is more deserving of credit, even though he might have been substantially influenced by Poincar√©'s papers. Miller also argues that \\"Emphasis on conventionalism ... led Poincar√© and Lorentz to continue to believe in the mathematical and observational equivalence of special relativity and Lorentz's electron theory. This is incorrect.\\" [p. 96] Instead, Miller claims that the theories are mathematically equivalent but not physically equivalent. [p. 91-92] =Abraham Pais (1982)= In his Einstein biography Subtle is the Lord (1982), Abraham Pais argued that Poincar√© \\"comes near\\" to discovering special relativity (in his St. Louis lecture of September 1904, and the June 1905 paper), but eventually he failed, because in 1904 and also later in 1909, Poincar√© treated length contraction as a third independent hypothesis besides the relativity principle and the constancy of the speed of light. According to Pais, Poincar√© thus never understood (or at least he never accepted) special relativity, in which the whole theory including length contraction can simply be derived from two postulates. Consequently, he sharply criticized Whittaker's chapter on the \\"Relativity theory of Poincar√© and Lorentz\\", saying \\"how well the author's lack of physical insight matches his ignorance of the literature\\", although Pais admitted that both he and his colleagues hold the original version of Whittaker's History as a masterpiece. Although he was apparently trying to make a point concerning Whittaker's treatment of the origin of special relativity, Pais' phrasing of that statement was rebuked by at least one notable reviewer of his 1982 book as being \\"scurrilous\\" and \\"lamentable\\". Also in contrast to Pais' overgeneralized claim, notable scientists such as Max Born refer to parts of Whittaker's second volume, especially the history of quantum mechanics, as \\"the most amazing feats of learning, insight, and discriminations\\" while Freeman Dyson says of the two volumes of Whittaker's second edition: \\"it is likely that this is the most scholarly and generally authoritative history of its period that we shall ever get.\\" Pais goes on to argued that Lorentz never abandoned the stationary aether concept, either before or after 1905: :p. 118: \\"Throughout the paper of 1895, the Fresnel aether is postulated explicitly\\"; p. 125: \\"Like Voigt before him, Lorentz regarded the transformation ... only as a convenient mathematical tool for proving a physical theorem ... he proposed to call t the general time and t' the local time. Although he didn't say it explicitly, it is evident that to him there was, so to speak, only one true time t.\\"; p. 166: \\"8.3. Lorentz and the Aether... For example, Lorentz still opines that the contraction of the rods has a dynamic origin. There is no doubt that he had read and understood Einstein's papers by then. However, neither then nor later was he prepared to accept their conclusions as the definitive answer to the problems of the aether.\\" =Elie Zahar (1983)= In several papers, Elie Zahar (1983, 2000) argued that both Einstein (in his June paper) and Poincar√© (in his July paper) independently discovered special relativity. He said that \\"though Whittaker was unjust towards Einstein, his positive account of Poincar√©'s actual achievement contains much more than a simple grain of truth\\". According to him, it was Poincar√©'s unsystematic and sometimes erroneous statements regarding his philosophical papers (often connected with conventionalism), which hindered many to give him due credit. In his opinion, Poincar√© was rather a \\"structural realist\\" and from that he concludes, that Poincar√© actually adhered to the relativity of time and space, while his allusions to the aether are of secondary importance. He continues, that due to his treatment of gravitation and four-dimensional space, Poincar√©'s 1905/6-paper was superior to Einstein's 1905-paper. Yet Zahar gives also credit to Einstein, who introduced Mass‚ÄìEnergy equivalence, and also transcended special relativity by taking a path leading to the development of general relativity. =John Stachel (1995)= John Stachel (1995) argued that there is a debate over the respective contributions of Lorentz, Poincar√© and Einstein to relativity. These questions depend on the definition of relativity, and Stachel argued that kinematics and the new view of space and time is the core of special relativity, and dynamical theories must be formulated in accordance with this scheme. Based on this definition, Einstein is the main originator of the modern understanding of special relativity. In his opinion, Lorentz interpreted the Lorentz transformation only as a mathematical device, while Poincar√©'s thinking was much nearer to the modern understanding of relativity. Yet Poincar√© still believed in the dynamical effects of the aether and distinguished between observers being at rest or in motion with respect to it. Stachel wrote: \\"He never organized his many brilliant insights into a coherent theory that resolutely discarded the aether and the absolute time or transcended its electrodynamic origins to derive a new kinematics of space and time on a formulation of the relativity principle that makes no reference to the ether\\". =Peter Galison (2002)= In his book Einstein's clocks, Poincar√©'s maps (2002),aip.org Peter Galison compared the approaches of both Poincar√© and Einstein to reformulate the concepts of space and time. He wrote: \\"Did Einstein really discover relativity? Did Poincar√© already have it? These old questions have grown as tedious as they are fruitless.\\" This is because it depends on the question, which parts of relativity one considers as essential: the rejection of the aether, the Lorentz transformation, the connection with the nature of space and time, predictions of experimental results, or other parts. For Galison, it is more important to acknowledge that both thinkers were concerned with clock synchronization problems, and thus both developed the new operational meaning of simultaneity. However, while Poincar√© followed a constructive approach and still adhered to the concepts of Lorentz's stationary aether and the distinction between \\"apparent\\" and \\"true\\" times, Einstein abandoned the aether and therefore all times in different inertial frames are equally valid. Galison argued that this does not mean that Poincar√© was conservative, since Poincar√© often alluded to the revolutionary character of the \\"new mechanics\\" of Lorentz. =Olivier Darrigol (2004)= \\"In his 2004 article, \\"The Mystery of the Einstein-Poincar√© Connection\\", Darrigol wrote: =Anatoly Alexeevich Logunov on special relativity (2004)= In Anatoly Logunov's book about Poincar√©'s relativity theory, there is an English translation (on p. 113, using modern notations) of the part of Poincar√©'s 1900 article containing E=mc2. Logunov states that Poincar√©'s two 1905 papers are superior to Einstein's 1905 paper. According to Logunov, Poincar√© was the first scientist to recognize the importance of invariance under the Poincar√© group as a guideline for developing new theories in physics. In chapter 9 of this book, Logunov points out that Poincar√©'s second paper was the first one to formulate a complete theory of relativistic dynamics, containing the correct relativistic analogue of Newton's F=ma. On p. 142, Logunov points out that Einstein wrote reviews for the Beibl√§tter Annalen der Physik, writing 21 reviews in 1905. In his view, this contradicts the claims that Einstein worked in relative isolation and with limited access to the scientific literature. Among the papers reviewed in the Beibl√§tter in the fourth (of 24) issue of 1905, there is a review of Lorentz' 1904-paper by Richard Gans, which contains the Lorentz transformations. In Logunov's view, this supports the view that Einstein was familiar with the Lorentz' paper containing the correct relativistic transformation in early 1905, while his June 1905 paper does not mention Lorentz in connection with this result. =Harvey R. Brown (2005)= Harvey R. Brown (2005) (who favors a dynamical view of relativistic effects similar to Lorentz, but \\"without a hidden aether frame\\") wrote about the road to special relativity from Michelson to Einstein in section 4: :p. 40: \\"The cradle of special theory of relativity was the combination of Maxwellian electromagnetism and the electron theory of Lorentz (and to a lesser extent of Larmor) based on Fresnel's notion of the stationary aether....It is well known that Einstein's special relativity was partially motivated by this failure [to find the aether wind], but in order to understand the originality of Einstein's 1905 work it is incumbent on us to review the work of the trailblazers, and in particular Michelson, FitzGerald, Lorentz, Larmor, and Poincar√©. After all they were jointly responsible for the discovery of relativistic kinematics, in form if not in content, as well as a significant portion of relativistic dynamics as well.\\" Regarding Lorentz's work before 1905, Brown wrote about the development of Lorentz's \\"theorem of corresponding states\\" and then continued: :p. 54: \\"Lorentz's interpretation of these transformations is not the one Einstein would give them and which is standardly embraced today. Indeed, until Lorentz came to terms with Einstein's 1905 work, and somehow despite Poincar√©'s warning, he continued to believe that the true coordinate transformations were the Galilean ones, and that the 'Lorentz' transformations ... were merely a useful formal device...\\" p. 56. \\"Lorentz consistently failed to understand the operational significance of his notions of 'local' time...He did however have an intimation of time dilation in 1899, but inevitably there are caveats...The hypotheses of Lorentz's system were starting to pile up, and the spectre of ad hocness was increasingly hard to ignore.\\" Then the contribution of Poincar√©'s to relativity: :p. 62: \\"Indeed, the claim that this giant of pure and applied mathematics co- discovered special relativity is not uncommon, and it is not hard to see why. Poincar√© was the first to extend the relativity principle to optics and electrodynamics exactly. Whereas Lorentz, in his theorem of corresponding states, had from 1899 effectively assumed this extension of the relativity principle up to second-order effects, Poincar√© took it to hold for all orders. Poincar√© was the first to show that Maxwell's equations with source terms are strictly Lorentz covariant. ‚Ä¶ Poincar√© was the first to use the generalized relativity principle as a constraint on the form of the coordinate transformations. He recognized that the relativity principle implies that the transformations form a group, and in further appealing to spatial isotropy. ‚Ä¶ Poincar√© was the first to see the connection between Lorentz's ‚Äòlocal time‚Äô, and the issue of clock synchrony. ‚Ä¶ It is fair to say that Poincar√© was the first to understand the relativity of simultaneity, and the conventionality of distant simultaneity. Poincar√© anticipated Minkowski's interpretation of the Lorentz transformations as a passive, rigid rotation within a four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space-time. He was also aware that the electromagnetic potentials transform in the manner of what is now called a Minkowski 4-vector. He anticipated the major results of relativistic dynamics (and in particular the relativistic relations between force, momentum and velocity), but not E=mc¬≤ in its full generality.\\" However, Brown continued with the reasons which speak against Poincar√©'s co-discovery: :p. 63-64: \\"What are the grounds for denying Poincar√© the title of co-discoverer of special relativity? ... Although Poincar√© understood independently of Einstein how the Lorentz transformations give rise to non-Galilean transformation rules for velocities (indeed Poincar√© derived the correct relativistic rules), it is not clear that he had a full appreciation of the modern operational significance attached to coordinate transformations.... he did not seem to understand the role played by the second-order terms in the transformation. Compared with the cases of Lorentz and Larmor, it is even less clear that Poincar√© understood either length contraction or time dilation to be a consequence of the coordinate transformation.... What Poincar√© was holding out for was no less than a new theory of ether and matter - something far more ambitions than what appeared in Einstein's 1905 relativity paper...p. 65. Like Einstein half a decade later, Poincar√© wanted new physics, not a reinterpretations or reorganization of existing notions.\\" Brown denies the idea of other authors and historians, that the major difference between Einstein and his predecessors is Einstein's rejection of the aether, because, it is always possible to add for whatever reason the notion of a privileged frame to special relativity, as long as one accepts that it will remain unobservable, and also Poincar√© argued that \\"some day, no doubt, the aether will thrown aside as useless\\". However, Brown gave some examples, what in his opinion were the new features in Einstein's work: :p. 66: \\"The full meaning of relativistic kinematics was simply not properly understood before Einstein. Nor was the 'theory of relativity' as Einstein articulated it in 1905 anticipated even in its programmatic form.\\" p. 69. \\"How did Albert Einstein...arrive at his special theory of relativity?...I want only to stress that it is impossible to understand Einstein's discovery (if that is the right word) of special relativity without taking on board the impacts of the quantum in physics.\\" p. 81. \\"In this respect [Brown refers to the conventional nature of distant simultaneity] Einstein was doing little more than expanding on a theme that Poincar√© had already introduced. Where Einstein goes well beyond the great mathematician is in his treatment of the coordinate transformations... In particular, the extraction of the phenomena of length contraction and time dilation directly from the Lorentz transformations in section 4 of the 1905 paper is completely original.\\" After that, Brown develops his own dynamical interpretation of special relativity as opposed to the kinematical approach of Einstein's 1905 paper (although he says that this dynamical view is already contained in Einstein's 1905-paper, \\"masqueraded in the language of kinematics\\", p. 82), and the modern understanding of space-time. =Roger Cerf (2006)= Roger Cerf (2006) gave priority to Einstein for developing special relativity, and criticized the assertions of Leveugle and others concerning the priority of Poincar√©. While Cerf agreed that Poincar√© made important contributions to relativity, he argued (following Pais) that Poincar√© \\"stopped short before the crucial step\\" because he handled length contraction as a \\"third hypothesis\\", therefore Poincar√© lacked a complete understanding of the basic principles of relativity. \\"Einstein's crucial step was that he abandoned the mechanistic ether in favor of a new kinematics.\\" He also denies the idea, that Poincar√© invented E=mc¬≤ in its modern relativistic sense, because he did not realize the implications of this relationship. Cerf considers Leveugle's Hilbert- Planck-Einstein connection an implausible conspiracy theory. =Shaul Katzir (2005)= Katzir (2005) argued that \\"Poincar√©'s work should not be seen as an attempt to formulate special relativity, but as an independent attempt to resolve questions in electrodynamics.\\" Contrary to Miller and others, Katzir thinks that Poincar√©'s development of electrodynamics led him to the rejection of the pure electromagnetic world-view (due to the non-electromagnetic Poincar√©-Stresses introduced in 1905), and Poincar√©'s theory represents a \\"relativistic physics\\" which is guided by the relativity principle. In this physics, however, \\"Lorentz's theory and Newton's theory remained as the fundamental bases of electrodynamics and gravitation.\\" =Scott Walter (2005, 2007)= Walter (2005) argues that both Poincar√© and Einstein put forward the theory of relativity in 1905. And in 2007 he wrote, that although Poincar√© formally introduced four-dimensional spacetime in 1905/6, he was still clinging to the idea of \\"Galilei spacetime\\". That is, Poincar√© preferred Lorentz covariance over Galilei covariance when it is about phenomena accessible to experimental tests; yet in terms of space and time, Poincar√© preferred Galilei spacetime over Minkowski spacetime, and length contraction and time dilation \\"are merely apparent phenomena due to motion with respect to the ether\\". This is the fundamental difference in the two principal approaches to relativity theory, namely that of \\"Lorentz and Poincar√©\\" on one side, and \\"Einstein and Minkowski\\" on the other side.

He ruled over the region to the north of the river Kaveri. Dark age of Cholas The ancient Chola kingdom once famous in Tamil literature and in the writings of Greek merchants and geographers faded into darkness after c. 300 CE. Cholas during this period almost completely disappeared from their native land. They seem to have held on to their old capital city of Urayur. This \\"dark\\" age of Tamil history came to an end with the ascendancy of the Pandyas and the Pallavas. The Cholas had to wait for another three centuries until the accession of Vijayalaya in the second quarter of the ninth century to re-establish their dynasty. Cholas under Pandyas and Pallavas We know very little of the fate of the Cholas in this long interval. What is certain however is that when the power of Cholas fell to the lowest ebb and that of the Pandyas and Pallavas rose to the north and south of them, this ancient dynasty was compelled to seek refuge and patronage under their more successful rivals. The Cholas, though not prominent or powerful as they were earlier were not completely in danger of extinction and continued to hold sway over a limited area consisting of what are the districts of Mayiladuturai, Chidambaram, Thanjavur, Tiruchy and Pudukkottai in modern Tamil Nadu. Rise of Vijayalaya Chola Making use of the opportunity during a war between Pandyas and Pallavas, Vijayalaya rose out of obscurity and captured Thanjavur. At this time there was a great struggle going on between the Pallavas and the Pandyas for the political supremacy of South India. In this disturbed state of affairs, Vijayalaya seems to have found a good opportunity to defeat the Pandyas, and make himself the ruler of Thanjavur and the surrounding Chola country. He also defeated the Pallavas. Vijayalaya Chola conquered Thanjavur from Elango Mutharaiyar who was the final ruler of Mutharaiyar dynasty. It is said that in the year 852 CE Vijayalaya Chola waged war with Pandya's and defeated the latter. Making use of the opportunity during a war between Pandyas and Pallavas, Vijayalaya rose and established the Chola kingdom at Thanjavur with help of Muttaraiyar king Sattan Paliyilli (826‚Äì852 CE). Cholas became so powerful that the Pallavas were also wiped out from the Thanjavur region at a later stage. Pandyan invasion After Vijayalaya‚Äôs capture of Thanjavur, the Pandyan king Varagunavarman II (c. 862 ‚Äì 885 CE) became a subordinate ally of the Pallava Nandivarman III (c. 846 ‚Äì 869 CE). Nandhivarman wished to curtail the growing influence of Chola power under Vijayalaya and called upon the Varagunavarman to help suppress Vijayalaya. Varaguna led an expedition into the Chola country. The Pandyan army reached the north bank of the Kaveri near Thanjavur and for a while the Chola revival looked short lived. Vijayalaya, by this time a veteran of many battles, was aging and was an invalid. The crown prince Aditya I took control of the army in the defence of the Chola kingdom. Vijayalaya was succeeded after his death c. 871 CE by his son Aditya I. Inscriptions of Vijayalaya The Tiruvalangadu plates state that Vijayalaya captured the city of Tanjavur and made it his capital and that he also built in it a temple to the goddess Nisumbhasudani (Durga). The Kanyakumari inscription states that he renovated the city of Tanjore. Vijayalaya took the title of Parakesarivarman. Chola kings succeeding him took the titles of Parakesari and Rajakesari in turns. This is probably to acknowledge their supposed ancestors Parakesari and Rjakesari. Narttamalai, Pudukkottai has a solesvara temple attributed to Vijayalaya. Notes References * Tamil And Sanskrit Inscriptions Chiefly Collected In 1886 - 87, E.

He was the last fluent Awu Laya (Kuku Thaypan language) speaker. Biography He was born in his own country, near Lakefield National Park. As children, he and his elder brother, George Musgrave, were hidden in mailbags by the station owner, Fredrick Sheppard, to avoid removal by police and welfare officers. As a result, they were able to grow up with their own people, and learn traditional law and language, management practices of their country and how to live off the land. Recently, they were able to successfully claim continuous ownership of traditional lands, and retain custody of some land at Gno-Coom (Saxby Waterhole). Together they founded the Ang-Gnarra Aboriginal Corporation at Laura, Queensland, the biennial Laura Festival of Traditional Dance and Culture, the Traditional Knowledge Recording Project (Mulong, with Victor Steffensen) and the Cape York Land Council. They campaigned to protect the world-renowned Quinkan rock art near Laura, where they carried out custodial duties for special places, including the rock art galleries. They shared their knowledge of the bush, their language and their customs with researchers and visitors. An example of the strength of their sharing was the work they did to share ways of recording traditional knowledge with S√°mi communities in Northern Finland. It would be difficult to find a piece of scholarly work on traditional language, culture or country in Cape York Peninsula that does not credit their expertise. He spent many years working as a stockman on cattle properties on Cape York Peninsula which he loved but was only rarely paid for. He married Laura Gordon (n√©e Banjo) in Laura and they had six children together. He later became a ranger and worked for many years caring for the rock art in the Laura region which was on his wife's country battling to protect it and helping to record and interpret the many stories and traditions about it and his own Kuku Thaypan country. In 2005 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by James Cook University for his ecological expertise along with his elder brother Dr. George Musgrave. George died in the Cooktown, Queensland Hospital on 29 July 2016.  Publications  * George, T., & G. Musgrave (1995). Our country, our art, our Quinkans.

A Cactus-class vessel, she was built by Marine Ironworks and Shipbuilding Corporation in Duluth, Minnesota. Cowslips preliminary design was completed by the United States Lighthouse Service and the final design was produced by Marine Iron and Shipbuilding Corporation in Duluth. On 16 September 1941 the keel was laid. She was launched on 11 April 1942 and commissioned on 17 October 1942. The original cost for the hull and machinery was $918,873. Cowslip is one of 39 original seagoing buoy tenders built between 1942‚Äì1944. All but one of the original tenders, the , were built in Duluth. After commissioning, Cowslip was assigned to Boston, Massachusetts, where she served until 1944. From 1944 until 1973, it was assigned to Portland, Maine. Cowslip was decommissioned in 1973 and later sold to a civilian firm in 1977. After the loss of in 1980, the Coast Guard reacquired Cowslip and recommissioned her as a replacement. After recommissioning, Cowslip was assigned to Governor's Island, New York from 1981‚Äì1983. From 1983‚Äì1984, she was moved to the Coast Guard yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland to take part in the Coast Guard's Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) that eventually provided major upgrades for 14 of the 39 180-class ships. The work done to Cowslip, which cost $8.9 million, was completed in 1984 and required 16 months. The upgrades included new main engines, a Marine Sanitation Device system, upgraded electronics and navigation equipment, a propulsion control computer, and a central fluid power system. In addition, the ships's berthing spaces were renovated, the ship's office and radio room were expanded, additional storeroom space was added and the boom control booth was relocated. After renovation, Cowslip was assigned to Portsmouth, Virginia, where she stayed until 1995. In 1995 Cowslip moved to the west coast and called Astoria, Oregon home port until her retirement. One notable incident in Cowslip's career is a collision with the container ship Ever Grade that occurred in the Columbia River in 1997. Although sustaining significant damage, Cowslip was repaired and sent back into service. Cowslip was decommissioned for a second time in November 2002 and sold to the Nigerian Navy for use as a general purpose vessel.

His nation lived in an area extending from Lake of Two Mountains to modern-day Pembroke, Ontario. Tessouat lived in L'Isle-aux-Allumettes, in a neck of the Ottawa River. He was described by the French settlers as having a strong character. He was also blind in one eye (in French, borgne) and was dubbed \\"le Borgne de l'isle\\". His position was highly strategic, as the Ottawa River was the safest way to go from the St. Lawrence River to Hudson Bay and to Huronia, near Georgian Bay. Tessouat took advantage of his position to impose some sort of customs duties on the French fur traders navigating on the Ottawa River, as well as to impose some of his authority. For example, in 1633, he refused to let the Jesuits go to Huronia, fearing he would lose authority in the region. To maintain the economic supremacy of the Kitchisipirini, he made great efforts to keep his French, Wendat (Huron), and Odawa allies from trading with each other directly, preferring that they trade through Algonquin middlemen. At that time, the Algonquins, Wendats, and several other Great Lakes First Nations were at war with the Iroquois Confederacy. Yet, Tessouat initiated peace talks with the Mohawk nation and, in 1634, they agreed to a peace treaty. The alleged motive behind this political move was to gain access to the Dutch settlers in what is now known the New York State, perhaps in order to be in a better negotiating position with the French traders. Peace with the Mohawks only lasted two years and Tessouat died a few months after bloody fights against the Mohawks. In 1641, after Tessouat's death, in the fashion of an Algonquian custom, a new Tessouat was reborn. The custom consisted of bringing back to life an important dead chief in a highly spectacular ritual. The new Tessouat was brought to life to save the Kitchesipirini nation, which was by then afflicted by death, caused by the European diseases, and isolated after several losses to the Iroquian confederation. Strangely enough, the new Tessouat was also blind in one eye. This fact probably contributed to muddle the French, who sometimes did not distinguish the new Tessouat from the old one. To save his nation, the new Tessouat decided to move from the Ottawa River area to a place nearby the French. After going to Sillery (nearby Quebec), where the Wendats refused their hospitality, Tessouat decides to bring his nation to Montreal island, where he agrees to receive the Christian baptism. In 1647, fearing an attack from the Iroquois and suspecting that the French would not defend them, Tessouat and his nation moved again. The new Tessouat finally died at Trois-Rivi√®res, in 1654.

It is characterized by the high, east-west trending Black Ridge dissected by seven major canyon systems, draining into the Colorado River in Ruby Canyon. Elevations range from above sea level along the river to . Canyons vary in length from several miles to twelve miles in length and may contain interesting side canyons. Geological features in these canyons include spires, windows, giant alcoves and desert varnish. Canyons may reach a depth of almost , forming spectacular redrock cliffs. Spring runoff and summer thunderstorms create glistening waterfalls and plunge pools. Rattlesnake Canyon contains the second largest concentration of natural arches in the country. Mee Canyon is even more remote, and contains Arch Tower. Vegetation in the meandering canyon bottoms includes grasses, pinyon, juniper, cottonwood, willow and box elder. The upland mesas contain dense stands of pinyon and juniper with some sagebrush parks. Cryptobiotic soils are well developed in the upland areas. Wildlife viewing may include deer, mountain lion, desert bighorn sheep, along with golden and bald eagles. The wilderness area is of which are in Colorado and are in Utah. It was designated by the U.S. Congress in 2000 and is administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness forms the core of the McInnis Canyons National Conservation Area.

High Country  The high country of the BRCW is accessible from the community of Glade Park, Colorado. Visitors to this area are treated to a true wilderness experience in a rough, remote land that provides outstanding opportunities for solitude. The Rattlesnake Canyon area is home to the world's second-largest concentration of natural arches (after Arches National Park). Mee Canyon contains a deep alcove that is accessible only by way of a difficult hiking trail which requires and scrambling over many exposed ledges. Knowles and Jones Canyons offer visitors a true wilderness experience, with outstanding opportunities for solitude and a primitive and unconfined type of recreation.  Colorado River  East Rim Arch The Colorado River bisects the McInnis Canyons National Conservation Area and forms the northern boundary of the Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness as it winds its way through Horsethief and Ruby canyons. The river itself is not a part of the wilderness, however floaters are able to hike up many of the main canyons of the area including Rattlesnake Canyon, Moore Canyon, Mee Canyon, and Knowles Canyon. The most popular put in to float this section of the river is the Loma boat launch in Loma, Colorado.

It began as a flood mitigation scheme along the River Torrens running westward from the Adelaide Hills, through the Adelaide metropolitan area, to the sea. Cyclists and walkers can use a trail that runs the length of the park, from Gorge Road, in Athelstone in the north-east, through the Northern Parklands of the City of Adelaide, to the river mouth at Henley Beach in the west.The Australian Institute of Landscape Architects >...> River Torrens Linear Park, Adelaide Accessed 6 December 2013. In the Parklands section, the river runs past many notable landmarks including the Adelaide Zoo, the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, the Festival Theatre and Elder Park. There are shared-use pedestrian and cycling paths along both sides of the river for most of the length of the park, and along one side of the O-Bahn Busway. History The valley of the River Torrens, particularly its lower reaches, had become badly polluted following European settlement in 1836. Land clearance lead to increased runoff and erosion, with major flood events occurring in 1917 and 1933. An artificial channel, Breakout Creek, was completed in 1937, diverting floodwaters directly to the sea, and opening up areas of the western suburbs to housing development, particularly after World War II. Rapid expansion of housing in the eastern suburbs also took place at this time. Awareness of the risk of increased runoff leading to further flooding events lead to various proposals for flood mitigation in the 1950s and 1960s, including converting the river to a concrete-lined channel, or an underground storm-water pipe below a major highway. The Torrens Linear Park concept, using the river valley for combined use as urban open space with flood mitigation, was initially set out in the River Torrens Study (1979) and the River Torrens Flood Mitigation Study (1980). The River Torrens Linear Park and Flood Mitigation Scheme was approved by State Parliament in 1981. A further elaboration, the River Torrens Linear Park Study, included a transport option for a section of the park east of the CBD, which became the O-Bahn guided busway. The scheme required the cooperation of the state government, responsible for land acquisition and flood mitigation works, and the then 12 (now 8) metropolitan councils bordering the river, responsible for landscaping and construction of cycling/walking trails. Construction works began in January 1982, and were completed in September 1997. The Linear Park became protected against further development with the passing of the River Torrens Linear Park Act on 21 June 2006.Greg Kelton, Laws to protect park's future.

The lyrics are not related to the band's usual social criticism, but they took a more romantic, electronic oriented direction, with the support of Cecilia Aguayo on keyboards and Robert Rodr√≠guez on guitars. Also, this was the first record without Claudio Narea (a member of the original line-up) on guitar.

This is the brothers' third film collaboration, after Twin Falls Idaho (1999) and Jackpot (2001). Plot The film's narrative consists of several interwoven subplots taking place in the town of Northfork, Montana circa 1955. A new dam is being built which will flood the valley of Northfork, and the town is in the midst of an evacuation. The narratives focus on several individuals who, for one reason or another, have yet to evacuate. Walter O'Brien (James Woods) and his son (Mark Polish) are on the evacuation team, helping to evacuate the last few inhabitants of Northfork. In return, the government will give them acres of lakeside property if they meet their evacuee quota. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) is one such individual, who has stayed behind to care for Irwin (Duel Farnes), a dying orphan too weak to leave town. While the O'Briens and their co-workers encounter an array of unusual characters, Irwin discovers that he is the \\"unknown angel\\" through a suitcase with his angel wings in it and a bible with an angels feather telling his family 'story', and finds himself a family of angels (Daryl Hannah, Anthony Edwards, Ben Foster, and Robin Sachs) in his dreams, who he makes a deal with to take him 'a thousand miles'.

A Turkish crescent, (a smaller version is called a √ßevgen or √ßaƒüana\\"Chaghana\\" (transliterated in Latin alphabet), Dolmetsch Music Dictionary (Tr.), Turkish jingle, Jingling Johnny, ''''' (Ger.), ''''' or pavillon chinois (Fr.)), is a percussion instrument traditionally used by military bands. In some contexts it also serves as a battle trophy or object of veneration. Description The instrument, usually 2 to 2.5 m long, consists of an upright wooden pole topped with a conical brass ornament and having crescent shaped crosspieces, also of brass. Numerous bells are attached to the crosspieces and elsewhere on the instrument. Often two horsetail plumes of different colors are suspended from one of the crescents; occasionally they are red-tipped, symbolic of the battlefield. There is no standard configuration for the instrument, and of the many preserved in museums, hardly two are alike. The instrument is held vertically and when played is either shaken up and down or twisted. Sometimes there is a geared crank mechanism for rotating it. Today the instrument is prominent in the marching bands of the German Bundeswehr, the French Foreign Legion, the Russian Armed Forces, the Armed Forces of Chile, the Armed Forces of Bolivia and in Ottoman military bands. Some folk music features similar instruments based on a wooden staff with jingling attachments. A notable folk example is the Australian \\"lagerphone\\", made by nailing crown-seal bottle-caps, from beer bottles, onto a wooden broomstick handle, and used to provide a percussive beat for a folk song or bush dance. During its existence, the Soviet Union produced variant forms of the instrument for military bands, with red artificial plumes and the red star finial. Non-musical aspects Turkish crescents had symbolic value for the military units that used them. The 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) famously captured one at the Battle of Salamanca in 1812. It became an object of pride and veneration at the regiment's ceremonial parades. In the early 20th century, Turkish crescents were used in processions honoring important dignitaries. They were skillfully twirled by dignified performers, much as batons are handled today by drum majors. This aspect survives today in the use of Turkish crescents as mostly symbolic objects in military marching bands. This can be clearly seen in the videos in the External links section at the end of this article.  History  Replica of the Turkish crescent presented to King David KalƒÅkaua on the occasion of his visit to Berlin The instrument possibly has antecedents in Central Asian tengrist staffs. Similar instruments occur in ancient Chinese music, perhaps diffused from the same Central Asian (Turkic) sources. Europeans knew of it in the 16th century. In the 18th century, it was part of the Turkish Janissary bands that were the source of much interest in Europe, and in the 19th century, it was widely used in European military bands. It was abandoned by the British in the mid-19th century but survives today, in an altered form, in Germany and in the Netherlands, plus in two military bands in France (the French Foreign Legion and the 1st Spahi Regiment). It is also found in the military bands of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil (examples are in the Brazilian Marine Pipes, Drum and Bugle Corps and the Band of the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment \\"Independence Dragoons\\"). Its presence in the bands of Chile, Brazil and Bolivia is due to the Prussian military influences which arrived in these countries during the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Its heyday in Europe was from the mid-18th to mid-19th century, when it was commonly played by elaborately dressed black Africans, who made all manner of contortions while playing. Some of these gestures survive today, in the stick twirling by bass and tenor drummers. An aspect of the elaborate costumes survives in the leopard skin apron worn by bass drummers in British military bands; however the use of the \\"Jingling Johnny\\" was discontinued in the British Army in 1837. In 1881, the German Emperor William I presented a Turkish crescent to King David KalƒÅkaua on the occasion of the King's visit to Berlin during his trip around the world\\"Influence of Prussia\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, January 23, 2005 bearing the inscription \\"no ka hoomanao ana ia Berlin\\" (to commemorate Berlin),, which was then used by the Royal Hawaiian Band. In the mid-19th century this instrument was replaced in most bands by the glockenspiel, which was carried similarly but could be played musically.

Gopher rockfish have a generally mottled appearance, with dark areas generally olive to reddish brown, and the lighter areas being white or sometimes pinkish. The upper part of the back almost always has three light patches extending into the dorsal fins, and the lighter areas become more extensive ventrally. They range in size up to about 40 cm. They are known from as far north as Cape Blanco in Oregon, down to Punta San Roque in southern Baja California. They can be found in the intertidal zone, but most occur at depths of 12-80 metres, living in crevices and holes during the day, and ranging further abroad at night to feed on benthic crustacea, cephalopods, and some types of fishes. They are territorial, claiming an area of 10-12 square metres. Gophers are extremely closely related to the black-and-yellow rockfish S. chrysomelas; S. chrysomelas is darker brown with yellow patches, and tends to prefer shallower water. While it was once thought that the black-and-yellow and gopher rockfish were merely color morphs of the same species, detailed genomic studies using microsatellite analysis have recently shown, however, that there is a significant amount of genetic difference between the two at loci that code for more than just coloration. This implies that they are indeed distinct, albeit closely related species, making them ideal specimens for studying sympatric evolution. Genetics A PCR-RFLP genetic sex marker has been identified for gopher rockfish, which can successfully distinguish males and females. The marker potentially also works in the black-and-yellow rockfish, but it does not seem to successfully distinguish males and females in various other rockfish species. References  Milton S.

Types of 2D NMR include correlation spectroscopy (COSY), J-spectroscopy, exchange spectroscopy (EXSY), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY). Two-dimensional NMR spectra provide more information about a molecule than one-dimensional NMR spectra and are especially useful in determining the structure of a molecule, particularly for molecules that are too complicated to work with using one- dimensional NMR. The first two-dimensional experiment, COSY, was proposed by Jean Jeener, a professor at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, in 1971. This experiment was later implemented by Walter P. Aue, Enrico Bartholdi and Richard R. Ernst, who published their work in 1976.  Fundamental concepts  Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency (RF) pulses with delay periods in between them. The timing, frequencies, and intensities of these pulses distinguish different NMR experiments from one another. Almost all two-dimensional experiments have four stages: the preparation period, where a magnetization coherence is created through a set of RF pulses; the evolution period, a determined length of time during which no pulses are delivered and the nuclear spins are allowed to freely precess (rotate); the mixing period, where the coherence is manipulated by another series of pulses into a state which will give an observable signal; and the detection period, in which the free induction decay signal from the sample is observed as a function of time, in a manner identical to one-dimensional FT-NMR. The two dimensions of a two-dimensional NMR experiment are two frequency axes representing a chemical shift. Each frequency axis is associated with one of the two time variables, which are the length of the evolution period (the evolution time) and the time elapsed during the detection period (the detection time). They are each converted from a time series to a frequency series through a two-dimensional Fourier transform. A single two-dimensional experiment is generated as a series of one-dimensional experiments, with a different specific evolution time in successive experiments, with the entire duration of the detection period recorded in each experiment. The end result is a plot showing an intensity value for each pair of frequency variables. The intensities of the peaks in the spectrum can be represented using a third dimension. More commonly, intensity is indicated using contour lines or different colors.  Homonuclear through-bond correlation methods  In these methods, magnetization transfer occurs between nuclei of the same type, through J-coupling of nuclei connected by up to a few bonds. = Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) = In standard COSY, the preparation (p1) and mixing (p2) periods each consist of a single 90¬∞ pulse separated by the evolution time t1, and the resonance signal from the sample is read during the detection period over a range of times t2. The first and most popular two-dimension NMR experiment is the homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY) sequence, which is used to identify spins which are coupled to each other. It consists of a single RF pulse (p1) followed by the specific evolution time (t1) followed by a second pulse (p2) followed by a measurement period (t2).Keeler, pp. 190-191. The two-dimensional spectrum that results from the COSY experiment shows the frequencies for a single isotope, most commonly hydrogen (1H) along both axes. (Techniques have also been devised for generating heteronuclear correlation spectra, in which the two axes correspond to different isotopes, such as 13C and 1H.) Diagonal peaks correspond to the peaks in a 1D-NMR experiment, while the cross peaks indicate couplings between pairs of nuclei (much as multiplet splitting indicates couplings in 1D-NMR). Cross peaks result from a phenomenon called magnetization transfer, and their presence indicates that two nuclei are coupled which have the two different chemical shifts that make up the cross peak's coordinates. Each coupling gives two symmetrical cross peaks above and below the diagonal. That is, a cross-peak occurs when there is a correlation between the signals of the spectrum along each of the two axes at these values. An easy visual way to determine which couplings a cross peak represents is to find the diagonal peak which is directly above or below the cross peak, and the other diagonal peak which is directly to the left or right of the cross peak. The nuclei represented by those two diagonal peaks are coupled. 1H COSY spectrum of progesterone. The spectrum that appears along both the horizontal and vertical axes is a regular one dimensional 1H NMR spectrum. The bulk of the peaks appear along the diagonal, while cross-peaks appear symmetrically above and below the diagonal. COSY-90 is the most common COSY experiment. In COSY-90, the p1 pulse tilts the nuclear spin by 90¬∞. Another member of the COSY family is COSY-45. In COSY-45 a 45¬∞ pulse is used instead of a 90¬∞ pulse for the second pulse, p2. The advantage of a COSY-45 is that the diagonal-peaks are less pronounced, making it simpler to match cross- peaks near the diagonal in a large molecule. Additionally, the relative signs of the coupling constants (see J-coupling#Magnitude of J-coupling) can be elucidated from a COSY-45 spectrum. This is not possible using COSY-90.Akitt & Mann, p. 287. Overall, the COSY-45 offers a cleaner spectrum while the COSY-90 is more sensitive. Another related COSY technique is double quantum filtered (DQF) COSY. DQF COSY uses a coherence selection method such as phase cycling or pulsed field gradients, which cause only signals from double-quantum coherences to give an observable signal. This has the effect of decreasing the intensity of the diagonal peaks and changing their lineshape from a broad \\"dispersion\\" lineshape to a sharper \\"absorption\\" lineshape. It also eliminates diagonal peaks from uncoupled nuclei. These all have the advantage that they give a cleaner spectrum in which the diagonal peaks are prevented from obscuring the cross peaks, which are weaker in a regular COSY spectrum.Keeler, pp. 199-203. = Exclusive correlation spectroscopy (ECOSY) = = Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) = Typical TOCSY values for amino acids The TOCSY experiment is similar to the COSY experiment, in that cross peaks of coupled protons are observed. However, cross peaks are observed not only for nuclei which are directly coupled, but also between nuclei which are connected by a chain of couplings. This makes it useful for identifying the larger interconnected networks of spin couplings. This ability is achieved by inserting a repetitive series of pulses which cause isotropic mixing during the mixing period. Longer isotropic mixing times cause the polarization to spread out through an increasing number of bonds.Keeler, pp. 223-226. In the case of oligosaccharides, each sugar residue is an isolated spin system, so it is possible to differentiate all the protons of a specific sugar residue. A 1D version of TOCSY is also available, and by irradiating a single proton the rest of the spin system can be revealed. Recent advances in this technique include the 1D-CSSF (chemical shift selective filter) TOCSY experiment, which produces higher quality spectra and allows coupling constants to be reliably extracted and used to help determine stereochemistry. TOCSY is sometimes called \\"homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy\\" (HOHAHA). = Incredible natural-abundance double-quantum transfer experiment (INADEQUATE) = INADEQUATE is a method often used to find 13C couplings between adjacent carbon atoms. Because the natural abundance of 13C is only about 1%, only about 0.01% of molecules being studied will have the two nearby 13C atoms needed for a signal in this experiment. However, correlation selection methods are used (similarly to DQF COSY) to prevent signals from single 13C atoms, so that the double 13C signals can be easily resolved. Each coupled pair of nuclei gives a pair of peaks on the INADEQUATE spectrum which both have the same vertical coordinate, which is the sum of the chemical shifts of the nuclei; the horizontal coordinate of each peak is the chemical shift for each of the nuclei separately.Keeler, pp. 206-208.  Heteronuclear through-bond correlation methods  Heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy gives signal based upon coupling between nuclei of two different types. Often the two nuclei are protons and another nucleus (called a \\"heteronucleus\\"). For historical reasons, experiments which record the proton rather than the heteronucleus spectrum during the detection period are called \\"inverse\\" experiments. This is because the low natural abundance of most heteronuclei would result in the proton spectrum being overwhelmed with signals from molecules with no active heteronuclei, making it useless for observing the desired, coupled signals. With the advent of techniques for suppressing these undesired signals, inverse correlation experiments such as HSQC, HMQC, and HMBC are actually much more common today. \\"Normal\\" heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy, in which the hetronucleus spectrum is recorded, is known as HETCOR.Keeler, pp. 208-209, 220. =Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC)= 1H‚Äì15N HSQC spectrum of a fragment of the protein NleG3-2. Each peak in the spectrum represents a bonded N‚ÄìH pair, with its two coordinates corresponding to the chemical shifts of each of the H and N atoms. Some of the peaks are labeled with the amino acid residue that gives that signal. HSQC detects correlations between nuclei of two different types which are separated by one bond. This method gives one peak per pair of coupled nuclei, whose two coordinates are the chemical shifts of the two coupled atoms.Keeler, pp. 209-215. HSQC works by transferring magnetization from the I nucleus (usually the proton) to the S nucleus (usually the heteroatom) using the INEPT pulse sequence; this first step is done because the proton has a greater equilibrium magnetization and thus this step creates a stronger signal. The magnetization then evolves and then is transferred back to the I nucleus for observation. An extra spin echo step can then optionally be used to decouple the signal, simplifying the spectrum by collapsing multiplets to a single peak. The undesired uncoupled signals are removed by running the experiment twice with the phase of one specific pulse reversed; this reverses the signs of the desired but not the undesired peaks, so subtracting the two spectra will give only the desired peaks. Heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HMQC) gives an identical spectrum as HSQC, but using a different method. The two methods give similar quality results for small to medium-sized molecules, but HSQC is considered to be superior for larger molecules. =Heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy (HMBC)= HMBC detects heteronuclear correlations over longer ranges of about 2-4 bonds. The difficulty of detecting multiple-bond correlations is that the HSQC and HMQC sequences contain a specific delay time between pulses which allows detection only of a range around a specific coupling constant. This is not a problem for the single-bond methods since the coupling constants tend to lie in a narrow range, but multiple-bond coupling constants cover a much wider range and cannot all be captured in a single HSQC or HMQC experiment.Keeler, pp. 215-219. In HMBC, this difficulty is overcome by omitting one of these delays from an HMQC sequence. This increases the range of coupling constants that can be detected, and also reduces signal loss from relaxation. The cost is that this eliminates the possibility of decoupling the spectrum, and introduces phase distortions into the signal. There is a modification of the HMBC method which suppresses one-bond signals, leaving only the multiple-bond signals.  Through-space correlation methods  These methods establish correlations between nuclei which are physically close to each other regardless of whether there is a bond between them. They use the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) by which nearby atoms (within about 5 √Ö) undergo cross relaxation by a mechanism related to spin‚Äìlattice relaxation. = Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) = In NOESY, the nuclear Overhauser cross relaxation between nuclear spins during the mixing period is used to establish the correlations. The spectrum obtained is similar to COSY, with diagonal peaks and cross peaks, however the cross peaks connect resonances from nuclei that are spatially close rather than those that are through-bond coupled to each other. NOESY spectra also contain extra axial peaks which do not provide extra information and can be eliminated through a different experiment by reversing the phase of the first pulse.Keeler, pp. 274, 281-284. One application of NOESY is in the study of large biomolecules, such as in protein NMR, in which relationships can often be assigned using sequential walking. The NOESY experiment can also be performed in a one-dimensional fashion by pre-selecting individual resonances. The spectra are read with the pre-selected nuclei giving a large, negative signal while neighboring nuclei are identified by weaker, positive signals. This only reveals which peaks have measurable NOEs to the resonance of interest but takes much less time than the full 2D experiment. In addition, if a pre-selected nucleus changes environment within the time scale of the experiment, multiple negative signals may be observed. This offers exchange information similar to the EXSY (exchange spectroscopy) NMR method. NOESY experiments are important tool to identify stereochemistry of a molecule in solvent whereas single crystal XRD used to identify stereochemistry of a molecule in solid form. = Rotating-frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) = ROESY is similar to NOESY, except that the initial state is different. Instead of observing cross relaxation from an initial state of z-magnetization, the equilibrium magnetization is rotated onto the x axis and then spin-locked by an external magnetic field so that it cannot precess. This method is useful for certain molecules whose rotational correlation time falls in a range where the nuclear Overhauser effect is too weak to be detectable, usually molecules with a molecular weight around 1000 daltons, because ROESY has a different dependence between the correlation time and the cross-relaxation rate constant. In NOESY the cross-relaxation rate constant goes from positive to negative as the correlation time increases, giving a range where it is near zero, whereas in ROESY the cross-relaxation rate constant is always positive.Keeler, pp. 273, 297-299. ROESY is sometimes called \\"cross relaxation appropriate for minimolecules emulated by locked spins\\" (CAMELSPIN).  Resolved-spectrum methods  Unlike correlated spectra, resolved spectra spread the peaks in a 1D-NMR experiment into two dimensions without adding any extra peaks. These methods are usually called J-resolved spectroscopy, but are sometimes also known as chemical shift resolved spectroscopy or Œ¥-resolved spectroscopy. They are useful for analysing molecules for which the 1D-NMR spectra contain overlapping multiplets as the J-resolved spectrum vertically displaces the multiplet from each nucleus by a different amount. Each peak in the 2D spectrum will have the same horizontal coordinate that it has in a non- decoupled 1D spectrum, but its vertical coordinate will be the chemical shift of the single peak that the nucleus has in a decoupled 1D spectrum. For the heteronuclear version, the simplest pulse sequence used is called a M√ºller‚ÄìKumar‚ÄìErnst (MKE) experiment, which has a single 90¬∞ pulse for the heteronucleus for the preparation period, no mixing period, and applies a decoupling signal to the proton during the detection period. There are several variants on this pulse sequence which are more sensitive and more accurate, which fall under the categories of gated decoupler methods and spin-flip methods. Homonuclear J-resolved spectroscopy uses the spin echo pulse sequence. Higher-dimensional methods 3D and 4D experiments can also be done, sometimes by running the pulse sequences from two or three 2D experiments in series. Many of the commonly used 3D experiments, however, are triple resonance experiments; examples include the HNCA and HNCOCA experiments, which are often used in protein NMR.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 25, 1971, and noted as \\"an excellent example of mid-18th- century Flemish Bond brick structure\\". History The -story brick house was the home of the first ministers of the first Dutch Reformed Churches in the area, built by the combined efforts of the congregations in Somerville, New Jersey, and Raritan, New Jersey, in 1751. The first occupant was Reverend John Frelinghuysen who taught seminarians in the house. His son Frederick Frelinghuysen was a Captain in the Continental Army. Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh, one of the seminarians who occupied the house after Frelinghuysen's death along with the former reverend's widow and her children, succeeded Frelinghuysen as minister, occupant of the house, and, in 1756, as husband to the former Mrs. Frelinghuysen. Hardenbergh helped establish Queen's College, now known as Rutgers University in 1766 and in 1785 became its first President. He moved from the house in 1781 but it continued in use as a parsonage until 1810. Dr. Peter Stryker bought the house in 1810 and sold it to the Doughty family in 1836. They owned it until 1907 when they sold it to the Central Railroad of New Jersey. In 1913, the house was set to be knocked down by the railroad, but instead it was moved adjacent to the Wallace House, which was built in 1775.

He was a member of the USA National Sprint Team, as well as the DSB Corporate Sprint Team, being coached by Ryan Shimabukuro and Jeroen Otter. At the end of the 2007-2008 season Kip retired from professional speed skating to coach an elite speed skating team Swift Speedskating in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Currently, he is the assistant coach for the Dutch National Team.  Background  Kip was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He later moved to Brookfield, Wisconsin to train at the U.S Olympic Training Facility, the Pettit National Ice Center, in Milwaukee. A former short-track speed skater, Carpenter made the transition to long track in 1998. Three years later, he placed among the top dozen in the 500m at the 2001 World Single Distance Championships. He is best known for his flawless form on the turns from his years skating short track which gives him a distinct advantage over most skaters. Since Salt Lake Kip continues to be one of the best American sprinters, finishing second in the overall U.S. Sprint Championships standings in 2004.

In a 2D experiment, cross peaks must be correlated to the correct nuclei. Using sequential walking, the correct nuclei can be assigned to their crosspeaks. The assigned crosspeaks can give valuable information such as spatial interactions between nuclei. In a NOESY of DNA, for example, each nucleotide has a different chemical shift associated with it. In general, A's are more downstream, T's are more upstream, and C's and G's are intermediate. Each nucleotide has protons on the deoxyribose sugar, which can be assigned using sequential walking. To do this, the first nucleotide in the sequence must be detected. Knowing the DNA sequence helps, but in general the first nucleotide can be determined using the following rules. 1\\\\. 2' and 2\\" protons of a nucleotide will show up in its column, as well as in the column of the next nucleotide in the sequence. For example, in the sequence CATG, in the column for C, its own 2' and 2\\" protons will be seen, but none of the other nucleotides. For A, its own 2' and 2\\" protons will be seen, as well as those from C. 2\\\\. Methyl groups on the nucleotide are seen in the column for the nucleotide containing a methyl group, as well as for the nucleotide preceding it. For example, in CATG, the A and T will contain the methyl peak corresponding to the methyl group on T, but G will not. Once the first nucleotide has been found, you determine which nucleotide is next to it because it should contain the 2' and 2\\" protons from the previous nucleotide. This is done by \\"walking\\" across the spectrum. This process is then repeated sequentially until all nucleotides have been assigned.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1970. History Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh, a Dutch Reformed minister who lived in the nearby Old Dutch Parsonage, sold a small farmhouse and of land to John Wallace, who was a merchant and fabric importer in Philadelphia. In 1775 and 1776, Wallace bought more land, and in 1776 built an eight-room Georgian mansion next to the farmhouse. Wallace named the estate \\"Hope Farm,\\" and planned to retire there. Fireplace The Continental Army camped in the Watchung Mountains at Middlebrook, from Hope Farm during the winter of 1778-79. The Wallace House became George Washington's headquarters, though he only stayed there for 11 days before leaving to attend the Continental Congress in Philadelphia for 6 weeks. Washington returned in February 1779 bringing his wife Martha. The Washingtons were given use of half the house. He then used the house to host foreign dignitaries and official dinners, and to plan military strategy. In particular, he planned the 1779 campaign against the Iroquois League known as the Sullivan Expedition. Guests at the parties included Benedict Arnold, Nathanael Greene, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox, and Baron Steuben.Historic American Buildings Survey - data p.2. Washington left on June 3, 1779, and paid Wallace $1,000. The Wallace family and their slaves then returned to their normal lives in the house. John Wallace, his wife, and his mother-in-law all died in 1783-84, and his youngest son William inherited Hope Farm. William lived there until he died at age 33 in 1796, leaving three orphan children. William's brother Joshua took care of the children and sold Hope Farm to Dickinson Miller in 1801. The Revolutionary Memorial Society bought the house in 1896, and gave it to the State of New Jersey in 1947.

Bonann (born June 28, 1952) is an American lifeguard, television producer, director, writer, and showrunner. He is best known for co-creating the internationally syndicated television series, Baywatch, which ran for eleven seasons (242 episodes), and was listed in the 2001 Guinness Book of World Records as the most widely viewed TV series in the world. His later work includes the syndicated action drama, SAF3, and A Chance For Children, a charitable foundation that benefits homeless and at-risk youth.  Early life  Bonann was born in Santa Monica, California, to Catholic parents Regina (n√©e Caput), a bank teller, and Louis John Bonann, a physician and veteran of World War II. He was raised in West Los Angeles with two sisters, Kathleen and Deborah. As a child, Bonann suffered from severe asthma and allergies. He was born with club feet and severe visual impairment, and was close to death twice before the age of two. Bonann attended Palisades High School from 1967 through 1970, and since his allergies ruled out any outdoor sports, he joined the swim team. Contact lenses corrected his vision, but swimming with them proved difficult, so Bonann needed special visual aids to see the walls of the pool. He ultimately specialized in the backstroke so that he could use the overhead flags to better gauge his turns. He was voted most-improved swimmer in his second year, but he didn't win a competitive race until two years later. In his senior year, Bonann was voted most-valuable. In the fall of 1970, Bonann attended Washington State University as a freshman on a partial athletic scholarship. He was recruited by the U.S. Olympic Committee and trained to compete in the modern pentathlon. Although he didn't qualify for the event, Bonann travelled to Munich for the 1972 Summer Olympics as a non-competitor. When WSU dropped the men's swimming program, Bonann transferred to California State University in Long Beach, California. He continued to swim with the CSULB team, alongside Olympic athletes Gunnar Larsson, Klaus Barth, and Hans Fassnacht, until 1974 when he graduated with a BA degree in journalism.  Lifeguarding  In 1970, Bonann began his lifeguard career as an LA City Ocean Lifeguard. After the completion of rookie academy, he was given his choice of post, and served in lifeguard tower #18 on Will Rogers State Beach, a short distance from his family home in West Los Angeles. Bonann became a Los Angeles County Lifeguard in 1975, when the city and county services merged. He served on the beaches of the Central Section, including Topanga, Will Rogers, Santa Monica, Venice, and Del Rey. Lifeguard Gregory J. Bonann working on Will Rogers State Beach in 1989. Photo by Kim Carlsberg. In the summer of 1977, while working Will Rogers State Beach, Bonann performed a routine rescue of some children who were caught in a riptide. The children's father was Stu Erwin, Jr., who worked for MTM Enterprises, a television production company run by Grant Tinker, the future chairman and CEO of NBC. Bonann would go on to pitch his idea for a television show about lifeguards to Erwin and Tinker, who eventually helped him sell the show to NBC. In 1989, while scouting locations in Venice Beach, California with the Baywatch producers and writing staff, Bonann was approached by a teenager who had lost his friend in the water. Bonann swam out and made three surface dives before finding the boy, who had been submerged for several minutes, and revived him using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while treading water. The boy was taken to UCLA Medical Center where he recovered. Bonann received the Medal of Valor from Los Angeles County for performing that rescue.International Surf Festival Medal of Valor Honorees List In 1994 the L.A. County Lifeguard services merged into the Los Angeles County Fire Department, making Bonann an L.A. County Firefighter within its Lifeguard Division. In 2001, Bonann became an Ocean Lifeguard for Honolulu City and County, Oahu, Hawaii. Bonann transferred to the Northern Section of Los Angeles County in 2013, including Malibu and Zuma beaches,. He has been a Junior Lifeguard Instructor at Zuma Beach for five years. In 2019 he began his 50th year on active status as a Los Angeles County Lifeguard. Bonann has been recognized by both the Belgian Life Saving Federation, and the International Life Saving Federation for his dedication to the field, and in 2000 he was awarded the Gold Medallion from the International Swimming Hall of Fame for his achievements and contributions.  Early film career  Bonann began his career in film and television in 1978 when he was hired by John J. (Jack) Hennessy, of JJH Productions. Hennessy had been producing films for the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Bonann had connections to that world. Hennessy took Bonann under his wing, teaching him to produce and direct documentary films. His first major project was a film called Fire and Ice, the USOC's official film for the 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York, which told the story of the U.S. Men's National Ice Hockey Team victory over the U.S.S.R. and Eric Heiden's historic five gold medals in speed skating. The documentary won several awards, including the CINE Golden Eagle and the 37th International Di Cinema Citta Di Torino for best sports film of the year. When Hennessy died in 1983, Bonann continued to run JJH Productions, producing over twenty films, including two more official films for the USOC. Frozen in Time featured the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, and Elements of Gold highlighted the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. Both films were recognized with numerous awards including the CINE Golden Eagle. In 1987, Bonann formed his own production company called Tower 18 Productions, named for his original lifeguard tower on Will Rogers State Beach. The first project under his new banner was another documentary for the USOC called City of Gold about the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. All of Bonann's Olympic films used slow motion photography and music to accentuate the athlete's performances. This would become his signature style. In fact, many of the camera operators, production crew, and the editor that Bonann used for these early productions would form the core of the Baywatch production company.  Baywatch  During the mid 1970s, Bonann imagined a television series that featured the heroic stories of his lifeguard friends. After meeting Stu Erwin Jr. of Grant Tinker's MTM Enterprises in 1977, he pitched the idea, which at that time was called A.C.E.S., for Aquatic Corps for Emergency Service. Erwin declined, but he encouraged Bonann to continue to develop the concept. In 1981, while working at JJH Productions, Bonann began pitching the idea again. At his mother's suggestion, he renamed the show Baywatch, but he continued his attempts to sell the series with no success for the next six years. Bonann met the writing team of Douglas Schwartz and Michael Berk through his sister, Deborah, who was engaged to Schwartz. They agreed to help Bonann develop the project. The three of them took Baywatch back to Stu Erwin, Jr., who was still working for Grant Tinker at his new production company, GTG Entertainment. In 1988, Tinker and Erwin added Baywatch to their projects in development. Due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, GTG was unable to use a written script to pitch the show, so Tinker asked Bonann to produce a video sales presentation. Bonann used his documentary crew to shoot and edit footage of the March 1988 lifeguard tryouts, along with slow motion action shots of several of his lifeguard friends. On the strength of that presentation, Brandon Tartikoff purchased a two-hour movie pilot for NBC, after which Baywatch was picked up for series. After one season on NBC, Baywatch was canceled. Tinker sold the rights to the program back to Bonann for ten dollars, and along with Schwartz, Berk, and the show's lead actor, David Hasselhoff, Bonann launched the series in first-run syndication, resulting in ten more seasons, including two in Hawaii, and even a short-lived spinoff series called Baywatch Nights. Bonann's relationship with the L.A. County Lifeguards allowed him to build a functioning interior and exterior set above the actual lifeguard headquarters on Will Rogers State Beach, where Bonann began his lifeguard career nearly twenty years earlier. Baywatch was seen in 145 countries and was translated into over 42 languages. It was listed in the 2001 Guinness Book of World Records as the most widely viewed TV series in the world with a weekly audience of over 1.1 billion. By its end, Bonann had executive produced 289 episodes of Baywatch, Baywatch Nights, and Baywatch Hawaii. He directed a total of 75 episodes and 400 of his signature music montages. From the beginning of the pilot movie in 1988 to the wrap of the final episode in 2001, Baywatch had dominated 14 years of Bonann's life. You can hear Greg in his own words share his BAYWATCH journey on the podcast Setbacks and Success.  Later career  In addition to his work on Baywatch, Bonann produced several TV pilots, series and TV movies, including Steel Chariots for Fox, Thunder in Paradise starring Hulk Hogan, and a pilot movie for UPN called Avalon: Beyond the Abyss. In 2002, NBC and MGM Television launched a new series called She Spies starring Natasha Henstridge. After four episodes, the production shut down due to budget overages and creative discord. The network and studio turned to Bonann to solve the problems, and production resumed. The series went on to complete two seasons and forty episodes. In 2008, Bonann and partner Tai Collins, a writer on Baywatch, began developing an action drama series called Rescue 3. After partnering with Emmet-Furla Films, financing was raised. The series was renamed SAF3, and Dolph Lundgren and J.R. Martinez were cast as leads. Bonann began filming SAF3 in Cape Town, South Africa in 2013, and twenty episodes were produced independently for first-run syndication. It became the first independently financed one-hour drama to air in the U.S. on prime time. To date the series has been sold in sixty-six countries.  Philanthropy  In 1992, Bonann and partner, Collins, launched a non-profit organization called The Camp Baywatch Foundation to benefit homeless and at-risk youth. The foundation began by teaching inner city children about water safety through a week-long summer camp at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California. Bonann called in favors from Baywatch cast members, Olympic athletes, and other celebrities who volunteered at the camp. The children were not only taught to swim in both a pool and the ocean, but each received individual instruction in water safety from LA County Lifeguard, U.S. Coast Guard, and L.A. County Fire personnel. Since then, the charity has grown into a year-round program, partnering with Los Angeles Unified School District, Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Police Department. In addition to the Summer Camp the foundation offers a variety of after-school, summer, and sports programs, as well as educational trips, and college scholarships. When the Baywatch television series ended in 2001, the foundation name was changed to \\"A Chance For Children Foundation\\". NBC's The Today show honored Bonann in 2009 by choosing A Chance For Children as one of their charities of the year. In 2013, while working on SAF3, Bonann and Collins established a new branch of A Chance for Children in Cape Town, South Africa. This international extension of the foundation focuses on the education of the children of the townships of Langa, Gugulethu, and Khayelitsha.

The fast optical signal (EROS) measures changes in infrared light scattering that occur with neural activity. Whereas techniques such as diffuse optical imaging (DOI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measure optical absorption of hemoglobin, and thus are based on cerebral blood flow, EROS takes advantage of the scattering properties of the neurons themselves, and thus provide a much more direct measure of cellular activity. Characteristics EROS can pinpoint activity in the brain within millimeters and milliseconds, providing good spatial and temporal resolution at the same time. Currently, its biggest limitation is the inability to detect activity more than a few centimeters deep, which thus limits this fast optical imaging to the cerebral cortex. EROS can be measured using photon delay or as an intensity signal. EROS can also be measured concurrently with other neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, fNIRS, or EEG. History EROS is a relatively new and inexpensive technique that is non- invasive to the test subject. It was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in the Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory of Drs. Gabriele Gratton and Monica Fabiani. EROS was first demonstrated in the visual cortex in 1995, and later in the motor cortex that same year.

The transmitter is off Ralph Avenue in Stockton, along with the studios and offices.Radio- Locator.com/KSTN Programming is also heard on 250 watt FM translator K290AG at 105.9 MHz.Radio-Locator.com/K290AG History On November 27, 1949 at 6 AM, KSTN signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1951 page B-97 KSTN's first General Manager was Dave Greene and the original power was 1,000 watts. It was owned by Knox LaRue until his death on December 22, 2004. An FM station, originally 107.3 KSTN-FM (now KLVS) went on the air in 1962. The LaRue Family planned to sell KSTN-AM-FM to Independence Media Holdings of Dallas, Texas, for $24,250,000 in 2008. Due to the bad economy, the deal fell through. At its inception, KSTN's programming was Big Band/Swing, with some Country western Music in the afternoons with Dusty Duncan as the host. Other early KSTN on-air personalities included Bud Hobbs, Bill Elliott and Paula Stone. The station switched to a Top 40 format in 1957. In 1962, station owner Knox LaRue contracted with noted Top 40 radio programmer Bill Drake to program KSTN. Upon leaving San Francisco's KYA in 1962, Bill Drake was hired to split time as program director of both KYNO in Fresno, and KSTN in Stockton, California. KSTN owner Knox LaRue (December 18, 1922 ‚Äì December 22, 2004) was a business partner with KYNO owner Gene Chenault in various ventures. They co-hired Drake upon the recommendation of Jane Swain, LaRue's general manager at KSTN, who had worked with Drake at WAKE in Atlanta. While the classic KMAK‚ÄìKYNO battle of Fresno has been well documented, KSTN and LaRue are certainly owed their debt as well. A pioneer of the Top 40 genre, LaRue built KSTN in 1949, and began playing the popular music of the day. As the rock era began, KSTN just stayed with it, providing a training ground for numerous talents. Among the audio exhibits on the ReelRadio.com site are the original deejay jingles from Drake's tenure at KSTN. These rare artifacts from his Stockton days are precursors to the Johnny Mann acapellas and Bill Drake-voiced jock intros and station IDs of the \\"Boss Radio\\" era. Other elements of the famed Drake format were also initiated and honed during his stint at KSTN in the early 1960s. KSTN hired John Hampton for weekends on September 24, 1980, the airshift previously held by Jay Richard (aka Tom Richard). John was promoted to full- time in 1981 and was made program director in September 1981. In 1981, KSTN switched from Rhythmic Top 40 to Pop Top 40. In 1984, KSTN switched back to Rhythmic Top 40. In the late 1980s and the 1990s, while many other radio stations on the AM dial changed to news/talk formats, KSTN continued its music broadcasts. In 1995, John Hampton was moved to mornings. In 1999, KSTN changed its format to a Variety Hits Oldies format it called \\"Power Oldies 1420.\\" KSTN played may types of music including Doo Wop Oldies of the '50s, Top 40 of the '60s and '70s, '70s Disco, Classic rock of the '70s and '80s, punk, Alternative Music of the '80s and '90s and an occasional touch of Country. In 2005, KSTN fine-tuned its format to Classic Hits, which is a format more common for the FM dial; KSTN no longer branded itself as \\"Power Oldies 1420.\\" KSTN also added local sports play-by-play to its schedule, including Oakland A's baseball, Stockton Ports baseball, Stockton Thunder ECHL hockey, and University of the Pacific Tigers athletics. On February 13, 2006, KSTN replaced John Hampton's Morning Show with the syndicated \\"Mancow's Morning Madhouse\\" from Chicago via satellite. This marked the first time KSTN had placed a syndicated show in its daily lineup. On February 19, 2010, after over 60 years on the air, KSTN went silent. The station played \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" by Queen followed by the theme from WKRP in Cincinnati before signing off the air for the final time at 6:15 pm. As of January 2012, the station is on the air again with a syndicated country format.http://radio- locator.com/info/KSTN-AM On February 13, 2013 KSTN changed their format to classic country. After a weekend of stunting, on March 17, 2014 KSTN changed their format to country, branded as \\"105.9 The Bull\\" (the frequency in the branding is for FM translator K290AG 105.9 FM Stockton).Bull Launches in Stockton References External links KSTN (1420 AM) in the Central Valley Radio Museum *KSTN Power Oldies 1420 Tribute (Streaming Digital Radio) *KSTN airchecks with slideshows  STN Radio stations established in 1949 1949 establishments in California ","title":"KSTN (AM)"},{"id":"4023213","text":"The following is a list of Jewish political milestones in the United States. *First Jewish member of a colonial legislature (South Carolina): Francis Salvador (1775) *First Jewish soldier killed in the American Revolutionary War: Francis Salvador (1776) *First Jewish member of the U.S. Congress (U.S. House of Representatives): Lewis Charles Levin (1845) *First Jewish member of the United States Senate: David Levy Yulee (1845) *First Jewish mayor of a major American city (Portland, Oregon): Bernard Goldsmith (1869) ** Two years later, Philip Wasserman became a mayor of Portland (1871) *First elected Jewish governor of a U.S. state: Washington Bartlett (California) (1887) *First Jewish Cabinet member/Secretary of Commerce and Labor: Oscar Straus (1906) **Not including Judah P.

Etymology The species epithet mystinus derives from the Greek for \\"priest\\", referring to the overall dark color. Description Blue rockfish off Cannery Point, Point Lobos State Natural Reserve Blue rockfish have a relatively smooth and oval appearance compared to other members of Sebastes, with very few head spines. Color is a bluish black to gray, with some darker mottling, including a pair of stripes angling down and back from the eye. The terminal mouths are small for rockfish. Length ranges up to 55 to 60 cm, and weights up to 3.8 kg. =Ecology= The main diet of the species is plankton. Juveniles consume tiny crustacea such as copepods and barnacle larvae (in some cases having a significant effect on the population), while adults shift to larger types, such as free-swimming tunicates, jellyfish, gastropods, squids, young rockfish, and drifting plant fragments. Distribution Blue rockfish occur from northern Baja California to central Oregon. Previous records further north are due to confusion with the deacon rockfish (S. diaconus), which only was scientifically described in 2015. While they have been caught at depths of over 500 m, most live near to the surface, down to 90 m. Genetics A potential PCR-RFLP genetic sex marker developed for gopher rockfish does not successfully distinguish male and female blue rockfish. Fishing and management Blue rockfish were once an important part of the California fishery; they were the most common rockfish marketed in San Francisco and San Diego during the 19th century, but have since declined in popularity. They continue to be of interest as game fish, and are among the most common types landed by boat anglers; in fact, there is evidence of overfishing in Monterey Bay and southern California.

She is a UCI Distinguished Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science and of Mathematics at the University of California, Irvine. She is well known for her influential work in the philosophy of mathematics, where she has worked on mathematical realism (especially set-theoretic realism) and mathematical naturalism. Education Maddy received her Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1979. Her dissertation, Set Theoretical Realism, was supervised by John P. Burgess. Philosophical work Maddy's early work, culminating in Realism in Mathematics, defended Kurt G√∂del's position that mathematics is a true description of a mind-independent realm that we can access through our intuition. However, she suggested that some mathematical entities are in fact concrete, unlike, notably, G√∂del, who assumed all mathematical objects are abstract. She suggested that sets can be causally efficacious, and in fact share all the causal and spatiotemporal properties of their elements. Thus, when one sees three cups on a table, one also sees the set. She used contemporary work in cognitive science and psychology to support this position, pointing out that just as at a certain age we begin to see objects rather than mere sense perceptions, there is also a certain age at which we begin to see sets rather than just objects. In the 1990s, she moved away from this position, towards a position described in Naturalism in Mathematics. Her \\"naturalist\\" position, like Quine's, suggests that since science is our most successful project so far for knowing about the world, philosophers should adopt the methods of science in their own discipline, and especially when discussing science. As Maddy stated in an interview, \\"If you‚Äôre a ‚Äònaturalist‚Äô, you think that science shouldn‚Äôt be held to extra-scientific standards, that it doesn‚Äôt require extra-scientific ratification.\\" However, rather than a unified picture of the sciences like Quine's, she has a picture on which mathematics is separate. This way, mathematics is neither supported nor undermined by the needs and goals of science, but is allowed to obey its own criteria. This means that traditional metaphysical and epistemological concerns of the philosophy of mathematics are misplaced. Like Wittgenstein, she suggests that many of these puzzles arise merely because of the application of language outside its proper domain of significance. She has been dedicated to understanding and explaining the methods that set theorists use in agreeing on axioms, especially those that go beyond ZFC.

Early life Plendl was born in 1900 in Munich, German Empire to parents from Northern Bavaria. His surname is most likely a truncated Bavarian dialect form of \\"Plendlein.\\" Plendl served briefly in the Imperial German Navy during World War I. Shortly thereafter, Plendl began his career as a radio and beam engineer for Telefunken corporation. His early research into meter-wave propagation and radar beams necessitated additional names for newly discovered levels of the Earth's atmosphere, and Plendl is generally credited with coining the term ionosphere. In the early 1930s, Plendl worked on developing the radio communications used in flights by civilian aircraft and the Hindenburg Zeppelin. His research and developments with the Lorenz beam landing system gave birth to what is now known as ILS, Instrument Landing System. X-System As Nazi Germany rearmed, Plendl and others saw the possibilities of using radio beams to guide bombers to their target, and they began to develop a system under the code name \\"X-System\\" (X-Verfahren).Price, Alfred. Instruments of Darkness. William Kimber and Co., 1967, p. 23. Using technology previously used for his Lorenz beam landing system, Plendl developed a system that would guide planes to their target, and which improved the accuracy of bombing at night or in poor weather conditions.Niehaus, Werner. Die Radarschlacht. William Kimber and Co., 1967, p. 35. This work was conducted for the German Airforce (Luftwaffe) at the Airforce Experimental Station (Erprobungstelle der Luftwaffe) at Rechlin, Germany, and also at Peenem√ºnde.Wakefield, Ken. Pfadfinder: Lufftwaffe Pathfinder Operations Over Britain, 1940‚Äì44. p. 17 At the same time the system code named \\"Knickebein\\" was coined by the Telefunken electronics firm. Although it could use the Lorenz landing system for guidance, it was less accurate and more prone to jamming.Price, Alfred. Instruments of Darkness. William Kimber and Co., 1967, p. 24. Both systems employed transmitter towers on the English channel and the North Sea to transmit radar beams over targets in England. German bombers carried basic radar detectors and complex timing devices, also invented by Dr. Plendl, to lead them on the correct path and to guide the timing of the release of their bombs. When Germany invaded Poland, the X-System was used effectively against military targets, but on a limited basis, due to the few number of planes equipped with the X-Device (X-Ger√§t, the electronic component of the system carried in the plane.) and the short duration of the campaign.Wakefield, Ken. Pfadfinder: Lufftwaffe Pathfinder Operations Over Britain, 1940‚Äì44. p. 17Niehaus, Werner. Die Radarschlacht. William Kimber and Co., 1967, p. 39. During the air war over the England and Scotland known as The Battle of Britain the Knickebein, X-System and Y-System were all used extensively, but their effectiveness was diminished by countermeasures developed by Reginald Victor Jones and others, who were able use electronic countermeasures to redirect or jam the radio signals of the navigation systems in what has become known as the Battle of the Beams.Jones, R.V. The Wizard War. Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1978 pp.106‚Äì179. Dr. Plendl was given the title of state plenipotentiary and privy councillor (Staatsrat) by Hermann G√∂ring for his work.Jones, R.V. The Wizard War. Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1978 pp.179‚Äì180. He was named National Director of High Frequency Research (Bevollm√§chtigten der Hochfrequenzforschung). Plendl was dismissed by the German High Command after holding the post for about a year. Different sources speculate why. Some state it was after a heavy British raid upon Hamburg used a special counterradar technique called Window or chaff.Maier, Helmut Forschung als Waffe. R√ºstungsforschung in der Kaiser-Wilhelm- Gesellschaft und das Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Metallforschung 1900‚Äì1945/48. Bd. 2. Wallstein-Verlag, 2007, p. 776 p. 1012. Other sources state that the reason for Plendl's dismissal was his saving several people from sure death in concentration camps, by claiming he needed their (non-existent) \\"expertise\\" to help his beam program.Price, Alfred. Instruments of Darkness. William Kimber and Co., 1967, p. 196.Brown, Louis. A Radar History of World War II. According to Plendl's own account, he was dismissed after a heated argument with Generaloberst Weise, the Chief of Flak over areas of responsibility after Plendl developed a new type of Flak shell.Brown, Louis. \\"A Radar History of World War II.\\" Institute of Physics Publishing, 1999, p. 314. Move to America At the end of the war, Plendl surrendered to the Americans. Like other German scientists, Plendl was invited to come to the United States to aid in American weapons development, as part of \\"Operation Paperclip.\\" U.S. government records noted that he had regularly voiced opposition to the Nazi regime. Particularly noteworthy was the fact that Plendl had saved a number of people, including many Jews, from the Dachau concentration camp, under the guise of needing them to work on his projectsBrown, Louis. A Radar History of World War II. Many of these individuals had no scientific background. In this manner, Plendl differed from other German scientists, who voiced no opposition to the regime. The most notable figure who Plendl saved was Hans Mayer, the author of the Oslo Report. In sending this report to the British Government in November 1939 just after the beginning of the war, Mayer had performed perhaps the most serious breach of German security in World War II, although this was not known to his colleagues (or the Gestapo) at that time. Mayer had been the Director of the Siemens Research Laboratory in Berlin, up to the time of his arrest in 1943 for listening to the BBC and criticism of the Nazi regime. Plendl appointed Mayer to head a radio laboratory even though Mayer's expertise was in telephony, and not in radio. Plendl finished his military career in the United States Air Force, at their Cambridge Research Laboratory. He specialized in the field of solid-state physics. Later life Plendl helped Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer establish a Europe-wide network of stations observing the solar activity in order to predict disturbances of the Ionosphere that interrupted the military radio connections. Plendl and Kiepenheuer may so be seen as the fathers of the science now called space weather, A considerable part of their network prevailed after the war in one or another organisation. In 1970, Plendl retired to Europe, taking residence in Italy. R.V. Jones, the British scientist who had worked on the other end of the channel to jam Plendl's beams, became a good friend, and the two corresponded regularly and collaborated on several books. Johannes Plendl died in 1992. Further reading *Brown, Louis. A Radar History of World War II. *Jones, R.V. Most Secret War. *Niehaus, Werner. Die Radarschlacht.

Originating in York County near the northern side a few miles west of Yorktown, it flows south across the Virginia Peninsula and is almost entirely located in the independent city of Newport News. The Warwick River took its name from Robert Rich, second Earl of Warwick and a prominent member of the Virginia Company of London who was proprietor of Richneck Plantation in Warwick River Shire, one of the eight original shires of Virginia created in 1634. The shire became Warwick County in 1643, and became part of the independent city of Newport News in 1958 through a municipal consolidation. Union troops cross the river in 1862 In 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War, the Warwick Line, a defensive works across the peninsula, was maintained along the river by Confederate General John B. Magruder against much larger Union forces under General George B. McClellan. Through the use of elaborate ruse tactics, \\"Prince John\\" Magruder, who was also an actor, provided valuable time for the ultimately successful defense of Richmond led by General Robert E. Lee which culminated in the Seven Days Battles. The Warwick River adjoins Fort Eustis, a U.S. Army base, on its western shore, which also occupies historic Mulberry Island.

The survivors eventually reached Virginia after building two small ships during the ten months they spent on the island. His account of the incident and of the Virginia colony is thought by most Shakespearean scholars to have been a source for Shakespeare's play The Tempest.

In 1605 he was at Gray's Inn, but there is no evidence that he made the law his profession. In 1602 he inherited his father's estate following a legal dispute with Elizabeth Brocket, his stepmother. Career Strachey's sonnet, Upon Sejanus, published in Ben Jonson's Sejanus His Fall (1605) Strachey wrote a sonnet, Upon Sejanus,Upon Sejanus, Encyclopedia Virginia Retrieved 28 March 2013. which was published in the 1605 edition of the 1603 play Sejanus His Fall by Ben Jonson. Strachey also kept a residence in London, where he regularly attended plays. He was a shareholder in the Children of the Revels, a troupe of boy actors who performed 'in a converted room in the former Blackfriars monastery', as evidenced by his deposition in a lawsuit in 1606. According to Sisson: > In 1600 Richard Burbage leased to [Henry] Evans his Blackfriars property, > and the Children of the Revels under Nathaniel Giles, with Evans as landlord > and partner, occupied the theatre for some years. Evans assigned his rights > in the property and the company in two stages, first one-half in sixths to > [Edward] Kirkham, [Thomas] Kendall and [William] Rastell, and subsequently > the second half in sixths to John Marston, William Strachey, and his own > wife. There were later complications. But in 1606 William Strachey had a > one-sixth share in the Blackfriars Theatre. Strachey, there is no manner of > doubt on the evidence and from the signature of his deposition, was the > well-known voyager and writer whose account of the Bermuda voyage left its > marks on Shakespeare‚Äôs Tempest. He gave evidence in the suit as ‚ÄòWilliam > Strachey, of Crowhurst, Surrey, gentleman, aged 34‚Äô on 4 July 1606.Sisson > cites the lawsuit as P.R.O. C 24/327/22; ; . Strachey became friends with the city's poets and playwrights, including Thomas Campion, John Donne, Ben Jonson, Hugh Holland, John Marston, George Chapman, and Matthew Roydon, many of them members of the \\"Fraternity of Sireniacal Gentlemen\\" who met at the Mermaid Tavern.. By 1605 Strachey was in precarious financial circumstances from which he spent the rest of his life trying to recover. In 1606 he used a family connection to obtain the position of secretary to Thomas Glover, the English ambassador to Turkey. He travelled to Constantinople, but quarrelled with the ambassador and was dismissed in March 1607 and returned to England in June 1608.. He then decided to mend his fortunes in the New World, and in 1609 purchased two shares in the Virginia Company and sailed to Virginia on the Sea Venture with Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers in the summer of that year. =Shipwreck of the Sea Venture= Strachey was a passenger aboard the flagship Sea Venture with the leaders of the expedition when the ship was blown off course by a hurricane. Leaking, and with its foundering imminent, the ship was run aground off the coast of Bermuda, accidentally beginning England's colonisation of that Atlantic archipelago. The group was stranded on the island for almost a year, during which they constructed two small boats in which they eventually completed the voyage to Virginia. Strachey wrote an eloquent letter dated 15 July 1610, to an unnamed \\"Excellent Lady\\" in England about the Sea Venture disaster, including an account of the precarious state of the Jamestown colony. Being critical of the management of the colony, it was suppressed by the Virginia Company. After the dissolution of the company it was published in 1625 by Samuel Purchas as \\"A true reportory of the wracke, and redemption of Sir THOMAS GATES Knight\\". It is generally thought to be one of the sources for Shakespeare's The Tempest because of certain verbal, plot and thematic similarities.Vaughan, Virginia Mason; Vaughan, Alden T. (1999). The Tempest. The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series. The Arden Shakespeare, p. 287. . Strachey's writings are among the few first-hand descriptions of Virginia in the period. His glossary of words of the Powhatan. is one of only two records of the language (the other being Captain John Smith's). =Later life and death= Strachey remained at Jamestown for less than a year, but during that time he became the Secretary of the Colony after the drowning death of Matthew Scrivener in 1609. He returned to England probably in late 1611 and published a compilation of the colonial laws put in place by the governors. He then produced an extended manuscript about the Virginia colony, The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia, dedicating the first version to Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, in 1612. The manuscript included his eyewitness account of life in early Virginia, but borrowed heavily from the earlier work of Richard Willes, James Rosier, John Smith, and others. Strachey produced two more versions during the next six years, dedicating one to Francis Bacon and the other to Sir Allen Apsley. It too was critical of the Virginia Company management of the colony, and Strachey failed to find a patron to publish his work, which was finally first published in 1849 by the Hakluyt Society. Strachey died of unknown causes in June 1621. The parish register of St Giles' Church, Camberwell, in Southwark records his burial on 21 June 1621. He died in poverty, leaving this verse: :Hark! Twas the trump of death that blew :My hour has come. False world adieu :Thy pleasures have betrayed me so :That I to death untimely go. In 1996, Strachey's signet ring was discovered in the ruins of Jamestown, identified by the family seal, an eagle. Marriages and issue On 9 June 1595 Strachey married Frances Forster, 'the daughter of a prosperous Surrey family with political connections'. Frances Forster was the daughter of William Forster and Elizabeth Draper (died 22 April 1605), widow of John Bowyer (died 10 October 1570) of Shepton Beauchamp, Somerset, and daughter of Robert Draper of Camberwell, Surrey, Page of the Jewels to King Henry VIII, by Elizabeth Fyfield.; ; ; .'Parishes: Camberwell', A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4 (1912), pp. 24-36 Date accessed: 29 March 2013. Strachey lived in London while Frances remained at her father's estate in Crowhurst, Surrey. They had two children, William Strachey (died 1635), born nine months after the marriage in 1596, and Edmund Strachey, born in 1604. Frances died before 1615, and at some time before that date Strachey married a widow whose first name was Dorothy, by whom he does not appear to have had any issue. Strachey's son, William, married three times, and died in 1635..

Substances that flow become essentially horizontal in their containers (or other physical boundaries) because of gravity whereas most bulk solids pile at an angle of repose to a peak. The substance to be measured can be inside a container or can be in its natural form (e.g., a river or a lake). The level measurement can be either continuous or point values. Continuous level sensors measure level within a specified range and determine the exact amount of substance in a certain place, while point-level sensors only indicate whether the substance is above or below the sensing point. Generally the latter detect levels that are excessively high or low. There are many physical and application variables that affect the selection of the optimal level monitoring method for industrial and commercial processes. The selection criteria include the physical: phase (liquid, solid or slurry), temperature, pressure or vacuum, chemistry, dielectric constant of medium, density (specific gravity) of medium, agitation (action), acoustical or electrical noise, vibration, mechanical shock, tank or bin size and shape. Also important are the application constraints: price, accuracy, appearance, response rate, ease of calibration or programming, physical size and mounting of the instrument, monitoring or control of continuous or discrete (point) levels. In short, level sensors are one of the very important sensors and play very important role in a variety of consumer/ industrial applications. As with other types of sensors, level sensors are available or can be designed using a variety of sensing principles. Selection of an appropriate type of sensor suiting to the application requirement is very important. Point and continuous level detection for solids A variety of sensors are available for point level detection of solids. These include vibrating, rotating paddle, mechanical (diaphragm), microwave (radar), capacitance, optical, pulsed- ultrasonic and ultrasonic level sensors. =Vibrating point = Principle of vibration point probe These detect levels of very fine powders (bulk density: 0.02 g/cm3 ‚Äì 0.2 g/cm3), fine powders (bulk density: 0.2 g/cm3 ‚Äì 0.5 g/cm3), and granular solids (bulk density: 0.5 g/cm3 or greater). With proper selection of vibration frequency and suitable sensitivity adjustments, they can also sense the level of highly fluidized powders and electrostatic materials. Single-probe vibrating level sensors are ideal for bulk powder level. Since only one sensing element contacts the powder, bridging between two probe elements is eliminated and media build-up is minimized. The vibration of the probe tends to eliminate build-up of material on the probe element. Vibrating level sensors are not affected by dust, static charge build-up from dielectric powders, or changes in conductivity, temperature, pressure, humidity or moisture content. Tuning-fork style vibration sensors are another alternative. They tend to be less costly, but are prone to material buildup between the tines, =Rotating paddle = Rotating paddle level sensors are a very old and established technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed gear motor that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a flange mounted on the motor contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed from a variety of materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as Perlite, Bentonite or fly ash, special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals. =Admittance- type = An RF admittance level sensor uses a rod probe and RF source to measure the change in admittance. The probe is driven through a shielded coaxial cable to eliminate the effects of changing cable capacitance to ground. When the level changes around the probe, a corresponding change in the dielectric is observed. This changes the admittance of this imperfect capacitor and this change is measured to detect change of level. Point level detection of liquids  Typical systems for point level detection in liquids include magnetic and mechanical floats, pressure sensors, electroconductive sensing or electrostatic (capacitance or inductance) detectors -- and by measurement of a signal's time-of-flight to the fluid surface, through electromagnetic (such as magnetostrictive), ultrasonic, radar or optical sensors.Tank Sensors & Probes, Electronic Sensors, Inc., retrieved August 8, 2018Henry Hopper, \\"A Dozen Ways to Measure Fluid Level and How They Work,\\" December 1, 2018, Sensors Magazine, retrieved August 29 2018 =Magnetic and mechanical float = The principle behind magnetic, mechanical, cable, and other float level sensors often involves the opening or closing of a mechanical switch, either through direct contact with the switch, or magnetic operation of a reed. In other instances, such as magnetostrictive sensors, continuous monitoring is possible using a float principle. With magnetically actuated float sensors, switching occurs when a permanent magnet sealed inside a float rises or falls to the actuation level. With a mechanically actuated float, switching occurs as a result of the movement of a float against a miniature (micro) switch. For both magnetic and mechanical float level sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of float material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity ‚Äì changes that directly affect buoyancy. Float-type sensors can be designed so that a shield protects the float itself from turbulence and wave motion. Float sensors operate well in a wide variety of liquids, including corrosives. When used for organic solvents, however, one will need to verify that these liquids are chemically compatible with the materials used to construct the sensor. Float-style sensors should not be used with high viscosity (thick) liquids, sludge or liquids that adhere to the stem or floats, or materials that contain contaminants such as metal chips; other sensing technologies are better suited for these applications. A special application of float-type sensors is the determination of interface level in oil-water separation systems. Two floats can be used with each float sized to match the specific gravity of the oil on one hand, and the water on the other. Another special application of a stem type float switch is the installation of temperature or pressure sensors to create a multi-parameter sensor. Magnetic float switches are popular for simplicity, dependability and low cost. A variation of magnetic sensing is the \\"Hall effect\\" sensor which utilizes the magnetic sensing of a mechanical gauge's indications. In a typical application, a magnetism-sensitive \\"Hall effect sensor\\" is affixed to a mechanical tank gauge that has a magnetized indicator needle, so as to detect the indicating position of the gauge's needle. The magnetic sensor translates the indicator needle position into an electrical signal, allowing other (usually remote) indication or signalling. =Pneumatic = Pneumatic level sensors are used where hazardous conditions exist, where there is no electric power or its use is restricted, or in applications involving heavy sludge or slurry. As the compression of a column of air against a diaphragm is used to actuate a switch, no process liquid contacts the sensor's moving parts. These sensors are suitable for use with highly viscous liquids such as grease, as well as water-based and corrosive liquids. This has the additional benefit of being a relatively low cost technique for point level monitoring. A variation of this technique is the \\"bubbler\\", which compresses air into a tube to the bottom of the tank, until the pressure increase halts as the air pressure gets high enough to expel air bubbles from the bottom of the tube, overcoming the pressure there. The measurement of the stabilized air pressure indicates the pressure at the bottom of the tank, and, hence, the mass of fluid above. =Conductive = Conductive level sensors are ideal for the point level detection of a wide range of conductive liquids such as water, and is especially well suited for highly corrosive liquids such as caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, ferric chloride, and similar liquids. For those conductive liquids that are corrosive, the sensor‚Äôs electrodes need to be constructed from titanium, Hastelloy B or C, or 316 stainless steel and insulated with spacers, separators or holders of ceramic, polyethylene and Teflon-based materials. Depending on their design, multiple electrodes of differing lengths can be used with one holder. Since corrosive liquids become more aggressive as temperature and pressure increase, these extreme conditions need to be considered when specifying these sensors. Conductive level sensors use a low- voltage, current-limited power source applied across separate electrodes. The power supply is matched to the conductivity of the liquid, with higher voltage versions designed to operate in less conductive (higher resistance) mediums. The power source frequently incorporates some aspect of control, such as high- low or alternating pump control. A conductive liquid contacting both the longest probe (common) and a shorter probe (return) completes a conductive circuit. Conductive sensors are extremely safe because they use low voltages and currents. Since the current and voltage used is inherently small, for personal safety reasons, the technique is also capable of being made \\"Intrinsically Safe\\" to meet international standards for hazardous locations. Conductive probes have the additional benefit of being solid-state devices and are very simple to install and use. In some liquids and applications, maintenance can be an issue. The probe must continue to be conductive. If buildup insulates the probe from the medium, it will stop working properly. A simple inspection of the probe will require an ohmmeter connected across the suspect probe and the ground reference. Typically, in most water and wastewater wells, the well itself with its ladders, pumps and other metal installations, provides a ground return. However, in chemical tanks, and other non-grounded wells, the installer must supply a ground return, typically an earth rod. =State dependent frequency monitor= A microprocessor controlled frequency state change detection method uses a low amplitude signal generated on multiple sensor probes of differing lengths. Each probe has a frequency separate from all other probes in the array and independently changes state when touched by water. The state change of the frequency on each probe is monitored by a microprocessor which can perform multiple water level control functions. A strength of state dependent frequency monitoring is long term stability of the sensing probes. The signal strength is not sufficient to cause fouling, degradation, or deterioration of the sensors due to electrolysis in contaminated water. Sensor cleaning requirements are minimal or eliminated. Use of multiple sensing rods of different length allows the user to intuitively set up control switches at various water heights. The microprocessor in a state dependent frequency monitor can actuate valves and/or large pumps with very low power consumption. Multiple switch controls can be built in to small package while providing complex, application specific functionality using the microprocessor. Low power consumption of the controls is consistent across large and small field applications. This universal technology is used in applications with wide-ranging liquid quality. Sensors for both point level detection or continuous monitoring  =Ultrasonic = Ultrasonic level sensor used in a water treatment plant Ultrasonic level sensors are used for non-contact level sensing of highly viscous liquids, as well as bulk solids. They are also widely used in water treatment applications for pump control and open channel flow measurement. The sensors emit high frequency (20 kHz to 200 kHz) acoustic waves that are reflected back to and detected by the emitting transducer. Ultrasonic level sensors are also affected by the changing speed of sound due to moisture, temperature, and pressures. Correction factors can be applied to the level measurement to improve the accuracy of measurement. Turbulence, foam, steam, chemical mists (vapors), and changes in the concentration of the process material also affect the ultrasonic sensor‚Äôs response. Turbulence and foam prevent the sound wave from being properly reflected to the sensor; steam and chemical mists and vapors distort or absorb the sound wave; and variations in concentration cause changes in the amount of energy in the sound wave that is reflected back to the sensor. Stilling wells and waveguides are used to prevent errors caused by these factors. Proper mounting of the transducer is required to ensure the best response to reflected sound. In addition, the hopper, bin, or tank should be relatively free of obstacles such as weldments, brackets, or ladders to minimise false returns and the resulting erroneous response, although most modern systems have sufficiently \\"intelligent\\" echo processing to make engineering changes largely unnecessary except where an intrusion blocks the \\"line of sight\\" of the transducer to the target. Since the ultrasonic transducer is used both for transmitting and receiving the acoustic energy, it is subject to a period of mechanical vibration known as \\"ringing\\". This vibration must attenuate (stop) before the echoed signal can be processed. The net result is a distance from the face of the transducer that is blind and cannot detect an object. It is known as the \\"blanking zone\\", typically 150 mm to 1 m, depending on the range of the transducer. The requirement for electronic signal processing circuitry can be used to make the ultrasonic sensor an intelligent device. Ultrasonic sensors can be designed to provide point level control, continuous monitoring or both. Due to the presence of a microprocessor and relatively low power consumption, there is also the capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal, remote wireless monitoring or plant network communications. The ultrasonic sensor enjoys wide popularity due to the powerful mix of low price and high functionality. =Capacitance = leftCapacitance level sensors excel in sensing the presence of a wide variety of solids, aqueous and organic liquids, and slurries. The technique is frequently referred to as RF for the radio frequency signals applied to the capacitance circuit. The sensors can be designed to sense material with dielectric constants as low as 1.1 (coke and fly ash) and as high as 88 (water) or more. Sludges and slurries such as dehydrated cake and sewage slurry (dielectric constant approx. 50) and liquid chemicals such as quicklime (dielectric constant approx. 90) can also be sensed. Dual-probe capacitance level sensors can also be used to sense the interface between two immiscible liquids with substantially different dielectric constants, providing a solid state alternative to the aforementioned magnetic float switch for the \\"oil-water interface\\" application. Since capacitance level sensors are electronic devices, phase modulation and the use of higher frequencies makes the sensor suitable for applications in which dielectric constants are similar. The sensor contains no moving parts, is rugged, simple to use, and easy to clean, and can be designed for high temperature and pressure applications. A danger exists from build-up and discharge of a high-voltage static charge that results from the rubbing and movement of low dielectric materials, but this danger can be eliminated with proper design and grounding. Appropriate choice of probe materials reduces or eliminates problems caused by abrasion and corrosion. Point level sensing of adhesives and high-viscosity materials such as oil and grease can result in the build-up of material on the probe; however, this can be minimized by using a self-tuning sensor. For liquids prone to foaming and applications prone to splashing or turbulence, capacitance level sensors can be designed with splashguards or stilling wells, among other devices. A significant limitation for capacitance probes is in tall bins used for storing bulk solids. The requirement for a conductive probe that extends to the bottom of the measured range is problematic. Long conductive cable probes (20 to 50 meters long), suspended into the bin or silo, are subject to tremendous mechanical tension due to the weight of the bulk powder in the silo and the friction applied to the cable. Such installations will frequently result in a cable breakage. =Optical interface = Optical sensors are used for point level sensing of sediments, liquids with suspended solids, and liquid-liquid interfaces. These sensors sense the decrease or change in transmission of infrared light emitted from an infrared diode (LED). With the proper choice of construction materials and mounting location, these sensors can be used with aqueous, organic, and corrosive liquids. A common application of economical infrared-based optical interface point level sensors is detecting the sludge/water interface in settling ponds. By using pulse modulation techniques and a high power infrared diode, one can eliminate interference from ambient light, operate the LED at a higher gain, and lessen the effects of build-up on the probe. An alternate approach for continuous optical level sensing involves the use of a laser. Laser light is more concentrated and therefore is more capable of penetrating dusty or steamy environments. Laser light will reflect off most solid, liquid surfaces. The time of flight can be measured with precise timing circuitry, to determine the range or distance of the surface from the sensor. Lasers remain limited in use in industrial applications due to cost, and concern for maintenance. The optics must be frequently cleaned to maintain performance. =Microwave = Microwave sensors are ideal for use in moist, vaporous, and dusty environments as well as in applications in which temperatures and pressures vary. Microwaves (also frequently described as RADAR), will penetrate temperature and vapor layers that may cause problems for other techniques, such as ultrasonic. Microwaves are electromagnetic energy and therefore do not require air molecules to transmit the energy making them useful in vacuums. Microwaves, as electromagnetic energy, are reflected by objects with high conductive properties, like metal and conductive water. Alternately, they are absorbed in various degrees by 'low dielectric' or insulating mediums such as plastics, glass, paper, many powders and food stuffs and other solids. Microwave sensors are executed in a wide variety of techniques. Two basic signal processing techniques are applied, each offering its own advantages: Pulsed or Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) which is a measurement of time of flight divided by the speed of light, similar to ultrasonic level sensors, and Doppler systems employing FMCW techniques. Just as with ultrasonic level sensors, microwave sensors are executed at various frequencies, from 1 GHz to 60 GHz. Generally, the higher the frequency, the more accurate, and the more costly. Microwave is executed non-contact technique or guided. The first is done by monitoring a microwave signal that is transmitted through free space (including vacuum) and reflected back, or can be executed as a \\"radar on a wire\\" technique, generally known as Guided Wave Radar or Guided Microwave Radar. In the latter technique, performance generally improves in powders and low dielectric media that are not good reflectors of electromagnetic energy transmitted through a void (as in non-contact microwave sensors). But with the guided technique the same mechanical constraints exist that cause problems for the capacitance (RF) techniques mentioned previously by having a probe in the vessel. Non contact microwave-based radar sensors are able to see through low conductivity 'microwave-transparent' (non-conductive) glass/plastic windows or vessel walls through which the microwave beam can be passed and measure a 'microwave reflective' (conductive) liquid inside (in the same way as to use a plastic bowl in a microwave oven). They are also largely unaffected by high temperature, pressure, vacuum or vibration. As these sensors do not require physical contact with the process material, so the transmitter /receiver can be mounted a safe distance above/from the process, even with an antenna extension of several metres to reduce temperature, yet still respond to the changes in level or distance changes e.g. they are ideal for measurement of molten metal products at over 1200 ¬∞C. Microwave transmitters also offer the same key advantage of ultrasonics: the presence of a microprocessor to process the signal, provide numerous monitoring, controls, communications, setup and diagnostic capabilities and are independent of changing density, viscosity and electrical properties. Additionally, they solve some of the application limitations of ultrasonics: operation in high pressure and vacuum, high temperatures, dust, temperature and vapor layers. Guided Wave Radars can measure in narrow confined spaces very successfully, as the guide element ensures correct transmission to and from the measured liquid. Applications such as inside stilling tubes or external bridles or cages, offer an excellent alternative to float or displacement devices, as they remove any moving parts or linkages and are unaffected by density changes or build up. They are also excellent with very low microwave reflectivity products like liquid gasses (LNG, LPG, Ammonia) which are stored at low temperatures/high pressures, although care needs to be taken on sealing arrangements and hazardous area approvals. On bulk solids and powders, GWR offers a great alternative to radar or ultrasonic sensors, but some care needs to be taken over cable wear and roof loading by the product movement. One perceived major disadvantage of microwave or radar techniques for level monitoring is the relatively high price of such sensors and complex set up. However, price has reduced significantly over the last few years, to match those of longer range ultrasonics, with simplified set up of both techniques also improving ease of use. Continuous level measurement of liquids  =Magnetostrictive = Magnetostrictive level sensors are similar to float type sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float travels up and down a stem in which a magnetostrictive wire is sealed. Ideal for high-accuracy, continuous level measurement of a wide variety of liquids in storage and shipping containers, these sensors require the proper choice of float based on the specific gravity of the liquid. When choosing float and stem materials for magnetostrictive level sensors, the same guidelines described for magnetic and mechanical float level sensors apply. Magnetostrictive level and position devices charge the magnetostrictive wire with electric current, when the field intersects the floats' magnetic field a mechanical twist or pulse is generated, this travels back down the wire at the speed of sound, like ultrasound or radar the distance is measured by time of flight from pulse to return pulse registry. the time of flight corresponds to the distance from the sensor detecting the return pulse. Because of the accuracy possible with the magnetostrictive technique, it is popular for \\"custody-transfer\\" applications. It can be permitted by an agency of weights and measures for conducting commercial transactions. It is also frequently applied on magnetic sight gages. In this variation, the magnet is installed in a float that travels inside a gage glass or tube. The magnet operates on the sensor which is mounted externally on the gage. Boilers and other high temperature or pressure applications take advantage of this performance quality =Resistive chain= Resistive chain level sensors are similar to magnetic float level sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float moves up and down a stem in which closely spaced switches and resistors are sealed. When the switches are closed, the resistance is summed and converted to current or voltage signals that are proportional to the level of the liquid. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. With the proper choice of two floats, resistive chain level sensors can also be used to monitor for the presence of an interface between two immiscible liquids whose specific gravities are more than 0.6, but differ by as little as 0.1 unit. =Magnetoresistive = Magneto Resistive Level Sensor Magnetoresistance float level sensors are similar to float level sensors however a permanent magnet pair is sealed inside the float arm pivot. As the float moves up the motion and location are transmitted as the angular position of the magnetic field. This detection system is highly accurate down to 0.02¬∞ of motion. The field compass location provides a physical location of the float position. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy of the float. The electronic monitoring system does not come in contact with the fluid and is considered Intrinsic safety: or explosion proof. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, vehicle, aviation, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. Due to the presence of a microprocessor and low power consumption, there is also capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal. =Hydrostatic pressure= Hydrostatic pressure level sensors are submersible or externally mounted pressure sensors suitable for measuring the level of corrosive liquids in deep tanks or water in reservoirs. Typically, fluid level is determined by the pressure at the bottom of the fluid containment (tank or reservoir); the pressure at the bottom, adjusted for the density / specific gravity of the fluid, indicates the depth of the fluid. For these sensors, using chemically compatible materials is important to assure proper performance. Sensors are commercially available from 10 mbar to 1000 bar. Since these sensors sense increasing pressure with depth and because the specific gravities of liquids are different, the sensor must be properly calibrated for each application. In addition, large variations in temperature cause changes in specific gravity that should be accounted for when the pressure is converted to level. These sensors can be designed to keep the diaphragm free of contamination or build- up, thus ensuring proper operation and accurate hydrostatic pressure level measurements. For use in open air applications, where the sensor cannot be mounted to the bottom of the tank or pipe thereof, a special version of the hydrostatic pressure level sensor, a level probe, can be suspended from a cable into the tank to the bottom point that is to be measured. The sensor must be specially designed to seal the electronics from the liquid environment. In tanks with a small head pressure (less than 100 INWC), it is very important to vent the back of the sensor gauge to atmospheric pressure. Otherwise, normal changes in barometric pressure will introduce large error in the sensor output signal. In addition, most sensors need to be compensated for temperature changes in the fluid. =Air bubbler = An air bubbler system uses a tube with an opening below the surface of the liquid level. A fixed flow of air is passed through the tube. Pressure in the tube is proportional to the depth (and density) of the liquid over the outlet of the tube. Air bubbler systems contain no moving parts, making them suitable for measuring the level of sewage, drainage water, sewage sludge, night soil, or water with large quantities of suspended solids. The only part of the sensor that contacts the liquid is a bubble tube which is chemically compatible with the material whose level is to be measured. Since the point of measurement has no electrical components, the technique is a good choice for classified \\"Hazardous Areas\\". The control portion of the system can be located safely away, with the pneumatic plumbing isolating the hazardous from the safe area. Air bubbler systems are a good choice for open tanks at atmospheric pressure and can be built so that high-pressure air is routed through a bypass valve to dislodge solids that may clog the bubble tube. The technique is inherently \\"self-cleaning\\". It is highly recommended for liquid level measurement applications where ultrasonic, float or microwave techniques have proved undependable. The system will require constant supply of air during measurement. The end of the tube should be above certain height to avoid sludge from clogging the tube. =Gamma ray= A nuclear level gauge or gamma ray gauge measures level by the attenuation of gamma rays passing through a process vessel. The technique is used to regulate the level of molten steel in a continuous casting process of steelmaking. The water-cooled mold is arranged with a source of radiation, such as cobalt-60 or caesium-137, on one side and a sensitive detector such as a scintillation counter on the other. As the level of molten steel rises in the mold, less of the gamma radiation is detected by the sensor. The technique allows non-contact measurement where the heat of the molten metal makes contact techniques and even many non-contact techniques impractical.

About RMITV is a student run media production house based within RMIT University, with the majority of its funding granted by RMIT University Student Union (RUSU). RMITV is dedicated to providing hands on television experience to students. RMITV also produces content to be broadcast, most commonly on C31 Melbourne and have helped many students find their way to careers in the television industry. Although based at RMIT University in Melbourne, they also work to provide opportunities to members of the local community wanting to get involved in television production. Logo Designed by RMITV member Nic Mason in the early 2000s, the \\"R\\" and \\"M\\" in RMITV's logo are based on the series of classification marks from the OFLC used to designate \\"Restricted\\" and \\"Mature\\" broadcast content and the \\"I\\" and \\"TV\\" are based on the 'General' (G) and 'Parental Guidance' (PG) classification marks but making use of different letters and antennas on the TV to signify television History RMITV is one of the oldest community television organisations in Australia, having been involved in lobbying the government for community access to the television spectrum. It transmitted its first test broadcast in 1987. Early on RMITV struggled with licences for television spectrum. After originally lobbying for a public licence, similar to those seen in the American public television sector, RMITV was knocked back as public licences are not available in Australia. They were then granted a licence to broadcast to private audiences in a 10 km radius of the RMIT City Campus. The license was granted on the 09/08/1987. A week after a Channel 10 news report by Mal Walden about RMITV's upcoming open day 1987 broadcast the licence was cancelled. The first licence was a General Licence Class D (Section 24). The Licence number was 211744/2. The callsign was VH3BVK. RMITV was also responsible for broadcasting ETV, a closed-circuit television system operated at the RMIT Campus in previous years. The government encouraged Melbourne's many aspirant community television broadcasters to form an umbrella organisation to apply for a broadcasting license, and so RMITV became a founding member of the Melbourne Community Television Consortium; the license holder for Melbourne's Channel 31. RMITV has a long history of successful producers and practitioners moving into professional employment within the Australian television industry. Most notable alumni include: Waleed Aly (The Project), Rove McManus (Roving Enterprises), Hamish and Andy (Fox FM), Shona Devlin (JTV ‚Äì Triple J), Tommy Little (This Week Live), Dave Thornton (This Week Live), Peter Helliar and many more. RMITV has also had many crew members go on to work at the ABC, Network 10, Videoworks and Staging Connections. RMITV's Productions are not only limited to C31, many of RMITV's productions air on community stations all around Australia. For example, Live on Bowen (2012‚Äì2015) which were broadcast on C31, Face Television - Sky Channel 083 (New Zealand), WTV (Perth) and 31 Digital (South East Queensland), The Inquiry (2009-2010), In Pit Lane (1998‚Äìpresent) and 31 Questions (2012‚Äì2014). Throughout its time RMITV has produced some of the most well known programs on Australian community television, including: The Loft Live, Under Melbourne Tonight, Chartbusting 80's, Raucous, Dawns Crack, PLUCK, Studio A, The Leak and countless outside broadcasts. Mid-2015 spawned a webseries collaboration between RMITV and Catalyst, RMIT's Student Magazine, entitled \\"Politics at the Belleville\\". Based on the podcast \\"Politics on the Couch\\" the program was hosted by the same talent and was released every Friday afternoon.

The order of trumps has the Jack high. Game Any number from two to eight people may play. If an even number, partners are cut for; if odd, each plays for himself. An odd number of players sit as they like; four players sit as at whist; six playing in two sides sit so that no two partners shall be next each other; six playing three sides sit so that two opponents shall divide each pair; eight are arranged in alternate pairs. When five or seven play, the six of spades is usually omitted; when eight play, the four sixes are thrown out. =Object= The aim of the game is to win tricks, specially those containing any of the top five trumps. The rank of the cards and point value goes as follows: Trump J = 11 Ace = 4 King = 3 Queen = 2 Ten = 10 =Play= After cutting, the cards are dealt according to the number of players. The last card is turned up for the trump. The eldest hand leads any card he chooses and all must follow suit if able, the penalty for a revoke being the loss of the game. The tricks are not kept separate but gathered in by one player for his side. At the end Of the deal there are six hands of six cards on the table. The players first play out the first two hands, next the second two and finally the last two, the trump card remaining on the table until the first four hands are played out. The game is 41 points, the object of play being to win the cards which have a special value. These are, with their values: jack of trumps 11, ace of trumps 4, king of trumps 3, queen of trumps 2, ten of trumps 10. All other cards have no counting value. As the ten can be taken by any other honor the object is to catch the ten.

Introduction  The Chinese warlord Zhang Zuolin introduced tanks to China. Surprised during the Northern Expedition by Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army, he bought several Renault FT tanks armed with 37 mm guns from France in 1927. It is uncertain how these tanks were used in combat, but they were eventually captured by the Japanese and the Chinese Nationalists. The tanks captured by the Japanese army were deployed in the Kwantung Army and later used during the Mukden Incident. The Nationalists in the meantime also bought 36 FTs. However, they saw no action but were used mainly for training. Also about 6 or 10 Renault UE light armoured carriers armed with Browning MG were bought in France. Additions Vickers A4E12 amphibious tank. Vickers Carden Lloyd A4E12 amphibious tanks. At the beginning of the war in 1937 the armour were organized in three armoured battalions, equipped with tanks and armoured cars from various countries. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in earnest, the 1st and 2nd Armored Battalions participated in the Second Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Nanking and were more or less completely destroyed by the Japanese forces. Many of the tanks were captured by the Japanese. By 1938 nearly half of China's armor was either captured or destroyed as out of the 96 tanks they started with, only 48 remained. China, at that time, had German advisors, but these were withdrawn as German relations with Japan warmed. In early 1938, the Japanese government had demanded that the German government withdraw all German advisers from China. Given the closer relations between the two nations, Hitler agreed and soon after they left China. After the Germans left, the Soviet Union started to support the Nationalists. The National Revolutionary Army facing Japanese forces had only the small number of armoured vehicles and mechanised troops formed into the three armoured battalions to defend a large front. In August 1937, Chiang Kai-shek's government negotiated with the Soviet government for military aid for the War of China's Resistance Against Japan (1937‚Äì1945) during a signing of a Treaty of Non-Aggression between the Republic of China and the Soviet Union. The Soviets came in and began to provide Soviet advisers and Soviet tanks arrived in China for the first time in March 1938.China After these battalions were mostly destroyed in the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing, new tanks, armoured cars and trucks from the Soviet Union and Italy made it possible to create the only mechanized division in the army. The Soviet advisers organized the new mechanised unit in China, the 200th Division, which consisted of one tank regiment and one motorised infantry regiment. T-26 tanks of Chinese Nationalist Army during WW2 The USSR sold 82 T-26 mod. 1933 tanks to China as Russia was wary of having Japan on its back door. These tanks were shipped to Guangzhou harbour in the spring of 1938, and used to set up the first tank regiment of the 200th Infantry Division of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, the only motorized infantry formation in the Chinese Army at that time. The 200th Infantry Division was a mechanized division consisting of four regiments, including a tank regiment equipped with the T-26s, an armoured car regiment, a mechanized infantry regiment, and an artillery regiment. Chinese tank crews were trained under the supervision of Soviet specialists. The 200th Division was set up as the first mechanised division in the National Revolutionary Army by General Du Yuming, who was also its first commander. The tank regiments had 70 T-26, 4 BT-5, 20 ( 92? ) CV-35 tanks. The armoured car regiment had around 50 BA armoured cars and 12 ( 18? ) Leichter Panzersp√§hwagen (Sd.Kfz. 221) armoured cars. The tank regiment consisted of four tank battalions. Each tank battalion had three tank companies. The tank regiments had approximately 200 armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs). The Nationalist government bought 88 T-26 tanks and BA-10 and BA-20 armoured cars. These AFVs and remaining German AFVs were deployed in the 200th Division and the division finally saw action in late 1938. Its first action was against the 14th Division in the Battle of Lanfeng. Following the division's combat in the Battle of Lanfeng and in operations afterward until September 1938 the division's original subordinate mechanized units were placed under direct command of the 11th Army, and the division was reorganized. It inflicted the devastating defeat upon the Japanese army at the Battle of Kunlun Pass. It suffered heavy losses after the battle at Kunlun Pass in an offensive against Batang, losing nearly two thirds of its strength and was rebuilt and reorganized. With the Soviet and Japanese non-aggression pact signing, this help from the Soviets went out the window and China started searching for allies. After signing the nonaggression pact with Germany and defeating the Kwangtung Army at Khalkin Gol, Russia started to withdraw its help from China. T16 light tank Chinese troops on Stuart tanks Soon relations were made with the USA who only slowly began to (officially) provide help and even more when America entered the war. More than 600 of the T16 CTMS tanks were supposed to be delivered to China under Lend-Lease after Pearl Harbor, the logistical difficulty and its obsolete design compelled the Chinese to reject the offer. Later 233 U.S. M2A4 light tanks were acquired by the Nationalists along with some 48 M3A3, M5A1 Stuart tanks in Lend/Lease from the USA in 1943, and 35 M4A4 Sherman tanks were acquired under the United States Military Assistance Program between 1943 and 1944. M4 Shermans. Upon the American entry into the war in 1941, it began to supply China with AFVs which the Soviets were unable to provide. M3 Stuarts and M4 Shermans trickled in through Burma and formed part of the several well-equipped, well-trained armies that the Nationalists could deploy. These units were responsible for stopping numerous Japanese attacks during the later phases of the war. The 200th Division also saw action in the Burma Theatre under Joseph Stilwell; it participated in the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road in 1942 in the Burma campaign. The 200th Division distinguished itself in fighting in the Battle of Toungoo, and Battle of Hopong - Taunggyi but then suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Hsipaw-Mogok Highway near the end of the campaign as it was attempting to retreat to China. After World War II, the remaining Chinese T-26 tanks equipped the First Armoured Regiment of the Army of the Chinese Kuomintang government, which saw service in East China during the Chinese Civil War (1946‚Äì1950) where several T-26 tanks were destroyed or captured by the People's Liberation Army during the Huaihai Campaign in 1949.

It is situated on the southern ascent to the central plateau (the Campeda) of this part of Sardinia, at the junction of narrow-gauge lines branching from the main railroad line running east to Nuoro and west to Bosa. The district, especially the Campeda, is well suited for grazing and horse and cattle breeding, which is carried on to a considerable extent. History Macomer, known to the Greek geographer Ptolemy as \\"Macopsissa,\\" has been inhabited since antiquity. In 1478 was the scene of the historical battle between the Sardinians and the Aragonese, which ended the independence of Sardinia. In 1767, under the Kingdom of Sardinia, it became the capital of the Marquisate of Marghine. The Marquisate included the nearby villages of Birori, Bolotana, Borore, Bortigali, Dualchi, Lei, Mulargia, Noragugume and Silanus. In 1949, a statue called The Venus of Macomer was discovered in a cave located in \\"Marras\\" area, in a gorge of the river S'Adde. The artifact depicts a Goddess Mother dating back to the Palaeolithic period. It is about high and was built with local basalt. It is currently kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Cagliari. Nowadays, Macomer is a destination for tourists who want to admire the beautiful landscape around the city. The archaeological site of Tamuli is one of the attractions of Macomer. Main sights The region is richer in the bronze-age towers known as nuraghi than any other part of Sardinia. The old parish church of San Pantaleone has three Roman mile-stones in front of it, belonging to the Roman high-road from Carales to Turris Libisonis. A modern road now follows the ancient one.

Early career  Xie Xuan was a scion of the influential Xie clan of Chen. His father Xie Yi (Ë¨ùÂ•ï) ,was the elder brother of the Jin prime minister Xie An. Xie Xuan's sister Xie Daoyun (Ë¨ùÈÅìÈüû) was known for her literary talent and quick wit.Book of Jin, vol. 96. Early in his career, both Xie Xuan and his uncle Xie An served on staff of the paramount general Huan Wen. Huan Wen greatly prized Xie Xuan's ability, and once commented, with regard to him and his colleague Wang Xun (ÁéãÁè£), both of whom served as his secretaries: :By age 40, Mr. Xie will possess a great general's banner and staff, and Mr. Wang will be a prime minister even while his hair is black. Both are uncommon talents. After Huan Wen's death in 373, Xie Xuan initially served on the staff of Huan Wen's brother Huan Huo. In 377, when the imperial government was looking for a general capable of defending the northeastern border (modern Jiangsu) against Former Qin, Xie An, against the usual custom of not recommending one's own clan members, recommended him. The official Chi Chao, who ordinarily feuded with Xie An on nearly all matters, immediately remarked, \\"Xie An, in his good judgment, made an uncommonly good move against public sentiment, and Xie Xuan would surely not fail his expectations.\\" Chi made these remarks based on the time when he also served on Huan Wen's staff and saw Xie Xuan's abilities. Xie Xuan recruited elite soldiers, and among the ones that joined him was Liu Laozhi (ÂäâÁâ¢‰πã), who in later campaigns served as his assistant and forward commander. Eventually, Xie put together an army that was the most elite of the Jin forces, known as the Beifu Forces (ÂåóÂ∫úÂÖµ). His army first distinguished itself in 378, when Former Qin forces made simultaneous attacks on the important Jin cities Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩ, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), Weixing (È≠èËàà, in modern Ankang, Shaanxi), and Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). Xiangyang and Weixing fell to Former Qin, as did Pengcheng, but Xie, charged with relieving Pengcheng, made a fierce counterattack in 379, defeating the Former Qin generals Ju Nan (‰ø±Èõ£) and Peng Chao (ÂΩ≠Ë∂Ö) and recapturing Pengcheng. This was the first major victory that Jin had over Former Qin in decades, and it was a major morale booster.  The Battle of Fei River  In 383, as Former Qin launched a major assault with intent to destroy Jin once and for all, Xie Xuan and his Beifu Force was sent to the frontline, reporting to the command of his uncle Xie Shi (Ë¨ùÁü≥). Xie Shi, initially intimidated by the much larger Former Qin force, considered merely trying to block Former Qin progress without major engagement, but after he was advised otherwise by the Former Qin ambassador Zhu Xu -- a Jin general who was captured by Former Qin in 379 but who secretly remained loyal to Jin -- and chose to engage Former Qin forward troops that arrived first. Xie Xuan, charged with engaging Former Qin forces, along with Liu Laozhi, dealt them minor defeats, reducing their morale. When Former Qin troops gradually arrived, the Former Qin and Jin forces became stalemated across the Fei River (which no longer exists but probably flowed through Lu'an, Anhui, near the Huai River). Xie Xuan sent a message to the Former Qin commanding general Fu Rong (Fu JiƒÅn's brother) with a proposal -- to have Fu Rong order his troops to retreat slightly to allow the Jin forces across, so the armies could engage. Fu Rong, after discussing with Fu JiƒÅn, agreed, and ordered a retreat. However, once the Former Qin troops went into retreat, it panicked, and as Fu Rong tried to calm his troops down, his horse suddenly fell, and he was killed by Jin soldiers. Once that happened, Xie Xuan and other generals, Xie Yan (Ë¨ùÁê∞) and Huan Yi fiercely attacked Former Qin troops, which then completely collapsed. Former Qin would face major rebellions starting in 384 that eventually led to its disintegration and would not again pose a threat to Jin.  After the Battle of Fei River  Due to his achievements at the Battle of Fei River, Xie Xuan was created the Duke of Kangle. When the major general Huan Chong died in 384, initially Xie Xuan was to succeed him, but Xie An thought the Huan clan might be unhappy about yielding Huan Chong's command to others, so divided Huan Chong's domain into three and distributed them to members of the Huan clan. Later that year, however, Xie Xuan was put in charge of a force targeting the recovery of central China, along with Huan Shiqian. He quickly recovered most of the territory south of the Yellow River on Jin's behalf, and, in an odd case of enemies quickly turning allies, briefly relieved Fu JiƒÅn's son Fu Pi, who was defending Yecheng against rebels led by Murong Chui, who had just founded Later Yan. Xie apparently considered further operations to try to seize territory north of the Yellow River, but as Murong Chui quickly entrenched himself north of the Yellow River, it became clear it would be difficult to do so. In 386, after the generals Zhai Liao and Zhang Yuan (ÂºµÈ°ò) rebelled, in light of popular opinion that believed that the troops were being worn out, Xie abandoned the plans entirely, and indeed moved his headquarters from Pengcheng south to Huaiyin (Ê∑ÆÈô∞, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), although Jin continued to hold most of the territory south of the Yellow River. After that point, it appeared that Xie suffered a series of illnesses that made it impossible for him to conduct any further campaigns and which also made him to repeatedly try to resign his command. Eventually, he was made the governor of Kuaiji Commandery along the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay. The post was important, but almost entirely civilian. He died in 388 while still serving as the governor of Kuaiji.  References  * Book of Jin, vol. 79.

Findings  Many Aboriginal artefacts were multi-purpose, for example boomerangs could be used: *as hunting or fighting weapons; *for digging; *as cutting knives; *for making fire by friction; and *as percussion instruments for making music. =Weapons= Aboriginal people used several different types of weapons including shields, spears (also known as hielaman), Spear-throwers, boomerangs and clubs. Peoples from different regions used different weapons. Some peoples, for example, would fight with boomerangs and shields, whereas in another region they would fight with clubs. Not all weapons were for warfare; many were used primarily for hunting game. Weapons were of different styles in different areas. For example, a shield from Central Australia is very different from a shield from North Queensland. =Everyday items= Everyday items include digging sticks, stone axes, coolamons and dilly bags.

He performed with various projects until joining Marc Terenzi in a new band Terenzi in 2008. Early life Michael Johnson began dancing at the age of 4. He eventually began to dance professionally, winning many awards and scholarships. He also danced for many Disney and television specials growing up. At the age of 8, he began to study voice and performing in musical theatre. At the age of 13, he won the titles \\"Mr. Dance of Florida\\" and \\"Teen Dancer of the year\\". Natural Many publicity stories exist as to how Natural was started, but the most likely one is that in 1999, Marc Terenzi met a man named Patrick King at a party. Michael was friends with Patrick King, and Marc was friends with a man named Ben Bledsoe. After many lineup changes, the men added Michael 'J' Horn to their lineup and decided to call themselves Natural The boys tried to get signed with many major labels but were turned down despite a huge local following in Orlando, FL. One day as they rehearsed at Transcontinental Studios, boyband king Lou Pearlman noticed them and liked their act. Soon after, they were signed with Transcontinental Records. Lou Pearlman had a new twist for his old boyband vision: not only would they dance, sing, and look cute, but they would also play instruments. Many of the other members already played various instruments but Michael had not. It was through this arrangement that he started learning percussion. By the time the first single was out, Michael was officially the drummer of the group and played well enough to be recorded on the first album 'Keep it Natural'. Lou Pearlman spared no expense and promoted the guys' first single with Claire's and a tour with the Monkees. However, American fame came slowly, and the band soon traveled to Germany, where they produced songs targeted to young women. to conquer little girl's hearts. They had much success with such hits as \\"Put Your Arms Around Me\\", \\"Will It Ever\\", and \\"Runaway\\". In the summer of 2002 Marc Terenzi met German pop star Sarah Connor at a music festival, and the two soon began dating. Their relationship continued despite Lou Pearlman's strict prohibitions of facial hair, of piercings or tattoos, and of girlfriends. Meanwhile Michael was having his own trouble with Lou's rules. He was dubbed the 'bad boy' in the image of the group but wasn't allowed to do anything remotely 'unwholesome'. Although he had his lip piercing, Lou caused him to remove the jewelry. On top of this he had to constantly have his hair in blue spikes ‚Äì an image he kept until the group dismembered. In the summer of 2003 Sarah Connor, became pregnant and the couple became engaged. Around this time, Natural was coming back from a hiatus and releasing a single 'What if' from their 2nd album It's Only Natural. Lou Pearlman wasn't happy with the news and wanted Marc kicked out of Natural and replaced with someone new. The other members (except Patrick King) were not thrilled with this and decided to break Natural up. They finished the tour and Michael was left to a new phase in life. Life after Natural Once Natural disbanded Michael wished to remain close to his now former band members. He was asked to stay with the 'New Natural', which also would be run by Pearlman under the same format as the previous edition. Although Patrick King had already agreed to this, Michael decided against the arrangement after a period of time. After turning down the idea of staying in the 'New Natural' Michael got word that Marc Terenzi and Mike Castonguay (former producer and musical director for Natural) were forming a band named Jaded Rose with a third man named Paul Rippee. But soon musical disagreements led to the band's dismemberment: Marc Terenzi wanted to continue to make pop rock songs, while the other members wanted to do something more pure rock. From this situation Jaded Rose disbanded despite the offers of a reality TV show in Germany and a record deal. Marc Terenzi kept with the pop rock style and the rest of the members went off to form Lukewarm Freeda. Mike Castonguay and Michael wrote for the next four months and wrote songs such as Little Miss Get Around (which was featured on Veronica Mars) and Downtown Love which was featured in the movie I'm Through With White Girls. Lukewarm Freeda was a more hard edged punk blues band. The band did some shows in Los Angeles, Nashville and Orlando with the addition of Paul Rippee as a touring bassist. Soon, Michael and Mike relocated to Los Angeles, where they worked together with several bands in the area. Work with other bands Michael continues to drum with Lukewarm Freeda as well as other bands including 'In for the Kill' and Capra. In 2005 he formed his own label 'Blue Suede Records'. =2008: Terenzi= On May 7, 2008, it was announced on Marc Terenzi's official Myspace that he and Johnson had formed a new band alongside Benny Richter, \\" It is true that I am forming a new band.

Agassi competed in the Australian Open this season for the first time in his career. He would go on to win three more in 2000, 2001, and 2003. A memorable moment occurred in the quarterfinal match between Sampras and Jim Courier. Sampras had fought back from a 2-sets down deficit to tie it at 2‚Äì2. Shortly after winning the first game of the fifth set, Sampras was overcome with grief over his then-coach, Tim Gullikson. Gullikson had suffered several seizures while touring with Sampras in Europe in late 1994. Gullikson insisted on accompanying Sampras to the 1995 Australian Open, but shortly before Sampras' quarter final match against Courier, Gullikson had collapsed during a practice session after suffering another seizure, with tests proving inconclusive at Epworth Hospital and being flown home to Chicago for further tests. During the fifth set of his quarter final, Sampras retired to his chair and broke down in tears. When he returned to the game, he found it difficult to continue and Courier offered to finish the match the next day. Sampras declined and was able to close out the match.

It is situated in Valsesia, at above sea level and some north-northeast of Vercelli and northwest of Novara. Once called Varade, it is divided in two boroughs (Varallo Vecchia and Varallo Nuova) by the Mastallone stream. In 1971, Varallo was awarded the Golden Medal for Military Valor for the deeds of its population against the German occupation in the late stages of World War II. Geography The valley of the Sesia is very narrow at this point as it nears its source. Varallo lies on the left bank where the Mastallone flows into the Sesia. The town is surrounded by the foothills of the Alps and is not far from the Monte Rosa, which is visible from the surrounding hills.

About above the town the Sacro Monte di Varallo is one of the most famous Piedmontese pilgrimage sites, and the oldest of the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy which were inscribed by UNESCO in the World Heritage List in 2003. The environs are composed of winding paths leading past 45 chapel-like enclosures containing groups of life-size painted terra-cotta figures with backgrounds in fresco (by Gaudenzio Ferrari and others). The tableaux represent scenes mainly from the life of Jesus. The array was initiated by a Franciscan, Bernardino Caimi, who aimed to reproduce locally images of the passion as a goal of pilgrims. The main pilgrimage church was built by Pellegrino Tibaldi after 1578. In the works mentioned Ferrari's whole development may be traced. In the frazione of Arboerio are the old church of Saints Quirico and Giulitta, with a 17th- century polyptych and an altar of the Madonna del Rosario, and the Villa Eremo.

The lyrics describe a sinner attempting to hide from divine justice on Judgment Day. It was recorded in the 1950s by Les Baxter, the Swan Silvertones, the Weavers and others, before Nina Simone recorded an extended version in 1965. 1950s recordings The earliest recording of the song to bear the title \\"Sinner Man\\" was by the Les Baxter Orchestra in 1956, as the B-side of the Capitol Records single \\"Tango of the Drums\\". The lead vocal was by folk singer Will Holt, who shared the credit for writing the song with Baxter. However, the song clearly bears a close resemblance, in both melody and lyrics, to \\"On the Judgement Day\\", which was recorded by gospel group The Sensational Nightingales in 1954 and released the following year on the Peacock label. The writing of The Sensational Nightingales' song was credited to two of the group's singers, Julius Cheeks and Ernest James. Some of the lyrics in \\"Sinner Man\\", including \\"The rock cried out, 'No hiding place'\\", appear to derive from those in the spiritual, \\"No Hiding Place Down Here\\", recorded in 1928 by the Old South Quartette. A version of \\"Sinner Man\\" released in 1956, by Swedish-American folk singer William Clauson, credited Baxter, Holt, Cheeks and James as co-writers. Another gospel group, the Swan Silvertones, released their version of the song in 1957 on the Vee-Jay label, and folk singer Guy Carawan issued a version in 1958. Carawan wrote that he had learned the song in 1956 from Bob Gibson. Most modern recorded versions derive from the 1956 recording by Les Baxter. Further changes and additions were codified in 1959 by the folk music group the Weavers. The Weavers' performance of the song appears on their compilation albums Gospel and Reunion at Carnegie Hall Part 2. Nina Simone recording \\"Sinnerman\\" (spelled as one word) is one of Nina Simone's most famous songs and she recorded her definitive 10-minute-plus version on her 1965 album Pastel Blues. Simone learned the lyrics of this English song in her childhood when it was used at revival meetings by her mother, a Methodist minister, to help people confess their sins. In the early days of her career during the early sixties, when she was heavily involved in the Greenwich Village scene, Simone often used the long piece to end her live performances. An earlier version of the song exists, recorded live at The Village Gate, but was not used on the 1962 Colpix album Nina at the Village Gate. It was added as a bonus track to the 2005 CD release. Simone's version of Sinnerman has been sampled by Kanye West for the Talib Kweli song \\"Get By\\", by Timbaland for the song \\"Oh Timbaland\\", and by Felix da Housecat for Verve Record's \\"Verve Remixed\\" series. It has also been covered by 16 Horsepower on their album Folklore, and by Zegota on their self-titled single. French rapper Abd al- Malik sampled Simone's version for the title track of his 2006 album \\"Gibraltar\\". He also sampled Simone's version of \\"See Line Woman\\" for the track \\"Le grand fr√®re\\" from the same album. This version of the song is referenced on the 2018 Hozier track and EP Nina Cried Power. Simone's \\"Sinnerman\\" has also been featured in various films and commercials, including the 1999 remake of The Thomas Crown Affair. Peter Tosh and the Wailers versions \\"Sinner Man\\" has also been recorded as ska and reggae versions several times by the Wailers. It was first recorded by the group at Studio One in Kingston, Jamaica in early 1966; Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer shared lead vocals. A different version entitled \\"Downpressor\\" was recorded by Peter Tosh & The Wailers in 1970 (\\"downpressor\\" meaning \\"oppressor\\" in Rastafarian vocabulary). The song featured Tosh on lead vocals and Bunny Wailer on background. An instrumental version was also released. Songwriting credit for this version is sometimes given to Peter Tosh. Another version was recorded in 1971 as \\"Oppressor Man\\". This version was billed as a Peter Tosh solo single, and the B Side of the single featured an instrumental version. It was one of the rarer songs from the period before being included, along with its version, on JAD's Black Dignity compilation in 2004. Tosh recorded the song again as \\"Downpresser Man\\" for his 1977 solo album Equal Rights and released a live recording of the song in a medley with \\"Equal Rights\\" on his 1983 album Captured Live. Other versions The song was covered by Irish singer Sin√©ad O'Connor on her 2005 album Throw Down Your Arms, and by the ska-punk band Goldfinger. A cover of the song was the title track of the 1996 debut album, Sinnerman, by Atlantic Records recording artists Extra Fancy, led by openly gay singer Brian Grillo. The homoerotic music video made for the track featured Alexis Arquette as a closeted street preacher. In 2020, Vika and Linda covered the song for their album, Sunday (The Gospel According to Iso). In the Netflix show, Lucifer, Season 1 Episode 6: At his nightclub, Lux, Lucifer (played by Tom Ellis) plays the piano and sings Sinnerman for the crowd. In the 2020 HBO show, Lovecraft Country, the song is played over the closing credits for each episode. The cover is by Alice Smith.

The lazy Susan was initially uncommon enough in the United States for the utopianist Oneida Community to be credited with its invention.

More formally, n is a perfect power if there exist natural numbers m > 1, and k > 1 such that mk = n. In this case, n may be called a perfect kth power. If k = 2 or k = 3, then n is called a perfect square or perfect cube, respectively. Sometimes 0 and 1 are also considered perfect powers (0k = 0 for any k > 0, 1k = 1 for any k).  Examples and sums  A sequence of perfect powers can be generated by iterating through the possible values for m and k. The first few ascending perfect powers in numerical order (showing duplicate powers) are : : 2^2 = 4,\\\\ 2^3 = 8,\\\\ 3^2 = 9,\\\\ 2^4 = 16,\\\\ 4^2 = 16,\\\\ 5^2 = 25,\\\\ 3^3 = 27, 2^5 = 32,\\\\ 6^2 = 36,\\\\ 7^2 = 49,\\\\ 2^6 = 64,\\\\ 4^3 = 64,\\\\ 8^2 = 64, \\\\dots The sum of the reciprocals of the perfect powers (including duplicates such as 34 and 92, both of which equal 81) is 1: :\\\\sum_{m=2}^{\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=2}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{m^k}=1. which can be proved as follows: :\\\\sum_{m=2}^{\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=2}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{m^k} =\\\\sum_{m=2}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac {1}{m^2} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{m^k} =\\\\sum_{m=2}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac {1}{m^2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{m}{m-1} \\\\right) =\\\\sum_{m=2}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac {1}{m(m-1)} =\\\\sum_{m=2}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left( \\\\frac {1}{m-1} - \\\\frac {1}{m} \\\\right) = 1 \\\\, . The first perfect powers without duplicates are: :(sometimes 0 and 1), 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 125, 128, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 256, 289, 324, 343, 361, 400, 441, 484, 512, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1000, 1024, ... The sum of the reciprocals of the perfect powers p without duplicates is: :\\\\sum_{p}\\\\frac{1}{p}=\\\\sum_{k=2}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mu(k)(1-\\\\zeta(k)) \\\\approx 0.874464368 \\\\dots where Œº(k) is the M√∂bius function and Œ∂(k) is the Riemann zeta function. According to Euler, Goldbach showed (in a now-lost letter) that the sum of over the set of perfect powers p, excluding 1 and excluding duplicates, is 1: :\\\\sum_{p}\\\\frac{1}{p-1}= {\\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{7} + \\\\frac{1}{8}+ \\\\frac{1}{15} + \\\\frac{1}{24} + \\\\frac{1}{26}+ \\\\frac{1}{31}}+ \\\\cdots = 1. This is sometimes known as the Goldbach‚ÄìEuler theorem. Detecting perfect powers Detecting whether or not a given natural number n is a perfect power may be accomplished in many different ways, with varying levels of complexity. One of the simplest such methods is to consider all possible values for k across each of the divisors of n, up to k \\\\leq \\\\log_2 n. So if the divisors of n are n_1, n_2, \\\\dots, n_j then one of the values n_1^2, n_2^2, \\\\dots, n_j^2, n_1^3, n_2^3, \\\\dots must be equal to n if n is indeed a perfect power. This method can immediately be simplified by instead considering only prime values of k. This is because if n = m^k for a composite k = ap where p is prime, then this can simply be rewritten as n = m^k = m^{ap} = (m^a)^p. Because of this result, the minimal value of k must necessarily be prime. If the full factorization of n is known, say n = p_1^{\\\\alpha_1}p_2^{\\\\alpha_2} \\\\cdots p_r^{\\\\alpha_r} where the p_i are distinct primes, then n is a perfect power if and only if \\\\gcd(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_r) > 1 where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor. As an example, consider n = 296¬∑360¬∑724. Since gcd(96, 60, 24) = 12, n is a perfect 12th power (and a perfect 6th power, 4th power, cube and square, since 6, 4, 3 and 2 divide 12). Gaps between perfect powers In 2002 Romanian mathematician Preda MihƒÉilescu proved that the only pair of consecutive perfect powers is 23 = 8 and 32 = 9, thus proving Catalan's conjecture. Pillai's conjecture states that for any given positive integer k there are only a finite number of pairs of perfect powers whose difference is k. This is an unsolved problem.

(1920.) Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence, 7 ed., Taylor & Francis. (1873 edition) History Song Ci (1186‚Äì1249) was probably the first forensic scientist. He recorded all the known forensic techniques at the time in his book known as the Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified. Paul Zacchias was also one of the earliest figures of medical jurisprudence, with association with the Papal States and Catholic church. Zacchias was the personal physician to Pope Innocentius X and Pope Alexander VII, as well as legal adviser to the Rota Romana. His most well known book, Quaestiones medico-legales (1621-1651) established legal medicine as a topic of study. Zacchias work contains superstitious views on magic, witches, and demons which were widely held at the time. Medical jurisprudence had a chair founded at the University of Edinburgh in 1807, first occupied by Andrew Duncan, the younger. It was imposed on the university by the administration of Charles James Fox, and in particular Henry Erskine working with Andrew Duncan, the elder. Scope Medical jurisprudence is concerned with a broad range of medical, legal, and ethical issues, as well as human rights and rights of individuals. Physicians have a duty to act in their patients best interest and can be charged in a court of law if they fail to do so. On the other hand, a physician may be required to act in the interest of third parties if his patient is a danger to others. Failure to do so may lead to legal action against the physician. Medical jurisprudence includes: *questions of the legal and ethical duties of physicians; *questions affecting the civil Under the second heading, there are many aspects, including: *questions of competence or sanity in civil or criminal proceedings; *questions of competence of minors in matters affecting their own health; and, *questions of lawful fitness or safety to drive a motor vehicle, pilot an aeroplane, use scuba gear, play certain sports, or to join certain occupations. Under the third heading, there are also many aspects, including: *assessment of illness or injuries that may be work-related (see workers' compensation or occupational safety and health) or otherwise compensable; *assessment of injuries of minors that may relate to neglect or abuse; and, *certification of death or else the assessment of possible causes of death.

Pettit detailed his relationship with Zapatero in his A Political Philosophy in Public Life: Civic Republicanism in Zapatero's Spain, co-authored with Jos√© Luis Mart√≠. Pettit holds that the lessons learned when thinking about problems in one area of philosophy often constitute ready-made solutions to problems faced in completely different areas. Views he defends in philosophy of mind give rise to the solutions he offers to problems in metaphysics about the nature of free will, and to problems in the philosophy of the social sciences, and these in turn give rise to the solutions he provides to problems in moral philosophy and political philosophy.

Background  Born in Rotorua, New Zealand, she was the eldest of six children and grew up on the Bombay Hills,. In the early 1980s, she led a peripatetic life, traveling to Australia and around New Zealand. She moved to Christchurch in the late 1980s and, without any significant formal training, \\"devoted herself to her art practice\\". She held her first exhibition of photographs and drawings in Wellington in 1981, and her first painting exhibition at the Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery in 1989. In 1993, along with others such as the musician Peter Stapleton, she relocated to Dunedin where she participated in the city‚Äôs \\"‚Äòfree noise‚Äô scene\\", and was instrumental in establishing the Metonymic record label (1996) and the experimental film and music festival Lines of Flight (2000). She took up residence in her current studio near the Dunedin waterfront in 2007, which initiated \\"an especially concentrated period of painting\\".  Work  Involved in a number of different media, and a long-standing fixture on the experimental music scene, she, nonetheless, describes painting as her \\"ultimate life choice\\". The origins of this choice date back to when, as a child of ten, she was encouraged by her aunt to make images as an afternoon project. Pieters recalls this moment as a \\"numinous\\" experience. \\"Making a picture\\" creates a state of mind, in her words, in which \\"everything falls away.\\" She explains that \\"[p]ainting is where my attention is completely absorbed....I am happiest when I am painting.\\" She elaborates: \\"When I paint I am looking to hold the unsayable....For me, abstraction is intimately tied to ideas of experience and language. The most curious, the most wonderful thing ‚Äì but perhaps also the most terrifying ‚Äì is that which we can‚Äôt name. This is where everything begins for me.\\"  Critical reception  Pieters won the Waikato Museum‚Äôs National Contemporary Art Award in 2017 for her painting \\"The Meaning of Ethics\\" (2017, mixed media on board). Elizabeth Caldwell, director of the City Gallery in Wellington and judge for the award commented: \\"The work draws on a tradition of stylistic abstract painting. As a judge, one of the things I look for is originality and a signature style. Kim Pieters is an artist who uses her own vocabulary of gestures in her art-making. She has got complete mastery of her craft.\\" Pieters' work has been widely exhibited in New Zealand in galleries such as: Artspace NZ (2012), the Adam Art Gallery (2014), Inge Doesburg Gallery (2016), the Dunedin Public Art Gallery (2018), Bowerbank Ninow (2016, 2018) and RDS Gallery (2019).

The final result of the process can be either /b/ ‚Üí [v] or /v/ ‚Üí [b]. Betacism is a fairly common phenomenon; it has taken place in Greek, Hebrew and several Romance languages. Greek In Classical Greek, the letter beta ‚ü®Œ≤‚ü© denoted . As a result of betacism, it has come to denote in Modern Greek, a process which probably began during the Koine Greek period, approximately in the 1st century CE, along with the spirantization of the other . Modern (and earlier Medieval) Greek uses the digraph ‚ü®ŒºœÄ‚ü© to represent . Indeed, this is the origin of the word betacism.  Romance languages  Perhaps the best known example of betacism is in the Romance languages. The first traces of betacism in Latin can be found in the third century CE. The results of the shift are most widespread in the Western Romance languages, especially in Spanish, where the letters ‚ü®b‚ü© and ‚ü®v‚ü© are now both pronounced (the voiced bilabial fricative) except phrase-initially and after when they are pronounced ; the two sounds ( and ) are now allophones. Betacism is one of the main features in which Galician and northern Portuguese diverge from southern Portuguese; in Catalan betacism features in many dialects, though not in central and southern Valencian or in the Balearic dialect. Other Iberian languages with betacism are Astur-Leonese and Aragonese (in fact, for the latter there is a pronunciation-based orthography changing all v's into b's). Another example of betacism is in Neapolitan, or in Maceratese (dialect of Macerata, Italy) which uses ‚ü®v‚ü© to denote betacism-produced , such that Latin bucca corresponds to Neapolitan vocca and to Maceratese \\"vocca\\", Latin arborem to arvero or arvulo, and barba to Neapolitan varva and Maceratese \\"varba\\". = Betacism in Latin = A famous medieval Latin saying states: The saying is a pun referring to the fact that the Iberians would generally pronounce the letter v the same as b (which uses the sound [b] or [Œ≤]) instead of [w] or [v]. In Latin, the words vivere (\\"to live\\") and bibere (\\"to drink\\") are distinguished only by the use of the letters v and b, thus creating a point of confusion in the Iberian pronunciation.  Hebrew  Betacism occurred in Ancient Hebrew; the sound (denoted ‚ü®◊ë‚ü©) changed to and eventually to except when geminated or when following a consonant or pause. As a result, the two sounds became allophones; but, due to later sound changes, including the loss of gemination, the distinction became phonemic again in Modern Hebrew.

Indentation is perhaps the most commonly applied means of testing the mechanical properties of materials. The nanoindentation technique was developed in the mid-1970s to measure the hardness of small volumes of material. Background In a traditional indentation test (macro or micro indentation), a hard tip whose mechanical properties are known (frequently made of a very hard material like diamond) is pressed into a sample whose properties are unknown. The load placed on the indenter tip is increased as the tip penetrates further into the specimen and soon reaches a user-defined value. At this point, the load may be held constant for a period or removed. The area of the residual indentation in the sample is measured and the hardness, H, is defined as the maximum load, P_{max}, divided by the residual indentation area, A_r: :H=\\\\frac{P_\\\\text{max}} {A_\\\\text{r}}. For most techniques, the projected area may be measured directly using light microscopy. As can be seen from this equation, a given load will make a smaller indent in a \\"hard\\" material than a \\"soft\\" one. This technique is limited due to large and varied tip shapes, with indenter rigs which do not have very good spatial resolution (the location of the area to be indented is very hard to specify accurately). Comparison across experiments, typically done in different laboratories, is difficult and often meaningless. Nanoindentation improves on these macro- and micro-indentation tests by indenting on the nanoscale with a very precise tip shape, high spatial resolutions to place the indents, and by providing real-time load-displacement (into the surface) data while the indentation is in progress. Figure 1. Schematic of load-displacement curve for an instrumented nanoindentation test In nanoindentation small loads and tip sizes are used, so the indentation area may only be a few square micrometres or even nanometres. This presents problems in determining the hardness, as the contact area is not easily found. Atomic force microscopy or scanning electron microscopy techniques may be utilized to image the indentation, but can be quite cumbersome. Instead, an indenter with a geometry known to high precision (usually a Berkovich tip, which has a three-sided pyramid geometry) is employed. During the course of the instrumented indentation process, a record of the depth of penetration is made, and then the area of the indent is determined using the known geometry of the indentation tip. While indenting, various parameters such as load and depth of penetration can be measured. A record of these values can be plotted on a graph to create a load-displacement curve (such as the one shown in Figure 1). These curves can be used to extract mechanical properties of the material. =Young's modulus= The slope of the curve, dP/dh, upon unloading is indicative of the stiffness S of the contact. This value generally includes a contribution from both the material being tested and the response of the test device itself. The stiffness of the contact can be used to calculate the reduced Young's modulus E_r: :E_r=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta}\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}{2}\\\\frac{S}{\\\\sqrt{A_p(h_c)}}, Where A_p(h_c) is the projected area of the indentation at the contact depth h_c, and \\\\beta is a geometrical constant on the order of unity. A_p(h_c) is often approximated by a fitting polynomial as shown below for a Berkovich tip: A_p(h_c)=C_0h_c^2+C_1h_c^1+C_2h_c^{1/2}+C_3h_c^{1/4}+\\\\ldots+C_8h_c^{1/128} Where C_0 for a Berkovich tip is 24.5 while for a cube corner (90¬∞) tip is 2.598. The reduced modulus E_r is related to Young's modulus E_s of the test specimen through the following relationship from contact mechanics: :1/E_r=(1- u_i^2)/E_i+(1- u_s^2)/E_s. Here, the subscript i indicates a property of the indenter material and u is Poisson's ratio. For a diamond indenter tip, E_i is 1140 GPa and u_i is 0.07. Poisson‚Äôs ratio of the specimen, u_s, generally varies between 0 and 0.5 for most materials (though it can be negative) and is typically around 0.3. An atomic force microscope image of an indent left by a Berkovich tip in a Zr-Cu-Al metallic glass; the plastic flow of the material around the indenter is apparent. There are two different types of hardness that can be obtained from a nano indenter: one is as in traditional macroindentation tests where one attains a single hardness value per experiment; the other is based on the hardness as the material is being indented resulting in hardness as a function of depth. :H=\\\\frac{P_{max}} {A_{r}}. =Hardness= The hardness is given by the equation above, relating the maximum load to the indentation area. The area can be measured after the indentation by in-situ atomic force microscopy, or by 'after-the event' optical (or electron) microscopy. An example indentation image, from which the area may be determined, is shown at right. Some nanoindenters use an area function based on the geometry of the tip, compensating for elastic load during the test. Use of this area function provides a method of gaining real- time nanohardness values from a load-displacement graph. However, there is some controversy over the use of area functions to estimate the residual areas versus direct measurement. An area function A_p(h_c) typically describes the projected area of an indent as a 2nd-order polynomial function of the indenter depth h. When too many coefficients are used, the function will begin to fit to the noise in the data, and inflection points will develop. If the curve can fit well with only two coefficients, this is the best. However, if many data points are used, sometimes all 6 coefficients will need to be used to get a good area function. Typically, 3 or 4 coefficients works well. Service Document Probe Calibration; CSV-T-003 v3.0; Exclusive application of an area function in the absence of adequate knowledge of material response can lead to misinterpretation of resulting data. Cross-checking of areas microscopically is to be encouraged. =Strain-rate sensitivity= The strain-rate sensitivity of the flow stress m is defined as :m=\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ln{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\partial\\\\ln{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}}}, where \\\\sigma=\\\\sigma(\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}) is the flow stress and \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon} is the strain rate produced under the indenter. For nanoindentation experiments which include a holding period at constant load (i.e. the flat, top area of the load-displacement curve), m can be determined from :d\\\\ln{H}=m d\\\\ln{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_p}}+n d\\\\ln{h_p}. The subscripts p indicate these values are to be determined from the plastic components only. =Activation volume= Interpreted loosely as the volume swept out by dislocations during thermal activation, the activation volume V^* is :V^*=9 k_B T \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ln{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}}}{\\\\partial H}, where T is the temperature and kB is Boltzmann's constant. From the definition of m, it is easy to see that V^*\\\\propto (H m)^{-1}. Hardware =Sensors= The construction of a depth-sensing indentation system is made possible by the inclusion of very sensitive displacement and load sensing systems. Load transducers must be capable of measuring forces in the micronewton range and displacement sensors are very frequently capable of sub-nanometer resolution. Environmental isolation is crucial to the operation of the instrument. Vibrations transmitted to the device, fluctuations in atmospheric temperature and pressure, and thermal fluctuations of the components during the course of an experiment can cause significant errors. =Continuous stiffness measurement (CSM)= Dynamic nanoindentation with continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) Dynamic nanoindentation or continuous stiffness measurement (CSM, also offered commercially as CMX, dynamics...), introduced in 1989, is a significant improvement over the quasi-static mode described above. It consists into overlapping a very small, fast (> 40 Hz) oscillation onto the main loading signal and evaluate the magnitude of the resulting partial unloadings by a lock-in amplifier, so as to quasi-continuously determine the contact stiffness. This allows for the continuous evaluation of the hardness and Young's modulus of the material over the depth of the indentation, which is of great advantage with coatings and graded materials. The CSM method is also pivotal for the experimental determination of the local creep and strain-rate dependent mechanical properties of materials, as well as the local damping of visco-elastic materials. The harmonic amplitude of the oscillations is usually chosen around 2 nm (RMS), which is a trade-off value avoiding an underestimation of the stiffness due to the \\"dynamic unloading error\\" or the \\"plasticity error\\" during measurements on materials with unusually high elastic-to-plastic ratio (E/H > 150), such as soft metals. =Atomic Force Microscopy= The ability to conduct nanoindentation studies with nanometer depth, and sub-nanonewton force resolution is also possible using a standard AFM setup. The AFM allows for nanomechanical studies to be conducted alongside topographic analyses, without the use of dedicated instruments. Load- displacement curves can be collected similarly for a variety of materials - provided that they are softer than the AFM tip - and mechanical properties can be directly calculated from these curves. Conversely, some commercial nanoindentation systems offer the possibility to use a piezo-driven stage to image the topography of residual indents with the nanoindenter tip. Software =Experimental software= The indentation curves have often at least thousands of data points. The hardness and elastic modulus can quickly be calculated by using a programming language or a spreadsheet. Instrumented indentation testing machines come with the software specifically designed to analyze the indentation data from their own machine. The Indentation Grapher (Dureza) software is able to import text data from several commercial machines or custom made equipment.David Shuman; Indent Grapher (Dureza) Software Spreadsheet programs such as MS-Excel or OpenOffice Calculate do not have the ability to fit to the non-linear power law equation from indentation data. A linear fit can be done by offset (-h(P_0)) displacement so that the data passes through the origin. Then select the power law equation from the graphing XY options. The Martens hardness, HM, is a simple software for any programmer having minimal background to develop. The software starts by searching for the maximum displacement, h_{max}, point and maximum load, P_{max}. :HM=\\\\frac{P_{max}} {A_{s}}. The displacement is used to calculate the contact surface area, A_s, based on the indenter geometry. For a perfect Berkovich indenter the relationship is A_s = 24.5 h_{max}^2. The indentation hardness, H_{IT} is defined slightly different. :H_{IT}=\\\\frac{P_{max}} {A_{p}}. Here, the hardness is related to the projected contact area A_p. As the indent size decreases the error caused by tip rounding increases. The tip wear can be accounted for within the software by using a simple polynomial function. As the indenter tip wears the C_1 value will increase. The user enters the values for C_0 and C_1 based on direct measurements such as SEM or AFM images of the indenter tip or indirectly by using a material of known elastic modulus or an atomic force microscope (AFM) image of an indentation. :A_p = C_0 h_{max}^2 + C_1 h_{max}. Calculating the elastic modulus with software involves using software filtering techniques to separate the critical unloading data from the rest of the load-displacement data. The start and end points are usually found by using user defined percentages. This user input increases the variability because of possible human error. It would be best if the entire calculation process was automatically done for more consistent results. A good nanoindentation machine prints out the load unload curve data with labels to each of the segments such as loading, top hold, unload, bottom hold, and reloading. If multiple cycles are used then each one should be labeled. However mores nanoindenters only give the raw data for the load- unload curves. An automatic software technique finds the sharp change from the top hold time to the beginning of the unloading. This can be found by doing a linear fit to the top hold time data. The unload data starts when the load is 1.5 times standard deviation less than the hold time load. The minimum data point is the end of the unloading data. The computer calculates the elastic modulus with this data according to the Oliver‚ÄîPharr (nonlinear). The Doerner- Nix method is less complicated to program because it is a linear curve fit of the selected minimum to maximum data. However, it is limited because the calculated elastic modulus will decrease as more data points are used along the unloading curve. The Oliver-Pharr nonlinear curve fit method to the unloading curve data where h is the depth variable, h_f is the final depth and k and m are constants and coefficients. The software must use a nonlinear convergence method to solve for k, h_f and m that best fits the unloading data. The slope is calculated by differentiating dP/dh at the maximum displacement. :P = k \\\\left(h-h_{f}\\\\right)^m. An image of the indent can also be measured using software. The atomic force microscope (AFM) scans the indent. First the lowest point of the indentation is found. Make an array of lines around the using linear lines from indent center along the indent surface. Where the section line is more than several standard deviations (>3 \\\\sigma) from the surface noise the outline point is created. Then connect all of the outline points to build the entire indent outline. This outline will automatically include the pile-up contact area. For nanoindentation experiments performed with a conical indenter on a thin film deposited on a substrate or on a multilayer sample, the NIMS Matlab toolbox is useful for load-displacement curves analysis and calculations of Young's modulus and hardness of the coating. In the case of pop-in, the PopIn Matlab toolbox is a solution to analyze statistically pop-in distribution and to extract critical load or critical indentation depth, just before pop-in. Finally, for indentation maps obtained following the grid indentation technique, the TriDiMap Matlab toolbox offers the possibility to plot 2D or 3D maps and to analyze statistically mechanical properties distribution of each constituent, in case of a heterogeneous material by doing deconvolution of probability density function. =Computational software= Molecular dynamics (MD) has been a very powerful technique to investigate the nanoindentation at atomic scale. For instance, Alexey et al employed MD to simulate the nanoindentation process of a titanium crystal, dependence of deformation of the crystalline structure on the type of the indenter is observed, which is very hard to harvest in experiment. Tao et al performed MD simulations of nanoindentation on Cu/Ni nanotwinned multilayers films using a spherical indenter and investigated the effects of hetero-twin interface and twin thickness on hardness. Recently, a review paper by Carlos et al is published upon the atomistic studies of nanoindentation. This review covers different nanoindentation mechanisms and effects of surface orientation, crystallography (fcc, bcc, hcp, etc), surface and bulk damage on plasticity. All of the MD- obtained results are very difficult to be achieved in experiment due to the resolution limitation of structural characterization techniques. Among various MD simulation software, such as GROMACS, Xenoview, Amber, etc., LAMMPS (Large- scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), which is developed by Sandia National Laboratories, is the most widely used for simulation. An interaction potential and an input file including information of atom ID, coordinates, charges, ensemble, time step, etc are fed to the simulator, and then running could be executed. After specified running timesteps, information such as energy, atomic trajectories, and structural information (such as coordination number) could be output for further analysis, which makes it possible to investigate the nanoindentation mechanism at atomic-scale. Another interesting Matlab toolbox called STABiX has been developed to quantify slip transmission at grain boundaries by analyzing indentation experiments in bicrystal. Applications Nanoindentation is a robust technique for determination of mechanical properties. By combining the application of low loads, measuring the resulting displacement, and determining the contact area between the tip of the indenter and the sample a wide range of mechanical properties are able to be measured. The application that drove the innovation of the technique is testing thin film properties for which conventional testing are not feasible. Conventional mechanical testing such as tensile testing or dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) can only return the average property without any indication of variability across the sample. However, nanoindentation can be used for determination of local properties of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials. The reduction in sample size requirements has allowed the technique to become broadly applied to products where the manufactured state does not present enough material for microhardness testing. Applications in this area include medical implants, consumer goods, and packaging. Alternative uses of the technique are used to test MEMs devices by utilizing the low-loads and small scale displacements the nanoindenter is capable of. Limitations Conventional nanoindentation methods for calculation of Modulus of elasticity (based on the unloading curve) are limited to linear, isotropic materials. =Pile up and sink in= Problems associated with the \\"pile-up\\" or \\"sink-in\\" of the material on the edges of the indent during the indentation process remain a problem that is still under investigation. It is possible to measure the pile-up contact area using computerized image analysis of atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the indentations. This process also depends on the linear isotropic elastic recovery for the indent reconstruction. =Nanoindentation on soft materials= Nanoindentation of soft material has intrinsic challenges due to adhesion, surface detection and tip dependency of results. There is an ongoing research to overcome such problems. Two critical issues need to be considered when attempting nanoindentation measurements on soft materials: stiffness and viscoelasticity. The first is the requirement that in any force-displacement measurement platform the stiffness of the machine (k_{machine}) must approximately match the stiffness of the sample (k_{sample}), at least in order of magnitude. If k_{machine} is too high, then the indenter probe will simply run through the sample without being able to measure the force. On the other hand, if k_{machine} is too low, then the probe simply will not indent into the sample, and no reading of the probe displacement can be made. For samples that are very soft, the first of these two possibilities is likely. The stiffness of a sample is given by :k_{sample}‚âàa√óE_{sample} where a is the size of the contact region between the indenter and the sample, and E is the sample‚Äôs elastic modulus. Typical atomic-force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers have k_{machine} in the range 0.05 to 50 N/m, and probe size in the range ~10 nm to 1 Œºm. Commercial nanoindenters are also similar. Therefore, if k_{machine}‚âàk_{sample}, then a typical AFM cantilever-tip or a commercial nanoindenter can only measure E_{sample} in the ~kPa to GPa range. This range is wide enough to cover most synthetic materials including polymers, metals and ceramics, as well as a large variety of biological materials including tissues and adherent cells. However, there may be softer materials with moduli in the Pa range, such as floating cells, and these cannot be measured by an AFM or a commercial nanoindenter. To measure E_{sample} in the Pa range, ‚Äúpico-indentation‚Äù using an optical tweezers system is suitable. Here, a laser beam is used to trap a translucent bead which is then brought into contact with the soft sample so as to indent it. The trap stiffness (k_{machine}) depends on the laser power and bead material, and a typical value is ~50 pN/Œºm. The probe size a can be a micron or so. Then the optical trap can measure E_{sample} (‚âàk_{machine}/a)in the Pa range. The second issue concerning soft samples is their viscoelasticity. Methods to handle viscoelasticity include the following. In the classical treatment of viscoelasticity, the load-displacement (P-h) response measured from the sample is fitted to predictions from an assumed constitutive model (e.g. the Maxwell model) of the material comprising spring and dashpot elements. Such an approach can be very time consuming, and cannot in general prove the assumed constitutive law in an unambiguous manner. Dynamic indentation with an oscillatory load can be performed, and the viscoelastic behavior of the sample is presented in terms of the resultant storage and loss moduli, often as variations over the load frequency. However, the storage and loss moduli obtained this way are not intrinsic material constants, but depend on the oscillation frequency and the indenter probe geometry. A rate-jump method can be used to return an intrinsic elastic modulus of the sample that is independent of the test conditions. In this method, a constitutive law comprising any network of (in general) non-linear dashpots and linear elastic springs is assumed to hold within a very short time window about the time instant tc at which a sudden step change in the loading rate is applied on the sample. Since the dashpots are described by relations of the form \\\\dot\\\\epsilonij=\\\\dot\\\\epsilonij(\\\\sigmakl) but stress \\\\sigmakl is continuous across the step change ‚àÜ\\\\dot\\\\sigmaij in the stress rate field \\\\dot\\\\sigmakl at tc, there will not be any corresponding change in the strain rate field \\\\dot\\\\epsilonij across the dashpots. However, because the linear elastic springs are described by relations of the form \\\\epsilonij=Sikjl\\\\sigmakl where Sikjl are elastic compliances, a step change ‚àÜ\\\\dot\\\\epsilonij across the springs will result according to :‚àÜ\\\\dot\\\\epsilonij=Sikjl‚àÜ\\\\dot\\\\sigmakl The last equation indicates that the fields ‚àÜ\\\\sigmakl and ‚àÜ\\\\dot\\\\epsilonij can be solved as a linear elastic problem with the elastic spring elements in the original viscoelastic network model while the dashpot elements are ignored. The solution for a given test geometry is a linear relation between the step changes in the load and displacement rates at tc, and the linking proportionality constant is a lumped value of the elastic constants in the original viscoelastic model. Fitting such a relation to experimental results allows this lumped value to be measured as an intrinsic elastic modulus of the material. The rate-jump method Specific equations from this rate-jump method have been developed for specific test platforms. For example, in depth-sensing nanoindentation, the elastic modulus and hardness are evaluated at the onset of an unloading stage following a load-hold stage. Such an onset point for unloading is a rate-jump point, and solving the equation \\\\epsilonij=Sikjl\\\\sigmakl across this leads to the Tang-Ngan method of viscoelastic correction :\\\\frac{1}{S_e}=\\\\frac{1}{2E_ra}=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\dot h}{\\\\Delta\\\\dot P}=\\\\frac{1}{S}-\\\\frac{\\\\dot h_h}{\\\\dot P_u} where S = dP/dh is the apparent tip-sample contact stiffness at the onset of unload, \\\\dot h_h is the displacement rate just before the unload, \\\\dot P_u is the unloading rate, and S_e is the true (i.e. viscosity-corrected) tip-sample contact stiffness which is related to the reduced modulus E_r and the tip-sample contact size a by the Sneddon relation . The contact size a can be estimated from a pre-calibrated shape function f(h_c)=\\\\pi a^2 of the tip, where the contact depth h_c is obtainable using the Oliver‚ÄîPharr relation with the apparent contact stiffness S replaced by the true stiffness S_e: :h_c=h_{max} \\\\- \\\\epsilon\\\\frac{P_{max}}{S_e}= h_{max} \\\\- \\\\epsilonP_{max}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{S}-\\\\frac{\\\\dot h_h}{\\\\dot P_u}\\\\right) where \\\\epsilon is a factor depending on the tip (say, 0.72 for Berkovich tip). =Tip dependence= While nanoindentation testing can be relatively simple, the interpretation of results is challenging. One of the main challenges is the use of proper tip depending on the application and proper interpretation of the results. For instance, it has been shown that the elastic modulus can be tip dependent.

The parish is located on the north of the Weald, to the east of Tonbridge. The southern part of the parish lies within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, whilst most of the land also falls within the Metropolitan Green Belt. As well as Capel itself, the parish includes the communities of Castle Hill, Colts Hill, Five Oak Green, Postern, Tudeley and Whetsted.  History  The name Capel may have derived from its church being a chapel of the nearby church at Tudeley. The parish Church of St Thomas √† Becket is now redundant, and in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Services are held there four times a year, and the church is open to visitors daily. It contains some lovely 12th century wall paintings depicting Cain and Abel, and Christ's entry to Jerusalem, originally there to help those who could not read learn the stories of the Bible. Outside is a yew tree under which Thomas Becket himself is supposed to have preached. The church tower was partly rebuilt following a fire in 1639. The ecclesiastical parish is now known as Tudeley-cum-Capel with Five Oak Green.  Government  Capel falls within the jurisdiction of Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. Capel ward is currently represented by a Conservative councillor, Carol Mackonochie.  Geography  Capel hamlet is west of the nearest town, Paddock Wood, where there is a railway station, and north-east of Tunbridge Wells. There are two main clusters of buildings, one around the church, Church Farm and Tanners Farm, at the junction of Alders Road and Church lane; and another around the Dovecot Inn, on Alders Road. Hasted described Capel in the late 18th-century as being in: It has changed little since.  Culture and Community  Capel also sports the Dovecote Inn, a fine traditional Kentish pub which received an award from CAMRA, The Campaign For Real Ale on 14 February 2009, marking the pub's inclusion in every edition of the Good Beer Guide for the previous 10 years.

The overland route afforded an alternative to the river route, which required a difficult trip upstream on the Mississippi. Fort Massac is on the Ohio River, about 20 miles (overland) southwest of Lusk's Ferry. This was a French fort that was abandoned and burned in 1763, at the end of the French and Indian War, when control of the Illinois Country passed to the British. It is likely that the Lusk's Ferry road started as a French road that connected Fort Massac with Fort Kaskaskia. After Lusk's Ferry came into use, a road was built from the Ferry to the Fort Massac Road. With the Fort abandoned, the southern stretch of the road fell into disuse, and the road became the Lusk's Ferry Road. In his conquest of Illinois in 1778 and 1789, George Rogers Clark, with the army of Virginia, crossed the Ohio River from Kentucky to Fort Massac. From there he headed north to the Lusk's Ferry Road, which he followed at least part of the way to Fort Kaskaskia, whose defenses were oriented toward repelling an assault coming up the Mississippi. Clark was able to take the Fort by surprise by approaching from the interior of Illinois. The northwestern and southeastern segments of the Lusk's Ferry Road, close to Kaskaskia and Lusk's Ferry, were accurately mapped in the early surveys of Illinois, which were conducted around 1800. This survey was oriented toward marking out \\"Townships\\" that were six miles (10 km) square, subdivided into \\"Sections\\" that were one mile (1.6 km) square, pursuant to the Land Ordinance of 1785. Although the surveyors were not charged with mapping the roads, many did so. The locations of the roads were probably exact where they met the Section lines, about once every mile, and approximated between these points. The actual maps were drawn in the 1830s, but were based on the surveyors' notes from around 1800. The Lusk Ferry Road was a very old road, at least by Illinois standards, being present before the original survey. It is, however, notable that, on its northwestern end, this was a carefully surveyed road. It ran east out of Kaskaskia mostly in segments that ran nearly due east, almost to modern DuQuoin, where it made a sharp turn to the southeast, running for miles on a very straight line directly toward Fort Massac and Lusk's Ferry. Although the road jogged to avoid obstacles, it did not follow the natural lay of the land like animal trails, Indian trails and most pioneer roads. This was an engineered road that was not equaled in Illinois until many decades after the original survey. This suggests that the road had its origin as a military road connecting Fort Kaskaskia with Fort Massac. The road may have been laid out by the French in the 1750s, or by the Americans after the reoccupation of Fort Massac in 1794. The direction of the road was controlled by several factors. Out of Kaskaskia, the road went north toward the headwaters of Marys River, avoiding a river crossing. The road then headed east to cross the Big Muddy River as far upstream as possible consistent with a direct route to the southeast. After crossing the Big Muddy, the road seems to aim straight for the most direct pass over the Shawnee Hills. The Big Muddy crossing was a major limitation on this road. Although bridges over the Big Muddy existed in the area in the early 19th century, there is no reference to a bridge on the Lusk's Ferry Road. Even if there was a bridge, the Big Muddy is notable for its broad, flat floodplain. A true all weather route would have required long causeways over the floodplain that would have been more than a mile long. In wet weather, there were two options. One would be to go down the Mississippi and up the Ohio by boat. The other would have been to follow the Fort Vincennes road northeast to the Goshen Road, and then southeast to Old Shawneetown, Illinois. Although this would have been at least eighty miles farther, there were no river crossings. Randolph County The original surveys of Illinois show several roads in Randolph County, consistent with its role as the original State Capital and economic center of the State. Towards the eastern edge of the County (Township 6 South, Range 5 West), one of these roads is clearly labeled as the Lusk's Ferry Road. This road crosses Mary's River, just to the north of modern County road 1400N. The road seems to join modern Illinois Route 150 through Steeleville. At the east edge of Steeleville, the old road veered south from Route 150, heading straight for modern Illinois Route 4 at the county line. *TopoQuest Steeleville Perry County The Lusk Ferry Road entered Perry County, in T6S, R4W, on modern Route 4. Rather than follow that road south, however, the old road headed almost due east across the Township to what was once the village of Denmark. There the road jogged a mile south, along the eastern boundary of T6S, R3W, and again headed due east, crossing Beaucoup Creek, just north of its fork with Gallum Creek. The road exited to T6S, R2W just north of the Pinckneyville/DuQuoin Airport. From there the road jogged back a mile north, and headed due east toward Duquoin. Although this township became a moonscape of strip mines, there is an east/west road through the spoil piles that seems to line up exactly with the old road. Just west of DuQuoin, the Lusk Ferry Road turned toward the southeast, near the point where it entered T6S, R1W, running about six miles (10 km) toward Jackson County and the Big Muddy River. Somewhere close to the Big Muddy, Chief DuQuoin met his defeat at the hands of the Shawnee. *Google Maps, Denmark *TopoQuest DuQuoin Jackson County The Lusk Ferry Road cut through the northeast corner of Jackson County in T7S, R1W. The road entered the County about west of the corner, heading southeast. It crossed the Little Muddy River, and exited the County about south of the northeast corner. *TopoQuest, NW Corner, Jackson County Franklin County The Lusk Ferry Road cut through the southwest corner of Franklin County, heading southeast. It entered the County about four miles (6 km) north of the corner, passing through Royalton, before exiting the county about four miles (6 km) east of the corner. Although it is not shown on the original survey maps, there must have been a road that crossed or branched off of the Lusk Ferry Road in Franklin County. In 1814, John James Audubon attempted to cross Illinois by horse, on his way to Henderson, Kentucky. Audubon lost his horse crossing the Big Muddy near modern Plumfield, and nearly lost his life soon thereafter. This suggests an east/west road roughly following modern Illinois Route 149. This road would have led to Frank's Fort and Jordan's Fort, which were built around 1811, in response to Tecumseh's War. *TopoQuest Little Muddy NW of Royalton *TopoQuest Royalton to Big Muddy to Herrin Williamson County The Lusk's Ferry Road entered Williamson County, in T8S, R1E, about four miles (6 km) east of the northwest corner of the County, heading southeast, straight toward modern Herrin. The road followed modern Illinois Route 148, but was about a mile south. This area was heavily strip mined, raising the possibility that Route 148 once followed the old road, but was moved a mile north to avoid the mines. The road turned south, running straight though modern downtown Herrin, T8S, R2E, along the route of modern Route 148. South of Herrin, the road entered T9S, R2E. The Lusk's Ferry Road is clearly marked as such where it entered this Township. The road then enters a maze of \\"Traces\\", none of which are clearly marked as the Lusk Ferry Road. About five miles (8 km) south of Herrin there was once a town called \\"Bainbridge\\". All that is now left is the Bainbridge cemetery, about five miles (8 km) southwest of Marion. This was located in what is now the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge. Some sources describe this as an important early cross roads in this area, near the base of the Shawnee Hills. Beyond Bainbridge, the Lusk's Ferry Road is not marked on the old maps through the rest of Williamson County. There were two routes over the hills to the south, neither of which is clearly marked on the original survey maps. The western route crossed the Shawnee Hills at \\"Buffalo Gap\\", near Goreville. The eastern crossed the Shawnee Hills at \\"Mocassin Gap\\". While the Buffalo Gap route had the lower summit, the Mocassin Gap was the more direct route. There is a line of disconnected diagonal road segments leading from Marion to Creal Springs, a small village in southeastern Williamson County. A modern road runs south out of Creal Springs toward Lake of Egypt. This is the most likely route for the Lusk's Ferry Road. *TopoQuest Herrin to Bainbridge *TopoQuest Creal Springs to Wagon Creek Mocassin Gap/Johnson County The road from Creal Springs enters Johnson County a little to the east of Lake of Egypt. There it turns southeast, running up the Shawnee Hills alongside Wagon Creek. On the original survey plats, a short segment of the Lusk's Ferry Road is labeled in Section 19, T11S, R4E. This segment lines up with the Wagon Creek Road, and is pointed toward modern Reynoldsburg, three miles (5 km) southeast, which some sources cite as having been on the road. (The road is not, however, shown on the map at the location of Reynoldsburg.) The Shawnee summit is between the mapped segment and Reynoldsburg, so this area was probably once called Mocassin Gap. Modern U.S. Route 45 crosses this area, but perpendicular to the apparent route of the old road. The short, mapped segment of the road between Wagon Creek and Reynoldsburg shows the road going down a steep grade to Sugar Creek. A high ridge lies between Sugar Creek and Reynoldsburg. From the top of the ridge, a modern road runs down to Mocassin Gap and Reynoldsburg. This is probably the route of the old road: except for the missing Sugar Creek crossing, there would be a modern road all the way from Creal Springs to Reynoldsburg. Crossing the Sugar Creek valley and the ensuing ridge was probably very difficult. Having reached the ridge overlooking Sugar Creek, it would have been far easier to go southwest toward Tunnel Hill, circling around the watershed back east toward Reynoldsburg. A line of modern roads follows this route. Alternatively, it would have been much simpler to have gone in a zig zag from Creal Springs to New Burnside, through the gap along modern U.S. Route 45, and then back east to Reynoldsburg. The original route may be hard to spot in this area because it was abandoned early on for the simpler routes followed by the modern roads. *TopoQuest, Sugar Creek Pope County The original survey shows the Lusk's Ferry Road entering Pope County near the modern village of Robbs. From there, the road followed the modern County/Forest Service road through Glendale and Rising Sun, down to Illinois Route 146. The road then followed Route 146 into Golconda and Lusk's Ferry. *TopoQuest Reynoldsburg to Robbs & Glendale, Illinois *TopoQuest Robbs & Glendale to Rising Sun, Illinois *TopoQuest Rising Sun to Golconda, Illinois Notes See also *Ford's Ferry Road References *History of Southern Illinois, G.W.

Biography Born in 1947 to Nicholas L. Bissell Sr. (1919-2002) and his wife, Louise, Nick Bissell grew up in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey and later moved to Somerville, New Jersey. He entered private practice, then worked as a part-time judge. He then became an assistant prosecutor in Somerset County, and was appointed county prosecutor in 1982 by Governor Tom Kean. He held that position for 13 years. His specialty was civil forfeiture. At one point, the value of the assets he seized were the highest in the state, even though Somerset County is the eighth-smallest county in New Jersey. One of his best-known cases that didn't involve a forfeiture was the prosecution of Matthew Heikkila, a 21-year-old from affluent Basking Ridge, who, on January 29, 1991, murdered his adoptive parents. Although Bissell pressed for the death penalty, the jury sentenced Heikkila to two consecutive life sentences., CrimeLibrary.com; accessed January 26, 2017. In 1990, a forfeiture case proved to be Bissell's downfall. On May 10, 1990, James Giuffre was arrested on charges of selling $700 worth of cocaine. Bissell said he would drop the charges if Giuffre forfeited two plots of land to the prosecutor's office, valued at $174,000. They were sold at auction below their appraised value to a friend of Bissell's chief of detectives. Giuffre filed a civil suit against Bissell (which the Somerset County Freeholders later settled for $435,000) and also then contacted the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI. Forensic accountants with the IRS discovered that Bissell skimmed cash from a gas station of which he was part owner. The FBI discovered that Bissell had destroyed a suspect's written request for a lawyer and threatened to frame his gasoline wholesaler for cocaine possession. In September 1995, Bissell was indicted on 30 federal charges of mail fraud, tax evasion and abuse of power, and was promptly fired by Governor and Somerset County resident Christine Todd Whitman. In May 1996, he was convicted on all charges and faced a minimum sentence of six to eight years in federal prison and a maximum of ten years. He was released under the condition that he wear an electronic bracelet until he was sentenced. He abruptly cut it off on November 18, 1996 and fled to Nevada, leaving a note in which he stated that he intended to commit suicide. He was tracked by his cell phone. He fatally shot himself after a 10-minute standoff in his hotel room, while members of the United States Marshals Service tried to lure him out of his room.

After a criminal trial, on 15 February 2006 Chen was sentenced to life imprisonment. His appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court to have the sentence reduced suffered a shock when the Supreme Court imposed the death penalty on 6 September 2006. A subsequent appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court, following a full confession by Chen to his role in the plan to import heroin from Bali to Australia, resulted in the original sentence of life imprisonment being reinstated. Alleged trafficking conspiracy It is unclear how Chen, aged 20 years, from Doonside in Sydney, was connected to the fellow members of the Bali Nine. According to media reports, acting on behalf of Myuran Sukumaran, on 5 April 2005 Chen handed Renae Lawrence A$500 at a Sydney hotel representing spending money for Lawrence's trip to Bali.

Sukumaran, who was also with them, with his bags, left them with the others as he decided to go to the Hard Rock Hotel complex. =Arrest in Indonesia= Approximately 20 minutes after checking in, Chen was arrested at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta on 17 April 2005 with Nguyen, Sukumaran and Norman. Indonesian police claim the group were in possession of of heroin and bundles of plastic wrapping, Elastoplast tape, and a set of scales, indicating involvement in a plan to transport drugs to Australia. Earlier that day at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Indonesian police also arrested the following drug mules after they were found carrying various amounts of heroin concealed on their bodies. Martin Stephens was found to be carrying ; Renae Lawrence was found to be carrying ; Michael Czugaj was found to be carrying and Scott Rush was found to be carrying of heroin. Alleged co- ringleader, Andrew Chan was also arrested the same day whilst seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time Chan was arrested, he was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession. Two weeks after leaving Australia, Chen's father reported him missing to Australian police and had no idea he was abroad; saying: :\\"I didn't see him for two weeks. I never knew he was overseas. I am very surprised to hear this news.\\" =Criticism of Australian Federal Police tipoff= Lee Rush, the father of Scott Rush, a fellow member of the Bali Nine, said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying: Rush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney- General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006. Criminal trial Criminal trials for the accused commenced in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Chen, Nguyen, and Norman, all arrested at the Melasti Hotel and earning the numeric epithet, The Melasti Three, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately. During the trial it was reported that Chen denied any involvement in the alleged drug trafficking operation. Chen was quiet throughout proceedings and at times could barely be heard by panel judges. In December 2005, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment;. Lawyers acting for Stephens, one of the Bali Nine, claimed that the fairness of his trial was in jeopardy following comments made in the media by Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda that Australians should be prepared for members of the Bali Nine to receive a death sentence, if found guilty. =Sentencing and appeal= In pre-sentence proceedings, Chen's father, Edward Chen, was reported as saying: During his final plea on 2 February 2006, Chen said: On 15 February 2006 Chen was sentenced to life imprisonment. Commenting on the sentences at the time, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Keelty stated: The Australian Prime Minister John Howard was reported as commenting: A subsequent appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court to have the sentence reduced suffered a shock on 6 September 2006 when the death penalty was imposed on Chen, Nguyen, and Norman. Following a full confession by Chen during a subsequent appeal for leniency, the original sentence of life imprisonment being reinstated with some media reports that the Melasti Three could be released before 2020, subject to good behaviour. Additional arrests In February 2006, as verdicts and sentences were handed down in the trial of the Bali Nine, additional arrests were made in Australia. Prison life Chen is serving his sentence in Kerobokan Prison where he is working in partnership with a local jewellery company Yin Jewellery to establish Mule Jewels, a rehabilitative silver making programme that offers inmates a trade skill that they are able to use upon release, and gives inmates some constructive and therapeutic work. Chen has stated online that he is sharing a cell with an Australian and a Japanese person. \\"It's comfortable enough for the three of us but it is dirty.\\" He has since become a Christian.

Nordhaus received the prize \\"for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis\\". Education and career Nordhaus was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the son of Virginia (Riggs) and Robert J. Nordhaus, who co-founded the Sandia Peak Tramway. Robert J. Nordhaus was from a German Jewish family ‚Äî his father Max Nordhaus (1865‚Äì1936) immigrated from Paderborn in 1883 and was a manager of The Charles Ilfeld Company branch in Albuquerque. Nordhaus graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover and subsequently received his BA and MA from Yale in 1963 and 1973, respectively, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He also holds a Certificate from the Institut d'Etudes Politiques (1962) and a PhD from MIT (1967). He was a Visiting Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1970-1971. He has been a member of the faculty at Yale since 1967, in both the Economics department and the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and has also served as its Provost from 1986‚Äì1988 and its Vice President for Finance and Administration from 1992‚Äì1993. His tenure as provost was among the shortest in the university's history. He has been on the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity since 1972. During the Carter administration, from 1977‚Äì1979, Nordhaus was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Nordhaus served as the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank between 2014 and 2015. Nordhaus lives in New Haven, Connecticut, with his wife, Barbara, a social worker in the Yale Child Study Center. Contributions to economics and the study of climate change Nordhaus is the author or editor of over 20 books. One of his early works, he partnered with Paul Samuelson as a co-author for an introductory textbook entitled Economics. Nordhaus worked alongside Samuelson from the 12th edition until the 19th, starting in 1985. It was first published in 1948 and has appeared in nineteen different editions and seventeen different languages. It was known as a best- selling economics textbook for decades and is still extremely popular today. Economics was called a ‚Äúcanonical textbook‚Äù, and the development of mainstream economic thought has been traced by comparing the fourteen editions under Samuelson‚Äôs editing. He has also written several books on global warming and climate change, one of his primary areas of research. Those books include Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change (1994), which won the 2006 Award for \\"Publication of Enduring Quality\\" from the Association of Environmental and Resource Economics. Another book, with Joseph Boyer, is Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming (2000). His most recent book is The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World. In 1972 Nordhaus, along with fellow Yale economics professor James Tobin, published Is Growth Obsolete?, an article that introduced the Measure of Economic Welfare (Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare) as the first model for economic sustainability assessment. Nordhaus is also known for his critique of current measures of national income. He wrote, \\"If we are to obtain accurate estimates of the growth of real incomes over the last century, we must somehow construct price indexes that account for the vast changes in the quality and range of goods and services that we consume, that somehow compare the services of horse with automobile, of Pony Express with facsimile machine, of carbon paper with photocopier, of dark and lonely nights with nights spent watching television, and of brain surgery with magnetic resonance imaging\\" (1997, 30).Nordhaus, William D. 1997. \\"Do Real Output and Real Wage Measures Capture Reality? The History of Light Suggests Not.\\" The Economics of New Goods. Edited by Robert J. Gordon and Timothy F. Bresnahan. University of Chicago Press for the National Bureau of Economic Research. 27-70. Palda summarizes the importance of Nordhaus's insight as follows: \\"The practical lesson to be drawn from this fascinating study of lighting is that the way we measure the consumer price index is severely flawed. Instead of putting goods and their prices directly into the index we should reduce all goods to their constituent characteristics. Then we should evaluate how these goods can best be combined to minimize the cost of consuming these characteristics. Such an approach would allow us to include new goods in the consumer price index without worrying about whether the index of today is comparable to that of ten years ago when the good did not exist. Such an approach would also allow governments to more precisely calculate the rate at which welfare and other forms of aid should be increased. At present, such calculations tend to overestimate the cost of living because they do not take into account the manner in which increases in quality reduce the monetary cost of maintaining a certain standard of living.\\"Palda, Filip (2013). The Apprentice Economist: Seven Steps to Mastery. Cooper-Wolfling Press. = Contributions on economics of climate change = Nordhaus has written on the economics of climate change. He is the developer of the DICE and RICE models, integrated assessment models of the interplay between economics, energy use, and climate change. A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies was published by Yale University Press on June 24, 2008. In Reflections on the Economics of Climate Change (1993), he states: \\"Mankind is playing dice with the natural environment through a multitude of interventions ‚Äì injecting into the atmosphere trace gases like the greenhouse gases or ozone-depleting chemicals, engineering massive land-use changes such as deforestation, depleting multitudes of species in their natural habitats even while creating transgenic ones in the laboratory, and accumulating sufficient nuclear weapons to destroy human civilizations.\\"Nordhaus, W. D. '\\"Reflections on the economics of climate change\\", Journal of Economic Perspectives (1993); 7(4) 11‚Äì25 at p. 11 Under the climate change models he has developed, in general those sectors of the economy that depend heavily on unmanaged ecosystems ‚Äì that is, are heavily dependent upon naturally occurring rainfall, runoff, or temperatures ‚Äì will be most sensitive to climate change. Agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation, and coastal activities fall in this category.\\"Nordhaus, W. D. '\\"Reflections on the economics of climate change\\", Journal of Economic Perspectives (1993); 7(4) 11‚Äì25 at p. 15 Nordhaus takes seriously the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. In 2007, Nordhaus, who has done several studies on the economics of global warming, criticized the Stern Review for its use of a low discount rate: In 2013, Nordhaus chaired a committee of the National Research Council that produced a report discounting the impact of fossil fuel subsidies on greenhouse gas emissions. However, in a December 2016 discussion paper for the Cowles Foundation, his research using the updated DICE model \\"...confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if there are not major climate-change policies. It suggests that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the 2¬∞C target of international agreements even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term. The required carbon price needed to achieve current targets has risen over time as policies have been delayed.\\" In a January 2020 interview with Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Nordhaus claimed that achieving the 2¬∞C goal of the Paris agreement was \\"impossible\\", stating that \\"even if we make the fastest possible turn towards zero emissions, CO2 will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere, because we cannot simply shut down our economy\\". He asserted that he was not alone in making this assessment, claiming that half of the simulation arrived at the same conclusion. He also remarked that the two-degree target was set without asking about the cost of meeting it.  Honors  = Scientific and engineering academies = Among many honors, he is a Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and an Elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has been a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences since 1999. = American Economic Association = In 2004, Nordhaus was designated a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association (AEA), along with George P. Shultz and William A. Brock.American Economic Association \\"Distinguished Fellows\\". The accompanying AEA statement referred to his \\"knack for asking large questions about the measurement of economic growth and well-being, and addressing them with simple but creative insights,\\" among them, his pioneering work on the political business cycle,‚Ä¢ William D.

Nordhaus, Distinguished Fellow\\". In 2013, Nordhaus became president-elect of the AEA, and served as the association's president between 2014 and 2015. = Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics = Nordhaus was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2018, which he shared with Paul Romer. In detailing its reasons for giving the prize to Nordhaus, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences specifically recognized his efforts to develop \\"an integrated assessment model, i.e. a quantitative model that describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate. His model integrates theories and empirical results from physics, chemistry and economics. Nordhaus' model is now widely spread and is used to simulate how the economy and the climate co-evolve.\\" Many of the news outlets that reported on Nordhaus's prize noted that he was in the advance wave of economists who embraced a carbon tax as a preferred method of carbon pricing. Some climate scientists and commentators were disappointed with the Nobel Prize going to Nordhaus due to his embrace of substantially lower carbon taxes per ton than most scientists, along with his past history of minimal carbon taxes.  Criticisms  Economist Steve Keen has severely criticized Nordhaus work and said that his claim that a 4¬∞C increase in global temperature over pre-industrial levels is only going to reduce GDP per capita by between 2% and 4% is nonsense. Keen disagrees that Nordhaus's \\"Damage Function\\" should be a quadratic equation. To demonstrate this he says that since his damage function is symmetrical \\"it predicts precisely the same level of damage to GDP from a fall of, for example, 4¬∞C in the global average temperature, as it does for a rise of 4¬∞C.\\" If we try to apply the function to a period we had 20,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, where countries like Canada, Ireland, Scotland, northern Germany, Poland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were under a kilometer or more of ice, the function would also estimate a reduction of GDP by 2% and 4%. Professor Steve Keen also gave a presentation \\"Flawed Approaches (and a New Approach) to Environmental Challenges\\" at the OECD Conference \\"Averting Systemic Collapse\\" in Paris on September 18th 2019 criticizing in detail why he believes Nordhaus's work is fatally flawed. In one of his slides, he shows that 4¬∞C of warming would mean that approximately 6.7 billion people die, which is incompatible with the idea that GDP would only be reduced by a few percent. Others have also pointed out that climate scientists and ecologists have a very negative opinion of Nordhaus. Dr. Jason Hickel, who researches ecological economics, writes that \\"Many believe that the failure of the world‚Äôs governments to pursue aggressive climate action over the past few decades is in large part due to arguments that Nordhaus has advanced.\\" One of his criticisms is that Nordhaus uses a very high discount rate which allows him to argue that we shouldn‚Äôt reduce emissions too quickly, because the economic cost to people today will be higher than the benefit of protecting people in the future. Most climate scientists assume non-linear impacts. This had not been properly accounted for by Nordhaus in the 1980s, when less was known about climate change: Publications * References  Further reading  * External links * William Nordhaus (Yale Home Page) * The Question of Global Warming Nordhaus exchange with Freeman Dyson and others from The New York Review of Books * Energy: Friend or Enemy?

He also acts, writes plays, and teaches.Orlando Sentinel Early life and education Horn was born in Orlando, Florida and grew up in Tarpon Springs, Florida, although he spent a good amount of his life in Orlando, Florida. He began piano lessons at the age of 7 thanks to his Grandmother's urging. While in middle school he joined the local theatre and performed in many plays. By this point he was a pretty accomplished pianist and turned his sight on combining his loves of theatre and music: directing musicals. By the time he graduated high school he had appeared in over 30 productions either as an actor, the musical director, or both. In his junior year he took a break to become a drum major. He continued to perform in many local events singing and playing piano throughout his teen years. Career =Natural= Many publicity stories and urban legends exist as to how Natural was started, but the most likely one is that in 1999, Marc Terenzi met a man named Patrick King at a party. The men hit it off and with their friends Michael Johnson and Ben Bledsoe they created a boy band which was the big thing of the time. After many line up changes Ben Bledsoe found Horn through his vocal teacher. He sang \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" for his audition and even had to do it over the phone for members who were not present at the time. After that, Horn joined Natural. The boys tried to get signed with many major labels but were turned down despite a huge local following in Orlando, FL. One day as they rehearsed at Transcontinental Studios, boyband king Lou Pearlman noticed them and liked their act. Soon after, they were signed with Transcontinental Records. Lou Pearlman had a new twist for his old boy band vision: not only would they dance, sing, and look cute, but they would also play instruments. Horn became the pianist and one of the lead vocalists. Pearlman spared no expense promoting the guys' first single with Claire's and a tour with The Monkees. However American fame was slow and the guys were soon sent to Germany to conquer little girl's hearts. They had much success with such hits as \\"Put Your Arms Around Me\\", \\"Will It Ever\\", and \\"Runaway\\". In the summer of 2001 Marc Terenzi met German pop star Sarah Connor at a music festival. The two soon hit it off and were dating despite Lou Pearlman's wishes. Lou Pearlman had strict rules for his boy bands: they could not have facial hair, they could not have many piercings or tattoos, and they definitely could not have girlfriends. However, the relationship continued on. Meanwhile, Horn seemed to have trouble adjusting to boy band life. He often refused to wear the silly and skimpy (the boys posed almost nude at least 3 times in the band's history) outfits looking the odd one out. He also did not seem to enjoy the poppy music; his true love was Jazz and Broadway styled tunes. In the summer of 2003 Sarah Connor became pregnant and the couple became engaged. Around this time Natural was coming back from a hiatus and releasing a single 'What if' from their 2nd album It's Only Natural. Lou Pearlman was not happy with the news and wanted Marc kicked out of Natural and replaced with someone new. The other members (except Patrick King) were not thrilled with this and decided to break Natural up. However, Horn appeared to have very little to do with the project by this point. While Lou was threatening the end of the band it appeared the tour would not happen and Horn made other commitments to star in a production of 'Merrily We roll along' back home. He also had a few other projects coming up with Rollins College which he had been attending. By the time it was announced the tour was gone Horn decided he had had enough and would not join the other guys. =Later work= Horn got started right away on his life after Natural. He as planned starred in Merrily We Roll Along where he met his to be wife Olivia right before Hurricane Jeanne. They soon got engaged and married in 2005. Horn spent much of 2004 and 2005 acting and musically directing in several Rollins College and other local productions of such plays as Annie Get Your Gun, Sweeney Todd, A Day in Hollywood / A Night in Ukraine. He also helped work on the Bach Festival in Winter Park, Florida in 2005. Horn is currently teaching music, and working on various productions in the Orlando area. He also has been rumored to be writing his own play.

Early life Ansbert was born at Chaussy-sur-Epte, a village in the Norman historical area known as the Vexin. He was born to a noble family, and was highly educated. He had a significant professional career, and is said to have served as a senior member of the court of the Merovingian king, Clotaire III. As such, he was both chancellor and referendary. Ansbert was engaged to be married to another future saint, Angadrisma. Her father, said to have been another of Clotaire's chancellors, arranged for her to wed his colleague, but Angadrisma ‚Äì later a patroness of nuns ‚Äì prayed for release from this obligation. Tradition states that dispensation was given to her after she was \\"struck down with leprosy\\", a disfiguring malady which only disappeared when she joined a convent. Some sources state that Ansbert later took a different bride. Religious vocation In 673, the same year Clotaire died, Ansbert renounced his secular pursuits and became a monk of the Benedictine order. Six years later, he was elevated to abbot of his monastery, the illustrious Fontenelle Abbey. He followed two other saints in that office: Wandrille, the abbey's founder and first abbot, and Lambert, the second abbot, who vacated the office when he was named bishop of Lyons. Under his leadership, Fontenelle prospered. His enterprises included a great expansion and refinement of the abbey's library, and the establishment of local hospitals for the poor. During his time as abbot, Ansbert served as the confessor to King Theodoric III. After several years, Ansbert was appointed archbishop of Rouen following the death of the previous officeholder, Saint Ouen, in 683 or 684. His former mentor Saint Lambert performed his consecration, and Ansbert was succeeded as abbot at Fontenelle by Hildebert (d. 701), who is also venerated as a saint. Despite his high office and eminent reputation, Ansbert was removed from the bishopric around the year 690. By \\"a false accusation\\", the powerful majordomo of the Frankish court, Pepin of Heristal, arranged his dismissal, either because of some kind of political opposition or because Ansbert's \\"zeal was not well-received\\" and \\"his austere life caused offence\\". He was sent into exile at the monastery of Hautmont where he stayed until his death, sometime between 692 and 695. At some time Pepin apparently reconsidered his actions and agreed to allow Ansbert to return, but either he changed his mind again or Ansbert died before making the trip. Legacy The 12th-century chronicler Ordericus Vitalis relays a tale in which it was said that Ansbert's remains were desecrated and dispersed by soldiers of Hugh the Great. He asserts that the bones in question belonged to a different Ansbert, and that those of the saint were, at the time of his writing, still preserved safely at Fontenelle Abbey. The 18th-century author Alban Butler, however, states that the remains were at some point transferred to St. Peter's Abbey in Ghent, where they were destroyed by Calvinists in 1578. A collective day of remembrance for all the many saints associated with Fontenelle Abbey is celebrated on 1 March. Saint Ansbert's own annual feast day is 9 February.

Right from the first issue on April 18, 2005, it attempted to bite into the market held for decades by Sportski ≈æurnal and Sport dailies. The paper went about their goal by offering bold, often bordering on sensationalist, coverage of day-to-day sporting events, as well as wider on-going trends in sport. The very first issue set the tone fittingly. It featured an in-your-face cover headline screaming \\"Shame\\", as teaser for an interview with Milorad Kosanoviƒá, former Serbia-Montenegro under-21 national team and Red Star Belgrade coach, in which he claimed the Serbia-Montenegro league is entirely rigged.

At 14, he began to play guitar and within a short time, was able to sit in with local bar bands. As he got older, he began composing his own songs. After he graduated from Oak Ridge High School in El Dorado Hills, he moved to Sacramento and got his start by playing at local establishments like Fox & Gooseand The Blue Lamp. He recorded in a makeshift garage studio, burning his own CDs and selling them everywhere he could. Using the money he saved, Greene was eventually able to record and release his first full-length album, Rusty Nails, on his own. Career In late 2002, Greene released his first album with DIG, Gone Wanderin', which won the California Music Award for the Best Blues/Roots Album in 2003 and remained on the national Americana charts for over a year. In 2004, Greene released his third album, Sweet Somewhere Bound, and began receiving radio play for singles like \\"Honey I Been Thinking About You\\". Greene has toured nationally with Gov't Mule, Los Lobos, Mark Knopfler, B.B. King, Phil Lesh, Ratdog, Huey Lewis, Susan Tedeschi, Taj Mahal, and Buddy Guy, and has played major U.S. festivals, including All Good, Gathering of the Vibes, Mountain Jam, Grateful Garcia Gathering, Newport Jazz, Newport Folk, South by Southwest, Wakarusa, Winnipeg Folk, Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, and Rothbury. He has performed with Levon Helm at several Midnight Rambles. In early 2005, he signed with Verve Forecast. Sweet Somewhere Bound was reissued that year, followed by a new release, American Myth, in March 2006. The following year, Greene joined Phil Lesh and Friends, the Grateful Dead bassist's ensemble dedicated to the interpretation of the Dead's extensive song book. Other members of the band at the time included John Molo, Larry Campbell and Steve Molitz. Also in 2005 his song \\"I Will Never Let You Go\\" was used in the score for the movie Brokeback Mountain, winning the Academy Award in 2005 for Best Original Score, and which was also released on the Verve label. In 2007, his cover of \\"Look Out Cleveland\\" was included on the tribute album Endless Highway: The Music of The Band. Meanwhile, Greene continued to pursue solo efforts, releasing Giving Up the Ghost on 429 Records in April 2008, and made his second visit to Late Night with Conan O'Brien in June 2008, performing \\"Like A Ball & Chain\\". Another song from the album, \\"I Don't Live in a Dream\\", was featured on episodes of the NBC television series Life in November 2008 and ABC's Private Practice in March 2009. In October through November 2009, Jackie Greene played a series of shows with Gov't Mule, culminating at the end of the tour on Halloween at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, PA, during which Jackie played and sang through an entire set of Rolling Stones songs with Gov't Mule. The Jackie Greene Band currently features Nathan Dale on guitar, Jon Cornell on bass, and Fitz Harris on drums. Past members included Jeremy Plog, Steve Taylor, Zack Bowden, Henderson Phillips, Matt McCord, Bruce Spencer, Ben Lefever and Nick Swimley. Greene was a member of Trigger Hippy. In the Spring of 2012 Greene, Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead and Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes embarked on an acoustic tour.

It tells of how a homeless girl becomes a midwife's apprentice‚Äîand establishes a name and a place in the world, and learns to hope and overcome failure. This novel won the John Newbery Medal in 1996. Mary Beth Dunhouse, chair of the Newbery Award Selection Committee, wrote of the book, \\"The reader is drawn in from the first sentence when the author speaks of a 'rotting and moiling heap. 'And this is when the reader meets the central character, Brat--'unwashed, unnourished, unloved, and unlovely... who dreamed of nothing, for she hoped of nothing and expected nothing.' This homeless waif becomes the midwife's apprentice--a person with a name and a place in the world. Medieval England is well-evoked, and readers will find this world so compelling that they will keep turning pages to see what happens next.\\" In an interview in Scholastic Magazine, Ms. Cushman says, \\"The book took about 9 months to write, the same length of time it takes to make a child. Interesting, huh? I had done a lot of research on the Middle Ages for Catherine, Called Birdy, so I knew a lot about the time and place. The research I did was for specific about childbirth, herbs, and healing.\\" Plot In medieval England, a homeless orphan girl who has no name, and can recall being named Brat, attempts to nestle in a warm dung heap on a cold night. She wakes up to the taunts of village boys, and Jane Sharp\\" asks her if she's alive. Jane takes her on as her apprentice, renames her \\"Beetle,\\" but does not teach Beetle about midwifery for fear of competition. Jane is greedy and cruel, but she has a monopoly on her services, and the villagers, unable to take their anger out on the midwife, take it out on Beetle. Beetle goes to the fair in place of Jane Sharp there she is called Alyce so she changes her name Alyce (changing her name from \\"Beetle\\") is friends with a little homeless orphan boy, whom she names Edward, after the King, and tells him to go to the manor to get food and a job. Jane helps a woman in labor with the help of Alyce and word arrives the Lady of the Manor is in labor. Jane abandons the new mother to Alyce's care to the Lady. Alyce is kind to the woman and successfully delivers the baby, and the grateful parents pay her and name the child \\"Alyce Little.\\" A woman's son comes to Alyce asking her to deliver her baby. This is a more difficult birth, Alyce fails and is overwhelmed by her inability to help. Jane sweeps in and presides over the birth, and Alyce flees, not wanting to endure the shame. She leaves the town with her cat. In another town, she comes to an inn where the owner gives Alyce work in exchange for food, and becomes fond of Alyce. A scholar from Oxford, staying for the winter, teaches Alyce how to read. Alyce misses Edward and wants to find out how he is faring. She returns to the village to check on him and finds that he has been supported without working. Their reunion is like that of a brother and sister. Alyce tells him to work properly and she returns to the inn. All she wants is to be a midwife, so she returns to the village with a new sense of self-purpose and asks to be the midwife‚Äôs apprentice again.

Early life Ker was born on 30 April 1680. He was the second son of Robert Ker, 3rd Earl of Roxburghe, and Margaret Hay, daughter of John Hay, 1st Marquess of Tweeddale. He older brother was Robert Ker, 4th Earl of Roxburghe, and his younger brother was The Hon. William Ker, who fought on the Continent under the Duke of Marlborough and was present at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. He served as Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales in 1714, and was a Member of Parliament for Berwick and Dysart Burghs. John became 5th Earl of Roxburghe on the death of his elder brother Robert in 1696. Career In 1704, he was made a Secretary of State of Scotland, and he helped to bring about the union with England, being created Duke of Roxburghe in 1707 for his services in this connection. This was the last creation in the Scottish peerage. On 28 May 1707, he was admitted a FRS. The duke was a representative peer for Scotland in four parliaments. George I made him a privy councillor and Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, and he was loyal to the king during the Jacobite rising in 1715. He served as Secretary of State for Scotland in the British Parliament from 1716 to 1725, but he opposed the malt tax, and in 1725 Sir Robert Walpole procured his dismissal from office. In April 1727, he was one of the six pall-bearers of Sir Isaac Newton's coffin at Westminster Abbey.Notice in London Gazette, 4 April, No. 6569 He was one of the original governors of the Foundling Hospital, a charity created by royal charter on 17 October 1739.

From her first marriage to William Savile, 2nd Marquess of Halifax, she was the mother of Lady Mary Savile (who married Sackville Tufton, 7th Earl of Thanet in 1722) and Lady Dorothy Savile (who married Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington).

He is Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, Fellow of St Cross College, Oxford, Director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, Sir Louis Matheson Distinguished Visiting Professor at Monash University, and Head of the Melbourne‚ÄìOxford Stem Cell Collaboration, which is devoted to examining the ethical implications of cloning and embryonic stem cell research. He is a former editor and current board member of the Journal of Medical Ethics (2001-2004 and 2011-2018), which is ranked as the No.1 journal in bioethics worldwide by Google Scholar Metrics as of 2013. In addition to his background in applied ethics and philosophy, he also has a background in medicine and completed his MBBS (Hons) at Monash University. He completed his PhD at Monash University, under the supervision of philosopher Peter Singer.Savulescu. philosophy.ox.ac.uk  Procreative beneficence  Julian Savulescu coined the phrase procreative beneficence. It is the controversial putative moral obligation of parents in a position to select their children, for instance through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), to favor those expected to have the best life. An argument in favor of this principle is that traits (such as empathy, memory, etc.) are \\"all-purpose means\\" in the sense of being instrumental in realizing whatever life plans the child may come to have. In some of his publications he has argued for the following: #that parents have a responsibility to select the best children they could have, given all of the relevant genetic information available to them, a principle that he extends to the use of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnoses (PGD) in order to determine the intelligence of embryos and possible children; and #that stem cell research is justifiable even if one accepts the view of the embryo as a person. Julian Savulescu also justifies the destruction of embryos and fetuses as a source of organs and tissue for transplantation to adults. In his abstract he argues, \\"The most publicly justifiable application of human cloning, if there is one at all, is to provide self-compatible cells or tissues for medical use, especially transplantation. Some have argued that this raises no new ethical issues above those raised by any form of embryo experimentation. I argue that this research is less morally problematic than other embryo research. Indeed, it is not merely morally permissible but morally required that we employ cloning to produce embryos or fetuses for the sake of providing cells, tissues or even organs for therapy, followed by abortion of the embryo or fetus.\\" He argues that if it is permissible to destroy fetuses, for social reasons, or no reasons at all, it must be justifiable to destroy them to save lives. Further, as editor of the Journal of Medical Ethics, he published, in 2012, an article by two Italian academics which stated that a new-born baby is effectively no different from a foetus, is not a \\"person\\" and, morally, could be killed at the decision of the parents etc. Along with neuro-ethicist Guy Kahane, Savulescu's article \\"Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness\\" appears to be the first mainstream publication to argue that increased evidence of consciousness in patients diagnosed with being in persistent vegetative state actually supports withdrawing or withholding care. In 2009, Professor Savulescu presented a paper at the ‚ÄôFestival of Dangerous Ideas,‚Äô held at the Sydney Opera House in October 2009, entitled \\"Unfit for Life: Genetically Enhance Humanity or Face Extinction,\\" which can be seen on Vimeo.Genetically enhance humanity or face extinction ‚Äì PART 1 on Vimeo. Vimeo.com (9 November 2009). Retrieved on 2016-05-16. Savulescu argues that humanity is on the brink of disappearing in a metaphorical ‚ÄòBermuda Triangle‚Äô unless humans are willing to undergo 'moral enhancement'.  Reception  Walter Veit has gone further than Savulescu and argued that because there is no intrinsic moral difference between 'creating' and 'choosing' a life, eugenics becomes a natural consequence of procreative beneficence. If parents have a moral obligation to create children likely to have the best possible life, they should prefer to have children that have been genetically engineered for an optimal chance at such a life, even if those children bear little or no genetic relation to them. Rebecca Bennett, however, criticizes Savulescu's argument. Bennett argues that \\"the chances of any particular individual being born is spectacularly unlikely, given the infinite number of variables that had to be in place for this to happen. In order for any particular individual to exist, that individual's parents have to have been created in the first place, they have to meet at the right time and conceive us at a particular time to enable that particular sperm to fuse with that particular egg. Thus, it is clear that all sorts of things, any change in society, will effect who is born.\\". According to Bennett, this means that no- one is actually harmed if one does not select the best offspring, as the individuals born could not have had any other, worse life as they would otherwise never have been born - \\"choosing worthwhile but impaired lives harms no-one and is thus not less preferable\\", as Bennett puts it. Bennett argues that while advocates of procreative beneficence could appeal to impersonal harm, which is where one should aim to ensure the maximum possible potential quality of life and thus embryos without or with the least impairments should be selected (as the impersonal total quality of life will be improved), this argument is flawed on two counts. Firstly on an intuitive level, Bennett questions if benefit or harm that doesn't affect anyone (i.e it is impersonal) should be worthy of consideration as no actual people will gain or lose anything. Secondly and on a theoretical level, Bennett argues that attempting to increase the sum total impersonal happiness (or decrease impersonal harm) can lead to repugnant conclusions, such as being obliged to produce as many offspring as possible to bring more people into the world to raise the level of impersonal happiness, even if the quality of life of individuals suffers for it due to scarcity and overcrowding. Bennett argues that this conclusion is repugnant because \\"it cares little about what we normally regard as morally important: the welfare of individual people\\". Norbert Paulo criticised Savulescu's argument for moral enhancement, arguing that if democratic governments had to morally enhance their populations because the majoritarian population are morally deficient, they could not be legitimate as they manipulated the population's will. Thus in Paulo's view, those advocating large-scale, state-driven and partially mandatory moral enhancement are advocating a non-democratic order.Paulo, Norbert, and Jan Christoph Bublitz. \\"How (not) to argue for moral enhancement: Reflections on a decade of debate.\\" Topoi 38, no. 1 (2019): 95-109.

Hinduism A statue of Nagaraja Hindu texts refer to three main beings by this title: Shesha, Takshaka and Vasuki. All of them are the children of rishi Kashyapa and Kadru. Shesha, Vasuki, and Takshaka Shesha, also sometimes known as Ananta, is the eldest brother: a devotee of Vishnu, he represents the friendly aspect of snakes, as they save food from rodents. Vishnu is always on continuous meditation (Yoganidra) with Ananta forming a bed for him; thus, this posture is called Ananta-Sayana. Vasuki, the king of Nagas is a devotee of Shiva, who always wears the nƒÅga around his neck. Vasuki also has a sister named Manasa. Takshaka represents the dangerous aspect of snakes, as they are feared because of their venom. Temples An ancient temple of Nagraj or snake god Vasuki is in Gujarat's surendranagar district's \\"Thangadh\\" town. Thangadh's land is also known as land of snake. People do worship Vasuki nag as the rustic god of Thangadh. At Nagercoil in Kanniyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, a temple dedicated to Nagaraja exists. There is another famous temple named Mannarasala in Alleppey district of Kerala. The deity in this temple embodies both Anantha and Vasuki into one. A temple devoted to nagraja exists in kaippattoor of Ernakulam district in Kerala, India. It is known as thekkanattil nagaraja kshetram. A temple devoted to Nagaraja exists in Poojappura of Thiruvananthapuram District in Kerala, India. It is known as Poojappura Nagarukavu Temple. The uniqueness of this temple is that here the family of the Nagaraja including Nagaramma (Queen of Naga) and Nagakanya (Princess of the Naga kingdom) is placed inside a single temple. Also at Thiruvananthapuram is an ancient abode of Serpent Wisdom known as Thuppanathu Kavu, located at Vazhamuttam. The three serpent deities evoked in this ancient temple are Nagaraja Vasuki (relating to Lord Shiva), Naga Yakshi (Serpent Queen/ wife of Nagaraja) and Naga Kanyaka. Turmeric powder, Noorum Paalum and Naagaroottu are offered to them. Accompanied by the Naga Gods and Goddesses at Thuppanathu Kavu are the goddess Vanadurga and the goddess Rajarajeswari. Kukke Subramanya is a Hindu temple located in the village of Subramanya, Karnataka. In this temple Kartikeya is worshipped as Subramanya, lord of all serpents. The epics relate that the divine serpent Vasuki and other serpents found refuge under Subramanya when threatened by Garuda.

For a heat engine, thermal efficiency is the fraction of the energy added by heat (primary energy) that is converted to net work output (secondary energy). In the case of a refrigeration or heat pump cycle, thermal efficiency is the ratio of net heat output for heating, or removal for cooling, to energy input (the coefficient of performance). Overview Output (mechanical) energy is always lower than input energy In general, energy conversion efficiency is the ratio between the useful output of a device and the input, in energy terms. For thermal efficiency, the input, Q_{\\\\rm in}, to the device is heat, or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed. The desired output is mechanical work, W_{\\\\rm out}, or heat, Q_{\\\\rm out}, or possibly both. Because the input heat normally has a real financial cost, a memorable, generic definition of thermal efficiency isFundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, by Howell and Buckius, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1987 :\\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\text{benefit}}{\\\\text{cost}}. From the first law of thermodynamics, the energy output cannot exceed the input, and by the second law of thermodynamics it cannot be equal in a non-ideal process, so :0 \\\\le \\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} < 1 When expressed as a percentage, the thermal efficiency must be between 0% and 100%. Efficiency is typically less than 100% because there are inefficiencies such as friction and heat loss that convert the energy into alternative forms. For example, a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25% efficiency, and a large coal-fuelled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46%, advances in Formula 1 motorsport regulations have pushed teams to develop highly efficient power units which peak around 45‚Äì50% thermal efficiency. The largest diesel engine in the world peaks at 51.7%. In a combined cycle plant, thermal efficiencies are approaching 60%.GE Power‚Äôs H Series Turbine Such a real-world value may be used as a figure of merit for the device. For engines where a fuel is burned there are two types of thermal efficiency: indicated thermal efficiency and brake thermal efficiency.The Internal Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice: Vol. 1 - 2nd Edition, Revised, MIT Press, 1985, Charles Fayette Taylor - Equation 1-4, page 9 This efficiency is only appropriate when comparing similar types or similar devices. For other systems the specifics of the calculations of efficiency vary but the non dimensional input is still the same. Efficiency = Output energy / input energy Heat engines Heat engines transform thermal energy, or heat, Qin into mechanical energy, or work, Wout. They cannot do this task perfectly, so some of the input heat energy is not converted into work, but is dissipated as waste heat Qout into the environment :Q_{in} = W_{\\\\rm out} + Q_{\\\\rm out} \\\\, The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of heat energy that is transformed into work. Thermal efficiency is defined as :\\\\eta_{ \\\\rm th} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{W_{\\\\rm out}}{Q_{\\\\rm in}} = \\\\frac{ {Q_{\\\\rm in}} - Q_{\\\\rm out}} {Q_{\\\\rm in}} = 1 - \\\\frac{Q_{\\\\rm out}}{Q_{\\\\rm in}} The efficiency of even the best heat engines is low; usually below 50% and often far below. So the energy lost to the environment by heat engines is a major waste of energy resources. Since a large fraction of the fuels produced worldwide go to powering heat engines, perhaps up to half of the useful energy produced worldwide is wasted in engine inefficiency, although modern cogeneration, combined cycle and energy recycling schemes are beginning to use this heat for other purposes. This inefficiency can be attributed to three causes. There is an overall theoretical limit to the efficiency of any heat engine due to temperature, called the Carnot efficiency. Second, specific types of engines have lower limits on their efficiency due to the inherent irreversibility of the engine cycle they use. Thirdly, the nonideal behavior of real engines, such as mechanical friction and losses in the combustion process causes further efficiency losses. =Carnot efficiency= The second law of thermodynamics puts a fundamental limit on the thermal efficiency of all heat engines. Even an ideal, frictionless engine can't convert anywhere near 100% of its input heat into work. The limiting factors are the temperature at which the heat enters the engine, T_{\\\\rm H}\\\\,, and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat, T_{\\\\rm C}\\\\,, measured in an absolute scale, such as the Kelvin or Rankine scale. From Carnot's theorem, for any engine working between these two temperatures: :\\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} \\\\le 1 - \\\\frac{T_{\\\\rm C}}{T_{\\\\rm H}} \\\\, This limiting value is called the Carnot cycle efficiency because it is the efficiency of an unattainable, ideal, reversible engine cycle called the Carnot cycle. No device converting heat into mechanical energy, regardless of its construction, can exceed this efficiency. Examples of T_{\\\\rm H}\\\\, are the temperature of hot steam entering the turbine of a steam power plant, or the temperature at which the fuel burns in an internal combustion engine. T_{\\\\rm C}\\\\, is usually the ambient temperature where the engine is located, or the temperature of a lake or river into which the waste heat is discharged. For example, if an automobile engine burns gasoline at a temperature of T_{\\\\rm H} = 816^\\\\circ \\\\text{C} = 1500^\\\\circ \\\\text{F} = 1089 \\\\text{K}\\\\, and the ambient temperature is T_{\\\\rm C} = 21^\\\\circ \\\\text{C} = 70^\\\\circ \\\\text{F} = 294 \\\\text{K}\\\\,, then its maximum possible efficiency is: :\\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} \\\\le \\\\left (1 - \\\\frac{294 K}{1089 K} \\\\right ) 100\\\\% = 73.0\\\\% It can be seen that since T_{\\\\rm C}\\\\, is fixed by the environment, the only way for a designer to increase the Carnot efficiency of an engine is to increase T_{\\\\rm H}\\\\,, the temperature at which the heat is added to the engine. The efficiency of ordinary heat engines also generally increases with operating temperature, and advanced structural materials that allow engines to operate at higher temperatures is an active area of research. Due to the other causes detailed below, practical engines have efficiencies far below the Carnot limit. For example, the average automobile engine is less than 35% efficient. Carnot's theorem applies to thermodynamic cycles, where thermal energy is converted to mechanical work. Devices that convert a fuel's chemical energy directly into electrical work, such as fuel cells, can exceed the Carnot efficiency. =Engine cycle efficiency= The Carnot cycle is reversible and thus represents the upper limit on efficiency of an engine cycle. Practical engine cycles are irreversible and thus have inherently lower efficiency than the Carnot efficiency when operated between the same temperatures T_{\\\\rm H}\\\\, and T_{\\\\rm C}\\\\,. One of the factors determining efficiency is how heat is added to the working fluid in the cycle, and how it is removed. The Carnot cycle achieves maximum efficiency because all the heat is added to the working fluid at the maximum temperature T_{\\\\rm H}\\\\,, and removed at the minimum temperature T_{\\\\rm C}\\\\,. In contrast, in an internal combustion engine, the temperature of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder is nowhere near its peak temperature as the fuel starts to burn, and only reaches the peak temperature as all the fuel is consumed, so the average temperature at which heat is added is lower, reducing efficiency. An important parameter in the efficiency of combustion engines is the specific heat ratio of the air-fuel mixture, Œ≥. This varies somewhat with the fuel, but is generally close to the air value of 1.4. This standard value is usually used in the engine cycle equations below, and when this approximation is made the cycle is called an air-standard cycle. *Otto cycle: automobiles The Otto cycle is the name for the cycle used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines such as gasoline and hydrogen fuelled automobile engines. Its theoretical efficiency depends on the compression ratio r of the engine and the specific heat ratio Œ≥ of the gas in the combustion chamber. :\\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{r^{\\\\gamma-1}}\\\\, :Thus, the efficiency increases with the compression ratio. However the compression ratio of Otto cycle engines is limited by the need to prevent the uncontrolled combustion known as knocking. Modern engines have compression ratios in the range 8 to 11, resulting in ideal cycle efficiencies of 56% to 61%. *Diesel cycle: trucks and trains In the Diesel cycle used in diesel truck and train engines, the fuel is ignited by compression in the cylinder. The efficiency of the Diesel cycle is dependent on r and Œ≥ like the Otto cycle, and also by the cutoff ratio, rc, which is the ratio of the cylinder volume at the beginning and end of the combustion process: :\\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} = 1-\\\\frac{r^{1-\\\\gamma}(r_{\\\\rm c}^\\\\gamma - 1)}{\\\\gamma(r_{\\\\rm c} - 1)} \\\\, :The Diesel cycle is less efficient than the Otto cycle when using the same compression ratio. However, practical Diesel engines are 30% - 35% more efficient than gasoline engines. This is because, since the fuel is not introduced to the combustion chamber until it is required for ignition, the compression ratio is not limited by the need to avoid knocking, so higher ratios are used than in spark ignition engines. *Rankine cycle: steam power plants The Rankine cycle is the cycle used in steam turbine power plants. The overwhelming majority of the world's electric power is produced with this cycle. Since the cycle's working fluid, water, changes from liquid to vapor and back during the cycle, their efficiencies depend on the thermodynamic properties of water. The thermal efficiency of modern steam turbine plants with reheat cycles can reach 47%, and in combined cycle plants, in which a steam turbine is powered by exhaust heat from a gas turbine, it can approach 60%. *Brayton cycle: gas turbines and jet engines The Brayton cycle is the cycle used in gas turbines and jet engines. It consists of a compressor that increases pressure of the incoming air, then fuel is continuously added to the flow and burned, and the hot exhaust gasses are expanded in a turbine. The efficiency depends largely on the ratio of the pressure inside the combustion chamber p2 to the pressure outside p1 :\\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} = 1 - \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\\\bigg)^\\\\frac{1-\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma} \\\\, =Other inefficiencies= One should not confuse thermal efficiency with other efficiencies that are used when discussing engines. The above efficiency formulas are based on simple idealized mathematical models of engines, with no friction and working fluids that obey simple thermodynamic rules called the ideal gas law. Real engines have many departures from ideal behavior that waste energy, reducing actual efficiencies below the theoretical values given above. Examples are: *friction of moving parts *inefficient combustion *heat loss from the combustion chamber *departure of the working fluid from the thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas *aerodynamic drag of air moving through the engine *energy used by auxiliary equipment like oil and water pumps. *inefficient compressors and turbines *imperfect valve timing These factors may be accounted when analyzing thermodynamic cycles, however discussion of how to do so is outside the scope of this article. Energy conversion For a device that converts energy from another form into thermal energy (such as an electric heater, boiler, or furnace), the thermal efficiency is :\\\\eta_{\\\\rm th} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{Q_{\\\\rm out}}{Q_{\\\\rm in}} where the Q quantities are heat-equivalent values. So, for a boiler that produces 210 kW (or 700,000 BTU/h) output for each 300 kW (or 1,000,000 BTU/h) heat-equivalent input, its thermal efficiency is 210/300 = 0.70, or 70%. This means that 30% of the energy is lost to the environment. An electric resistance heater has a thermal efficiency close to 100%. When comparing heating units, such as a highly efficient electric resistance heater to an 80% efficient natural gas- fuelled furnace, an economic analysis is needed to determine the most cost- effective choice. =Effects of fuel heating value= The heating value of a fuel is the amount of heat released during an exothermic reaction (e.g., combustion) and is a characteristic of each substance. It is measured in units of energy per unit of the substance, usually mass, such as: kJ/kg, J/mol. The heating value for fuels is expressed as the HHV, LHV, or GHV to distinguish treatment of the heat of phase changes: * Higher heating value (HHV) is determined by bringing all the products of combustion back to the original pre-combustion temperature, and in particular condensing any vapor produced. This is the same as the thermodynamic heat of combustion. * Lower heating value (LHV) (or net calorific value) is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporization of the water vapor from the higher heating value. The energy required to vaporize the water therefore is not realized as heat. * Gross heating value accounts for water in the exhaust leaving as vapor, and includes liquid water in the fuel prior to combustion. This value is important for fuels like wood or coal, which will usually contain some amount of water prior to burning. Which definition of heating value is being used significantly affects any quoted efficiency. Not stating whether an efficiency is HHV or LHV renders such numbers very misleading. Heat pumps and refrigerators Heat pumps, refrigerators and air conditioners use work to move heat from a colder to a warmer place, so their function is the opposite of a heat engine. The work energy (Win) that is applied to them is converted into heat, and the sum of this energy and the heat energy that is moved from the cold reservoir (QC) is equal to the total heat energy added to the hot reservoir (QH) :Q_{\\\\rm H} = Q_{\\\\rm C} + W_{\\\\rm in} \\\\, Their efficiency is measured by a coefficient of performance (COP). Heat pumps are measured by the efficiency with which they add heat to the hot reservoir, COPheating; refrigerators and air conditioners by the efficiency with which they remove heat from the cold interior, COPcooling: :\\\\mathrm{COP}_{\\\\mathrm{heating}} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{Q_{\\\\rm H}}{W_{\\\\rm in}}\\\\, :\\\\mathrm{COP}_{\\\\mathrm{cooling}} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{Q_{\\\\rm C}}{W_{\\\\rm in}}\\\\, The reason the term \\"coefficient of performance\\" is used instead of \\"efficiency\\" is that, since these devices are moving heat, not creating it, the amount of heat they move can be greater than the input work, so the COP can be greater than 1 (100%). Therefore, heat pumps can be a more efficient way of heating than simply converting the input work into heat, as in an electric heater or furnace. Since they are heat engines, these devices are also limited by Carnot's theorem. The limiting value of the Carnot 'efficiency' for these processes, with the equality theoretically achievable only with an ideal 'reversible' cycle, is: :\\\\mathrm{COP}_{\\\\mathrm{heating}} \\\\le \\\\frac{T_{\\\\rm H}}{T_{\\\\rm H} - T_{\\\\rm C}}=\\\\mathrm{COP}_\\\\mathrm{heating,carnot} :\\\\mathrm{COP}_{\\\\mathrm{cooling}} \\\\le \\\\frac{T_{\\\\rm C}}{T_{\\\\rm H} - T_{\\\\rm C}}=\\\\mathrm{COP}_\\\\mathrm{cooling,carnot} The same device used between the same temperatures is more efficient when considered as a heat pump than when considered as a refrigerator: :\\\\mathrm{COP}_{\\\\mathrm{heating}} - \\\\mathrm{COP}_{\\\\mathrm{cooling}} = 1\\\\, This is because when heating, the work used to run the device is converted to heat and adds to the desired effect, whereas if the desired effect is cooling the heat resulting from the input work is just an unwanted by-product. Sometimes, the term efficiency is used for the ratio of the achieved COP to the Carnot COP, which can not exceed 100%. Energy efficiency The 'thermal efficiency' is sometimes called the energy efficiency. In the United States, in everyday usage the SEER is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices, as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode. For energy- conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated, e.g., 'this furnace is 90% efficient', but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the annual fuel use efficiency (AFUE).HVAC Systems and Equipment volume of the ASHRAE Handbook, ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, US, 2004 =Heat exchangers= A counter flow heat exchanger is the most efficient type of heat exchanger in transferring heat energy from one circuit to the other. However, for a more complete picture of heat exchanger efficiency, exergetic considerations must be taken into account. Thermal efficiencies of an internal combustion engine are typically higher than that of external combustion engines.

The fort's ruins and the village site are located about west of Col√≥n, on a promontory overlooking the mouth of the Chagres River. 16th and 17th centuries: Discovery and fortification In 1502, during his fourth and final voyage, Christopher Columbus discovered the Chagres River. By 1534, the Monarchy of Spain had, following its conquest of Peru, established a rainy-season gold route over the isthmus of Panama ‚ÄîCamino Real de Cruces‚Äî using mule trains and the Chagres River. The trail connected the Pacific port of Panama City to the mouth of the Chagres, from whence Peru's plunder would sail to Spain's storehouses in the leading Atlantic ports of the isthmus: Nombre de Dios, at first; and, later, Portobelo. (The dry-season, overland route‚Äîthe Camino Real‚Äîconnected Panama City with those ports directly.)Weaver and Bauer, pp. 14-16 Attracted to the treasure, pirates began attacking Panama's coast around 1560. To protect the Atlantic terminus of Las Cruces Trail (Camino Real de Cruces), Spain built Fort San Lorenzo at the Chagres River's mouth. The work began in 1598 by order of King Philip II. From 1587 to 1599, the fortifications evolved into a sea-level battery and they were completed in 1601. The plans of the massive fortress were made by the Italian engineer Baptist Antonelli. The castle of San Lorenzo was built on top of a high reef, in a position that dominated the entrance of the Chagres River. In 1670, buccaneer Henry Morgan ordered an attack that left Fort San Lorenzo in ruins. He invaded Panama City the following year, using San Lorenzo as his base of operations. In the 1680s, the Spanish constructed a new fort above the water. Set on a cliff overlooking the entrance to the harbor, the fort was protected on the landward side by a dry moat with a drawbridge. During this time, the town of Chagres was established under the protection of the fort.Weaver and Bauer, pp. 16-17 18th and 19th centuries: Decline and rebirth In 1739 and 1740, British Admiral Edward Vernon attacked the Spanish fortifications at Portobelo and Chagres. With the destruction of Portobelo's fort, Spain abandoned trade there, instead strengthening its fortifications at Chagres,Minter, p. 189 and, upstream, Gatun.Weaver and Bauer, p. 16 With the decline of Portobelo, Chagres surpassed it as the chief Atlantic port of the isthmus. By the middle of the 18th century, however, the Spanish had largely abandoned both of the old trails over the isthmus, preferring to sail around the tip of South America at Cape Horn. For over a century, Fort San Lorenzo was used as a prison. The 1848 finding of gold in California stimulated new vitality at the mouth of the Chagres River. Westbound prospectors who preferred to avoid crossing the \\"Great American Desert\\" or rounding Cape Horn would follow the old path of the Las Cruces Trail, beginning their transcontinental journey at \\"Yankee Town\\"Weaver and Bauer, p. 17 or \\"Yanqui Chagres\\"Minter, p. 238‚Äîthe wild-west boomtown that sprang up on the bank opposite the original village and fortress. The rebirth of Chagres' importance was short-lived. Although the advent of steamboat service on the Chagres River had, by 1853, shortened the time required to cross the isthmus from several days to about twelve hours, the 1855 completion of the Panama Railway further reduced the transcontinental travel time to about three hours.Minter, pp. 210-11, 219, 281 As a result, the railway‚Äôs Atlantic terminus, Col√≥n, became Panama's Atlantic port, and Chagres receded from importance. 20th century: Canal Zone to protected area The construction of the Panama Canal, completed in 1914, required the construction of the massive Gatun Dam, about upriver from Chagres, permanently sealing off the river from inland trade. Although Chagres fell outside the original boundary of the Panama Canal Zone, that zone expanded in 1916 to include the mouth of Chagres River. The town of Chagres‚Äîwhich, by then, had only 96 houses and 400 to 500 inhabitants‚Äîwas then \\"depopulated,\\" and its former residents were resettled to Nuevo Chagres, located about to the southwest, along the coast.Weaver and Bauer, p. 3 Fort San Lorenzo has been designated as government-protected since 1908. Currently, the ruins of Fort San Lorenzo and the Chagres village site are contained within the of the San Lorenzo Protected Area, all former Canal Zone territory.Weaver and Bauer, pp. 2, 4 In 1980, UNESCO declared Fort San Lorenzo, together with the fortified town of Portobelo about to the northeast, to be a World Heritage Site under the name, \\"Fortifications on the Caribbean Side of Panama.\\" The organization describes the fortifications as follows: \\"Magnificent examples of 17th- and 18th-century military architecture, these Panamanian forts on the Caribbean coast form part of the defence system built by the Spanish Crown to protect transatlantic trade.\\"  Images  Fort San Lorenzo 05.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 01.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 02.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 04.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 09.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 13.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 15.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 14.jpg Fort San Lorenzo 16.jpg In fiction Chagres features prominently in The Adventures & Brave Deeds Of The Ship's Cat On The Spanish Maine: Together With The Most Lamentable Losse Of The Alcestis & Triumphant Firing Of The Port Of Chagres, a children's book by Richard Adams.

The station's mission is to serve groups in its listening area who are underrepresented on other local radio stations and to provide access to the airwaves for people who have unconventional or controversial tastes and points of view. It broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and has been on the air since 1968. KBOO is supported financially by donations from members and a small endowment. As of February 2006, the station had about 6,800 members. The station runs pledge drives twice each year. The annual KBOO budget in 2006 was about $900,000. The station is run by nine paid staff members and several hundred volunteers. Its offices and broadcast studios are in a converted warehouse in inner Southeast Portland, purchased in 1982. Its main transmitter power output is 10,000 watts (approximately 26,500 watts after antenna gain) in Portland, KBOO also has two repeater stations ‚Äì in Philomath, Oregon (at 104.3 FM) and the Columbia River Gorge (at 91.9 FM) ‚Äì which extend its broadcast area to include the Columbia River Gorge and most of the Willamette Valley. History =Early Days (1964-1971)= A group of Portlanders organized themselves as Portland Listener Supported Radio in 1964. They approached Lorenzo Milam, a former volunteer at Pacifica Radio's KPFA, who helped start KRAB, a now-defunct community station in Seattle. Milam agreed to help them organize a station, and after a series of meetings, Portland Listener Supported Radio applied for a license for a Portland radio station. In time, Milam helped several other communities start their own stations, including KCHU, WAIF, WORT, KDNA, KTAO, and KUSP. Milam asked KRAB volunteer David Calhoun if he'd be willing to help organize the new station in Portland. Calhoun, an ex-monk and third-year medical student, packed his VW with a transmitter from Seattle, and moved south. Sleeping on couches and bumming meals, Calhoun and other volunteers including Gray Haertig (who continues to volunteer to this day) put together what was needed for a community radio station. A basement room was donated on Third and Salmon Streets, in downtown Portland. The space was barely big enough for two tape recorders, one turntable, and Calhoun. A diverse mix of about thirty volunteers came together to help out, including society women, movement radicals, professional broadcast engineers, and musicians. Selecting call letters referencing a strain of marijuana called \\"Berkeley Boo\\", KBOO Community Radio was on the air in June 1968, at a cost of less than $4,000. The total monthly station budget was about $50. The total output was only ten watts - not quite that of a light bulb. A new and important force on Portland's airwaves was born. Initially, KBOO was on the air whenever there was a volunteer to flip a switch and activate the repeater signal from KRAB. But almost immediately, the station began to grow. KBOO volunteers lugged big Ampex tape recorders to concerts, political events, and neighborhood meetings; nationally recognized artists and activists were brought into the KBOO studio. Local poets also discovered they had an electronic outlet. By the summer of 1970, a used 1,000-watt transmitter was installed, enabling KBOO's audience and subscriptions to grow. KBOO could be heard in much of Northwest Oregon. After three years, KBOO outgrew its studio, and moved to a storefront on SE Belmont Street near 31st Avenue. Walls of the makeshift studios were lined with egg cartons for sound insulation. Two desks were shared by everyone. =Incorporation and stability (1972-1982)= By 1972, the non-profit KBOO Foundation was born, with an interim five-member Board of Directors. The umbilical cord to KRAB was being cut. By 1973, the staff had grown to five, with about 50 active volunteers. About 600 subscribers donated an average of $20 a year. Station Manager John Ross got an $80,000 federal grant to help purchase equipment. In 1975, the 800-strong KBOO Foundation elected its first Board of Directors. The KBOO Foundation and its officers got the license and ownership of the station. KBOO became fully independent of KRAB and its parent, the Jack Straw Memorial Foundation. After 10 years, KBOO had come of age. The station moved again, in 1977, to SW Yamhill Street, and soon expanded broadcasting to 24 hours a day on a regularly scheduled basis. KBOO was broadcasting at 12,500 watts. Rapid growth came to KBOO in its new downtown location. Subscribers soared from 1,200 in early 1978 to well above 2,000 by 1980. About 300 volunteers gave KBOO one of the stronger volunteer programs in the nation. In 1981, urban renewal in downtown Portland forced a search for a new home. KBOO found its present location at 20 SE 8th Avenue (the little robin egg blue building half a block south of East Burnside Street behind the Jupiter Hotel and Doug Fir Lounge). Through a massive volunteer effort, a new station was built in 1982 in an empty warehouse. For the first time, KBOO would own its own home. =Expansion (1982-present)= KBOO's offices and studios in Portland. In the early '80s, KBOO broadened its commitment to multicultural programming. New Spanish and Asian-language programs were added. A strip of African-American musical programming was added in 1981. A Hispanic strip followed in 1984. News and Public Affairs Director Ross Reynolds and volunteers teamed up to organize a nightly newscast, supplemented by a new wire service and national newscast from Pacifica Radio, which proudly continues to air to this day. A new station, KMUN, was launched in Astoria through KBOO's help, much as KRAB had nurtured KBOO. Funds were raised to purchase the new building and KBOO was in the black for the first time in memory. In 1986, the building was purchased. Power was boosted to 23 kW, and KBOO began broadcasting in stereo for the first time. A major federal grant in 1987 allowed purchase of new studio equipment. A satellite dish was added on the roof, and the station bought a remote transmitter, allowing live remote broadcasts of community events. In the early 1990s, KBOO set up translators in Corvallis (broadcasting at 100.7 FM) and in White Salmon, Washington (broadcasting at 91.9 FM), allowing KBOO's signal to be received from the very northern tip of Eugene to The Dalles, on a good day. In 2013, the Corvallis translator moved slightly, to Philomath, where it still reaches Corvallis and now parts of Eugene, at 104.3 FM. In the summer of 1991, KBOO moved its transmitter to a new location on the KGON tower (also known as Stonehenge) on Portland's West Hills. This increase of gave KBOO much greater range. KBOO's effective radiated power was boosted to 26.5 kW. Reports from jubilant listeners came in from the coast and outskirts of Eugene, saying they were hearing KBOO clearly for the first time. Programming KBOO offers a wide spectrum of programming on a regular basis, as well as annual and one-time special event programming. Regular programs range from music to public affairs. KBOO's public affairs programming offers morning talk shows, daytime cultural programs, and a nightly volunteer-produced evening newscast. In addition to these local programs, KBOO also broadcasts a few syndicated programs, such as Democracy Now! and Hard Knock Radio. Music programs, which cover a vast array of genres from hip-hop, rock, electronica, experimental, folk, world and ethnic, can be heard from noon to 4pm each weekday, as well as most evenings, late nights and weekends. In addition, KBOO also offers radio theater programs every Monday night, usually at 11pm, including The Ubu Hour, Sudden Radio Project, Gremlin Time and Sub-Human Intellect Theater, with each program alternating from week-to-week, producing one episode per month. Special programming events have included live remote broadcasts of music festivals such as PDX Pop Now! and the annual Waterfront Blues Festival. According to the KBOO Programming Charter, KBOO shall fill the needs that other media outlets do not, \\"providing programming to diverse communities and unserved or underserved groups\\" and \\"shall provide access and training to those communities.\\" KBOO hosted the Grassroots Radio Coalition's 13th annual Grassroots Radio Conference. The conference was held July 24‚Äì27, 2008, at Portland State University's Native American Student and Community Center. It was co-sponsored by KBOO, KPSU, and KPCN-LP. \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" As a listener-funded station, KBOO runs a variety of fundraising offers. Once, they promised for a donation of $10,000 the station would never play \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" again. After his last set at the Aladdin Theater, Robert Plant was driving his rental car to the Oregon Coast and station-surfing, looking for non-mainstream music. That is, of course, a KBOO specialty, and the offer was repeated while Plant was lingering on the station. He liked the idea and decided to accept. He pulled over to use a pay-phone to call and make a $10,000 pledge, which he says he did using the credit card of Atco Records president Herb Abramson. During an interview in which Plant confirmed the story, he also said that he liked the song well enough, and of course it has been very very good to him‚Ä¶ \\"‚Ä¶but don‚Äôt you know, I‚Äôve heard it.\\" See also *List of community radio stations in the United States References External links   * Community radio stations in the United States BOO Radio stations established in 1968 1968 establishments in Oregon ","title":"KBOO"},{"id":"4024142","text":"Cramp-rings are rings anciently worn as a cure for cramp and \\"falling- sickness\\" or epilepsy. The legend is that the first one was presented to Edward the Confessor by a pilgrim on his return from Jerusalem, its miraculous properties being explained to the king. At his death it passed into the keeping of the abbot of Westminster, by whom it was used medically and was known as St Edwards Ring. From that time the belief grew that the successors of Edward inherited his powers, and that the rings blessed by them worked cures. Hence arose the custom for the successive sovereigns of England each year on Good Friday formally to bless a number of cramp-rings. A service was held; prayers and psalms were said; and holy water, which had been blessed in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, was poured over the rings, which were always of gold or silver, and made from the metal that the king offered to the Cross on Good Friday. The ceremony survived to the reign of Mary I, but the belief in the curative powers of similar circlets of sacred metal has lasted to the present day.

(, ) is a valley in the municipality of Rana in Nordland county, Norway. It reaches from just below the eastern Saltfjellet plateau about south of the Arctic circle. The mountain Bolna is situated in the uppermost boundary of the valley which then proceeds to the southwest all the way down to the Ranfjorden. Some of the minor side valleys include Plurdalen, R√∏vassdalen, Bj√∏ll√•dalen, Gr√∏nfjelldalen and Virvassdalen. The valley also includes several villages such as Krokstrand, Bj√∏ll√•nes, Storvoll, Dunderland, Eiter√•, Nevernes, Storforshei, Nevermoen and R√∏ssvoll. Eiter√• river, Dunderland Valley. July 2007 Ranelva river at Storvoll in Dunderland Valley; May 2007 The European route E6 highway passes through the Dunderland Valley, following the Ranelva river. The Illh√∏llia Tunnel on the E6 highway, between Nevermoen and R√∏ssvoll, was opened in 2002. The Nordland Line also follows the river through the valley. Today, the valley only houses a small number of people, and it has two stations on the Nordland Line: Dunderland Station and Bolna Station. Geology The mountain rocks in the Dunderland Valley are a caledonian shale, known from its occurrences of iron ore, mica schist, and marble. Its mining industry has produced Fauske marble, also present in Fauske municipality to the north. At Storforshei, there has been a large-scale iron mining industry. There are also pyrite mines. The valley has several stalactite caverns in the limestone, with some of the tributary streams flowing for considerable distances underground. From the upper parts of the Dunderland Valley, a sequestered bridle-path runs from Bolna to Saltdal on the Skjerstadfjord, with a branch through the magnificent Junkerdal National Park. =Mining= Deposits of iron ore have been known in this area since 1799. The Dunderland Iron Ore Company mined here during several operative periods, the first one starting in 1902. The river Ranelva provided water power to the miners. The mining company was closed in 1947. Since 1937, Rana Gruber has mined iron ore. Norsk Jernverk was established in 1946, and it began mining magnetite and hematite from the iron ore in 1964. History =Recent history= This valley was the site to several accidents and recorded events in Norwegian history. During the World War II, Nazis had several concentration camps in the valley. They mainly housed Polish and Russian prisoners, who were used to build the Nordland Line from Trondheim. The stretch of railway passing through Saltfjellet was extremely brutal and many lost their lives building this. The German troops disposed the bodies the majority of the sick/diseased prisoners in the river Ranelva which flows through the Dunderland Valley. The strong currents made it almost impossible to recover anyone. In 1948, the Dunderlandsdal accident occurred, it was one of the worst bus accidents in Norwegian history to date. For the S√°mi, the valley has a special symbolic value due to a tragic incident that occurred about one hundred years ago. In the early 1900s a bus returning from a S√°mi conference in Troms√∏ drove off the road and crashed into the Ranelva river at the bottom of the valley. Of the 23 people on board, 16 were killed and 4 were never found. Most of the people aboard the bus died, and thus the Southern S√°mi people lost most of their political leaders in one single blow. There is a memorial that was built on the site in 1950 where the bus ran off the road. It is somewhat hidden in the forest, but accessible from the road by a small stairway. In 1953, a family tragedy struck the valley. A family was found slaughtered at a remote farm. A young girl at the age of 6 and her mother were found killed in the barn. The father was found hung in the same barn. In 1995, another tragic event hit the valley. During a Boy Scout camp at an old farm, a 12-year-old girl disappeared. The girl was from the town of Troms√∏ in Northern Norway. The event was widely covered in Norwegian press. Crews searched for her for two years, but all they found was her backpack lying alongside the Ranelva river. =Stone Age settlements= There have been settlements in the Dunderland Valley since the Stone Age. In the summer of 2003, a Danish tourist discovered a battle axe (Streitaxe) close to the river Eiter√•. The axe was delivered to the Cultural Department of the Rana Museum on 1 July 2004. This is the first discovery of the battle axe culture in the inner parts of Northern Norway. In 1913, a long axe from the same cultural horizon was discovered on Brattland in Utskarpen. The axe is a \\"boat- axe\\" of Swedish-Norwegian type from about 2800--2400 BC. It was not a functional tool, but rather a dignity symbol of worthiness and a high social class. It may have belonged to a local chieftain. The stripe on the backside of the axe resembles an edge from moulding, and is an imitation of moulded axes in bronze from Sk√•ne or Denmark. According to the geologist Barbara Prisemann (Department of Natural history, Rana museum), the axe is made from the green shale rock type.

The Society's meetings were held in Arundel, and members wrote to newspapers and broadcasters, pointing out perceived linguistic errors and instances of ambiguous spoken English. The Society claims to be concerned about the education of children. It believes that teachers should be trained to spot certain errors in English usage. In 1988, the Society delivered a petition to the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, Kenneth Baker, urging him \\"to introduce the compulsory study of formal grammar, including parsing and sentence analysis, into the school curriculum\\". The objectives of the Society, as expressed in its constitution, are \\"to promote the maintenance, knowledge, understanding, development and appreciation of the English language as used both colloquially and in literature; to educate the public in its correct and elegant usage; and to discourage the intrusion of anything detrimental to clarity or euphony‚Äù.

The Federation came into existence in 1984. The Federation has a District Office in each of the maritime districts and one in the Inland district each headed by a District Manager. The District Manager with a team of supporting staff Co- ordinate and supervise all the activities in the district. The administration and management of Matsyafed is vested with a Board of Directors having 19 members of who, 1 are elected from the Primary Co-operatives, 5 official members and 3 non-officials members nominated by the Government. The Chief Executive is the Managing Director.  Activities  Matsyafed is engaged in the implementation of multifaceted activities for the welfare development of the fisherman community as detailed below: *Production oriented activities *Welfare activities *Employment generation activities *Commercial activities *Women oriented activities *Extension activities *Aquaculture activities *Housing and basic sanitation. Production oriented activities: Through the integrated fisheries development project Matsyafed has been involved in the process of supplying quality fishing inputs to the traditional fishermen of marine and inland sectors at subsidized rates. To avoid exploitation of fishermen and to ensure better price to the fish landed, beach level auctions of the fish are conducted by the primary co-operatives societies of Matsyafed. Welfare activities: Eight Vanitha () Buses are operated for transporting fisherman vendors to various routes. The fishermen are covered under the personal accident Insurance scheme for a nominal premium wherein the dependents of those who die in accidents are paid Rs. 1,50 lakhs and for partial disablement Rs. 0.50 lakhs is paid. Community peeling centres are being run in spite of loss to the Federation as an employment opportunity unit for fishermen. Matsyafed has set up 200 small-scale production units of ornamental fishery benefiting 600 fishermen. Employment generation: Matsyafed has been implementing schemes with the assistance of the National Backward classes finance and Development Corporation since 1995-96 and National Minorities development and Finance Corporation since 1997-98 to provide alternate and diversified employment avenues for the unemployed youth. Commercial activities: Matsyafed is spearheading many activities by operating nylon net factories, ice and freezing plant, Diesel bunks, Fish Manure plants, Chitosan Plant, Vyasa stores, OBM service centres etc. To ensure timely service to the fishermen at moderate cost, the OBM workshops are set up. The Net Factory ensures the supply of quality fishing nets at moderate cost; timely supply of fishing inputs and accessories are ensured by the Vyasa Stores. Women-oriented activities: To take up any employment generating activity, fishermen are given loans at very low interest rate. Extension activities: Since it is felt that the backwardness of the fishing folk is mainly due to the lack of general programmes, health awareness camps, medical camps, etc. are being organized in the coastal area. Aquaculture activities: To augment the development of fishery, Matsyafed has been managing 3 farms and 4 hatcheries. To check fishery resource depletion in the marine as well as inland waters, fishery conservation measurements have been taken up. Housing and basic sanitation: Government has entrusted implementation of Housing and sanitation schemes to local bodies from 1997 onwards and hence the residue works are only being carried out. Matsyafed has already completed construction of 33400 houses. In order to give relief to the poor fishermen, Matsyafed had come up with a debt relief scheme amounting to Rs. 9 crores and the government has sanctioned the required amount for this scheme. Based on this, Matsyafed had constructed Adalaths for the Debt relief scheme for fisherman in all the 14 districts and the maximum relief was passed on to the eligible fishermen during this period.

Her husband was Fu Deng (Emperor Gao). Life She was the daughter of the general Mao Xing (ÊØõËàà), who served as the governor of He Province (Ê≤≥Â∑û, modern southwestern Gansu and eastern Qinghai) during the reign of Fu JiƒÅn (Emperor Xuanzhao). After Former Qin began to disintegrate in 384 following the defeat at the Battle of Fei River, the generals in the western empire began to turn on each other, and in 386, Mao Xing was attacked by the generals Wang Guang (ÁéãÂª£) and Wang Tong (ÁéãÁµ±), who were brothers. He defeated Wang Guang, but when he was about to attack Wang Tong, his soldiers, worn out by the wars, assassinated him. After an interim command by Wei Ping (Ë°õÂπ≥), eventually, Fu Deng, a distant relative of Fu JiƒÅn, took over the command of his forces, and was created the Prince of Nan'an by Fu JiƒÅn's son Fu Pi (Emperor Aiping). It might have been at this time that Fu Deng married her, or the marriage might have taken place earlier. After Fu Pi was killed by Jin forces in 386, Fu Deng assumed imperial title. In 387, he created her, who at that time carried the title of Princess of Nan'an, empress. She was described to be beautiful and mighty in battle, capable in horsemanship and archery. In 389, however, when Fu Deng was attacking the Later Qin emperor Yao Chang, Yao Chang made a surprise attack against his base Dajie (Â§ßÁïå, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), where Empress Mao had remained, and she, after making a desperate attempt to fight Yao Chang's forces off with her guards, was captured after killing 700 Later Qin soldiers. Yao Chang wanted to make her his concubine, but she, in anger, cried out: :\\"Yao Chang, you murdered the Son of Heaven (referring to Yao Chang's killing of Fu JiƒÅn in 385), and now you want to humiliate the empress. How can heaven and earth still tolerate you?\\" Yao Chang therefore executed her, along with Fu Deng's sons Fu Bian (ËãªÂºÅ) the Prince of Nan'an and Fu Shang (ËãªÂ∞ö) the Prince of Beihai. (It is unclear whether they were her sons.)  References  * Book of Jin, vol. 115. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 107.

The context of the surrounding verses, Ephesians 2:11-13, implies the uniting of Gentiles with Jews, whom had historically been God's heritage and the object of God's promises. Advocates of Two House theology see in Joseph's blessing over Ephraim and Manasseh evidence that the ten tribes of the Kingdom of Israel became a \\"multitude of nations\\". Commonwealth Theology observes many other Bible verses that predict and affirm that the House of Israel was \\"scattered,\\" swallowed up,\\" \\"not a people.\\" This theology takes the view that the Gentiles (nations) \\"brought near by the blood of Christ\\" may be indistinguishable from the genetic descendants of the Lost Tribes and identical to the \\"believers scattered among the nations\\" (the Church). This connection between the dispersed tribes of Israel and the Gentiles would appear to be substantiated by John 7:35: \\"Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?\\" (KJV) The Commonwealth Theology position that the Commonwealth of Israel denotes more than merely a restored/united Kingdom of Israel is further substantiated by the verses in Ephesians Ch. 2 which follow Paul's reference to the commonwealth. \\"For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. 18 For through Him we both> have access by one Spirit to the Father\\" (Eph. 2:14-18). \\"One new man\\" implies something that did not previously exist, something unique and apart from the United Kingdom under King David and Solomon. In addition, the antecedents of \\"we both\\" refer to the Gentiles who were alienated, strangers, far off, and the recipient of the promises which would include both houses of the Divided Kingdom.

Arping probes hosts on the examined network link by sending Link Layer frames using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request method addressed to a host identified by its MAC address of the network interface.arping Linux manual page The utility program may use ARP to resolve an IP address provided by the user. The function of arping is analogous to the utility ping that probes the network with the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) at the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite. Two popular arping implementations exist. One is part of Linux iputils suite, and cannot resolve MAC addresses to IP addresses. The other arping implementation, written by Thomas Habets, can ping hosts by MAC address as well as by IP address, and adds more features. Having both arping implementations on a system may introduce conflicts. Some Linux distros handle this by removing iputils arping along with dependent packages like NetworkManager if Habets's arping is installed. Others (e.g. Debian-based distros like Ubuntu) have iputils-arping split into a separate package to avoid this problem. In networks employing repeaters that implement proxy ARP, the ARP response may originate from such proxy hosts and not directly from the probed target.

They married on 29 April 1939, and lived at Haddo House, Ellon, Aberdeenshire, home of the Gordon family. They adopted four children who were, until 2004, not entitled to either courtesy titles or for the elder son to inherit the peerage:The issue was discussed by June, Lady Aberdeen, and her elder daughter in a TV series called Aristocrats that was produced in the 1990s. * Lady Mary Katherine Gordon (b. 30 May 1946), married Simon Piers Welfare and had issue. * Lady Sarah Caroline Gordon (b. 25 March 1948), married Mr. P.

However, as a result of a Royal Warrant dated 30 April 2004 adopted children are now automatically entitled to such styles and courtesy titles as their siblings. However, as with illegitimate children where legitimated, such children have no rights to inheritance of peerages, although Scottish peerages rules of descent differ. They founded the Haddo House Choral & Operatic Society in 1945 in order to give additional cultural opportunities to the residents of Aberdeenshire. Haddo House, is surrounded by gardens, park and lake with abundant Scottish wildlife and boasts a wooden built theatre (Haddo House Hall) which was originally built as a tennis court but is now a fully operational theatre and concert hall. The Haddo estate is a uniquely beautiful and peaceful setting for concerts, operas and other shows. Situated 20 miles north of Aberdeen, the House is now administered by the National Trust for Scotland. Known professionally as June Gordon, a graduate of the Royal College of Music, Lady Aberdeen was a pianist and conductor by training and she developed Haddo's musical programme with great enterprise. The first recorded concert was a Christmas Carol service in Haddo House Chapel in 1945, which still occurs annually. Under June‚Äôs baton the society widened its repertoire developing a tradition for presenting major British works ‚Äì both Operas and concerts. She started with directing Handel's 'Messiah' with soloist Elsie Suddaby in 1947 and other highlights have included 1950's Bach's 'St Matthew Passion' with oboist Leon Goosens in a solo role and major choral works by Elgar, Delius, Tippett, Vaughan Williams and Howells and many operas which require chorus. A succession of internationally renowned artists have helped make this North East Scotland venue a lively stage for the very best in choral, operatic and drama productions: Dame Janet Baker was asked to perform there immediately on graduating from the Royal College of Music because Lady Aberdeen thought her \\"promising\\". Glasgow-born Rosalind Sutherland first performed Desdemona in Verdi's opera Otello at Haddo in 1996, and returned as Micaela in Carmen in 1997, before finding fame taking the title role in 'Madame Butterfly' at the San Francisco Opera House. Judith Lovat, now with the Philadelphia Opera, gained early experience at Haddo. Other eminent musicians to appear have included: Benjamin Britten, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Willard White, Sarah Walker, and Neil Mackie. In recent years there have been visiting performers from France, Finland, Denmark, Germany and America. For many years a Summer Play was also produced, using the renowned Globe Stage in the Hall for Shakespeare one year and presenting another playwright's work the next, but this has recently been discontinued. As a young man Prince Edward appeared several times in these productions. Many young people who have grown up in the area have performed at Haddo and gone on to study music and the performing arts at tertiary level. Students from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama take part in the opera every year, gaining invaluable experience in the orchestra, chorus and/or taking small singing roles. The Society is now 65 years old and presents an annual programme of opera, oratorio and carols. Professional pianist and singing teacher Alice E Dennis GTCL trains the chorus. HHCOS prides itself on its high standard of performance, achieved by the local community working alongside the professional artists brought in for producing and designing the opera, for the major solo roles and for playing in the orchestra for the opera and concerts alike. The facilities at Haddo comprise a purpose built rehearsal room, and the theatre known as \\"Haddo House Hall\\" for performances. The Choral Society also uses the tiny and picturesque Chapel, attached to the side of the main House for their popular carol concerts. These venues are a delight for both artists and their audiences. The umbrella organisation at Haddo house; the \\"Haddo User Group\\" involves over 200 members of all ages and backgrounds, who take part in a wide range of productions including the opera, large choral concerts and carol concerts.

It was founded in 1962 and has nine faculties.  History and profile  Plovdiv University, named in honor of the Bulgarian historian Paisii Hilendarski (known as Saint Paisius of Hilendar in English), is the city‚Äôs leading cultural and scientific institution. It is the largest institution of higher education in southern Bulgaria and the third largest Bulgarian university, after St. Kliment Ohridski University of Sofia and St. Cyril and St. Methodius University of Veliko Tarnovo. In 1945 the University of Plovdiv was inaugurated by a Decree of the Regents‚Äô Council of August the 4th, promulgated the same year in the State Gazette of August 20, structured in two faculties: Medicine and Agriculture and Forestry,General information about the Agricultural university Plovdiv which in July 1961 was reorganized as Higher Teacher-Training Institute of Natural and Mathematical Sciences. The institute was promoted to university status by government decree on 12 January 1972, when it took its present name ‚ÄúPaisiy Hilendarski‚Äù Plovdiv University. In 1973, it became the first higher institution in Plovdiv to offer language and literature studies, offering B.A. degrees in Bulgarian and Russian Languages and Literature. Soon after, a program in Slavonic Languages and Literature (with specialization in Czech Language and Literature) was added. A degree in Education was offered for the first time in 1984, Law degree programs were introduced in 1992, and Economics degree programs were launched in 1994. Today the University of Plovdiv is a true university by international standards, since it provides training to students in the four major fields of higher education: natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, and economics. ‚ÄúPaisiy Hilendarski‚Äù Plovdiv University has been institutionally accredited by National Certification and Accreditation Board (Protocol No. 1 of 15 February 2001). Over 7,500 full-time and 5,000 part-time students are enrolled in the programs and courses by the university‚Äôs nine faculties. The full-time teaching staff consists of 34 full professors, 167 associate professors and 360 assistant professors. The university also comprises a Technical College in Smolyan as well as two branches outside of Plovdiv: a Smolyan branch, successor to the Teacher Training Institute opened in 1962 as part of the old Bulgarian tradition in teacher training, and a branch in Kardzhali, successor of semi-Pedagogical Institute \\"L.Karavelov\\" - Kardzhali founded in 1961.

It was notable for being Korg's first largely \\"knobless\\" synthesizer - featuring a push-button interface for programming, dispensing with the Polysix's knobs and switches. The Poly-61 also uses digitally controlled analog oscillators or DCO's (Roland's Juno-6 had made the same leap the previous year), in place of the Polysix' VCOs. The Poly-61 also boasted double the amount of patch memory (64 memory positions versus the Polysix's 32), but did not feature its predecessor's on board effects. In 1984 a MIDI version, the Poly-61M was released featuring basic MIDI implementation, however, prior to that, a person could order a factory installed Poly 61 with MIDI in and MIDI out jacks installed on a plate on the rear of the keyboard, simply called Poly-61 with Factory Installed MIDI. The MIDI implementation was basic with only note on and note off information, partly as the synthesiser was not touch sensitive. Audio path =Oscillators= The Poly-61 offers two DCOs per voice. DCO1, a more traditional design, provides sawtooth, pulse, and PWM waveforms. DCO2, based on low-resolution counter ICs, has only sawtooth and square, and is not available on its own. =Filter= The filter has the typical controls for cutoff, resonance, keyboard tracking and envelope amount. Some of these are rather limited by the parameter resolution. Keyboard tracking is simply \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" for example, and resonance and envelope level (here labelled \\"EG Intensity\\") have only 8 values. However, when manipulated by internal LFOs, the resolution is considerably better without notable stepping. =Output= The final component in the audio path is a VCA. It can be driven by the envelope generator or a CV/Gate pulse. =Embedded processors= NEC D8049C - 8 bits, 11 MHz (max.), 40 pins (DIP), Supply Voltage = 5V There are 2 of them on the CPU board (KLM-509), one is a Programmer and the other is an Assigner. The 8049 has 2 kB of masked ROM as well as 128 bytes of RAM and 27 I/O ports. The ¬µC's oscillator block divides the incoming clock into 15 internal phases, thus with its 11 MHz max. crystal, one gets 0.73 MIPS (of one-clock instructions). Some 70% of instructions are single byte/cycle, but 30% need two cycles and/or two bytes, so raw performance is closer to 0.5 MIPS. The minimum instruction length is 8 bits and the maximum instruction length is 16 bits. Modulation =Envelope generator= The envelope is an ADSR type. All parameters can only be set to one of 16 values. There are 6 SSM-2056 analog envelope generator chips used in the Poly 61, each being controlled by discrete 4-bit D/A converters. This means there are only 16 possible settings for each of the ADSR parameters. =LFO= The LFO (known as a 'modulation generator' on the Poly-61) is a simple triangle wave that can be routed to the DCOs or VCF. It has a variable delay before it is triggered. =Joystick= The joystick controls a second LFO, adjustable by a knob with rate indicator LED, and entirely independent of the main LFO, although the effect can be cumulative. The joystick can be used to route this to DCO pitch (vibrato) or VCF. As control of this LFO is entirely manual, it does not feature in the programmable patch structure of the synth. Performance features =Joystick= Unlike the separate pitch and modulation wheels of the Polysix, the Poly 61 features a full joystick, with variable pitchbend (+/- about 7 semitones), and an independent LFO (see above). =Chord memory= As well as standard 6-voice polyphony, a chord memory can be engaged, memorising any chord voicing held down while pressing the Chord Memory button. This chord is then replicated, its lowest note matching any note played on the keyboard. A hold function works in either Poly or Chord mode, with a dedicated input jack for a release foot pedal. =Arpeggiator= There is a simple arpeggiator with dedicated control buttons and tempo knob, which can work in conjunction with the chord memory for moderately sophisticated sequences.

He was responsible for sweeping military reforms that changed the face of the Russian army in the 1860s and 1870s. Further, he was instrumental in creating the framework for the genocide of Circassian Refugees from 1861 to 1865.  Early career  Milyutin graduated from the Moscow University School in 1833 and Nicholas Military Academy in 1836. Unlike his brother Nikolai Milyutin, who chose to pursue a career in civil administration, Dmitry volunteered to take part in the Caucasian War (1839‚Äì45). After sustaining a grave wound, he returned to the military academy to deliver lectures as a professor. In the following years, Milyutin earned a considerable reputation as a brilliant scholar. He emphasized the scientific value of military statistics and authored the first comprehensive study of the subject, which earned him the Demidov Prize for 1847. Milyutin regarded Suvorov as a model for military commanders and the Italian campaign of 1799 as the pinnacle of his career, elaborating these views in a detailed account of the campaign, published in five volumes in 1852 and 1853. Capitalizing on his knowledge, Milyutin analyzed the causes of Russia's defeat in the Crimean War and framed some radical proposals for military reforms. His ideas were approved by Alexander II, who appointed Milyutin to the post of Minister of War in 1861. Several years earlier, Milyutin had taken part in the capture of Shamil, thus helping bring the prolonged Caucasian War to an end.  Minister of War  Milyutin was Minister of War from 16 May 1861 to 21 May 1881. The military reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure resulted in the levy system being introduced to Russia and military districts being created across the country. Military service was declared compulsory to all males aged 21 for 6 years instead of the previous 25 years. This applied to all males including nobles. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army such as it continued into the 21st century until Anatoliy Serdyukov announced military reforms to end in 2020. (See: 2008 Russian military reform) Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874 Russian Army had no constant barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks.Wies≈Çaw Caban, Losy ≈ºo≈Çnierzy powstania listopadowego wcielonych do armii carskiej, w: PrzeglƒÖd Historyczny, t. XCI, z. 2, s. 245. The success of his reforms was demonstrated during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). Milyutin's subtle leadership made itself felt during the peak of the conflict when the Russians failed three times in a row to take Pleven and many experts advised them to retreat. Milyutin promptly ordered the siege to be continued in a more orderly manner which brought the war to a victorious end. At the close of the war, Milyutin set up a commission in order to investigate faulty supply of provisions and other problems that had surfaced during the siege. In recognition of his services, he was made a count and received all the Russian orders, including the Order of Saint Andrew. Having gained the tsar's ear, Milyutin was the chief decision-maker, for ordering the deportations that he knew would Cause the death from starvation and disease of large numbers of Circassians from 1861 to 1865.Walter Richmond, The Circassian Genocide (Rutgers University Press, 2013) pp 70-71, 131-32.  Later life  General Dmitry Milyutin After the Congress of Berlin, Milyutin succeeded the ailing Chancellor Gorchakov as the leader of the imperial foreign policy. Alexander II's assassination in 1881 rendered his position precarious, however, and after Konstantin Pobedonostsev, intent on reversing the liberal innovations of the previous reign, emerged as the most powerful policy-maker, Milyutin resigned his office. In 1898, when the 80th anniversary of Alexander II was celebrated, he was promoted to Field Marshal, the first man to receive this honour for many years and the last in the history of the Russian Empire. He died in Simeiz in 1912.

He was born in Gottorf Castle as the elder son of Duke Christian Albert of Holstein-Gottorp and Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark. He was married on 12 May 1698 to Princess Hedwig Sophia of Sweden and they had an only child, Charles Frederick, who eventually fathered the future Tsar Peter III of Russia, therefore making Frederick a patrilineal ancestor to all Russian emperors after Catherine II. He took part in the Great Northern War and was killed by artillery fire in the Battle of Klisz√≥w in Poland. According to Robert Massie's Peter the Great: His Life and World, Duke Frederick arrived in Stockholm to marry his cousin, Princess Hedwig Sophia, soon befriending his first cousin and new brother-in-law, King Charles XII (their respective mothers, Frederica Amalia and Ulrika Eleonora, being daughters of Frederick III of Denmark). His visit made such an impression on Swedish society that the excesses surrounding him and the King earned him \\"the Gottorp Fury\\" as a nickname. Duke Frederick and King Charles regularly participated in wild festivities, drinking binges, and outlandish pranks. Generally, Duke Frederick's influence was the blame for the King's \\"reckless\\" lifestyle. There were even rumors at the time that the Duke sought to kill the King and usurp the throne. As it happened, according to Massie in the aforementioned book, the 17-year-old King Charles, in the summer of 1699, pushed himself to an unbearable point of excess and vowed never to touch another drop of liquor again. Apparently, writes Massie, the King stuck to beer thereafter, and even just drank beer when he was either wounded or post-battle. As for his relationship with his cousin Frederick, they remained on good terms, so much that King Charles gave him military assistance to defend Holstein-Gottorp from Danish invasion.

Early life He was the son of George Talbot Rice, 3rd Baron Dynevor. Dynevor matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford 13 October 1812; he was awarded a D.C.L. on 11 June 1834. By royal licence, 28 October 1824, he took the name of Trevor, after that of Rice, on inheriting the estates of the Trevor family at Glynde, Sussex. Political career He served as Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Carmarthenshire, from 1820 to 1831. At the 1831 General Election he chose to stand down from the Commons on the basis that his political views diverged from those of his constituents. The following years, however, he contested the seat and was re-elected, serving until his elevation to the peerage in 1852 upon the death of his father. Rebecca Riots When the Rebecca Riots of 1843‚Äì44 reached Carmarthenshire Rice-Trevor, as a militia officer, and MP and vice-lieutenant of the county, returned from London to deal with the situation. After the rioters burned crops on his father's Dinefwr estate he threatened armed retaliation. The response of the rioters was to dig a grave in the grounds and announce that Rice-Trevor would occupy it by 10 October 1843. He did not, but he did order in so many troops and police that a barracks had to be built to accommodate them. Later life Lord Dynevor succeeded to the title of Baron Dynevor and the Dinefwr estate on the death of his father in 1852. He was an honorary colonel in the militia and from 1852 to 1869 he served as ADC to Queen Victoria. Personal life On 27 November 1824 he married Frances Fitzroy, daughter of General Lord Charles Fitzroy (a younger son of Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton). The couple had the following children: *The Hon. Frances Emily Rice (1827- 26 November 1863) *The Hon.

Head smooth and black; body of a uniform dark madder brown, prettily lighted with a tinge of pink at the points of some of the fleshy processes; dorsal process on the 8th segment and a lateral pair on the 7th pinkish-white, with a band of the same colour uniting them. * Pupa. Suspended by the tail and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown back. Head somewhat angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p. 9) states- \\"The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought at first it was merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more like the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour.\\" Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it \\"as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings.\\" Range Western Ghats and parts of the Eastern Ghats. Status The butterfly is locally very common in the southern and central Western Ghats covering the states of Karnataka and Kerala. Also found in southern Maharashtra and northern Goa where it is uncommon. Despite its restricted range and endemicity, the butterfly is not known to be threatened but the IUCN recommends continuous monitoring. Habitat Found up to in the Western Ghats. Found in diverse habitats from low-land evergreen forests near the coast to mixed deciduous forests, dry scrub and agricultural fields. Habits Active during early morning hours when both sexes feed in the forest on Lantana and diverse food plants. Later on, it is seen sailing as high as over the countryside until it descends later in the evening to feed again. It flies in a leisurely manner circling around jungle clearings and also frequents hill tops. A determined flier, it is known to cover very large distances before settling. The only food source is nectar, it also visits gardens and orchards and sips from domestic plants such as Mussaenda, Ixora and Lantana. Life cycle Though it flies all the year round, it is abundant in the during monsoon and post-monsoon periods. =Eggs= Spherical eggs laid singly on the edges of the undersides of young leaves and shoots. =Larva= Velvety maroon red with shiny black head and four rows of fleshy bright red tubercles. Grey markings on the back with a broad oblique pink white band on the 7th and 8th segments. These are heavily parasitised by tiny braconid wasps. =Pupa= Pale brown or green, marked with fine brown striations and minute markings. Found on the underside of leaves. If touched, it sways and makes hissing sounds.

It was part of the Damascus eyalet (province) until, as a result of widespread administrative reform in the mid 1800s, it became an independent sanjak (district) in 1872. Since the 1860s, Jews have formed the largest religious group in the city and since around 1887, with the beginning of expansion outside the old city walls, Jews have been in the majority.Ruth Kark and Michal Oren-Nordheim (2001). and Its Environs: Quarters, Neighborhoods, Villages, 1800‚Äì1948. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 28. In the 19th century, European powers vied for influence in the city usually on the basis of extending protection over Christian churches and Holy Places. Much of the property that is now owned by the churches was bought during this time. A number of these countries also established consulates in Jerusalem. After capturing Jerusalem in 1917, Great Britain was in control of Jerusalem; initially under a wartime administration, it was part of the Mandate of Palestine assigned to the Britain in 1920. The principal Allied Powers recognized the unique spiritual and religious interests in Jerusalem among the world's three great monotheistic religions as \\"a sacred trust of civilization\\",Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 2004, p. 165 para. 70.Paul J. I. M. de Waart (2005). \\"International Court of Justice Firmly Walled in the Law of Power in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace Process\\". Leiden Journal of International Law. 18 (3): pp. 467‚Äì487. \\"The Court ascertained the legal significance of the 'sacred trust of civilization' of the League of Nations (LoN) in respect of the 1922 Palestine Mandate as the origin of the present responsibility of the United Nations\\". and stipulated that the existing rights and claims connected with it be safeguarded in perpetuity, under international guarantee.See, for example, Article 28 of the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine. However, the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine were in mortal dispute and Britain sought United Nations assistance in resolving the dispute. In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine (Resolution 181), which called for the partition of Palestine into a separate Arab and Jewish state, with Jerusalem (with borders expanded to include Bethlehem) being established as a corpus separatum, or a \\"separated body\\", with a special legal and political status, administered by the United Nations.General Assembly resolution 48/158D, 20 December 1993. para. 5(c) stipulated that the permanent status negotiations should guarantee \\"arrangements for peace and security of all States in the region, including those named in resolution 181(II) of 29 November 1947\\" The Free City of Danzig was a historical precedent for this solution; Trieste was a contemporaneous city ruled by the UN. Jewish representatives accepted the partition plan, while representatives of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states rejected it, declaring it illegal. On May 14, 1948, the Jewish community in Palestine issued the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel. Israel became a member of the United Nations the following year and has since been recognised by most countries.United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273. The countries recognizing Israel did not recognize its sovereignty over Jerusalem generally, citing the UN resolutions which called for an international status for the city. The United States and Guatemala have embassies in Jerusalem. With the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel and the subsequent invasion by surrounding Arab states, the UN proposal for Jerusalem never materialised. The 1949 Armistice Agreements left Jordan in control of the eastern parts of Jerusalem, while the western sector (with the exception of the Mount Scopus exclave in the east) was held by Israel. Each side recognised the other's de facto control of their respective sectors. The Armistice Agreement, however, was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of the provisions of the partition resolution for the internationalisation of Jerusalem.See: * \\"Corpus Separatum ¬ß33 Jerusalem\\" Marjorie M.

In 1950, Jordan annexed East Jerusalem as part of its larger annexation of the West Bank. Though the United Kingdom and Iraq recognized Jordanian rule over East Jerusalem, no other country recognized either Jordanian or Israeli rule over the respective areas of the city under their control. Pakistan is sometimes falsely claimed to have recognized the annexation as well. Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel declared that Israeli law would be applied to East Jerusalem and enlarged its eastern boundaries, approximately doubling its size. The action was deemed unlawful by other states who did not recognize it. It was condemned by the UN Security Council and General Assembly which described it as an annexation and a violation of the rights of the Palestinian population. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law, which declared that \\"Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel\\".\\"Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel (Unofficial translation)\\". www.knesset.gov.il. Passed by the Knesset on the 17th Av, 5740 (30 July 1980). The Security Council declared the law null and void in Resolution 478, which also called upon member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from the city. The UN General Assembly has also passed numerous resolutions to the same effect.\\"A/RES/66/18 of 26 January 2012\\". United Nations General Assembly. Archived from the original on 3 February 2014. Prelude: UN resolution from 1947 map of UN Jerusalem On 29 November 1947 the UN General Assembly passed a resolution which, as part of its Partition Plan for Palestine, included the establishment of Jerusalem as a separate international entity under the auspices of the United Nations, a so- called corpus separatum. Israel Israel's parliament =1948 war and 1949 diplomatic steps= During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Israel took control of West Jerusalem while Jordan took control of East Jerusalem (including the walled Old City in which most holy places are located). Although accepting partition before the war, Israel rejected the UN's corpus separatum decision at the Lausanne Conference of 1949, and instead indicated a preference for division of Jerusalem into Jewish and Arab zones, and international control and protection only for holy places and sites. Letter dated 31 May 1949, addressed by Mr. Walter Eytan, Head of the Delegation of Israel (doc.nr. A/AC.25/Com.Jer/9 d.d. 1 June 1949)FRUS, 1949. Foreign Relations of the United States, 1949, Section Israel. United States Department of State, Telegram from US consul to Secretary of State. FRUS, 1949, pp. 661‚Äì663, 13 January 1949 Also in 1949, as the UN General Assembly began debating the implementation of its corpus separatum decision, Israel declared Jerusalem as Israel's \\"eternal capital\\". =Aftermath of 1967 Six-Day War= After Israel conquered East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israel argued that it had the stronger right to the city. Very soon after its conquest of East Jerusalem in 1967, Israel merged East Jerusalem with West Jerusalem by administratively extending the municipal boundary of the city. =1980 Jerusalem Law= In July 1980, the Knesset passed the Jerusalem Law as part of the country's Basic Law, which declared Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel. =Legal positions since Oslo Accords= On the 'corpus separatum' issue According to a 1999 statement by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \\"There is no basis in international law for the position supporting a status of 'corpus separatum' (separate entity) for the city of Jerusalem.\\"The Status of Jerusalem. Archived from the original on 4 May 2016. Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 14 March 1999. Quote comes from ¬ßIV. In the view of the ministry, the concept of corpus separatum became irrelevant after the Arab states rejected the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and invaded the newly created State of Israel in 1948. Accordingly, the ministry states, \\"There has never been any agreement, treaty, or international understanding which applies the 'Corpus Separatum' concept to Jerusalem.\\" On sovereignty In 2003 Israel argued that Jordan had no rights to any land west of the Jordan River, that it had taken the West Bank and East Jerusalem by an act of aggression, and therefore never acquired sovereignty. =Government positions since Oslo Accords= Positions on the final status of Jerusalem have varied with different Israeli governments.  Yitzhak Rabin (Prime Minister 1992‚Äì95)  The Oslo Accords declared that the final status of Jerusalem would be negotiated, but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared that he would never divide the city. In 1995, he told a group of school children that \\"if they told us peace is the price of giving up a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, my reply would be 'let's do without peace'\\". Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister 1996‚Äì99) This position was upheld by his successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated there would be ‚Äú..no discussion of the case of Jerusalem...‚Äù.Hawas, Akram T. The new alliance: Turkey and Israel . The fourth Nordic conference on Middle Eastern Studies: The Middle East in globalizing world. Oslo, 13‚Äì16 August 1998.  Ehud Barak (Prime Minister 1999‚Äì2001)  Netanyahu's successor, Ehud Barak, during negotiations, became the first Israeli Prime Minister to allow for a possible division of Jerusalem, despite his campaign promises.  Ariel Sharon (Prime Minister 2001‚Äì06)  Prime minister during the second intifada, Ariel Sharon was unequivocal in his support for an undivided Jerusalem. In an interview done one week before a stroke incapacitated him he stated: ‚ÄúOur position is that Jerusalem is not negotiable. We are not going to negotiate on Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be forever a united and undivided capital of Israel.‚Äù  Ehud Olmert (Prime Minister 2006‚Äì09)  Prime Minister (and former Jerusalem mayor) Ehud Olmert vowed to keep Jerusalem the \\"undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people\\", but later supported the detachment of several Arab neighborhoods from Israeli sovereignty and the introduction of an international trust to run the Temple Mount.  Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister 2009‚Äìcurrent)  When Netanyahu succeeded Olmert, he declared that \\"all of Jerusalem would always remain under Israeli sovereignty\\" and that only Israel would \\"ensure the freedom of religion and freedom of access for the three religions to the holy places\\". \\"Netanyahu: Jerusalem holy sites will remain Israeli forever\\". Haaretz. 21 May 2009. These statements seem to closely reflect Israeli public opinion. According to a 2012 poll by the right- wing Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 78% of Jewish voters who responded said that they would reconsider voting for any politician that wants to relinquish Israel's control over the Old City and East Jerusalem. On 17 May 2015, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated, regarding Jerusalem serving as the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state, \\"Jerusalem has forever been the capital of only the Jewish people and no other nation.\\" On 2 January 2018 Israel passed into law new legislation that requires the two-thirds majority support of the Knesset for any section of Jerusalem to be transferred to a foreign government. On 25 January 2018, Netanyahu repeated the previous government position but seemed to alter it, reportedly saying: \\"Under any peace agreement the capital of Israel will continue to be in Jerusalem.\\" (stress added)Jerusalem Post, 25 January 2018: Netanyahu at Davos: Jerusalem to remain capital under any peace agreement Palestine During the British Mandate, the main representation of the Palestinian Arabs was the Arab Higher Committee, formed in the beginning of the Great Arab revolt in 1936; it was outlawed in 1937 and its leaders deported. Reconstituted in 1945 and dominated by Palestinian Arabs, it continued in various iterations until 1948, when, viewed as a threat to Jordan, its army was forced to disband. There was unequivocal support for an Arab controlled Jerusalem (at that time the status quo). Until the establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964, there was little in terms of an internationally recognised representation of the Palestinian Arabs. The Arab League usually took over the job, with the short-lived Egyptian-controlled All-Palestine Government based in Gaza having little sway, and Jordan taking control of the West Bank with East Jerusalem. Until the Oslo Accords in 1993, and the Letters of Mutual Recognition, the Palestinians, represented since 1964 by the PLO, had at all times rejected any partition of any part of the former British Mandate territory. However, while they had previously rejected the UN's internationalisation plan, most of the Arab delegations at the Lausanne Conference of 1949 accepted a permanent international regime (called corpus separatum) under United Nations supervision as proposed in Resolutions 181 and 194.UN Committee on Jerusalem, Meeting between the Committee on Jerusalem and the delegations of the Arab states, 20 June 1949 (doc.nr. A/AC.25/Com.Jer./SR.33) The Arabs vociferously objected to Israel moving to (West) Jerusalem its national institutions, namely the Knesset, the presidential, legislative, judicial and administrative offices. The Palestinian leadership now claims the \\"1967 borders\\" (in effect the 1949 armistice lines) as the borders of the Palestinian territories, and includes East Jerusalem as part of these territories. Despite recognition of Israel (only from Fatah, not Hamas), and its support in 1949 of corpus separatum, it had never conceded sovereignty of Jerusalem. In 1988, Jordan conceded all claims to the West Bank, including Jerusalem, other than the Muslim holy places on the Temple Mount, and recognized the PLO as the legal representatives of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian territory, in line with UNSC Resolution 242. The PNA claims all of East Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount, as the capital of the State of Palestine, and claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to final status negotiations, but is willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city. In the Palestine Liberation Organization's Palestinian Declaration of Independence of 1988, Jerusalem is called the capital of the State of Palestine. In 2000 the Palestinian Authority passed a law designating the city as such, and in 2002 this law was ratified by Chairman Yasser Arafat.\\"Arafat Signs Law Making Jerusalem Palestinian Capital\\", People's Daily, published 6 October 2002; \\"Arafat names Jerusalem as capital\\", BBC News, published 6 October 2002. The official position of the PNA is that Jerusalem should be an open city, with no physical partition and that Palestine would guarantee freedom of worship, access and the protection of sites of religious significance. The status quo on the Temple Mount now is that tourists are allowed to visit, but not pray, on the Temple Mount, although this seems to be slowly changing. United Nations The United Nations considers East Jerusalem to be part of Israeli- occupied territories or occupied Palestinian territory. It envisions Jerusalem eventually becoming the capital of two states, Israel and Palestine.\\"Jerusalem must be capital of both Israel and Palestine, Ban says\\". 28 October 2009. UN News Centre. This is at odds with other General Assembly Resolutions, which promote an internationally administered Jerusalem. United Nations General Assembly resolution 181 (II), passed on 29 November 1947, provided for the full territorial internationalisation of Jerusalem: \\"The City of Jerusalem shall be established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime and shall be administered by the United Nations.\\" The resolution received the consent of the Jewish leadership in Palestine, but it was rejected by the Arabs. This position was restated in the wake of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War in UN General Assembly Resolution 303(IV) of 1949. According to a 1979 report prepared for and under the guidance of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, it would appear that the United Nations has maintained the principle that the legal status of Jerusalem is that of a corpus separatum.\\"The Status of Jerusalem, CEIRPP, DPR (1 January 1981)\\". Section \\"Conclusions\\". The United Nations General Assembly does not recognize Israel's proclamation of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which is, for example, reflected in the wording of General Assembly Resolution 63/30 of 2009 which states that \\"any actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity whatsoever, and calls upon Israel to cease all such illegal and unilateral measures.\\" Although the General Assembly cannot pass legally binding resolutions over international issues, the United Nations Security Council, which has the authority to do so, has passed a total of six Security Council resolutions on Israel on the matter, including UNSC resolution 478 which affirmed that the enactment of the 1980 Basic Jerusalem Law declaring unified Jerusalem as Israel's \\"eternal and indivisible\\" capital, was a violation of international law. The resolution advised member states to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city. The Security Council, as well as the UN in general, has consistently affirmed the position that East Jerusalem (but not west Jerusalem) is occupied Palestinian territory subject to the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the \\"Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\\" described East Jerusalem as \\"occupied Palestinian territory\\". Many UN member states formally adhere to the UN proposal that Jerusalem should have an international status, as outlined in General Assembly Resolution 181 (II).Ira Sharkansky. Governing Jerusalem: Again on the World's Agenda. Wayne State University Press, 1996, page 23. . The European Union has also followed the UN's lead in this regard, declaring Jerusalem's status to be that of a corpus separatum, or an international city to be administered by the UN. On the other hand, and inconsistent with the status of corpus separatum, the UN has designated East Jerusalem occupied Palestinian territory. China recognizes East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. The UN has never revoked resolutions 181 and 194, and maintains the official position that Jerusalem should be placed under a special international regime.UNGA, 30 November 2011, Resolution adopted by the General Assembly, 66/18.

Quoting a statement by the European Union: \\"If there is to be genuine peace, a way must be found to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states.\\" The EU opposes measures which would prejudge the outcome of permanent status negotiations on Jerusalem, basing its policy on the principles set out in UN Security Council Resolution 242, notably the impossibility of acquisition of territory by force.

The states that have maintained consulates in Jerusalem say that it was part of Mandate Palestine, and in a de jure sense has not since become part of any other sovereignty. The Netherlands maintains an office in Jerusalem serving mainly Israeli citizens. Other foreign governments base consulate general offices in Jerusalem, including Greece, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Since the President of Israel resides in Jerusalem and confirms the foreign diplomats, the ambassadors have to travel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to submit letters of credentials upon being appointed. =Russia= On 6 April 2017 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying, \\"We reaffirm our commitment to the UN-approved principles for a Palestinian-Israeli settlement, which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. At the same time, we must state that in this context we view West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\\" Some commentators interpreted this as a Russian recognition of Israel's claim to West Jerusalem, while others understood the statement as a Russian intention to recognize West Jerusalem as Israel's in the context of a peace deal with the Palestinians.\\"Russia could acknowledge West Jerusalem as Israeli Capital\\". Palestine News Network. 8 April 2017. \\"[T]he Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that if a peace agreement between Israeli and Palestinian people could be reached, Russia could acknowledge West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.\\"\\"Russia will recognize W Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital only if E Jerusalem becomes Palestine‚Äôs ‚Äì FM\\". RT. 6 April 2017. \\"In a diplomatic missive endorsing the two-state solution, Moscow has said that it is ready to recognize West Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs official capital, providing that statehood is granted to Palestinians, who will base their capital in the eastern part of the city.\\"\\"Russia Says It Would Recognize West Jerusalem as Israeli Capital in Deal With Palestinians\\". Haaretz. 8 April 2017. \\"In an unusual move, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Thursday in which it said, for the first time, that in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, West Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel.\\" On 14 June 2018, Russia held, for the first time, its annual Russia Day reception in Jerusalem. Until then, the annual reception has been held in the Tel Aviv area. Although Russia has publicly recognised West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, it continues to locate its embassy in Tel Aviv. Prior to these events, in 2011 the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that Russia had recognized the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital already in 1988, and that it had not changed its view.Medvedev reaffirms Soviet recognition of Palestine (Ynet News, 18 January 2011) \\"Russian president says Moscow has not changed its position since 1988 when it 'recognized independent Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem'\\" Russia has publicly opposed Israeli settlement construction in East Jerusalem. In March 2010, the Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Israeli plans to construct homes for Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem, calling the measure \\"unacceptable\\" and in opposition to \\"internationally acknowledged reconciliation proceedings\\". In January 2011, reaffirming Russia's recognition of the State of Palestine, President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia \\"supported and will support the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to an independent state with its capital in East Jerusalem.\\" =United States= Greater Jerusalem, May 2006. CIA remote sensing map showing what they regard as settlements, plus refugee camps, fences, walls, etc. The United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and maintains its embassy there. Prior to the embassy's opening in Jerusalem on 14 May 2018, the United States maintained its embassy in Tel Aviv, and a consulate general in Jerusalem as part of the \\"Consular Corps of the Corpus Separatum\\".See Whiteman, \\"Corpus Separatum\\" When Israel was founded, the position of the United States was that its recognition of Israel did not imply a particular view on the status of Jerusalem. The US voted for the UN Partition Plan in November 1947, which provided for the establishment of an international regime for the city, and Resolution 194 in 1948, following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. But the US voted against Resolution 303 in 1949 which reaffirmed that Jerusalem be established a corpus separatum under a special international regime to be administered by the UN, because the US regarded the plan as no longer feasible after both Israel and Jordan had established a political presence in the city. Since then the US position has been that final status of Jerusalem be resolved through negotiations. The US Consulate was given a lot in the neighborhood of Talpiot in 1989 with a 99-year lease agreement with the Israeli government and relocated there in 2002.\\"Diplomatic construction\\", Jerusalem Post, published 1 December 2005. On 14 May 2018, the US reclassified its Jerusalem consulate as the US embassy in Jerusalem. =China= China recognizes East Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine.China supports Palestinian UN bid (Xinhua, 8 September 2011) \\"China recognizes Palestine as a country with east Jerusalem as its capital and possessing full sovereignty and independence, in accordance with borders agreed upon in 1967, according to Jiang\\" In a 2016 speech to the Arab League, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said that \\"China firmly supports the Middle East peace process and supports the establishment of a State of Palestine enjoying full sovereignty on the basis of the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital.\\" China announced that this position remains unchanged in the aftermath of the US recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom position on Jerusalem states that \\"Jerusalem was supposed to be a ‚Äòcorpus separatum‚Äô, or international city administered by the UN. But this was never set up: immediately after the UNGA resolution partitioning Palestine, Israel occupied West Jerusalem and Jordan occupied East Jerusalem (including the Old City). We recognised the de facto control of Israel and Jordan, but not sovereignty. In 1967, Israel occupied E Jerusalem, which we continue to consider is under illegal military occupation by Israel. Our Embassy to Israel is in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem. In E Jerusalem we have a Consulate-General, with a Consul-General who is not accredited to any state: this is an expression of our view that no state has sovereignty over Jerusalem.\\" The UK believes that the city's status has yet to be determined, and maintains that it should be settled in an overall agreement between the parties concerned, but considers that the city should not again be divided. The Declaration of Principles and the Interim Agreement, signed by Israel and the PLO on 13 September 1993 and 28 September 1995 respectively, left the issue of the status of Jerusalem to be decided in the ‚Äòpermanent status‚Äô negotiations between the two parties. In 2012, the UK Press Complaints Commission initially ruled that the newspaper The Guardian had not acted wrongly in writing that \\"Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel; Tel Aviv is,\\" but this was later overturned. In the latter ruling, the UK Press Complaints Commission ruled that The Guardian was wrong to refer to the Israeli capital unequivocally as Tel Aviv, saying that this \\"had the potential to mislead readers and raised a breach of... the Editors‚Äô Code of Practice.\\" In addition, prior to the latter ruling, The Guardian retracted their statement, saying, \\"While it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear Israel's designation of Jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community, we accept that it is wrong to state that Tel Aviv ‚Äì the country's financial and diplomatic centre ‚Äì is the capital\\". =France= The French Government notes that \\"It is up to the parties to come to a final and overall agreement with regard to the final status, which would put an end to the conflict.

The Guardian. Retrieved 10 December 2017. downplays Jewish connection to the Temple Mount. * : The Vatican has had a long-held position on Jerusalem and its concern for the protection of the Christian holy places in the Holy Land which predates the Palestinian Mandate. The Vatican's historic claims and interests, as well as those of Italy and France were based on the former Protectorate of the Holy See and the French Protectorate of Jerusalem, which were incorporated in article 95 of the Treaty of S√®vres (1920), which incorporated the Balfour Declaration, but also provided: \\"it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine\\". The Balfour Declaration and the proviso were also incorporated in the Palestinian Mandate (1923), but which also provided in articles 13 and 14 for an international commission to resolve competing claims on the holy places. These claimants had officially lost all capitulation rights by article 28 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). However, Britain never gave any effect to Mandate provisions arts 13 & 14\\\\. During the drafting of proposals that culminated in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine (also known as Resolution 181) in 1947, the historic claims of the Vatican, Italy and France were revived, and expressed as the call for the special international regime for the city of Jerusalem. This was also confirmed in UN General Assembly Resolution 194 in 1948, which maintained the position that Jerusalem be made an international city, under United Nations supervision. The Vatican's official position on the status of Jerusalem was in favour of an internationalization of Jerusalem, in order to keep the holy place away from either Israeli or Arab sovereignty. Pope Pius XII supported this idea in the 1949 encyclical Redemptoris nostri cruciatus. It was proposed again during the papacies of John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. The Vatican reiterated this position in 2012, recognizing Jerusalem's \\"identity and sacred character\\" and calling for freedom of access to the city's holy places to be protected by \\"an internationally guaranteed special statute\\". After the US recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017, Pope Francis repeated the Vatican's position: \\"I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\\" * : In 2018, Venezuelan government affirmed the support for Palestinian cause by declaring its stance to recognize Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Palestine after the US embassy move to Jerusalem which is called as an \\"extremist decision\\" that lacks legal validity and violates international law.

It was later merged with the General Land Office to form the Bureau of Land Management.  History  When the Taylor Grazing Act was passed in 1934 by the United States Congress, an office under the Department of the Interior was also created to manage the act. It was first called the Division of Grazing, but later was renamed the U.S. Grazing Service in 1939.https://www.blm.gov/about/history/timeline Its responsibilities were to enforce the act, which leased public lands to farmers and ranchers for grazing. The Grazing Service encountered multiple problems, such as very low fees to lease land, which could not be raised due to opposition from farmers, budget reductions enacted by Congress, or unlawful use of the lands. Hoping to better control improper use of the lands, the Grazing Service moved its headquarters from Washington, D.C. to Salt Lake City, Utah. With so much conflict surrounding the Grazing Service, the Secretary of the Interior combined the Grazing Service and the General Land Office to form the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in 1946. The BLM was given the responsibilities of the former U.S. Grazing Service and General Land Office. The BLM retained control of its laws until 1976. In that year, Congress passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). The FLPMA removed the responsibilities of the former General Land Office. It also changed fees and some regulations in the BLM's other set of responsibilities, which had been owned by the Grazing Service, and that are still used today. The late Wyoming State Representative George R. Salisbury, Jr., of Carbon County worked for the Grazing Service prior to World War II.

Originally published in 1999 (with a minor update in 2001), a revised and updated Second Edition was issued on 2013, reflecting the new changes in the Joyo Kanji mandated in 2010. This Revised and Expanded Edition increases the number of kanji entries from 2,230 to 3,002, as well as changing all pronunciations from romaji to kana. There also exists electronic forms of this dictionary for both iOS and Android. A more extensive version of this dictionary by the CJK Dictionary Institute is also published by Kodansha called the Kodansha Kanji Dictionary. The dictionary arranges entries according to an original system called SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns). The dictionary also has indexing by radical and character readings. SKIP The SKIP method encodes Kanji into four main categories: Left-Right, Up-Down, Enclosure, and Whole; and then by stroke count (or by subtype of the Whole category). The SKIP method used by the Kodansha Learner's Dictionary is an original system for indexing kanji, meant to be accessible to those who have no prior knowledge of them. Instead of organizing kanji based on radicals, they are organized based on pattern. Based on how a kanji can be divided into sections, they are grouped into four main categories: Left-Right (1), Up-Down (2), Enclosure (3), and Solid (4). Users then count the number of strokes in each segment, and use them to determine the kanji's SKIP number. Since December 12, 2014, the SKIP coding system and all established SKIP codes have been released for public use under a Creative Commons licence. =Determining SKIP numbers= 1) Left- Right Left-Right kanji are those which can be broken down into sections segmented vertically such as Êòé (bright), which can be broken down into the left segment Êó• (sun) and the right segment Êúà (moon). Thus, Êòé would be in the first main category (Left-Right), would have four strokes in its left segment and four in its right, giving it a SKIP number 1-4-4. In the above example, the kanji can be broken down into two segments, both of which are actual radicals, but such does not need to be the case. The kanji Ê∏¨ (measure) can be broken down into three segments Ê∞µ (water), Ë≤ù (shell money), and ÂàÇ (knife). In such cases, the leftmost discrete element is treated as the left segment, and the rest of the kanji as the right segment. Therefore, Ê∏¨ is split into the left segment of Ê∞µand the right segment of Ââá (rule), and the resulting SKIP number is 1-3-9. 2) Up-Down Up-Down kanji are kanji that can be broken down into sections segmented horizontally such as Áî∑ (male), which can be broken down into the up segment Áî∞ (rice field) and the down segment Âäõ (power). Thus, Áî∑ would be in the second main category (Up-Down), would have five strokes in its up section and two strokes in its down section, giving it a SKIP number of 2-5-2. Again, the up and down sections do not necessarily need to be radicals, and can consist of more than two segments. The kanji Ëñ¨ (medicine) can be split into three segments. In such cases, the topmost discrete element is the up segment, while the remainder of the kanji (Ê•Ω) is the down segment. Thus, Ëñ¨ has a SKIP number of 2-3-13. 3) Enclosure Enclosure kanji are those where one element borders or surrounds other elements of the kanji. Such elements can border other elements on two sides (Ëøë and Áóá), three sides (È¢® and Âå∫), or completely surround the other elements (Âõ≤). In SKIP numbers for enclosure kanji, the bordering element's stroke count comes first, followed by the stroke count of the elements inside the enclosure. Thus, the SKIP number of È¢® (wind) is 3-2-7. 4) Solid Solid kanji are kanji that cannot be easily broken down into elements based on the patterns of the other categories. Often these kanji are formed from a single radical. Solid kanji are broken down into four sub-patterns: #Top line ‚Äì Kanji which have a prominent horizontal stroke at the top, e.g. ËÄ≥ (ear) and Â≠ê (child). #Bottom line ‚Äì Kanji which have a prominent horizontal stroke at the bottom, e.g. ‰∏ä (up) and ‰∏ò (hill). #Through line ‚Äì Kanji which have a prominent vertical stroke through the middle, e.g. Êú¨ (book) and ‰∏≠ (middle). #Others ‚Äì Kanji which cannot be placed in the preceding sub-patterns, e.g. Â•≥ (woman) and ‰∏∏ (circle). SKIP numbers for Solid kanji follow the following pattern: 4 (the main category) ‚Äì (the stroke count for the entire kanji) ‚Äì (the number of the sub-pattern). Thus, the SKIP number of Â≠ê is 4-3-1 and the SKIP number for Êú¨ is 4-5-3. =Aids in searching= In its index for kanji, pages where a user might erroneously expect a kanji to be located (either because of incorrect classification or incorrect stroke count) are cross-referenced with their correct SKIP number.

History  Dadivank Former Soviet Shahumyan district and the territory known as \\"Getashen subdistrict\\" where Shahumyan Province was originally formed In antiquity the territory was a part of Artsakh; in the Middle Ages it was part of the principality of Khachen; in the 17-18th centuries, the territory formed part of Melik-Abovian dynasty's melikdomRaffi. Melikdoms of Khamsa. of Gulistan, with its capital in the fortress of that name. During Soviet times in the area was renamed after the Armenian Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan, its administrative center taking the same name. By the 1990s the population of Shahumian district was mostly Armenian by language and ethnicity, though the area was not included within the boundaries of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast by the Soviet Union. In the spring/summer of 1991, Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev ordered Operation RingKarabagh Massacres Chronicle in which the Soviet Red Army and Azerbaijani OMON surrounded some of the area's Armenian villages (notably Getashen and Martunashen) and deported their inhabitants to Armenia. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in Shahumian's twenty-three villages were deported out of the region. In December 1991 with the Soviet Union imploding, Shahumian was claimed by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and became the focus of considerable fighting. This reached a climax in summer 1992 when most of the area was retaken by the Azerbaijan army. The damage was severe and the Armenian population fled. The historical name of the town of Shahumian was abolished and renamed to A≈üaƒüƒ± Aƒücak…ônd in 1992 and it has been partly repopulated by ethnic Azerbaijanis, most of whom are internally displaced persons who were deported from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts. During Operation Ring, Soviet forces acting in conjunction with the local Azerbaijani OMON forcibly deported Armenians living in the villages of the region of Shahumyan.Mutalibov stated in this regard, \\"–Ø –ø–æ–º–Ω—é, –∫–∞–∫ –º—ã –≤ —Å–≤–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –æ—á–∏—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –æ—Ç –∞—Ä–º—è–Ω –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 30 —Å–µ–ª –≤–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ –ì—è–Ω–¥–∂–∏... –ú—ã –±—ã–ª–∏ –±–ª–∏–∑–∫–∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ –∫ –æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—é –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ –ö–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ö–∞, –Ω–æ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–∏, —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–∏—è, –º–µ–∂–¥–æ—É—Å–æ–±–∏—Ü—ã —Å–≤–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ—Ç –Ω–∞—à–∏ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—è\\" (I remember how we with the help of Russians managed to cleanse from Armenians 30 villages around Ganja‚Ä¶ we were even close to the liberation of the whole Karabakh but our inner disagreements diminished our efforts). 1news.az 18 Nov. 2008 –ê—è–∑ –ú—É—Ç–∞–ª–∏–±–æ–≤: \\"–ï—Å–ª–∏ –º—ã —Å –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–æ–π –±—É–¥–µ–º –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å —á–µ—Ç–∫–æ, —è –¥—É–º–∞—é, –º—ã —Å–º–æ–∂–µ–º –∑–∞–≤–æ–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å –µ–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ –ö–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ö—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–µ\\" The operation involved the use of ground troops, military, armored vehicles and artillery.

It is stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. The wing is also the host unit at Fairchild. The wing carries out air refueling, passenger and cargo airlift, and aero-medical evacuation missions. Its 92d Operations Group is a successor organization to the World War II 92d Bombardment Group. It was the first VIII Bomber Command Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombardment group to bomb strategic targets in Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany from RAF Bovingdon, England in September 1942. From 1948 to 1992, the 92d Bombardment Wing was a part of Strategic Air Command's nuclear deterrent force during the Cold War. The 92d Air Refueling Wing is commanded by Colonel Derek M. Salmi, Its Vice Commander is Colonel Jeremiah S. Heathman and Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Lee P. Mills. History 92nd BG B-29s bombing a target in Korea, September 1950. General Electric J47-GE-19 turbojets. Shows 326th Bombardment Squadron emblem, red/yellow tail flashes. The wing's origins lie with the 92d Bombardment Group, first established during World War II. On 17 November 1947, the 92d Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy was organized at Spokane Army Air Field, Washington as part of the United States Air Force's wing base reorganization, in which combat groups and all supporting units on a base were assigned to a single wing.Ravenstein, p. xxi The 92d Bombardment Group, flying Boeing B-29 Superfortresses became its operational component. It served as a double-sized B-29 wing until April 1950, and again from May 1950 to April 1951, although one bomb group was generally deployed overseas for training or combat in Korea. It also supervised the 454th Bombardment Group, a Reserve corollary bomb group from June 1949 until February 1951, when the 454th was called to active duty for the Korean War.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 329 Upon return to the United States, the wing reequipped with the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. In August and September 1953, the wing completed the first mass flight of B-36s to the Far East in Operation Big Stick. The 92d visited bases in Japan, Okinawa and Guam. Big Stick followed close on the heels of the end of hostilities in Korea and was intended to show American determination to keep the peace in the Far East. On 15 and 16 October 1954 the wing deployed to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam for 90 days. This was the first deployment of an entire wing of Peacemakers to an overseas base.Knaack, p. 36 The wing deployed to Andersen again from 26 April until 6 July 1956. The wing added air refueling operations to bombardment mission in September 1957. From March to June 1959, the wing participated in Operation Head Start III, a precursor to Operation Chrome Dome. The 92d kept five of its Stratofortresses airborne at all times, with crews flying 24 hour missions with the support of ten KC-135 tankers. In January 1961, SAC disclosed it was maintaining an airborne force for \\"airborne alert training.\\"Narducci, pp. 5-6 From July 1961 to August 1965, controlled an SM-65E Atlas missile squadron. Supported SAC activities in Southeast Asia from early 1965 to December 1975 through deployment of bomber and tanker aircraft and crews and Air Weather 9thWS Det3. In 1969, supplied aircraft for Operation Giant Lance over Alaska, a secret mission designed to intimidate the Soviet Union into backing away from supporting the North Vietnamese. From March‚ÄìSeptember 1968, March‚ÄìSeptember 1969, and June 1972-October 1973, all wing Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses and many Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, plus aircrews and support personnel, were involved in Southeast Asia operations. After 1975, performed joint USAF/US Navy sea reconnaissance and surveillance missions. In 1983, the Wing's B-52Gs were modified to carry AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM). In 1985, upgraded to B-52H with improved strategic weapons carriage and offensive electronics capabilities. Earned the Fairchild Trophy in 1953, 1986, and again in 1992 when it won SAC's last competition and retired the trophy. Also won the Saunders Trophy for best air refueling unit in SAC for 1992. Provided KC-135 aircraft to tanker task forces in the US, Europe, and the Pacific through 1992. =Post Cold War era= Ended B-52 alert duties in September 1992, and ended bombardment mission in 1994, with transfer from Air Combat Command to Air Mobility Command upon departure of last B-52H. On 24 June 1994, a B-52H practicing for an airshow crashed on the airfield while making an unauthorized, low altitude, steep turn. The aircraft exceeded 90 degrees of bank, entered a stall and impacted the ground killing all on board, including the squadron commander and chief of standardization-evaluation. The pilot, Lt Col Arthur \\"Bud\\" Holland, maneuvered the bomber beyond its operational limits and lost control. The aircraft stalled, fell to the ground and exploded, killing Holland and the other three USAF officers aboard. The crash was captured on video and was shown repeatedly on news broadcasts throughout the world.Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 125, Thompson, Way, Way Off in the Wild Blue Yonder, USAF, AFR 110-14, pp. 2‚Äì3, and Kern, Darker Shades of Blue. As a purely air refueling unit, the group's squadrons routinely augmented AMC's overseas tanker task forces in Panama, Europe, Turkey, and Southwest Asia, providing aerial refueling to attack and transport aircraft. The wing deployed personnel and aircraft to expeditionary bases in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Spain as part of the Kosovo War (NATO \\"Operation Allied Force\\") in 1999. That year, the Wing became the 92d Air Expeditionary Wing at Mor√≥n Air Base in Spain, tasked with providing fuel to NATO aircraft involved in the war. In addition to serving as the HQ 92 AEW (serving units in France, Crete, Sicily and Spain), Mor√≥n hosted 37 tankers (KC-135 and KC-10) and 800 personnel. The 92 AEW became the largest tanker wing since the Vietnam War and held the distinction of being the largest tanker base during the Kosovo War. In the mid-2010s, wing staff officially stated that the wing 'operate[d] 34 KC-135 R/T Stratotanker refueling aircraft valued at $1.6 billion and 58 aircrews to support worldwide military missions. Serving as Fairchild Air Force Base host unit, the wing control[led] and 1,248 buildings. The wing employ[ed] over 2,200 active-duty military, as well as over 700 civilian employees.' =Structure in the late 2010s= The 92d Air Refueling Wing is structured under four groups: Operations, maintenance, mission support and medical, as well as 12 staff agencies organized under the Director of Staff. * 92d Operations Group : Primarily responsible for the 2 flying squadrons - the 92d and 93d Air Refueling Squadrons, which fly the KC-135 Stratotanker. The 92d Operations Support Squadron manages functions such as intelligence, weather, tactics, aircrew training, life support supervision, airfield management, air traffic control, combat crew communications and current operations. The 92d OSS is also responsible for managing the airfield, weather station, control tower and flight simulator for the wing. * 92d Maintenance Group : Provides field-level maintenance support for 34 KC-135 R/T aircraft and 240 pieces of aerospace ground equipment supporting peace and wartime worldwide aerial refueling and airlift operations. The group also provides services for transient contract and military aircraft. Furthermore, the 92d Maintenance Group maintains a high state of combat readiness for over 650 personnel and equipment supporting worldwide contingency and nuclear deterrence operations, while also maintaining base munitions. * 92d Mission Support Group : Provides professional civil engineer, communications, contracting, logistics, mission support, security forces, and combat, community, and family support services. Additionally, through the wing's Air Expeditionary Force Cell, the 92d MSG integrates all wing readiness functions to train, deploy and reintegrate up to 1,300 personnel annually who deploy worldwide. * 92d Medical Group : Serves more than 12,640 military beneficiaries, with a staff of 308 and an annual budget of $12.3 million. The medical clinic receives over 53,688 outpatient visits and 12,975 dental visits annually. The group currently manages the 92d Aeromedical Dental Squadron, 92d Medical Operations Squadron and the 92d Medical Support Squadron. Wing staff agencies consist of a variety of functions. These functions include legal, plans and programs, safety, command and control, chapel, public affairs, military equal opportunity, sexual assault prevention program, protocol, history and the inspector general.

It has historically been the region's most important church. One of the best pieces of Armenian architecture of the mid-1200s, the building is best known among scholars for its richly decorated dome. History =Background= The name Gandzasar, which means \\"treasure mountain\\" in Armenian, is believed to have originated from the tradition that the monastery was built on a hill containing ores of silver and other metals. The site was first mentioned in written records by the tenth century Catholicos Anania of Moks (r. 946-968), who listed Sargis, a monk from Gandzasar, among the participants of a 949 council convened in Khachen to reconcile Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian Armenians. Khachkars dated 1174, 1182, 1202 have been found around the monastery which also point to the existence of a church or monastery at the site. The foundation inscription on the interior wall. =Foundation= The main church was built between 1216 and 1238 by Hasan-Jalal (Islamic name), the Armenian prince of Inner Khachen and the patriarch of the House of Hasan-Jalalyan. It was consecrated on July 22, 1240, on the Feast of the Transfiguration (Vardavar) in attendance of some 700 priests. The gavit (narthex), to the west of the church, was started in 1240 completed in 1266 by Atabek, the son of Hasan-Jalal and his wife, Mamkan. Kirakos Gandzaketsi, a contemporary historian, described the construction of the church in his History of Armenia. Gandzasar became the seat of the Catholicosate of (Caucasian) Albania, a see of the Armenian Apostolic Church, in the late 14th century. Rouben Paul Adalian considers the foundation of the see a result of an ancient bishopric seeking \\"ecclesiastical autonomy to compensate for the lack of control and communication from a central pontificate\\" and part of various local strategies in an Armenia dominated by foreign and Islamic rule to \\"preserve some semblance of religious authority among the people\\". In the 16th century it became subordinate to the Etchmiadzin catholicosate. =Later history= Since its foundation the monastery was a center of education and manuscript production. According to contemporary sources, in early 1700s the patriarch of Gandzasar had authority over some 900 villages with hundreds of households in each, composed of peasant and merchant Armenians.; originally published in In the 17th and 18th centuries Gandzasar became the center in the liberation efforts by Karabakh Armenian meliks, who were united around Catholicos Yesayi Hasan-Jalalyan (d. 1728). He was staunchly pro-Russian and in a 1701 letter signed by Karabakh and Syunik meliks, he asked Peter the Great to protect Armenians from Muslims. However, it was not until the early 1800s that the Russian Empire took control of the region. The Karabakh Khanate eventually came under complete Russian control through the Treaty of Gulistan. Through the 1836 regulation by the Russian authorities, known as Polozhenie, Gandzasar ceased to be the seat of the diocese of Karabakh, which was moved to Shusha. It was gradually abandoned and became dilapidated by the late 19th century. =Soviet period= Gandzasar was closed down by the Soviet authorities no later than 1930. The diocese of Artsakh was reestablished in 1989. Archbishop Pargev Martirosyan was named its primate. Due to his efforts, Gandzasar reopened on October 1, 1989 after six months of renovations. The Soviet government had given permission, while that of Soviet Azerbaijan had not. Gandzasar became the first church to be reopened after decades of suppression. According to Zori Balayan several KGB agents \\"could [have been] spotted among the crowd attending.\\" Gandzasar served as seat of the bishop before it was moved to Ghazanchetsots Cathedral in Shusha (Shushi) in 1998. =Nagorno-Karabakh War= Gandzasar was attacked several times during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. On July 6, 1991 Soviet soldiers and OMON (special police) officers raided Gandzasar allegedly in search of guns. They checked papers and conducted a thorough search, including in the graveyard. Fierce fighting took place around Gandzasar in 1992, when Azerbaijan sieged the area. The Armenians broke the siege, which saved Gandzasar and enhanced its spiritual status, wrote Thomas de Waal. On August 16, 1992 some of the outlying buildings within the monastery complex were destroyed as a result of Azerbaijani bombardment by helicopters, which intentionally targeted the church. Corley writes that the attempted bombing of Gandzasar was not of any military importance and that its raid \\"appeared to be a deliberate attempt to attack the Armenian heritage in Karabakh.\\" On August 31, 1992 Armenia's Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Serzh Sargsyan, the head of the self-defense committee of Karabakh Armenians, convened the first meeting of the region's commanders in one of the monastic cells of Gandzasar. On January 20, 1993 an air strike conducted by two Azerbaijani attack aircraft caused serious damage to the monastery and killed several people nearby and wounded a priest. =Restoration and revival= Following the war, the monastery was completely refurbished through the funding of Russia-based businessman and philanthropist Levon Hayrapetyan, a native of Vank.A plaque on its walls reads in Armenian and Russian: \\"The cathedral, gavit, and the monastic complex was restored by funds of Mr. Levon Hayrapetyan in 1999\\" Restoration works, which lasted from 2000 to 2002, included restoration of the altar, gavit, and tiling of the floor. Hayrapetyan also funded the asphalting of the road leading to the church. Some controversy surrounded the tiling of the wall around the monastery in 2011. It was funded by Hayrapetyan and carried out by a company owned by Vladimir Hayrapetyan, his younger brother. While Archbishop Pargev Martirosyan said the wall was not medieval and did not have much architectural significance, therefore tiling was justified, critics argued it was part of the historic complex. On October 16, 2008 a mass wedding, sponsored by Levon Hayrapetyan took place in Karabakh. Some 700 couples got married on that day, 500 of whom married at Ghazanchetsots Cathedral in Shushi and 200 at Gandzasar. On April 13, 2016 Catholicos Karekin II and Catholicos of Cilicia Aram I delivered a prayer for peace and safety of Nagorno-Karabakh. It came days after the clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces which were the deadliest since the ceasefire of 1994. The monastery's 770th anniversary was commemorated in 2010 and the 777th anniversary in 2017. Description Aerial view of the monastery complex in 2018 The monastery is located atop a hill, at an altitude of , to the south- west of the village of Vank (Azerbaijani: V…ôngli) in the province of Martakert. The walled monastery complex includes the church with its narthex (gavit), living quarters, bishop's residence, refectory, and a school building. The living quarters, located on the northern side contain eight cells (), were built in the 17th century. On the eastern side there is a refectory, built circa 1689. The two-floored school building was erected in 1898. To the south of the monastery walls is the old cemetery, where priests, bishops and notable laypeople (such as meliks) of the areas were buried. =Architecture= The main church, named for John the Baptist, has a rectangular, cruciform plan with two-floored sacristies (chambers) on four corners. In its style, it is similar to the plans of the main churches of Geghard, Hovhannavank and Harichavank, also built in the 13th century.Thierry, Jean-Michel and Patrick Donabedian. Les Arts Arm√©niens. Paris, 1987.Thierry, Jean. Eglises et Couvents du Karabagh. Antelais, Lebanon, 1991, pp. 161-165 The church's exterior dimensions are variously given as or . The church is prominent for its richly decorated 16-sided dome. The bas-reliefs on its exterior depict the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary with baby Jesus, Adam and Eve, two ktetors (patrons) holding the model of the church, geometrical figures, such as rosettes, head of a bull and an eagle. The bas-reliefs have been compared to the elaborate carvings of Aghtamar.See Comneno, Lala M., Cuneo, P, and Manukian, S. Volume 19: Gharabagh. Documents of Armenian Art - Documenti di Architettura Armena Series. Polytechnique and the Armenian Academy of Sciences, Milan, OEMME Edizioni, 1980, Introduction Anatoli L. Yakobson called Gandzasar an \\"encyclopedia\\" of Armenian architecture, while Bagrat Ulubabyan and M. S. Asatryan described it as a \\"jewel\\". The interior pendentives under the cylindrical dome in the interior are decorated with geometrical ornaments such as stars, circles and squares, plants such as spiral shoots, palmettes. Each side of the pendentive has high reliefs depicting head of a sheep, heads of a bull and anthropomorphic figures. According to Yakobson, sheep and bulls were considered holy animals in this period and are used as protectors of the structure. The narthex (gavit), measured , is a square-plan hall with two columns near the eastern wall that support the roof. It is very similar to the gavit of the Holy Cross church of Haghpat Monastery. The portal on western facade of the gavit is richly decorated. Significance A 2013 Armenian stamp depicting Gandzasar. Gandzasar is the principal historic tourist attraction in all of Karabakh (Artsakh) and one of the top destinations overall. It is also a center of pilgrimage as the region's main historic cathedral both for Karabakh Armenians and tourists (of Armenian ancestry). Thomas de Waal noted as early as 1997 that Gandzasar, the most famous church in Karabakh, \\"has acquired a mythical status in Karabakh.\\" Felix Corley wrote that it is, along with Ghazanchetsots Cathedral in Shushi (Shusha), a powerful symbol of history and identity of Karabakh Armenians regardless their religiosity. Azerbaijani revisionism A 2014 Azerbaijani stamp depicting the monastery, presenting it as Caucasian Albanian. In the late Soviet period, since 1970s Azerbaijani historians, particularly Rashid Geyushev asserted a revisionist theory that postulated that Gandzasar was a monument of culture and religion of Caucasian Albania. The main point in this clam is the fact that Gandzasar was the seat of the Albanian Catholicosate of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The theory was adopted and promoted by other Azerbaijani historians, such as Davud Akhundov. It has also been adopted by Azerbaijan's authorities. For instance, in 2017, Hikmet Hajiyev, Spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry, stated that Gandzasar is an \\"Albanian Christian temple, occupied by the Armenian armed forces in the Kalbajar region, is not Gandzasar, but Ganjasar, and has nothing to do with the Armenian Gregorian Church.\\" This discredited claim has been rebutted by numerous scholars, including Victor Schnirelmann, who notes that Caucasian Albania disappeared from history in the 10th century and the Armenian Church simply adopted the name for its easternmost diocese due to tradition. Schnirelmann notes that Azerbaijani historians intentionally omit the fact that Gandzasar is a typical example of Armenian architecture of 10th-13th centuries, as well as the numerous Armenian inscriptions on its walls. Thomas de Waal noted that in a 1997 pamphlet titled \\"The Albanian Monuments of Karabakh\\" by Igrar Aliyev and Kamil Mamedzade \\"carefully left out all the Armenian writing\\" in the drawing of the fa√ßade of Gandzasar on its cover. Rouben Galichian notes that Gandzasar, though presented in Azerbaijan as supposedly an \\"Albanian- Azerbaijani\\" historic monastery and a part of Azerbaijan's cultural heritage, was left to decay under Azerbaijani control.

Features  The synthesizer's main features are six-voice polyphony (with unison and chord memory voice assignment modes), 32 memory slots for patches and cassette port for backing up patches, and an arpeggiator. At the time of its release, the Polysix, along with the contemporary Roland Juno-6, was one of the first affordably priced polyphonic analog synthesizers. It cost about twice as much as the competing Juno-6 but had more features. It also had on-board patch storage and backup which the cheaper Juno lacked until the upgraded Juno-60 model. Korg developed the Polysix with an eye on the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, trying to provide some of the features found on the more expensive synth in a compact, reliable and much cheaper design. While not as powerful, it used SSM2044 4-pole voltage-controlled filters, giving the Polysix a warm, rounded, and organic sound. Although the Polysix only had one oscillator per voice, it also featured built in chorus, phaser, and 'ensemble' effects (using a 'bucket brigade' analog delay line design), to provide a fuller sound.  Oscillators  A typical VCO-equipped synthesizer issue concerns the VCO auto-tuning, to compensate slight out-of-tune behavior during a live performance. Almost all VCO-based analog synthesizers of that era did provide an Auto-Tuning pushbutton, to start an alignment routine and keep all oscillators equal tuned. This because a generic concept did use one hexponential converter to drive each VCO, and the hexp conversion was the weak point of the chain. The Korg Polysix did employ a quite original idea: there is only one hexp converter, multiplexed towards the six linear VCOs; therefore all VCOs, individually compensated, does track equally and the single hexponential converter only is responsible for tuning. This is the reason because the Polysix didn't had a Tune pushbutton.  Audio path  The Polysix had a straightforward synthesis architecture. Each voice had one oscillator with sawtooth wave, variable pulse wave, or PWM outputs. The PWM section had its own LFO. In addition, there is a sub-oscillator that allows the addition of a square wave either one or two octaves below the main VCO pitch. The filter has controls for cutoff frequency, resonance, envelope amount and keyboard tracking. The envelope control has a center zero, letting the user select either a normal or an inverted envelope. The envelope is an ADSR type. The VCA can be operated from either the envelope or a gate signal. The mixed sound of all the voices can be sent to an effects section, which offers three modulated delay-based effects (Chorus, Phase or Ensemble setting). This acts to fatten the sound considerably, and was a key feature at the time of release.  Modulation  The LFO (known here as a 'modulation generator') is a simple triangle wave that can be routed to the VCO, VCF or VCA. It has a variable delay before it is triggered.  Reliability  Although built into a substantial (and heavy) chipboard case, the Polysix has some reliability problems. Like other programmable synthesizers of the era, it had a rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery that powered the memory when the unit was switched off. The original batteries are now well past their designed lifespan and thus prone to failure, leaving the instrument unable to recall user designed patches from its memory. More seriously, if the battery is not replaced, it can leak and corrode the circuits. Unfortunately for the Polysix, this battery is mounted on the main processor board and corrosion here can be fatally damaging to the circuitry of the instrument. Some instruments of its era had begun the move towards digital technology by using DCOs or microprocessor-generated envelopes. The Polysix, however, used a separate analog VCO, VCF and envelope generator for each voice. Whilst this might have benefits for the richness of the sound, the extra complexity also brings greater tuning problems and more possibilities for failure. The Polysix keyboard used a light plastic keyboard with conductive rubber contacts. These contacts are often the source of 'dead' keys on the keyboard. This is probably the most common problem on old Polysix units, and one shared with some other Korg instruments that used the same keyboard, such as the Poly-61 and Mono/Poly. The patch recall buttons also have a tendency to fail. Software There is a software emulator of the Polysix included in the Korg Legacy Collection called Polysix Legacy Edition. This software is a full digital replica (emulation) of the hardware Polysix. And was also part of the LAC-1 expansion for the Korg OASYS and is one of the Korg Kronos sound engines. More recently, KORG introduced a mobile iOS application for iPad ( iPolysix ), which faithfully reproduces the dynamics of the original. In July 2013, KORG introduced a PolySix instrument for Propellerhead Reason 7.

Biography Christian Albert was a son of Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and his wife Princess Marie Elisabeth of Saxony. He became duke when his father died in the Castle T√∂nning, besieged by the King Christian V of Denmark. He was forced to flee at that point, and the remainder of his life was characterized by his fight with Denmark. Later, he was to marry the daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark, a marital alliance arranged in the hope for peace, but it changed nothing. Frederica Amalia. During Christian Albert's reign, the connection with Sweden, initiated by his father, was strengthened, which provided some protection. However, this also led to the duchy being pulled into all of Sweden's conflicts, including the Great Northern War and several wars with Denmark. From 1675 to 1689, Christian Albert lived in exile in Hamburg. However, with the aid of the Holy Roman Emperor and the European allies, he managed to force the Danish king to sign the so-called Altonaer Vergleich, which allowed him to regain his former position. Christian Albert made some contribution to culture, education and the arts. On 5 October 1665, he founded the University of Kiel. In 1678, he took part in the founding of the Hamburg Oper am G√§nsemarkt. Both he and his father, Frederick III, extended patronage to the painter J√ºrgen Ovens, who worked for more than thirty years with them. Family and children Christian Albert married, on 24 October 1667, Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark, daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick- L√ºneburg. They had the following children: # Sophie Amalie (19 January 1670 - 27 February 1710), married on 7 July 1695 to Prince Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. # Duke Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp (18 October 1671 ‚Äì 19 July 1702), patrilineal ancestor of all Russian emperors after Catherine II. # Duke Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp (11 January 1673 - 24 April 1726), whose eldest-surviving son established a new dynasty in Sweden-Finland. # Marie Elisabeth (21 March 1678 - 17 July 1755), Abbess of Quedlinburg. Agnatic progeny of his elder son ended up on the throne of Russia, and agnatic progeny of the younger son - on the thrones of Sweden and Oldenburg.

In the 2000s Chambers has been frequently used by Italian producers Alle and Benny Benassi who she first met when she did the vocals for a track by the Italian dance act J.K., that the Benassis produced. She also toured with Italian singer Giorgia. As a songwriter, Chambers contributed to the Corona project.

She grew up in Vouthon-Bas and later married Jacques d'Arc. The couple moved to Domr√©my, where they owned a farm consisting of about of land. After their daughter's famous exploits in 1429, the family was granted noble status by Charles VII in December of that year. Isabelle moved to Orl√©ans in 1440 after her husband's death and received a pension from the city. She petitioned Pope Nicholas V to reopen the court case that had convicted Joan of heresy, and then, in her seventies, addressed the opening session of the appellate trial at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. The appeals court overturned Joan's conviction on 7 July 1456. Isabelle died two years later, probably at Sandillon near Orl√©ans. Biography Isabelle Rom√©e was a native of Vouthon- Bas, a village near Domr√©my where she and her husband Jacques d'Arc settled. Together they owned about of land and a modest house. Isabelle Rom√©e may have earned her surname from a pilgrimage to Rome. Surnames were not universal in the early 15th century and a woman could be known by a different one from her husband.

Isabelle Rom√©e gave her daughter a religious, Catholic upbringing and taught her the craft of spinning wool. She also had three sons, Jacquemin, Jean, and Pierre, and a daughter named Catherine, though little is known about her life. Like the rest of the immediate family, she was ennobled by royal grant on 29 December 1429. She moved to Orl√©ans in 1440 after her husband's death and received a pension from the city. Isabelle Rom√©e spent the rest of her life restoring her daughter's name. She petitioned Pope Nicholas V to reopen the court case that had convicted Joan of heresy. An inquiry finally opened in 1449. The chief inquisitor of France, Jean Br√©hal, took up the case and conducted an initial investigation in May 1452. On 7 November 1455, after the reign of Pope Callixtus III had begun, Isabelle traveled to Paris to visit the delegation from the Holy See. Although she was over seventy years old, she addressed the assembly with a moving speech. It began, \\"I had a daughter, born in legitimate marriage, whom I fortified worthily with the sacraments of baptism and confirmation and raised in the fear of God and respect for the tradition of the Church,\\" and ended, \\"‚Ä¶without any aid given to her innocence in a perfidious, violent, and iniquitous trial, without a shadow of right‚Ä¶ they condemned her in a damnable and criminal fashion and made her die most cruelly by fire.\\" Isabelle attended most of the appellate trial sessions despite poor health. The appeals court overturned the conviction on 7 July 1456. Isabelle died on 28 November 1458, likely in the village of Sandillon near Orleans.

A keylock or toe hold can be referred to as a figure-four hold, when it involves a figure-four formation with the legs or arms. If the figure- four involves grabbing the wrists with both hands, it is called a double wrist lock; known as kimura in MMA circles. A figure-four hold done with the legs around the neck and (usually) arm of an opponent is called figure-four (leg-)choke, better known as a triangle choke these days, and is a common submission in modern mixed martial arts, Submission wrestling and Brazilian jiu jitsu, and of course Catch wrestling. In addition to Lancashire, or catch- as-catch-can wrestling, the move was also found in Japanese jiu-jitsu, and was thereafter incorporated into Judo. The leg figure-four choke is also part of Japanese martial arts, where it is known as Sankaku-Jime. References External links *The Double Wrist Lock. Shows extensive use of the figure- four hold.

He is known for his involvement with Nocturnal Projections and This Kind Of Punishment as well as his extensive solo and collaborative work.  History  In 1981 Peter and his brother Graeme Jefferies formed the post-punk band Nocturnal Projections. The band released a few records, and performed around their hometown of New Plymouth, as well as Auckland. After Nocturnal Projections disbanded in 1983, the brothers formed This Kind Of Punishment, and released three full-length albums and an EP. In 1985 Jefferies released the Randolph's Going Home 7\\" and the \\"fish out of water\\" 12\\" with Shayne Carter. This was followed in 1986 with the At Swim 2 Birds LP, recorded with Jono Lonie, on the Flying Nun label. This was reissued on Xpressway and later on Drunken Fish. The Catapult 7\\", a collaboration with Robbie Muir, was released on Xpressway in 1989, reissued by the Chicago-based Ajax label in 1991. Further recordings by Jefferies and Muir were released by Ajax in 1992 as the double 7\\" Swerve. The Last Great Challenge in a Dull World album was released on cassette by the Xpressway label in 1990. Another collaboration with Shayne Carter, the Knocked Out or Thereabout 7\\", was released on Flying Nun in 1992. The Electricity LP was released on Ajax in 1994, followed by Elevator Madness on Emperor Jones in 1996, then Substatic on Trance Syndicate in 1998, and Closed Circuit in 2001 (also on Trance Syndicate). Jefferies formed 2 Foot Flame with Jean Smith of Mecca Normal. The band released two LPs on Matador Records, 1995's self titled LP, and 1997's Ultra Drowning. The Last Great Challenge in a Dull World was re-issued in 2013 on vinyl by de Stijl records. At Swim 2 Birds was reissued by Flying Nun records in 2017.

It strongly opposed unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from NATO as advocated by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, supporting instead the replacement of Polaris by Trident and the deployment of NATO cruise missiles after the Soviet Union began deploying its SS20 missiles in 1977.Wittner, L., The Struggle Against the Bomb, Volume 3, Stanford University Press, 2003 The basis of the CPS case was set out in detail in a book published towards the end of the campaign, Paul Mercer's \\"Peace\\" of the Dead,Paul Mercer, \\"Peace\\" of the Dead: The truth behind the nuclear disarmers() 1986. and many of its arguments at the time can still be found on the website of Julian Lewis, formerly its Research Director. Its main activists were Julian Lewis, Edward Leigh, Tony Kerpel and, for its first year only, Francis Holihan. It was said to have close relations with the Institute for the Study of Conflict, the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Centre for Policy Studies. The CPS was said to have close links with Conservative leaders. It was endorsed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and rented its offices in Whitehall, London, from Jeffrey Archer. It was associated with the Campaign For Defence and Multilateral Disarmament (CDMD), which was run by Conservative Central Office. The CDMD included Winston Churchill, Conservative Party Chairman John Selwyn Gummer, Minister of State for Defence Peter Blaker, MOD spokesman Ray Whitney, Secretary of State for Defence Michael Heseltine and Conservative ex-Chairman Cecil Parkinson. The Economist newspaper reported in 1983 that the CPS had had meetings with Blaker.Tom Mills, Tom Griffin and David Miller, The Cold War on British Muslims, Spinwatch, 2011 The Guardian newspaper reported that Churchill was appointed by Thatcher to co-ordinate the Government's campaign against CND. Parkinson was also involved with the CPS, and, according to Dorril he passed them a list of Conservative Party agents. The CPMD was said to have distributed CPS literature. Amongst its activities were commissioning a series of Gallup polls showing levels of support for and opposition to British possession of nuclear weapons; providing speakers at public meetings and debates; highlighting what it considered to be the left-wing affiliations of leading CND figures; and mounting counter-demonstrations and stunts to undermine those organised by CND - for example, haranguing CND marchers from the roof of its offices and chartering a plane to fly over a CND festival with a banner reading, \\"Help the Soviets, Support CND!\\" The CPS also drew attention to peace movement links with other bodies, such as the World Peace Council (WPC), the World Federation of Scientific Workers (WFSW) and the Soviet Peace Committee (SPC), which were funded and controlled by the Soviet Union. The CPS attracted criticism for not revealing its sources of funding whilst alleging that parts of the anti-nuclear movement were funded by the Soviet Union.Bruce Kent, Undiscovered Ends The CPS was not a membership organisation and was financed by The 61, \\"a private sector operational intelligence agency\\"Joseph C. Goulden, \\"Crozier, covert acts, CIA and Cold War\\", The Washington Times, 15 May 1994 said by its founder, Brian Crozier, to be funded by \\"rich individuals and a few private companies\\".Brian Crozier, Letters: Churchill, the CIA and Clinton, The Guardian, 3 August 1998 The CPS was saidInstitute for European Defence and Strategic Studies\\", Pinkindustry blog to have also received funding from the Heritage Foundation in 1982.\\"Heritage Foundation‚Äôs influence on domestic political affairs\\", Pinkindustry blog Bruce Kent, the CND general secretary, said in his autobiography that Francis Holihan spied on CND. It was said that Holihan sent senior clerics in the Catholic Church material about Kent, that he organised the aerial propaganda against CND, that he entered CND offices under false pretences and that CPS workers joined CND in order to gain access to the Campaign's 1982 Annual Conference. A draft CPS leaflet, but not its printed version, also linked Bruce Kent, then General Secretary of CND, to IRA hunger-strikers. When Kent went on a speaking tour of America, Holihan was said to have followed him, critical material on Kent was sent to newspapers and radio stations and demonstrations were organised against him.The Lobster, No.3, 1984 The CPS and Holihan parted company before the end of 1982. With the decline in anti-nuclear agitation from 1985, and the Zero Option agreement in the 1987 INF Treaty to scrap both cruise and SS20 missiles, the organisers of the CPS pursued other political objectives. Tony Kerpel MBE became Chief of Staff to Conservative Party Chairman Kenneth Baker. Edward Leigh and Julian Lewis became Conservative MPs, for Gainsborough and New Forest East respectively. Though unconnected with them, the CPS may have inspired the emergence of similar overseas organisations like the New Zealand-based Peace Through Security, which was formed by conservative activist Dr Thomas Jim Sprott to oppose the Fourth Labour Government's anti-nuclear policy. Like the CPS, the New Zealand Peace through Security alleged that the local anti- nuclear movement had been infiltrated and manipulated by pro-Soviet Communist elements.Denis Small,\\"The Rise of the Pro-Nuclear Right,\\" New Zealand Monthly Review, November-December:5-8, 1986 Notes External links *BBC Report of a CPS Demonstration 1 April 1983 1981 establishments in the United Kingdom Nuclear weapons Organizations established in 1981 Political advocacy groups in the United Kingdom ","title":"Coalition for Peace through Security"},{"id":"4024627","text":"Amerasinghe Mudalige Jayantha Gamini Amerasinghe (born February 2, 1954, Colombo) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played in two Tests in 1984.

The second edition was independently released. The album cover features a cartoon by Garth Kauffman on the cover and refers to the band as \\"Fishtank Ensemble\\". Besides purely aesthetic differences, there are significant differences between the sound quality of the releases. Though both of the CDs have the same tracks in the same order, the Mimicry pressing of Super Raoul is inferior to the quality of the independent pressing; notably so on the songs \\"Hora di Bucharest/Hora de Fabrice\\" and \\"Suite Romaine\\". On the Mimicry pressing, these songs \\"skip\\", then abruptly silence repeatedly. This is most likely due to an error in transferring the data of the tracks.

She eventually died from her injury. She was being coached by Al Fong, and had previously been coached by Bela Karolyi. Her injury sparked major changes to the vaulting discipline of women's gymnastics with the goal of preventing such serious injuries. Career Gomez was born in San Antonio, Texas, the younger of two daughters born to a pair of former migrant farm workers from Laredo, Texas. Her parents, mother Otilia and father Ramiro, worked their way up from their farm working days to become a teacher and a welder, respectively, and struggled to keep their family together while giving 10-year-old budding gymnast Julissa a chance to train with renowned gymnastics coach B√©la K√°rolyi in Houston.\\"Tales from the vaults\\" Rebecca Seal, Guardian Unlimited, 4 December 2005. At the 1986 U.S. Championships, she placed fourth in the all-around in the junior division and won a place on the U.S. National Team.Results from 1986 Jr. Nationals at Gymn-Forum By 1987 she was representing the United States in international meets. Especially strong on the uneven bars and balance beam, Gomez was considered a legitimate contender for the 1988 U.S. Olympic team. In mid-1987, Gomez, wanting to move further up the rankings and reportedly frustrated with K√°rolyi's sometimes abusive training methods, decided to leave the K√°rolyis. After briefly training at US Acrosports in Webster, Texas,Results from 1987 U.S. Nationals at Gymn-Forum Gomez's search for a new coach led her to select Al Fong, who was the trainer of another up-and-coming gymnast eager to make the 1988 Olympic team, Christy Henrich. Though her parents had vowed to keep the family together no matter where Julissa's career took her, they decided that Ramiro would move with Julissa to Blue Springs, Missouri, where Fong's gymnastics club, Great American Gymnastics Express (GAGE), was located while Otilia would remain behind until Julissa's older sister Kristy finished school for the year. Injury and death In May 1988, several months before the Olympics, she traveled with her coach to Tokyo, Japan, to compete in the World Sports Fair. During the all-around competition, Gomez qualified for the vault finals. However, observers had noticed her struggle with the apparatus over the months leading up to the competition, including her former coach B√©la K√°rolyi, past and present teammates, and even her present coach Al Fong. Gomez's technique on the extremely difficult Yurchenko vault had been described as shaky at best, and Gomez was unable to perform the vault with any consistency during practices, sometimes missing her feet on the springboard. A teammate from K√°rolyi's, Chelle Stack, later stated, \\"You could tell it was not a safe vault for her to be doing. Someone along the way should have stopped her.\\" However, Julissa's coaches insisted that she needed to continue training and competing the Yurchenko vault in order to achieve high scores. During warmups for the final, held on May 5, 1988, Gomez continued to practice the Yurchenko. As she raced toward the vault on one of her practice runs, her foot slipped off the springboard and she slammed headfirst into the vaulting horse at high speed. The resulting impact instantly paralyzed her from the neck down.\\"Gymnast paralyzed\\" The New York Times, May 8, 1988. A subsequent accident at a Japanese hospital, in which she became disconnected from her ventilator, resulted in severe brain damage and left her in a coma. Gomez's family cared for her for three years before she succumbed to an infection and died in August 1991 in Houston. Aftermath Gomez's accident stands as one of the most serious to occur in artistic gymnastics, and helped prompt changes in the sport. In 1989, the International Gymnastics Federation decided to increase vaulting safety by allowing U-shaped springboard mats, traditionally utilized in practice to give all gymnasts a greater margin of error in preflight, to be used during competitions. The mat is now mandatory: the 2006 Code of Points specifies that performing a Yurchenko-style vault without the safety mat results in an automatic score of zero.Code of Points at the official website of the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG):Section 8.4, \\"Specific Apparatus Deductions (A Panel), page 34. In 2001, the traditional horse was completely phased out and replaced by a larger, more stable vaulting table to provide gymnasts with additional safety.

Patties Foods is represented in the Australian market by the Four'n Twenty, Patties, Herbert Adams, Nanna's, Chefs Pride, Boscastle and Snowy River brands. Patties is the largest Meat pie producing company in Australia, and the world. They are the producers of several well-known Meat pies, including the Patties, Snowy River pie, Herbert Adams pie, and as of 2003, Four'n Twenty pies. Patties Foods is headquartered in Bairnsdale, Victoria. History * Founded in 1966 by the Rijs family, immigrants from the Netherlands. * Based in Bairnsdale in Victoria's Gippsland region. * Publicly listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. * In 2003 Patties Foods expanded substantially, purchasing the Victorian brand Four'n Twenty from US multi-national Simplot, along with Simplot's other Australian bakery product lines and brand names. =A family company = Founded as Patties Bakeries, Originally a cake shop in Lakes Entrance, Victoria, in August 1966 Patties Bakery, originally named for the owner's wife Patty Neat, was purchased by Peter and Annie Rijs, whom emigrated from the Netherlands in 1956. In 1967 the Rijs family began to build business by introducing pies and bread rolls. The demand for Patties' product increased, prompting a series of shops and bakeries to be built, bought and sold. In 1985 a new factory was built and production was moved to Bairnsdale, where it continues to this day. The business continued to expand over the years, Patties began distribution in Melbourne in 1986, and in 1995 exporting to New Zealand. In 1993, Patties launched Arriba, a Mexican food range. In 1996, after pastry sales grew, Patties sold its bread business to Sunicrust in order to concentrate on pastry products. Demand for pastry products continued to grow, resulting in significant expansions to the factory. In 1998, a two million dollar plant renovation and extension took place, including installation of a spiral freezer. In 2000, a new parallel manufacturing line, capable of making all pasties, sausage rolls and finger foods, was installed, substantially increasing capacity. Australian iconic brands Four‚Äôn Twenty, Herbert Adams and Nanna's were purchased from American multi-national Simplot in 2003 and Patties began manufacturing the associated products in the Bairnsdale factory in 2004. In 2006, Patties was inducted into the Victorian Manufacturing Hall of Fame and the Gippsland Business Awards Hall of Fame. =A public company = Patties Foods was publicly listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and became publicly listed in 2006. The Rijs brothers, sons of the founding Mr and Mrs Rijs, retained 40% shareholding of the company. In 2007 Patties acquired the Chefs Pride and Creative Gourmet businesses, and introduced gluten free foods to its product roster. Since its founding, Patties Foods has grown into one of the largest pie manufacturers supplying the grocery market in Australia. The long-standing family MD and CEO, Richard Rijs, retired in November 2007. The non-executive director, Michelle Allen was appointed his replacement at that time. In September 2008, Greg Bourke, took over as MD/CEO after 20 years experience in senior executive roles for George Weston Foods in Australia and New Zealand. He resigned in September 2013 with the CFO Michael Knaap and Sales Director Tim Peters becoming acting CEOs. In April 2014 named Steven Chaur as their new Chief Executive Officer . During 2014 the company's frozen fruit packing line was closed with 18 people redeployed.

He has won three Kate Greenaway Medals as well as the British librarians' annual award for the best-illustrated children's book, and two of his works were commended runners-up, a distinction dropped after 2002. Books that he wrote or illustrated have won three Nestl√© Smarties Book Prizes and have been silver or bronze runners-up four times. On 9 June 2015, he was appointed the UK Children's Laureate. Life Chris Riddell was born in 1962 in Cape Town, South Africa, where his father was a \\"liberal Anglican vicar\\" and was opposed to the system of apartheid. The family returned to England when Chris was one year old, where he spent the rest of his childhood with his sister and three brothers, who now live in South Africa, Brighton, England, and Egypt. He attended Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School in Kennington. Chris displayed artistic talent from an early age and was encouraged in this by his mother. (She gave him paper and pen to keep quiet during his father's sermons.) As a child, he admired the work of Sir John Tenniel, the first illustrator of Alice in Wonderland, and W. Heath Robinson. At Brighton Polytechnic, he studied illustration; one teacher was Raymond Briggs, an earlier winner of two Greenaway Medals. In 2002, he named as influences Tenniel and E. H. Shepard, the first illustrator of The Wind in the Willows and Winnie the Pooh. Riddell worked as an illustrator at The Economist beginning in the 1980s and at the Observer starting in 1995. As of 2019, Riddell and his wife, Joanne Burroughes, an illustrator and print-maker, live in Brighton with three children. Daughter Katy Riddell is also a children's book illustrator, including of Pongwiffy by Kaye Umansky. His brother Rick Riddell, a secondary teacher at the Alice Smith School, died in February 2012.http://alumni.alice- smith.edu.my/files/nrteUploadFiles/232F022F2012123A103A47PM.pdf Career =The Edge Chronicles= Some of Riddell's most notable work is The Edge Chronicles (from 1998), a children's book series cowritten with Paul Stewart and illustrated by Riddell alone. Set in the fictional world known as \\"The Edge\\", the books have been praised for Chris's beautifully detailed line drawings and the unique nature of their collaborative writing process. =Other works= For his illustrations, Riddell was a commended runner-up for the 1994 Greenaway Medal (Something Else by Kathryn Cave) and highly commended for 1999 (Castle Diary by Richard Platt). He won the 2001 Medal for illustrating Pirate Diary: The Journal of Jake Carpenter by Platt. The press release called Pirate Diary the first \\"information book\\" to win the Medal since 1975 and \\"a fictionalised account\\". \\"when he spoke with author Richard Platt the harsh necessities of historical accuracy came into play. 'Everything I got excited about got shot down. No parrots, eye-patches or wooden legs. Thank god there were weapons and amputations!'\\" (quoting Riddell). (After Castle Diary and Pirate Diary, Platt continued the Diary series with illustrator David Parkins.) Three years later, Riddell won the Greenaway again, this time for his work on Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver\\" (Walker, 2004), retold by Martin Jenkins from the 1726 classic Gulliver's Travels. The panel chair commented, \\"Gulliver is a tour de force. Chris Riddell has given us 144 pages of fantastic, faultless illustrations, which constantly extend the power of the text. Our winning title also proves that today's picture books are not just for the youngest age-groups, but are [also] an important source of pleasure and learning for readers of all ages.\\" (The 2001 and 2004 panels recommended Pirate Diary and Gulliver for readers age 8+ and 10+, while their recommendations for thirteen other shortlisted books ranged from 2+ to 7+.) Other books illustrated by Chris Riddell include Fergus Crane, Corby Flood, and Hugo Pepper, all set in the same world. These books were also co-written with Paul Stewart. Stewart and Riddell also collaborated with him on Muddle Earth and the Barnaby Grimes series. Most recently, Riddell has both written and illustrated the Ottoline series, written while he was on holiday visiting his brother in Malaysia. The first book, Ottoline and the Yellow Cat (2007), won the final Smarties Prize in age category 6‚Äì8 years (the Smarties were discontinued in 2008). It has been followed by Ottoline Goes to School and Ottoline at Sea. Beside writing and illustrating books, Riddell is an acclaimed political cartoonist for the Observer newspaper in London, where his caricatures of politicians from John Major to Gordon Brown, Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, have earned him a reputation as a fine draughtsman and acute commentator on the political scene. Before working at the Observer, Chris spent time working at the Economist as an illustrator and occasional cover artist. Chris Riddell is the cover artist for the Literary Review magazine formerly edited by Auberon Waugh, a role he took over from the late Willie Rushton. Chris's serial gag cartoon for this magazine, called \\"Illustration to Unwritten Books\\", was published in book form as The Da Vinci Cod and Other Illustrations to Unwritten Books. In November 2017, Riddell publicly accused department store chain John Lewis of plagiarizing elements of his 1986 picture book Mr Underbed for their Christmas advert \\"Moz the Monster\\". The chain defended the allegations, noting that the concept of a monster who lived under a child's bed was a common literary trope, and that both works had dissimilar plots.

Biography Penco received his Ph.D. in Philosophy Summa cum Laude at the University of Genoa in 1972 with a specialization in the philosophy of science (at the time in Italy there were no PhD; he became a member of the PhD program later as a teacher). He studied with Evandro Agazzi in Genoa, with Michael Dummett in Oxford, and later with Robert Brandom at the University of Pittsburgh. He has received various academic awards and fellowships including: CNR Fellow (1976), NATO Fellow at Oxford University (1979) and Fellow of the Center for Philosophy of Science in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1998). He has been President of the Italian Society for the Analytic Philosophy (2002-2004), and member of Steering Committee of the Italian Society for Logic and the Philosophy of Sciences and the European Society for Analytic Philosophy. Together with Joao Branquino and Josep Corbi, he began a series of \\"Latin Meeting in Analytic Philosophy\\", in order to foster the exchange of ideas among Analytic Philosophers in the southern countries in Europe, with connection with Latin America. He has been teaching in South of Italy (University of Lecce) between 1988 and 1991; then he went to the University of Genoa, where he is still teaching as full professor in Philosophy of Language. President of the Master in Philosophy during the period 2004-2010, he became Head of the Doctoral School in Human Science. He has been working in the Editorial or Scientific Committees for various journals, such as Epistemologia, An International Journal for Logic and Philosophy of Science, Networks, A journal for the philosophy of Artificial Intelligence and the Cognitive Sciences, European Journal of Analytic Philosophy, Theoria (A Swedish Journal for Philosophy). His early research interests has been mainly on the philosophy of the later Wittgenstein and the philosophy of Frege. He began to work on the problem of context for the Meetings \\"Modeling and Using Contexts\\" since 1999. His recent interests are more strictly linked to different topics in the Philosophy of Language and Pragmatics, mainly on the problem of the boundaries between semantics and pragmatics.

The comics were translated to French, Serbo-Croatian, Turkish, Greek, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. Their name was taken from the Italian pronunciation of the first letters of their three surnames, Pietro Sartoris of Greek descent (Turin, Italy 15 August 1926 - 27 July 1989), Dario Guzzon (Turin, Italy 4 January 1926 - 3 May 2000), and Giovanni Sinchetto (Turin, Italy 5 April 1922 - 19 January 1991).http://www.comicvine.com/essegesse/26-58114/ Some of their more famous series are Captain Miki, Il Grande Blek, Comandante Mark, Kinowa and Alan Mistero. Kinowa by EsseGesse In Turkey, three films were produced with the character Kinowa in the early 1970s. Early life Dario Guzzon and Pietro Sartoris went to similar schools and obtained their diploma as primary school teachers. Guzzon attended the Art School and then the Academy of Fine Arts. Sartoris started up his publishing activity that eventually took him to the Taurina publishing house. He met Guzzon there. Guzzon himself was already publishing some of his cartoons in the magazine Piccina. When Taurina went bankrupt, the two men had already become close friends and passed to another publishing house, Edizioni Alpe, owned by Giuseppe Caregaro, where Guzzon designed some episodes of the strip \\"Cucciolo\\", while Sartoris edited the collection Tarman with a script by Amedeo Martini. Later on, at Torelli, they met the person who would become their soul mate in so many future cartoon adventures: Giovanni Sinchetto. Sinchetto made his d√©but in the world of cartoons with the series entitled \\"Fulmine Mascherato\\" and then continued with \\"Carnera\\" published by Torelli. The first co-operation between the three young authors from Turin gave life to \\"Kinowa\\" in 1950, a cartoon built on texts by Andrea Lavezzolo and published by the Dardo press owned by Gino Casarotti. Captain Miki The first character to be drawn and dramatized by the three authors, who by that time had started to sign themselves with the acronym EsseGesse, was published on 1 July 1951: the famous Capitan Miki (Captain Miki). The protagonist of the story is a sixteen-year-old boy alone in the world, who becomes a friend of a funny drunkard called Double Rum and joins up with the Nevada Rangers. After carrying out a number of successful missions where he shows all his bravery and firmness, young Miki is promoted, in spite of his young age, to the rank of captain. Captain Miki also has his own young fianc√©e, Susy, the daughter of the fort commandant, and in addition to Double Rum - based on the classic old man of westerns (interpreted by Walter Brennan in many film versions) - he makes friends with another funny character, Doctor Salasso, graphically reminiscent of the actor Thomas Mitchell (drunken Doc, the alcoholic, in \\"Stagecoach?\\"). These two characters gave the cartoon series a vein of comic relief, to counterbalance Miki's almost excessive maturity and conscientiousness. Captain Miki by EsseGesse. In 1953 EsseGesse had the first contacts with Tea Bonelli, the then wise guide of our Publishing House, and produced the art work for the \\"Cavaliere nero\\" dramatized from texts by Giovanni Luigi Bonelli. It was an album that recounted the adventures of Frisco Smith, a policeman serving for a western railway company. Dressed in a vaguely Mexican style, the hero of this serial is a skilful gunslinger usually assisted by a young Native American called Piccolo Corvo. Il Grande Blek \\"Il Grande Blek\\" was published on 3 October 1954 by Casarotti: the story is set during the American Revolution and Blek is the leader of a group of trappers who fight against the cruel Redcoats, the symbol of colonialist oppression. Blek's faithful buddies in adventure are his stepson Roddy and the ingenious professor Occultis. It was published during 650 parts until 1967 before a dispute sets the authors to the publisher. It is Lug who would publish the whole adventures of Blek in France. First in black and white in Kiwi, then in its own name magazine, republishing its adventures in colors. Numerous covers were realized by Jean Frisano. When the original stories were exhausted, new ones were created by Carlo Cedroni or Nicola del Principe, but also in France by Jean-Yves Mitton, Andr√© Amouriq or Ciro Tota. Miki and Blek were both achieved enormous success and were created up until 1965, and would later be continued abroad with artwork by French illustrators. Il Grande Blek by EsseGesse. Alan Mistero In 1965 there appeared \\"Alan Mistero\\", whose protagonist was a sturdy fiery red-haired hero capable of the most astonishing disguises and also a very skilful gunman, flanked in his adventures by two comic foils: the sophisticated Conte and the greedy Polpetta. This series originally appeared in a collection of weekly albums published by its own creators, but failed to achieve success and the series was soon after transferred by the three Torino authors to the publishing house Araldo, owned by Sergio Bonelli, which published it in the appendix of the Collana Araldo. Comandante Mark In September 1966, Comandante Mark was finally born. Once the regular January 1990 series was finished, the reprinting of the whole series Tutto Mark was published the very next month, and starting from the summer of that same year the Specials were also published, reaching their thirteenth annual publication by the summer of 2000. Commander Mark by EsseGesse. Against the background of the American Revolutionary War, Comandante Mark is presented to the readers as a handsome, brave, sturdy and invincible young man, who nonetheless does not convey any trace of the aloofness that is often generated by a protagonist's sense of superiority over the surrounding world. Mark has just the right degree of self-confidence as a hero and he radiates a warm feeling of confidence; he has accumulated excellent experience in his field (pitched battles and uncompromising warfare against the soldiers of George III) and he uses his vast knowledge on every occasion and always succeeds. He moves together with the Ontario Wolves, a group of indomitable guerrilla fighters composed of men and women from many different places, of all ages and from all social classes, people with different histories and past lives who have joined together.http://fantasy- world.awardspace.com/comics/ After Sartoris and Sinchetto passed on in 1989 and 1991 respectively, Guzzon was the only one left capable of designing and supervising the stories of Mark and his Ontario Wolves in Special Albums; so the baton was completely handed over to the illustrator Lina Buffolente, another doyen of Italian cartoons, mainly known for her contribution to the \\"Piccolo Ranger\\" saga. The scripts were instead developed over the following years by Bonelli's new generation of authors, such Moreno Burattini and Luigi Mignacco and Michele Masiero. The passing away of Guzzon in May 2000 finally marked the end of EsseGesse. Sources External links *Esse G.

It is held every even year at the new Berlin ExpoCenter Airport near Sch√∂nefeld, Brandenburg 18 km southeast of Berlin, Germany. The most recent ILA Berlin Air Show was held in April 2018. Established in 1909, it claims to be world's oldest air show, and it is among the largest and most important aerospace trade fairs today. According to the organisers Messe Berlin GmbH, in 2012 the Berlin Air Show attracted 125,000 professional visitors and 105,000 members of the general public, with 3,600 journalists from 65 countries also attending. The format is similar to the Paris Air Show in France and the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain, the other major events in the European air show calendar. The Berlin event starts with three professional days closed to the general public, and then on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the public are allowed in. The main display sections planned for 2014 include commercial air transport, space, military aviation, helicopters and both civil and military unmanned aircraft systems, also known as UAVs. History It was first held in Frankfurt am Main in 1909, and as such can lay claim to being the oldest aviation show in the world. After the first ILA, following the idea of the aircraft constructor August Euler, numerous flying clubs combined to form the German Pilots' Association in April 1910. Shortly after, the Association of German Aircraft Makers was founded in Frankfurt/Main, establishing close ties between the ILA and the future Federal Association of the Aerospace Industry (BDLI), an organisation that exists today. Before the First World War, the ILA was held in Berlin (1912 and later on in 1928). When Germany regained air sovereignty after the Second World War, the foundations were laid in 1955 for an \\"International Show for Travel by Air\\", which in 1957 took place at Langenhagen Airport as part of the Hanover Trade Fair, the first in a run of ILA shows in Hanover that was to last over 30 years. Known initially as the German Aviation Show, the fair was increasingly attracting participants from abroad, and in 1978 the symbolic three letters ILA from 1909 were revived. In 1992, the far-reaching political and economic changes which had taken place in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall opened the way for the ILA to return to Berlin. The ILA's main display sections include commercial aviation, aerospace, military aviation and military technology, equipment and engines, and general aviation and helicopters. Location The new multi-purpose exhibition area, called Berlin ExpoCenter Airport adjacent to the BER was finished in time for ILA 2012. The main section of the grounds cover approximately 250,000 square metres. The site is situated southeast of Germany's capital city Berlin. ILA 2002 ILA 2004 ILA 2006 All previous attendance records had been broken at ILA2006. More than 250,000 visitors (2004: 201,500, +25%) were recorded at the ILA2006 between 16 and 21 May, including 115,000 trade visitors (2004: 105,000). Events on the southern section of Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld airport were dominated by the signing of sales contracts and joint venture agreements worth billions, a display featuring some 340 aircraft, many of them making their first public appearance, and the largest number of delegations and conferences ever. 1,014 exhibitors from 42 countries (2004: 987 from 42 countries) presented products, systems and processes from every area of the aerospace industry. Several thousand experts from all over Europe and from overseas attended the more than 90 accompanying conferences in search of information. Some 4,100 media representatives from 70 countries provided comprehensive coverage of the main technical themes and the attractions for the public at the ILA2006. Eurocopter Tiger of the German Army during the ILA 2006 ILA 2006 emphasised the importance of this sector for Germany in its role as a centre for the aerospace industry. Hans-Joachim Gante, Chief Executive of the BDLI, stated: \\"We have become one of the few sectors with sustainable growth in Germany, due above all to our innovative strengths.\\" This was clearly demonstrated at the ILA2006, which is acquiring an increasingly international dimension, thereby strengthening its role as one of the world's major meeting places for the industry. This was an ideal opportunity for the German aerospace industry to demonstrate that it is among the world leaders.\\" Exhibitors expressed their satisfaction with the discussions and contacts and with the business deals that were finalised at this event. \\"In particular the decision to make Russia the partner country proved highly effective. Russia was very strongly represented and was able to establish numerous contacts and business links.\\" At the close of the event Stefan Grave, Project Director for Messe Berlin GmbH, summed up: \\"The ILA2006 underlined its major importance as a European marketing platform for this sector as well as again demonstrating its many attractions for the public. Trade visitors and the general public alike were fascinated by the high-tech products on display. Unprecedented numbers of people attended to see the Airbus A380, an outstanding international flying display and the Space Hall. Many high-ranking delegations attended, especially during the three Trade Visitors‚Äô Days. In addition to the Federal Minister of Economics Michael Glos, the ILA 2006 also received visits from the Defence Minister Franz-Josef Jung, Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch√§uble, Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee, the Minister at the Chancellor's Office Dr. Thomas de Maizi√®re and the heads of the regional governments in Brandenburg and Berlin, Matthias Platzeck and Klaus Wowereit. Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, were very strongly represented: the Chief of the Armed Forces Wolfgang Schneiderhan attended the ILA 2006, as did the Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force and Army, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz and Hans-Otto Budde. A number of ministers from other countries also visited this event, accompanied by high-ranking delegations, thereby underlining the international importance of the ILA 2006. Among them were, from the partner country Russia, the Minister of Disaster Relief Sergei Schoigu, the Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, Henk Kamp, the Greek Defence Minister Evangelos Meimarakis, the French Transport Minister Dominique Perben, the Slovenian Defence Minister Karl Erjavec, the Albanian Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu and the Ukrainian Industry Minister Volodymyr Shandra. In addition 70 parliamentarians from 17 European countries were welcomed at the ILA2006. The ILA2006 was organised jointly by the association representing the German aerospace industry, Bundesverband der Deutschen Luft- und Raumfahrtindustrie (BDLI) e.V., Berlin, and by Messe Berlin GmbH. ILA 2008 ILA 2008 was held between 27 May and 1 June 2008 on the southern section of Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport, which has been designated as the future Berlin Brandenburg International Airport (BBI). Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel attended the opening ceremony and welcomed international guests, among which a special place was dedicated to Indian operators, as India was chosen as 2008 edition's partner country. Special events were planned as part of 60th Anniversary of the Berlin Airlift celebration. UK and US veterans from the cold war age Berlin airlift were invited as ILA's special guests. Other guests were the US Air Force with a B-1B Lancer, the Poland Air Force and the Slovak Air Force with MiG-29 Fulcrum, Airbus with the A380 and the Patrouille Suisse. ILA 2010 At ILA Berlin Air Show 2010 1,153 exhibitors from 47 countries presented their products and services to 235,000 visitors, of whom 125,000 were trade visitors. Around 300 aircraft were on display at the trade show.

Parnell successfully sued for libel and Pigott shot himself. Journalist Pigott was born in Ratoath, County Meath. As a young man he supported Irish nationalism and worked on the Nation and the Tablet before acting as manager of The Irishman, a newspaper founded by Denis Holland. James O'Connor later claimed Pigott embezzled funds from the paper (Holland, who had no business sense, left its affairs to Pigott) and covered his tracks by not keeping written records. Pigott also worked for the Land League, departing in 1883 after accusing its treasurer, Mr Fagan, of being unable to account for ¬£100,000 of its funds (), and for keeping inadequate records. Nothing was done about his accusation, which was publicised in the newspapers, and he turned against the League, which was allied to several Irish nationalist groups including the Irish Parliamentary Party led by Charles Stewart Parnell. The forgeries In 1879 Pigott was proprietor of three newspapers, which he soon sold to the Irish Land League, of which Charles Stewart Parnell was president. Hitherto a violent Nationalist, from 1884 Pigott began to vilify his former associates and to sell information to their political opponents. In an effort to destroy Parnell's career, Pigott produced fake letters, which purported that Parnell had supported one of the Phoenix Park murders. The Times bought Pigott's forgeries for ¬£1,780 () and published the most damning letter on 18 April 1887. Parnell immediately denounced it as \\"a villainous and barefaced forgery\\". In February 1889, the Parnell Commission vindicated him by proving that the letters were forgeries. They included misspellings (specifically ) which Pigott had written elsewhere. A libel action instituted by Parnell also vindicated him, and his parliamentary career survived the Pigott accusations. The Commission eventually produced 37 volumes in evidence, covering not just the forgeries but also the surrounding violence that followed from the Plan of Campaign. After admitting his forgeries to Henry Labouch√®re, Pigott fled to Spain, and shot himself in a Madrid hotel room. Parnell then sued The Times for libel, and the newspaper paid him ¬£5,000 () in an out-of-court settlement, as well as considerably more in legal fees. When Parnell next entered the House of Commons, he received a hero's reception from his fellow Members of Parliament.

LULUCF has been the subject of two major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Additionally, land use is of critical importance for biodiversity.Towards Sustainable Land Use: Aligning Biodiversity, Climate and Food Policies. (2020). France: OECD Publishing. Climatic impacts of land use, land-use change, and forestry Per capita greenhouse gas emissions by country including land-use change, in the year 2000 according to World Resources Institute Land-use change can be a factor in CO2 (carbon dioxide) atmospheric concentration, and is thus a contributor to global climate change. IPCC estimates that land-use change (e.g. conversion of forest into agricultural land) contributes a net 1.6 ¬± 0.8 Gt carbon per year to the atmosphere. For comparison, the major source of CO2, namely emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production, amount to 6.3 ¬± 0.6 Gt carbon per year. This decision sets out the rules that govern how Kyoto Parties with emission reduction commitments (so-called Annex 1 Parties) account for changes in carbon stocks in land use, land-use change and forestry. It is mandatory for Annex 1 Parties to account for changes in carbons stocks resulting from deforestation, reforestation and afforestation (B Article 3.3) and voluntary to account for emissions from forest management, cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation (B. Article 3.4). The land-use sector is critical to achieving the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to . The impact of land-use change on the climate is also more and more recognized by the climate modeling community. On regional or local scales, the impact of LUC can be assess by Regional climate models (RCMs). This is however difficult, particularly for variables, which are inherently noisy, such as precipitation. For this reason, it is suggested to conduct RCM ensemble simulations. Land use and biodiversity The extent, and type of land use directly affects wildlife habitat and thereby impacts local and global biodiversity. Human alteration of landscapes from natural vegetation (e.g. wilderness) to any other use can result in habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, all of which can have devastating effects on biodiversity. Land conversion is the single greatest cause of extinction of terrestrial species. An example of land conversion being a chief cause of the critically endangered status of a carnivore is the reduction in habitat for the African wild dog, Lycaon pictus.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Deforestation is also the reason for loss of a natural habitat, with large numbers of trees being cut down for residential and commercial use. Urban growth has become a problem for forests and agriculture, the expansion of structures prevents natural resources from producing in their environment. In order to prevent the loss of wildlife the forests must maintain a stable climate and the land must remain unaffected by development. Furthermore, forests can be sustained by different forest management techniques such as reforestation and preservation. Reforestation is a reactive approach designed to replant trees that were previously logged within the forest boundary in attempts to re-stabilize this ecosystem. Preservation on the other hand is a proactive idea that promotes the concept of leaving the forest as is, without using this area for its ecosystem goods and services.Lund, H. Gyde (2006). Definitions of Forest, Deforestation, Afforestation, and Reforestation. Gainesville, VA: Forest Information Services. Both of these methods to mitigate deforestation are being used throughout the world. The U.S. Forest service predicts that urban and developing terrain in the U.S. will expand by 41 percent in the year 2060. These conditions cause displacement for the wildlife and limited resources for the environment to maintain a sustainable balance.National Conference of State Legislature.\\"State Forest Carbon Incentives and Policies\\".Jocelyn Durkay and Jennifer Schultz..22 March 2016. Web.25 April 2015.http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/state- forest-carbon-incentives-and-policies.aspx Forest Modeling Traditionally, earth system modeling has been used to analyze forests for climate projections. However, in recent years there has been a shift away from this modeling towards more of mitigation and adaptation projections. These projections can give researchers a better understanding of how to what future forest management practices should be employed. Furthermore, this new approach to modeling also allows for land management practices to be analyzed in the model. Such land management practices can be: forest harvest, tree species selection, grazing, and crop harvest. These land management practices are implemented to understand their biophysical and biogeochemical effects on the forest. However, there is a major lack of available data for these practices currently, so there needs to be further monitoring and data collecting to help improve the accuracy of the models.

Skinny pigs typically have hair on their muzzles, feet, and legs, but are hairless over the remainder of their bodies. Some of them have a thin covering of fuzzy hair on their backs as well. A healthy skinny has skin that is mostly smooth, with some wrinkling around the legs and neck. The body is full with no appearance of spine or ribs. Skinnies can come in a variety of skin colors and patterns, including \\"Dutch\\", \\"Brindle\\", and \\"Himalayan\\". The term \\"skinny\\" is used for hairless guinea pigs either because it colloquially refers to the exposed skin of the animal, or because it describes their thinner appearance due to their lack of hair. The modern breed of skinny pig originated from a cross between haired guinea pigs and a hairless lab strain. The hairless strain that it is most likely related to was a spontaneous genetic mutation that was first identified at Montreal's Armand Frappier Institute in 1978, in a colony of Hartley lab guinea pigs. In 1982 they were sent to Charles River Laboratories to be bred for laboratory use and are commonly used in dermatology studies today. They are an outbred strain that has an intact thymus and standard immune system. Unique traits Close-up of a Skinny pig's face showing the small amount of hair Hairless guinea pigs are not significantly physiologically different than regular haired guinea pigs, although they need to eat more to maintain body heat. The optimal temperature range for a hairless guinea pig is , which is slightly higher than the optimal temperature range for the haired guinea pig. Their sensitive skin has very much the same appearance as human skin, but has the same needs as normal guinea pig skin. Exposed skin is vulnerable to sunburn, other injuries and fungal infections unless precautions are taken. Skinny pigs should be housed indoors, and they are usually kept with nesting materials such as a blanket or cloth bag for heat conservation. The breeding protocol for Skinny pigs require outcrossing to haired carriers at least every other generation. This is an important step in the breeding process, which makes them a poor choice for novice breeders. Skinny pigs are born nearly hairless and must maintain the same level of hair through their life. \\"Werewolf\\" is a slang term for skinny pigs with more hair than usual, extending up over the face and onto the neck and shoulders. Extremely hairy werewolf skinny pigs will have hair all the way down to their rump. Werewolves typically gain and lose fur based on hormone levels, especially hormones related to pregnancy. A pair of skinny pigs The gene causing hairlessness in skinny pigs is a recessive gene, and breeding two skinny pigs together will always result in all offspring being skinny pigs. Breeding a skinny pig to a standard haired guinea pig will result in offspring that all carry one copy of the gene, but none will express hairlessness. These offspring are generally called skinny carriers. Breeding two skinny carriers together will result in averages of 25% of offspring being skinny pigs, 50% of offspring being skinny carriers and 25% of offspring being regular haired guinea pigs that do not carry the gene. Since the chance of getting a skinny pig is low, and because it is not possible to visually tell the difference between a haired guinea pig that does carry the gene and one that does not, this method of breeding is not recommended. Haired skinny carriers remain haired their entire life and look like a normal guinea pig despite carrying the hairless gene. There is a second type of hairless guinea pig called the Baldwin guinea pig, however its hairlessness is the result of a completely different recessive gene. Breeding a skinny pig with a Baldwin guinea pig will result in offspring that all are haired and carry one copy of the gene for skinny pig hairlessness and one copy of the gene for Baldwin hairlessness. Even though the skinny is a relatively new breed among pet owners and cavy fanciers, it is gaining popularity in Canada, Europe, Scandinavia, and Russia as well as in the United States where it was introduced into the pet trade in the mid-to-late 1990s.

He partnered Muttiah Muralitharan and took 3 for 65 and 1 for 41 in a winning cause. Three first class games later he ended his cricket career.

Seuil, p. 768. 1 October 1909, Al√®s - 9 January 1988, Marnes-la- Coquette) was a French journalist, essayist, dramatist, and literary critic. He was married to theatre director Marcelle Tassencourt. Early years A graduate of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in the same class as Roger Vailland, Robert Brasillach, and Maurice Bard√®che. While still a student, Maulnier became active in the integralist Action Fran√ßaise, and published in Charles Maurras' newspaper (L'Action fran√ßaise). He made a career in journalism and took part in the movement of the Non-conformists of the 1930s, inspired by the personalist generation of young intellectuals who shared some of the ideals of the Action Fran√ßaise, holding right-wing beliefs as an answer to a \\"crisis of civilization\\" and materialism. He also campaigned against democracy and capitalism, advocating a union of the right and left to overthrow the two. Thierry Maulnier associated with youth periodicals such as R√©action, La Revue du Si√®cle, and La Revue fran√ßaise; he also wrote his first volume, La crise est dans l'homme (\\"Crisis Is in Man\\"). In 1934, he authored, with Jean-Pierre Maxence, the manifesto Demain la France (\\"Tomorrow, France\\"). Maxence and Maulnier also founded the weekly L'Insurg√© in 1936 lasting only a few months, the magazine circulated nationalist tenets, reviewed in Maulnier's 1938 essay Au-del√† du nationalisme (\\"Beyond Nationalism\\"). At the same time, he joined Jean de Fabr√®gues in the creation of a more analytical paper, Combat, one which would be published until France's defeat in World War II. World War II and after A regular contributor to L'Action fran√ßaise since 1938, Maulnier continued to publish after Nazi Germany's occupation of France (from 1940); he also started writing for Le Figaro. He ceased writing for the paper after the start of Operation Torch in 1942, and remained a journalist for Le Figaro from 1945 until his death. With the beginning of the Fourth Republic, Maulnier no longer engaged in politics. He wrote plays (La Course des rois - 1947; Le Profanateur - 1950, La Ville au fond de la mer - 1953, Le Soir du conqu√©rant - 1970) and essays (Violence et conscience - 1945, La Face de m√©duse du communisme - 1952, L'Europe a fait le monde - 1966, Le Sens des mots - 1976, Les Vaches sacr√©es - 1977), but also commented on social themes (with Maulnier as a staunch Pro-European). In 1964, he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in place of the deceased Henry Bordeaux. In 1986 he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.

It is now a conference centre. Location Since the demise of Easthampstead parish, the house has been located in the western extremes of Bracknell parish, between the Southern Industrial Estate and Wokingham. It is surrounded by a estate, which, in 1786, had extended to 5,000 acres (20 km2). Some of this land is now taken up by the Downshire Golf Course. Architecture Back of house and gardens The front of the house in 1936 Easthampstead Park is listed by the Department for the Environment as \\"a building of historic and architectural interest, in Jacobean style with curved gables, pierced stone parapet and stone frontispiece of naive classicism\\". It was erected in 1864. The pitched roof and the cupolas above the towers were lost sometime between 1936 and present, perhaps following the 1949 fire. History =Royal lodge= In the Middle Ages, Easthampstead was a part of Windsor Forest, and was reserved for royal hunting. King Edward III had a hunting lodge at Easthampstead, an easy ride from Windsor, which he had built in 1350. Henry VII and his son Arthur, Prince of Wales arranged the latter's marriage to Catherine of Aragon at the lodge, and later rode out from here for their first meeting with the princess on Finchampstead Ridges. After the death of his brother in 1502, Henry VIII married Catherine as his first wife, and years later, she spent a miserable few years at Easthampstead Park, awaiting news of her husband's attempt to divorce her when his attentions turned to Anne Boleyn. Sir John Mason (1503-1566) became Keeper of Easthampstead Park in 1548 and King James I enlarged and improved the estate, which was well stocked with deer. =Trumbull home= Charles I gave the Park to William Trumbull on 28 March 1629, in recognition of his service as ambassador to the Archduke Albert of Austria, Regent of the Netherlands, and later as Clerk of the Privy Council, on the condition that he maintain a herd of 200 deer for the King's recreation in the deer park. The royal hunting lodge was incorporated into a newly built mansion. William Trumbull died in September 1635 and is buried in Easthampstead parish church. William Trumbull (2nd) lived from 1594 to 1668. In 1636, Charles I issued a charter to give Easthampstead Park to the Trumbulls permanently, confirming the gift of 1628. The charter had long been lost, but was recently discovered in London.Berkshire Record Office Newsletter, Issue 31, Spring 2005. It was subsequently purchased by Berkshire Record Office with support from the MLA/Victoria and Albert Museum Purchase Grant Fund. Sir William Trumbull (3rd) (1639‚Äì1716) was the most distinguished of the family, active in the Royal service overseas. He was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford and a barrister. Sir William Trumbull befriended Alexander Pope the poet, who lived in Binfield and was a frequent visitor to Easthampstead Park. Another poet, Elijah Fenton, was tutor to William Trumbull (4th) (1708‚Äì1760). His only child, Mary Trumbull, married Martin Sandys in 1760. Their only child, Mary Sandys (1764‚Äì1836), married Arthur Hill, 2nd Marquess of Downshire (1753‚Äì1801) in 1786 and was later created Baroness Sandys. Trumbull manuscripts The Trumbull inheritance included 380 volumes of manuscripts collected by Sir William Trumbull (3rd). The archive, which features letters by Stuart kings, Philip II of Spain, Marie de Medici, Bacon, Donne, Dryden, Fenton, Pope and Weckherlin, had been on loan to Berkshire county record office. In the summer of 1989, the collection was sent to Sotheby's in London, with an estimate of ¬£2.5m. But on the eve of the November sale, a deal was done with the Inland Revenue, the auction was cancelled and the British Library took the papers. =Marquess' estate= Arthur Hill succeeded as 2nd Marquess of Downshire on the death of his father Wills Hill in 1793, who started the building of Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, completed in 1797. They had five sons: *Arthur Blundell Sandys Trumbull Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire (1788‚Äì1845) *Arthur Moyses William Hill, 2nd Baron Sandys (1793‚Äì1860) *Arthur Marcus Cecil Sandys, 3rd Baron Sandys (1798‚Äì1863) *Arthur Augustus Edwin Sandys (1800‚Äì1831) *Major Lord George Augusta Sandys (1801‚Äì1879) In a letter in May 1857, to a Mrs Russell of Thornhill, Jane Carlyle (wife of Thomas Carlyle), whose friend Lady Ashburton had recently died and who was suffering from influenza, wrote: \\"In the meantime I am going for a week to Easthampstead Park (the Marquis of Downshire's), almost immediately. But these great grand Country Houses are not the places Nature prompts me to take my sick nerves and bad spirits to! Especially when I am not going as a sort of animated, still wholly irresponsible carpet-bag, with Mr. Carlyle's name on it, but on my own basis! ...\\" New Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle (London and New York: John Lane, The Bodley Head, 1893) ed. Alexander Carlyle. Easthampstead house was only one of the properties of the Marquess of Downshire, who owned large estates of 115,000 acres (465 km2) in Northern Ireland. In 1860, the fourth Marquess, confusingly called Arthur Wills Blundell Sandys Trumbull Windsor Hill (1812‚Äì1868) demolished the old mansion, leaving only a stable block, and built the present house which was completed in 1864. At about the same time as the present mansion was erected, the Marchioness provided for the rebuilding of St Michael's parish church, Easthampstead where there are memorials to the Trumbull and Downshire families and to the poet, Elijah Fenton. In 1885, King Edward VII visited Easthampstead Park while Prince of Wales. One of his handwritten letters, dated from the Park 18 June 1885, has been offered for sale by Heritage Auction Galleries of Dallas, Texas . The Downshires were very active in the affairs of Ireland, but Arthur Hill, 6th Marquess of Downshire (1871‚Äì1918) lived principally at Easthampstead Park until his death. These were the golden days of Easthampstead Park, especially during Royal Ascot week each year. The sixth Marquess and his son employed a large staff of gardeners and others, and took great personal interest in the estate, even assisting with the upkeep of the roads with their own steam roller. The Park also contained a miniature steam railway, since removed to a south coast resort. The old engine shed still survives near the original ha-ha at the edge of the current gardens however. The gardens are well stocked with a large number of mature trees of diverse and often exotic species. During the Second World War, part of the Mansion was used by St Paul's School, which was evacuated from London. Until 1945, masters and boys lived in Crowthorne, lessons took place in Easthampstead Park, while Wellington College lent playing fields and laboratories. The Army made use of the Park and built many Nissen huts. The Army's presence attracted German aircraft in 1941 which dropped a stick of bombs down the main drive, the last one hitting the Lodge at the main gate. College and school After the War, Easthampstead Park was sold to Berkshire County Council. After repairs following a fire in 1949, a training college for women teachers was opened, the mansion was altered and extended, and a new gymnasium and study block, now known as the Whitfield building was erected. Tennis courts were built or renovated, but one at the edge of the park is derelict. A Christmas Party in the well of the main staircase was held every year during the life of the college. There was a library situated behind the main hall, and the students developed their own garden near to one of the tennis courts. During the period, the gardens contained a vegetable garden near to the present school. Dances were organised regularly in the main hall. In 1968, Easthampstead Park College was amalgamated with Bulmershe College to form the Berkshire College of Education. The last students training to teach were withdrawn from Easthampstead Park in 1972, when an Educational Centre was opened, initially comprising an adult residential college and Easthampstead Park School. In 1984 SEBEV Search and Rescue moved into the basement area of the mansion which was already being used as a government nuclear fallout shelter. SEBEV SAR is still there to this day. In 1995, Easthampstead Park School relocated to a new location nearby and the mansion is now used as Easthampstead Park Conference Centre and Bracknell Forest Education Centre. Inside the mansion, rooms are named after the Trumbull, Sandys, Hill and Downshire families and their estates, and former staff of the college such as Wylie and Lewis. Coincidentally, the school's first Headteacher, Derrick Hurd had previously been the first Head of John Mason School in Abingdon, named after the Oxfordshire spy and diplomat who, in the 16th Century had been keeper of the Easthampstead Park estate.

Stevens was established in Maidstone in 1897 by William Arthur Stevens and had by 1906 built its first petrol-electric vehicle using designs patented by Percival (Percy) Frost- Smith. A petrol engine was connected to an electrical generator and the current produced passed to a traction motor which drove the rear wheels. W.A. Stevens also patented a system for converting conventional petrol buses for either battery-electric or petrol-electric propulsion, patent GB190820210. Percy Frost-Smith Percival Harry Frost-Smith was Managing Director of Tilling-Stevens Ltd in 1915/1916 and he obtained several patents for improvements to motor vehicles between 1908 and 1918. These included: * With William Arthur Stevens, Worm drive for vehicles * With Francis Edwin Brown, Improvements in and relating to Worm Drive for Mechanically Propelled Vehicles * With Victor Snow Robinson, Improvements in and connected with the Electric Lighting of Vehicles * With Tilling-Stevens Ltd, Improved Means of Control for Petrol Electric Vehicles Francis Edwin Brown was a son of David Brown, of David Brown Ltd.  Buses  Thames Valley bus delivered 1927 =Hallford- Stevens and Dennis-Stevens= The petrol-electric transmission was fitted to chassis built by J & E Hall, of Dartford who used the trade name \\"Hallford\\" so these were known as \\"Hallford-Stevens\\". Transmissions were also supplied to Dennis Bros, of Guildford these vehicles were named \\"Dennis-Stevens\\". =Tilling-Stevens= Share of the S.G. de Autobuses de Madrid, issued 14. September 1922; it shows a petrol-electric Tilling-Stevens bus An arrangement was agreed with a large bus operator, Thomas Tilling, who wanted to produce their own vehicles named Tilling-Stevens. The ease of driving and soundness of construction of these vehicles soon led to the company supplying chassis to many bus operators in the UK, and several abroad as well. According to the website of the Transport Museum Wythall the simpler to operate petrol-electric transmission was popular among bus drivers rather than the conventional crash gearbox (in the days before synchromesh) as few bus staff had previously driven motor vehicles. Tilling-Stevens Motors Ltd was obliged to consolidate its position with bus operators during World War I because the Army considered their petrol-electric chassis were not suitable for use in France. The low- mounted electrical items were considered vulnerable. Many men were trained to drive during the War on vehicles with conventional gearboxes and developments in gearbox design made their vehicles quieter, more reliable and lighter, resulting in better economy. All this combined to lead to a decline in popularity of the Tilling-Stevens' and other Petrol Electric systems. By the 1930s, TS chassis were being produced with conventional petrol/diesel engines, gearboxes and transmission. Tilling-Stevens split from Thomas Tilling in 1930 and renamed itself T S Motors Ltd (TSM) in 1932, but were again renamed Tilling-Stevens in 1937, before World War II had broken out. Tilling-Stevens was still manufacturing buses after World War II, with a large order built in 1947/1948 for export to Hong Kong (China Motor Bus (108) & Kowloon Motor Bus (50)). Trolleybuses Tilling-Stevens also produced trolleybuses. An existing customer in respect of petrol-electric buses, Wolverhampton Corporation, decided to replace trams with trolleybuses on one route of their Corporation Tramway and asked Tilling to supply them. The result was an adapted version of the hybrid TS6 model with electrical components by BTH of Bath, Somerset, and body by Dodson. The first six entered service in 1923. Further orders followed from Halifax Corporation and in 1924 the general manager of the Teesside Railless Traction Board designed a trolleybus chassis which was built by Tilling-Stevens. This chassis (designated PERC1) could use a petrol engine to drive the dynamo and power the traction motor as well as being able to take overhead power. The company subsequently purchased the rights to the Teesside design after receiving enquiries from abroad but domestic production ceased after 1927. Following the initial split from Thomas Tilling, the company produced one further new chassis which was exhibited at the 1930 Scottish Motor Show. Only one sale was made, to Turin, Italy. Goods vehicles  1914 TSB3 tipper petrol-electric searchlight lorry Tilling-Stevens also produced goods chassis available with either petrol-electric or conventional gearbox transmissions and built many trucks during World War I. Their cast aluminium radiators were distinctive, with \\"Tilling-Stevens\\" cast into the top and either \\"Petrol-Electric\\" or \\"Maidstone\\" into the bottom tanks. After the war, they failed to invest in updating their products and ended up building mainly buses. Tilling-Stevens therefore acquired Vulcan Trucks of Southport, Lancashire in 1938 to extend their range (and use Vulcan petrol engines). Production stayed at Maidstone, and Vulcan's production was also relocated there. The unusual electric transmission became less of an advantage as other makers developed their simpler mechanical transmissions to be reliable and easier to drive. Tilling-Stevens specialised in some unusual markets where the transmission could offer a particular advantage, by also using it as a generator. Some early turntable ladder fire engines were produced where arc lamps for lighting and the electric motors to raise the ladder could be powered by it. In the 1930s the lorries also lost the large cast radiators in favour of first a thinner cast aluminium shell and then a cheaper steel pressed bonnet and a small diamond-shaped \\"TSM\\" badge. Leading up to World War II they specialised in the searchlight trucks for which they are probably still best known today.  Rootes Group  Perkins diesel engine. On show at Bromyard, England in 2008 In 1950, the company was sold to Rootes Group. Complete vehicle production ceased in 1953, as Rootes' own truck brands had developed heavier trucks themselves. The plant continued to produce light commercial engines (particularly the iconic Commer TS3 two-stroke diesel, which had been intended for introduction by Tilling-Stevens in 1954) and vehicle bodies, before finally closing in the 1970s, some years after the group had been acquired by Chrysler. Factory Tilling-Stevens factory was situated in St Peter's St, Maidstone. The factory buildings, built in the 1920s in the Daylight style, survive as of 2012. They were Listed as Grade II in July 2011. It is described as \\"one few buildings of this style not to have undergone significant alteration from the original\\".  Petrol Electric engines and their Legacy  The Tilling-Stevens petrol-electric bus is interesting as an early example of a hybrid vehicle, although without any direct engine propulsion or battery storage. {generator 1923 |traction motor 1923 |back axle 1923 |} As the petrol engine ran continuously and its chassis weight with a large, heavy motor/dynamo pair was much higher than a mechanical gearbox, it was less fuel efficient than a competing mechanical transmission chassis type. Once mechanical gearbox transmissions were developed enough to become reliable, quiet and easy enough to use, this inefficiency contributed to its demise. Another reason was the simple and fairly inefficient electrical control system, the best that could be achieved in the absence of \\"modern\\" electronics. However hybrid petrol-electric cars, such as the Toyota Prius, are now seen as being a partial solution towards cutting carbon dioxide emissions and reducing the risks of damaging global warming. Many Tilling Stevens Petrol Electric vehicles ended their days as mobile caravans or lorries with travelling fairs and showground people, where the electrical generation could be useful for other things than merely to move the vehicle. Some chassis survived beyond being direct road transport to become generator trailers for these fairs. This helped maintain a stock of dynamo and motor units and even chassis, making restorations possible.  Driving a Petrol-Electric  New Chassis from 1914 with Secondhand pre 1908 body by Newman of London as first combined in 1914. With the electrical generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently connected to the petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return throttle pedal (with a hand-operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc.) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position changeover switch to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high current wire wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give the electrical effect of gearing. It was very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance \\"gear\\" lever is then set to max torque, and then the direction lever set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the throttle pedal a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the throttle pedal is released, the resistance lever is brought back to \\"slow speed\\", the brake applied and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and handbrake applied. There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only. Apart from the Throttle, engine management controls were usually only a Choke lever and Ignition Advance/Retard for starting the hand cranked engine. On magneto ignition models there would be a simple switch to short the magneto and so stop the engine running.Southdown Omnibus Trust, Amberley Museum, West Sussex, England See also * Leyland L60  References  Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Defunct bus manufacturers of the United Kingdom Defunct truck manufacturers of the United Kingdom Rootes Group Defunct companies based in Kent British companies established in 1897 Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1897 Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1950 1897 establishments in England 1950 disestablishments in England British companies disestablished in 1950 ","title":"Tilling-Stevens"},{"id":"4024767","text":"In 1992, The Wedding Present decided to release a limited edition single every month, each featuring an original track on the A side and a cover on the B side.

A former member of the UK Green Party, he co-founded the Global Commons Institute in 1990. Life Aubrey Meyer was born in Yorkshire in 1947. He was raised in Cape Town, South Africa from 1952. In 1968 he gained a Bachelor of Music from the Music College, Cape Town University. He won Southern African Music Rights Organisation (SAMRO) scholarship for two years study abroad. From 1969 to 1971 he studied at the Royal College of Music in London. There he studied composition with Phillip Cannon and viola with the late Cecil Aronowitz. He won the International Music Company Prize and the Stanton Jeffries Music Prize. After the Royal College, he earned his living playing viola in orchestras: - principal viola in Scottish Theatre Ballet (1971),Scottish Ballet Ulster (1972), Gulbenkian Orchestra, CAPAB OrchestraCAPAB and as a rank-and-file player in the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet and finally in the London Philharmonic Orchestra. He has lived in London since 1980. During this period he continued composing. His one-act ballet 'Exequy' led to the award of a Master of Music degree in composition from the University of Cape Town. In 1980, Meyer returned to London, combining composition with playing and his ballet score Choros for the Sadlers Wells Royal Ballet for the ballet by David Bintley, won an Evening Standard Award (1984); reviews for Exequy & Choros. In 1988, while looking for a theme for a new composition, he heard about the environmentalist Chico Mendez who had been assassinated for his work in trying to prevent the destruction of the Brazilian rainforest, and he abandoned music for the UK Green Party of England and Wales. He co-founded the Global Commons Institute (GCI) in 1990 to start a programme to counter the threat of climate change based on the founding premise of 'Equity and Survival'. At the request of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1992, Meyer conceived and presented his analysis of 'The Unequal Use of the Global Commons' to Working Group Three of the IPCC Second Assessment Report. This was dubbed 'Expansion and Divergence' and, led to an international rejection, at the UN climate negotiations in 1995, of the global cost benefit analysis of climate change by some economists from the US and UK. Contraction and Convergence This led to the development of GCI's framework of Contraction & Convergence (C&C;). Introduced at the UNFCCC in 1996, C&C;'s approach to stabilizing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 'safe' level (by shrinking and sharing the limited and finite weight of such gases that future human activity can release into the atmosphere on an equal per capita basis) raises a key issue in the climate change debate. As a musician and string player, Meyer says the world must collaborate with musical discipline to avert runaway climate change: i.e. play C&C;'s 'carbon reduction score' in time, in tune and together. C&C; was introduced to the UNFCCC at COP-2 Geneva: C&C; became this iconic image in the months that followed. C&C; was on the agenda at COP-3 Kyoto. C&C; was on the agenda at COP-4 Buenos Aires when host Government published this in their conference newspaper. C&C; was on the Agenda at COP-6 The Hague with Chairman Jan Pronk advocating it. C&C; was on the agenda for COP-15 at Copenhagen, but was not agreed. C&C; now considered by some as \\"the most preferable equity framework\\". C&C; considered by others as \\"the best possible solution to the twin problems of climate change and inequity\\". Meyer has now enclosed C&C; in the 'Carbon Budget Accounting Tool' (CBAT online) (CBAT notes) (CBAT appreciation) Comments by third parties \\"Some proposals compensate the potential burden on developing nations with generous emissions allocation, whether as a simple strategy to obtain developing countries support for the regime or in a realisation of the global equity principle borrowed from social justice. A famous such proposal is 'Contraction and Convergence' developed by Aubrey Meyer.\\" Act Locally Trade Globally; Emissions Trading for Climate Policy Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development IEA \\"I think Aubrey is a good gentleman. He has really been on this issue for years, for donkey‚Äôs years and he‚Äôs not giving up and he has the stamina. I think if we were all of us like Aubrey we would have achieved very high levels. Unfortunately not many of us have been that strong\\". Joshua Wairoto, Deputy Director Kenya Met Office speaking at the UN Climate Negotiations in 2007. \\"I think that Aubrey Meyer has done an amazing job and has shown extraordinary persistence and ingenuity in working out a scheme of this kind and I very much admire him for it. Above all he has laid out a kind of intellectual and legal framework which is what we need if we are going to set global arrangements in place and these global arrangements should I believe be fully reflected in the Bill that is now before the UK Parliament to regulate climate change. This is not the time for half-measures or quarter measures or fiddling with the problem. It is important to lay out the principles and then see how they should best be interpreted to give effect to a common human problem\\". Sir Crispin Tickell, former British Ambassador, Director of the Policy Foresight Programme James Martin 21st Century School Oxford University. \\"It seems to me that Contraction and Convergence is the basic principle that should guide climate policy, and that this policy is really unchallenged in principle by any of the climate models under discussion. Granted that it is good to have accurate models of how the world works, and to work out the numerical balances of C&C.; Nevertheless, I wonder at what point complex and uncertain empirical models become a distraction from simple first principles? C&C; is a necessary condition for a just and sustainable world. With best wishes & admiration for your important work on C&C.;\\"'' Herman Daly, Emeritus Professor, University of Maryland On 4 February 2009, Lord Adair Turner (chair, UK Climate Change Committee) confirmed to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee that, \\"it‚Äôs very difficult to imagine a long-term path for the world that is not somewhat related to a contract and converge type approach....we have made a very clear statement that we cannot imagine a global deal that is both do- able and fair, which doesn‚Äôt end up by mid century with roughly equal rights per capita to emit, and that is clearly said in the report\\". On 24 June 2009, Rajendra Pachauri, (Chairman of the IPCC) said the following ‚Äú When one looks at the kinds of reductions that would be required globally, the only means for doing so is to ensure that there‚Äôs contraction and convergence, and I think there‚Äôs growing acceptance of this reality. I don‚Äôt see how else we might be able to fit within the overall budget for emissions for the world as a whole by 2050. We need to start putting this principle into practice as early as possible, so that by the time we reach 2050, we‚Äôre not caught by surprise, we‚Äôre well on a track for every country in the world that would get us there... On the matter of 'historic responsibility', there is no doubt that accelerating the rate of convergence relative to the rate of contraction is a way of answering that we really need to get agreement from Developed and Developing Countries to subscribe to this principle\\". C&C; is the most widely cited and arguably the most widely supported proposal for UNFCCC-compliance in play and many people believe C&C; will yet prove to be the overarching principle that is adopted and that allows all nations to find common ground on how to achieve 'climate truth and reconciliation' and avert climate chaos. Awards Meyer's environmental efforts have led to many awards. He is the recipient of the Andrew Lees Memorial Prize, 1998; Schumacher Award, 2000; Findhorn Fellowship, 2004; Eurosolar Award 2006; City of London, Life-time's Achievement Award, 2005; Honorary Fellow of Royal Institute of British Architects, 2007; UNEP FI Global Roundtable Financial Leadership Award, 2007. and in 2008 a cross party group of British MPs nominated Meyer for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.

For a detailed chronology see \\"Global Debate: Dialogue of Civilizations\\". History One of the first places for where Dialogue Among Civilizations took place was in Isfahan, Iran at the Safa Khaneh Community that was established in 1902. Safa Khaneh was a place that Haj Aqa Nourollah and his older brother made. It was a place where Muslims and Christians talked about their religions with each other. It was one of the first interfaith centers in the world. Later a magazine was published based on the dialogues between Muslims and Christians in the Safa Khaneh and it was released in Iran, India and England. The founder of Safa Khaneh, Haj Aqa Nouroollah was one of the leaders of the Constitution Era in Iran. His house has become a museum named Constitution house of Isfahan. Introduction The page dedicated to the United Nations Year of Dialog Among Civilizations introduces the idea as follows: The Vision Here are some excerpts from the vision of the Foundation for Dialogue among Civilizations: The Mission Here are some excerpts from the mission of the Foundation for Dialogue among Civilizations: Contrasting view: The Clash of Civilizations In 1993, Huntington provoked great debate among international relations theorists with the interrogatively-titled \\"The Clash of Civilizations?\\", a controversial, oft-cited article published in Foreign Affairs magazine. Its description of post‚ÄìCold War geopolitics contrasted with the controversial End of History thesis advocated by Francis Fukuyama. Huntington expanded \\"The Clash of Civilizations?\\" to book length and published it as The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order in 1996. The article and the book posit that post‚ÄìCold War conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences. That, whilst in the Cold War, conflict likely occurred between the Capitalist West and the Communist Bloc East, it now was most likely to occur between the world's major civilizations ‚Äî identifying seven, and a possible eighth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox, (vii) Japanese, and (viii) the African. This cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states. To understand current and future conflict, cultural rifts must be understood, and culture ‚Äî rather than the State ‚Äî mern(?) nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions. Critics (for example, in Le Monde Diplomatique) called The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order the theoretical legitimization of American-led Western aggression against China and the world's Islamic cultures. Nevertheless, this post‚ÄìCold War shift in geopolitical organization and structure requires that the West internally strengthens itself culturally, by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic universalism and its incessant military interventionism. Other critics argued that Huntington's taxonomy is simplistic and arbitrary, and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations. Huntington's influence upon U.S. policy has been likened to that of British historian A.J. Toynbee's controversial religious theories about Asian leaders in the early twentieth century. Personal Representative of the Secretary-General for the UN Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations has said: Mr. Picco was appointed the Personal Representative to the Secretary- General for the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations in 1999 in order to facilitate discussions on diversity, through organizing conferences, seminars and disseminating information and scholarly materials. Having served the United Nations for two decades, Mr. Picco is most recognized for participating in UN efforts to negotiate the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and in bringing an end to the Iran-Iraq war. He believes that people should take responsibility for who they are, what they do, what they value, and what they believe in.

The story revolves around the incidents following the death of a young Naxalite, upon whose death his friends travel to the village where his mother lives to inform her of the death of her only son. Amma Ariyan is considered to be a complex movie. Since its release in 1986, critics have read several layers of meaning in its story.

Plot Preparing to leave for Delhi, Purushan bids his mother goodbye, promising to write to her regularly. In the thinly populated forest area of Wayanad in the north- east of Kerala, the jeep in which he is travelling is stopped by the Police, who take possession of it to carry a dead body found hanging on the wayside tree. The dead man's face looks familiar to Purushan. He becomes restless and is seized with a pathological obsession to find out the identity of the deceased. Against the wishes of his girl friend, he abandons his trip to Delhi and sets out to seek his friends who may have some clue. Purushan meets journalist friends, doctors, and finally a veteran comrade, fondly addressed as Balettan who identifies the dead as the fellow musician who accompanied Satyajit, the guitarist. Satyajit confirms the deceased is his friend Hari, the tabla player. Together they decide to inform Hari's mother who stays in Cochin. They set out on a long eventful journey from the northern highlands of Wayanad to the Southern port city of Cochin. As they move from Kozhikode to Beypore, Kodungalloor, Thrissur, Kottapuram, Vypin, and finally to Fort Kochi, the group swells as they meet many mothers and their sons and relatives who have known Hari; some had known him as a tabla player, some as Tony, the jazz drummer and others as a silent political activist, a victim of police brutality, and a loner. And for others he was a drug addict and one who used to drown his sorrow and pain in his music. Through their recollections, Hari's rather diffused identity unfolds. His classmates remember Hari as an introvert, weak and indecisive. His worker comrades identify him as a staunch revolutionary with a strong resistance and will power. But then what went wrong? The colonial past of the places, what they took from us and what they left behind as well as the peoples protests and uprisings, the region witnesses and their heroes and victims are integrated into the narrative, by way of information as well as critiquing. While reporting to his mother about Hari and his friends and their mothers on his southbound journey, John also reconstructs the history of the land through a series of class struggles, student protests, and workers union clashes that took place in the region where Purushan traversed. Starting with the medical students agitation against commercialization of medical education, to a short dialogue with Karuppuswamy, the unfortunate victim who had lost both his legs in a colliery workers struggle for better wages and human dignity, in Kottapuram, to Vypin island where several mazdoors (labourers) either died or lost their eyesight in the man-made hooch tragedy, to the Citizens group's forcible taking over of rice and sugar hoarded by unscrupulous black marketer traders and distributing to ordinary people at fair prices and giving back the money collected to the traders, to the manipulated fight between workers of two feuding unions in a Mattancherry street in Fort Kochi, where four fishermen had died, and also some targeted working class leaders in a fake Police encounter, an abortive factory workers strike extending solidarity to the retrenched women workers in Fort Kochi, are some of the long list of peoples protests and struggles reported with deep concern and feeling by Purushan in a long letter to his Mother. As Purushan and his group wait for Hari's mother to come out of the Baptism ceremony from the church, they analyse their own past, note the emerging debate focusing on the romantic evasions and tragic failures of the extremist movement. When Hari s mother finally turns up and faces the youth congregation, she asks \\"Suicide wasn't it?\\" The film ends with Purushan's mother watching Hari's mother wiping her tear. Cast *Kunhulakshmi Amma as Purushan's mother *Harinarayan as Hari *Joy Mathew as Purushan *Maji Venkitesh as Paru *Nilambur Balan Production The incidents that led to the production of Amma Ariyan are striking. A group of young friends of John Abraham who wanted to make it into a \\"people's movie\\", constituted the Odessa Collective, aiming at production and exhibition of good cinema with active participation of the general public, without the intervention of market forces. They raised money for the film by traveling from village to village and house to house, beating drums, singing and putting up skits and short plays at street corners and asking for contributions for the 'people's cinema'. They collected the fund needed for the production of a movie. It was Odessa's first film and John's last Amma Ariyan re-wrote all the conventions of filmmaking.Rajan Kurai Krishnan 2011.

Kerala Modernity: Ideas, Spaces and Practices in Transition. Hyderabad: Orient Blackswan, pp. 109-125. The film is made in a documentary style. As a part of the technique of intertwining fact and fiction, the film maker shot many actual leftist political strikes that took place in Kerala during that time. Themes ;The Great Mother not one but many As in all primitive cultures which have the power to overcome contradictions of faith, in Kerala too radicalism has gone hand in hand with the mother cult. The mother goddess is worshipped in its varied forms ‚Äì as Devi, Bhagavathi, Parvathi, and Kali all alternate forms of Durga, the consort of Lord Shiva and the embodiment of energy and destruction. The traditional matrilineal kinship, sensitively shown in the scene between the mother and the son's betrothed drying the wet cloth in the sun, in a way points to the strong influence Purushan ( also means The Man ) has in defining his personal radicalism. The male (Purushan) seeking an umbilical solace in the female (Nature) through the expression of his inner self thereby becomes the crux of John's narrative. \\"Suicide is something that John tries to come to grips with as the little boy asks: \\"Father, what's suicide?\\" And Purushan clumsily tries to explain but fails ¬¶. Two mothers in the film - one Hindu and the other Muslim - ask themselves and us, \\"Why these youngsters are committing suicides? \\", As we look at their faces, we realize John is not telling the story of one mother and one son but of several mothers and several sons and also the tragedy of a time in Kerala's socio-political and cultural history. As with Ghatak, for John also the mother image is the most vibrant cohesive force in Nature which binds people of different sensitivity together. His protagonist s journey begins and ends with the same belief. ;Alone in the crowd As the journey proceeds and Purushan takes stock of his life and goes into reflections of his umbilical links with his mother and the beloved as they always appear together as a single entity in his mind, he finds himself more and more alienated from the group and their ideology, (if they have one). The alienation becomes complete towards the fag end of the film with an arresting image of him lying alone in bed of flowers under a tree and the camera captures his face in a way that reminds us of the dead face of Hari in the mortuary His total identification with Hari takes him to come to terms with himself and both the mothers ¬¶. ;The Journey The whole film is designed in the form of a \\"journey\\" ‚Äì the journey of life Putrushan sets out for the journey with the intention of going North (Delhi), but after his encounter with \\"death\\"¬ù he reverses the direction and travels South from the forests of Vayanad in North Kerala to Fort Kochi, the port city, traversing practically the whole of Malabar, a land which had a long tradition of political activity and people's movements in Kerala. Even though John came from further down, Kottayam, he seemed to have a thorough grasp of the political and cultural history of this region. The film is an eloquent testimony to this. ;History of class struggles While reporting to his mother about Hari and his friends and their mothers on his southbound journey, John also reconstructs the history of the land through a series of class struggles, student protests, and workers union clashes that took place in the region where Purushan traversed. Starting with the medical students' agitation against commercialization of medical education (a topical issue to this day), to a short dialogue with Karuppuswamy, the unfortunate victim who had lost both his legs in a colliery workers struggle for better wages and human dignity, in Kottapuram, to Vypin island where several mazdoors (labourers) either died or lost their eyesight in the man made hooch tragedy, to the citizens group's forcible taking over of rice and sugar hoarded by unscrupulous black marketer traders and distributing to ordinary people at fair prices and giving back the money collected to the traders, to the manipulated fight between workers of two feuding unions in a Mattancherry street in Fort Kochi. Where four fishermen had died, and also some targeted working class leaders in a fake Police encounter, an abortive factory workers strike extending solidarity to the retrenched women workers in Fort Kochi ¬¶ are some of the long list of peoples protests and struggles reported with deep concern and feeling by Purushan in a long letter to his Mother ¬¶ ;Interpreting metaphors The metaphors used by John in Amma Ariyan are powerful, but often obscure. The dead body, which Purushan witnessed by chance and later, brings together like-minded people to form a crowd requires to be interpreted. The other and perhaps the most important metaphor that needs interpretation is 'Mother'. Even though throughout the course of the film, each individual member joins the crowd after informing their respective mothers, two mothers stand out in the film. The film unfurls in the form of a letter to Purushan's mother who sees off her son by urging him to write letter to her, wherever he may be. The other mother, the mother of Hari who commits suicide is the destination of the crowd. While one among them is anxious to know about her son's journey through the torrid times, the other mother foresees her son's suicide, while almost all the mothers are seen worried about the youth of that time, succumbing into suicide. John's film starts with a mother's wish to know about her son and ends where another mother's dreams of her son burn down. The crowd that is formed for the mission of informing Hari's mother about his death too requires interpretation. ;Apolitical intellectuals Otto Rene Castillo's famous words are quoted at a point during the course of the film: : \\"One day the apolitical intellectuals of my country will be interrogated by the simplest of our people. They will be asked what they did when their nation died out slowly, like a sweet fire small and alone.\\" These words deliberately quoted in the film by John may be the essence of this film, which make this film relevant even today. The formation of a class of apolitical intelligentsia in a democratic system is the biggest threat to the root of this system. Politics for democracy is synonymous to oxygen for life. When the philosophy of an intellectual turns out to be apolitical, his action results in the very destruction of a democratic system. By the end of the film, just after the crowd informs Hari's mother about his death, the official messengers within the system, the police reach there and convey the same piece of information to the mother. The mother, the nation expects this tragic news at any moment about her rebellious child. But is that all the information that the mother expects from these messengers? Hari, the rebellious citizen, who walked out of the system, possibly to recast the system, might have committed suicide, accepting failure in his mission, or might have died like a brave soldier or his death, might even be a murder. The reason for this death, which the crowd failed to probe and find out, is politics in a system. The crowd that never bothered about this vital issue is not a movement capable to act as the backbone of a system but just a crowd of apolitical individuals. This crowd doesn't succeed in finding out the reasons for the decay of the system, but finally starts decaying themselves. It's not just such a mob that should emerge from this system, but politically conscious movements. These movements are not destined to bear the burden of dead bodies of 'martyrs', who commits suicide. Their mission should be to probe into the reasons behind these suicides. In the film, the mothers who react to the news of death of Hari are shown worried and sad about the youth moving towards self-destruction. The Nation too grieves the death of its citizen. In other words, citizens themselves make the entity called the Nation, it's his duty to perpetuate the Nation. Hari's death may be a tiny isolated flame, but it has the potential to grow into an inferno, which would set ablaze the Nation itself. This alarming truth is seen repeatedly in History books. Hence the Nation desires to know about the reasons behind the decay of the system. But the apolitical intelligentsia, who never bothers to probe these reasons, one day, would definitely be questioned by the poorest of the poor. This quotation used by John Abraham could be a prophecy about that day, the day, which this crowd of apolitical intelligentsia would be questioned. A piece of art becomes noble when its importance extends from present to the future, when the artist turns out to be a prophet. John too was a prophet. He prophesied the pathetic spectacle of today, where apolitical crowds labelled 'political parties' join together in a procession carrying burdens of dead bodies termed 'martyrs', forgetting reasons and ideologies, believing that the petty knowledge they procured during this journey towards perdition as ultimate truths, never bothering about the real politics of this system, continuing this journey with mere the information of the death of a citizen to the Nation. It would also be interesting to find out the fate of the crowd after accomplishing their mission, which John left for our judgement. We understand that this crowd never dispersed after accomplishing their mission. These crowds found out more and more dead bodies like that of Hari's and are still continuing their procession carrying these burdens. It could even be concluded that a movement's birth itself coincides with the identification of a dead body. For this movement to gain momentum a crowd is formed. A dead body not only means that the individual is dead but also acts as a pointer towards number of truths, the ideas, dreams, aspirations and struggle the individual had undergone during his lifetime, which these crowds never try to understand.

Often such devices do not produce actual white noise, which has a harsh sound, but pink noise, whose power rolls off at higher frequencies, or other colors of noise. Use White noise devices are available from numerous manufacturers in many forms, for a variety of different uses, including audio testing, sound masking, sleep-aid, and power-napping. Sleep-aid and nap machine products may also produce other soothing sounds, such as music, rain, wind, highway traffic and ocean waves mixed with‚Äîor modulated by‚Äîwhite noise. As an alternative to white noise machines, many Westerners will use a fan to help get to sleep. According to a recent Gallup Poll up to 80% of Westerners will use a fan to help get to sleep. Whereas many Asian communities will not use a fan due to the superstition that a fan can suffocate them while sleeping. White noise generators are often used by people with tinnitus to mask their symptoms. The sounds generated by digital machines are not always truly random. Rather, they are short prerecorded audio-tracks which continuously repeat at the end of the track. Manufacturers of sound-masking devices recommend that the volume of white noise machines be initially set at a comfortable level, even if it does not provide the desired level of privacy. As the ear becomes accustomed to the new sound and learns to tune it out, the volume can be gradually increased to increase privacy. Manufacturers of sleeping aids and power-napping devices recommend that the volume level be set slightly louder than normal music listening level, but always in a comfortable listening range. Sound and noise have their own measurement and color coding techniques, which allows specialized users to identify noise and sound according to their respective needs and utilization. These specialized needs are dependent on certain professions and needs, e.g. a psychiatrist who needs certain sounds for therapies and treatments on a mental level, and patients who have conditions such as insomnia, anxiety, and, tinnitus (these conditions are managed with special devices which are designed to create certain sounds that treat such conditions at a mental level). A white noise machine has ‚Äúwhite‚Äù as the color code given to that noise having a particular frequency spectrum. =Audio jammers= White noise machines are used to diminish the potential for recording or overhearing conversations. Republican Glen Casada had a white noise machine installed in his office to prevent against eavesdropping. Smart speaker blockers have been developed. For example, Bracelet of Silence is a bracelet that outputs white noise to protect privacy against digital recording from smart speakers. Bracelet of Silence is portable and not attached to smart speakers, thus it is possible that this device can be used to prevent eavesdropping of other devices as well, for example smartphones and laptops. There is not a lot of research on the impact of loud sounds at inaudible frequencies (and their respective audible artifacts and harmonics). Design Most modern white noise generators are electronic, usually generating the sound in real-time with audio test equipment, or via electronic playback of a digital audio recording. Simple mechanical machines consist of a very basic setup, involving an enclosed fan and, optionally, a speed switch. This fan drives air through small slots in the machine's casing, producing the desired sound.

In plants, the transpiration stream is the uninterrupted stream of water and solutes which is taken up by the roots and transported via the xylem to the leaves where it evaporates into the air/apoplast-interface of the substomatal cavity. It is driven by capillary action and in some plants by root pressure. The main driving factor is the difference in water potential between the soil and the substomatal cavity caused by transpiration.  Transpiration  Transpiration can be regulated through stomatal closure or opening. It allows for plants to efficiently transport water up to their highest body organs, regulate the temperature of stem and leaves and it allows for upstream signaling such as the dispersal of an apoplastic alkalinization during local oxidative stress. Summary of water movement: #Soil #Roots and Root Hair #Xylem #Leaves #Stomata #Air  Osmosis  The water passes from the soil to the root by osmosis. The long and thin shape of root hairs maximizes surface area so that more water can enter. There is greater water potential in the soil than in the cytoplasm of the root hair cells. As the cell's surface membrane of the root hair cell is semi-permeable, osmosis can take place; and water passes from the soil to the root hairs. The next stage in the transpiration stream is water passing into the xylem vessels. The water either goes through the cortex cells (between the root cells and the xylem vessels) or it bypasses them ‚Äì going through their cell walls. After this, the water moves up the xylem vessels to the leaves through diffusion: A pressure change between the top and bottom of the vessel. Diffusion takes place because there is a water potential gradient between water in the xylem vessel and the leaf (as water is transpiring out of the leaf). This means that water diffuses up the leaf. There is also a pressure change between the top and bottom of the xylem vessels, due to water loss from the leaves. This reduces the pressure of water at the top of the vessels. This means water moves up the vessels. The last stage in the transpiration stream is the water moving into the leaves, and then the actual transpiration. First, the water moves into the mesophyll cells from the top of the xylem vessels. Then the water evaporates out of the cells into the spaces between the cells in the leaf. After this, the water leaves the leaf (and the whole plant) by diffusion through stomata. See also * Soil plant atmosphere continuum for modelling plant transpiration.

The series starred Charlotte Fich as DCI Ingrid Dahl, an ambitious detective who is promoted to the role of unit commander seemingly on the basis of being female. The series co-starred Mads Mikkelsen and Lars Brygmann as Sergeants Allan Fischer and Thomas La Cour. A total of thirty-two episodes aired across four series. Each episode is titled with a reference to an assistancemelding, which roughly translates into English as \\"Request for Assistance\\". Each case portrayed in the show was loosely based upon actual sensational crimes such as murders, kidnappings, cross-border sex trafficking and child pornography. Production The series was predominantly filmed at TV-Drama's film studio at TV-byen in S√∏borg, Denmark, as well as on location. Filming also took place in Sweden, Germany, Iceland and other close regional countries. The format of each episode balances the forensic process and an unfolding backstory that includes the somewhat ambivalent relationships existing between the unit members and their families. The series regularly touches on social issues including the insularity of police work, the social and emotional impact of brutal crime, as well as political and press involvement in the justice process.

Single mother of Tobias (by former husband) and guardian of Gry, the daughter of her late partner. Promoted to a leadership position, she initially struggles to gain the respect of the team and her superior, Ulf Thomson. During the series Ingrid suspect that Ulf is her father. Her suspicion is eventually revealed to be true. * Mads Mikkelsen as DS Allan Fischer; the \\"problem child\\" of the unit. Impulsive and emotional, Fischer has been frustrated by a lack of advancement, as he is seen by Ulf and Ingrid as \\"difficult to manage\\". Despite his rough edges his persistence, physicality and willingness to bend the rules often produces results and he is thus highly valued as a member of the team. * Lars Brygmann as DS Thomas La Cour; the most cerebral member of the unit. La Cour is noteworthy for his highly intuitive investigative approach that often plays a key role in solving a mystery. Most episodes include a sequence where La Cour seems to mystically \\"channel\\" the victim and/or perpetrator in order to re-create the crime event. The portrayal of these moments sometimes suggest the supernatural, such as an episode when an off-duty La Cour leads local police directly to the murder scene and thus places himself under suspicion for the crime. * Waage Sand√∏ as DI Jens Peter \\"I.P.\\" S√∏rensen; the senior member of the unit. I.P. was passed over for promotion when Ingrid was appointed commander. Partner to Kirsten. A world-weary but trusted and quietly supportive second-in-command to Ingrid. Has been with the force for 40 years. * Erik Weders√∏e as Commander Ulf Thomsen; a senior police official, under whom the unit operates. Appointed Ingrid as commander of the unit. The promotion seems at least partially the product of political pressure to elevate a female. Ulf frequently challenges Ingrid's decisions but his respect for her is revealed over time. Ulf's affair with Kirsten and promotion of Ingrid has complicated his longstanding relationship with colleague I.P. * Trine Pallesen as DC Gaby Levin; a junior member of the unit. Develops relationship with Johnny Olsen. Gaby is portrayed as the \\"glue that often holds the unit together\\", managing unit logistics, and she is heavily relied upon by Ingrid and other unit members. * Lars Bom as Johnny Olsen; a contract truck owner/operator. Responsible for moving the Rejseholdet mobile office between locations. Partner of Gaby. Former Danish national football (soccer) star, frequently \\"unofficially\\" involved in the unit's police work. * Michael Falch as Jan Boysen; a forensic pathologist working with the Danish Police who pursues Ingrid romantically. * Sebastian Ottensten as Tobias; Ingrid's teenage son. Tobias's brushes with the law (smoking hashish and joyriding in a stolen car) have been used to illustrate Ingrid's conflicted state as an ambitious career officer and a single mother. * Lisbet Lundquist as Kirsten J√∏rgensen, a successful stage actress and I.P.'s partner during the first season.

His 1990 and early 1991 experience were described in a 2006 interview, in which he spoke of the CIA role in assessing Iraq in preparation for the 1991 war. At that time, according to Pillar, the intelligence community (IC) judged that Iraq had active programs for development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). \\"One of the revelations after the invasion and after the inspections began in Iraq was that some of those programs had gone farther than had been believed. The intelligence community had undershot, if you will, in its assessment of just how far along, especially on the nuclear program, the Iraqis had been\\". Pillar notes, \\"I did not receive any [intelligence] requests from a policy-maker on Iraq until about a year into the war ... policymakers decided \\"My goodness, this shows us how much we might not know.\\" And as people like the vice president and others repeatedly reminded in the lead-up to the Operation Iraqi Freedom, \\"We don't know what we don't know.\\" [said by Donald Rumsfeld]\\" He was a Federal Executive Fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1999-2000. From 2000 to 2005, Pillar worked at the National Intelligence Council as the national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia, \\"responsible for production and coordination throughout the U.S. Intelligence Community of National Intelligence Estimates and other Community assessments\\". After December 2004, the National Intelligence Council, to which national intelligence officers report, moved from the CIA to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Observations and recommendations about Congressional oversight of intelligence Paul Pillar, National Intelligence Officer for the Middle East between 2000 and 2005, wrote, in Foreign Affairs, \\"Intelligence affects the nation's interests through its effect on policy. No matter how much the process of intelligence gathering itself is fixed, the changes will do no good if the role of intelligence in the policymaking process is not also addressed ... But a few steps, based on the recognition that the intelligence-policy relationship is indeed broken, could reduce the likelihood that such a breakdown will recur.\\" He emphasized the need for \\"a clear delineation between intelligence and policy\\", suggesting that the United Kingdom sets an example \\"where discussion of this issue has been more forthright, by declaring once and for all that its intelligence services should not be part of public advocacy of policies still under debate. In the UK, Prime Minister Tony Blair accepted a commission of inquiry's conclusions that intelligence and policy had been improperly commingled in such exercises as the publication of the \\"dodgy dossier\\", the British counterpart to the United States' Iraqi WMD white paper\\". The National Intelligence Council, and its National Intelligence Officers, act as an intelligence \\"think tank\\", and routinely consult with experts outside government. Pillar has been criticized for leaking the NIC's advice to President George W. Bush in the course of such consultations. Pillar suggested that an American equivalent of the issues \\"should take the form of a congressional resolution and be seconded by a statement from the White House. Although it would not have legal force, such a statement would discourage future administrations from attempting to pull the intelligence community into policy advocacy. It would also give some leverage to intelligence officers in resisting any such future attempts.\\" =Inadequacies of current practice= Pillar criticized Congress both for not using the intelligence made available to it, as well as not necessarily asking questions about information not provided to them. > The proper relationship between intelligence gathering and policymaking > sharply separates the two functions. ... Congress, not the administration, > asked for the now-infamous October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) > on Iraq's unconventional weapons programs, although few members of Congress > actually read it.

While there is a CIA \\"politicization ombudsman\\", Pillar described the function as informally defined, and primarily listening to internal concern about politicization, and summarizing this for senior CIA officials. While he believes the intelligence oversight committees should have an important role, \\"the heightened partisanship that has bedeviled so much other work on Capitol Hill has had an especially inhibiting effect in this area\\". =Recommendation for improved legislative oversight= In the Foreign Affairs article, Pillar said that the legislative branch is the proper place for monitoring > ... the intelligence-policy relationship.

Commentary by and about Pillar There have been a series of press comments, for and against Pillar, starting before the 2004 United States Presidential election. Pillar also made several public speeches and publications. Pillar was still a National Intelligence Officer in 2004. =2004= Before the 2004 Presidential election, The Wall Street Journal editorial page criticized \\"CIA insurgents\\", including Pillar, for \\"engaging in a policy debate\\" and were \\"clearly trying to defeat President Bush and elect John Kerry\\". The piece asserted that Pillar had a \\"lousy track record\\" in assessing the terrorist threat and that he rejected the \\"war\\" metaphor for counterterrorism, comparing it instead to \\"the effort by public health authorities to control communicable diseases\\". The editorial also asserted that Pillar commented in a public lecture at Johns Hopkins University that \\"secular\\" Baathists in Iraq would never cooperate with fundamentalists like al-Qaeda. The editorial writer asserted, \\"Tell that to Abu Musab al Zarqawi and the Baathists now cooperating in Fallujah.\\" In September 2004, Robert Novak wrote, \\"I reported on Sept. 27 that Paul R. Pillar, the CIA's national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia, told a private dinner on the West Coast of secret, unheeded warnings to Bush about going to war. I learned of this because of leaks from people who attended, but many other senior Agency officials were covertly but effectively campaigning for Sen. John Kerry.\\" Amy Sullivan of the Washington Monthly, wrote that Pillar's remarks had been made at an off-the-record dinner party. Pillar had said, at the party, that the CIA had warned the White House, in January 2003, that war with Iraq \\"could unleash a violent insurgency in the country\\". Sullivan wrote \\"Novak wasn't at the dinner, which was conducted under established background rules‚Äîthe substance of Pillar's remarks could be reported, but not his identity or his audience. But someone there told Novak about it. So Novak, apparently feeling bound by no rules, outed Pillar by identifying him as the speaker. It's a trick he uses often‚Äîothers attend off- the-record meetings or briefings, tell him about it, and he reports not just what was said, but fingers those who spoke as well.\\" In an October 2004 op-ed in the Washington Times, John B. Roberts II described Pillar is \\"a longstanding intellectual opponent of the policy options chosen by President Bush to fight terrorism\\". Roberts questioned Pillar's suitability to lead the writing of the NIE on Iraq, accusing him of disclosing, to academics and other nongovernmental personnel with whom the National Intelligence Council speaks, the advice given to President Bush. Another critic of Pillar's speaking against Administration policy, focused around the dinner speech cited by Novak, suggested that CIA management, as a whole, might have been politicized against the Bush Administration. Observing that Pillar's speech was preapproved by CIA management, Stephen F. Hayes of the Weekly Standard questions why \\"A senior, unelected CIA official‚ÄîPaul Pillar‚Äîwas given agency approval to anonymously attack Bush administration policies less than two months before the November 2, 2004 presidential election ... His was not an isolated case; CIA officials routinely trashed Bush administration policy decisions, often with official approval, in the months leading up to the Iraq War and again before the election\\". =2005= Pillar was a major participant in a conference \\"sponsored by the John Bassett Moore Society of International Law, University of Virginia School of Law, and the Strategic Studies Institute (SSI), U.S. Army War College, and was held February 25‚Äì26, 2005. Conference participants included representatives from government agencies involved in the U.S. war on terrorism, students and faculty members from other universities\\". Pillar coauthored a monograph from SSI, entitled Law vs. War: Competing Approaches to Fighting Terrorism. =2006= In early 2006, he wrote an article for Foreign Affairs criticizing the Bush Administration for cherry picking intelligence to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Pillar wrote that the Administration went to war in Iraq \\"without requesting‚Äîand evidently without being influenced by‚Äîany strategic-level intelligence assessments on any aspect of Iraq. It has become clear that official intelligence was not relied on in making even the most significant national security decisions, that intelligence was misused publicly to justify decisions already made, that damaging ill will developed between [Bush] policymakers and intelligence officers, and that the intelligence community's own work was politicized\\". Scott Ritter, writing on his blog in February 2006, agreed with Pillar's assessment of politicization, but suggested that Pillar had mixed motives in limiting \\"his criticism to the Bush administration during the time period leading up to the invasion in March 2003\\". Ritter criticizes Pillar for not mentioning \\"the issue of regime change and the role played by the CIA in carrying out covert action at the instruction of the White House (both Democratic and Republican) to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Because he was the former national intelligence officer for Near East/Middle East affairs, I find this absence both disconcerting and disingenuous. By failing to give due credence to the impact and influence of the CIA's mission of regime change in Iraq on its analysis of Iraqi WMDs, Mr. Pillar continues to promulgate the myth that the CIA was honestly engaged in the business of trying to disarm Iraq\\". Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus called Pillar's critique \\"one of the most severe indictments of White House actions by a former Bush official since Richard A. Clarke\\" and noted that this article was \\"the first time that such a senior intelligence officer has so directly and publicly condemned the administration's handling of intelligence\\". In an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, he elaborated on the politicization of intelligence on which he wrote in the Foreign Affairs article. Pillar said that the Silberman- Robb commission did not go into as much depth on the \\"differential treatment that different draft intelligence assessments get as they go through the procedure of being coordinated and approved. And you have to remember, anything that sees light of day as a published‚Äîpublished in the sense of a classified paper‚Äîintelligence assessment goes through usually multiple levels of review, various supervisors, branch chiefs and so on, weighing in, approving or disapproving, remanding, forcing changes. That can be a speedy process or it can be a long, very torturous process\\". He said the Commission found that assessments that tended to justify a casus belli with Iraq went through approval faster than those that did not support war. Pillar agreed, but said the Commission also should have asked why this occurred. According to Pillar, \\"I think the most important reason, besides the overall mind-set that turned out to be erroneous, was the desire to avoid the unpleasantness of putting unwelcome assessments on the desks of policymakers\\". =2007= In 2007, Novak decried Pillar's alleged leaking to the media of portions of a National Intelligence Estimate he viewed as supporting his policy path, though he acknowledged that Pillar denied leaking the report. The New York Times editorial page defended Pillar, noting that the Bush administration did not even ask the CIA for an assessment of the consequences of invading Iraq until a year after the invasion. > When the administration did finally ask for an intelligence assessment, Mr. > Pillar led the effort, which concluded in August 2004 that Iraq was on the > brink of disaster. Officials then leaked his authorship to the columnist > Robert Novak and to The Washington Times. The idea was that Mr. Pillar was > not to be trusted because he dissented from the party line. Somehow, this > sounds like a story we have heard before. A Wall Street Journal op-ed criticized Pillar's choices in releasing information. Its author observed that \\"CIA officers on the cusp of retirement often enroll in a seminar that is supposed to help them adjust to life after the agency‚Äîteaching them, for example, how to write a r√©sum√©. I've begun to wonder if part of that program now includes a writing seminar on how to beat up on the Bush administration.\\" The author, Guillermo Christensen, agrees Pillar was central in the CIA's analysis of Iraq. Regarding the Foreign Affairs article, Christensen questions if that was the place to publicize that he thought the war was a bad idea and the President and advisors ignored him. He makes the assumption that But Pillar \\"actually did change his mind about all that work he'd done, and that he really did think the intelligence didn't support the case for war. If that was truly so, no one was better positioned to make the case against war within the government than Mr. Pillar himself\\". Christensen suggested that Pillar could have sent personal observations, with all relevant classified data, to senior Executive Branch officials. Further, Christensen suggested \\"that analysis with every single member of Congress by writing less-classified summaries of the conclusions, as is often done\\". Thomas Joscelyn, in the Weekly Standard, wrote, \\"Pillar demonstrates that he himself is a master of the art of politicizing intelligence. Far from being a dispassionate analyst, Pillar practices the very same 'manipulations and misuse[s]' he claims to expose\\". Joscelyn reasserted the conjecture that Saddam Hussein had a cooperative relationship with al-Qaeda. However, the official conclusions of investigations by the CIA, FBI, NSA, State Department, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and the independent 9/11 Commission have all confirmed Pillar's view that there was no collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. =2011= Pillar's Intelligence and US Foreign Policy: Iraq, 9/11, and Misguided Reform was reviewed by Steve Coll in The New York Review of Books.Our Secret American Security State February 9, 2012 Formal publications by Pillar =Books= Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy Pillar's interest in foreign policy resulted in a book Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy first published in 1999 and updated in 2004. The back cover of the book reads: > Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy is an essential guide to more effective > coordination between conventional foreign policy and efforts to prevent > terrorist attacks and activities. This paperback edition includes a new, > extensive, and provocative post-9/11 introduction, along with the author's > in-depth analyses of current terrorist threats, the status of terrorism in > world politics, counterterrorism tools available to the United States, state > sponsors of terrorism, and how best to educate the public about terrorist > threats and counterterrorism. A review of the book in Foreign Affairs says: \\"The book's strength is its nuanced sense of how Washington's counterterrorism policy actually works, day in and day out.\\" The Washington Times wrote: \\"[Pillar] offers a unique introspective of the breadth of radical islam and counterterrorism. ... Pillar's documentations involving the improvement of U.S. Homeland Security policy, such as observing the full range of capabilities of terrorist, as opposed to solely focusing on nuclear, biological or chemical warfare, and interrupting radical islamist operations worldwide, should be noted in the counterterrorism effort.\\" Intelligence and U.S. Foreign Policy Pillar's interest in the relationship between intelligence and policy resulted in the 2011 book, Intelligence and U.S. Foreign Policy. According to the publisher, \\"Pillar confronts the intelligence myths Americans have come to rely on to explain national tragedies, including the belief that intelligence drives major national security decisions and can be fixed to avoid future failures\\". =Articles and conference papers= Pillar emphasized that jihadist terror will continue to become more decentralized, but not wane, after the core of al-Qaeda is disrupted and pursued. with Al Qaeda waning, the larger terrorist threat from radical Islamists is not. Al Qaeda-inspired or trained groups will operate locally, and both ad hoc groups (e.g., the organization that had been led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, as well as established groups such as the Iraq-centered Ansar al-Islam and the Southeast Asian Jemaah Islamiya). Even while having local focus, they tend to share anti-Americanism. Individuals may operate with limited help from organizations. In the past, ad hoc had been deprecated as a term for terrorist organizations, but that grows increasingly true. (See motivations of terrorists and a discussion of the nontraditional clandestine cell system used by such groups.) Participating in a 2006 conference at the Royal Institute of International Relations, he analyzed and assessed the threat of jihadist terrorism on a worldwide basis. He described the threat as being generated by three complementary factors: :#In any beliefs or similar movements, the most unfortunate and indiscreet are the ones that garner the most headlines. Until a more suitable ideology emerges, jihadism may stay as a major focus of radical Islamist activists. :#It is energized by \\"energy from friction along the fault line between the Muslim world and the West.\\" Themes causing friction including cultural imperialism, oppression of Muslims, and lack of respect for religion. Controversy accelerates polarization, as seen in the Danish disturbance over cartoons of the Prophet. :#Social, economic and political conditions contribute to terrorism, but there is much confusion here. Pillar argues with those that claim poverty must not (typo ... original quote?) a claim because the 9/11 hijackers, and Bin Laden himself, is wealthy. He argues there is a difference between a lack of wealth that does not generate terrorism, and \\"frustrated ambition for economic and social advancement, which is.\\" We hear, for example, that economic hardship must not be a root cause of jihadist terrorism because terrorists such as the 9/11 hijackers were not conspicuously poor, and the most prominent jihadist of all, bin Laden, is conspicuously wealthy. In like manner, he argues that authoritarianism is not a cause, because terrorist acts often happen in liberal democracies. And we hear that authoritarian politics must not have much to do with it either because jihadist terrorism takes place at least as often as anywhere else within liberal democracies, in places like New York, Madrid, or London. Pillar's explanation is that it is much easier to stage a terrorist attack in an open society than in the police states in the Middle East. In an article in the March/April 2008 issue of Foreign Affairs, Pillar is critical of two recently published books on purported systemic failures of the intelligence community and the necessity for organizational reform. In an article in the January/February 2012 issue of Foreign Policy, Pillar similarly cites political leadership, not the intelligence community, for most errors of foresight in policy-making.

In 2015 he was inducted into the Blade Magazine Hall of Fame. Background Christopher Stanley Reeve was born on December 4, 1953, in Durban, South Africa. His original vocation was that of tool and die making.Dyer, Keith, Magnum Magazine, ‚ÄúBlade-Maker Extraordinaire‚Äù, May 1983, pages 28‚Äì31 Reeve trained at the Pineware Manufacturing Company, serving a four-year tool- and die-making apprenticeship that finished in 1978. Reeve credits his experience in tool and die for developing his grinding skills and giving him the manufacturing and materials knowledge he needed to jumpstart him in professional knife making.Reeve, Anne, ‚ÄúChris Reeve ‚Äì Knife Maker\\", February 2005 As a young man, Reeve‚Äôs spare time was largely spent engaged in motorcycle racing. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a regular competitor in South Africa‚Äôs Grand Prix motorcycle racing circuit. Unlike many of his competitors, Reeve did not have corporate funding. As a result, Reeve used the highly competitive race setting to hone his problem-solving skills, custom tuning his motorcycle with components often designed and fabricated in his own shop. In 1987, Chris married Anne Cameron in Johannesburg, South Africa. In order to pursue improved business opportunities, Chris and Anne moved to the United States in 1989, and settled in Boise, Idaho.Reeve, Anne, ‚ÄúChris Reeve Knives ‚Äì A Chronology‚Äù, February 2008 In 2003, Chris and Anne were granted US citizenship. Early knifemaking Chris Reeve \\"Survival Knife\\" -- a custom piece that was the forerunner to the One Piece Range manufactured at Chris Reeve Knives Reeve began his knife-making career by chance. Before being called up for a 3-month compulsory military service period in 1975 on the Mozambique / South African border, he noted that the standard army kit did not include a good all-purpose knife. As a result, Reeve decided to design and make one. A subsequent three-month military service period in 1978 was spent on the Angola/ Namibia border. Reeve had previously designed and made for himself a hidden tang knife with a wooden handle, inlaid with silver wire. The climate in Durban where the knife was made is hot and humid, while the Angola/ Namibia area is semi-desert. After a few days in the dry air, the wooden handle had dried and large cracks appeared. This set Reeve thinking about a knife that could be used across all climates without such damage. The idea of an all-steel knife, with both handle and blade made from a single solid bar, started to germinate.Chamberlain, Harry K. III, Knives Illustrated, ‚ÄúShop Tour‚Äù, Spring 1993, pages 64‚Äì69. Reeve‚Äôs resulting one piece knife concept was first produced as a custom knife in 1982. The one piece concept hit production as the 7 inch bladed MK IV, with 40 pieces becoming available for sale early in 1983.Steele, Kevin E., Soldier of Fortune, ‚ÄúReeve‚Äôs Mark IV‚Äù, October 1987, pages 42‚Äì43.

Blade length = 10‚Äù, overall length is 17‚Äù Early in Reeve‚Äôs career, he engaged in making custom knives. Today, Reeve still makes custom knives as time allows. These custom pieces are of his own design, although sometimes there is a cultural influence ‚Äì often European or Japanese. Reeve‚Äôs custom knives include folding knives with uncommon locking mechanisms, daggers and other fixed blade knives of unique styling, and table cutlery. Reeve uses exotic materials, frequently inlaying gold, pearl or unusual types of wood into titanium or wooden handles to create an interesting contrast of color and texture. He learned much of his knowledge of wood from his father who, as a young man, collected stumps and root sections.

The album was released amidst a line-up change for the group, due to the departure of vocalist Ian McCulloch and the death of drummer Pete de Freitas. The remaining members, guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson, were joined by ex-St. Vitus Dance singer Noel Burke, keyboard player Jake Brockman and drummer Damon Reece. The album was produced by former engineer for The Beatles Geoff Emerick at Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey, England, and had a more pronounced psychedelic sound than the group's previous releases. Following the album's December 1990 release, critical reviews were not favourable; critics noted Burke to be a poor replacement for McCulloch, who they believed was an indispensable aspect of the band. After Reverberation failed to chart, the band were dropped by WEA Records and, after two independently released singles, disbanded in 1993. Background and recording During August and September 1987, Echo & the Bunnymen co-headlined a tour of the United States with popular electronic group New Order. Despite the tour passing without incident, the performances were deemed to be of poor quality. Although American audiences were apparently satisfied by the shows, when the group returned to the United Kingdom for an autumn tour the British music press and audiences were not as equally enthusiastic.Adams, p.201 Shortly thereafter the band announced plans to record a self-produced album of \\"savage rock\\" when there was more free time.Adams, p. 202 The group toured the UK and the US again in early 1988.

However, this failed to impress critics; music paper Melody Maker called it a \\"rancid effort\\" and Q said the band had \\"thrown in the towel\\". Following a Japanese tour in April 1988, Echo & the Bunnymen's lead singer, Ian McCulloch, announced that the band were going to split up.Adams, p. 203 Following the announcement, McCulloch returned to the United Kingdom to visit his father who had just suffered two heart attacks but was too late as he died shortly before arriving. After five months of speculation as to whether the split up was genuine, McCulloch met with the other members of the band in September 1988 and, despite the group's attempts to change his mind, told them he was leaving the band.Adams, p. 204 McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview, \\"The last days of The Bunnymen consisted of a bunch of people who were more interested in changing oil in their cars than rock 'n' roll.

The Sony-Wega Music System Concept 51K was chosen by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. As of 1976, Esslinger also worked for Louis Vuitton. In 1982 he entered into an exclusive $2,000,000 per year contract with Apple Computer to create a design strategy which transformed Apple from a \\"Silicon Valley Start-Up\\" into a global brand. Setting up shop in California for the first time, Esslinger and Frogdesign created the \\"Snow White design language\\" which was applied to all Apple product lines from 1984 to 1990, commencing with the Apple IIc and including the Macintosh computer. The original Apple IIc was acquired by the Whitney Museum of Art in New York and Time voted it Design of the Year. Soon after Steve Jobs' departure, Esslinger broke his own contract with Apple and followed Jobs to NeXT. Other major client engagements include Lufthansa's global design and brand strategy, SAP's corporate identity and software user interface, Microsoft Windows branding and user interface design, Siemens, NEC, Olympus, HP, Motorola and General Electric. In December 1990 Esslinger was featured on the cover of BusinessWeek, the only living designer thus honored since Raymond Loewy in 1934. In recent years, Frogdesign has survived two acquisitions. In 2006 it was purchased by Flextronics. Soon afterwards it was purchased by the leveraged buyout firm KKR as part of a group including several Flextronics units, and is now company of the Aricent Group.

Formerly guarding a separate island of its own, the fort and its surroundings have since been joined to Muharraq Island. Arad Fort was built in the typical style of Islamic forts during the 15th century before the Portuguese invasion of Bahrain in 1622. This fort has a beautiful history. A few feuds between the Islamic divisions of Bahrain have taken place here. This fort is one of the compact defensive forts in Bahrain. In its present location, it overlooks various sea passages of Muharraq's shallow seashores. In the past, there was an inaccessible marine channel which was controlled by the local people to prevent ships from breaking through to the island where the fort is located. The fort is square and on every corner there is a cylindrical tower. It is surrounded by a small trench which used to be filled with water from wells that were drilled especially for this purpose. In every corner of the upper wall of the fort there are nose shaped openings for marksmen. Close to the Bahrain International Airport, the fort has been extensively restored and is illuminated at night. Traditional materials have been used in the restoration and maintenance of the fort after making extensive analysis of the original materials such as sea stones, lime, sand, and palm trunks. See Walls, Archibald G., Senior Architect, Ministry of Information, State of Bahrain, Arad Fort: Its restoration, its history and defences, February 1987, Pub. Directorate of Tourism and Archaeology, Ministry of Information, State of Bahrain No cement or any other materials which are not in harmony with the historical building or which reduce its historical value have been used. History Arad Fort is one of Bahrain's most important fortified castles. The Fort was built in the style of Islamic forts at the end of the 15th and early 16th centuries. It is recorded in the Portuguese map, Demonstracao da Ilha de Baren, circa 1635, the significant details being, that the fort is under siege by the Portuguese, and that it had outer and inner fortified walls. Due to its strategic location overlooking various sea passages of Muharraq Island, Arad Fort was used as a defensive fortress throughout history, from the time Bahrain was occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century to the reign of Shaikh Salman Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa in the 19th century. Arad Fort was most recently restored between 1984 and 1987, under the direction of the Historic Buildings and Conservation Architect, Dr Archie Walls. In order to maintain the historical authenticity and value of Arad Fort, exclusively traditional materials were used, such as coral stone, lime and tree trunks. It is believed that the fort was used by the Omanis during their brief occupation of Bahrain in 1800, and it is located adjacent to the strategic waterways between Bahrain Island and Muharraq Island The canon found on top of the Fort's South Bastion pointed directly down the narrow entrance channel, formed by reefs on either side of it, that leads into Muharram Bay. Little is known of the fort's history, and there is no firm evidence of the precise date of construction, but comprehensive excavations have been undertaken in order to discover its past. The Fort's construction follows the 'layered technique' identified by Dr Walls in the mid 1970s, a technique whose origins are in mud brick constructions, see Walls, Archie G., op. cit. and Walls, A.G., Arabian Mud Brick Technology: Some Thoughts after the Bam Earthquake, Construction and History Society Newsletter, No. 69, July 2004, pp. 11‚Äì19 The fort is open for a fee.

It is worshipped by Buddhists. The sacred fig is also venerated in Hinduism and Jainism. Trees are significant in many of the world's mythologies, and have been given deep and sacred meanings throughout the ages. Human beings, observing the growth and death of trees, and the annual death and revival of their foliage, have often seen them as powerful symbols of growth, death and rebirth. Evergreen trees, which largely stay green throughout these cycles, are sometimes considered symbols of the eternal, immortality or fertility. The image of the Tree of life or world tree occurs in many mythologies. Examples include the banyan and the sacred fig (Ficus religiosa) in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil of Judaism and Christianity. In folk religion and folklore, trees are often said to be the homes of tree spirits. Germanic mythology as well as Celtic polytheism both appear to have involved cultic practice in sacred groves, especially grove of oak.Taylor, John W. (1979). Tree Worship, in Mankind Quarterly, Sept., pp. 79-142. . The term druid itself possibly derives from the Celtic word for oak. The Egyptian Book of the Dead mentions sycamores as part of the scenery where the soul of the deceased finds blissful repose.Gollwitzer 1984:13. The presence of trees in myth sometimes occurs in connection to the concept of the sacred tree and the sacred grove. Trees are an attribute of the archetypical locus amoenus. Wishing trees In many parts of the world travelers have observed the custom of hanging objects upon trees in order to establish some sort of a relationship between themselves and the tree. Throughout Europe, trees are known as sites of pilgrimages, ritual ambulation, and the recital of (Christian) prayers. Wreaths, ribbons or rags are suspended to win favor for sick humans or livestock, or merely for good luck. Popular belief associates the sites with healing, bewitching, or mere wishing. In South America, Darwin recorded a tree honored by numerous offerings (rags, meat, cigars, etc.); libations were made to it, and horses were sacrificed.\\"The Voyage of the Beagle\\", Chapter IV World tree Yggdrasil, the World Ash of Norse mythology The world tree, with its branches reaching up into the sky, and roots deep into the earth, can be seen to dwell in three worlds - a link between heaven, the earth, and the underworld, uniting above and below. This great tree acts as an axis mundi, supporting or holding up the cosmos, and providing a link between the heavens, earth, and underworld. In European mythology, the best-known example is the tree Yggdrasil from Norse mythology.Mountfort 2003:41, 279. Religion and folklore Numerous popular stories throughout the world reflect a firmly- rooted belief in an intimate connection between a human being and a tree, plant or flower. Sometimes a man's life depends upon the tree and suffers when it withers or is injured, and we encounter the idea of the external soul, already found in the Ancient Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers from at least 3000 years ago. Here one of the brothers leaves his heart on the top of the flower of the acacia and falls dead when it is cut down. Sometimes, however, the tree is a mysterious token which shows its sympathy with an absent hero by weakening or dying, as the man becomes ill or loses his life. These two features very easily combine, and they agree in representing to us mysterious sympathy between tree and human life. Sometimes the new-born child is associated with a newly planted tree with which its life is supposed to be bound up; or, on ceremonial occasions (betrothal, marriage, ascent to the throne), a personal relationship of this kind is instituted by planting trees, upon the fortunes of which the career of the individual depends. Sometimes, boughs or plants are selected and the individual draws omens of life and death. Again, a person will put themselves into relationship with a tree by depositing upon it something which has been in close contact with them, such as hair or clothing. Often a tree will be associated with oracles. The oak of Dodona was tended by priests who slept on the ground. Forms of the tall oaks of the old Prussians were inhabited by gods who gave responses, and so numerous are the examples that the old Hebrew terebinth of the teacher, and the terebinth of the diviners may reasonably be placed in this category. Important sacred trees are also the object of pilgrimage, one of the most noteworthy being the branch of the Bo tree at Sri Lanka brought thither before the Christian era. The tree spirits will hold sway over the surrounding forest or district, and the animals in the locality are often sacred and must not be harmed. The custom of transferring disease or sickness from men to trees is well known. Sometimes the hair, nails, clothing, etc. of a sickly person are fixed to a tree, or they are forcibly inserted in a hole in the trunk, or the tree is split and the patient passes through the aperture. Where the tree has been thus injured, its recovery and that of the patient are often associated. Different explanations may be found of such customs which naturally take rather different forms among peoples in different grades. In Arab folklore, sacred trees are haunted by jinn; sacrifices are made, and the sick who sleep beneath them receive prescriptions in their dreams. Here, as frequently elsewhere, it is dangerous to pull a bough. This dread of damaging special trees is familiar: Cato instructed the woodman to sacrifice to the male or female deity before thinning a grove, while in the Homeric poem to Aphrodite the tree nymph is wounded when the tree is injured, and dies when the trunk falls. Early Buddhism held that trees had neither mind nor feeling and might lawfully be cut; but it recognized that certain spirits might reside in them, such as Nang Takian in Thailand. Propitiation is made before the axe is laid to the holy trees; loss of life or of wealth and the failure of rain are feared should they be wantonly cut; there are even trees which it is dangerous to climb. The Talein of Burma prays to the tree before he cuts it down, and the African woodman will place a fresh sprig upon the tree. In Hawaiian tradition, a tree either located at the end of a valley or on a cliff near the sea, is used by the soul as a gateway to the Underworld (AKA Pit of Milu). Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or Kadambariyamman, associated with the kadamba tree were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.

Teggiano (formerly Diano; Teggianese: ) is a town and comune in Campania, Italy, in the province of Salerno. It is situated on an isolated eminence above the upper part of the valley to which it gives the name of Vallo di Diano. Among the historic centers of the province, Teggiano is certainly one that has best preserved its ancient appearance of the fortress and it is this aspect which is shown to those who reach the old town. The appearance of a Roman oppidum, still now remembered by the well preserved plan of the Cardo and of the Decumanus, was renewed in the Norman period and in the age of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. History Tegianum was built by Lucanians early in the 4th century BC, and later was a municipal town of Lucania. There was Gracchan colonization in the 2nd century BCE, and a larger colonization program under Nero. During the Middle Ages Diano had a predominant role in the history of the Vallo di Diano. In Norman times, the Sanseverino family, counts of Marsico and later princes of Salerno, took over the fief of Diano, which was composed of the hamlets of Sassano, Monte San Giacomo, San Rufo, San Pietro al Tanagro and Sant'Arsenio. Teggiano was ruled by the Sanseverino for over three centuries (1239‚Äì1556). They chose the castle as a stronghold in which they could take shelter during emergencies. At that time Diano was surrounded by high walls with 25 guard towers and four gates. In 1497, under Antonello Sanseverino of Salerno, the city resisted the siege undertaken by Frederick IV of Naples for 8 months. Following a new rebellion, led this time by Ferrante, last Prince of Salerno, in 1552 the Sanseverino family was expelled from the kingdom. Teggiano became a fief of other noble families including the Gomez da Silva, the Grimaldi, the Caracciolo, the Villani, the Colonna, the Cal√† and Schipani. left In 1564, after the Council of Trent, Bishop Paolo Varallo instituted in Diano one of the first seminaries in Italy, completed in 1601. On July 17, 1586 Pope Sixtus V gave the right to establish the residence in Diano, in the actual see, to Bishop Lelio Morello, giving to Diano Episcopalian prerogatives and raised in the meanwhile the church of S. Maria Maggiore to the honor of Cathedral. The action of the Counter-Reformation and the presence of high offices brought in the later centuries a radical remaking of the Romano-Gothic churches in Baroque style. Two major earthquakes concerned Teggiano's territory: the Neapolitan earthquake that occurred on December 16, 1857 (estimated of magnitude 6.9 on the Richter Scale), and the Irpininan earthquake on November 23, 1980 (measuring 6.89 on the Richter Scale). Main sights Ruins of the ancient city can be traced at the foot of the hill; a Roman bridge is also present. Other landmarks are: *The Sanseverino Castle, built in Norman times. In the early years of the 15th century the country of Diano was forfeited by the Neapolitan Crown due to the expulsion of its feudal lords, the Sanseverino; then the King Ladislaus of Durazzo had the castle restored, ordering that every village in the Vallo di Diano contributed to the expenses. Another restoration was performed in 1417, commissioned this time by the Sanseverino family. *Church and Convent of Saint Francis of Assisi. Its construction dates back to the earliest years of the 14th century, as attested by the inscription placed on the portal, dated 1307. The Convent is considered, around 1340, belonging to the custodia di Principatus of the Order of Friars Minor. The Convent was suppressed in 1808 by the Napoleonic laws. The plan has a \\"barn\\"-like layout, very widespread in the constructions of the Order in the Italian southern area: a rectangular room, covered with a roof hut with a square apse once crowned by a cross vault. In 1745 a false ceiling, painted by De Martino, hid the trusses and the single-lancet windows located to the upper side walls. Frescoes in the convent include Scenes from the life of St. Francis, executed by an unknown master in the first half of the 14th century, and a Franciscan Saints and St. Michael Archangel from the second half of the 15th century. Other features include the 16th century's choir, as well as the cloister with a central well. *St. Antuono church, probably built before the 11th century, and located on the north side of the old town not far from the walls of the Castle. The exterior, with modest structural lines, shows the steeple built in the thick of the facade: on the right side is placed on the portal the architrave decorated with a delicate interweaving arboreal. The interior has a basilica layout: a small main aisle once flanked by two aisles divided by a shrunk colonnade. Part of the right nave was demolished in 1958 to make room for the road. In recent restoration works have emerged on the walls inside an important cycle of medieval frescoes.

In 1930 the British architectural historian Sir Alfred Clapham called it \\"perhaps the most imposing architectural memorial of the 7th century yet surviving north of the Alps\\". It is the largest English church that remains substantially as it was in the Anglo-Saxon era. It was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1954. Building The Peterborough Chronicle records Brixworth as having a monastery, Brixworth Abbey, founded when Sexwulf became bishop of Mercia, before the death of King Wulfhere in AD 675. Many elements from the original building remain visible, along with later additions from further phases of building in the 10th, 14th and 19th centuries. The older building contains features typically found in architecture of a later period, including an ambulatory. Now it is a parish church and a Grade I listed building. Roman architecture can be considered the precedent for early Christian church building; hence the term 'Romanesque'. The church was built in the form of an Early Christian basilica, but with piers instead of columns. Reconstructed plan of Brixworth church in the 7th century What remains of the original building is a clerestoried nave, north and south arcades blocked and infilled with windows, a presbytery separated from the nave by a great arch, and the foundations of a semicircular apse. The west tower was begun as a two- storey porch, heightened in the 10th century to form a tower. In the 13th century a south aisle was added to the nave, a south chapel was added beside the presbytery and the apsidal chancel was replaced with a rectangular one. In the 14th century the west tower was heightened again and the present broach spire was added. Archaeological excavations have shown that the original church had side chambers, called porticus, that would have extended either side of the present nave. At the position of the present tower was a narthex, and original pillars now covered by flooring show that there was a three- arched opening between the nave and the presbytery. The original entrance was at the west end. In the Norman era the present south door was inserted in the westernmost arch of the south arcade. Reclaimed Roman stone and brick tiles were used in the construction of the building. Petrological analysis suggests the sources were the Roman towns of Lactodurum (Towcester) and Ratae Corieltauvorum (Leicester). Roman-sized brick tiles are used in the arcading and other arches. An ambulatory ran around the outside of the original apse below ground level. Originally steps led down to the ambulatory, which was covered by a barrel vault. The purpose of this ambulatory was probably to house or provide access to preserved relics. It has been suggested that Brixworth may have been the site of synods that took place at Clofesho in the 8th and 9th centuries. This might account for the unusually large size of the building by the standards of the time. However, there are other possible candidates for their location and Clofesho's true identity has not been proved. All Saints church seen from the west. The stair turret is 10th- century; the spire and upper stages of the tower are 14th-century. In the 10th century the tower and stair turret replaced the narthex. This is one of four remaining Anglo-Saxon stair turrets in England, and is similar to the one at St Andrew's parish church, Brigstock, about northeast of Brixworth. A triple arch was inserted into the existing masonry of the west nave wall at high level, replacing an existing arch. The arches are supported by baluster shafts, which are typical of Anglo-Saxon architecture, and can also be seen at the tower of All Saints' Church, Earls Barton, about southeast of Brixworth. In the 14th century the upper stages of the tower and the spire were added. The churchyard contains the war graves of three British Army soldiers of World War I and a Royal Pioneer Corps officer of World War II. CWGC Cemetery report, details from casualty record. Victorian restoration In 1865‚Äì66 major works were carried out to the church to the requirements of Charles Frederic Watkins, who was vicar at that time. These involved the removal of a large part of the medieval chancel and exposure of the ambulatory below ground level that surrounded the apse at the east end of the building. The south-east chapel was shortened by one bay and the south porch demolished, in each case to expose earlier stonework. The work included the provision of 247 additional free seats. Bells Anglo-Saxon relief just inside the Norman south door, representing the eagle of St John the Evangelist. It was an arm of a cross and may be 9th-century. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Hugh Watts of Leicester cast the second, third, fourth and fifth bells in 1622. Henry Bagley of Chacombe cast the tenor bell in 1683. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1993. Registers The parish registers start in 1546 and, apart from those currently in use, are kept at Northamptonshire Record Office (NRO). Details of its location and opening times can be found on NRO's website. Rev James Jackson, who was vicar of Brixworth from 1735 to 1770, compiled an analytical index to Brixworth families since the 16th century which incorporated information from his personal knowledge as well as entries from the parish register. It therefore includes considerable information about the origins and destinations of people who arrived in or migrated from the village during the 18th century.

The album was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames and was produced by McCulloch and the band's manager Paul Toogood but was credited to the whole band. Following a successful return to live performances and the release of the single \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\", the album was released in July 1997. Two further singles ‚Äì \\"I Want to Be There\\" and \\"Don't Let It Get You Down\\" ‚Äì followed the album's release.

Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared.Adams, p. 252 McCulloch was not upset about this as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.

Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527 ‚Äì c. 1607) was a Dutch Renaissance architect, painter, and engineer. Vredeman de Vries is known for his publication in 1583 on garden design and his books with many examples on ornaments (1565) and perspective (1604). The Vredeman de Vries family included a number of artists and musicians.  Biography  Christ in the House of Martha and Mary, 1566 Born in Leeuwarden and raised in Friesland, in 1546 Vredeman de Vries went to Amsterdam and Kampen. In 1549 he moved to Mechelen where the Superior Court was seating. Sebastian, his brother, was the organist in the local church. Vredeman de Vries designed ornaments for merry parades of Charles V and Philip II. Studying Vitruvius and Sebastiano Serlio, (translated by his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst), he became an internationally known specialist in perspective. He continued his career in Antwerp, where he was appointed city architect and fortification engineer. After 1585 he fled the city because of the Spanish occupation by Alessandro Farnese. Then the Protestants had to leave the city within two years. Vredeman de Vries moved to Frankfurt and worked in Wolfenb√ºttel, designing a fortification and a new lay- out of the city for Julius, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. After his death the project was cancelled and Hans worked in Hamburg, Danzig (1592), Prague (1596) and Amsterdam (1600). On his trips Vredeman was accompanied by Hendrick Aerts and his son Paul, both painters. His son Salomon was also a painter; Jacob Vredeman de Vries a kapellmeister and composer. Vredeman de Vries tried to get an appointment at the University of Leiden in 1604. It is not known when and where Hans Vredeman de Vries died, however, it is recorded that his son Paul was living in Hamburg when he inherited.

It was founded by Hans Grohe in 1901, in Schiltach, Germany. Hansgrohe is one of the world‚Äôs largest shower head, hand shower and tap suppliers, next to competitors such as Grohe and Kohler. Principal shareholder is the Masco Corporation, Taylor, Michigan, United States. Hansgrohe is not to be confused with the Grohe AG, another German sanitary fittings manufacturer, which was founded by Hans Grohe‚Äôs son Friedrich. Background Hansgrohe has two major shareholders: The family of Klaus Grohe, the founders‚Äô youngest son, holds 32%, Masco Corporation 68%. Hans J√ºrgen Kalmbach became chairman of Hansgrohe in 2018. The company sells its products under two brand names: Axor and hansgrohe. In 2017, Hansgrohe reported sales of 1.077 billion Euro (2016: 1.029 billion Euro). The company employs about 4,962 people, 40% outside of Germany. Hansgrohe manufactures its products in factories in the United States, Germany, France and China. With 34 subsidiaries and 21 sales offices the company is present all over the world. Hansgrohe exports its products into more than 140 countries. Foundation and history In 1901, Hans Grohe, born in Luckenwalde near Berlin on May 14, 1871, founded the company in Schiltach, in the German Black Forest region. As a three-man operation, the company began producing metal pressing products, e.g. parts of watches, brass pans and sheet metal showers, but soon concentrated on sanitary metal ware. Export started with the first delivery to Amsterdam, Netherlands in January 1907. By 1919, 3 office clerks and 48 production employees worked for the company. Hans Grohe started to use a new brass pressing procedure in 1929 and began to chromium- plate his products in 1930. Four years later, his son Friedrich Grohe left the company and took over a company in Hemer, North Rhine-Westphalia, in 1936. While his father Hans concentrated on showers and draining technology, Friedrich Grohe focused on fittings. The company today is known as Grohe AG. In 1968, Klaus Grohe, the youngest son of Hans Grohe, joined the father‚Äôs company and took over its management in 1975. In 1977, he introduced the word and figurative mark Hansgrohe. Under his company leadership, Hansgrohe started to work with external designers in the late 1960s, including Hartmut Esslinger (frog design) and later on Phoenix Design and Philippe Starck. Klaus Grohe also reached out to explore new market segments: In 1981 Hansgrohe began producing faucets and introduced a greywater recycling system in 2001. In 1984, the Friedrich Grohe family, one of the three shareholders at the time, together with the Hans Grohe Junior family, and the Klaus Grohe family, sold their third of shares to the US investment company Masco Corporation from Taylor, Michigan. In 1999, the Hans Grohe Junior family equally sold their shares to the Masco Corporation, making them majority shareholder, and leaving the Klaus Grohe family as the only family shareholder of the company with today 32% of the shares. In 2012, Hansgrohe became a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea SE), which is not listed on the stock exchange. After having been member of the management board for 33 years, Klaus Grohe took over the position as director of the supervisory board in 2008. Since 2015, he has been honorary chairman of the board. In August 2018, Hans J√ºrgen Kalmbach became chairman of Hansgrohe, following Thorsten Klapproth. Two grandsons of company founder Hans Grohe, Richard and Philippe Grohe, were active in the operative business until October 2016. Since then, the founding family supports the company exclusively from a shareholder position, through their representation in the Supervisory Board of Hansgrohe SE.DAF truck with showers by Hansgrohe Hansgrohe in the United States Hansgrohe operates a subsidiary in the United States which has been based in Alpharetta, Georgia since 1996.

The term danza de matachines is also used to refer to their characteristic dance and music. The dance was documented in the 1642 treatise Discursos sobre el arte del dan√ßado by Juan de Esquivel Navarro. The tradition was imported into Latin American countries such as Mexico and Peru. In America Currently, the matachines are societies of North and South American Native dancers who perform ritual dances. They are found from Peru up to northern New Mexico where the Spanish first influenced the New World and introduced Christianity. In Bernalillo, New Mexico, the Matachines de San Lorenzo have been performing for more than 300 years. The Danza de Matachines is explained by oral tradition among most Indian Tribes as the Dance of the Moors and Christians and is the first masked dance introduced by the Spaniards, though its practice outside of the Iberian peninsula changed its cultural and spiritual significance. The dance was adopted by the people, and today many forms of this dance still exist ‚Äî though the dance steps vary among peoples, the dance formations are all similar. Masks continue to be used, but the style changes from village to village, or people to people. Its meaning is as a celebration of native peoples in the Americas and Philippines, and their salvation through the unity of their faith and culture. The Matachines dance for a deeper religious purpose, since most of them join to venerate either Mother Mary (Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Lourdes, Immaculate conception, etc.), a saint (the group usually chooses the saint that pertains to the church they belong to), or simply to worship Christ or God the Holy Trinity, demonstrated by the three forked item symbolized as a \\"Sword of the Holy Trinity\\". Dressed in traditional ceremonial dress and clothing, the chief characters are El Monarca (typically Moctezuma or other tribal leader), the captains (usually consist of 2-4 and are Moctezuma's main generals), La Malinche or Malintz√≠n, the Native or Mestizo woman; and El Toro, the malevolent comic man of the play (also symbolizes Satan, or the Devil, according to Roman Catholic religious interpretations), dressed with the skins of the buffalo and wearing the horns of this sacred ancestor; Abuelo, the grandfather, and Abuela, grandmother. With the help of a chorus of dancers they portray the desertion of his people by Moctezuma, the luring of him back by the wiles and smiles of La Malinche, the final reunion of king and people and the killing of El Toro, who is supposed to have made all the mischief. Much symbolism is seen in these groups. The basic symbolism of the dance is good vs. evil, with good prevailing. All of the cultural artifacts associated with the dance are blessed by a priest.

[Women from the Belarusian- Polish borderland have a unique recipe of a dish that used to be a necessary attribute of any wedding. The festive cake bankukha, that looks similar to the Lithianian ≈°akotis, is considered to be best if it is higher and has many branches.] is a Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian traditional spit cake. It is a cake made of butter, egg whites and yolks, flour, sugar, and cream, cooked on a rotating spit in an oven or over an open fire. History The cake became popular during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1791). Its origins are attributed to either the Italian Queen Bona Sforza of Poland or the Baltic tribe of Yotvingians. The Yotvingians, first mentioned in 5th century B.C. as neuri, well known as great warriors and hunters, while Bona Sforza is known to have implemented many agriculture, infrastructure and manufacture reforms.Klaus Kl√∂ppel: Polnische Ostseek√ºste: Danzig, Masuren, Baedeker, But most likely it's a variation of the German Baumkuchen. Its name means \\"branched tree\\" or \\"tree with many branches\\" due to its distinctive shape (it is often conical, like a pine tree, and with the drips as branches). It is baked in a time- and labor-intensive process, by painting layers of dough onto a rotating spit in a special open oven or over an open fire. It can be decorated with chocolate and flower ornaments, but it is often served plain. ≈†akotis is one of the most important desserts in Lithuanian celebrations, especially at weddings or other special occasions such as Christmas. It was the sweet chosen to represent Lithuania in the Caf√© Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.

Penned by Samuel Vedanayagam Pillai (1826-1889), it was a landmark in Tamil literature, which had hitherto seen writings only in poetry. The book gave birth to a new literary genre and Tamil prose began to be recognized as an increasingly important part of the language. The author was the munsif (a 'Village President' with some judicial powers) of Mayuram (present day Mayiladuthurai near Thanjavur). Influenced by Western ideas of women's liberation and secularism, he set out to publish works that projected his ideals. His first publication was Pen Kalvi (\\"Female Education\\"), which he addressed to his daughters. After witnessing the explosion of novels in Western literature, he set out to publish his groundbreaking novel that would showcase the heroine of the novel as an equal of the hero, if not more savvy and righteous. The story revolves around the protagonist, Prathapa Mudaliar and his travails. Plot introduction The story is a loose collection of events and narratives centered on a naive but good-natured hero and his life and adventures. It begins in a typical forward caste family setting, with the young Prathapa Mudhaliar indulging in hunting and enjoying himself. The plot also introduces the heroine as a rather intelligent and morally upright girl who marries the hero through a myriad of events. Plot summary The novel is narrated in first person. Soon they are separated and the wife is found wandering in the forest. In order to safeguard herself, she dresses up as a man and roams through the jungle. Meanwhile, a nearby kingdom loses its heir to the throne and as per custom, requires that a new king be chosen at random by the royal elephant. The elephant wanders into the forest and decides to put the flower garland on the unsuspecting young lady. Soon, she is proclaimed the chief of the region and carried to the royal palace. The hero, meanwhile, is despondent after losing his wife and goes in search of her. En route to a city, the hero's sandals get torn, and he decides to repair them using the services of a cobbler. He promises the cobbler that if he stitches the footwear properly and the hero is satisfied, he will reward him with happiness. In a few minutes Prathapa's sandals are mended to his satisfaction and he in turn gives the cobbler one rupee (a princely amount in the era in which the novel is set). The cobbler, however, says he is not satisfied with the rupee and demands his \\"happiness\\", since that was the promise of Prathap. Perplexed at this sudden turn of events, a crowd soon gathers and no one is able to resolve the issue. Soon, the matter reaches the court of the new \\"King,\\" who recognizes her husband despite his dishevelled and bewildered face. Prathap, however is unable to recognize the disguise of his wife and addresses her as the King. She decides to settle this dispute by asking the cobbler if he was happy to see the kingdom's new king. He responds positively, to which she replies that since this quarrel with the young man resulted in his visit to the new king, which ultimately made the cobbler happy, he should go back to his duties, since \\"happiness\\" was provided. The cobbler, finding that he has no other way of needlessly harassing the young hero, returns. The \\"King\\" soon reveals herself to her husband in private quarters and, after entrusting the kingdom to a young apprentice in the court, leaves the kingdom. Both return to their house and live happily ever after. Characters *Prathapa Mudhaliar - protagonist of the novel *Gnanambal - Prathap's wife Literary significance and criticism The idea of a novel in Tamil language was an instant hit. Though the level of literacy was still abysmal in late 19th century Tamil Nadu, sales of the book were still higher than expected. The novelty and success of this novel prompted many other writers to produce more such works. The novel was followed by Kamalambal Charitram by B. R. Rajam Iyer in 1893 and Padmavathi Charitram by A. Madhaviah in 1898, and set the trend for Tamil books. =Translations= The book was translated in various other languages including Dravidian languages and in English. The English translation was done by Meenakshi Tyagarajan in 2005. This also convinced many other writers in other Indian languages to write more prose-oriented books. Prathapa Mudaliar Charithram is still translated and published, with Amar Chitra Katha even creating a comic book adaptation of this novel.

American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared on the album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, \\"It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP‚ÄîI hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience.\\" The album is a collection of ballads and has been described as a follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, \\"Will [Sergeant] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'.\\" Release and reception Released in March 1999, \\"Rust\\" was the first single to come from What Are You Going to Do with Your Life?.

Gary Oldman was executive producer. The story was co-written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. It follows the story of Captain James Macleane (Miller) and Will Plunkett (Carlyle), two men in eighteenth century Britain who are both struggling to survive. The characters are loosely based on two genuine highwaymen of the eighteenth century, James MacLaine and William Plunkett, although the story bears little relation to their actual lives.  Plot  1748 England is infested with highwaymen ‚Äî men such as Will Plunkett (Robert Carlyle), a London-based criminal working with his partner Rob (Iain Robertson). When Rob is killed by thief-taker General Chance (Ken Stott) after a botched heist outside debtor's prison, Plunkett must find a way to retrieve a large ruby that his partner had swallowed. What he doesn't know is that the incident was witnessed by James Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), a socialite from the upper echelons of society, who had found himself in debtor's prison. Macleane sees this ruby as his ticket out of debt and decides to steal it. Plunkett ambushes Macleane and forces him to give up the ruby, but when they are discovered by Chance's men, Plunkett swallows it. While in Newgate Prison, the two form a partnership that utilizes Plunkett's criminal know-how and Macleane's social status to bribe their way out of prison. This tentative partnership leads to an unlikely alliance, deemed \\"The Gentlemen Highwaymen\\", where they gladly relieve the gentry of their possessions. When Macleane falls for the beautiful Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), the niece of the powerful Lord Gibson (Michael Gambon), their plans to escape to America go awry. The pair part ways after a disastrous attempt to rescue Lady Rebecca from forced exodus, which leads to the death of Lord Gibson, and the discovery that Macleane has gambled away all of their funds. Macleane is eventually captured and tried for Lord Gibson's murder, earning him a date with the gallows. Plunkett orchestrates a daring escape, aided by Lady Rebecca and the flamboyant Lord Rochester (Alan Cumming). After a tense chase through the city sewers that sees Plunkett exact revenge upon Chance, the three escape to freedom.

The film opened on 1 October 1999 in 475 U.S. theaters, taking in $244,765 during its first three days; total US earnings stand at $474,900. The film received mainly negative reviews from critics, Rotten Tomatoes lists a 24% critic rating from 29 critics, while Metacritic's Metascore is 44 from 27 reviews (indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\"). Derek Elley of Variety wrote, \\"[T]he script and dialogue are nowhere near well-tooled enough, and the film's generally dark, cold look and baroque design play against the lighter touch required. Though he certainly puts the reported $15 million budget up on the screen, helmer Jake Scott (son of Ridley Scott) seems happiest when pushing ahead to his next montage sequence, each of which has the brio that should have informed the whole movie. [¬∂] Carlyle, with a convincing cockney accent, and Lee Miller, as the rumpled pretender, are strong, with considerable chemistry between them.

Early life He was the eldest surviving son of Sir Henry Innes, 5th Baronet (‚Äì1762), and Anne Drummonda Grant (1711‚Äì1771). His grandfathers were Sir Harry Innes, 4th Baronet, who represented the Parliament of Scotland constituency of Elginshire from 1704 to 1707, and Sir James Grant, 6th Baronet, a Member of Parliament for Inverness-shire and Elgin Burghs. Upon his father's death in 1762, he succeeded to the Innes Baronetcy. Dukedom of Roxburghe Through the Innes family, he was a descendant of Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe, and in 1812 established his claim to the vacant Dukedom of Roxburghe. The fight for the succession of the title encompassed seven years of constant litigation; according to one biography, \\"seldom have the lawyers met with a richer harvest. The courts of Edinburgh and London have revelled in conflicting claims, and the House of Lords has been disturbed by never-ending appeals.\\"Portrait Gallery of Illustrious and Eminent Personages of the Nineteenth Century, with memoirs, by William Jerdan, 1833 On the demise of the 3rd Duke, who had never married, his principal titles, and large and productive estates, devolved on William Bellenden-Ker, 4th Duke of Roxburghe, who died shortly thereafter, without heirs. The succession was contested by Major-General Walter Ker and the Right Honorable William Drummond; and only at vast cost decided, on 11 May 1812, in favour of Sir James, as descended from Lady Innes, the third daughter of Hary, Lord Ker, son of the first Earl of Roxburghe. Lord Bellenden was descended from the second Duke; General Ker claimed to be heir male of the first, and Mr. Drummond heir male of the second Earl, so that the issue turned on the construction of an entail, which gave the right to the female line. Other claimants included John Bellenden Ker (c. 1765‚Äì1842), famous as a wit and botanist and the author of Archaeology of Popular Phrases and Nursery Rhymes (1837), whose son was the legal reformer Charles Henry Bellenden Ker (c. 1785‚Äì1871). It is notable that 25 years later, Walter Ker's daughter Essex Ker was involved in litigation against her father's lawyers in connection with bonds issued to cover the costs of the succession litigation.Decisions of the Court of Session: From 12 November 1836 to 11 July 1837, George Robertson and Charles Robertson; Adam & Charles Black, Edinburgh, 1838 Personal life James took the name Innes-Ker, and became the 5th Duke of Roxburghe. He married twice, first on 19 April 1769 to Mary Wray (1729/30‚Äì1807), the eldest daughter of Sir John Wray, 12th Baronet and sister of Sir Cecil Wray, 13th Baronet. His wife died in 1807 and he remarried to Harriet Charlewood on 28 July 1807. Harriet was a daughter of Benjamin Charlewood, of Windlesham, Surrey. Together, they were the parents of: * James Henry Robert Innes-Ker (1816‚Äì1879), who married Susanna Stephania Dalbiac, the only child of Sir Charles Dalbiac. Innes-Ker died on 19 July 1823, and was succeeded in the Dukedom by his only son from his second marriage. Four years after his death, his widow remarried to Lt Col Walter Frederick O'Reilly, CB of the Royal African Corps, on 14 November 1827. =Descendants and legacy= Through his son James, he was a grandfather of James Henry Robert Innes-Ker, 7th Duke of Roxburghe (1839‚Äì1892), who married Anne Emily Spencer-Churchill, daughter of the John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough.\\"Lord R.

Description Castleknock Castle atop the motte November 2018 \\"The position of the castle is commanding, and its two deep ditches, and the ruins of its massive walls, bespeak its former strength. The Castle itself is thickly clad with ivy, and the entire hill covered with large and spreading trees. The whole is now reserved ground, enclosed with a strong fence. The solemn gloom of the place, its dark winding walks, and the profound silence that reigns around, make it a delightful solitude.\\"Biblioth√®que Imperiale of Paris A mound may have preceded the present medieval Norman structure. The polygonal keep was the notable feature of the castle. Attached to it was a large squat building. A curtain wall, interspersed with towers, surrounded the castle. There is a moat or ditch constructed around the castle. Today, the site is surrounded by trees while the ruins are seldom visible from the road except in winter. The earliest extant drawing of the castle by Francis Place also shows it in ruins, but somewhat less dilapidated than at present. There is also a small mound to the west of Castleknock College buildings known as Windmill Hill. There is a water tower there now which was built originally as an observatory by a previous owner, Simon Guinn. History =Cromlech= There is evidence of the site's importance prior to the erection of the castle in the Norman period. An ancient pagan cromlech was discovered. \\"In the year 1861, an ancient Cromlech, or Druid's altar, was discovered in the interior of the old Castle when digging the grave of the Rev. Thomas Plunket. The workmen, coming on a large flat stone, found it too heavy to remove, and immediately commenced to break it. They succeeded after great difficulty, but on detaching a portion, they found, to their surprise, an empty space beneath, and a human skeleton lying at full length. The head and larger bones were almost perfect, and with them were small heaps of dry, whitish dust. The men not understanding the nature of their discovery, placed the bones a little aside, and continued their work. It was not till the grave was filled up, and it was too late to remedy the evil, that the whole matter came to light. From the description given by different persons who were present, there is no doubt that the discovered grave was one of those ancient Cromlechs, or altar tombs, which were used as burial places for kings or notables during the Pagan times. The skeleton in this case was so old that the admission of air caused a portion of the bones to fall into dust; this accounts for the small heaps of whitish dust which were found with the larger bones.\\" =Cnucha= \\"In the year 726\\", say the Four Masters, \\" died Congalach of Cnucha.\\" In the old translation of the annals of Clonmacnoisc, he is called \\" Konolagh of Castleknock.\\" In the Annals of Ulster we read \\" Congalach Cnucho moritur; and in the Annals of Tigernach \\"Congalach Cnuchaensis moritur.\\" We know nothing respecting Congalach, but that he died at his fort, Cnucha, towards the beginning of the eighth century.\\"Biblioth√®que Imperiale of Paris https://archive.org/stream/irishecclesiasti07dubluoft/irishecclesiasti07dubluoft_djvu.txt =Castle origins: the Baron of Castleknock= The castle was founded by the Norman knight, Hugh Tyrrel, who was later created Baron of Castleknock. He chose this location near the end of the esker which stretches from Galway to Dublin. Built on two mounds of the esker, it commanded the route into Dublin from the west. Castleknock was the final rallying point for the forces of the last High King of Ireland, Rory O'Connor. He failed to drive the Cambro- Normans from the area around Dublin in 1171. At that time the old fort underwent many changes. Tyrrel strengthened his fortress with all the improvements of modern warfare, and in a short time the Norman castle stood aloft in grim defiance, with its heavy battlements and deep double ditch. The battering ram could not approach it, and the missiles thrown against it fell harmless to the ground 'as hailstones from the rounded shield.'\\" .\\" =Foundation of Abbey by Richard Tyrrell= The Abbey of St. Brigid was founded where the Protestant church now stands, by Richard Tyrrell, second Baron of Castleknock, in 1184, and continued to flourish until the suppression of the monasteries, when it was demolished, and a Protestant church built on the site. In ancient times Castleknock furnished two canons to the Cathedral of St. Patrick, and still today two prebends of St. Patrick's derive their titles from \\"Castrum Noc ex parte diaconi, et Ca-strum Noc ex parte praecentoris\\". Capture by Robert the Bruce The Bruces advanced on Dublin (1316). A short time before, Edward Bruce had been crowned King of Ireland at Dundalk, and thinking the time had come for the expulsion of the English, he invited his brother Robert to his assistance. The King of Scotland landed in Ireland with a select body of troops, and, being joined by his brother, marched to besiege Dublin with 20,000 men. The first exploit on approaching the city was the taking of Castleknock. It could not be expected that the old fortress, long deemed impregnable, could long hold out against the hero of Bannockburn. Bruce entered, making Hugh Tyrrell prisoner, and fixed there his headquarters. It was now believed that the liberation of Ireland was at hand. There was feasting and rejoicing in the Castle. The Irish and Scottish chieftains met at the same board, and plaids and bonnets mingled, with garments of saffron hue. But joy quickly gave place to gloom. Bruce soon perceived that Dublin was fully prepared for a siege, and well provided with provisions from the sea. Moreover, the ardour of the citizens caused him to relinquish all hope. After remaining a few days in the Castle, he released Tyrrell on payment of a ransom, and retired from the city. But he had scarcely commenced his march, when he seemed to repent of his resolution, and halted again at Leixlip. After a short delay he recommenced his march towards the south, and soon after left Ireland, leaving his brother to continue the war. Legend \\"THE LADY OF THE CASTLE ; CTR THE STORY OF EIBHLEEN O'BRINN.\\" Of all the facts connected with the history of Castleknock, there is none that has attracted more interest at least, amongst a certain class than the story of Eibhleen O'Brinn. Dr. Burton, in his History of the Royal Hospital, Kil- mainham, has developed it into a tale of considerable length, and an anonymous writer in the Nation has commemorated the event in not ungraceful verse. The facts are as follows : In the early part of the 16th century, Hugh Tyrrell, the last of the name, ruled in Castleknock. During his absence, his brother Roger, by his violence and licentiousness, made the old castle the terror of the neighbourhood, and a \\"stronghold of iniquity.\\" One summer's evening, Roger carried off Eibhleen, the fair daughter of O'Brinn, or O'Byrne, a Wicklow chieftain, who dwelt on a hill to the west of the neighbouring town of Chapelizod, and confined her in the turret of the castle. At dead of night, the maiden heard steps ascending the stone staircase that led to her apartment, and fearing the worst, opened a vein in her neck, by means of her breast-pin, and bled to death. Next morning the fact was divulged, and great indignation was expressed against Tyrrell. Turlogh O'Brinn had taken refuge in the pale from the horrors of war, and hoped to bring up his family in peace, under the protection of the viceroy. The affliction which now befel this peaceful chieftain, excited universal sympathy. At this time, the site of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, was occupied by the Knights of St. John, and one of them, who, as procurator of the house, had become acquainted with the family of O'Brinn, resolved that so public a scandal should not pass unpunished. He consequently assembled his retainers, and marched towards Castleknock. Tyrrell, finding he was to be attacked, declared that he would not take refuge behind his ramparts, but would meet his enemy in the open field. A bloody battle ensued, in which Tyrrell was slain. His tragical end was considered a just punish ment for his many crimes; but the death of the maiden was long regretted by the people, and often in the winter's even- ings, when the rustics gathered round the blazing hearth, many a tear was shed over the sorrows of O'Brinn, and the fate of his daughter Eibhleen. It was long a popular belief, that, at the hour of midnight, a female figure, robed in white, might be seen moving slowly round the castle. This, they said, was Eibhleen, and they called her \\"The Lady of the Castle.\\" \\" When distant chimes sound midnight hour, The spirit pure is seen; And moving round the lonely tower, Looks bright as moonlight beam. And as the moonbeams tint the walls, And light the turret's crest, \\" 'Twas hence\\", she says, \\" my spirit fled, 'Tis here my bones find rest. And here I wander, year by year, For such my lot has been, But soon at end my penance drear, I'll rest in joy unseen.'\\" Her act of suicide, though wholly unjustifiable, was believed to have been palliated by ignorance, and in making the rounds of the castle, she was supposed to be completing her purgatory. The Lady of the Castle has not been seen since the Congregation of St. Vincent got possession of Castleknock; the priests, they say, must have \\"laid the spirit.\\" Impact of the English Civil War \\"COURAGEOUS CONDUCT OF AN IRISH LADY AT THE TAKING OF CASTLEKNOCK\\" Castleknock Castle was the scene of many bloody encounters, including this one recounted by an Irish officer in 1642. It was discovered in the Biblioth√®que Imperiale, Paris. A small pamphlet entitled \\" Courageuse Resolution d'une dame Irlandaise a la prise de Chateau-knock\\", was lately found by accident in the Biblioth√®que Imperiale of Paris. It occupies only six pages I2mo., and seems to have been a letter written by an Irish officer to some friends in France, very soon after the event took place. It was found at the time so interesting that it was immediately published and circulated through Paris. No name is given, but its date is 1642. It is entered in the Biblioth√®que Imperiale, 8vo. No. 955, A. a. It thus commences: \\"The Earl of Ormond, a Protestant, went forth from the city of Dublin on the 28th of last month at the head of 4,000-foot and 500 horse towards the county Meath. \\"The next day he besieged with his army Castleknock, belonging to the Lady de Lacy, aunt of the Earl of Fingal. The husband of this lady was engaged in the army of the Catholics of Ireland. He left his wife in the Castle to keep it with fifty men only, being well assured that her courage was above her sex, in which he was not deceived ; for this lady, by the orders which she gave, caused 400 soldiers of the besiegers to be slain during the four days the siege lasted, and the number of dead would have been greater still, had not the ammunition failed, which this lady having perceived, she caused to be put in one heap all her clothes, money, jewels, and precious moveables, in a word, all that was found of any value within the enclosure of the Castle ; she then set fire thereto, so that there should remain no booty for the enemy. She also rendered useless all the arms which were in the place, having caused them to be broken, with the exception of those with which her soldiers were equipped, and in the light of the fire she harangued her soldiers thus: \\" My faithful servants, you can well judge by the action I am after performing, what hope there is of favour from our enemies, and how little clemency I expect at their hands. I tell you, moreover, that you should not expect quarter from them, but remember the sentence which says, ' let the vanquished hope for nothing from their enemies.' Take courage, then, and combat to death for the faith of your Redeemer ; you can never find a more glorious end, and the sooner to find it, go valiantly to attack the enemy of the Cross, lest, being made prisoners, any of you should, by bad treatment or the violence of torments, fail in the good resolution you have taken of dying to-day for the Catholic Faith ; in which I desire to set you the example by marching at your head.' \\"This done, the besieged set fire to the Castle, and went down, sword in hand, with such resolution that, after a great carnage of their enemies, all that went forth remained dead on the field, with the exception of the lady, who was made prisoner by the Earl of Ormond. \\"After this the Earl sent to Dublin for reinforcements, and pursued his march.\\" Thus terminates this interesting narrative.\\" =General Monk= The castle was partially dismantled after the War of the Three Kingdoms when considerable artillery damage had been done to the castle. \\"When the English Parliament proclaimed war upon King Charles, the Irish adhered to the Stuarts, and the lords of Castleknock joining the national movement, planted the royal standard upon their battlements. From that day their doom was fixed. General Monk marched from Dublin with a strong force and siege train, and sat down before the castle (1642). Things were there in the same state as in the days of the first Tyrrells. The lofty walls, the deep-set windows, the rooms within low and dimly lighted, and the heavy oak benches around, more like machines. of war than articles of luxury. But the garrison was too weak for the defence. A heavy cannonade commenced, and when the walls were shaken to their foundations, and eighty of the defenders had fallen, the signal was given and the place taken by assault. The garrison had acted bravely, but compassion was far from the hearts of the Republicans. The survivors were tried by court- martial, found guilty of fighting against the state, and hanged from those walls they had so bravely defended. Monk, on returning to Dublin, left a strong force in the Castle, for, though much shattered, it was still a position of considerable importance. But its days were numbered.\\" =Owen Roe O'Neill= On his march towards Dublin (1647), finding Castleknock in the hands of the English, he determined to dislodge them. An effort was made to avert the blow. Colonel Trevor appeared at the head of a body of cavalry, but these were quickly routed, and O'Neill commenced another siege. This was too much for the veteran fortress, already tottering to its fall; it surrendered, and breathed its last in the hands of the Irish hero. Present day The green plot of ground enclosed within the old walls is used as a burial place for the priests of St. Vincent de Paul, and many zealous missioners, cut off in the bloom of life, are there interred. It was a happy thought. That spot, purpled with the blood of many a hero, and containing within its bosom the relics of the \\" departed brave\\", is now a consecrated cemetery. Here rest side by side the soldier and the priest of Erin. The one fought for Ireland's temporal interests, the other for her spiritual welfare..

It is supported by a combination of advertising revenue and a $7.50 refundable tax that students pay at each semester's matriculation. Though The State News is supported by a student tax, the faculty and administration do not interfere in the paper's content. The State News is governed by a Board of Directors, which comprises journalism professionals, faculty and students. In 2010, the Princeton Review ranked The State News as the #8 best college newspaper in the country. And in 2015, the Society of Professional Journalists named TSN as the nation's best daily college newspaper for 2014. History The State News traces its roots to March 10, 1909. It was first dubbed The Holcad, chosen by the president of the then- Michigan Agricultural College. Holcad was the name of a ship that carried news from seaport to seaport in ancient Greece. The newspaper was seen as a way for students to defend themselves against charges of hooliganism by the Lansing press. In 1925, the newspaper changed its name to the Michigan State News. Eventually, this got clipped to The State News. The paper was overseen by a university-run publications board. In 1971, the newspaper was spun off from the university into a nonprofit corporation, State News Inc., governed by its own board of directors. The move was designed to protect the student publication from interference by university administrators who might disagree with its content. Its incorporation also protected the university from liability of anything published in The State News. The newspaper's masthead references this, referring to the publication as \\"Michigan State University's Independent Voice.\\" In August 2005, The State News moved its offices from the Student Services Building, where it had resided since the building's opening in 1957, to an off-campus location at 435 E. Grand River Ave. Prior to its location at the Student Services Building, the newspaper had its offices in the MSU Union. In August 2014, the newspaper switched from a broadsheet to a tabloid format, and in April 2015 it ceased publishing a print edition each weekday during the school year, eventually shifting to the current biweekly print format. Controversy and criticism On election day, 1948, The State News, going to press at 7 a.m., became the only morning daily to place Harry S. Truman in the lead for president. In June 1950, the first issue of the summer edition of The State News carried an editorial critical of the Michigan Department of the American Legion's Boy's State program held on the Michigan State College campus. Several days later, June 25, North Korea invaded South Korea initiating the Korean War. The following Monday the state American Legion held its summer encampment and adopted a resolution calling for the suspension of The State News and the expelling of its student editor, Ron M. Linton. Later that week, Michigan State suspended further summer publication of the paper but declined to expel its editor. The school did, however, announce the appointment of a full-time college employee, William McIlrath, as director of the publication with authority over the paper's content. It was later learned that the school had already planned this action but used this incident as a rationale. This culminated a period of six years‚Äîsince the end of World War II‚Äîof increasing irritation of the school's administration by the independent attitude of the student journalists. Returning veterans were a significant portion of the paper's staff and, being several years older than students enrolled directly from high school and matured by war, they tended to exercise a more critical attitude toward campus events. This led to a series of articles and editorials about the difficulty had by African-American male students in getting haircuts, including the refusal of the Union's barber shop to service African-Americans. It also published a series critical of the school's plan to require male cooperative residences to hire \\"house mothers\\"; ultimately, the coops were exempted, but fraternities were not. The State News, to the administration's consternation, exposed the administration's efforts to block unionization of dining room and school service employees. When the local Congressman demanded in 1950 that Michigan State remove left- leaning economist Paul Douglas (later U.S. Senator from Illinois) from its lecture series, the paper fought back in a series of editorials that resulted in the Congressman turning tail. The State News was the first U.S. daily newspaper, commercial or student, to editorially criticize then-U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-WI) for his sweeping charges without proof of communist activities by a number of citizens. In November 1965, four State News editors resigned over the faculty adviser's and the lead editor's decision to spike a story involving Paul Schiff, who claimed he was denied re-admission to MSU for his political views. Internal controversies include a group of junior editors dissatisfied with the editor-in-chief starting a weekly newspaper, Campus Observer, in 1968. The following year, the managing editor took over the editorial reins in response to staff grumbling. In April 1977, a one-day newsroom staff walkout followed the board's appointment of the next top editor when the staff's recommendation was not picked. In 2000, The State News published Fetus-X which regularly contained psychedelic pictures of Jesus breakdancing with dead babies. After protests from the Catholic League, The State News fired artists Eric Millikin and Casey Sorrow. In 2003, an advertisement printed in the State News showed Palestinians celebrating in the street while Israelis lit candles and prayed. The advertisement's caption claimed that these were the reactions to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Pro- Palestinian groups protested outside the MSU Student Services building and demanded that their student fees be refunded. On Veterans Day, 2005, editorial cartoonist Mike Ramsey drew a piece that showed a World War II soldier who liberated concentration camps conversing with a modern-day soldier who was shown holding a torture device. In response, Young Americans for Freedom and the College Republicans picketed the offices of The State News and called for Ramsey's dismissal. Ramsey was not fired. In 2008, the Michigan Supreme Court heard arguments regarding The State News' lawsuit against MSU over Freedom of Information Act issues. The State News received criticism in 2010 for replacing some of its comics with games/puzzles, including new additions of a giant crossword, Octo, Word Finder and Pathem puzzles. In 2010 the State News published Crosswords, Pathem puzzles, Sudoku, Octo, Wordplay and Word Search puzzles. As of 2012 The State News continues to support publishing puzzles and games. In 2018, The State News received national attention for an editorial demanding the resignation of MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon amid fallout from the Larry Nassar sex assault scandal. Simon quit shortly thereafter. Journalistic opportunity Many of the paper's staffers have gone on to professional internships and jobs at the nation's largest newspapers. Alumni of The State News work for news organizations around the world. The newspaper has won the Associated Collegiate Press' Pacemaker award 16 times (in 1963, 1966, 1967, 1970, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1998, 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2009 for print; 2014 and 2018 for online). The award is considered one of college journalism's top prizes. It won in 2003 for coverage of the U.S. invasion of Iraq and a campus riot later in the spring of that year. The State News was also a Pacemaker finalist in 1987, 2010, 2011, 2017 and 2018 and an online Pacemaker finalist in 2005, 2009 and 2017. The Society of Professional Journalists ranked The State News among the nation's best college daily in 2014, and among the top three in 2007 and 2011. Reporters often travel to cover news, especially to out-of-state sporting events, such as the 2009 presidential inauguration, the 2012 and 2016 Democratic and Republican national conventions, the 2014 Rose Bowl Game and 2019 men's Final Four. Clinics and professional development opportunities are provided. A staff photographer at the paper has been named Michigan's College Photographer of the Year by the Michigan Press Photographers' Association each year for most of the last decade. Alumni also have won Pulitzer Prizes, including M.L. Elrick who was part of the Detroit Free Press staff that won the journalism award in April 2009 for their coverage of the texting message scandal of Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Elrick wrote for the State News in 1987-88. Jim Mitzelfeld won in 1994 for beat reporting at The Detroit News, 11 years after serving as editor-in-chief. Investigative work by Charles Robinson at Yahoo! Sports led to the revocation of USC football player Reggie Bush's 2005 Heisman Trophy. Robinson later uncovered millions of dollars in illegal compensation to several dozen football players at the University of Miami (Fla.). Other recent alums of note include Jemele Hill, former co-host of \\"SportsCenter\\" on ESPN who now writes for The Atlantic; Steve Eder, a presidential campaign reporter for The New York Times; and John Hudson, who covers national security for the Washington Post.

He was a permanent member in the national team from the debut match until 2010, and finally poor performances dropped him from the squad, until his comeback in 2015. He is an alumnus of Dharmaraja College, Kandy. He was also a member of the first Twenty20 International match for Sri Lanka, and capped no. 6. Kapugedara re- entered the national side in the mid-2015 and played the role of a middle order batsmen. In December 2019, he retired from all forms of cricket. Domestic career Kapugedera made his first-class debut in a match for Sri Lanka A against New Zealand A in 2005. In domestic cricket, he plays for Colombo Cricket Club. His inconsistency during 2009 has proved costly, with more young players coming through to challenge for his place in the team. Chennai Super Kings put him on sale for the 2009 Indian Premier League, but no team came forward to bid for him despite the very low starting price. In 2012, Kapugedera was included to the Uthura Rudras for Sri Lanka Premier League tournament. He scored 69 runs in a match-winning knock against Basnahira Cricket Dundee, which was Rudras' first victory in SLPL. In Dhaka Premier Division 2014‚Äì15 season, he played for Victoria Sporting Club. In a match against Prime Bank Cricket Club, Kapugedera led his team for a big win with an unbeaten 161 and four wickets. In March 2018, he was named in Kandy's squad for the 2017‚Äì18 Super Four Provincial Tournament. The following month, he was also named in Kandy's squad for the 2018 Super Provincial One Day Tournament. International career =Early years= An aggressive right-handed batsman, Kapugedera got his first taste of international cricket when he made his One Day International debut against Australia in Perth in 2006. He made his Test cricket debut in the first Test against England at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, in May 2006, in which he made a first ball duck in the first innings. A stylish and classical player, he is also known for his big hitting against Brett Lee and his innings of 38 runs from 21 balls, inclusive of 2 fours and 3 sixes, in the first final of the VB Series held in 2006. This innings bolstered Sri Lanka's total and ensured that Australia lost their first home final in 9 years. In 2009 in the second ODI against Pakistan, Kapugedera scored unbeaten 69 runs to lead Sri Lanka to win and series leads 2‚Äì0. =Inconsistency= Although Kapugedera showed huge potential in both one day and Test cricket, with some mature innings, his overall inconsistency lead to him being dropped from both teams. However, after the 2007 Cricket World Cup he began to stabilise his position in the one day team, and in 2008 some good performances cemented his position in the number 4 position. This included a 95 against West Indies when Sri Lanka were in trouble, and in the 2008 Asia Cup. =Prominence= However, the doors were opened him for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in West Indies, where his talents emerged again. The most notable knock came during the match with India on 11 May 2010, where Kapugedera sent India home with a last ball winning six on Ashish Nehra bowling. Sri Lanka needed three runs off the last ball, Kapugedera smashed a mighty shot over cover for six allowing the team for the victory. He scored unbeaten 37 runs in the match. He along with Chamara Silva set the record for the highest 6th wicket stand for Sri Lanka in ODI cricket with 159 runs. Kapugedara along with Angelo Mathews set the record for the highest ever fifth wicket stand for Sri Lanka in T20 World Cup history with 80 runs. On 2 March 2012, Kapugedera was named as a replacement for injured all-rounders in the ODI squad that qualified for the finals of the 2011‚Äì12 Commonwealth Bank Series. =Comeback= Many critics argued that, he probably the best option for the place of legendary Mahela Jayawardena in ODI team, but due to many talented young cricketers, he was unable to enter to the squad, only named to the 15-named squad in Pakistan series 2015. However, after about 3 years of scarcity in international cricket, Kapugedera was called up for the T20I series against Pakistan in July 2015. He made his comeback with a strong note by scoring unbeaten 31 runs in the first match, eventually Sri Lanka lost the match. He scored his highest T20I score of 48* in the second match in this series. The innings was impressed by the commentators, but finally Sri Lanka lost the match and also the series. After 3 years of ODI rest, Kapugedera was included to the ODI squad for New Zealand in 2015‚Äì16 season as a middle order batsman. He was only able to score 8 runs in the first ODI where Sri Lanka were all out for 188 runs and lost the match by 7 wickets. Kapugedera played only one ODI against Pakistan in 2017‚Äì18 season in the UAE. In the match he scored only 18 runs from 30 balls. During the fielding, Kapugedra struck the ball under the right eye after a throw from the keeper Dickwella, caused heavy swelling. After the incidence, he was removed from the next match and then from the series as well. =Captaincy= Kapugedara was appointed as the vice captain of the ODI squad for the series against India in late July 2017. In the second ODI, Tharanga has been suspended with two ODIs due to slow over rate. With that, Kapugedera was appointed as the captain of ODI team for rest of the two ODIs. He captained third ODI, which is a must win game for series alive. However, he won the toss and elected to bat first. The decision went wrong very quickly, where Sri Lanka only managed to score 218 at the end. India won the match easily and won eighth consecutive bilateral ODI series win against Sri Lanka. During the last phase of India's innings, crowd started to throw bottles into the ground and play was arrested for 35 minutes as well. Personal life Kapugedera is married to his longtime partner, Tamara Derek on 16 December 2010 where the wedding ceremony was taken place at Waters Edge Hotel, Battaramulla. They have three children Akshan, Yenith and Yhavin, all of which are boys.

The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in the town of Chenango (just north of Binghamton) in the Southern Tier. The northern terminus is at NY 37 near the village of Morristown in the North Country. In between, the route serves three cities of varying size: Norwich, Utica, and Watertown. NY 12 intersects several primary routes, including US 20 in Sangerfield, New York State Thruway via Interstate 790 (I-790) in Utica, overlaps NY 28 from Barneveld to the town of Remsen, NY 3 in Watertown, and I-81 in Pamelia and Orleans. It is a two lane, undivided, full access roadway for the majority of its length, except between the village of New Hartford and Alder Creek, where it is a four-lane highway. Within that span, it is a limited access highway in the city of Utica, referred locally as The Arterial and the North-South Arterial. The distance between Utica and Binghamton is a major trucking route, and features many gas stations, truck stops, and fast food restaurants. Between Boonville and Lowville, it follows the Black River Valley. Then further north, between Watertown and Morristown, it follows the St. Lawrence River valley. NY 12, as originally assigned in 1924, extended from Chenango in the south to Clayton in the north. It was extended east over the former routing of NY 3 to Alexandria Bay in 1930, then along a new roadway to Morristown in the 1960s. Parts of NY 12 have been rerouted onto new roadways in areas, primarily in Oneida County. Route description =Broome and Chenango counties= NY 12 begins at US 11, which connects it to I-81, north of Binghamton in the Broome County town of Chenango. The route heads north through the Chenango River valley, connecting to I-88 (via NY 12A), and passing west of Chenango Valley State Park before traversing the Tioughnioga River near the community of Chenango Forks. On the northern bank of the river, NY 12 intersects and briefly overlaps NY 79 before continuing northward through the valley and into Chenango County. NY 12 begins its 200+ mile journey here at US 11 just north of Binghamton in Chenango. Within Chenango County, NY 12 acts as the primary connector between the numerous communities located along the Chenango. In Greene, NY 12 intersects NY 206 and overlaps NY 41 for six blocks through the village before continuing northeast for to Oxford, where it intersects the eastern terminus of NY 220\\\\. After another , NY 12 enters the city of Norwich, becomes South Broad Street, and then intersects the western terminus of NY 990L (East Main Street). The South Broad moniker remains with the route northward through the city until the downtown district, where NY 12 turns into North Broad Street at a junction with NY 23\\\\. NY 12 loses the street name soon afterward as it leaves the city and intersects the western terminus of NY 320 north of Norwich and south of Norwich Lt. Warren Eaton Airport. The route and the Chenango River remain in close proximity to one another up through the village of Sherburne, where NY 12 intersects NY 80\\\\. North of the village center, the river breaks to the west, following NY 12B to the northwest while NY 12 continues northward into rural Madison County. =Madison and Oneida counties= NY 12 north at NY 315 in Waterville Across the county line, NY 12 joins the Sangerfield River as it heads north through the narrow southeastern portion of the county. Near the northern border of Madison County, the route shifts slightly east to bypass a marshy area around the Sangerfield River known as the Ninemile Swamp. The conditions persist into Oneida County to just south of the Sangerfield hamlet of the same name, where the swamp ends as the river curves away from NY 12\\\\. At the actual community, NY 12 intersects US 20. The route continues north for an additional to the village of Waterville, home to an intersection between NY 12 and NY 315\\\\. Outside of Waterville, NY 12 heads north once more through hilly, sparsely populated areas of New York toward Utica. In the Utica suburb of New Hartford, the route intersects Genesee Street (unsigned NY 921E), then NY 5 a short distance east of where NY 12B terminates at NY 5\\\\. NY 12 turns east, joining NY 5 northeast on a limited-access highway known locally as the North-South Arterial. Upon crossing into the Utica city limits, the Arterial intersects NY 8 and NY 840 by way of a cloverleaf interchange. NY 8 joins the freeway here, following NY 5 and NY 12 through southern Utica as the arterial meets French Road (unsigned NY 921W) and then Burrstone Road (unsigned NY 921B) by way of a pair of interchanges. After the Burrstone Road interchange, the arterial becomes a divided highway through downtown before becoming limited-access once more just past Noyes Street. After a short distance the highway intersects Court Street via a single point urban interchange then Oriskany Street (NY 5A and NY 5S). NY 12, 5 and 8 at the interchange with NY 5A and NY 5S Between Oriskany Street and the New York State Thruway (I-90), NY 5, 8, and 12 is part of the Interstate Highway System as I-790 overlaps all three routes northward over the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal before leaving the arterial at a large interchange on the north bank of the canal. NY 5 turns off as well, following I-790 eastward. Meanwhile, NY 8 and NY 12 interchange with NY 49 (the Utica- Rome Expressway), partially via the I-790 exit ramps, and passes over the Thruway before continuing northward out of the city limits. NY 8 and NY 12 remain limited-access as they proceed through the northern suburbs of Utica, connecting to Mulaney Road and Trenton Road via interchanges in Deerfield. Farther north in the town, NY 8 leaves the freeway by way of a trumpet interchange. Although the amount of development around NY 12 declines as it heads northward, it continues as an expressway to a point north of the Putnam Road interchange in Trenton, where the road reverts to a limited-access four- lane highway. This configuration remains through the villages of Barneveld, where NY 28 joins NY 12 south of the village, then intersects Mappa Avenue (unsigned NY 921D) in the village. From here NY 12 and NY 28 continues northward for a short distance and then connects to NY 365 via an interchange. From NY 365, it continues northward and intersects Steuben Street (unsigned NY 920V), the former NY 28B, east of the village of Remsen. From here NY 12 and NY 28 continue northward to the vicinity of Alder Creek in the town of Boonville, where NY 28 leaves NY 12 via a partial trumpet interchange and the road narrows to two lanes shortly afterward. Junction of NY 12 and NY 12D near Boonville From Alder Creek to Boonville, NY 12 loosely follows the path of the Black River as it heads northwest. Inside Boonville, NY 12D departs NY 12 and begins to follow a northward routing parallel to that of its parent. Together with NY 12D and the Black River, NY 12 passes into the region of New York known as the North Country. =North Country= The path of NY 12 through New York's North Country consists of three primary subregions: rural Lewis County, urban Watertown, and the numerous communities that line the southern bank of the St. Lawrence River, here the geographical divide between the United States and Canada. Lewis County NY 12, NY 12D, and the Black River continue to follow parallel routings north through the village of Port Leyden to Lyons Falls, where NY 12D returns to NY 12 just west of the village. Heading north NY 12 passes under NY 12D. Whereas NY 12D heads northeast from NY 12 on Cherry Street to access Lyons Falls before heading west over NY 12 and out of the village. NY 12 continues north along the vicinity of the Black River to Lowville, where NY 12 briefly overlaps NY 26 and meets NY 812 before leaving both the village and the river to the west. Roughly outside Lowville, at West Lowville, NY 12 leaves its due west alignment and curves to the northwest, with the westerly alignment continuing onward as NY 177\\\\. From here to the area surrounding Copenhagen, NY 12 passes through largely undeveloped terrain, save for a pair of isolated roadside communities. This trend ceases, albeit temporary, in the village of Copenhagen, located on the banks of the Deer River at the crossroads of NY 12 and the former NY 194 (now County Route 194 or CR 194). Outside the limits, the route resumes its trek through the rural North Country. Watertown area Approaching NY 126 on NY 12 northbound NY 12 enters Jefferson County on its way to Watertown just north of Copenhagen. NY 12 is known as Van Allen Road, crossing with Jefferson county roads in Rutland. At the intersection with CR 67, NY 12 turns to the north and enters Watertown as Gifford Street. NY 12 intersects with NY 126 just northeast of Thompson Park and Watertown Golf Club and turns to the northwest. As NY 12 continues through southern parts of Watertown, NY 3 intersects and becomes concurrent. NY 3 and NY 12 enter Watertown Public Square and split into divided highways. Here, NY 283 starts to the northeast. The eastern terminus of NY 12F is accessed via NY 12 southbound. NY 3 and NY 12 split, just northwest of the Public Square. NY 3 splits to the west, NY 12 heads to the northwest, and quickly becomes concurrent with US 11\\\\. The two roads cross a river and split in different directions. NY 12 heads to the northeast, intersecting with a suffixed route, NY 12E, and passes North Watertown Cemetery before connecting to I-81 at exit 47\\\\. NY 12 leaves Watertown afterwards and heads northeast through rural northwestern Jefferson County, along the way intersecting the western terminus of NY 342. North of Perch Lake in the southeastern corner of the town of Clayton, NY 12 intersects NY 180\\\\. From here, NY 12 continues approximately north and reaches the village of Clayton on the St. Lawrence River. On the south side of the village NY 12 intersects NY 12E and James Street (unsigned NY 970L), a loop through the village of Clayton. From here NY 12 turns east, intersects Webb Street (other end of unsigned 970L), then continues following State Street out of Clayton. St. Lawrence River NY 12 at NY 26's northern terminus NY 12 continues northeast along the south bank of the St. Lawrence, intersecting Mason Point Road (a local road leading to a Thousand Islands-bound ferry) and NY 180, and passing south of Grass Point State Park prior to encountering I-81, at exit 50, southwest of the village of Alexandria Bay. Farther northeast, NY 12 passes by Keewaydin State Park before intersecting the northern terminus of NY 26 and Church Street (unsigned NY 971K) in the southwestern portion of the village. The latter was a former northern extension of NY 26. Outside of Alexandria Bay, NY 12 temporarily turns east and leaves the riverbank to avoid Goose Bay, a small body of water partially separated from the St. Lawrence by two protruding points of land. The route then curves back toward the water and follows the eastern length of the bay, serving the seaside hamlet of Goose Bay near the bay's midpoint. North of Goose Bay, NY 12 intersects Kring Point Road, an access road leading to Kring Point State Park, and crosses into St. Lawrence County. NY 12 continues along the southern bank of the St. Lawrence River as it proceeds through the rural western portion of the county. In the town of Hammond, past the county line, NY 12 intersects CR 6, a roadway leading east to the village of Hammond and Black Lake. Farther north in Morristown, NY 12 travels through Jacques Cartier State Park before terminating at an interchange with NY 37 just south of the Morristown village limits. History =Origins= A section of the highway north of Utica was created as the Utica Turnpike. The company that built the turnpike was chartered in 1805 to build a road from the town of Deerfield to the town of Steuben. The road was opened in part in 1811, and was fully open in 1815. The road was sold off in 1848. =Designation= In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 8, an unsigned legislative route extending from Binghamton to Kirkland (west of Utica) via Greene, Norwich, Sherburne, Bouckville, and Oriskany Falls. Also assigned at this time was Route 25, which passed through Barneveld, Remsen and Forestport on its way from Whitesboro to Albany, and Route 27, which began at Route 25 in Forestport and went northwest to Alexandria Bay by way of Boonville, Potters Corners, Lowville, Carthage, Watertown, and Clayton. Route 25 originally went directly from Barneveld to Remsen; however, it was realigned by 1920 to serve the village of Prospect to the east. Former routing of NY 12 and 28 through Barneveld. Former NY 12 and 28 continued past where NY 365 turns west, now known as NY 921D When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, NY 12 was assigned to an alignment extending from Binghamton to Clayton via Norwich, Utica, and Watertown. It utilized legislative Route 8 from Binghamton to just south of Clinton, where it veered northeast to serve the city of Utica instead of continuing north on Route 6 (modern NY 233) to Kirkland. In the vicinity of Utica, NY 12 initially followed Clinton Road, Genesee Street, and Trenton Road through the city. Past Utica, it continued north on Trenton Road to a point south of Trenton (now Barneveld), where it briefly followed its current routing. NY 12 turned off again in Trenton to follow legislative Route 25's original alignment on Mappa Avenue in Trenton and Main Street in Remsen. NY 12 continued north from Remsen on legislative Route 25. At Forestport, NY 12 left Route 25 to follow legislative Route 27 to Lowville. In Lowville, NY 12 split from Route 27 and proceeded northwest to Watertown via Copenhagen, bypassing the slightly more circuitous route that Route 27 took via Carthage on modern NY 26, NY 126, and NY 3\\\\. NY 12 rejoined legislative Route 27 in Watertown and followed it to Clayton, where NY 12 ended at NY 3, which was also assigned in 1924. At the time, the segment of legislative Route 27 between Clayton and Alexandria Bay was designated as part of NY 3. =Realignments and terminus changes= The junction of NY 12 and NY 12B in Sherburne. At different points in the 1920s, the straight path carried NY 12 and NY 12A. In the late 1920s, NY 12 was realigned between Sherburne and Utica to follow a more direct alignment between the two locations via Sangerfield. Its former routing to the west became NY 12A (now NY 12B). As a result, NY 12 now entered Utica on Paris Road. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 3 was rerouted onto its current alignment east of Watertown while the former routing of NY 3 from Clayton to Alexandria Bay became an extension of NY 12. Also created as part of the renumbering was NY 12D, an alternate route of NY 12 between Potters Corners and Lowville via Lyons Falls.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering By the following year, NY 12D was rerouted south of Lyons Falls to follow a routing similar to modern NY 12 to Boonville. The alignments of NY 12 and NY 12D between the two villages were swapped , placing NY 12D on the direct highway between the two and NY 12 on the slightly more circuitous route via Lyons Falls. NY 12 originally extended southward into downtown Binghamton by way of an overlap with US 11. The overlap was eliminated at some point between 1947 and 1970. On its north end, NY 12 was extended northeast over a new roadway along the St. Lawrence River to NY 37 in Morristown in the mid-1960s. The Utica Arterial under construction in May 2015 In April 2014, work began on a $68.3 million project to replace the viaduct over Columbia Street, Lafayette Streets, and Oriskany Boulevard (NY 5A and NY 5S) in Utica. The nearly one mile stretch had signalized at- grade intersections that were causing safety concerns and some fatalities. In addition to the replacement of the viaduct, the alignment of the arterial was straightened, a new single point urban interchange was built at Court Street, and a pedestrian bridge was built across the roadway. The pedestrian bridge was opened by December 2014, and the remainder of the project was completed by October 2017. =Bypasses= Diagram of the interchange between I-790, NY 5, NY 8, NY 12 and NY 49 NY 12 has been realigned onto divided highways and limited-access highways over the years, particularly in Oneida County, to bypass communities along its routing. The first bypass that was constructed in Oneida County was around Remsen in the early 1950s. NY 12 was realigned onto the bypass, which passed to the west of the village, by 1954. Construction began by 1956 on a southward extension of the bypass that would take NY 12 around the eastern edge of Barneveld. It opened to traffic by 1958. Farther south, in Utica, a new limited-access highway was built through the downtown portion of the city in the early 1960s. At the time, it began at French Road and ended at Trenton Road. It became a realignment of NY 12 by 1964. An extension of the road southwest to Genesee Street in New Hartford was completed by 1968, at which time NY 12 was realigned to follow New Paris Road into the city. A limited-access highway bypassing Trenton Road and linking the Utica expressway and the Barneveld‚ÄìRemsen bypass was completed by 1973, resulting in the rerouting of NY 12 onto the roadway. The former routing of NY 12 along Trenton Road from the Utica city line to Powell Road is now CR 91. The route has also been realigned in areas to bypass smaller communities along the highway. One such location is in the vicinity of the village of Greene, where NY 12 initially followed Chenango Street through the village. The current bypass around the western edge of the village was built in the late 1970s and completed by 1981. Major intersections Suffixed routes NY 12 has had seven suffixed routes bearing six different designations. Two have since been removed and at least partially renumbered. All of the routes were assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York unless otherwise noted. *The NY 12A designation has been used for two distinct highways: **The first NY 12A was an alternate route of NY 12 between Sherburne and Utica.

SAR is analogous to the innate immune system found in animals, and although there are many shared aspects between the two systems, it is thought to be a result of convergent evolution.  Discovery  The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000).  Mechanism  Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors, these include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \\"pathogenesis-related\\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a molecular signal transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called NIM1, NPR1 or SAI1 (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system Arabidopsis thaliana.  Use in disease control  The synthetic fungicide acibenzolar-S-methyl induces SAR in the crop plants to which it is applied. It is a propesticide ‚Äî converted in-vivo into 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid by methyl salicylate esterase.

He is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. Life He was born in 1085 into a noble family of Vercelli in northwest Italy and brought up by a relation after the death of his parents. He undertook a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. On his pilgrimage to Compostela, William asked a blacksmith to make an iron implement that would encircle his body and increase his suffering, and he wore it throughout the pilgrimage.CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: William of Vercelli After he returned to Italy, he intended to go to Jerusalem and for this purpose he reached South Italy, but he was beaten up and robbed by thieves. William considered this misfortune a sign of God's will to stay in South Italy and spread the message of Christ. Because of this,istoria-montevergine p. 5 he decided not to travel to Jerusalem anymore and to settle in South Italy, on the summit of Monte Vergine (then known as Monte Vergiliana) between Nola and Benevento, where he lived as a hermit. Here he attracted a number of followers and founded the Monastery of Montevergine. While at Montevergine, William of Vercelli is stated as having performed miracles. Roger II of Sicily served as a patron to William, who founded many monasteries for men and women in Sicily. The Catholic Encyclopedia states that Roger built a monastery opposite his palace at Salerno in order to have William always near him. The inflow of the faithful was for the priests the opportunity to exercise their ministry, and the hermit life that William sought was compromised. Moreover, his confreres did not tolerate that lifestyle too austere and full of privations.istoria- montevergine p. 11 Therefore, he left Montevergine in 1128 and settled on the plains in Goleto, in the territory of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi, between Campania and Basilicata, where he began a new monastic experience, a double monastery built mostly by women. Subsequently, he founded several other monasteries of the same rule, but mostly remained in Goleto except for some trips to Apulia. Eventually he died in Goleto on June 25, 1142. His remains were buried in Goleto, where they stayed until they were transferred to Montevergine on September 2, 1807, as ordered by the king of Naples Gioacchino Murat. Some of his relics are also located in other cathedrals (Benevento) and Italian churches. Catholic tradition states that William foresaw his own imminent death \\"by special revelation\\". The Abbey of San Guglielmo al Goleto. Sources The most reliable source concerning William of Vercelli's life is the Legenda de vita et obitu sancti Guilielmi Confessoris et heremitae, written in the first half of the 13th century, thus shortly thereafter. The remaining later sources contain corrupt or even invented accounts on his life, therefore they are unreliable although not necessarily false, as primary sources may have been lost. The Miracle of the Wolf According to all the sources, including the earliest source, \\"Legenda de vita et obitu sancti Guilielmi Confessoris et heremitae\\", all of which are close to Catholicism, he performed many miracles. The best-known miracle was and still is the \\"Miracle of the Wolf\\" (1591). Because of this, he is often depicted in company with a \\"domesticated\\" wolf, even in the monastery of Montevergine.istoria- montevergine p. 9 One day a wolf hunted and killed a donkey the saint used for towing and other tasks. The saint then turned to the wolf and ordered the beast to offer himself to do all the donkey's previous tasks. The wild beast reportedly became tame, and the people who met the saint were astonished to see such a docile wolf. At king Roger II's court Hagiographer Tommaso Costo (1591) wrote that king Roger II of Sicily had heard about William of Montevergine, and thus he wanted to meet him. The king reportedly was living in Salerno at that time.istoria-montevergine p. 19 Reportedly, while visiting the king, a prostitute wanted to prove the genuineness of his faith, and, complicit with the king, tried to get into William of Montevergine's bed who, in response, put burning embers on his bed and there he lay down, inviting the prostitute to follow his example. Reportedly the woman repented of her mistake and switched to a more religious life.istoria-montevergine p. 19-21 Posthumous sources add further details, stating that the prostitute had been called Agnes and that, after conversion, she had built a monastery in Venosa, where she led a monastic life with other women, being called \\"Blessed Agnes of Venosa\\". Hagiographer Tommaso Costo, as early as in the 16th century, dismissed the second part of the story, there being no mention of it in the main and most reliable source, the Legenda de vita et obitu sancti Guilielmi Confessoris et heremitae.istoria-montevergine p. 22 See also * Abbey of San Guglielmo al Goleto References Bibliography  * The Book of Saints, compiled by the Benedictine monks of St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate.

Background  Ferrari 288 GTO rear view Rear view of a Ferrari 288 GTO.Contrary to what is reported historically in the press, the Ferrari GTO was not immediately born to compete in the new 1982 Group B Circuit Race series; Enzo Ferrari did not have overall control of the Road Car division, which was at the time managed by the General Director Eugenio Alzati and the FIAT MD (CEO) Vittorio Ghidella. In 1983 Mr Ferrari noted from discussions with close friends and clients that the road car sales were falling due to stronger competition from rival car makers and what he described as the \\"excessive gentrification\\" of the Ferrari model lineup.  Turbocharging: from F1 to road cars  The success of turbocharging in Formula 1 and the introduction of some new tax laws (above the 1999cc displacement threshold) had prompted Ferrari to first build the 208 Turbo and then discuss turbocharging also in 3 litre form for a road car which could produce 330 bhp. The first 208 turbo did not feature an intercooler so the performance and reliability was somewhat delicate due to high combustion temperatures. Ferrari approached the head of powertrain for the Gestione Sportiva (Racing Division), Nicola Materazzi, to give an opinion on the proposed specification for the new 3L turbo engine. Materazzi had joined from Osella in 1979 (before then at Lancia Reparto Corse) due to his experience with forced induction and had been involved in the 126 F1 car experimentation between Comprex and turbo. When Materazzi showed confidence that 400 bhp could be reliably extracted from 3000cc (133 bhp/litre), Ferrari placed his trust in him on condition that it would deliver as promised. Ferrari also jokingly suggested that Materazzi work on the 268 engine destined for the Lancia LC2 Group C racing car, due to similarities in displacement and mechanical parts.  Development  The Ferrari F114B road-car engine and the Lancia 2.6L V8 race engine developments progressed closely, with some draughtsmen employed from Abarth to complete detail design on components for manufacture at times when the Ferrari draughtsmen were at full capacity. In order to improve overall performance, several key aspects of the original 308 vehicle layout were altered: the engine did not grow in displacement but was turbocharged, it remained mid- mounted but now longitudinally instead of transversely, the wheelbase was elongated by 200mm, the outer bodywork required modifications to maintain pleasing proportions. The car used water-cooled IHI turbochargers from japan compared to the KKK turbochargers used in Formula 1 due to the better materials and aerodynamic internal designs which allowed faster transient response. IHI had bought patents from Swiss manufacturer Brown Boveri (Baden) that had supplied Ferrari with the Comprex systems. Some of the GTO's styling features were first displayed on a 308 GTB design exercise by Pininfarina shown at the 1977 Geneva Auto Salon. The 288 GTO had started out as a modified version of the 308/328 to hold down costs and to build the car quickly, but little of the 308/328 was left when the 288 GTO was finished. Fortunately Ferrari could count on customers who were loyal when it came to spending more if they could access performance and style that was unmatched, so the unplanned deviation from the original cost targets did not necessarily prove an issue. Easily noticeable differences were the GTOs bulging fender flares, larger front/rear spoilers, large \\"flag-style\\" outside mirrors and four driving lights at the far sides of the grille. Retained from the original 250 GTO were slanted air vents, put in the GTO's rear fenders to cool the brakes, as well as the rear wing's design, borrowed from the 250 GTO's original wing. The GTO also had wider body panels than the 308's because they had to cover much larger Goodyear tires mounted on racing wheels. The suspension's height could be set higher for road use and lower for racing on tracks. Bodywork material was new and lighter for better acceleration and handling. The GTO's weight was , compared to for the 308/328. Steel was used just for the doors because major body panels were made from molded fiberglass. Kevlar was used for the hood, and the roof was made from Kevlar and carbon fiber. Materazzi felt that with the latest road speed limits and stricter fines, it was increasingly hard for clients to really prove the potential of cars with a high performance. Ferrari asked what was his proposal, to which he suggested returning to racing in the GT class, something which had been interrupted after the 512 BB LM. The overall permission to modify the GTO road car into the Evoluzione for a racing programme however had to be ratified by Eugenio Alzati. He permitted it on conditions that the engineers interested in the project work outside of the Monday to Friday timetable (which was dedicated for development of 328 and other models). The lessons learnt during the development of the engine for the Lancia LC2 could be applied to the racing version of the GTO, such as the carefully engineered conicity of the intake plenums to ensure accurately balanced air flow and pressure to each cylinder and the setup of the turbochargers to produce in excess of 650 bhp. The GTO Evoluzione included all the necessary modifications (bodywork, chassis, safety systems) to comply with the FIA regulations which permitted 20 cars per year to be specifically built for rally or track racing. Due to multiple deaths and the inherent danger involved with group B rally racing, the Group B Circuit series was suspended at the end of 1986. As a result, the GTO Evo never raced. All GTO road cars came in a stock red color, except one which was black. All GTO Evo cars came in red colour. Like any Ferrari car, the low production numbers for the GTO were intended to give an exclusive product for the enthusiast buyer. The number of GTO's produced did indeed fit in the minimum requirement of 200 required by the FIA and in fact the factory produced 70 more plus a couple extra to please the Agnelli family, an F1 driver or anybody else who the Commendatore predicted might insist on a last minute purchase option. Although the production car test team - headed by Dario Benuzzi - did not include any of the Formula 1 drivers, Michele Alboreto occasionally had involvement in giving feedback on cars such as the 288 GTO, and later the 328 Turbo and F40. In particular he agreed with Enzo Ferrari's return to a breed of cars which were much more fiery, describing the GTO as \\"cattiva\\" (angry) and praising its low engine centre of gravity compared to the Testarossa.  Engine  The GTO was based on the rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive 308 GTB, which has a V8. The \\"288\\" refers to the GTO's 2.8 litre DOHC 4 valves per cylinder V8 engine as it used a de-bored by with IHI twin-turbochargers, Behr air-to-air intercoolers, Weber-Marelli fuel injection and a compression ratio of 7.6:1. The 2.85 litre engine capacity was dictated by the FIA's requirement for a turbocharged engine's capacity to be multiplied by 1.4. This gave the GTO an equivalent engine capacity of , just under the Group B limit of 4.0 litres. Unlike the 308's engine, the GTO's V8 was mounted longitudinally, using the 308's rear trunk space. This was necessary to make room for the twin turbochargers and intercoolers. The racing transmission was mounted to the rear of the longitudinal engine, moving the rear differential and wheels aft. The arrangement also let the GTO use a more conventional race-car engine/transmission layout for such things as quick gear-ratio changes for various tracks. As a result, the wheelbase was longer at . The track was also widened to accommodate wider wheels and tires (Goodyear NCT 225/55 VR16 tires mounted on 8 x 16 inch Speedline wheels at the front and 255/50 VR16 (265/50 VR16 for U.S. models) mounted on 10 x 16 inch wheels at the rear) to provide increased cornering and braking performance and the ability to apply at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 3,800 rpm. The GTO could accelerate from 0- in around 5 seconds and Ferrari claimed 0- in 15 seconds flat and a top speed of , making it one of the fastest street-legal production cars of its time.

Excerpt:  Evoluzione  1987 Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione. Ferrari built six (five production models and one prototype) 288 GTO Evoluzione models with more aggressive and aerodynamic body styling and increased power. The Evoluzione, introduced in 1986, was built to race in Group B but when that series was cancelled the project was also shelved as it was not fit for any other racing series. Ferrari had planned a production run of 20 cars to comply with Group B homologation requirements for Evolution models. The 288 GTO Evoluzione is powered by an upgraded version of the 2.9 L V8 used in the normal 288 GTO that has twin-turbochargers and produces at 7,800 rpm. It has a weight of around and can reach a top speed of . It features a unique front end designed for aerodynamics with front canards, channels and vents as well as a large carbon fibre rear spoiler and numerous large NACA ducts. Many styling and mechanical elements from the Evoluzione influenced the soon to follow F40. All six are thought to still be in existence with one owned by the Factory on display in the engine manufacturing facility in Maranello and another suspected to have been used as a prototype during the development of the F40.  Formula 1 GTO owners Several Formula 1 drivers were offered GTOs by Enzo Ferrari. These include Michele Alboreto (56195), Keke Rosberg (56653) and Niki Lauda (58329), who was gifted the last of the 272 units built, by Enzo Ferrari himself.

History Marshak was born in the Bronx, New York City. His parents, Harry and Rose Marshak, were immigrants from Minsk. He went to the City College of New York for one semester and then \\"received a Pulitzer Scholarship which provided full tuition and a stipend which allowed him to continue his education at Columbia University.\\" In 1939, Marshak received his Ph.D. from Cornell University. Along with his thesis advisor, Hans Bethe, he discovered many of the fusion aspects involved in star formation. This helped him on his work for the Manhattan Project, in Los Alamos, during World War II. In 1947, at the Shelter Island Conference, Marshak presented his two-meson hypothesis about the pi- meson, which were discovered shortly thereafter. In 1957, he and George Sudarshan proposed a V-A (\\"vector\\" minus \\"axial vector\\") Lagrangian for weak interactions, which was later presented by Richard Feynman and Murray Gell- Mann. It is known that Murray Gell-Mann had learned the theory from George Sudarshan. Similarly, Richard Feynman learned about the theory from a discussion with Marshak in a conference. \\"Perhaps Marshak's most significant scientific contribution was the proposal of the V-A Theory of Weak Interactions (the fourth force in nature) in collaboration with his student George Sudarshan. Unfortunately, the pair published the theory only in a conference proceedings for a meeting in Italy. Six months later, a different derivation of the same concept was published by Feynman and Gell-Mann in a mainstream scientific journal. Marshak had talked with Feynman about the general problem in California some time before. Though the V-A Concept was considered to be one of the most important contributions to theoretical physics, a Nobel Prize was never awarded for it.\\" Sudarshan commented in a 2006 TV interview that Murray Gell-Mann got the idea from him during an informal coffee time. From 1956 to 1970, he was chairman of the University of Rochester Department of Physics. From 1970 to 1979, he was president of the City College of New York. Marshak shared the 1982 J.

In certain countries they are announced by the head of government or a minister of the parliament. In constitutional monarchies, this function may be fulfilled by the Speech from the Throne. In Germany and Austria, the Chancellor submits a government policy statement (Regierungserkl√§rung) at the beginning of the session of the Bundestag (in Austria: Nationalrat), in which they announces the intended policies of the government during the next legislative session. The statement is not legally binding, but is a significant constitutional commitment for the parliament and the government. During the legislative period the federal government, through the Chancellor and the ministers, can give statements to the parliament through the chancellor or the ministers concerning current political themes. It cannot however be obliged to give such statements. In Belgium, the federal government holds its policy statement (Beleidsverklaring) on the second Wednesday in October; its northern region of Flanders states its September Declaration (Septemberverklaring) on the fourth Monday of September. In the Netherlands, every third Tuesday in September is Prinsjesdag: the king holds the Speech from the throne (Troonrede) and the government will state its policy and budget plans in the Budget Memorandum (Miljoenennota) for the next year. When a new government coalition has been formed after elections, the Prime Minister will make a similar statement (Regeringsverklaring) for the four year legislative period it intends to run the country. In Sweden, the Prime Minister holds the government's statement (Regeringsf√∂rklaring) at the start of their government's legislative session and at the start of each parliamentary year.

It is traditionally dated to the year 634, and was the only major Sassanian victory over the invading Muslim armies. Context The Muslim forces had already taken Hira and assumed control of the surrounding Arab-inhabited areas of Mesopotamia, on the banks of the Euphrates. The fall of Hira shocked the Persians, as the \\"youthful Yazdgard, began to take the business of the Arabs more seriously.\\" Yazdgard sent forces to the Arab border areas, and looked to be gaining the upper hand, as Al-Muthanna had to call for reinforcements from Medina. The new Caliph, Umar, sent Abu Ubaid to Mesopotamia to take command from Al-Muthanna. He encountered the main Persian force under Bahman Jaduya, near what is the present site of Kufa. The two forces faced each other on opposing banks of the Euphrates. As it was crossed by a bridge, the battle came to known as the Battle of the Bridge. Battle Bahman invited Abu Ubayd to decide who should cross the river. The latter took the initiative, and crossed the river aggressively; this proved to be disastrous. According to accounts, the sight of the elephants in the Persian army frightened the Arabs' horses. A white elephant apparently tore Abu Ubaid from his horse with its trunk, and trampled him under foot. At this, and the inability of the Arab troops to push back the Persians who had formed a rigid line close to the bridge, the Arabs panicked and fled. After Abu Ubayd the command was taken by al-Hakam and Jabr, his brother and son, respectively, and eventually al-Muthanna. According to tradition, Al-Muthanna remained to fight so that the Arabs could repair the bridge and flee losing 4,000 men, - although any accurate estimates of the figures involved in this and other contemporaneous battles are not known. Around 3,000 Arab Muslims were carried away by the river. Sources agree that for whatever reason, Bahman Jaduya did not pursue the fleeing Arab army.

It was introduced shortly before 190 B.C. at that city to provide the Attalid kingdom with a substitute for Seleucid coins and the tetradrachms of Philetairos. It was also used by a number of other cities that were under Attalid control. These cities included Alabanda and Kibyra. It continued to be minted and circulated down to the time of Hadrian, long after the kingdom was bequeathed to Rome. It owes its name to a figure, on the obverse, of the sacred chest () of Dionysus. Cistophoric standard It was tariffed at four drachmas, but weighed only as much as three Attic drachmas (the most important weight standard of the time), 12.75 grams. In addition, the evidence of hoards suggests that it did not travel outside the area which Pergamum controlled. It is therefore suspected that it was overvalued in this area. In any case, the result was a closed monetary system similar to that in the Ptolemaic Kingdom. It is likely that this was a deliberate policy. Design and themes Cistophoric coinage fails to portray reigning kings in its coins. It is possible that this lack of royal iconography is the result of Attalid royal ideology. The royal coinage is mimicking itself as a federal coinage. Attalid kings were unable to portray themselves as a charismatic and militaristic authority like the other Hellenistic rulers, as the kingdom during reign of Eumenes II received much of its power practically as a Roman gift. He portrayed himself as a benefactor of the Greeks living within Asia Minor. The types reflect the Attalid kings' claims of descent from Dionysus and Heracles.Kenneth W.

Biography Bardin was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, where his father was a well-to-do coal merchant and his mother an office worker. Nearly all of his immediate family died of various illnesses, however, with an elder sister dying of septicaemia, and, a year later, his father succumbing to a coronary and leaving little money. Bardin, who by then had graduated from Walnut Hills High School, was studying engineering at the University of Cincinnati, and had to leave in his first year in order to work full-time as a ticket-taker and bouncer at a roller-skating rink, and later as a night clerk at a bookstore, where he would educate himself by reading.Symons, Bardin biographical capsule, p. 1 (unnumbered) \\"Mother had become a paranoid schizophrenic by then,\\" Bardin said. \\"It was on visits to her that I first had an insight into the 'going home' hallucinations\\" that would later form the core of his third novel, Devil Take the Blue-Tail Fly. Other jobs, held in some combination of Cincinnati and New York City, to which he moved before turning 30, including working as a bench hand in a valve foundry; in the advertising department of a bank; in the production department of an advertising agency; and doing freelance market research for Barron Collier. In New York, he began working in 1944 for the ad agency Edwin Bird Wilson, Inc., and from 1946 to 1948 completed the three novels for which he would be best known: The Deadly Percheron, The Last of Philip Banter, and Devil Take the Blue-Tail Fly, published over the course of 18 months, though that last not in the United States until the 1960s. Bardin would eventually write 10 novels over the course of his lifetime. His magazine articles include \\"The Disadvantages of Respectability\\", a review of the book Father of the Man: How Your Child Gets His Personality, by W. Allison Davis and Robert J. Havighurst, in The Nation, May 3, 1947. Full article available to subscribers; otherwise, abstract only and article for purchase. Print article available via libraries. After gradually rising to become vice president and director of Edwin Bird Wilson, Bardin left that agency in 1963. Two years earlier he had begun teaching creative writing and advertising at the New School for Social Research, which he would continue to do through 1966. That year he worked as associate publicity director for the United Negro College Fund, and from 1967 to 1968, he wrote for the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York. Turning to magazines, he then served as an editor at Coronet through 1972. For the next two years at least, Bardin lived in Chicago, Illinois, where he served as managing editor of the American Medical Association magazine Today's Health through 1973; and through 1974 originated, and served as managing editor of, two American Bar Association Press magazines, Learning and the Law and Barrister. While his official site states he returned to New York in 1974, one source places him in Chicago still in 1978. He resided in New York City's East Village. He died on July 9, 1981 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, New York City. He was survived by his second wife, Phyllida. Legacy As of at least 2010, Bardin's copyrights are held by Franklin C. Bardin and Judith A. Bardin, a.k.a. Judith Aycock, his children from his first marriage. Novels In 1946, Bardin entered a period of intense creativity during which he wrote three crime novels that were relatively unsuccessful at first, one of them not even being published in America until the late 1960s, but which have since become well-regarded cult novels. He went on to write four more novels under the pen names Gregory Tree or Douglas Ashe; the writer Julian Symons, in his introduction to an omnibus collection of Bardin's first three works, called those later novels \\"slick, readable, unadventurous crime stories\\". Under his own name, Bardin also wrote three more novels, the first two of which Symons called, respectively, \\"an interesting but unsuccessful experiment\\" and \\"disastrously sentimental\\". His best-regarded works, The Deadly Percheron, The Last of Philip Banter and Devil Take the Blue-Tail Fly experienced renewed interest in the 1970s when they were discovered by British readers. As Symons said of their reemergence: Symons, who compiled the omnibus, had difficulty tracking down information on Bardin. He was unable to find any American critic who had heard of him and even his original publishers and agents did not know how to contact him or even whether he was still alive. Symons wrote that Third Degree, the journal of Mystery Writers of America, found Bardin in Chicago, editing an American Bar Association magazine, and willing and eager to see his work republished. The Deadly Percheron tells the story of a psychiatrist who encounters a patient with apparent delusions and a strange story to tell, but who does not otherwise exhibit signs of mental instability. His story turns out to have at least some connection to reality, drawing the psychiatrist into a complicated alternate identity that changes his life. The Last of Philip Banter sees a man receiving (or apparently writing) disturbing predictions about his life. The predictions partly become true, the effect of the predictions themselves being destructive and mind-altering. Devil Take the Blue-Tail Fly, perhaps his most acclaimed work, is a complicated story told almost entirely in terms of the psychology of the protagonist Ellen, a mental patient who experiences mental disintegration. Bardin gave his literary influences as Graham Greene, Henry Green and Henry James. In the film Mona Lisa one of the characters is reading The Deadly Percheron and makes several conversational references to it.

The family moved to Katherine in the Northern Territory when Pat was two, to escape Western Australian laws banning race-mix families. The Dodson children were orphaned at the deaths of both parents only three months apart in 1960. He and his brother Mick were made wards of the state, but their aunt and uncle decided they should accept a scholarship to study at Monivae College in Hamilton, Victoria, where Dodson became head prefect and captain of football. After completing his schooling, Patrick enrolled to study for the priesthood at Corpus Christi College, Melbourne, and was ordained in the order of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart in May 1975. He was the first Aboriginal person to become a Catholic priest in Australia. He left the priesthood in the early 1980s due to conflict over the balance and blend of Catholicism and Aboriginal spiritual belief.

Publication history The New Adventures of Hitler was a satirical and surreal (one scene has Hitler opening a cupboard to find Morrissey singing \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\") strip based on the claims of Hitler's sister-in-law Bridget Dowling that Hitler had lived with her, her husband Alois Hitler, Jr., and her son William Patrick Hitler in Liverpool from 1912 to 1913. It first appeared in Cut, a Scottish arts and culture magazine and became instantly controversial, and some accused Morrison of being a Nazi due to his use of Hitler in what was essentially a humorous story. Cut ceased publication before the entire strip was published, but The New Adventures of Hitler was printed in its entirety in Crisis in 1990. Crisis was a spin-off from 2000 AD which printed more adult-oriented work and The New Adventures of Hitler fit in with the themes of the magazine. However the controversy which had surrounded the story in Cut continued with the strip's reprinting in Crisis. The story ran from Crisis in issues 46-49 and a proposed collected edition by IPC never appeared. Morrison himself had planned to set up his own imprint to self- publish some of his work, including The New Adventures of Hitler, but nothing came of the idea.

Description Copic markers are available in 358 non-toxic, alcohol-based ink colours and are refillable using standard colours ink refills. The refill inks can be mixed to create custom colours, and empty markers are sold for this purpose. The markers are airtight to prevent them from drying out. Sketch markers, which are the most popular version, have a chisel-style tip at one end and a brush tip at the other, though additional styles of replaceable nibs and tips are available. The company also sells an airbrush system which utilizes either an air compressor or canned air to blow ink off the tips of the markers onto the paper.  History  In 1987, the initial classic line of Copic Markers was introduced in Japan with the manga industry in mind. A total of 71 colours were launched and were developed to meet designers‚Äô demand for photocopy-safe markers. The markers would not dissolve the toner of freshly- printed photocopies, and in turn the markers were given the name Copic, deriving from the word ‚Äúcopies‚Äù. In 1989, an additional 71 colours were added to the line, adding a set of more neutral tones and grays to the marker‚Äôs library. These additional tones were created to accommodate for architectural design and figure painting. In 1991, 72 new colours were added to meet the need to design environments and fashion. In 1993, Copic Sketch was introduced with an assortment of 144 colours. These markers featured a Super Brush Nib, a brush that revolutionized fine art markers with its nib durability and long- lasting lifespan. The Copic Sketch has since become the most widely sought- after marker from the company. In 1998, the Copic Ciao marker was introduced. The line was released with 72 colours and was an inexpensive pack designed for beginners. Since 1999 many new colours were added to the line of Copic Sketch to meet the success of the markers and the expansion of the manga market. Many colours introduced to the Copic Sketch line included flesh tones, pastels, fluorescents and many more.  Copic Marker Types  = Classic (Original) = These are available in 214 colours with nine different tip options, including: two calligraphy tips, two types of broad tips, and a range of fine nibs. They come with a chisel nib and a bullet nib on each side. = Sketch = These markers are available in all of the 358 colours offered with a brush nib and a chisel-shaped nib. They have an oval barrel. They are compatible with the Copic Airbrush System. These are the most popular marker from Too Corporation. = Ciao = These are available in 180 colours. They have a brush nib, a chisel nib, and a circular barrel. They are smaller than Copic's other markers and are designed to be a more affordable option. = Wide = The wide markers were available in 36 colours, had a wide chisel-shaped nib and a large oval shaped barrel. They have been used for large backgrounds as well as calligraphy. Too Corporation has discontinued the production of coloured Copic Wide in 2016, but Copic Wide Original (empty marker) continues to be sold. = Refill = Copic markers come with the ability to refill dry markers with Copic ink refills instead of having to buy additional markers in the same colours. Tutorials for how to refill a Copic marker can be found on YouTube. It is also possible to mix the ink colours to create a custom colours.  Copic Marker Nib Shapes  = Super Brush Nib = Super brush nibs are the most versatile. Similar to a brush (hence the name), you can alternate between thick and thin strokes depending on the amount of pressure you apply. Copic Sketch and Ciao Markers come with a brush tip, whereas Copic Classics do not (you can however install a brush tip on a Copic Original Marker). = Broad Nib = Copic‚Äôs broad nib is chiselled, letting you create different stroke widths with its versatile surfaces. Though not as versatile as the super brush nib (Broad Tip strokes look a lot more precise compared to the Super Brush Nibs artistic strokes) its great for laying down flat colour and creating strong shading lines (useful for anime style shading). All Copic Markers come with a broad nib end. Keep in mind that the Broad Nib on Copic Classics are larger than their Copic Sketch and Ciao counterparts. Due to this you‚Äôll need to be careful when buying replacement nibs. If you buy a medium- sized broad nib for your Copic Classic it‚Äôs not going to fit. = Fine Nib = Fine nibs are great for adding small detail to your work. While only Copic Classic Markers are equipped with these, you can buy fine nibs for sketch markers if you want to alternate between the fine nib and super brush.  Copic Colour Coding System  The Copic Colour Coding System can be found on the base of the marker, as well as on the caps of the classic and sketch markers. = Copic Colour Wheel = The letter(s) on your marker represents the colour family it falls into. There are currently 16 Copic Marker colour families:  Chromatic Colours (and Fluorescent Colour)  *R - Red *B - Blue *Y - Yellow *G - Green *V - Violet (Purple) *YR - Yellow-Red (Orange) *BG - Blue-Green (Teal/Turquoise) *YG - yellow-green family *BV - Blue-Violet *RV - Red-Violet (Pink) *E - Earth Tones (Brown) * F - Fluorescent/Neon colours  Gray Tones  *N - Neutral Gray *C - Cool Gray *W - Warm Gray *T - Toner Gray  Achromatic Colours  * 1 - Black Copic Markers are represented by number only: 100, and 110 for special (rich) black. *0 - Colourless Blender Markers are coded with a single 0 as they contains alcohol- based fluid with no pigment. = Colour Saturation (Blending Group) = Following the letter is the first number. The first digit represents the level of saturation of the Copic Marker. This number ranges between 0- 9, with 0 being the purest form of colour and 9 being most desaturated (with the highest level of gray). = Colour Value (Shade/Intensity) = The last digit(s) on Copic Markers represent a marker's colour intensity (aka how bright that colour is). These numbers are split between 12 levels (000, 00 and 0-9). Markers that fall closer to the 0 range are lighter in value, and become darker the closer they shift toward 9. Markers that are 000 and 00 in nature are often more transparent as they have a higher concentration of colourless blender alcohol-based fluid.  Pens  Copic sells 4 different types of pens. Multiliners are disposable artist pen that come in 10 colours and 10 tip sizes. Multiliner SP is a more premium version of the Multiliners that have aluminum bodies and replaceable nibs and ink (SP is available only in black). = Multiliner = These are available in 10 colours. They have a nib which their website describes as \\"perfect\\" for illustration, design, and comics. The multiliners also have an \\"SP\\" version, which is available in various colours. Its ink is water-proof and copic-proof. = Gasenfude = Gasenfude has a synthetic brush nib able to create a wide range of lines. These are only available in black, with a brush nib. The ink is waterproof and copic-proof, which does not smudge when copic ink is applied over the line. = Drawing Pen = The Drawing Fountain pen has 2 different sizes and 2 different colours. These are available in black and sepia, each with a nib comparable to that of a fountain pen. The ink is water-proof and copic ink-proof.  Copic Airbrush System  The airbrush system uses disposable cans of compressed air, or air from a compressor, to spray ink from Copic Original and Sketch markers onto a surface. Airbrushing uses less ink than direct colouring since saturating the paper isn't necessary.

They are usually known as Kaplansky's conjectures. Group rings Let be a field, and a torsion-free group. Kaplansky's zero divisor conjecture states: * The group ring does not contain nontrivial zero divisors, that is, it is a domain. Two related conjectures are: * does not contain any non-trivial idempotents, i.e., if , then or . * does not contain any non-trivial units, i.e., if in , then for some in and in . The zero-divisor conjecture implies the idempotent conjecture and is implied by the unit conjecture. As of 2019, all three are open, though there are positive solutions for large classes of groups for both the idempotent and zero-divisor conjectures. For example, the zero-divisor conjecture is known to hold for all virtually solvable groups and more generally also for all residually torsion-free solvable groups. These solutions go through establishing first the conclusion to the Atiyah conjecture on L^2-Betti numbers, from which the zero-divisor conjecture easily follows. The idempotent conjecture has a generalisation, the Kadison idempotent conjecture, also known as the Kadison-Kaplansky conjecture, for elements in the reduced group C*-algebra. In this setting, it is known that if the Farrell‚ÄìJones conjecture holds for , then so does the idempotent conjecture. The latter has been positively solved for an extremely large class of groups, including for example all hyperbolic groups. The unit conjecture is also known to hold in many groups but its partial solutions are much less robust than the other two. For example, there is a torsion-free 3-dimensional crystallographic group for which it is not known whether all units are trivial. This conjecture is not known to follow from any analytic statement like the other two, and so the cases where it is known to hold have all been established via a direct combinatorial approach involving the so-called unique products property. Banach algebras This conjecture states that every algebra homomorphism from the Banach algebra C(X) (continuous complex-valued functions on X, where X is a compact Hausdorff space) into any other Banach algebra, is necessarily continuous. The conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every algebra norm on C(X) is equivalent to the usual uniform norm. (Kaplansky himself had earlier shown that every complete algebra norm on C(X) is equivalent to the uniform norm.) In the mid-1970s, H. Garth Dales and J. Esterle independently proved that, if one furthermore assumes the validity of the continuum hypothesis, there exist compact Hausdorff spaces X and discontinuous homomorphisms from C(X) to some Banach algebra, giving counterexamples to the conjecture. In 1976, R. M. Solovay (building on work of H. Woodin) exhibited a model of ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory + axiom of choice) in which Kaplansky's conjecture is true. Kaplansky's conjecture is thus an example of a statement undecidable in ZFC. Quadratic forms In 1953, Kaplansky proposed the conjecture that finite values of u-invariants can only be powers of 2. In 1989, the conjecture was refuted by Alexander Merkurjev who demonstrated fields with u-invariants of any even m. In 1999, Oleg Izhboldin built a field with u-invariant m=9 that was the first example of an odd u-invariant. In 2006, Alexander Vishik demonstrated fields with u-invariant m=2^k+1 for any integer k starting from 3. References * H. G. Dales, Automatic continuity: a survey. Bull. London Math.

Retrieved: July 31, 2013. was a Swedish author, poet, and composer. A nom de plume he sometimes used was Black Jim. Although he is counted among the Swedish proletarian authors, his works are not limited to that genre. Early life Born in Grang√§rde parish in the province of Dalarna, Andersson grew up under harsh conditions in the village of Skattl√∂sberg. His father Adolf was a primary school teacher there, and his mother Augusta had also taught in the local school. The village lies in the \\"Finn Woods\\" of southern Dalarna, where Forest Finns had immigrated to cultivate new land. On his father's side, Andersson descended from these Finnish settlers. Andersson took odd jobs during the first years of his life, for instance as a forestry worker and school teacher. He found it difficult to make a living. The family considered trying to find a better life in the United States, and Andersson was sent to live in Forest Lake, Minnesota as a 14-year-old in 1902 to see if it would be possible. But he wrote to them, saying that there were no better opportunities there than in Sweden, upon which his father asked him to come home. The family moved from Skattl√∂sberg in 1905, but Andersson returned there to live with his parents and siblings 1911-1915. During this period, he wrote a number of stories and poems. Large parts of his Kolarhistorier and Kolvaktarens visor were probably created during this time. In 1918 Andersson married primary school teacher Olga Turesson, the sister of troubadour Gunnar Turesson. Brunnsvik During the years 1914-1915, Andersson studied at the Brunnsvik folk high school, with, among others, future authors Harry Blomberg and Ragnar J√§ndel. He was also a good friend of Karl L√§rka, who would become a well-known documentary photographer. From this time onwards he was to become active as an author, writing poems and songs about his home region, which are read and sung almost a century later in Swedish homes. Gunde Johansson and Thorstein Bergman are among the best known of his interpreters. Andersson also set some of his lyrics to music ‚Äî most notably Till min syster (\\"To My Sister\\") and Jungman Jansson (\\"Sailor apprentice Jansson\\") ‚Äî and played the accordion and violin. He was a co-worker at the Social Democratic newspaper Ny Tid in Gothenburg 1917-1918, and he also translated texts by Rudyard Kipling and Charles Baudelaire into Swedish. Despite his simple upbringing, Andersson was highly educated. Death Dan Andersson died in room 11 at Hotel Hellman in Stockholm on 16 September 1920, where he had gone to look for a job at the newspaper Social-Demokraten. The hotel staff had used hydrogen cyanide against bedbugs and hadn't cleared the room as prescribed. At 3 p.m. Andersson was found dead. At the same time, insurance inspector Elliott Eriksson from Bolln√§s also died. The hotel was located at Bryggaregatan 5 in Stockholm, but it was demolished in the 1960s. Andersson is buried at Lyviken Cemetery in Ludvika. Legacy Dan Andersson bust in Gothenburg Dan Andersson's poetry enjoys a broad popularity among the Swedish people because of its naturalist mysticism and searching for God. In 2005, Sofia Karlsson recorded a new interpretation of Andersson's songs, which received a Grammy award in both Sweden and Denmark, and before that time his poems had been sung by a number of artists, including the Hootenanny Singers, Love Explosion, and Fred √Ökerstr√∂m. Joakim Th√•str√∂m has also referenced Andersson in a number of his songs. In 1988, at the centenary of Andersson's birth, Posten, the Swedish postal service, published two stamps in his honour. In Ludvika, a Dan Andersson week is celebrated the first week of every August. In Ludvika there is also a Dan Andersson museum and a statue of him. A bust is also to be found at J√§rntorget in Gothenburg. Works in English *Modern Swedish Poetry Pt. 1, 1929.Modern Swedish Poetry Pt. 1, trans. by C. D.

The station is owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. KNAT-TV's studios are located on Coors Boulevard in northwestern Albuquerque, and its transmitter is located on Sandia Crest. History Channel 23 began operation owned by New Mexico Visions as KMXN-TV in 1975 as a Spanish-language television station most of the day. They ran programming from the Spanish International Network (now Univision) daily in the afternoon and evening hours. In the mornings they ran religious programs in English. In the spring of 1980, Channel 23 changed the format to English- language general entertainment making it a traditional independent. The station ran cartoons from 7‚Äì9 a.m./3‚Äì5 p.m. weekdays, religious shows 9 a.m. to Noon weekdays, sitcoms/westerns/dramas/movies from noon to 3 p.m. weekdays, classic sitcoms or drama shows 5 to 7 p.m., movies from 7-9 p.m. weekdays, and a blend of dramas and westerns late at night. On weekends, the station ran more movies and drama shows along with religious shows on Sunday morning. The station changed call letters to KLKK to reflect the new format. In 1981, KGSW (channel 14) signed on and KLKK began to have financial difficulties. In the summer of 1982, KLKK was sold to Carson Broadcasting which was owned by a group of celebrities headed by Johnny Carson. Carson Broadcasting also owned KVVU channel 5 in Henderson, Nevada. The station was renamed KNAT. KNAT dropped all the religious programs and began to add more recent off network sitcoms and more recent movies. The religious shows would move to KGSW and a new sign on station KSAF channel 2. While KNAT had good ratings, the station continued to lose money. In April 1985, Carson Broadcasting decided that they could no longer put money into KNAT's operation. At the same time they sold KVVU to Meredith Corporation, which still owns them today. They put KNAT up for sale and sold the programming to KSAF, which became known as KNMZ that same year. KNAT then began airing music videos around the clock. In mid-May 1985, Carson Broadcasting shut down KNAT altogether after being unable to sell the station. The station stayed up for sale through the Fall of 1985, when Trinity Broadcasting Network, through National Minority Television, purchased KNAT. By the winter of 1986, KNAT was back on the air running TBN programming 24/7. Digital television KNAT-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 23, on that date. The station's digital signal remained on its pre- transition UHF channel 24. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 23.

Born in County Clare, Ireland in 1841, Fennell was just four years old when the Great Famine struck. Nonetheless he received a good education, attending either a Catholic school or a national school, and he learned to speak Gaelic at home.  Fenians  In 1863, Fennell became one of the first Fenians recruited from County Clare; he then helped recruit and organize a group of men in preparation for the Fenian Rising. On 5 March 1867, six Fenians men entered the Kilbaha coastguard station, and demanded the station's arms \\"in the name of the Irish Republic\\". A scuffle ensued, and Fennell was shot through the hip and testicle. The group retreated, and Fennell was treated for his injuries. He was arrested three days later. Tried for treason in the Clare Assizes, on 15 July 1867 he was found guilty and sentenced to ten years' penal labour. Initially he was lodged at Mountjoy Prison, a clearinghouse for political prisoners; later he was transferred to Portland prison. Perth Gazette and West Australian Times, 17 January 1868, announcing the arrival of the Hougoumont in Fremantle In October 1867, he was put on board the Hougoumont, a convict ship bound for Western Australia. The Hougoumont departed Portland on 12 October 1867 and arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia on 9 January 1868.  Pardon  Fennell remained in the Western Australian penal system until March 1871, when he received a conditional pardon under a Royal Clemency announced by William Ewart Gladstone the previous December. Banned from returning to the United Kingdom, Fennell sailed for New Zealand in May 1871. On arrival, he was immediately arrested and deported to New South Wales, as New Zealand had laws restricting immigration of ex-convicts. New South Wales had similar laws, but did not arrest him, presumably because he made known his intention of emigrating to the United States. He sailed for San Francisco on board the City of Melbourne. In 1872 he went to Connecticut. While there, he was approached by John Devoy about plans to rescue the military Fenians still in Western Australia's penal system. Fennell's suggestion was ultimately implemented in the Catalpa rescue. Although Devoy and the other Irish-Americans always credited Fennell with the original idea, Fennell himself claimed that the idea came from \\"two gentlemen in Australia whose names it would not be well to mention, and a Rev'd gentleman now out west in this country\\". In 1874 Fennell married Margaret Collins, and they moved to Elmira, New York. Fennell set up as the operator of the Commercial Hotel, and also served as the local agent for the Cunard Line, a city park commissioner, and Elmira's first Superintendent of Public Works. He helped to raise funds for various Irish causes, such as the Kilrush monument to the Manchester Martyrs. Fennell's first son, Thomas Francis Fennell was the head football coach at Penn State from 1904 to 1908.  Death  Fennell died on 23 February 1914 after a brief illness. He was survived by his wife and three children.

Its capital was Palermo (Arabic: Bal'harm), which during this period became a major cultural and political center of the Muslim world.Of Italy, Touring Club (2005). Authentic Sicily. Touring Editore. . Sicily was part of the Byzantine Empire when Muslim Moors from North Africa began launching raids in 652. Through a prolonged series of conflicts from 827 to 902, they gradually conquered the entirety of Sicily, with only the stronghold of Rometta, in the far northeast, holding out until 965. Under Muslim rule, the island became increasingly prosperous and cosmopolitan. Trade and agriculture flourished, and Palermo became one of the largest and wealthiest cities in Europe. Sicily became multiconfessional and multilingual, developing a distinct Arab-Byzantine culture that combined elements of its Islamic Arab and Berber migrants with those of the local Greek and Latin Christians, and Jewish communities. Beginning in the early eleventh century, the Emirate began to fracture from internal strife and dynastic disputes. Christian Norman mercenaries under Roger I ultimately conquered the island, founding the County of Sicily in 1071; the last Muslim city on the island, Noto, fell in 1091, marking the end of Islamic rule in Sicily. As the first Count of Sicily, Roger maintained a relative degree of tolerance and multiculturalism; Sicilian Muslims remained citizens of the County and the subsequent Kingdom of Sicily. Until the late 12th century, and probably as late as the 1220s, Muslims formed a majority of the island's population, except in the northeast region of Val Demone, which had remained predominantly Byzantine Greek and Christian, even during Islamic rule.Metcalfe (2009), pp. 34‚Äì36, 40 But by the mid thirteenth century, Muslims who had not already left or converted to Christianity were expelled, ending roughly four hundred years of Islamic presence in Sicily. Over two centuries of Islamic rule by the Emirate has left some traces in modern Sicily. Minor Arabic influence remains in the Sicilian language and in local place names; a much larger influence is in the Maltese language that derives from Siculo-Arabic. Other cultural remnants can be found in the island's agricultural methods and crops, the local cuisine, and architecture. Background  Due to its strategic location in the center of the Mediterranean, Sicily had a long history of being settled and contested by various civilizations. Greek and Phoenician colonies were present at least by the ninth century BC, and skirmished intermittently for centuries. Conflicts continued on a larger scale in the sixth through third centuries BC between the Carthaginians and the Sicilian Greeks, most of all the powerful city-state of Syracuse. The Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage saw Sicily serve as a major power base and theater of war for both sides, before the island was finally incorporated into the Roman Republic and Empire. By the fifth century AD, Sicily had become thoroughly Romanized and Christianized after nearly seven hundred years of Roman rule. But amid the decay of the Western Roman Empire, it fell to the Germanic Ostrogoths following Theodoric the Great's conquest of most of Italy in 488. First Muslim attempts to conquer Sicily In 535, Emperor Justinian I reconquered Sicily for the Roman Empire, which by then was ruled from Constantinople. As the power of what is now known as the Byzantine Empire waned in the West, a new and expansionist power was emerging in the Middle East: the Rashidun Caliphate, the first major Muslim state to emerge following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 632. Over a period of twenty five years, the caliphate succeeded in annexing much of the Persian Sasanian Empire and former Roman territories in the Levant and North Africa. In 652, under Caliph Uthman, an invasion captured most of the island, but Muslims occupation was short- lived, as they left following his death. By the end of the seventh century, with the Umayyad conquest of North Africa, the Muslims had captured the nearby port city of Carthage, allowing them to build shipyards and a permanent base from which to launch more sustained attacks. Around 700, the island of Pantelleria was captured by Muslims, and it was only discord among the Muslims that prevented an attempted invasion of Sicily at that time. Instead, trading agreements were arranged with the Byzantines, and Muslim merchants were allowed to trade goods at Sicilian ports. The first true attempt at conquest was launched in 740; in that year the Muslim prince Habib, who had participated in the 728 attack, successfully captured Syracuse. Ready to conquer the whole island, they were however forced to return to Tunisia by a Berber revolt. A second attack in 752 aimed only to sack the same city. Revolt of Euphemius and gradual Muslim conquest of the island In 826, Euphemius, the commander of the Byzantine fleet of Sicily, forced a nun to marry him. Emperor Michael II caught wind of the matter and ordered that General Constantine end the marriage and cut off Euphemius' nose. Euphemius rose up, killed Constantine and then occupied Syracuse; he in turn was defeated and driven out to North Africa. He offered rule of Sicily over to Ziyadat Allah, the Aghlabid Emir of Tunisia, in return for a place as a general and safety; the Emir agreed, offering to give Euphemius the island in exchange for a yearly tribute. The conquest was entrusted to the 70-year-old qadi Asad ibn al-Furat, who led a force 10,000 infantry, 700 cavalry and 100 ships. Reinforced by the Muslims, Euphemius' ships landed at Mazara del Vallo, where the first battle against loyalist Byzantine troops occurred on July 15, 827, resulting in an Aghlabid victory. Asad subsequently conquered the southern shore of the island and laid siege to Syracuse. After year-long siege, and an attempted mutiny, his troops were able to defeat a large army sent from Palermo, backed by a Venetian fleet led by Doge Giustiniano Participazio. A sudden outbreak of plague killed many of the Muslim troops, as well as Asad himself, forcing the Muslims to retreat to the castle Mineo. They later renewed their offensive, but failed to conquer Castrogiovanni (modern Enna) where Euphemius was killed, forcing them to retreat back to their stronghold at Mazara. In 830, the remaining Muslims of Sicily received a strong reinforcement of 30,000 Ifriqiyan and Andalusian troops. The Iberian Muslims defeated the Byzantine commander Teodotus between July and August of that year, but again a plague forced them to return to Mazara and later Ifriqiya. However, Ifriqiyan units sent to besiege the Sicilian capital of Palermo managed to capture it after a year long siege in September 831.Previte-Orton (1971), vol. 1, pg. 370 Palermo was made the Muslim capital of Sicily, renamed al-Madinah (\\"The City\\").Islam in Sicily , by Alwi Alatas The conquest was an incremental, see-saw affair; with considerable resistance and many internal struggles, it took over a century for Byzantine Sicily to be fully conquered. Syracuse held out until in 878, followed by Taormina in 902, and finally, Rometta, the last Byzantine outpost, in 965. Period as an emirate Arab-Norman art and architecture combined Occidental features (such as the Classical pillars and friezes) with typical Arabic decorations and calligraphy. In succession, Sicily was ruled by the Sunni Aghlabid dynasty in Tunisia and the Shiite Fatimids in Egypt. However, throughout this period, Sunni Muslims formed the majority of the Muslim community in Sicily, with most (if not all) of the people of Palermo being Sunni, leading to their hostility to the Shia Kalbids. The Sunni population of the island was replenished following sectarian rebellions across north Africa from 943‚Äì7 against the Fatimids' harsh religious policies, leading to several waves of refugees fleeing to Sicily in an attempt to escape Fatimid retaliation. The Byzantines took advantage of temporary discord to occupy the eastern end of the island for several years. After suppressing a revolt the Fatimid caliph Ismail al- Mansur appointed al-Hasan al-Kalbi (948‚Äì964) as Emir of Sicily. He successfully managed to control the continuously revolting Byzantines and founded the Kalbid dynasty. Raids into Southern Italy continued under the Kalbids into the 11th century, and in 982 a German army under Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor was defeated near Crotone in Calabria. With Emir Yusuf al-Kalbi (986‚Äì998) a period of steady decline began. Under al-Akhal (1017‚Äì1037) the dynastic conflict intensified, with factions within the ruling family allying themselves variously with the Byzantine Empire and the Zirids. After this period, Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis attempted to annex the island for the Zirids, while intervening in the affairs of the feuding Muslims; however, the attempt ultimately failed. Sicily under Arab rule Arab musicians in Palermo The new Arab rulers initiated land reforms, which in turn increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, a dent to the dominance of the landed estates. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems through Qanats. Introducing oranges, lemons, pistachio and sugarcane to Sicily. A description of Palermo was given by Ibn Hawqal, a Baghdad merchant who visited Sicily in 950. A walled suburb called the Kasr (the palace) is the center of Palermo until today, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman cathedral. The suburb of Al-Khalisa (Kalsa) contained the Sultan's palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqual reckoned 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. By 1050, Palermo had a population of 350,000, making it one of the largest cities in Europe, but behind Islamic Spain's capital C√≥rdoba and the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, which had populations over 450‚Äì500,000. Palermo's population dropped to 150,000 under Norman rule, while there was a greater decline in C√≥rdoba's population as Muslims there weakened; by 1330 Palermo's population had declined to 51,000. Arab traveler, geographer, and poet Ibn Jubair visited the area in the end of the 12th century and described Al-Kasr and Al-Khalisa (Kalsa): Throughout this reign, revolts by Byzantine Sicilians occurred, especially in the east, and part of the lands were even re-occupied before being quashed. dinar minted in Sicily, 879 The local population conquered by the Muslims were Romanized Catholic Sicilians in Western Sicily and Greek speaking Byzantine Catholics mainly in the eastern half of the island, but there were also a significant number of Jews.Archived link: From Islam to Christianity: the Case of Sicily, Charles Dalli, page 153. In Religion, ritual and mythology : aspects of identity formation in Europe / edited by Joaquim Carvalho, 2006, . The two populations were members of one Church until the events of 1054 began to separate them, the sack of 1204 being the last straw as far as the Byzantine \\"Orthodox\\" were concerned. Christians and Jews were tolerated under Muslim rule as dhimmis, but were subject to some restrictions. The dhimmis were also required to pay the jizya, or poll tax, and the kharaj or land tax, but were exempt from the tax that Muslims had to pay (Zakaat). Under Arab rule there were different categories of Jizya payers, but their common denominator was the payment of the Jizya as a mark of subjection to Muslim rule in exchange for protection against foreign and internal aggression. The conquered population could avoid this subservient status by converting to Islam. Whether by honest religious conviction or compulsion large numbers of native Sicilians converted to Islam. About half the population was Muslim at the time of the Norman Conquest. The Fatimids in the mid-10th century adopted a policy of active conversion and increased oppression of Christians. However, even after 100 years of Islamic rule, numerous Greek speaking Christian communities prospered, especially in north- eastern Sicily, as dhimmis. This was largely a result of the Jizya system which allowed co-existence. The co-existence with the conquered population fell apart after the reconquest of Sicily starting in the 1160s and particularly following the death of King William II of Sicily in 1189. The policy of oppression visited upon Christians was applied to Muslims. Decline and \\"Taifa\\" period  Roger I of Sicily receiving the keys of Palermo The Emirate of Sicily began to fragment as intra-dynastic quarrels took place within the Muslim regime. In 1044, under emir Hasan al-Samsam, who established al-Samsam Emirate of Sicily, the island fragmented into four qadits, or small fiefdoms: the qadit of Trapani, Marsala, Mazara and Sciacca, a certain Abdallah ibn Mankut; that of Girgenti, Castrogiovanni and Castronuovo (Ibn al- Haww√†s); that of Palermo and Catania; and that of Syracuse (Ibn Thumna). By 1065, all of them had been unified by Ayyub ibn Tamim, the son of the Zirid emir of Ifriqiyya. In 1068 he left Sicily, and what remained under Muslim control fell under two qadits: one, led by Ibn Abbad (known as Benavert in western chronicles) in Syracuse, and the other under Hammud in Qas'r Ianni (modern Enna). By the 11th century mainland southern Italian powers were hiring Norman mercenaries, who were Christian descendants of the Vikings; it was the Normans under Roger de Hauteville, who became Roger I of Sicily, that captured Sicily from the Muslims. In 1038, a Byzantine army under George Maniaces crossed the strait of Messina, and included a corps of Normans. After another decisive victory in the summer of 1040, Maniaces halted his march to lay siege to Syracuse. Despite his conquest of the latter, Maniaces was removed from his position, and the subsequent Muslim counter-offensive reconquered all the cities captured by the Byzantines. The Norman Robert Guiscard, son of Tancred, then conquered Sicily in 1060 after taking Apulia and Calabria, while his brother Roger de Hauteville occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. The Zirids of North Africa sent a support force, led by Ali and Ayyub ibn Tamin. However, Sicilians and Africans were defeated in 1063, in the Battle of Cerami. The sizeable Christian population rose up against the ruling Muslims. In 1068, Roger and his men defeated the Muslims forces commanded by Ayu ibn Tamim at Misilmeri. The Zirids left Sicily in disarray after the defeat and returned to North Africa. Catania fell to the Normans in 1071 followed by Palermo on 10 January 1072 after a five month siege. Trapani capitulated the same year. The loss of the main port cities dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. The last pocket of active resistance was Syracuse governed by Ibn Abbad (known by the Normans as Benavert). He defeated Jordan, son of Roger of Sicily in 1075, and occupied Catania again in 1081 and raided Calabria shortly after. However, Roger besieged Syracuse in 1086, and Ibn Abbad tried to break the siege with naval battle, in which he died accidentally. Syracuse surrendered after this defeat. His wife and son fled to Noto and Butera. Meanwhile the city of Qas'r Ianni (Enna) was still ruled by its emir, Ibn Al-Hawas, who held out for years. His successor, Hamud, surrendered, and converted to Christianity, only in 1087. After his conversion, Ibn Hamud subsequently became part of the Christian nobility and retired with his family to an estate in Calabria provided by Roger I. In 1091, Butera and Noto in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of Malta, the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians with ease. After the conquest of Sicily, the Normans removed the local emir, Yusuf Ibn Abdallah from power, but did so by respecting Arab customs. Aftermath Roger II The Norman Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II has been characterized as multi- ethnic in nature and religiously tolerant. Normans, Jews, Muslim Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards and native Sicilians lived in relative harmony.Roger II - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Arabic remained a language of government and administration for at least a century into Norman rule, and traces remain in the language of Sicily and evidently more in the language of Malta today. The Muslims also maintained their domination of industry, retailing and production, while Muslim artisans and expert knowledge in government and administration were highly sought after. However, the island's Muslims were faced with the choice of voluntary departure or subjection to Christian rule. Many Muslims chose to leave, provided they had the means to do so. \\"The transformation of Sicily into a Christian island\\", remarks Abulafia, \\"was also, paradoxically, the work of those whose culture was under threat\\". Charles Dalli, From Islam to Christianity: the Case of Sicily, p. 159 (archived link)Abulafia, The end of Muslim Sicily cit., p. 109 Also Muslims gradually converted to Christianity, the Normans replaced Orthodox clergy with Latin clerics. Despite the presence of an Arab-speaking Christian population Greek churchmen attracted Muslim peasants to receive baptism and even adopt Greek Christian names; in several instances, Christian serfs with Greek names listed in the Monreale registers had living Muslim parents. Charles Dalli, From Islam to Christianity: the Case of Sicily, p. 159 (archived link)J. Johns, The Greek church and the conversion of Muslims in Norman Sicily?, \\"Byzantinische Forschungen\\", 21, 1995; for Greek Christianity in Sicily see also V. von Falkenhausen, \\"Il monachesimo greco in Sicilia\\", in C.D. Fonseca (ed.), La Sicilia rupestre nel contesto delle civilt√† mediterranee, vol. 1, Lecce 1986. The Norman rulers followed a policy of steady Latinization by bringing in thousands of Italian settlers from the northwest and south of Italy, and some others from southeast France. To this day there are communities in central Sicily which speak the Gallo-Italic dialect. Some Muslims chose to feign conversion, but such a remedy could only provide individual protection and could not sustain a community. Charles Dalli, From Islam to Christianity: the Case of Sicily, p. 160 (archived link) \\"Lombard\\" pogroms against Muslims started in the 1160s. Muslim and Christian communities in Sicily became increasingly geographically separated. The island's Muslim communities were mainly isolated beyond an internal frontier which divided the south and western half of the island from the Christian north and eastern half. Sicilian Muslims, a subject population, were dependent on the mercy of their Christian masters and, ultimately, on royal protection. After King William the Good died in 1189 royal protection was lifted, and the door was opened for widespread attacks against the island's Muslims. This destroyed any lingering hope of coexistence, however unequal the respective populations might have been. The death of Henry VI and his wife Constance a year later plunged Sicily into political turmoil. With the loss of royal protection and with Frederick II still an infant in papal custody Sicily became a battleground for rival German and papal forces. The island's Muslim rebels sided with German warlords like Markward von Anweiler. In response, Innocent III declared a crusade against Markward, alleging that he had made an unholy alliance with the Saracens of Sicily. Nevertheless, in 1206 that same pope attempted to convince the Muslim leaders to remain loyal. Charles Dalli, From Islam to Christianity: the Case of Sicily, p. 160-161 (archived link) By this time the Muslim rebellion was in full swing. They were in control of Jato, Entella, Platani, Celso, Calatrasi, Corleone (taken in 1208), Guastanella and Cinisi. Muslim revolt extended throughout a whole stretch of western Sicily. The rebels were led by Muhammad Ibn AbbƒÅd. He called himself the \\"prince of believers\\", struck his own coins, and attempted to find Muslim support from other parts of the Muslim world. Charles Dalli, From Islam to Christianity: the Case of Sicily, p. 161 (archived link) However, Frederick II, no longer a child, responded by launching a series of campaigns against the Muslim rebels in 1221. The Hohenstaufen forces rooted out the defenders of Jato, Entella, and the other fortresses. Rather than exterminate the Muslims who numbered about 60,000. In 1223, Frederick II and the Christians began the first deportations of Muslims to Lucera in Apulia.A.Lowe: The Barrier and the bridge, op cit;p.92. A year later, expeditions were sent against Malta and Djerba, to establish royal control and prevent their Muslim populations from helping the rebels. The House of Hohenstaufen and their successors (Capetian House of Anjou and Aragonese House of Barcelona) gradually \\"Latinized\\" Sicily over the course of two centuries, and this social process laid the groundwork for the introduction of Latin (as opposed to Byzantine) Catholicism. The process of Latinization was fostered largely by the Roman Church and its liturgy. The annihilation of Islam in Sicily was completed by the late 1240s, when the final deportations to Lucera took place. By the time of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282 there were no Muslims in Sicily and the society was completely Latinized.

Tassin was born at Lonlay, in the Diocese of Le Mans. He was professed at the Abbey of Jumi√®ges in 1718. United in close friendship with his brother in religion, Dom Charles-Fran√ßois Toustain, he collaborated with him on a new edition of the works of Theodore the Studite, which task led them to visit Rome together. Their work was interrupted by a dispute between the Benedictine Abbey of St. Ouen and the chapter of Rouen, which was supported by the erudite Jean Saas. Tassin and his friend wrote against Saas in defence of their brethren. They then resided at the Abbey of Rouen where they remained till 1747, when they were summoned to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, at Paris, by their general. To defend the authenticity of the deeds of their abbey they were obliged to make a deep study of diplomatics, dealing with diplomas, charters, and other official documents, for which Jean Mabillon had laid the foundations in his great Latin work, De re diplomatica (1681). As a result of their researches they wrote the Nouveau trait√© de diplomatique, in six quarto volumes, which appeared between the years 1750 and 1765. Toustain died before the second volume had been entirely printed, and so Tassin saw the great work to completion. However, he wished the name of his friend to be associated with the project in its entirety, and consequently all the volumes are described as the work of \\"two Benedictines\\". Tassin later wrote his Histoire litt√©raire de la Congr√©gation de Saint-Maur (Paris and Brussels, 1770), a model history containing the lives and list of works, printed or in manuscript, of all the learned authors of the Congregation, from its formation in 1618 until his own time, including a list of their works, printed or in manuscript. Several manuscript works of Tassin are in the Biblioth√®que nationale in Paris. Tassin died in Paris.

David Greig was the supermarket (initially grocery shop) chain founded by the Greig family of Hornsey, north London. With its headquarters at Atlantic Road, Brixton (and later at Waterloo Road, London) and grocery shops across southern England, it was a rival to the Sainsbury's chain, John and Mary Sainsbury having opened their first grocery shop in Holborn one year earlier. A deep personal rivalry developed between the two families, because of acrimonious feelings about the Greigs' alleged betrayal of a verbal agreement regarding the purchasing of sites for development. The David Greig chain is considered to have been established in 1870, when the founder's mother opened a small provisions shop at 32 High Street, Hornsey. By 1881 David Greig had joined his mother in the business and described himself as a 'provision dealer' in the census of that year. Beyond, Hornsey, Greig opened his first shop at 54-58 Atlantic Road, Brixton in 1888, initially \\"anchoring\\" the nascent Brixton Market, which started in Atlantic Road in the 1870s and was so successful that it spread to Brixton Road before being relocated to Brixton Station Road plus several purpose built covered arcades and finally also Electric Avenue, to reduce congestion and allow further growth. By the late 1960s, there were more than 220 Greig shops across the south of the country, all trading under the David Greig brand. However, the company was sold to Fitch lovell and merged into Fitch Lovell's own Key Markets supermarket brand in 1972 after crippling death duties were incurred when several of the men in the family died in quick succession, with inheritance tax obligatory on their entirely private holdings. Key Markets was later bought by Gateway, and eventually rebranded as Somerfield, although several of the larger stores were taken over by ASDA, including the Sturry Road site, near Canterbury. This was in turn bought by the Co-operative Group. Each of these changes included considerable restructuring, so many ex-Greig stores may now be in different ownership. David Greig was a notable philanthropist, leaving trusts for the benefit of Hornsey and the community. These have contributed to the Greig City Academy in Hornsey. A commemorative plaque has been placed on 32 Hornsey High Street, the site of the very first Greig shop. The David Greig shop at 54-58 Atlantic Road, Brixton, is no longer a supermarket, but the frontage, containing a \\"DG\\" cypher, remains relatively original, and although the full name has been removed from the facade it is still visible in the mosaic floor outside the recessed shop entrance. The David Greig shop at 65 Lordship Lane in East Dulwich is listed Grade II for its authentic 19th-century interior. The old David Greig building at 23 St Georges Street Canterbury (now Superdrug) was designed by Robert Paine and Partners in 1952 and became a listed building in 1995 under the English Heritage building protection scheme. There is an inscription on the wall, in memory of DAVID GREIG, founder and DAVID ROSS GREIG. When Superdrug refurbished the store in the 1990s and the marble replaced, a stonemason was employed to re-create the inscription. It can still be seen today. There is another facility in Alcester (Warwickshire) in memory of his wife Hannah Susan. The current sports, arts and community facilities are called The Greig and are managed by the Hannah Susan Greig Memorial Company Limited. thumb Shop Front Meadow St Weston super Mare 2015 Shop Front 2015 Shop Front 2015 The family tableaux is located in Magpie Hall Lane cemetery, Bromley, London.ent.

The sixth man in basketball is a player who is not a starter but comes off the bench much more often than other reserves, often being the first player to be substituted in. The sixth man often plays minutes equal to or exceeding some of the starters and posts similar statistics. He is often a player who can play multiple positions, hence his utility in substituting often. For example, Kevin McHale, a famous sixth man who played for the Boston Celtics in the 1980s, variably played center and power forward. The presence of a good sixth man is often a sign of team excellence. It usually means that a team has excellent depth, as the sixth man is usually more than talented enough to start for most teams. A common strategy is to place a good scorer as a sixth man when the starting lineup already has enough scorers. In this case, the sixth man will enter the game without the team suffering a drop-off in scoring. This was used during the Chicago Bulls' championship runs with forward Toni Kukoƒç and more recently with Manu Gin√≥bili of the San Antonio Spurs, Leandro Barbosa during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns, Jason Terry during his time with the Dallas Mavericks, James Harden during his time with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Jamal Crawford with the Los Angeles Clippers. Another common strategy is to wait for the game to develop, thus letting the sixth man read the opponent's weak spots and take advantage of them once he steps in. Theo Papaloukas brought this tactic to another level both for CSKA and Olympiacos, as well as the Greek national team. Legendary Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach has been credited with creating the sixth man.Auerbach explained the prestige of not being one of the five starters in Chapter 2 of his book, On and Off the Court (1985), Macmillan. He first used guard Frank Ramsey, who played behind the Hall-of- Fame duo of Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman, in the role during the early part of the Celtics' dynasty years. Though Ramsey was one of the Celtics' best players, he felt more comfortable coming off the bench and Auerbach wanted his best players fresh and in the lineup at the end of close games. The most famous sixth man, however, was teammate John Havlicek, who revolutionized the role during his 16-year career.

This box set gives an extensive overview of Thompson's long career without including content from any of his mainstream albums. While many of the songs included will be familiar to Thompson fans, the actual tracks are mostly live and nearly all previously unreleased, and the arrangements are often different from those of the original recording. Thompson himself granted the compilers access to his personal archives of recordings and photos, and other collectors of Thompsonia (most notably American record producer Edward Haber) also contributed to the set. Thompson retained (and exercised) the right of veto over any aspect of the set. Of particular interest are live tracks by Richard and Linda Thompson (including a few from the 1982 \\"tour from hell\\"), songs demoed for his first solo album Henry The Human Fly as well as several of Thompson's comic songs (\\"Madonna's Wedding\\" and his lampooning of Janet Jackson's infamous breast baring moment at the Super Bowl) and several songs that Thompson himself has never released. The set also includes a 168-page book ‚Äì consisting of a biography, an exclusive interview and track notes ‚Äì and a reproduction of a Vincent motorcycle catalogue (a reference to Thompon's best loved song ‚Äú1952 Vincent Black Lightning‚Äù). As with the actual track selection Thompson had input into the book and was involved in the proofreading and supplied some of the photos that are included. Despite this interaction by the artist, the booklet is riddled with typographical errors.

It is an extensive area and forms the northwestern part of Mokokchung. Until 2003, Yimyu was a separate town and not under Mokokchung Municipal Council. However the last two decades has seen the gradual expansion of the settlements of both Yimyu and Mokokchung and had become a continuous settlement area. In 2003, Yimyu was formally incorporated as part of Mokokchung town. The Mariani- Mokokchung Highway passes through this ward. Mokokchung District Jail and DIET College are located here.  Location  Yimyu is situated in the North-West side of Mokokchung District about three kilometers from the heart of Mokokchung Town. Kubolong bound it in the North, Alichen and Longkum in the South, Mokokchung Village in the North-East and Aliba and Kinunger in the West. It is a narrow strip of mountainous territory between Mokokchung town and Khensa village. Ongpangkong Compound falls under the jurisdiction of Khensa village but they have a separate administration council under the chairmanship of Extra Assistant Commissioner(EAC) of Ongpangkong range. Yimyu is located at an altitude of about 1100 metres above sea level. History  There are many stories behind the name Yimyu, and many suggested meanings. First, Yimyu is derived from the word \\"Yimyu Langjem\\" meaning 'meeting place'. 'Yim' means 'village', 'Yu' means 'word' and 'Langjem' means 'decide'. It is said that there was a dispute between Khensa village and Settsu village, and it was at this particular place that the Khensa villagers met to discuss their strategies and plans with their rival. Second, the bird Oyim once flew across this place and it was called Yimyu, which means the Oyim flew over this land. Third, the term Yimyu is derived from the Phom Naga dialect. Today it has been altered to YimYu Ward Ongpangkong because this is the central place for Ongpangkong range among 16 villages. The decision to alter the name was made by all the 16 villages that fall under the jurisdiction of Ongpangkong range.

He belonged to a family of note. On 20 July 1718, he made the vows of the order at Jumi√®ges. After finishing the philosophical and theological course at the Abbey of F√©camp, he was sent to the monastery of Bonne-Nouvelle at Rouen, to learn Hebrew and Greek. At the same time he studied Italian, English, German, and Dutch, in order to be able to understand the writers in these languages. He was not ordained priest until 1729 and then only at the express command of his superior. He always said Mass with much trepidation and only after long preparation. In 1730 he entered the Abbey of St-Ouen at Rouen, went later to the Abbey of St-Germain-des-Pres and Blancs-Manteaux, and died while taking his milk-cure at Saint-Denis. He had worn out his body by fasting and ascetic practices. His theological opinions inclined to Jansenism. As a scholar he made himself an honoured name. He worked for twenty years with a fellow-member of the order, Dom Tassin, on an edition of the works of St. Theodore of Studium. It was never printed, for a publisher could not be found. Another common undertaking of the two is the \\"Nouveau trait√© de diplomatique\\" (6 vols., 1750‚Äì65) in which they treated more fully and thoroughly the subjects taken up in Mabillon's great work \\"De re diplomatica\\". The publication of Toustain and Tassin is of permanent value. The last four volumes were edited by Tassin alone after Toustain's death.

The Ligures living in this area of the Po river plain belonged specifically to the Taurini tribe. The location of Chieri is within the Taurini tribe's territory, in the belt of hills which surround Turin. The original settlement was most likely founded by them, being sited on a prominent hill (on which the church of San Giorgio currently stands) and growing to be the geographical focus of the city centre. Its original name would have been Karreum or a variant thereof (e.g. Karreo/Karrea/Carrea); this is based on the root kar, which possibly means \\"stone\\", reflecting the typical Ligurian settlement layout of a stone edifice at the centre of a grouping of other habitations within a village, which would have likely been the original layout of Chieri. Sometime around 400 BCE, Celtic tribes crossed the Alps from Gaul and settled the Po river plain. These peoples mingled with the original Ligures, either through conquest or peaceful cohabitation, and gave rise to a Celto-Ligurian people, inhabiting the region which the Romans would call Cisalpine Gaul, i.e. \\"Gaul this side of the Alps\\". = Roman= The Romans, over the two centuries between 400-200 BCE, conducted a prolonged counter- offensive to conquer all of the northern Italian peninsula, partially in response to successive invasions, starting with Gauls led by king Brennus in 391 BCE, and later the Carthaginians under the great general Hannibal Barca in 218 BCE. It is likely sometime after 176 BCE that Cisalpine Gaul was completely subdued by Roman legions, and this would have included the village of Karreum itself. This was possibly under the command of Roman consul Caius Claudius Pulcrus, leading a military response to a rebellion the year before by the Ligures. Following this Roman conquest in the 2nd Century BCE, the village became known as the Roman settlement of Carreum Potentia: the Latin name Potentia (derived from potens, \\"powerful\\") being added as a cognomen to the original Ligurian name. It is likely that, following similar examples elsewhere, at Carreum Potentia the Roman settlement was built alongside the pre-Roman one, the Roman part built on lower ground in the plain, alongside the Rio Tepice stream and at the base of the original native hill-top settlement. It would appear the Forum and the main Temple (most likely dedicated to the goddess Minerva) were located in the area where the cathedral and the piazza around it currently stand, with a wall around it (traces of which were excavated in the 1960s). Roman historian Pliny the Elder referenced \\"Carreum quod Potentia cognominatur\\", in his Naturalis Historia (dated 50-60 AD), naming it within a list of fortified settlements which then abounded in the section of Cisalpine Gaul between the River Po and the Ligurian Apennines: the city was portrayed as a prosperous Roman walled city, surrounded by cultivated farmlands and scattered agricultural settlements. By the 1st Century AD, Carreum Potentia was indeed referred to as a Roman municipium, i.e. a seat of local government for the surrounding area. The city underwent conversion to Christianity sometime in the 5th century, as recorded on a funeral slab dated from June 488 AD for a little girl called Genesia who died at the age of two. According to Marguerite de Lussan, biographer of Louis Balbe-Bertone de Crillon, the city of Chieri was given a republican form of government by a Balbus, member of a patrician Roman family, who relocated to the city in the late sixth century. No evidence of this statement is provided, although Chieri would emerge in the middle ages as a republic striving for independence from its feudal liege lords. =Early Middle Ages= No further historical records exist regarding Chieri until the 10th century, when it was officially granted as a fief to the Bishop of Turin by an Imperial grant of Otto III, although it was also subject to the military authority of the larger march of Italy, whose holder at the time was the titular Count of the House of Savoy through his marriage to Adelaide of Susa. Following the death of Adelaide of Susa, Marchioness of Turin, many of the Piedmontese holdings of the counts of Savoy were lost by her heir Umberto II. In the political fragmentation which followed, the Piedmontese lands east of Turin were divided into the counties of Saluzzo, Biandrate and the March of Montferrat, which eventually allowed the cities of Chieri and Asti to flourish economically and declare independence from their respective liege bishops as free cities, supported by the House of Savoy who were interested in diminishing the power of the local feudal lords. The process of obtaining independence was gradual and prudent and started with various administrative and tax reforms to provide the city's government with resources and offices of government of Roman stamp, consuls, as well as with the strengthening of the city's fortifications. In this gradual manner, the city of Chieri started to expand its influence to the neighbouring territories. By the first half of the 11th century, the city had an encircling defensive wall erected around the San Giorgio Hill (known as the Castrum Sancti Georgi, which still constitutes the city nucleus), under the direction of Bishop Landulf: these long-demolished Mura Landolfiane still clearly trace the outline of the pattern of narrow streets around the hill (known as the Chiocciola, \\"snail\\"). The work included a strengthening of the fortifications and tower atop the hill, now incorporated into the Church of San Giorgio which occupies the hilltop and overlooks the city. Outside the walls, on the plains surrounding the city, a church was erected dedicated to the Virgin Mary: this site was likely that of an earlier and more primitive Church dating from the 4th century, which had itself replaced the earlier Roman Temple to Minerva. This period also experienced the construction of numerous quadrilateral towers inside the perimeter of the walls by the powerful families of the city, hence it became known as Citt√† delle Cento Torri (\\"city of one hundred towers\\"): a handful of these towers still survive to this day. In 1154, the city allied itself with the more powerful city of Asti in fighting against William V of Montferrat, defeating him in battle. At the first Diet of Roncaglia, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa who had descended upon Italy with his army to restore his sovereignty, granted William V of Montferrat, who had married a niece of the Emperor, rights over the two cities. With his army following the river Po, the Emperor was determined to lay siege to both cities. The citizen of Chieri, knowing that the city would be no match for a siege by the Imperial Army, fled the city carefully leaving behind copious amounts of wine and food for the invaders, who nonetheless proceeded to demolish its towers and ruin its fortifications, ultimately setting the city on fire in January of 1155, before moving on to Asti, where they would repeat the deed. Popular legend has it that the present-day name of the city was given by Barbarossa, who, upon departing the city after ransacking it, looked back upon its ruins and asked Ma tu, chi eri? (Italian for \\"And you, who were you?\\"), although this story is most likely apocryphal. In 1158, the Emperor returned to Italy to deal with the continued insurgence of the cities of northern Italy, which were growing politically bolder and economically more prosperous. Although this time Chieri sided with the Emperor and immediately contributed to his army, it was terribly compensated, for it was newly to the Bishop of Turin who in turn gave it to the powerful Guido III, Count of Biandrate, possibly fearing that alone he may not have sufficient power to hold it. In 1169, Chieri and Asti signed a defensive treaty of mutual aid to defend themselves from the ambitions of the Counts of Biandrate and found themselves shortly after victorious in a war against them, restoring some of their rights and furthering their path towards independence. In 1176, the Emperor was defeated by the Lombard League at the battle of Legnano and personally injured. The Balbo family from the city of Chieri participated in the battle fighting in the Guelph side, against the Emperor. At the end of the century, the city allied with Testona to declare war on its ecclesiastical liege lord the Bishop of Turin, Arduino Valperga. The town of Turin, the counts of Biandrate, and the lords of Cavoretto and Revigliasco joined on the side of the Bishop, while the lords of Cavorre and Piossasco joined on the side of the republic of Chieri. The republic of Asti, which was bound to Chieri by similar ambitions and fate, and by a military pact of 1194, came to the aid of Chieri. Although first hand recollections of the war are unavailable, it is assumed by the following peace that the war was favorable to Chieri. The peace was signed in the fields of Mairano, near Testona, on 10 February 1200 in the presence of ambassadors of Asti and Vercelli, the Bishop Arduino, the Podest√† of Turin, Chieri and Testona, and numerous prominent citizens of the city, including two Pulluolii, Uberto di Bencia, two Merli, Pier Gribaldo, Signorino Balbo and Enerico Tana. The peace had several clauses, of which the most important was likely a clause stating that the two republics of Testona and Chieri would aid the Count of Savoy were he to exercise his rights over the city of Turin and the Bishop, in recognition that he was the heir of their former sovereigns and out of mutual enmity with Turin. A treaty of 4 March 1204 bound Chieri, Testona and Turin. On top of the defensive and mutual aid clauses, others were made to establish that each of the cities would enjoy the same municipal privileges of the others, and that they would share the same podest√†. Many provisions were made in regards to the bridge of Testona (today at Moncalieri), which was of vital economical importance to all three cities, including its tolls, the roads leading to it and the guards to be provided. Although ambitious in nature, the treaty was soon put aside, with a new Bishop of Turin requesting that many of his privileges be restored. This interestingly included being beneficiary of all fines for homicide, theft, treason and for duels, as well as of those foreigners who died without will and those of Chieri with no will and no relatives up to the fourth grade. This was ratified in a treaty in 1210. On 10 June of the same year, the city signed a treaty with Goffredo, Count of Biandrate, and his nephews for mutual defense against all enemies save for the Emperor and the Bishop. More interestingly, the treaty forbade the Count to give citizenship to any man of the city of Chieri, and vice versa for Chieri to offer citizenship to any of his subjects. The clause is characteristic of the regulation of growth in the medieval period, where the founding of a city required imperial dispensation, fortifications were to be approved by liege lords, and the movement of people was an enormous loss of capital for the feudal system, although one that would prove irreversible as urban areas grew larger and more powerful over the coming centuries. Many of the privileges earned were to be confirmed by Otto IV, to whom a richer Chieri sent the ambassador Iacopo de Rohat, their podest√†, and many others. Privileges he granted the city included the faculty of receiving new citizens as well as confirmed sovereignty over smaller territories nearby. In 1123 and 1224, respectively, Riva and Coazze were annexed by Chieri. The inhabitants of the latter were moved closer to Chieri with its help to the lands of Pecetto. Greatly responsible for the prosperity of Chieri at this time was Ugone del Carretto, podest√† of Chieri and in 1225 of Asti. He was also instrumental for the purchase by the city of the Castle of Revigliasco and its surrounding lands. Finally, the commercial disputes over the merchant root from Genova and Lombardy which went through Asti and Chieri, which took Italian merchants to France, resulted in a new war by Chieri and Asti against Testona. In 1228, the troops of the two allied cities razed Testona to the ground, not sparing even its churches. In the following years, the dispersed inhabitants resettled in the nearby locality of Moncalieri. =Late Middle Ages= In the course of the 13th century, the Republic of Chieri experienced a period of substantial prosperity, and at that time was comparable in splendor and importance to other Italian city-states such as Genoa, Asti and Pisa. In 1238, the Republic was granted the status of camera speciale (Italian: \\"special chamber\\") by Emperor Frederick II, which meant that the only authority the Republic would be subject to was that of the (very remote) emperor. Following growing violent internecine struggles between city factions to the end of that century, the Republic of Chieri, despite asserting its dominion over adjacent lands and castles and constructing a secondary ring of city walls, decreased in power and autonomy to the point that in 1339 the city made itself subject to Robert of Anjou, King of Naples; in doing so, it granted half of its lands and territories as feudal possession to Prince Iacopo of the house of Savoy-Acaia. The city eventually passed in its entirety to the House of Savoy, when the line of Acaia died out. =Renaissance era= The 15th century brought Chieri a period of economic prosperity and a flourishing of the arts with, among other endeavours, the rebuilding of the Church of Santa Maria into its present form as the Duomo. During this time the hill-top church of San Giorgio was also rebuilt into its current incarnation, and several works of Flemish art were brought into the area by rich city merchants. The 16th century covered a period of succeeding plagues, epidemics, and wars, and from 1551 to 1562 also brought French domination. During this period, some of its citizens became followers of the Protestant Reformation started by Martin Luther, but this was quashed by strong opposition from Duke Emmanuel Philibert: it was in order to honour him, along with Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy, that the city towards the end of this century constructed a triumphal arch, still present on the main street (currently Via Vittorio Emanuele II). The year 1630 saw a terrible outbreak of the Bubonic Plague, which is still commemorated every 12 September with the ceremony of the Madonna delle Grazie. Despite this, the remainder of the 17th century experienced a flourishing of artistic achievement, with the building of several churches and chapels in Baroque style, as well as numerous paintings and sculptures. =Modern era= In 1785 Chieri became a Principality under the control of the Duke of Aosta. The late 18th century again brought French domination, this time under the conquests of Napoleon Bonaparte, but this period also witnessed the establishment of a major textile mill, which consolidated and built upon the city's base as a medieval centre for textile trade and manufacture. Numerous other textile factories followed in the late 19th century, with textile manufacture originating from Chieri playing a prominent role even in international textile fairs. The year 1850 saw the demolition of the old medieval city gates and the privatisation of the city walls, which at that time still demarcated the limits of the entire city. In 1871, a railroad link was constructed to the city in the form of the Chieri-Trofarello branch line, partly due to contributions from the municipality and from wealthy citizens. This was to serve the now very significant textile industry of the city, with the building of the railway station also serving to initiate in the surrounding area the erection of the first city quarter built outside its walls. The early 20th century brought the electrification of the textile industries (1909). World War II caused no direct bombardments to the city despite the relocation of numerous factories and heavy industry manufacture from the nearby major industrial centre of Turin. Germany occupied the city following the 1943 Armistice of Cassibile until its liberation by Allied forces. =Today= The post-war period experienced a huge increase in Chieri's population, as massive migration occurred between the 1950s and 1970s from the Veneto region and from Southern Italy to the major industrial centres of Northern Italy such as Milan and Turin and adjacent areas. This resulted in a population boom from approximately 14,000 immediately after the war to 30,000 inhabitants in just under three decades. The later years of the 20th century also witnessed the decline of textile industry in the city, as numerous factories were forced to close from competitive pressure from the cheaper manufacturing centres of the Indian subcontinent and the Far East. This is being counteracted by the establishment of a new industrial area outside the city, and also by a rediscovering and redeveloping of Chieri's significant cultural and historical heritage. Today, Chieri is a growing center for the provision of a varied portfolio of commercial, retail, financial, and tertiary services. Main sights * Chieri Cathedral: Gothic-style Duomo (cathedral), founded in 1037 and reconstructed in 1405, is the largest in Piedmont, and has a 13th-century octagonal Baptistery which includes a collection of 13th century frescoes.

Using four weapons (including three semi- automatic), the perpetrator killed seven people, starting with his ex-wife Carla Bergamin, at whose house the tragedy occurred. His other victims included her widowed mother Teresa Gobbo; Carla's brother Sergio Bargamin and his wife Margherita Feyles, who operated a textile workshop on the ground floor of their house; next-door neighbour Decio Guerra along with his wife; and Pierangela Gramaglia, a friend of Margherita's who also worked for them at their workshop. The perpetrator took his own life before police arrived on the scene.http://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/chieri/chieri/chieri.html La Repubblica.it, \\"Fa strage e si uccide otto morti nel torinese\\" (in Italian). 15 October 2002 International relations Chieri is twinned with: * √âpinal, France * Nanoro, Burkina Faso * Tolve, Italy * Adria, Italy References * External links * www.comune.chieri.to.it/ Roman towns and cities in Italy Cities and towns in Piedmont ","title":"Chieri"},{"id":"4025702","text":"Baltrum () is a barrier island off the coast of East Frisia (), in Germany, and is a municipality in the district of Aurich, Lower Saxony. It is located in-between the chain of the seven inhabited East Frisian Islands. Baltrum is the smallest island in this chain by area and inhabitants. It has a land area of 6.5 square kilometres, and a population in (2011) of just over 500 resident inhabitants. Geography It is located in the middle of the island chain known as the East Frisian Islands () and is the smallest permanently inhabited island in the chain according to the area and number of inhabitants. The gat or tidal channel of Wichter Ee in the west separates Baltrum from Norderney and the tidal creek Accumer Ee in the east separates it from Langeoog. There are two villages on the island ‚Äì Ostdorf () and Westdorf () ‚Äì although they have essentially merged into one. The ferry for Baltrum departs from the small port near the village of Ne√ümersiel (in the parish of Dornum) with connection to the train station of Norden. The island has its own ferry terminal and a small airstrip. The island is about long and wide. It covers an area of and has a population of around 600 people, swelling to about 3,500 during the summer months due to tourism. Tourists (mainly from the Ruhr Area in North Rhine-Westphalia) travel to Baltrum to enjoy the countryside of the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park, the beach and attractions such as the indoor swimming pool filled with sea water or a miniature golf course. The highest point on the island is a central coastal dune with a viewing platform on top called Aussichtsd√ºne in German and is above sea-level.  Etymology  The origin of the name Baltrum is not clearly clarified. In 1398, the island was mentioned for the first time in a document of enfeoffment as Balteringe meaning either \\"pasture\\" or \\"[the place of] the sons or followers of Balter\\" in Old Frisian. Another assumption is that the name is derived from the Norse god Baldr ‚Äì son of Odin and Frigg. In the recent past an ironic version arose, one would be bald 'rum () when encircling the island, as the island is small it would not take a long time to walk around Baltrum. Nevertheless, the circumference amounts to about .  History  Location of Baltrum within the East Frisian Islands Map of Baltrum by Karl Ludwig von Lecoq 1805 with the village The geographers Strabo and Pliny the Elder provide an indication that the island existed since the first century BC and AD. During the era of the East Frisian chieftains, from 1350 to 1464, the East Frisian islands belonged to the powerful family tom Brok. In 1398 Baltrum was mentioned in a document for the first time, when Widzel tom Brok assigned Balteringe (besides the other islands) to Duke Albert I of Bavaria and received them back as fief. In the 17th century Baltrum had an elongated shape similar to the present shape of the barrier islands Norderney and Juist. Through the centuries Baltrum lost a huge amount of land at its west coast due to wind and sea conditions which the extension at the east coast could not compensate. Between 1650 and 1960 the island moved about at its west side to east, whereas the east coast moved only to east. A journey from a committee in 1650 reports that the 14 inhabitants on the island of that time were in jeopardy by the sea. In 1737 there was a village with a church which had to be abandoned due to silting of shifting sand dunes in 1800. The new village, named Western village, was settled down around to the west of the present day west coast (near the present day shoal Othelloplate in-between Baltrum and Norderney) and in the east there was the Eastern village. A storm surge in 1825 disrupted the island in several pieces and it became mostly uninhabitable, followed by deserting the Western village. From 1870 onwards the island was protected against the power of the sea with groynes, wooden palisades and revetments. Furthermore, are levees protecting the built-up area against floodings. On the island exist no official street names but house numbers, instead. Currently (retrieved 2009), are about 300 numbers assigned to houses. The numbering is based on the date of the house construction in ascending order. So the numbers reveal some history of the buildings on the island. However the numbers do not change if a building is replaced by a newer construction.  Tourism  Beach of Baltrum Although Baltrum became a seaside resort in 1876, the tourism grew very slowly. Since 1966 Baltrum has been a seaside health resort approved by the state of Germany. Two hotels were opened in the end of the 19th century, Hotel K√ºper in 1892 and Hotel zur Post in 1895. Before the World War II broke out 5,000 to 6,000 people visited Baltrum annually. In 1960 nearly 17,000 tourists showed up and since the 1970s there are over 30,000 people making holidays every year during the peak season. Besides the approximately 500 inhabitants about 3,000 guests are constantly living on the island during the peak seasons exhausting the acceptance capacity of the two small villages.  Points of interest  * Old church of the island: In 1826 the church was built as Lutheran church, later used as Catholic church, afterwards as a morgue. In present days it is only used for marriage ceremonies, baptisms and cultural events. * Great Lutheran church of the island: This church was built in the years of 1929‚Äì30. Both naves were attached in 1959, the tower was elevated in 1964‚Äì65. * Saint Nicholas church: The foundation block of the Catholic church was laid on Saint Nicholas Day in 1956 and consecrated on Ascension Day in 1957. The church has a closed building used during the winter (winter church) and a thatching roofed building used in the summer season (summer church). The winter church has seats for 50 people and the summer church can receive up to 300 people. The constructor of the church was the architect Heinrich Feldwisch-Drentrup from Osnabr√ºck, the glass windows were created by Margarete Franke. * Historical palisade for protection: The palisade for protection () is located at the southwestern side. It was positioned in the 1880s and renewed in 1930‚Äì31. Nowadays it is only a section of the original palisade in- between the tiny harbor and the western end. It is heritage-protected and due to extensive restoration works in 2008 repaired at the western side. * Museum of local history in the old custom house: The museum was opened in the old custom house by the association of local history of Baltrum on May 24, 2007. The exhibition covers the local and the natural history. * National park museum: Founded in 1987 in the former shed of the shipping company Baltrum Linie and focuses on the tides.

The only exceptions are vehicles of the volunteer fire department, an ambulance, a few wheel loaders and some machines needed for the coastal protection. From 1949 until 1985 there was a small single track Inselbahn Baltrum () which was an unelectrified narrow gauge railway for baggage and cargo transportation. No bicycle sharing system exists on Baltrum and the tourists are asked not to bring their own bicycles onto the island, riding bicycles is the privilege of inhabitants. The passenger and freight transportation is accomplished by horse-drawn carriages. The baggage is transported by two-wheeled or four- wheeled carts or also carriages, use of electrical bicycles is the latest trend. There are no street names on Baltrum, and postal addresses are related to the chronology of the development of the areas meaning that the numbering is geographically independent. There is a search and rescue station presently on Baltrum which is operated by the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service.  Transportation  = Ferry services = Baltrum is tidal independent laid by ferries owned by the shipping company Baltrum Line, founded in 1928, starting in Ne√ümersiel. The journey takes about 30 minutes and depending on the season and tourist season one ferry leaves once up to four times for each direction daily. The baggage is containerized and transported in the same ferry as the vacationers. The highlights of the passage are the seals on the shoals ahead of Norderney passed by the ferry. The shipping company manages a bus connection to the train station of Norden, Lower Saxony. Until 2006 the freight traffic was accomplished with the ferry Baltrum II via the port in Norddeich, Lower Saxony, but since then is transacted via the port in Ne√ümersiel. The port of Ne√ümersiel was inaugurated in 1970 and extended by a cargo wharf with in length from April to August 2008 due to the relocation of the freight transportation. = Airport = Airstrip The airstrip on Baltrum achieves the connection by air to Norddeich. = Walk = At the event of low water Baltrum is reachable from the port of Ne√ümersiel as a guided walk across the mudflats taking 2.5 hours.

Geography Celano rises on the top of a hill in the territory of Marsica, below the mountain range of Sirente. It faces the valley of Fucino, once filled by the large Fucine Lake, which was drained during the 19th century.  History  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Celano suffered from the invasions of Lombards (6th century). The city passed under Byzantine control, and was then subdued by the Lombards and governed by the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento. From the 8th century, Charlemagne and his descendants ruled the Marsica region independently of Spoleto, raising it to the rank of county. Celano was elected Caput Marsorum (capital city of the Marsica region), governed by the Berardi family. From around the year 1140, it was captured by the Normans, who annexed it to the Kingdom of Sicily. Fearing that Marsica was becoming too powerful, in the year 1223 Emperor Frederick II ordered his army to destroy the castles of the region. Celano suffered a long siege, which ended with its defeat and total destruction and the exile of its entire male population to Sicily and Malta. Once the feudal rights of Celano were abolished the region came under the jurisdiction of the Giustizierato of Abruzzo, with Sulmona as capital. After the intercession of the Pope Honorius III, Emperor Frederick II authorised the inhabitants to return from exile. The new city was rebuilt three years after its destruction, about one kilometre from the ancient city. Celano reflourished and was once again governed by the Berardi family. After a series of struggles between the Angevins and Aragonese, in the 15th century the family of Berardi was dethroned by the family of the Pope Pius II of Pienza, allied to the Aragonese, who governed the city and its county. Celano was incorporated into the Kingdom of Naples till 1860, except during the years associated with the Napoleonic era and the Parthenopean Republic. In the year 1591, the Piccolomini family sold the County of Celano to Camilla Peretti, sister of Pope Sixtus V. The city was at times also governed by the Savelli and Sforza families and was damaged by earthquakes in the years 1695, 1780, 1915 and 2009. From the year 1860, Celano belonged to the Kingdom of Italy.  Main sites  The square Piccolomini Castle, with round towers at the corners, was erected in its present form on the top of the San Vittorino Hill. Its construction was commissioned by Count Pietro Berardi around the year 1392, and was finished around 1451. In 1463, it was adapted on the orders of Antonio Piccolomini. On January 13, 1915, the castle was seriously damaged by a terrible earthquake that destroyed many villages in the area. The restoration began 25 years later, in 1940, but was interrupted because of the Second World War and was resumed only in 1955, with completion in 1960. Today, the castle hosts the Museum of Sacred Art of the Marsica. The beautiful castle is easily recognisable driving on the highway A25 between Rome and Pescara. Celano is home to three churches with 13th- century fa√ßades, in the style of those of L'Aquila. Culture and sport Celano F.C. Marsica plays in Serie D Group F in the 2012/2013 football season. Celano's sister city is ≈ªejtun in Malta.  Notable people  Celano is the birthplace of the Blessed Thomas of Celano, born between the years 1185 and 1190, and follower of St. Francis of Assisi, and of the classical pianist Nazzareno Carusi.

It has a population of 37,752. The small town, in the ancient periods called Garinis, was built around the X century by the Arabs, not far from Hyccara, the only Sican settlement (probably a fishing village) on the coast. It was stormed and taken by the Athenians in 415 BC, and the inhabitants, among them the famous courtesan Lais, sold as slaves. At Villagrazia Christian catacombs have been found.SICILIA. IX.

Classe di scienze morali, storiche, critiche e filologiche. Memorie, 1899 The first historical mention of a bishop of the see is in two letters of Pope Gregory the Great, in the 6th century, one addressed to Bonifacius of Reggio Calabria, the other to Barbarus of Carini. But many signs, including local catacombs, show that a Christian community existed at Carini from the 3rd century. A lead seal bears the name of a Felix, bishop of this see. One of Gregory the Great's letters show that the diocese was incorporated into that of Reggio Calabria in September 595, but by 602 it was again under its own bishop. A Bishop John of the see took part in a synod at Rome in 649. The last testimony to its existence dates from the 8th century, and the Muslim conquest of Sicily, which began in 827, brought it to an end as a residential bishopric.Paolo Bertolini, \\"Bonifacio\\" in Dizionario Biografico Treccani As a result, Carini/Hyccara/Hyccarum is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 859 Tourism and retail Tourism is an important part Carini's economy. Carini's lure for tourists is based mainly on shopping but also on its possession of other ancient and modern attractions. Carini has one of the biggest shopping areas in Sicily called the Zona Industriale where more than ten big shopping centres can be found. The Zona Industriale attracts people from the surrounding areas and beyond, especially during weekends and the summer season. Carini has two shopping malls, including one of sicily's largest, centro commerciale Poseidon. The other shopping mall is called Portobello - Le Gallerie del Risparmio. Military Architecture Carini Castle The building was erected in the late ninth and early twelfth century, certainly on a previous Arab construction, by the first Norman feudal lord Rodolfo Bonello, warrior in the retinue of Count Roger. The excavations carried out during the recent restoration, both in the east and in the north, they have surfaced walls of earlier times to the Norman. The castle has a large courtyard, where there is the residential structure made primarily in two elevations. The ground floor consists of: a room with a cross vault that contains a wall in stone, which originally served as the exterior wall. In this are visible windows and a pointed front door with splays of the old medieval structure; A large hall divided by two pointed arches with the central column; The private chapel where you can admire a beautiful wooden tabernacle of the first decade of '600, with Corinthian columns that mark prospectively space. Outside the chapel, a portal giving access to the bastion, where the remains of a perimeter wall are visible. The second floor, reached by an outside stone staircase Billiemi, architect Matteo Carnalivari, comprises: the ballroom, classic example of fifteenth-century room with coffered wooden ceiling, fireplace adorned with the emblem of La Grua and large windows with leaning seats and from the sleeping area, composed of frescoed rooms, where you can admire a beautiful eighteenth-century decorated door that characterizes the alcove. A small circular staircase leads to the kitchen, while another adjoining rooms on the upper floors. From the west side there is access to an area called \\"Foresteria.\\" A staircase leads to the castle tower or male. The continuous tower with a wooden gallery from which a mullioned window with the emblem of Abbate can observe the south side of the country. The Abbate family commanded the castle from 1283 to 1397 after Palmerio Abbate campaigned with Geovanni Procida during the War of the Sicilian Vespers. The castle was then commanded by the La Grua Talamanca family. Here is the time to cruise with plumes also ending with Billiemi stone. A scale, which no longer exists, allowing the output to the battlements of the tower. From a door, characterized by an arch lancet, you exit into a small terrace, recently created, which allows to observe the city.

Hellmann also studied at the University of Kiel. He received his diploma from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin for work on radioactive compounds under Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner. He received his Ph.D. at Stuttgart with Prof. Erich Regener for work on the decomposition of ozone √úber das Auftreten von Ionen beim Zerfall von Ozon und die Ionisation der Stratosph√§re.

In 1929 Hellmann became an assistant professor at the Leibniz University Hannover. After the Nazi rise to power, Hellmann was dismissed on 24 December 1933 as ‚Äòundesirable‚Äô because of his Jewish wife. He immigrated to the Soviet Union, taking up a position at the Karpov institute in Moscow working among other things on pseudopotentials. However, he was later denounced during the Great Purge, imprisoned on 10 May 1938 and executed on 29 May. His son, Hans Hellmann, Jr., was only allowed to leave the former Soviet Union in 1991. In science, his name is primarily associated with the Hellmann‚ÄìFeynman theorem, as well as with one of the first-ever textbooks on quantum chemistry (‚ÄòKvantovaya Khimiya‚Äô, 1937; translated into German as ‚ÄòEinfuehrung in die Quantenchemie‚Äô, Vienna, 1937). He pioneered several approaches now commonplace in quantum chemistry, notably the use of pseudopotentials.

A St√ºve diagram is one of four thermodynamic diagrams commonly used in weather analysis and forecasting. It was developed circa 1927 by the German meteorologist Georg St√ºve (1888‚Äì1935) and quickly gained widespread acceptance in the United States to plot temperature and dew point data from radiosondes. This diagram has a simplicity in that it uses straight lines for the three primary variables: pressure, temperature and potential temperature. The isotherms are straight and vertical, isobars are straight and horizontal and dry adiabats are also straight and have a 45 degree inclination to the left while moist adiabats are curved. Wind barbs are often plotted at the side of the diagram to indicate the winds at different heights they are used to save space with symbols to help in charts. However, using this configuration sacrifices the equal-area property of the original Clausius‚ÄìClapeyron relation requirements between the temperature of the environment and the temperature of a parcel of air lifted/lowered. Although it permits to analyze the cloud cover and the stability of the airmass, it thus does not permit to calculate the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). This is why the three other thermodynamic diagrams (emagrams, tephigrams, and skew-T log-P diagrams) are most often preferred, the latter in the USA nowadays.

Early life and education Mesfin Woldermariam was born on 23 April 1930 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Mesfin received his early education at Teferi Mekonnen School, and was a student of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, receiving ordination as a deacon in 1946. He completed his further education in London in 1951, and won a scholarship to study abroad. He received his BA from Punjab University, Chandigarh in 1955 and his MA and Ph.D. from Clark University in 1977 by dissertation rural vulnerability to famine in Ethiopia. Mesfin was professor of geography at Haile Selassie University (now Addis Ababa University or AAU), and for a time was head of the geography department. He was also a senior Fulbright scholar in 1971, 1986 and 1987. He retired from AAU in 1991.  Political activism  Responding to a student petition, on 8 April 2001 Mesfin and Berhanu Nega held a day-long panel discussion at the hall of the National Lottery on academic freedom. They were arrested on the allegations that this panel incited a student protest at AAU the next day, but released on bail 5 June and neither were ever tried. In November 2005, the government of Ethiopia detained Mesfin on charges of treason, genocide and outrage against the constitution, along with other leading members of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD). This charge was considered to criminalize actions of free speech, freedom of association and freedom of expression that are guaranteed by international human rights laws, and has been condemned by many international observers including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the European Union. He was held at Kaliti Prison. During his incarceration, Mesfin took part in two hunger strikes in December 2005 and January 2006, protesting his detention and trial. He later contracted pneumonia, collapsing in his prison cell 18 August, and was taken to the hospital.\\"Ethiopia: Medical concern/ Prisoner of Conscience: Professor Mesfin Woldemariam\\", Amnesty International website, Report AFR 25/024/2006 (accessed 20 May 2009) The court was supposed to deliver the verdict on 19 February 2007. However, Mesfin, and 37 others were pronounced guilty on 11 June 2007. This judgment occurred after Mesfin refused to defend himself, insisting that the arrest, charges, detention and trial was politically motivated and that the trial was not likely to be fair.

Route description  View south along CR 575 at CR 610 in Port Republic CR 575 begins at an intersection with CR 559 in Egg Harbor Township, heading north on two-lane undivided English Creek Avenue. The road runs through a mix of woods and homes, crossing CR 615 as it turns more to the northeast and crosses CR 559 Alternate. CR 575 continues to US 40/US 322 (Black Horse Pike), where it turns west to form a concurrency with that road. Here, English Creek Avenue continues north as CR 603. The Black Horse Pike, a four-lane divided highway, heads west through commercial areas, crossing into Hamilton Township and reaching the CR 646 junction. CR 575 splits from US 40/US 322 by heading northeast on Wrangleboro Road a short distance before the US 40/US 322 split. Past this intersection, CR 575 is briefly a six-lane divided highway as it intersects a ramp to and from the eastbound Atlantic City Expressway and an access road to the Hamilton Mall. The road becomes a four-lane undivided road as it continues through commercial areas and runs southeast of the former Atlantic City Race Course. Upon reaching a partial interchange with access to and from the westbound direction of the Atlantic City Expressway, CR 575 becomes two lanes again and enters woodland. The road crosses CR 563 near the Atlantic City International Airport before coming into Galloway Township. Here, the route enters wooded residential areas within the community of Pomona, intersecting CR 686 and CR 605 before crossing NJ Transit‚Äôs Atlantic City Line. The route becomes Mays Landing-Port Republic Road at the railroad crossing and continues to an intersection with US 30 (White Horse Pike). After US 30, CR 575 crosses CR 633 before leaving Pomona and meeting CR 561. The road continues through forested areas with some farms before passing near the campus of Stockton University. Past the college, the route forms a concurrency with CR 561 Alternate and reaches a complete interchange with the Garden State Parkway. This interchange provides access to and from the parkway. CR 561 Alternate and CR 575 split a short distance later, with CR 575 heading into Port Republic on Main Street. The road continues through dense woodland before making a turn to the east and passing several homes. CR 575 intersects CR 610 and turns north onto Pitney Road, intersecting CR 624 a short distance later. Leaving the center of Port Republic, the road enters rural areas again and turns northeast at the CR 650 junction. The route parallels the Garden State Parkway to the south and passes a couple businesses. CR 575 comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with US 9.

Name and symbols The oldest mention of the name Baarlo is from 1219. The oldest certificate of the bank of Baarlo dates from 25 January 1377. In 1629 for the first time it used its own seal. The seal shows the Saint Peter, holding a key in his left hand and in his right hand three ropes carrying a shield, on which a stag is shown jumping to the left. At that time, the local lord, schout or pastor sealed the certificates. History Archeological excavations have shown that at the beginning of our calendar people already had settled in Baarlo. Later the Romans came; they built to Roman road between Tongeren and Nijmegen and Oyen (between Baarlo and Kessel). In the 19th century the old church of Baarlo became too small, so the city decided to build a new one. Pierre Cuypers was the architect and the church was finished in 1878. In 1932, the priest chancel and the cross of the church were extended by Joseph Frassen. In November 1944 the church was blown up by the Germans. A restoration was not possible. Therefore, it was decided to build a new church. This work has been completed in 1955. Castles There are four castles in Baarlo. Castles d'Erp (has also been called de Borcht), Berckt, and Raay were built in the 13th century.

It is estimated that the building dates from the later tenth century, shortly after Danish raids on England. The tower The tower at Earls Barton was probably originally a tower nave, the ground floor serving as the main body of the church with a small chancel annexed to it to the east, as at St Peter's Church, Barton-upon- Humber, built at roughly the same period.Fisher, 1959, page 57 A doorway on the south side of the tower, and originally another opening on the west face, allowed access to the outside. The upper floors possibly provided accommodation for the priest or acted as a safe-haven to house treasures, although it has been pointed out that such towers would have been deathtraps in a Viking raid, with their combustible wooden floors and multiple doors.Fernie, 1983, page 136 & page 186, note 32, referring to Taylor. There is a belfry at the uppermost storey. The tower is constructed of stone rubble and rendered on the outside, and is decorated with vertical limestone pilaster strips and strapwork. At the corners of the tower, the walls are strengthened by long vertical quoin stones bedded on horizontal slabs, and hence is termed long and short work. The way in which the tower is decorated is unique to Anglo-Saxon architecture, and the decorated Anglo-Saxon tower itself is a phenomenon that occurs locally, including Barnack near Peterborough and Stowe Nine Churches in Northamptonshire. The storeys are divided by projecting stone string courses, and at each successive storey, the walls become slightly thinner, creating a step at each string course. The vertical pilaster strips continue up the tower, and are interspersed with stone strip arches at lower level and triangular decoration at upper level, in some instances resulting in a criss-cross pattern. In the 12th century the small Anglo-Saxon chancel, narrower than the tower,Richmond, 1986, page 176Fisher, 1969, page 45 was razed and replaced by a nave so that the tower now stands at the west end.Pevsner & Cherry, 1973, pages 195-196 This nave was enlarged later in the 12th century and then renovated in the 13th and early 14th centuries. The east end of the chancel is 13th century. Old door of All Saints Architectural characteristics The influence is very much Roman, and this can be seen by looking at the doors and windows of the tower. At the west doorway, pilaster strips run up the sides and continue over the head in an arch. Within this, there is an arched moulding springing from square imposts. These are decorated with vertical fluting. The jambs are of large flat stones, at right angles to the wall. The form of the jambs is Roman in origin. An example of this can be seen in the Bath House of Chesters Fort on Hadrian's Wall. Windows at low level on the south are mullioned with baluster shafts and arched lintels, and the window apertures themselves are cross-shaped. At high level, the belfry has arched five-light windows with baluster shaft mullions. The blind arcading is purely decorative, since the arches and triangles spring from string courses rather than supporting them. In fact Warwick Rodwell has suggested that the \\"hopeless jumble\\" of the arcading at Earls Barton demonstrates it was mere ornament. Rodwell suggests that the design was based on timber framing but that the parts were then assembled wrongly.Rodwell, 1986, page 174; reprinted in Karkov, 1999, page 128 The position of openings in the tower makes use of this decoration by fitting within the triangles and pilaster strips. The use of stone enabled sturdy towers to be built in this period, but the availability of stone that could be easily quarried and carved enabled towers as at Earls Barton to be decorated in such a way. The limestone at Barnack was quarried extensively from Anglo-Saxon times and throughout the Middle Ages to build churches and cathedrals including Peterborough and Ely. It is evident that Anglo-Saxon churches with long and short work and pilaster strips are distributed throughout England where this type of limestone was available, and in East Anglia where the stone was transported. Henry Bird In 1935, Henry Bird painted the 15th century rood screen. Its upper parts contain butterfly species that are local to the area.David Buckman (April 22, 2000) Henry Bird Obituary The Independent History To the north of All Saints' Church, Earls Barton, a mound and ditch almost abuts the church. Pevsner supposes that the lord of the manor regarded the church as an encroachment and planned to demolish it.Pevsner & Cherry, 1973, page 196 Following the Norman conquest of England an Anglo-Saxon called Waltheof had become the first Earl of Northampton. He married the niece of William I, Judith, and she was granted land at Buarton later named Earls Barton. The mound may have been part of a manor. It is reasonable to suggest that All Saints' was originally linked to a manor, rather than to a monastery. Earthworks are also present adjacent to the church at Sulgrave in Northamptonshire, where the remains of an Anglo-Saxon hall have been discovered, so churches linked to manors were not unknown at the time of the building of All Saints'.

Fletcher as a young man Joseph Smith Fletcher (7 February 1863 ‚Äì 30 January 1935) was an English journalist and author. He wrote more than 230 books on a wide variety of subjects, both fiction and non-fiction, and was one of the most prolific English writers of detective fiction.  Early life and education  Fletcher was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, the son of a clergyman. His father died when he was eight months old, and after which his grandmother raised him on a farm in Darrington, near Pontefract. He was educated at Silcoates School in Wakefield, and after some study of law, he became a journalist.  Writing career  At age 20, Fletcher began working in journalism, as a sub-editor in London. He subsequently returned to his native Yorkshire, where he worked first on the Leeds Mercury using the pseudonym A Son of the Soil, and then as a special correspondent for the Yorkshire Post covering Edward VII's coronation in 1902. Fletcher's first books published were poetry. He then moved on to write numerous works of historical fiction and history, many dealing with Yorkshire, which led to his selection as a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. Michael Sadleir stated that Fletcher's historical novel, When Charles I Was King (1892), was his best work. Fletcher wrote several novels of rural life in imitation of Richard Jefferies, beginning with The Wonderful Wapentake (1894). In 1914, Fletcher wrote his first detective novel and went on to write over a hundred more, many featuring the private investigator Ronald Camberwell. Fletcher is sometimes incorrectly described as a \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\" author, but he is in fact an almost exact contemporary of Conan Doyle. Most of his detective fiction works considerably pre-date that era, and even those few published within it do not conform to the closed form and strict rules professed, if not unfailingly observed, by the Golden Age writers.  Personal life  He was married to the Irish writer Rosamond Langbridge, with whom he had one son, Rev. Valentine Fletcher, who has subsequently held various ministries across Yorkshire, including Bradford and Sedbergh.  Death  Fletcher died in Surrey 1935, one week short of his 72nd birthday. He was survived by his wife Rosamond and son Valentine.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0282024/bio bio  Works  = Novels = *Frank Carisbroke's Stratagem (1888) *Andrewlina (1889) *Mr. Spivey's Clerk (1890) *When Charles the First Was King (1892) *In the Days of Drake (1895) *Where Highways Cross (1895) *Mistress Spitfire (1896) *Baden Powell of Mafeking (1900) *Lucian the Dreamer (1903) *Perris of the Cherry-Trees (1913) *The King versus Wargrave (1915) *The Rayner-Slade Amalgamation (1917) *Paul Campenhaye (1918) *The Chestermarke Instinct (1918) *The Borough Treasurer (1919) *The Middle Temple Murder (1919) *The Talleyrand Maxim (1919) *Scarhaven Keep (1920) *The Herapath Property (1920) *The Lost Mr. Linthwaite (1920) *The Orange-Yellow Diamond (1920) *The Markenmore Mystery (1921) *The Root of All Evil (1921) *Wrychester Paradise (1921) *In the Mayor's Parlour (1922) *Ravensdene Court (1922) *The Middle of Things (1922) *The Charing Cross Mystery (1923) *The Kang-He Vase (1924) *The Safety Pin (1924) *Sea Fog (1925) *The Bedford Row Mystery (1925) *The Cartwright Gardens Murder (1925) *The Mill of Many Windows (1925) *Dead Men's Money (1928) *Murder at Wrides Park (1931) *Murder in Four Degrees (1931) *Murder of the Ninth Baronet (1932) *The Borgia Cabinet (1932) *The Solution of a Mystery (1932) *Green Ink and other stories (1935) *Todmanhawe Grange (1937) = Short Stories = *Miscellaneous Stories (1907) *Mr. Poskitt's Nightcaps (1910) *The Secret of the Barbican and Other Stories (1924) = Poetry = *The Juvenile Poems of Joseph S.

The comune has 27 named frazione (wards). History Bagni di Lucca has been known for its thermal springs since the Etruscan and Roman ages. The place was noted for the first time in an official document of 983 AD as \\"Corsena\\", with reference to a donation by the Bishop Teudogrimo of the territory of Bagni di Lucca to Fraolmo of Corvaresi. The area is rich in chestnut forests, mentioned by the Roman poet Virgil. Some of the earliest accounts of occupation were by the Lombards. Their leader Alboin occupied the whole Serchio Valley for many years, building guard towers that were later converted to churches. One of them is Pieve di Controne. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, the village became a feudal property of the Suffredinghi, then the Porcareschi, and later the Lupari families. In the 12th century, the commune of Lucca occupied the territory of Bagni di Lucca. In 1308 Lucca unified the community of Bagni di Lucca with those of the nearby villages, forming the \\"Vicarship of the Lima Valley\\" with each hamlet governed by a member of the Bagni di Lucca parish. These members are still responsible for the monitoring of religious festivals and preservation of old churches. Lucca restored the town in the 14th century, recognising the revenue from visitors to the thermal springs of Bagni di Lucca. The commune developed it as a destination for visitors, including international figures. Bagni di Lucca with its thermal baths reached its greatest fame during the 19th century, especially during the French occupation. The town became the summer residence of the court of Napoleon and his sister, Elisa Baciocchi. A casino was built, where gambling was part of social nightlife, as well as a large hall for dances. At the Congress of Vienna (1814), the Duchy of Lucca was assigned to Maria-Louisa of Bourbon as ruler of Parma.Starke M. Travels in Europe 9th Edition, John Murray, 1837, p48 Bagni de Lucca continued as a popular summer resort, particularly for the English, who built a Protestant church there.Starke (1837), pp 106-111 In 1847 Lucca with Bagni di Lucca was ceded to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, under the domain of the Grand Duke Leopold II of Lorraine.Baedeker K. (1899) Northern Italy 11th Edition, Leipsic p395 His rule started a period of decline for the springs and casino as a destination, since he was used to a secluded life. In 1853 the casino was closed. It was reopened after 1861, when Lucca became part of the unified Kingdom of Italy.Baedeker (1899), p400 =World War II= During the German invasion of Italy in the 1940s, Bagni di Lucca was occupied along with many other towns along the Gothic Line in the Apennines. Several houses and mansions in the area were used as residences for German soldiers, and some residents born after 1940 in this region have German ancestry. During the Italian Social Republic, a puppet state of Germany which existed from September 1943 until May 1945, a concentration camp for Jews was set up in Bagni di Lucca, where both Italian and foreign Jews were interned from December 1943 to January 1944. More than 100 people were interned in squalid conditions in the Hotel Le Terme. Some managed to escape, but most were sent to Auschwitz on 30 January 1944. Some Jews were moved between this camp and the Colle di Compecito (PG60) camp near Lucca. Hot springs The commune is known for its springs, in the valley of the Lima River, a tributary of the Serchio. The district is known in the early history of Lucca as the Vicaria di Val di Lima. Ponte Serraglio is the principal village of the warm spring area, but there are warm springs and baths also at Villa, Docce Bassi, and Bagno Caldo. The springs do not seem to have been known to the Romans. Bagno a Corsena is first mentioned in 1284 by Guidone de Corvaia, a Pisan historian (Muratori, R.I.S. vol. xxii.). Several writers and poets have since visited, including Dante on his way to Northern Italy. Fallopius, who gave the springs credit for the cure of his own deafness, sounded their praises in 1569; and they have been more or less in fashion since. The temperature of the water varies from . In all cases, the springs give off carbonic acid gas and contain lime, magnesium and sodium products. The thermal springs were brought to much attention by natural medicinal doctor Montecatini of the University of Pisa in which \\"Montecatini Terme\\" is named after. Main sights Bagni di Lucca by night . In the valley of the Serchio, about below Ponte a Serraglio, is the medieval Ponte della Maddalena (circa 1100), with a lofty central arch. It is also known as Ponte del Diavolo. Il Ponte del Diavolo is known to have a few origins, however there is one main story. It is said that when a construction worker was working on the bridge late at night, the devil came up to him and offered assistance if he could claim the first passenger on the bridge. The agreement was made and when the bridge was finally built, a little dog wandered over the bridge and mysteriously disappeared. Many years later, another arch was added to the bridge for trains to pass by, this bridge is regarded as the most notable sight in the Bagni di Lucca area. The Ponte delle Catene is a 19th-century suspension bridge. The pieve (rural parish church) of San Cassiano was built before 722. It has the painting St. Martin Riding by Jacopo della Quercia and others from the Renaissance. More Renaissance works hang in the parish church of San Paolo a Vico Pancellorum, which dates back to the year 873. The war memorial in San Cassiano is dedicated to the casualties of war from World Wars I and II from that town and its seven districts (Chiesa, Livizzano, Coccolaio, Capella, Cembroni, Vizzata, and Piazza). Every year a festival is held at the parish church and in the town of Controne to honor the 16th-century miracle that nobody in the town was infected with plague. A cross is carried and people march around the village rejoicing. The hospital in the frazione of Bagno Caldo was built in 1826 by the philanthropy of Nicholas Demidoff. The English Protestant church has been converted to the Bagni di Lucca Bibiloteca (library), holding archives and records dating back several centuries. Additionally, temporary villas of previous poets, writers, etc. are also main sights. One of the main villas is that of the poets Robert Browning and his wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who spent a lot of time in the town. =English Cemetery= The English Cemetery The small English cemetery, recently restored, provides a final place of rest for the many foreign Protestant visitors who died in Bagni di Lucca. Some of the more notable graves, in order of the date of death, are of: Alexander Henry Haliday (1807-1870), Irish entomologist; Charles Isidore Hemans (1817-1876), English antiquary; Mahlon Dickerson Eyre (1821-1882), American art collector; English novelist Maria Louise Rame, better known as Ouida (1839-1908); Rose Cleveland (1846-1918), de facto First Lady of the United States; Nelly Erichsen (1862-1918), English illustrator and painter; Edward Perry Warren (1860-1928), English art collector; and Evangeline Marrs Whipple (1862-1930), American philanthropist and author. Modern Economy Teatro Accademico The local economy is mainly based on tourism, attracted to the thermal springs, the historic architecture, and numerous quality hotels. Local industries produce paper and building materials, as well as machines. Many residents of the surrounding area produce their own and survive off local agriculture, however, there is a supermarket in the area, a few restaurants, cafes, and two weekend markets that bring foods and vegetable and fruits of all sorts to the public. Like many towns in Italy though, business has not been so great in Bagni di Lucca and local industries are moving to bigger areas and metropolises such as Milan. The population of the area is somewhat stable and the countryside is very quiet; tourism is and probably will be for a while the main source of income for Bagni di Lucca businessmen and workers. Transportation The main road that passes through Bagni di Lucca is SS12 which connected the Grand Duchy of Lucca to the Grand Duchy of Modena. There are several commuter buses that serve the commune of Lucca and Florence to the area. There is a train that goes through Bagni di Lucca and stops in the Fornoli section of town. Automobile is the best way to travel through Bagni di Lucca and to other hamlets on the outskirts of Bagni di Lucca town central.

Other products have included headphones, Digital-Analog Converters (DACs), CD players, Bluetooth Receivers, ‚Äòall-in-one systems‚Äô (including Phono turntable). Founded in the United Kingdom in 1982, they are known for their unusual industrial design, Nuvistor tube use, Class-AB amplification and exquisite sound  History  Musical Fidelity was founded in 1982 by Antony Michaelson, a clarinettist and Hi-Fi enthusiast, following his exit from Michaelson & Austin, a predecessor company of which he was a partner. Musical Fidelity's first product was \\"The Preamp\\", which incorporated moving coil and moving magnet pre-amplification and a single line-level ‚ÄòTuner‚Äô input. This was originally designed to overcome his dissatisfaction with the Michaelson & Austin TVP-1 pre- amplifier. The first batch of ‚ÄúThe Preamp‚Äù were made on Michaelson's home kitchen table and sold out almost at once through a local dealer. The dealer asked for more product, which resulted in Michaelson making the decision to go into full-time production.Interview with Mr. Michaelson, 3/6/2018 This was followed by the ‚ÄòDr Thomas‚Äô power amplifier, designed by Dr Martin Vaughan Thomas, capable of outputting 100-plus watts. Later products included the Preamp II, and the Typhoon Power amplifier. From there, Michaelson commissioned a seemingly endless variety and range of new products using a wide variety of circuit concepts and technologies. Many of these became significant Hi-Fi milestones.  Significant products  Musical Fidelity is probably best known for its A1 integrated amplifier, a Class AB amplifier, rated at a rather low 20W per channel but was reputed by many to produce a very sweet, authentic sound, reminiscent of tube amplifiers. This was launched in 1985 and sold over 100,000 units over its lifetime. In 1986, the A370 power amplifier was launched ‚Äì at that time unusual (in the UK) for being a rack-mountable domestic amplifier. It produced 185 Watts per channel and was biased - like all Musical Fidelity power amplifiers, into Class AB. These were the first of their type to be made by a UK Hi-Fi company. Then followed a range of well received loudspeakers, the MC series (designed by Martin Colloms) and the Reference series, featuring 'TPX' polypropylene drivers. A year later, the Digilog was launched, one of the first stand-alone production DACs. In the late 1980s Musical Fidelity introduced further amplifiers, including the P170 and high-powered rack mount style amplifiers, including the P270, A370 (all featuring Hitachi lateral MOSFETs) and the SA470, SA570. In the early nineties, Musical Fidelity released the P180, with CRPS (Choke Regulated Power Supply). This was possibly the first time bifilar wound coils had been combined with transistor electronics. This design innovation helped suppress electro-magnetic radiation frequencies (EMF), reducing the amount of potential noise interference into the audio circuits . In 1992, the A1000 was launched ‚Äì one of the first 'super integrated' amplifiers, with a full range of line level inputs coupled to a Class AB power amplifier section producing 50W / channel into 8 ohms. Initially it was only made for Japan but later was well received around the world. The X series was launched in 1997 consisting of a range of cute extruded cylindrical add-on components, which later spawned the XA series. The units consisted of various amplifiers, Digital-to-analogue converters, Phono stages, tuners and CD players and ancillary power supplies. The NuVista preamp was introduced in 1997, the first modern, mass-produced audio product using Nuvistor tubes, which were miniature metal-ceramic enclosed vacuum tubes manufactured by RCA . These were followed by power and integrated amplifiers, with ancillary power supplies. Numerous products have descended from it, such as the Tri-Vista 21 ‚ÄòSuper DAC‚Äô, introduced in 2002, culminating in the latest being the NuVista 800. The kW Pre- and Power Amp was introduced in 2003. The power amplifier was then the highest power audiophile-grade power amp ever made commercially by a UK audiophile company, producing 1 kW of power per channel into 8 ohms. Notably, two mono-blocs and their power supply weighed in at 129 kG. It was followed by the Titan, an upgrade from the kW. In 2015, the Merlin was released, a multi-format music system that came with a turntable, wireless streaming and a pair of unique speakers, allowing users to play vinyl records and stream digital music over high quality apt-X Bluetooth, in a very compact form factor. As of 2018 , the products consist of the Nu-Vista, M8, M6, M5si, M3, MX, LX2, and V90 Series as well as the Encore Streaming Music servers. Most of the series provide a mix of Phono stages, integrated amplifiers, DACs, CD players and Headphone amplifiers. The Nu-Vista series continues in the tradition of using a mix of Nuvistor tubes, transistors and Digital technology.

Despite this, Musical Fidelity products generally displayed a sweet, easy going sound quality. Although most reviews identified this quality with MF's products, some did not approve of it. Michaelson thought that for best results, Hi-Fi should not need much set-up and tweaking. He strongly disapproved of what he called 'cable madness'. His refusal to accept the prevailing zeitgeist of cable worship frequently landed him in disputes with a variety of Hi-Fi luminaries. He relished the disagreements. Over time, his view has been borne out by the waning of the market for high- end interconnect and speaker cables sold at very high prices.  Change of ownership  In 2017, Michaelson decided to retire. A search was conducted for a suitable partner to take over the brand name and continue with the heritage. Eventually he came to an agreement with Heinz Lichtenegger of Audio Tuning (also the owner of Pro-ject) and on 14 May 2018 they took over the brand and its intellectual property.

Maddaloni in the foreground, Mount Vesuvius and Capri in the background. Main sights The city is at the base of one of the Tifata hills, the towers of its medieval castle and the Church of San Michele crowning the heights above. The fine old palace of the Caraffa family (once dukes of Maddaloni), the old college now named after Giordano Bruno, and the institute for the sons of soldiers are the chief points of interest. The Gothic church of Santa Margherita has a series of 15th-century frescoes by the Florentine painter Giovanni Balducci. The church of the Annunziata has a series of early 17th century paintings that decorate the rich wooden ceiling. Many of the works were patronized by the local feudal lords, the Carafa family. The town has two museums, the Museo Civico and the Museo Archeologico, which contains pre-Roman tombs and objects from the ancient city of Calatia. There are many important schools in Maddaloni. The \\"Convitto Nazionale Giordano Bruno\\" is the oldest public secondary school in the province of Caserta. It was founded in 1807 in the former Franciscan convent. The great hall has a large painted decoration spanning . The \\"Villaggio dei Ragazzi\\" was originally a school for orphans founded in 1947 by local priest Don Salvatore D'Angelo.

I am everywhere) was a French newspaper founded by Jean Fayard, first published on 29 November 1930. It was placed under the direction of Pierre Gaxotte until 1939. Journalists of the paper included Lucien Rebatet, , the illustrator Ralph Soupault, and the Belgian correspondent Pierre Daye. Interwar In its very beginning, Je suis partout was centered on covering international topics, without displaying extremism, antisemitism, or even a consistently right-wing approach. However, the group of editors was heavily influenced by the ideas of Charles Maurras and the integralist Action Fran√ßaise, and the ideology quickly spilled into the editorial content, as the more moderate journalists quit in protest. The paper became a staple of anti-parliamentarianism, nationalism, and criticism of \\"decadent\\" Third Republic institutions and culture, becoming close to fascist movements of the era, French and foreign alike. It clearly supported Benito Mussolini as of October 1932, when Italian politics were awarded a special issue. Je suis partout was favorable to the Spanish Falange, the Romanian Iron Guard, the Belgian L√©on Degrelle's Rexism, as well as to Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists. From 1936, it also opened to Nazism and Adolf Hitler. Despite its international connections, Je suis partout did not recommend copying over local origin in establishing a Fascist r√©gime: \\"We will regard foreign fascism only through French fascism, the only real fascism\\" (14 April 1939). Thus, it held Jacques Doriot in esteem for his attempts to unite the French far right into a single Front. The antisemitic rhetoric of the paper exploded after the Stavisky Affair and the attempted coup d'√©tat introduced by the far right rally in front of the Palais Bourbon on 6 February 1934 (see: 6 February 1934 crisis). It turned vitriolic after the forming of the left-wing Popular Front government under the Jewish L√©on Blum (1936). From 1938 on, Je suis partout matched the racist propaganda in Nazi Germany by publishing two special issues, Les Juifs (\\"The Jews\\") and Les Juifs et la France (\\"The Jews and France\\"). The extreme attack caused the publishers Fayard to cut links with the paper, and it was sold to a new board - which included the Argentine Charles Lescat (who was, according to his own depiction, \\"a fascist as genuine as he is calm\\"). Shortly before World War II and the German occupation in 1940, the paper was banned. Collaboration It was published again from 1941, and its ultra-collaborationist stances attracted the harsh criticism of Maurras, who repudiated the paper. Je suis partout triumphed as the voice of far right forces, and published calls for the murder of Jews and Third Republic political figures: \\"The death of men to which we owe so many mournings... all French people are demanding it\\" (6 September 1941). It exercised an influence over an intellectual and young audience, going from 46,000 issues in 1939 to 250,000 in 1942. Robert Brasillach was its editor-in-chief from June 1937 to September 1943 (he was to be executed for treason in 1945). Brasillach was believed to be too lenient, and was replaced with Pierre-Antoine Cousteau, brother of Jacques Cousteau. Cousteau aligned Je suis partout with the Nazi leadership, went against its roots by adhering to Nazi anti-intellectualism, and opened itself to advertising for the Waffen-SS and the L√©gion des Volontaires Fran√ßais. Several of its editors joined either the Parti Populaire Fran√ßais or the Milice. It continued to be published as late as August 1944 (the moment of the Liberation of Paris). References *P.-M.

Gallarate (Lombard: Galaraa) is a city and comune of Alto Milanese of Lombardy and of Milan metropolitan area, northern Italy, in the Province of Varese. It has a population of some 54,000 people. It is the junction of railways to Varese, Laveno and Arona (for the Simplon). Some to the west are the electric works of Vizzola, where 23,000 hp are derived from the river Ticino. Its territory is crossed by the river Arnetta, and belongs to the Ticino River Natural Park. The city had a strong textile industry in the first part of the 19th century. In common with other nearby cities, such as Casorate Sempione and Samarate, its name comes from Latin. History Founded by the Gauls and later conquered by the Romans, Gallarate was mentioned as an important vicus or village in documents dating back to the Roman conquest of what was then called Gallia Cisalpina. After the Carolingian conquest of northern-central Italy, a castle was erected upon the remains of the original Roman fortifications located beside the still existing Basilica of Santa Maria. The castle has disappeared, but its ancient location is identified through the city's topography and by the street name Via Postcastello. After the obliteration of Castelseprio by Ottone Visconti in 1287, Gallarate became the capital of the vast Seprio county. During these years, Gallarate saw a period of prosperity and economic growth that would last for the rest of Visconti control, until the beginning of French rule two centuries later (1498). Documents in the National Archives refer to Gallarate as an important centre of commercial exchange between both Italian and foreign markets, particularly for cotton, drapes, flax and textiles. Distinguished families such as the Rosnati, Reina, Masera, Palazzi, Macchi, Curioni, Mari and the Guenzati represented the nobility and the merchant classes. This period was also noted as a time of great civic improvement and the beginning of Gallarate as a centre of industrial activity. In the late 15th century, the city fell under foreign domination, initially under the Spanish and then under the French (and then again Spanish and their Austrian successors), a condition which lasted until the 19th century. In between this political instability, Gallarate became a private fief of some of the competing noble Italian families such as the Bentivoglio, Pallavicino, Caracciolo, Altemps, Visconti, and Castelbarco. Gallarate became a part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1859 and received the honorary title of city with a royal decree on 19 December 1860. By the latter half of the 19th century, modern industry had begun to take over many areas of Italy. In a few decades, Gallarate became an important industrial city. This period was also marked by heavy social tensions brought about by the rapid political and economic changes wrought by Gallarate's own industrial revolution. Nowadays, Gallarate's industrial structure no longer includes these giant industrial powerhouses of the past. Their existence, however, is still marked out by the presence of the high chimneys, which are still visible along Gallarate's skyline. Many of the old Liberty style buildings, where thousands of Gallaratesi worked during the past century and a half, have been turned into new modern multi-level shopping centres and plazas.

The highway extends from Route 37 in Toms River Township to Route 27 in Princeton. Though it is designated a north‚Äìsouth county route by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), it is signed both as north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest inconsistently. Route description =Ocean and Monmouth counties= CR 549 Spur/CR 571 northbound past Route 37 in Toms RiverCR 571 begins at an intersection with Route 37 in Toms River, Ocean County, heading north on four-lane divided Fischer Boulevard concurrent with CR 549 Spur. The road continues north through business areas, with the median turning into a center left-turn lane. The routes turn northwest through residential and commercial areas along with some marshland from the adjacent Barnegat Bay to the east, with alternating segments of median and center left-turn lane. CR 571 splits from CR 549 Spur by heading west onto two-lane undivided Bay Avenue into areas of homes. The road intersects CR 627 before turning more to the northwest and becoming four lanes at the CR 22 junction. The route widens into a divided highway as it passes between the Ocean County Mall to the north and the Seacourt Pavilion shopping center to the south and intersects CR 549 at an at-grade cloverleaf interchange. After this, CR 571 becomes Bey Lea Road and becomes undivided again as it passes through more wooded areas of development, with the northbound direction narrowing to one lane at the CR 18 junction as it turns west. After crossing CR 623, the road becomes three lanes, with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane, as it heads northwest past more businesses on Indian Head Road. The route runs west near a few homes before passing under the Garden State Parkway and reaching the U.S. Route 9 (US 9) junction. CR 571 westbound past CR 527 in Toms RiverCR 571 becomes four lanes at this point and passes residences to the north and a shopping center to the south prior to intersecting CR 527. CR 571 turns northwest to join CR 527 on Whitesville Road, passing wooded areas of housing developments. CR 527 splits from CR 571 by turning north, and CR 571 continues northwest along Toms River Road, entering Manchester Township. The road continues through forested development as it comes to the Route 70 junction. At this point, the route narrows to two lanes and passes through more wooded areas with occasional residences, crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary line. CR 571 crosses CR 547 before heading into Jackson Township. The route runs through forested areas of the Pine Barrens with intermittent residential development for several miles, eventually turning north and coming to the junction with CR 528 in the community of Cassville. The road becomes Cassville Road at this intersection and passes Cassville Lake as it comes to the CR 638 intersection. CR 571 continues north past more wooded areas of homes before coming to an intersection with CR 526. At this point, CR 526 turns north to form a concurrency with CR 571 and the two routes continue through forests on Trenton-Lakewood Road, passing under Interstate 195 (I-195) prior to coming to the CR 537 junction. CR 571 northbound past the CR 1 intersection in Millstone Township At the CR 537 intersection, CR 526/CR 571 continues into Millstone Township in Monmouth County and continues northwest through more forested areas of homes before CR 526 splits from CR 571 by heading west. CR 571 heads north along Millstone Road and comes to the junction with CR 524. Here, the route turns west to join CR 524 on Stage Coach Road, making a turn to the north at an intersection with Red Valley Road/Spring Road. The routes make a sharp turn to the southwest before CR 571 splits from CR 524 by heading north on Rising Sun Tavern Road. The route runs through forests with some homes and farms, curving to the northwest and entering Roosevelt, where it becomes Clarksburg Road and continues through wooded areas with some homes. CR 571 turns north onto South Rochdale Avenue and passes more residences. The route crosses back into Millstone Township and heads into areas of farmland and woodland, turning northwest at the CR 1 junction. =Mercer County= Route 64 and CR 571 heading northbound in West Windsor towards Penns Neck CR 571 enters East Windsor Township in Mercer County and becomes Etra Road in the community of Etra, as it continues through a mix of farms, woods, and homes. The route turns north before curving northwest near Etra Lake and passing over the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). The road heads west into Hightstown and passes homes before reaching an intersection with CR 539. CR 571 turns north to follow CR 539 on South Main Street at this point. Upon reaching the commercial downtown of Hightstown, northbound CR 539/CR 571 join Route 33 as it merges from Mercer Street onto Main Street. Traveling southbound, CR 539/571 follow Route 33 onto Mercer Street for one block before turning east onto Ward Street and then south onto South Main Street; those wanting to travel west onto Route 33 from northbound CR 539/571 must also use Ward Street. CR 571 then leaves the concurrency by turning to the west on Stockton Street. The route passes more residences, the Stockton Street Historic District, before crossing back into East Windsor Township and intersecting US 130. The road heads northwest and becomes Hightstown Road at this point and passes through commercial areas with a few farms, widening to four lanes just before the junction with the western terminus of Route 133. A short distance later, CR 571 crosses CR 535 and heads west into West Windsor Township, passing through a mix of farmland, woodland, and residences. The road enters areas of residential subdivisions after it crosses Southfield Road, crosses Bear Brook, and then turns northwest as it comes to another junction with CR 526. Route 27 in Princeton. At this point, CR 526 forms a signed (but not officially designatedNJDOT County Route 526 Straight Line Diagram (PDF) (NJDOT) (Straight line diagram)) concurrency with CR 571 for the remainder of the route, with the road intersecting CR 607 prior to crossing CR 638. The route narrows to two lanes and turns north at this point, passing a mix of homes and businesses as it reaches the CR 615 junction. At this point, CR 571 becomes part of the state-maintained Route 64, a two-lane divided highway that carries the route over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor near the Princeton Junction Station at West Windsor. Past the terminus of Route 64, CR 571 continues northwest on two-lane undivided Washington Road, passing through wooded residential areas before intersecting US 1 at the modified Penns Neck Circle. Past the intersection, the road runs through the historic Washington Road Elm All√©e, rows of Princeton elm trees that line both sides of the road. The road descends a hill before crossing the Delaware and Raritan Canal and Lake Carnegie into Princeton. At this point, CR 571 runs through the heart of the Princeton University campus, reaching its northern terminus at Route 27 (Nassau Street). History Washington Road, part of CR 571, from Streicker bridge as it passes through the campus of Princeton University From Hightstown to Millstone Township, the road was built by the Hightstown and Perrineville Turnpike Company, chartered in 1859. Their road also extended east along what is now Perrineville Road. When it was first designated in the early 1950s, CR 571 ran entirely in Ocean County from then- Dover Township to CR 526 in Jackson Township. The modern-day route north of there followed CR 526 to Carrs Tavern, CR 524 in Clarksburg, municipal and minor county routes in Monmouth and Mercer Counties, and from Hightstown to Princeton what was then designated CR 539. By 1962, the designation entered Monmouth County, and by 1976, CR 571 from Hightstown to Princeton was in- place. View east along CR 571 in Hightstown In the summer of 2012, NJDOT installed barriers at the Penns Neck Circle to prevent \\"left-turning\\" traffic from US 1 in either direction onto CR 571. In conjunction with other blockades of nearby intersections, this 12-week pilot program was meant to improve traffic flows along the congested US 1. Though the project was improving travel times along US 1, motorists wanting to make the previously-allowed left turns were making U-turns and K-turns in the driveways of Penns Neck residences instead of using nearby interchanges to U-turn on US 1 itself. The project ended a month early after residents complaints and local politicians opposition to the project were heard. NJDOT has proposed a realignment of CR 571 in the Penns Neck neighborhood of West Windsor. The various alternatives would have begun near the northern terminus of Route 64 at a new grade- separated interchange to provide access to the Princeton Junction Station and the existing Washington Road, run north of Penns Neck through the David Sarnoff Research, cross US 1 at a new grade-separated interchange, and return to the existing alignment south of the Millstone River.

It is on the right bank of the Mincio River near the bridge. The town is part of the region known as Alto Mantovano (Upper Mantuan). History It was founded as a Roman colony in the early 2nd century BC as a defensive outpost on the Mincio crossing along the Via Postumia from Cremona to Verona. In the late 5th century AD, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it became a fortress of the Ostrogoths, from whom the current name perhaps derives. Later it was conquered by the Lombards and the Franks. In the later Middle Ages it was held by the Canossa family as part of the Holy Roman Empire, and then it established itself as a free commune. In the 15th century Goito was contended between the Visconti and Gonzaga families, until, after a battle fought on 14 June 1453, it became a possession of marquis Ludovico III Gonzaga. He built here a residence (in which the painter Andrea Mantegna worked in 1463-64), restored the fortifications and built the Naviglio di Goito canal, and died here by plague in 1478. Goito maintained its prosperity under dukes Guglielmo and Vincenzo I Gonzaga. After the decline of the Gonzaga lordship, and struck by an earthquake on 5 July 1693, in 1708 it was annexed to the Austrian-held Duchy of Milan. In the late 18th century it was captured by the French and later retaken by the Austrians. During the First Italian War of Independence, the Piedmontese forces won two actions (8 April and 30 May 1848, called the battle of Goito) over the Austrians here.

It is set in a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on the slope of the North Downs. The village's Conservation Area boasts some excellent buildings and gardens, and the Eastling Manor House.  St Mary's Church  The village church of St Mary's is believed to have been built on the foundations of an earlier place of worship before the 11th century. The oldest surviving parts are the base of the southwest tower, the nave and the western part of the chancel. The chancel was extended eastwards in the 14th century to create a sanctuary. About the same time, the St Katherine Chapel and an arcade was added to the southeast corner. The nave, north aisle and south arcade were substantially rebuilt by the architect R.C. Hussey in 1855-56; the west porch added and the nave re-roofed. St Mary's box pews, pulpit, lectern, rector's stall and choir stalls all date from that era.  Eastling school  Eastling County Primary School opened on Kettle Hill on 7 February 1881 with 80 children. The first head was Bessie Higham; since February 2002 it has been Dave Walsh. It replaced a schoolhouse built before 1842 in Newnham Lane and which doubled as a church hall. Currently (January 2020) the school has a roll fluctuating around 100 pupils with spaces for 15 new pupils each year at ages 4 and 5.

The film begins with Rouch and Morin discussing whether it is possible to act sincerely on camera. A cast of real-life individuals are then introduced and led by the filmmakers to discuss topics related to French society and working-class happiness. At the movie's end, the filmmakers show their subjects the footage and have them discuss the level of reality that they thought the movie achieved. This feature was filmed in Paris and Saint-Tropez, France. Rouch used synchronized sound, using a 16 mm camera connected through pilottone with a prototype of Nagra III, a transistorized tape recorder with electronic speed control developed by Stefan Kudelski. The film is widely regarded as structurally innovative and an example of cin√©ma v√©rit√© and direct cinema. The term \\"cinema v√©rit√©\\" was suggested by the film's publicist and coined by Rouch, highlighting a connection between film and its context, a fact Brault confirmed in an interview after a 2011 screening of Chronique d'un √©t√© at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto.

The name \\"Noblesse\\" comes from the French term Noblesse oblige, which means \\"nobility obliges\\". History A Noblesse cigarette. Noblesse was first launched in 1952 in a distinct green, 80mm, 'soft-pack' which has never been dramatically changed. It is the oldest in Dubek's product line. The cigarette also has the highest tar (19 mg) and nicotine (1.3 mg) amounts available on the Israeli cigarette market. Despite Dubek's original plans to make Nobblesse cigarettes a premium priced cigarette, its cheap price made it popular with generations of soldiers, Kibbutzniks and even prisoners who wanted to smoke but not burn too much money. However, in more recent times, the Noblesse brand is barely smoked in the Israel Defense Forces anymore, as it holds a 1% sale rate amongst the soldiers and other brands like Marlboro and Camel have become more popular over the years. Dubek has since made three additions to the Noblesse family: A lower nicotine/tar blend in a light-green softpack branded Noblesse Virginia Blend, an even lower nicotine/tar blend in a blue/white flip-top pack branded American Blue and Noblesse Golden Virginia which is sold in a bright orange soft pack. Noblesse cigarettes are also distributed or sold by the Israel Defense Forces to imprisoned soldiers within Israeli military prisons. Noblesse cigarettes have a special place in the Israeli history, as a feature of young people who want to realize the values of the 1960s \\"Sex and drugs and rock and roll phase\\" Apparently this place was given to the brand due to the distribution of free Noblesse cigarettes in Kibbutz, which has become a feature of the youth and the Nahal. In March of 2013, it was reported that Dubek contacted Ben Ezra, the Kosher supervisor, to approve their brands (which are Noblesse, Time and Golf) as Kosher for Passover. During the holiday, Jewish law forbids Chametz ‚Äì anything consisting of grains that may have come in contact with water, starting the process of fermentation. Some Jews, including many who are not religiously observant the rest of the year, spend weeks before Passover cleaning their homes and belongings to rid them of any morsel of food considered to be Chametz. In January 2015, as taxes on cigarettes were increased in Israel, Noblesse cigarettes were sold significantly less as consumers chose to buy cheaper brands. Marketing Noblesse has appeared in some Israeli newspapers via advertisements. In 2015, limited edition packs were released, featuring a special camouflage pattern on all the pack variants. Markets Noblesse is or was sold in Israel, the Netherlands, Denmark (As Nobless), Switzerland, Canada and Argentina.

Lawrence Blochman was born in San Diego, California, to Lucien A. Blochman, a banker, and his wife Haidee Goldtree. He began writing early. As a junior at San Diego High School, Blochman reported school sports for the San Diego Evening Tribune and, as a senior, he replaced the Tribune sports editor who had left to serve in World War I. Blochman then attended the University of California, Berkeley where he edited the college newspaper, the Daily Californian. In the summer he served as a police reporter for the Tribune and a courthouse reporter for the San Diego Sun. He graduated from college in 1921. After graduation, he tried to write his \\"way around the world,\\" working in Tokyo for the Japan Advertiser, in Hong Kong for the South China Morning Post, in Shanghai for the Far Eastern Review, in Calcutta for The Englishman, and in Paris for the Chicago Tribune. He returned to San Diego as city editor of the Sun in 1924. In 1926, he married Marguerite Maillard in Paris. Writing as Lawrence G. Blochman, he published more than 50 books, including many mystery and detective novels, as well as several hundred short stories, novelettes, and articles. Several of his stories were made into films, television programs, and radio shows. He also translated more than a dozen books and detective stories from the French, including novels by the celebrated Belgian writer Georges Simenon. In 1948, Blochman served as the fourth president of the Mystery Writers of America, following Baynard Kendrick, Ellery Queen, and Hugh Pentecost.

He graduated from Central High School of Philadelphia (a degree- granting institution rather than an ordinary high school) in 1864. He received both his Bachelor of Arts and master's degree from the same Central High School, where he then became professor of civil engineering for a short period before holding its chair of Natural Philosophy and Physical Geography. Princeton University awarded him an honorary doctoral degree. He also served as emeritus professor of physics at the Franklin Institute and professor of physics at the Medico-Chirurgical College. While teaching physics at Central High School in Philadelphia, he helped design an arc light generator with his former student colleague Elihu Thomson. Together, they created the Thomson- Houston Electric Company in 1882 which soon after moved to Lynn, Massachusetts. Elihu Thomson Papers at the American Philosophical Society He served as chief electrician of Philadelphia's International Electrical Exhibition in 1884. In 1892, Thomson-Houston merged with the Edison General Electric Company to form General Electric, with management from Thomson- Houston largely running the new company. In 1894, Houston formed a consulting firm in electrical engineering with Arthur Kennelly. He and Kennelly had also jointly published a series called \\"Primers of Electricity\\" in 1884.

When current flows, the layer of material emits radiation in the form of visible light. Electroluminescence (EL) is an optical and electrical phenomenon where a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field. The term \\"electroluminescent display\\" describes displays that use neither LED nor OLED devices, that instead use traditional electroluminescent materials. Beneq is the only manufacturer of TFEL (Thin Film Electroluminescent Display) and TAESL displays. The structure of a TFEL is similar to that of a passive matrix LCD or OLED display, and TAESL displays are essentially transparent TEFL displays with transparent electrodes. TAESL displays can have a transparency of 80%. Both TEFL and TAESL displays use chip-on-glass technology, which mounts the display driver IC directly on one of the edges of the display. TAESL displays can be embedded onto glass sheets. Unlike LCDs, TFELs are much more rugged and can operate at temperatures from -60 to 105¬∞C and unlike OLEDs, TFELs can operate for 100,000 hours without considerable burn-in, only losing about 80% of its initial brightness. The electroluminescent material is deposited using atomic layer deposition, which is a process that deposits one 1-atom thick layer at a time.https://beneq.com/en/displays/products/all Mechanism EL works by exciting atoms by passing an electric current through them, causing them to emit photons. By varying the material being excited, the colour of the light emitted can be changed. The actual ELD is constructed using flat, opaque electrode strips running parallel to each other, covered by a layer of electroluminescent material, followed by another layer of electrodes, running perpendicular to the bottom layer. This top layer must be transparent in order to let light escape. At each intersection, the material lights, creating a pixel.

He was a child prodigy whose career began early as did his fame with various writers authoring works about him. He exhibited in the United States and Europe as well as major venues in Mexico such as the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Palacio de Bellas Artes. His monumental sculptures can be found in various parts of Mexico and in Europe as well. Recognitions of his work include Mexico's National Art Prize, the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres and membership in France's Legion of Honour. Life El Toro Soriano was born Juan Francisco Rodr√≠guez Montoya in Guadalajara to Rafael Rodr√≠guez Soriano and Amalia Montoya Navarro. Starting in childhood he began to call himself Juan Soriano, preferring the maternal surname of his father. He described his family of origin as ‚Äúeccentric.‚Äù He was a child prodigy, and in 1933, his sister introduced him to painter Alfonso Michel Mart√≠nez who taught him current modes of Expressionist and neo Baroque painting. He then studied under Francisco Rodr√≠guez ‚ÄúCaracalla‚Äù at the Evoluci√≥n Studio in Guadalajara, which also trained Ra√∫l Anguiano and Jes√∫s Guerrero Galv√°n. At this time he was also a regular visitor to the home and business of Jes√∫s Reyes Ferreira. Reyes gave him work in his shop to make decorated wrapping paper as he did but Soriano found the work difficult. However, the time here allowed him to meet creators such as Luis Barrag√°n and Roberto Montenegro, experience European art in books and magazines and discover portraits by Jos√© Mar√≠a Estrada, which Reyes collected. Soriano also went to his first museum and began to read classic books edited by Jos√© Vasconcelos. His first exhibition of his work allowed him to meet artists such as Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, Lola √Ålvarez Bravo and Mar√≠a Izquierdo, who encouraged him to move to Mexico City, which he did in 1935 at the age of fifteen, along with his sister Martha. Here he continued a lifelong cultivation of friendships with artists, writers and intellectuals, which Soriano stated was one of the main treasures of his life. These included Xavier Villaurrutia, Carlos Pellicer, Octavio Paz (who wrote several essays about him), Lola and Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo, Rafael Solana (with whom he traveled to UC Berkeley in 1938), Isabel Villase√±or, Frida Kahlo, Lupe Mar√≠n and Salvador Novo. He was part of a regular social circle with Octavio G. Barreda as part of his love for poetry and writing, becoming involved in magazines such as El hijo prodigo and La Revista de la Universidad de M√©xico. Soriano visited Rome for the first time in 1952 and in 1954 visited Crete where he painted Apolo y las musas. He returned to Rome again to live from 1969 to 1975, which allowed him to study classical art. In 1963 he suffered an automobile accident which he documented in a painting called El accidente. In 1974, Soriano met Polish dancer Marek Keller on a visit to Paris, introduced by writer Sergio Pitol. This was the beginning of an over thirty-year relationship. Soriano worked incessantly and cared only about his work, leaving the rest of his affairs in disorder. Keller stepped in to manage most of these and put some order in the artist's life. The two remained together, living in both Mexico City and Paris until Soriano's death. Since then, Keller has worked to promote the artist's legacy in various parts of the world. Juan Soriano died in 2006 at the age of 85 at the Instituto Nacional de Nutrici√≥n Salvador Zubir√°n in Mexico City from multiple causes. Career Jalisco artist sculpture Juan Soriano sculpture Soriano began his career early in life and fame came early as well. Soriano's work was first exhibited at the Guadalajara Museum, which led to his move to Mexico City in 1935. From 1936 to 1937 he studied at the Escuela Noctura de Arte para Obreros under Emilio Caero and Santos Balmori. Balmori helped him to be accepted into the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (LEAR) and a small exhibition at the end of this course at the Palacio de Bellas Artes brought him to the attention of In√©s Amor. However, he did not stay with LEAR for long, leaving in 1938 because he did not like its politics. His first individual exhibition was in 1936 at the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City. This was followed by another at the Galer√≠a de Arte of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico . During the rest of the 1940s, he exhibited in various venues in New York and Philadelphia and at the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano. In the 1950s the exhibited at the Schneider Gallery in Rome, the first of many individual shows in Europe, along with exhibitions in venues in Mexico such as the Antonio Souza Gallery, the Rutherford Gallery in San Francisco and his first retrospective and tribute at the Museo de Arte Moderno and Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1959. In the 1960s he had an important show at the Palacio de Bellas Artes (1966) as well as an exhibit of a series of portraits her created with only Lupe Mar√≠n as model at the Misrachi Gallery. In the 1970s, he received a grant from the Fundaci√≥n Cultural Televisa to create thirty largescale works and thirty small ones which were then exhibited at the Museo de Arte Moderno. In 1993, he had an exhibit of sculpture at the Colegio de Jalisco and the Instituto Cultural de M√©xico in San Antonio. His last major exhibits before his death included the Centro Cultural Espa√±ol de Cooperaci√≥n Iberoamericana in Miami (2001), the Real Casa de Correos in Madrid (2002), the Meadows Museum and Southern Methodist University (2002), the Instituto Italo-Latino Americano in Rome (2003) and multiple exhibitions at the Instituto Mora in Mexico City (2005). During his career, Soriano created a number of monumental sculptures which can be found in Mexico and Europe. These include El Toro at the Tom√°s Garrido Canabal Park in Villahermosa (1987), La Paloma at the MARCO Museum in Monterrey (1989), La Ola for the World Trade Center in Guadalajara (1989), El Caracol for the Amparo Museum in Puebla (1989), La Luna for the National Auditorium in Mexico City (1993), La Sirena for Plaza Loreto in Mexico City (1994), Dafne for the Arcos-Bosques Building (1995), Mano for the Herdez Group headquarters (1995), two sculptures for the Expo Hannover 2000 in Germany, six monumental sculptures for different parts of Mexico in 2003 and several of his works can be found in a park in Warsaw. Soriano dedicated much of his career from the 1930s to 1960s to the theater, starting as a child working with puppetry. Much of this work was with a group he created with Jaime Garc√≠a Terr√©s, Leonora Carrington and others called Poes√≠s en Voz Alta, noted by Carlos Monsiv√°is as a ‚Äúliberating movement of the theater‚Äù in Mexico. Most of this work was in set and costume design, such as for the Teatro del Sindicato de Electricistas, Teatro Orientaci√≥n (with Celestino Gorostiza), El Caballito Theater and Teatro Sullivan. In the 1940s he wrote and produced a ballet with Diego de Mesa called El p√°jaro y las doncellas, based on a painting by Carlos M√©rida, with music by Carlos Jim√©nez Mabarak. Soriano began teaching art soon after his arrival to Mexico City, starting with the Escuela Primaria de Arte with the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. From 1939 to 1941 he gave classes in nude drawing at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\", teaching students such as Tom√°s Parra. From 1961 to 1962 he taught ceramics at the Escuela De Dise√±o y Artesanias of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. His affinity for poetry and association with many writers led to collaboration as an illustrator on a number of projects. In 1953 he illustrated the book Homenaje a Sor Juana edited by Juan Jos√© Arreola in the collection ‚ÄúLos Presentes.‚Äù In 1967 he illustrated El Bestiario by Guillaume Apollinaire. In the 1979 he illustrated the cover of Octavio Paz's book Xavier Villarrutia en persona y en obra. In 1980 he created a collection of thirty two prints with text by Sergio Piton called El √∫nico argumento. In 1989 he began illustration for the book Antol√≥gico Animal√≠a by Alfonso Reyes. In 2003 he illustrated La Fuerza del Destino by Julieta Campos and El Aguila o Sol by Octavio Paz. The artist has received numerous awards and other recognitions for his art and career during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1950 he received the first prize at the Sal√≥n de Invierno, and in 1957 he received the Jos√© Clemente Orozco Award from the government of Jalisco. In 1963 the Casa del Lago Juan Jos√© Arreola in Mexico City held a tribute and retrospective of his theater work. In 1976, he received an award from the VII International Painting Festival in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France. In 1984 he received the Gold Medal from the Instituto Cultural Caba√±as . In 1985, for his 50th year of artistic production, the Instituto Cultural Caba√±as and the Palacio de Bellas Artes held retrospectives. In 1987 he received the Premio Nacional de Arte, France named him as a member of the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres and he received the Jalisco Art Prize. In 1990 a tribute was held for him at the National Museum of Mexican Art, and from 1995-1996 a retrospective of his graphic work toured the United States. In 1997 the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid held a retrospective. In 1998 Elena Poniatowska published ‚ÄúJuan Soriano, ni√±o de mil a√±os.‚Äù In 1999 the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana held a retrospective and in 2000, a collection of his monumental sculptures were placed on display at the Z√≥calo in Mexico City for his 80th birthday In 2001, Arturo Ripstein filmed a biography of Soriano called ‚ÄúFecit- Dixit.‚Äù In 2004, he was made an officer in France's Legion of Honour, and in 2005 he received the Premio de Excelencia Universal, the Premio Vel√°zquez de Artes Pl√°sticas from the government of Spain, a gold medal from the Palacio de Bellas Artes and an honorary doctorate from the Universidad de Colima. His last award while alive was the Order of Merit from the Polish government. Since then, his work has been remembered in events such as a retrospective at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana in 2012 and a tribute sponsored by CONACULTA in 2013. In 2004, shortly before his death, he founded with his partner the Fundaci√≥n Juan Soriano and Marek Keller. Other institutions have been named after the artist such as the Galer√≠a Juan Soriano of Centro Nacional de las Artes and in 2012, the Juan Soriano Sculpting Prize was established. Artistry Classified as part of the second wave of the Mexican muralism movement, Soriano's work include painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic works, illustrations, tapestries and set and costume design for works such as those by Eug√®ne Ionesco, Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, Francisco de Quevedo, Juan Ib√°√±ez and others. His work was highly prized by various writers including Octavio Paz, Carlos Pellicer and Elena Ponatowska, with art critic Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n quoted as saying he was ‚Äúa poet, profound painter of visual parables.‚Äù Soriano did not believe that art should be political or solemn and Jes√∫s Reyes Ferreira was an early influence on his work. His painting style did change almost abruptly in the mid 1950s, marked by works such as La Carrera de bicicletas, Apolo y las muas and Peces luminosos, along with a portrait of Mar√≠a Zambrano, showing probably influence from painter Roberto Matta. In the 1960s, he experimented briefly with abstract painting. He was a noted portrait painter with a style that Teresa del Conde called ‚Äúalways legible and at the same time strangely problematic.‚Äù Much of his very early work was portraits either by choice or by commission and similar to that of Julio Castellanos and Federico Cant√∫. One notable series of portraits were those of model and novelist Lupe Mar√≠n in the 1960s. Soriano stated that he did not believe that painting was an exact reflection of time or the artists, but rather a ‚Äúform of intuition that goes beyond conscious life.‚Äù From 1951 to 1953 he was in Rome where he worked on ceramics with Chileans Piero and Andrea Cacella and in the 1960s began to create works in bronze as well. His graphic work is less known but he began creating them in 1944 and continued until 2001. In 1975, he received a commission to do graphic work at the Bramsen et Colt workshop in Paris, which caused him to divide his time between Paris and Mexico City. One notable series are interpretations of works by Juan Rulfo. In 2003, he worked on tapestry design with a death theme for the Gobelinos Workshop in Guadalajara. Juan Soriano Museum The Museo Morelense de Arte Contempor√°neo (MMAC) Juan Soriano opened on June 8, 2018, in Cuernavaca, Morelos.https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/museo-juan-soriano-el-nuevo- recinto-de-arte-en-cuernavaca accessed Dec 23, 2018. The MMAC is a project by JSa Arquitectura led by the architect Javier S√°nchez Corral. Its location links Amatitl√°n, an emblematic town of Cuernavaca whose origins date back 1500 years, to the Historic Center of Cuernavaca, enriching the urban experience. It is the largest exhibition space in the state of Morelos, distributed in two galleries for temporary exhibitions: Central Gallery and Cube, in addition to an Open Forum, a multidisciplinary space. The museum includes a library, a sculptural garden, and workshops for public programs. The museum covers and was built at a cost of MXN $300 million ().http://www.milenio.com/cultura/abre-museo-arte-juan-soriano-cuernavaca accessed Dec 23, 2018.https://www.arquine.com/museo-morelense-de-arte- contemporaneo-juan-soriano/ accessed Dec 23, 2018 It houses 1,200 works by Soriano, including sculptures, paintings, drawing, and photographs. The museum has not been without controversy. Before it opened, a group called Coordinadora Morelense de Movimientos Ciudadanos (Morelense Coordinator of Citizen Movements) sued, claiming the projected cost of $195,000,000 pesos had increased to $300 million pesos. Also, they complained because the museum is designed to highlight the work of an artist from the western part of the country while ignoring local artists.https://www.zonacentronoticias.com/2018/03/presentara-la-coordinadora- morelense-denuncia-por-presunto-desvio-en-construccion-del-museo-juan-soriano/ accessed Dec 23, 2018https://www.pressreader.com/mexico/la- jornada/20180321/282149291849770 accessed Dec 23, 2018 Then after the museum opened, members of the local artistic community complained that the new governor's choice of curator for the museum was based on politics (she had been the local animal control officer) rather than on qualifications.https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/arteseideas/Inician-campana- por-Museo-Juan-Soriano-20181104-0049.html accessed Dec 23, 2018.

It was first proposed by Donald Davidson in his 1970 paper \\"Mental Events\\". The theory is twofold and states that mental events are identical with physical events, and that the mental is anomalous, i.e. under their mental descriptions, relationships between these mental events are not describable by strict physical laws. Hence, Davidson proposes an identity theory of mind without the reductive bridge laws associated with the type-identity theory. Since the publication of his paper, Davidson has refined his thesis and both critics and supporters of anomalous monism have come up with their own characterizations of the thesis, many of which appear to differ from Davidson's. Overview token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds (as indicated by the arrows) to a physical token of a single physical type. Hence there is type-identity. For anomalous monism, the token- token correspondences can fall outside of the type-type correspondences. The result is token identity. Considering views about the relation between the mental and the physical as distinguished first by whether or not mental entities are identical with physical entities, and second by whether or not there are strict psychophysical laws, we arrive at a fourfold classification: (1) nomological monism, which says there are strict correlating laws, and that the correlated entities are identical (this is usually called type physicalism); (2) nomological dualism, which holds that there are strict correlating laws, but that the correlated entities are not identical (parallelism, property dualism and pre-established harmony); (3) anomalous dualism, which holds there are no laws correlating the mental and the physical, that the substances are ontologically distinct, but nevertheless there is interaction between them (i.e. Cartesian dualism); and (4) anomalous monism, which allows only one class of entities, but denies the possibility of definitional and nomological reduction. Davidson put forth his theory of anomalous monism as a possible solution to the mind‚Äìbody problem. Since (in this theory) every mental event is some physical event or other, the idea is that someone's thinking at a certain time, for example, that snow is white, is a certain pattern of neural firing in their brain at that time, an event which can be characterized as both a thinking that snow is white (a type of mental event) and a pattern of neural firing (a type of physical event). There is just one event that can be characterized both in mental terms and in physical terms. If mental events are physical events, they can at least in principle be explained and predicted, like all physical events, on the basis of laws of physical science. However, according to anomalous monism, events cannot be so explained or predicted as described in mental terms (such as \\"thinking\\", \\"desiring\\" etc.), but only as described in physical terms: this is the distinctive feature of the thesis as a brand of physical monism. Davidson's classic argument for AM Davidson makes an argument for his version of non- reductive physicalism. The argument relies on the following three principles: :#The principle of causal interaction: there exist both mental-to-physical as well as physical-to-mental causal interactions. :#The principle of the nomological character of causality: all events are causally related through strict laws. :#The principle of the anomalism of the mental: there are no psycho-physical laws which relate the mental and the physical as just that, mental and physical. Causal interaction The first principle follows from Davidson's view of the ontology of events and the nature of the relationship of mental events (specifically propositional attitudes) with physical actions. Davidson subscribes to an ontology of events where events (as opposed to objects or states of affairs) are the fundamental, irreducible entities of the mental and physical universe. His original position, as expressed in Actions and Events, was that event-individuation must be done on the basis of causal powers. He later abandoned this view in favour of the individuation of events on the basis of spatio-temporal localization, but his principle of causal interaction seems to imply some sort of, at least, implicit commitment to causal individuation. According to this view, all events are caused by and cause other events and this is the chief, defining characteristic of what an event is. Another relevant aspect of Davidson's ontology of events for anomalous monism is that an event has an indefinite number of properties or aspects. An event such as \\"the turning on of the light-switch\\" is not fully described in the words of that particular phrase. Rather, \\"the turning on of the light-switch\\" also involves \\"the illumination of the room\\", \\"the alerting of the burglar in the kitchen\\", etc... Since a physical event, such as the action of turning on the light-switch can be associated with a very large variety of mental events (reasons) which are potentially capable of rationalizing the action a posteriori, how is it possible to choose the real cause of my turning on the light-switch (which event is the causal one)? Davidson says that the causal event, in such a case, is the particular reason that caused the action to occur. It was because I wanted to see better that I turned on the light-switch and not because I wanted to alert the burglar in the kitchen. The latter is just a sort of side effect. So, for Davidson, \\"reasons are causes\\" and this explains the causal efficacy of the mental. Nomological character of causality The principle of the nomological character of causality (or cause-law principle) requires that events be covered by so-called strict laws. Davidson originally assumed the validity of this principle but, in more recent years, he felt the need to provide a logical justification for it. So what is a strict law? =Strict laws= Whenever a particular event E1 is causally related to a second particular event E2, there must be, according to Davidson, a law such that (C1 & D1) -> D2, where C1 represents a set of preliminary conditions, D1 is a description of E1 which is sufficient, given C1, for an occurrence of an event of the kind D2, which represents the description of E2. The cause-law principle was intended by Davidson to take in both laws of temporal succession as well as bridge laws. Since Davidson denies that any such laws can involve psychological predicates (including such laws as \\"(M1 & M2) -> M3\\" wherein the predicates are all psychological or mixed laws such as ((M1 & M2 -> P1) and ((P1 & P2 -> M1))), it follows that such bridge laws as \\"P1 -> M1\\", \\"M1 -> P1\\" or \\"M1 if and only if P1\\" are to be excluded. However, mental predicates may be allowed in what are called \\"hedged laws\\" which are just strict laws qualified by ceteris paribus (all other things being equal) clauses. What this means is that while the generalization ((M1 & M2 -> P1) is justifiable ceteris paribus, it cannot be fully elaborated in terms of, e.g., (P2 & P3 & M1 & M2 & M3) -> P1. =Justification of cause-law= Davidson defended the cause-law principle by revising Curt John Ducasse's (1926) attempt to define singular causal relations without appealing to covering laws. Ducasse's account of cause was based on the notion of change. Some particular event C is the cause of some effect E if and only if C was the only change that occurred in the immediate environment of E just prior to the occurrence of E. So, for example, the striking of a match is the cause of the flaming of the match to the extent that the striking is the only change that occurs in the immediate vicinity of the match. Davidson turns this around and asks if it is not the case that our notions of change do not, rather, appeal to a foundation of laws. Davidson first observes that 'change' is just shorthand for 'change of predicate', in that a change occurs when and only when a predicate that is true (false) of some object later becomes false (true) of that object. Second, and more importantly, the notion of change has itself changed over time: under Newtonian physics, continuous motion counts as change but not in Aristotelian physics. Hence, it could be argued that what we view as change is theory- dependent and presupposes a background notion of laws. Since change is fundamental to the concept of cause and change is dependent on laws, it follows that cause is also dependent on laws. The anomalism of the mental The third principle requires a different justification. It suggests that the mental cannot be linked up with the physical in a chain of psycho-physical laws such that mental events can be predicted and explained on the basis of such laws. This principle arises out of two further doctrines which Davidson espoused throughout his life: the normativity of the mental and semantic holism. =Normativity= Propositional attitude ascriptions are subject to the constraints of rationality and, so, in ascribing one belief to an individual, I must also ascribe to him all of the beliefs which are logical consequences of that ascription. All of this is in accordance with the principle of charity, according to which we must \\"try for a theory that finds him consistent, a believer of truths, and a lover of the good\\" (Davidson 1970). But we can never have all the possible evidence for the ascription of mental states for they are subject to the indeterminacy of translation and there is an enormous amount of subjectivity involved in the process. On the other hand, physical processes are deterministic and descriptive rather than normative. Therefore, their base of evidence is closed and law-governed. =Holism= Vincenzo Fano provides an illustration of the point that holism of the mental generates anomalism. Fano asks us to first consider the attribution of length to a table. To do this, we must assume a set of laws concerning the interaction between the table and the measuring apparatus: the length of the table doesn't vary significantly during the measurement, length must be an additive quantity, \\"longer than\\" must be an asymmetric, transitive relation and so forth. By assuming these laws and carrying out a few operations, we reach the result of the measurement. There is a certain amount of holism in this process. For example, during the measurement process, we might discover that the table is much hotter than the measuring device, in which case the length of the latter will have been modified by the contact. Consequently, we need to modify the temperature of the measuring device. In some cases, we will even have to reconsider and revise some of our laws. This process can continue for some time until we are fairly confident of the results obtained. But it is not only necessary to have a theory of the interactions between the table and the measuring device, it is also necessary to attribute a set of predicates to the table: a certain temperature, rigidity, electric charge, etc... And the attribution of each of these predicates presupposes, in turn, another theory. So, the attribution of F to x presupposes Px and the theory T_f , but Px, in turn, presupposes P'x and T_p and so on. As a result, we have a series of predicates F, P, P' , P ... and a series of theories T_f , T_p , T_p' .... As Fano states it, \\"this process would seem like a regressus ad infinitum, if it weren't that T_f + T_p + T_p' + T_p converges toward a theory T which is nothing other than physics in its entirety.\\" The same is true of the predicates, which converge toward the set of all the possible physical quantities. Fano calls this 'convergent holism'. He asks us to then consider the attribution of a belief. We are seeking a good scientific theory of amorous relations. We ask ourselves if Thomas, who has recently been betrayed by his girlfriend Ffion, believes that it is possible that the relationship can continue. The way we can find out the answer to this question is simply by asking Thomas if he believes it is possible. Thomas says no. Does this authorize us to attribute to Thomas the belief that the relationship cannot continue? Of course not, since Thomas is probably angry and confuses his desire to break up with Ffion with his beliefs. So we ask him if he is angry with Ffion. He says that he is, but we cannot attribute to him the belief that the relationship can continue, because we don't really know if he's confusing his desires with his beliefs or vice versa. So now we ask Thomas if he will still retain the same opinion next month. Thomas pauses for a while and then says yes. At this point, we think we have a definitive confirmation of the fact that Thomas believes that the relation must be interrupted, since he reflected on the matter before answering. Just to be sure, we ask him what came to mind during that interval of reflection. Thomas answers that he thought of all the unhappy incidents between that took place between him and Ffion. So we return to our original hypothesis on the basis that Thomas is angry and therefore confuses his desires and his beliefs. How can all this be formalized? At the beginning, we attributed the predicate \\"no\\" to Thomas as a direct response to our question. This is a physical predicate F. We can call the attribution of Thomas' belief that the relationship cannot continue m. From Fx, we cannot deduce mx. On the basis of the hypothesis that a person who is angry is not capable of examining their own opinions clearly, we asked Thomas if he was angry. We ascribed to him the mental predicate m1 and the physical predicate F1 (the answer \\"yes\\" to the question whether he is angry). Now, we can deduce m1 (the fact that he is angry) from F1. But from m1 and F1, we can deduce neither m (the fact that Thomas believes the relationship cannot continue) nor not m. So we continue by attributing the next physical predicate F2 (the positive answer to our question whether he will be of the same opinion in one month). From F2, F1 and m1, we would like to deduce not m. But we weren't sure what Thomas was thinking about during his pause, so we asked him to tell us and, on the basis of this response F3, we deduce m2 (that Thomas confuses his desires with his beliefs). And so on ad infinitum. The conclusion is that the holism of the mental is non-convergent and therefore it is anomalous with respect to the physical. Resolving the contradiction So how are the three seemingly irreconcilable principles above resolved? Davidson distinguishes causal relations, which are an extensional matter and not influenced by the way they are described, from law-like relations, which are intensional and dependent on the manner of description. There is no law of nature under which events fall when they are described according to the order in which they appeared on the television news. When the earthquake caused the Church of Santa Maria dalla Chiesa to collapse, there is surely some physical law(s) which explains what happened, but not under the description in terms of the event on Channel 7 at six p.m. causing the events on Channel 8 at six fifteen. In the same way, mental and physical events are causally related but not qua mental events. The mental events have explanatory predicates which are physical as well as predicates which are irreducibly mental. Hence, AM is a form of predicate dualism which accompanies ontological monism. Finally, for those who objected that this is not really a form of physicalism because there is no assurance that every mental event will have a physical base, Davidson formulated the thesis of supervenience. Mental properties are dependent on physical properties and there can be no change in higher-level properties without a corresponding change in lower-level properties. Arguments against AM and replies Ted Honderich has challenged the thesis of anomalous monism, forcing, in his words, the \\"inventor of anomalous monism to think again\\". To understand Honderich's argument, it is helpful to describe the example he uses to illustrate the thesis of AM itself: the event of two pears being put on a scale causes the event of the scale's moving to the two-pound mark. But if we describe the event as \\"the two French and green things caused the scale to move to the two-pound mark\\", then while this is true, there is no lawlike relation between the greenness and Frenchness of the pears and the pointers moving to the two-pound mark. Honderich then points out that what we are really doing when we say that there is \\"no lawlike relationship between two things under certain descriptions\\" is taking certain properties and noting that the two things are not in relation in virtue of those particular properties. But this does not mean they are not in lawlike relation in virtue of certain other properties, such as weight in the pears example. On this basis, we can formulate the generalization that Honderich calls 'the Nomological Character of Causally-Relevant Properties'. Then we ask what the causally relevant properties of the mental events which cause physical events are. Since Davidson believes that mental events are causally efficacious (i.e. he rejects epiphenomenalism), then it must be a mental event as such (mental properties of mental events) which are the causally relevant properties. But if we accept the first two claims of the argument for AM, along with the idea of the causal efficacy of the mental, and the Principle of Causally-Relevant properties, then the result is a denial of anomalous monism because there are indeed psycho-physical lawlike connections. On the other hand, if we wish to retain the principle of the anomalism of the mental then we must reject causal efficacy and embrace epiphenomenalism. Davidson has responded to such arguments by reformulating anomalous monism and has defended the improved version in Thinking Causes. He points out that the defect in the so-called epiphenominalism problem lies in its confusion of the concept \\"by virtue of\\" (or necessary for) with the idea of an event's being responsible for another. Also, Honderich's example of the pears and the scale is jerry rigged in such a way that only a single effect is taken into consideration: the alteration on the scale. But the action of placing pears on a scale can have many different effects; it can attract the attention of a customer, for example. In this case, the causally relevant properties would be precisely the color, shape and other irrelevant properties of the fruit. What is relevant or irrelevant therefore depends, in part, on the context of explanatory interest. See also * Biological naturalism * Neutral monism Sources References *Davidson, D.

History Originally called Dove, the group released its debut single, \\"Fallen\\", on the Glasgow-based label Soma in October 1991. It was a significant club hit and brought them a deal with the Junior Boy's Own label. Changing their name to avoid confusion with a similarly named group, in 1992 JBO issued a new recording of \\"Fallen\\", produced by Andrew Weatherall, which brought the group to greater attention from the British music press. The single was withdrawn one week after release however, due to an unlicensed sampling of a harmonica from a Supertramp song. Further critical acclaim followed with the release of the 12\\" single \\"Transient Truth\\". At this stage, One Dove were still primarily a club- oriented group, but for the single \\"White Love\\", an attempt was made to make their music more radio-friendly by including a commercial remix by Stephen Hague. With this increasingly commercial sound, the band became a favourite with publications such as Select and Q, and were often favourably compared with Saint Etienne, another female-fronted group who were having success with pop-dance crossover recordings. In 1993, One Dove released their only album, Morning Dove White, which included the Weatherall version of \\"Fallen\\" (minus the Supertramp sample) together with 12\\" mixes of \\"Transient Truth\\" and \\"White Love\\". The album was originally set for release in 1992 but was delayed for a full year through disputes between the band and their new record company - London Records had taken over the Boy's Own label. The band were unhappy about the commercialisation of their sound, and the disputes were only resolved when the band agreed to release singles mixed by Stephen Hague, if they could work with him in the studio during the remix sessions. The album was preceded by the single \\"Breakdown\\", with remixes by Stephen Hague, William Orbit and Secret Knowledge and a further track from the album, \\"Why Don't You Take Me,\\" was subsequently released as a single for the Christmas market. For the B-sides of the \\"Why Don't You Take Me\\" single (which included a reworking of Dolly Parton's song \\"Jolene\\"), the group expanded to a five-piece with the addition of Ed Higgins on percussion and Colin McIlroy on guitar, and showcased a more heavily dub-influenced sound. This line-up later went into the studio to begin work on a second album, but frustrated by record industry politics, split up midway through the sessions.

The first vehicles were a 6 to 9 passenger window van version of the Corvair 95 van. The Corvair 95 series also included the Loadside pickup truck and Rampside pickup truck that featured a mid-body ramp on the right side. All used the Corvair powertrain in a truck body and were produced between model years 1961 to 1965. The Greenbrier name was used a second time from 1969 until 1972; for the mid-level Chevelle station wagon. 1961‚Äì1965 Corvair Greenbrier Sportswagon Chevrolet introduced the Corvair lineup for the 1960 model year as the first of a series of generations of passenger compact cars. Chevrolet introduced a more utilitarian style of vehicle the following year under the model designation \\"Corvair 95\\". In appearance and design the vehicles were similar to the competing Volkswagen Transporter, which was essentially a bus- like adaptation of the Volkswagen Beetle that moved the driver over the front wheels (Forward control), also commonly defined as a cab over vehicle. The air-cooled horizontally opposed Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine was located in the rear of the vehicle under a slightly raised cargo floor. It was similar in principle to the 4-cylinder engine of the Volkswagen, but unusual for most contemporary cars. The engine developed at 4,400 rpm. Engine size was increased to for the 1964 model year, raising output to . Unlike the Corvair cars, the Corvair Greenbrier had a wheelbase and were thus known as \\"95s.\\" They came standard with a three-speed manual transmission but could be ordered with a two-speed Corvair Powerglide automatic transmission (distinct from the usual Powerglide); eventually a four-speed manual was also made available. Greenbrier (US) 1962 Rampside Pickup - rear engine placement under loadbed 1962 Chevrolet Corvair Greenbrier There were essentially two different bodies available in the 95 series: the van and the truck. The base version was the panel van (Corvan) with no side or rear windows. The van was named Greenbrier. The Greenbrier normally had windows all around and six doors, although an option was to have eight doors where there were opening double doors on both sides. The Greenbrier seated up to nine people with the available third-row seat. The 95s and cars had an optional heater using gasoline from the vehicle's tank. The Greenbrier also had a camper option. A Corvair truck could be ordered as a \\"Loadside\\" or \\"Rampside\\". The Loadside was essentially a pickup truck with a standard tailgate. The Loadside was only produced two years and is the rarest of the Corvairs; production totaled 2,844 in 1961 and 369 in 1962. The Rampside had a side ramp to be used for loading and unloading cargo. These were used by the Bell Telephone Company because loading and unloading of cable drums was eased by the side ramp. Ford and Chrysler introduced compact vans of their own (the Ford Econoline and Dodge A100), using a more conventional water-cooled engine mounted between the front seats. As these became successful, General Motors responded with its own design which placed the Chevy II sourced engine in a \\"doghouse\\" between and behind the front seats. The forward engine design allowed a flat rear floor with low deck heights in the rear of the van for loading/unloading cargo. General Motors stopped producing the truck versions of the Corvair in 1964 and the Greenbrier was the only remaining wheelbase Corvair for 1965. Eventually, Chevrolet and Volkswagen would abandon rear-engined vans in favor of conventional or front- wheel-drive water-cooled engines. Although the Greenbriers were a limited success, passenger vans would continue to evolve through full-sized vans. The similarly sized 7‚Äì8 passenger would become a successful vehicle segment by the 1980s as alternatives to station wagons. 1969‚Äì1972 Chevelle Greenbrier During the 1969 model year, the four-door station wagons of the mid-sized Chevrolet Chevelle, produced since 1964, were renamed: the standard-trim station wagon known as the Chevelle 300 was renamed as the Nomad, while the medium-trim Chevelle 300 Deluxe was now called the Greenbrier. The top-of-the- line model, the Chevelle Malibu 135/136, became the Concours and Concours Estate Wagon, the latter being distinguished by exterior woodgrain paneling. Except for the simplest Nomad line (which was only available in a six-seater form), all station wagons could be ordered with either six or nine seats. Standard engine was the inline-six (not available for nine-seaters). For 1970, the Chevelle 300 Deluxe series was simply called Chevelle and the inline-six engine was no longer available in the station wagons. In 1972 the series' model code was changed to 1C. The Nomad, Greenbrier, and Concours names were all dropped for 1973 when the Chevelle was redesigned and the wagons all began sharing series names with other body styles.

Professional interests and activities A popular lecturer in the Jungian world, Beebe has spoken on topics related to the theory and practical applications of analytical psychology to professional and lay audiences throughout the United States and around the world. He has been especially active in introducing training in Jungian psychology in China. Beebe is the Founding Editor of The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal, now called Jung Journal: Culture & Psyche. He was the first American co-editor of the London-based Journal of Analytical Psychology. Beebe has also published in The Chiron Clinical Series, Fort Da, Harvest, The Inner Edge, Journal of Jungian Theory and Practice, Psychoanalytic Psychology, Psychological Perspectives, The Psychoanalytic Review, Quadrant, Spring, The Journal of Popular Film and Television, Theory and Psychology, and Tikkun, among others. He has contributed book chapters to The Anne Rice Reader, The Cambridge Companion to Jung, From Tradition to Innovation, House, Humanizing Evil, Initiation, Jungian Perspectives on Clinical Supervision, New Approaches to Dream Interpretation, Post-Jungians Today, Psyche & City, The Psychology of Mature Spirituality, Same-Sex Love, The Soul of Popular Culture, and Teaching Jung. With Donald Sandner, Beebe is the author of ‚ÄúPsychopathology and Analysis‚Äù,\\"Psychopathology and Analysis\\", book chapter, originally written with senior co-author Donald Sandner, for Murray Stein, (ed.), Jungian Analysis (Open Court: La Salle, Illinois, 1982) an article on Jungian complex theory used in many training programs, and with Thomas Kirsch and Joe Cambray the author of ‚ÄúWhat Freudians Can Learn from Jung‚Äù. He is the author of the book Integrity in Depth, a study of the archetype of integrity, and of Energies and Patterns in Psychological Type: The Reservoir of Consciousness. An avid film buff, Beebe frequently draws upon American movies to illustrate how the various types of consciousness and unconsciousness interact to produce images of Self and shadow in the stories of our lives that Jung called individuation. His reviews and articles about movies have reached a wide audience. With Virginia Apperson, he is co-author of The Presence of the Feminine in Film. He can be seen discussing film in the documentary The Wisdom of the Dream. Among his better-known papers are ‚ÄúAttitudes Toward the Unconscious‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Father‚Äôs Anima as a Clinical and as a Symbolic Problem‚Äù, ‚ÄúOn Male Partnership‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrimary Ambivalence Toward the Self: Its Nature and Treatment‚Äù, ‚ÄúToward a Jungian Analysis of Character‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Trickster in the Arts‚Äù. Eight-function model Beebe is particularly interested in the way an understanding of typology can foster the development of the capacity to take responsibility for our impact on others. Following up on Jung's theory of psychological types, where the contrasting attitudes of extraversion and introversion colored the judging (rational) functions of thinking and feeling, and the perceiving (irrational) functions of intuition and sensation, he developed an archetypal model of a dialogical self wherein conscious functions contend with more unconscious complexes in the shadow. A person's dominant (most preferred) function is the ‚Äúhero‚Äù (or \\"heroine\\"), which is most closely allied with a semi-conscious complex called the ‚Äúanima‚Äù (or \\"animus\\"). The hero is also challenged by an ‚Äúopposing personality‚Äù. The next most preferred, or auxiliary, function is the good parent, which may be counteracted by a shadowy witch/senex complex; similarly the tertiary function (‚Äúchild‚Äù) may be undermined by a more juvenile ‚Äútrickster‚Äù. Finally, the anima may find itself forced to compete with a demonic personality function which threatens to destroy it. A discussion and explanation of this model can be found in C. G.

It was enthusiastically received by the Russian society and remained his least controversial and most widely read novel until the end of the 19th century. It was turned into a movie by Andrey Konchalovsky in 1969.  Plot summary  The novel's protagonist is Fyodor Ivanych Lavretsky, a nobleman who shares many traits with Turgenev. The child of a distant, Anglophile father and a serf mother who dies when he is very young, Lavretsky is brought up at his family's country estate home by a severe maiden aunt, often thought to be based on Turgenev's own mother, who was known for her cruelty. Lavretsky pursues an education in Moscow, and while he is studying there, he spies a beautiful young woman at the opera. Her name is Varvara Pavlovna, and he falls in love with her and asks for her hand in marriage. Following their wedding, the two move to Paris, where Varvara Pavlovna becomes a very popular salon hostess and begins an affair with one of her frequent visitors. Lavretsky learns of the affair only when he discovers a note written to her by her lover. Shocked by her betrayal, he severs all contact with her and returns to his family estate. Upon returning to Russia, Lavretsky visits his cousin, Marya Dmitrievna Kalitina, who lives with her two daughters, Liza and Lenochka. Lavretsky is immediately drawn to Liza, whose serious nature and religious devotion stand in contrast to the coquettish Varvara Pavlovna's social consciousness. Lavretsky realizes that he is falling in love with Liza, and when he reads in a foreign journal that Varvara Pavlovna has died, he confesses his love to her and learns that she loves him in return. After they confess their love to one another, Lavretsky returns home to find his supposedly dead wife waiting for him in his foyer. It turns out that the reports of her death were false, and that she has fallen out of favor with her friends and needs more money from Lavretsky. Upon learning of Varvara Pavlovna's sudden appearance, Liza decides to join a remote convent and lives out the rest of her days as a nun. Lavretsky visits her at the convent one time and catches a glimpse of her as she is walking from choir to choir. The novel ends with an epilogue which takes place eight years later, in which Lavretsky returns to Liza's house and finds that, although many things have changed, there are elements such as the piano and the garden that are the same. Lavretsky finds comfort in his memories and is able to see the meaning and even the beauty in his personal pain.  Major themes  Ultimately, Turgenev concludes that the truth is best left unstated. He concludes the novel by stating that he could not possibly explain what Lavretsky and Liza felt, and that it is better to point out these individual tragedies and pass them by. Turgenev wrote the novel shortly after his 40th birthday, and it expresses some of his feelings about middle age, as its protagonist is forced to confront the mistakes of his past and determine what options are left for his dwindling future.  Literary significance and criticism  The novel is often recognized for its musical elements and the quiet lull of its prose.

It is closely related to, and was formerly often considered conspecific with, the little tern of the Old World. Other close relatives include the yellow-billed tern and Peruvian tern, both from South America. It is a small tern, long, with a wingspan of , and weighing . The upper parts are a fairly uniform pale gray, and the underparts white. The head is white, with a black cap and line through the eye to the base of the bill, and a small white forehead patch above the bill; in winter, the white forehead is more extensive, with a smaller and less sharply defined black cap. The bill is yellow with a small black tip in summer, all blackish in winter. The legs are yellowish. The wings are mostly pale gray, but with conspicuous black markings on their outermost primaries. It flies over water with fast, jerky wingbeats and a distinctive hunchback appearance, with the bill pointing slightly downward. It is migratory, wintering in Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. Many spend their whole first year in their wintering area. It has occurred as a vagrant to Europe, with one record in Great Britain. It differs from the little tern mainly in that its rump and tail are gray, not white, and it has a different, more squeaking call; from the yellow-billed tern in being paler gray above and having a black tip to the bill; and from the Peruvian tern in being paler gray above and white (not pale gray) below and having a shorter black tip to the bill. Subspecies The differences among the three subspecies may not be as much as had been thought. Parent feeding a small chick in Florida, USA * S. a. athalassos ‚Äì (Burleigh & Lowery, 1942): Breeds on the rivers of the Arkansas River, Mississippi River, Brazos River, Trinity River, and Rio Grande basins; winters south to northern Brazil. * S. a. antillarum ‚Äì (Lesson, 1847): nominate, Breeds on the Atlantic coast of North America, from Maine south along the east and south coasts of the United States, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and Venezuela; winters south to northern Brazil. * S. a. browni ‚Äì (Mearns, 1916): California least tern. Breeds on the Pacific coast of North America, from central California south to western Mexico; winters mainly in Central America. * An unknown subspecies was found in 2012 nesting on the Big Island of Hawaii Conservation and status =S. a. antillarum= The population is about 21,500 pairs; it is not currently considered federally threatened, though it is considered threatened in many of the states in which it breeds. Threats include egg and fledgling predators, high tides and recreational use of nesting beaches. =S. a. athalassos= The interior subspecies, with a current population of about 7000 pairs, was listed as an endangered subspecies in 1985 (estimated 1000 breeding pairs), due to loss of habitat caused by dams, reservoirs, channelization, and other changes to river systems. =S. a. browni= The western population, the California least tern, was listed as an endangered species in 1972 with a population of about 600 pairs. With aggressive management, mainly by exclusion of humans via fencing, the Californian population has rebounded in recent years to about 4500 pairs, a marked increase from 582 pairs in 1974 when census work began, though it is still listed as an endangered subspecies. The California subspecies breeds on beaches and bays of the Pacific Ocean within a very limited range of southern California, in San Francisco Bay and in northwestern Mexico. While numbers have gradually increased with its protected status, it is still vulnerable to predators, natural disasters or further disturbance by humans. Recent threats include the gull-billed tern (Sterna nilotica), which can decrease reproductive success in a colony to less than 10%. Nesting and breeding behavior The least tern arrives at its breeding grounds in late April. The breeding colonies are not dense and may appear along either marine or estuarine shores, or on sandbar islands in large rivers, in areas free from humans or predators. Courtship typically takes place removed from the nesting colony site, usually on an exposed tidal flat or beach. Only after courtship has confirmed mate selection does nesting begin by mid-May and is usually complete by mid-June. Nests are situated on barren to sparsely vegetated places near water, normally on sandy or gravelly substrates. In the southeastern United States, many breeding sites are on white gravel rooftops. In the San Francisco Bay region, breeding typically takes place on abandoned salt flats. Where the surface is hard, this species may use an artificial indentation (such as a deep dried footprint) to form the nest basin. The nest density may be as low as several per acre, but in San Diego County, densities of 200 nests per acre have been observed. Most commonly the clutch size is two or three, but it is not rare to consist of either one or four eggs. Adults are known to wet themselves and shake off water over the eggs when arriving at the nest. Both female and male incubate the eggs for a period of about three weeks, and both parents tend the semiprecocial young. Young birds can fly at age four weeks. After formation of the new families, groupings of birds may appear at lacustrine settings in proximity to the coast. Late-season nesting may be renests or the result of late arrivals. In any case, the bulk of the population has left the breeding grounds by the end of August.

It hovers until spotting prey, and then plunges into the water without full submersion to extract meal. The most common prey recently for both chicks and adults are silversides smelt (Atherinops spp.) and anchovy (Anchoa spp.) in southern California, as well as shiner perch, and small crustaceans elsewhere. Adults in southern California eat kelpfish (most likely giant kelpfish, Heterostichus rostratus). Insects are known to be eaten during El Ni√±o events. In southern California, least terns feed in bays and lagoons, near shore, and more than from shore in the open ocean. Elsewhere, they feed in proximity to lagoons or bay mouths. Adults do not require cover, so that they commonly roost and nest on the open ground. After young chicks are three days old, they are brooded less frequently by parents and require wind blocks and shade, and protection from predators. In some colonies in southern California, Spanish roof tiles are placed in colonies so chicks can hide there. Notable disruption of colonies can occur from predation by burrowing owls, gull-billed terns and American kestrels. Depredation by domestic cats has been observed in at least one colony. Predation on inland breeding terns by coyotes, bobcats, feral dogs and cats, great blue herons, Mississippi kites, and owls has also been documented. References   Gary Deghi, C.

It is located around 29 km from Chennai Central railway station. Thirunindravur comes under Chennai Metropolitan Area. The neighbourhood is served by Thirunindravur railway station. It is famous for its temples. The Tiruninravur lake serves the neighbourhood for its water needs. History The name Thiruninravur comes from the Tamil words Thiru, nindra and vur. The Tamil word Thiru represents the name for the Hindu god Perumal. Nindra refers to stood and vur refers to a village or a place. It is said that Lakshmi was travelling through the sky and saw this beautiful village and stood here; she wondered how beautiful is this village. Thus the place came to be known as Thiru-ninra-vur, the village where Lakshmi stood. Here there are two ancient temples which are written in the history of Tamil literature. As moonlight comes on to the temple Gopura it is special for many occasions. This location is also the home town of Pusalar, the Nayanar saint. Demographics India census, Thiruninravur had a population of 1,77,095. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Thirunindravur has an average literacy rate of 91%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 95%, and female literacy is 88.6%. Famous places Thiruninravur is famous for Hridayaleeswarar Temple and Bakthavatsala Perumal Temple is one of the 108 Divyadesams. Hridayaleeswarar Temple Pusalar Nayanar constructed the temple in his heart that design is physically constructed by Mahindra Pallava 1500 years ago by the order of Lord Shiva. Both the temples were built in Pallava era. Many devotees from in and around Chennai, Thiruvallur and Kanchipuram regularly visit these temples. We can find good rush in Bakthavatsala Perumal Temple on Vaikunta Ekadasi and Hridayaleeswarar Temple during Prathosham days. Both the temples are historic, and are well maintained. Roadways The Outer Ring Road which is being laid in order to connect Vandalur to Ennore is being routed via Thiruninravur to Nemilichery and more other places. The present National Highway - NH205 passes through Thiruninravur and also referred to as MTH road or CTH road. The phase I from vandalur to nemelicherry (thirunindravur) has been completed and is available for the public. The new Outer Ring road makes commutation much faster and easier for the private vehicle drivers, avoiding many traffic, to reach Poonamalle, Tambaram, Chennai airport center much sooner than before. The Tamil Nadu Highways department issued a GO on 4 October 2013 to extending the entire Chennai - Tirutani highway to 6 lanes at a cost of 168 Cr. The first phase will involve extending the road to 4 lanes - 100 ft with center median and encroachments have already started to be removed.

Bulgarians entering Southern Dobruja in Romania per the Treaty of Craiova (1940). Bulgarian invasion of southern Yugoslavia (Macedonia, April 1941). rightThe history of Bulgaria during World War II encompasses an initial period of neutrality until 1 March 1941, a period of alliance with the Axis Powers until 8 September 1944, and a period of alignment with the Allies in the final year of the war. Bulgarian military forces occupied with German consent parts of the kingdoms of Greece and Yugoslavia which Bulgarian irredentism claimed on the basis of the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano. Bulgaria resisted Axis pressure to join the war against the Soviet Union begun on 22 June 1941, but did declare war on Britain and the United States on 13 December 1941. The Red Army entered Bulgaria on 8 September 1944; Bulgaria declared war on Germany the next day. As an ally of Nazi Germany, Bulgaria participated in the Holocaust, causing the deaths of 11,343 Jews, and though 48,000 Jews survived the war, they were subjected to forcible internal deportation, dispossession, and discrimination. Bulgaria functioned as an authoritarian state during most of World War II. Tsar Boris III (reigned 1918‚Äì1943) ruled through a parliament and a prime minister. Bulgaria's wartime government was pro-German under Georgi Kyoseivanov, Bogdan Filov, Dobri Bozhilov, and Ivan Bagryanov. It joined the Allies under Konstantin Muraviev in early September 1944, then underwent a coup d'√©tat a week later, and under Kimon Georgiev was pro-Soviet thereafter. Initial neutrality (September 1939‚Äì1 March 1941) The government of the Kingdom of Bulgaria under Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the war; but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains in order to recover the territories lost in the Second Balkan War and World War I, as well as gain other lands with a significant Bulgarian population in the neighbouring countries. Bulgaria had been the only defeated power of 1918 not to have received some territorial award by 1939. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. Turkey had a non-aggression pact with Bulgaria. This recovery of territory reinforced Bulgarian hopes for resolving other territorial problems without direct involvement in the War. Bulgaria, as a potential beneficiary from the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in August 1939, had competed with other such nations to curry favour with Nazi Germany by gestures of antisemitic legislation. Bulgaria was economically dependent on Germany, with 65% Bulgaria's trade in 1939 accounted for by Germany, and militarily bound by an arms deal. Bulgarian extreme nationalists lobbied for a return to the enlarged borders of the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano. The Bulgarian officer class were mainly pro-German while the population at large was predominantly Russophile. On 7 September 1940, after the Second Vienna Award in August, Southern Dobruja, lost to Romania under the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, was returned to Bulgarian control by the Treaty of Craiova, formulated under German pressure. A citizenship law followed on 21 November 1940, which transferred Bulgarian citizenship to the inhabitants of the annexed territory, including to around 500 Jews, alongside the territory's Roma, Greeks, Turks, and Romanians.Zakon za ure≈ædane na podanstvoto v Dobrud≈æa, D.V., n¬∞ 263, 21.11.1940. Bulgaria had earlier briefly re-acquired Southern Dobruja between 1916 and 1918. In October 1940 the Law for the Protection of the Nation was introduced to parliament. The bill made legislative progress through the winter of late 1940, with parliament reviewing it on the 15, 19, and 20 November. The week before the debates over the bill continued to second reading on 20 December 1940, a ship carrying 326 Bulgarian Jewish and other Jewish refugees heading to British- administered Palestine, the Salvador, was wrecked in the Sea of Marmara on 14 December with 230 lives lost. Of the 160 seats in the National Assembly, a majority of between 115 and 121 members voted with the government. The parliament ratified the bill on Christmas Eve, 1940. It received royal assent from Tsar Boris III on 15 January the following year, being published in the State Gazette on 23 January 1941.DƒÉr≈æaven vestnik [State gazette], D.V., 16, 23.01.1941. The law forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews as defined by the Law.DƒÉr≈æaven vestnik [State gazette], D.V., 16, 23.01.1941. The Law's second chapter ordered measures for the definition, identification, segregation, and economic and social marginalization of Jews. The law had been proposed to parliament by Petar Gabrovski, Interior Minister and former Ratnik leader in October 1940. His prot√©g√©, government lawyer and fellow Ratnik, Alexander Belev, had been sent to study the 1933 Nuremberg Laws in Germany and was closely involved in its drafting. Modelled on this precedent, the law targeted Jews, together with Freemasonry and other intentional organizations deemed \\"threatening\\" to Bulgarian national security. The Law introduced restrictions on foreign Jews as well. In late 1938 and early 1939 Bulgarian police officials and the Interior Ministry were already increasingly opposed to the admittance of Jewish refugees from persecution in Central Europe.CDA, F 370K, o 6, ae 928, l 75 r/v.CDA F 176K, o 11, ae 1775, l.10 In response to a query by British diplomats in Sofia, the Foreign Ministry confirmed the policy that from April 1939, Jews from Germany, Romania, Poland, Italy, and what remained of Czechoslovakia (and later Hungary) would be required to obtain consent from the ministry to secure entry, transit, or passage visas.CDA F 176K, o 11, ae 1775, l.10CDA F 176K, o 11, ae 1775, l.9 Nevertheless, at least 430 visas (and probably around 1,000) were issued by Bulgarian diplomats to foreign Jews, of which there were as many as 4,000 in Bulgaria in 1941.Search in State Agency \\"Archives\\" (6984 documents in Bulgarian) On 1 April 1941 the Police Directorate allowed the departure of 302 Jewish refugees, mostly underage, from Central Europe for the express purpose of Bulgaria \\"freeing itself from the foreign element\\".CDA, F 176 K, o 11, ae 2165, l. 10-25.CDA, F 176K, o 11, ae 1779, l. 10. After April 1941, the Law's jurisdiction was extended beyond Bulgaria's pre-war borders to territories in Greece and Yugoslavia occupied by the Bulgarian army and claimed and administered by Bulgaria. Bulgaria had been mooted as a possible member of the Soviet sphere in the Molotov-Ribbentrop discussions in November 1939; the significance of Bulgaria's position increased after the British Empire intervened in the Balkans campaign and Hitler's plans to invade the Soviet Union progressed. Pressure built on Boris to join the Axis, but he vacillated, and the government committed to joining - but at an unspecified date. In the planning of Operation Marita, the Germans sought to cross Bulgaria to invade Greece. Bogdan Filov travelled to Vienna to sign the Tripartite Pact at the beginning of March.  Axis Powers (1 March 1941‚Äì8 September 1944)  After the failure of the Italian invasion of Greece, Nazi Germany demanded that Bulgaria join the Tripartite Pact and permit German forces to pass through Bulgaria to attack Greece in order to help Italy. The Bulgarian prime minister signed the pact on the 1 March 1941; German forces crossed the Danube into Bulgaria the same day. The threat of a possible German invasion, as well as the promise of Greek and Yugoslavian territories, led the tsar and his government to sign the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. With the Soviet Union in a non-aggression pact with Germany, there was little popular opposition to the decision, and it was recognized with applause in the Parliament a couple of days later. = Occupation in Thrace and Macedonia = On 6 April 1941, despite having joined the Axis Powers, the Bulgarian military did not participate in the invasion of Yugoslavia and the invasion of Greece, but were ready to occupy their pre- arranged territorial gains immediately after the capitulation of each country.Jozo Tomasevich, War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941 - 1945, Volume 2, Stanford University Press, 2002, , p. 196.Featherstone, K., et al., The Last Ottomans: The Muslim Minority of Greece 1940-1949, Springer, 2011, , p. 83. The Yugoslav government surrendered on 17 April; on 19 April, the Bulgarian Land Forces entered Yugoslavia. The Greek government surrendered on 30 April; the Bulgarian occupation began the same day. Bulgaria's contribution to Operation Marita and the Axis conquest of Greece was relatively minor; the Bulgarians and a Wehrmacht division guarded the left flank of the invasion. After Greece and Yugoslavia's capitulation, three Bulgarian divisions from the Second and Fifth Armies deployed to Thrace and Macedonia to relieve pressure on the Germans. In words chosen by Tsar Boris, Bulgaria announced the occupation of Macedonia and Thrace \\"to preserve order and stability in the territories taken over by Germany\\". Bulgarians, elated by the de facto unification of lost national irredenta, named Boris \\"King Unifier\\". Bulgaria occupied most of Yugoslav Macedonia, Pomoravlje, Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, which had already been captured by the forces of the Germans and their allies and which had been lost to Bulgaria in 1918. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma River and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the Maritsa river. Included in the area occupied were the cities of Alexandroupoli (), Komotini (), Serres (), Xanthi (), Drama () and Kavala () and the islands of Thasos and Samothrace in Greece, as well as almost all of what is today the Republic of North Macedonia and much of South-Eastern Serbia, then in Yugoslavia. In the region of Macedonia, the majority initially welcomed union with Bulgaria as relief from Yugoslavian Serbianization, while pro-Bulgarian sentiments there still prevailed.In Macedonia, eyewitnesses recall and newsreel footage shows that the local Macedonian population went out to greet the Bulgarian troops who had helped remove the Yugoslav yoke, and that they waved Bulgarian flags.

Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2002, , p. 67. After 1918, more than 1,700 Bulgarian churches and monasteries had been converted to Serbian or Greek Orthodoxy, and some 1,450 Bulgarian schools closed. Bulgarian had been forbidden in public life. Bulgarization was seen as necessary to strengthen Bulgaria's claim on the territory after a projected Axis victory, since Germany had not definitively indicated Bulgaria would keep it and no international treaty recognized Bulgaria's claims; \\"the Bulgarian nature of the territories had to be incontrovertible by the end of the war\\". Consequently, a university - Macedonia's first - bearing Boris III's name was instituted in Skopje, more than 800 new schools were built between 1941 and 1944, Macedonian schools were integrated into Bulgaria's education system, and Macedonian teachers were retrained in Bulgarian. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church sought the integration of Bulgarian-ruled Macedonia with the Exarchate of Bulgaria. It was hoped the \\"national reunification\\" might lead to a restored Bulgarian Patriarchate representative of all Bulgarian communities, but Tsar Boris, wary of any new power-base in his kingdom, opposed the plan. At Easter in Skopje Cathedral the service was officiated by a Bulgarian cleric. Priests were encouraged out of retirement to preach in Macedonian parishes. The government in Sofia preferred to appoint Bulgarian bishops loyal to the Exarchate to sees in Macedonia than local candidates, a policy which disappointed Macedonians and Bulgarians alike. By 1944, Sofia's government was as unpopular in Macedonia as Belgrade's had been before the occupation, each government alienating Macedonians with over-centralization. In Thrace, more opposition was met with. Before June 1941 and the German‚ÄìTurkish Treaty of Friendship, the Germans did not allow Bulgarian civilian administration for fear of antagonizing Turkey with Bulgarian expansion; separate Greek, German, and Bulgarian occupation zones prevailed until August 1941. Thereafter, pressure was applied to Turkish inhabitants of the region to emigrate. The demographics of western Thrace had been changed by the 1921 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, with the arrival of many Greeks from East Thrace in the Turkish Republic and the departure of many Turks. Most villages were assigned to the Nevrokop diocese of the Bulgarian Church as part of a wider Bulgarization policy in education and religion. The Bulgarian school system was introduced in September 1941 and by 1942's end there were 200 new primary schools and 34 gymnasia established for ethnic Bulgarians alone; Turks and Greeks had separate schools, and despite protests of Muslim teachers, children of Pomaks were sent to Bulgarian schools organized on Orthodox Christian lines. Also in September 1941, the suppression of the Drama uprising against Bulgarian rule on the night of the 28-'9 September resulted in the deaths of around 1,600 people. The Bulgarian government hoped in Thrace to remove ethnic Greeks who had arrived in territory ceded to Greece after 1918, at which time Bulgarians had been the demographic plurality. Bulgarization was encouraged by a new law on internal migration and consolidation in June 1941, by a new land directorate to facilitate Bulgarian settlers set up in February 1942 with plots of land distributed to officials, and by incentives for ethnic Bulgarians from southern Macedonia to move to replace departing Greeks in Thrace. There was also a bias towards Bulgarians in the cooperative bank established to assist farmers there. By March 1942, resettlement permits issued to Bulgarians in Thrace numbered 18,925. After 1942, Allied victories and Greek and Turkish threats of reprisals caused a decrease in the rates of Bulgarians emigrating to Thrace. Because food was brought in from metropolitan Bulgaria, Bulgarian-occupied western Thrace was spared the famine that affected German and Italian occupation zones in Greece, even though Thrace was less developed than either Bulgaria or the rest of Greece. Although Bulgarian citizenship had been granted jus soli to residents of newly annexed South Dobruja, the Law for the Protection of the Nation forbade to granting of citizenship to Jews in the subsequently occupied territories, and no action was taken to determine the status of any of the inhabitants at all until 1942. Jews were merely issued with identity cards in a different colour to non- Jews'. A decree-law issued on 10 June 1942 (Nerada za podantstvo v osvobodenite prez 1941 godina zemi) confirmed that the \\"liberated\\" territories' Jewish residents were ineligible for Bulgarian citizenship.CDA, F 242K, o 4, ae 897, l.8-10 This effectively made them stateless. = International situation = Damage in Sofia from the Anglo-American bombings in 1944.Bulgaria did not join the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941 nor did it declare war on the Soviet Union. Bulgarian propaganda refrained from criticism of Stalin. Tsar Boris's position was that the Bulgarian army was not equipped properly or modernised sufficiently to face the Red Army, with conscript soldiers who would not fight effectively far from home against Bulgaria's former Russian allies. Moreover, Bulgaria's military was positioned to thwart any potential threat to the Axis from Turkey or an Allied landing in Greece. Boris resisted German pressure to allow Bulgarian soldiers or volunteers join the fight against the Soviets. Involvement by the navy was limited to escorting Axis convoys in the Black Sea. However, despite the lack of official declarations of war by both sides, the Bulgarian Navy was involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, which attacked Bulgarian shipping. Besides this, Bulgarian armed forces garrisoned in the Balkans battled various anti-Axis resistance groups and partisan movements. On 5 March 1941, after the start of Operation Marita, Britain severed diplomatic relations with Bulgaria but war was not declared by either side. To show support for the Axis, the Bulgarian government declared a token war on the United Kingdom and the United States on 13 December 1941, an act which resulted in the bombing of Sofia and other Bulgarian cities by Allied aircraft from 1941. The Bulgarian military was able to destroy some Allied aircraft passing through Bulgarian airspace to attack Romania's oilfields. The first were on the return flight of Operation Tidal Wave air raid on Ploie»ôti on 1 August 1943, part of the oil campaign; bombers flying back to airbases in North Africa over Bulgaria were intercepted by fighters of the Bulgarian Air Force and aircrew that reached the ground alive were interned as prisoners of war under the 1929 Geneva Convention. Most POWs were from the United States Army Air Forces and the Royal Air Force, with American, British, Canadian, Australian, Dutch, Greek, and Yugoslav airmen were all interned at a prisoner-of-war camp opened on 25 November 1943 under the control of the Bulgarian Army's garrison at Shumen and commended by an officer of lieutenant rank. Downed aircrew were usually captured and imprisoned locally, interrogated in the prison in Sofia, and then moved to the POW camp at Shumen; one American airman was liberated from a local jail by the communist partisans, with whom he thereafter evaded capture. Allied POWs were ultimately interned at Shumen for ten months. The few Soviet POWs were interned at a camp at Sveti Kiri, together with over a hundred Soviet citizens resident in Bulgaria, under the authority of the State Security section of the Police Directorate (DPODS). The German invasion of the Soviet Union caused the activation of a guerrilla movement headed by the underground Bulgarian Communist Party which was cracked-down on severely by the government. A resistance movement called Fatherland Front was set up in August 1942 by the Communist Party, the Zveno movement, and a number of other parties to oppose the then pro-Nazi government, after a number of Allied victories indicated that the Axis might lose the War. Partisan detachments were particularly active in the mountain areas of western and southern Bulgaria. Two weeks after a visit to Germany in August 1943, Bulgarian Tsar Boris III died suddenly on 28 August aged 49. There was speculation that he was poisoned - a recent meeting with Hitler had not been cordial - but no culprit was found. A motive for an assassination is difficult to establish: it would have been a great risk for Germans, Soviets, and British; it was uncertain who might replace Boris at the centre of the Bulgarian state. A post-mortem in the 1990s established an infarction in the left side of the heart was the direct cause of death. According to the diary of the German attache in Sofia at the time, Colonel von Schoenebeck, the two German doctors who attended the tsar ‚Äì Sajitz and Hans Eppinger ‚Äì both believed that the tsar had died from the same poison that Dr Eppinger had allegedly found two years earlier in the postmortem examination of the Greek prime minister Ioannis Metaxas.Wily Fox: How King Boris Saved the Jews of Bulgaria from the Clutches of His Axis Ally Adolf Hitler, AuthorHouse 2008, 213, His six-year-old son Simeon II succeeded to the throne; a council of regents was set up because of Simeon's age. The new Prime Minister from 14 September 1943, Dobri Bozhilov, was in most respects as pro-German as his predecessor Bogdan Filov, who was appointed to the regency council. Boris had begun to seek Bulgaria's escape from war, and the regency, which lacked his authority abroad and at home, made similar designs. Bozhilov intensified negotiations with the western Allies, fearing the fate of Benito Mussolini's government. On 19 November 1943 the first heavy bombing of Bulgarian cities by the Allies took place. After further raids and an even heavier assault on Sofia on 30 March 1944, many of Sofia's inhabitants fled the city. Major Frank Thompson of the Special Operations Executive was parachuted in to rendezvous with the Bulgarian Resistance, but was captured and executed for espionage in June 1944. After April 1944, the Soviets increased pressure on Bulgaria to abandon the Axis alliance. Bulgaria had maintained diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union while being a member of the Axis Powers. In the summer of 1944, after crushing the Nazi defences around Ia»ôi and Chi»ôinƒÉu, the Soviet Army was approaching the Balkans and Bulgaria. On 1 June 1944 Filov sacked Bozhilov in the hope of placating internal opposition and placating the Allies - Filov had reluctantly decided the alliance with Germany should end. Ivan Bagryanov took over as prime minister. Filov sought delay, hoping that an Allied landing in the Balkans would allow Bulgaria to join the Allies without the loss of the new territories in Thrace and Macedonia while avoiding the German occupation of Bulgaria that would follow an immediate change in sides. The western Allies' invasion of Normandy began that week however, ending the possibility of a major western Allied offensive in the Balkans, while the Soviet westward offensives continued apace. Meanwhile German forces were being withdrawn from Greece and Bulgaria had lost its strategic significance to the western Allies. Bagryanov had sympathies for the West and hoped to disengage Bulgaria from the war before the Red Army reached the Danube and avoid a communist occupation, but his plans went awry after King Michael's Coup in late August. By the middle of August, American diplomatic pressure and a report of the International Committee of the Red Cross which had detailed hardships of the inmates had caused conditions at the POW camp at Shumen to be improved; before this, the Allied POWs were allowed only limited water and suffered from malnutrition. Bagryanov repealed the antisemitic legislation of his predecessors on 17 August. On 23 August 1944, Romania left the Axis Powers, declared war on Germany, and allowed Soviet forces to cross its territory to reach Bulgaria. Bagryanov had had success in negotiating the withdrawal of the German forces from Varna on the grounds that their presence invited an Allied attack and blocked the arrival of any more German troops in Bulgaria. On 27 August, the Bulgarian government announced neutrality; Bagryanov handed over to the Germans 8,000 railway wagons to accelerate their withdrawal. The Fatherland Front, which had demanded full neutrality, decried this assistance. On the same date the Fatherland Front made the decision to incite an armed rebellion against the government. By September the Soviet pressure to declare war on Germany was intense. Bagryanov assured the Soviets foreign troops in Bulgaria would be disarmed, ordered German troops to leave the country, and began to disarm German soldiers arriving in Dobruja, but refused to violate Bulgaria's own newly-declared neutrality by declaring war on Germany. On 30 August Joseph Stalin declared he would no longer recognize Bulgarian neutrality. On 2 September Bagryanov resigned and his government fell, to be replaced by a government led by Konstantin Muraviev and made up of those opposition parties which were not members of the Fatherland Front. Muraviev initially opposed war with Germany, arguing this would be used as pretext for a Soviet occupation of Bulgaria. Support for the government was withheld by the Fatherland Front, accusing it of being composed of pro-Nazi circles attempting to hold on to power. On 4 September the Fatherland Front organized popular strikes. On 5 September, Muraviev decided to break off diplomatic relations with Germany but delayed announcing the move for two days at the urging of the War Minister Lieut. Gen. Ivan Marinov to enable Bulgarian troops to withdraw from occupied Macedonia. When all German troops had left the country on the afternoon of 7 September, Bulgaria declared war on Germany but earlier on the same day the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria, without consultation with either the USA or Britain, \\"to liberate Bulgaria\\". On 8 September Bulgaria was simultaneously at war with four major belligerents of the war: Germany, Britain, the USA and the USSR. The Soviets crossed the border on the 8 September. The Red Army occupied the north-eastern part of Bulgaria along with the key port cities of Varna and Burgas by the next day. The Bulgarian Army did not offer resistance by an order of the government.R. J.

During Bulgaria's alliance with Nazi Germany, the Bulgarian government introduced Nazi-style measures and legislation targeting Jews and other minorities; in September 1939 all Jews regarded as foreign nationals - some 4,000 - were expelled. Most fled eventually to Palestine, arriving there after considerable difficulty. Interior Minister Petar Gabrovski, and Alexander Belev, having studied the Nuremberg Laws, introduced in 1940 the Law for Protection of the Nation, in force from January 1941. By this means, Jews under Bulgaria's control were excluded from most professions, universities, and trades unions, from all government service, and from certain public areas. Moreover, Jews were required to carry special identity cards, were forbidden to bear \\"non-Jewish\\" names or marry Bulgarians. The Bulgarian irredentist seizure in 1941 of coveted territory from Greece and Yugoslavia and the formation of the new oblasts of Skopje, Bitola, and Belomora increased Bulgaria's Jewish population to around 60,000. These were forbidden to have Bulgarian citizenship under the Law for the Protection of the Nation. From early in the war, Bulgarian occupation authorities in Greece and Yugoslavia handed over Jewish refugees fleeing from Axis Europe to the Gestapo. In October 1941 Bulgarian authorities demanded the registration of 213 Serbian Jews detected by the Gestapo in Bulgarian-administered Skopje; they were arrested on 24 November and 47 of these were taken to Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade, Serbia and killed on 3 December 1941.Centralen DƒÉr≈æaven Arhiv [Central State Archives], CDA, F 2123 K, o 1, ae 22 286, l. 56-57. The Law for the Protection of the Nation was followed by a decree-law (naredbi) on 26 August 1942, which tightened restrictions on Jews, widened the definition of Jewishness, and increased the burdens of proof required to prove non-Jewish status and exemptions (privilegii). Jews were thereafter required to wear yellow stars, excepting only those baptized who practised the Christian eucharist. Bulgarian Jews married to non-Jews by Christian rite before 1 September 1940 and baptized before the 23 January 1941 enforcement of the Law for the Protection of the Nation, rescinding the exemptions allowed to such cases allowed by the Law. Exemptions for war orphans, war widows, and the disabled veterans were henceforth applicable only \\"in the event of competition with other Jews\\", and all such privilegii could be revoked or denied if the individual were convicted of a crime or deemed \\"anti-government\\" or \\"communist\\". In February 1943 SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Theodor Dannecker and Belev - appointed by Gabrovski in 1942 to head the new \\"Office of the Commissar of Jewish Affairs\\" within the interior ministry - signed the Dannecker-Belev Agreement, in which Bulgaria agreed to supply Germany with 20,000 Jewish captives. Bulgaria is the only nation to have signed an agreement with Germany to supply Jews in this way; Bulgaria agreed to meet the cost of their expulsion and the document explicitly noted that Bulgaria, knowing their fate in German hands, would never request the Jews' repatriation. The Law for the Protection of the Nation stipulated that Jews fulfil their compulsory military service in the labour battalions and not the regular army. Forced labour battalions were instituted in Bulgaria in 1920 as a way of circumventing the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, which limited the size of the Bulgarian military and ended conscription into the regular military. The forced labour service (trudova povinnost) set up by the government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski supplied cheap labour for government projects and employment for demobilised soldiers from the First World War. In the first decade of its existence, more than 150,000 Bulgarian subjects, \\"primarily minorities (particularly Muslims) and other poor segments of society\\" had been drafted to serve. In the 1930s, in the lead-up to the Second World War, the trudova povinnost were militarised: attached to the War Ministry in 1934, they were given military ranks in 1936. After the start of war, in 1940 \\"labour soldiers\\" (trudovi vojski) were established as a separate corps \\"used to enforce anti-Jewish policies during World War Two\\" as part of an overall \\"deprivation\\" plan. In August 1941, at the request of Adolf-Heinz Beckerle - German Minister Plenipotentiary at Sofia - the War Ministry relinquished control of all Jewish forced labour to the Ministry of Buildings, Roads, and Public Works.Ruling n¬∞ 113, Council of Ministers, protocol 132, 12.08.1941. Mandatory conscription applied from August 1941: initially men 20-44 were drafted, with the age limit rising to 45 in July 1942 and 50 a year later. Bulgarians replaced Jews in the commands of the Jewish labour units, which were no longer entitled to uniforms. On 29 January 1942, new all-Jewish forced labour battalions were announced; their number was doubled to twenty-four by the end of 1942. Jewish units were separated from the other ethnicities - three quarters of the forced labour battalions were from minorities: Turks, Russians, and residents of the territories occupied by Bulgaria - the rest were drawn from the Bulgarian unemployed.DƒÉr≈æaven Voenno-Istoriƒçeski Arhiv [State Military-Historical Archives] DVIA, F 2000, o 1, ae 57, l.57‚Äì74. The Jews in forced labour were faced with discriminatory policies which became stricter as time went on; with increasing length of service and decreasing the allowance of food, rest, and days off. On 14 July 1942 a disciplinary unit was established to impose new punitive strictures: deprivation of mattresses or hot food, a \\"bread-and-water diet\\", and the barring of visitors for months at time.Ruling n¬∞ 125, Council of Ministers, protocol 94, 14.07.1942. As the war progressed, and round-ups of Jews began in 1943, Jews made more numerous efforts to escape and punishments became increasingly harsh.Records of the 7th Chamber of the People‚Äôs Court, March 1945 - CDA, F 1449, o 1, ae 181. In March 1943 Bulgarian troops and military police rounded up the Jews in Bulgarian-occupied Greek Macedonia and Vardar Macedonia in Yugoslavia - 7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace - and sent them to via transit concentration camps to the Bulgarian Danube port of Lom, where they were embarked and taken upriver to Vienna and thence to Treblinka; nearly all were killed. This was arranged by request of the German foreign ministry in spring 1942 to surrender all Jews under Bulgarian control to German custody, to which the Bulgarian government acceded, creating the \\"Jewish Affairs\\" commissariat under Belev to organize the genocide called for at the Wannsee Conference. By March 1943 Jewish Bulgarians were being concentrated at schools and train stations by the Bulgarian authorities within the country's pre-war borders. Subsequently, in spring 1943, protests led by parliamentarian Dimitar Peshev M.P. and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, concerned over the welfare of Jewish converts to Christianity as well as of a \\"national minority\\" generally, succeeded in first delaying, and then in May in finally preventing Belev's plan to meet the 20,000 figure by deporting some 8,000 Bulgarian Jews from Sofia, Kyustendil, and elsewhere to Nazi extermination camps in Poland, including all southwest Bulgaria's Jews; they were instead dispossessed of all their property, deported to the provinces, and the men aged 20‚Äì40 conscripted into forced labour, as were Jews from Stara Zagora and Kazanlak. On 21 May 1943 the Council of Ministers voted that Jews were to be expelled from Sofia to the countryside in three days' time. Belev ordered the expulsion on 24 May of Jews from the capital: 19,000 Sofia Jews were deported to specific rural areas and towns. Special trains were arranged and the Jews were assigned specific departures, separating family members. A maximum of 30kg of property per person was allowed;Ruling n¬∞ 70, Council of Ministers, protocol 74, 21.05.1943. the rest they were forced leave behind, to sell at \\"abusively low\\" prices, or which was otherwise pilfered or stolen. Bulgarian officials and neighbours benefited from the proceeds. In April 1943 Joachim von Ribbentrop enquired of King Boris why more Jews had not been sent for extermination by Bulgaria; the response came that Boris would deport ‚Äúonly a small number of Bolshevik‚Äêcommunist elements from Old Bulgaria [Bulgaria's pre-1941 borders] because he needed the rest of the Jews for road construction.‚Äù In May 1943, Bulgaria imprisoned prominent Jewish leaders in Somivit concentration camp and late that month and the following month more than 20,000 Jews were deported from Sofia and their property seized. (In 1934, Sofia had had around 25,000 Jewish inhabitants, close to a tenth of the city's total population.) The German foreign ministry understood that Bulgaria feared the Allies and hoped to avoid antagonizing them. Nonetheless, the Nazi-style ghettoization and curfew of Bulgaria's Jewish population was completed in 1943 and antisemitic racial laws were not repealed until 30 August 1944. Allies (September 1944‚Äì May 1945) On 8 September, Soviet forces crossed the Bulgarian-Romanian border and on the eve of 8 September garrison detachments, led by Zveno officers, overthrew the government after taking strategic points in Sofia and arresting government ministers. A new government of the Fatherland Front was appointed on 9 September with Kimon Georgiev as prime minister. War was declared on Germany and its allies at once and the weak divisions sent by the Axis Powers to invade Bulgaria were easily driven back. A pro-Axis Bulgarian government-in-exile was formed in Vienna, under Aleksandar Tsankov and while it was able to muster a 600-strong Bulgarian SS regiment of Bulgarian anti-communist volunteers already in Germany under a German commander, they had little success. Soviet POWs and interned Soviet citizens were released from Sveti Kirik DPODS detention camp when the Fatherland Front took power. Allied POWs were released to the western Allies and repatriated by way of Turkey, and the POW camp at Shumen closed on 25 September 1944. The concentration camp for Bulgarian communists and Soviet- sympathisers at Stavroupoli () in Greece was closed as the Bulgarians withdrew from occupied territory. An armistice with the Allies was signed on the 28 October 1944 in Moscow. Signatories were George F. Kennan, Andrey Vyshinsky, and Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr represented by Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin and Lieut. Gen James Gammell for the Allies and the United Nations Organization, and for the Bulgarians the Foreign Minister Petko Stainov, Finance Minister Petko Stoyanov, and Nikola Petkov and Dobri Terpeshev as ministers without portfolio.Department of State Bulletin, October 29 1944, Vol. XI, ‚Ññ 279 Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1944. In Macedonia, the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces, and betrayed by high-ranking military commanders, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. Unlike the Communist resistance, the right wing followers of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) saw the solution of the Macedonian Question in creating a pro-Bulgarian Independent Macedonian State. At this time the IMRO leader Ivan Mihailov arrived in German reoccupied Skopje, where the Germans hoped that he could form a Macedonian state on the base of former IMRO structures and Ohrana. Seeing that Germany had lost the war and to avoid further bloodshed, after two days he refused and set off.Hitler's new disorder: the Second World War in Yugoslavia, Stevan K. Pavlowitch, Columbia University Press, 2008, , pp. 238-240. Under the leadership of a new Bulgarian pro-Communist government, three Bulgarian armies (some 455,000 strong in total) entered Yugoslavia in September 1944 and alongside Soviet and Yugoslav forces, moved to Ni≈° and Skopje with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Southern and eastern Serbia and Macedonia were liberated within a month and the 130,000-strong Bulgarian First Army continued to Hungary, driving off the Germans and entering Austria in April 1945. Contact was established with the British Eighth Army in the town of Klagenfurt on 8 May 1945, the day the Nazi government in Germany capitulated. Then Gen. Vladimir Stoychev signed a demarcation agreement with British V Corps commander Charles Keightley. Consequences and results First Bulgarian Army on the 17th of June in 1945 after its return from Austria at the end of hostilities in Europe. As a consequence of World War II, the Soviet Union invaded Bulgaria and a Communist regime was installed with Georgi Dimitrov at the helm. The monarchy was abolished in 1946 and the tsar sent into exile. The People's Republic of Bulgaria was established, lasting until 1990. The Red Army remained in occupation of Bulgaria until 1947. Bulgaria later joined the Warsaw Pact in 1954 and 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Though the Bulgarian armistice with the Soviet Union had surrendered all territory occupied and claimed by Bulgaria in Greek and Yugoslavian Macedonia and Thrace, the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 confirmed the incorporation of Southern Dobruja into Bulgaria during the War, thus making Bulgaria the only Axis country that increased its pre-war territory. The occupied parts of the Aegean region and Vardar Macedonia remaining within the borders of Bulgaria were returned, with 150,000 Bulgarians being expelled from Western Thrace. Subsequent to their ordeal during the war, most of Bulgaria's remaining Jews - some 50,000 in September 1944 - emigrated. About 35,000 left for Palestine during the British Mandate and the great majority of the remainder departed to the post-1948 State of Israel; by the first years of the 1950s some 45,000 Bulgarian Jews had left the post-war communist state. Armed forces By the end of the war, Bulgaria managed to mobilize about 450,000 men. Military equipment was mostly of German origin. By 1945, Bulgaria had also received stocks of Soviet weaponry, mostly small arms.

Plot summary =Part one= Sue Trinder, an orphan raised in \\"a Fagin-like den of thieves\\" by her adoptive mother, Mrs Sucksby, is sent to help Richard \\"Gentleman\\" Rivers seduce a wealthy heiress. Posing as a maid, Sue is to gain the trust of the lady, Maud Lilly, and eventually persuade her to elope with Gentleman. Once they are married, Gentleman plans to commit Maud to a madhouse and claim her fortune for himself. Sue travels to Briar, Maud's secluded home in the country, where she lives a sheltered life under the care of her uncle, Christopher Lilly. Like Sue, Maud was orphaned at birth; her mother died in a mental asylum, and she has never known her father. Her uncle uses her as a secretary to assist him as he supposedly compiles a dictionary, and keeps her to the house, working with him in the silence of his library. Sue and Maud forge an unlikely friendship, which develops into a mutual physical attraction. After a time, Sue realises she has fallen in love with Maud, and begins to regret her involvement in Gentleman's plot. Deeply distressed, but feeling she has no choice, Sue persuades Maud to marry Gentleman, and the trio flee from Briar to a nearby church, where Maud and Gentleman are hastily married in a midnight ceremony. Making a temporary home in a local cottage, and telling Maud they are simply waiting for their affairs to be brought to order in London, Gentleman and a reluctant Sue make arrangements for Maud to be committed to an asylum for the insane. Her health has already waned as a result of the shock of leaving her quiet life at Briar, to Gentleman's delight. After a week, he and Sue escort an oblivious Maud to the asylum in a closed carriage. However, the doctors apprehend Sue on arrival, and from the cold reactions of Gentleman and the seemingly innocent Maud, Sue guesses that it is she who has been conned. =Part two= In the second part of the novel, Maud takes over the narrative. She describes her early life being raised by the nurses in the mental asylum where her mother died, and the sudden appearance of her uncle, who arrives when she is eleven to take her to Briar to be his secretary. Her induction into his rigid way of life is brutal; Maud is made to wear gloves constantly to preserve the surfaces of the books she is working on, and is denied food when she tires of labouring with her uncle in his library. Distressed, and missing her previous home, Maud begins to demonstrate sadistic tendencies, biting and kicking her maid, Agnes, and her abusive carer, Mrs Stiles. She harbours a deep resentment toward her mother for abandoning her, and starts holding her mother's locket every night, and whispering to it how much she hates her. Shockingly, Maud reveals that her uncle's work is not to compile a dictionary, but to assemble a bibliography of literary pornography, for the reference of future generations. In his own words, Christopher Lilly is a 'curator of poisons.' He introduces Maud to the keeping of the books‚Äîindexing them and such‚Äîwhen she is barely twelve, and deadens her reactions to the shocking material. As she grows older, Maud reads the material aloud for the appreciation of her uncle's colleagues. On one occasion, when asked by one of them how she can stand to curate such things, Maud answers, \\"I was bred to the task, as servants are.\\" She has resigned herself to a life serving her uncle's obscure ambition when Richard Rivers arrives at Briar. Although a heroin addict, he reveals to her a plan to help her escape her exile in Briar, a plan involving the deception of a commonplace girl who will believe she has been sent to Briar to trick Maud out of her inheritance. After initial hesitation, Maud agrees to the plan and receives her new maid, Sue, weeks later, pretending to know nothing about the plot. Maud falls in love with Sue over time and, like Sue, begins to question whether she will be able to carry out Gentleman's plot. Though overcome with guilt, Maud does, and travels with Gentleman to London after committing Sue to the asylum, claiming to the doctors that Sue was the mad Mrs Maud Rivers who believed she was her own maid. Instead of taking Maud to a house in Chelsea, as he had promised, Gentleman takes her to Mrs Sucksby in the Borough. It was, it turns out, Gentleman's plan to bring her here all along; and, Mrs Sucksby, who had orchestrated the entire plan, reveals to a stunned Maud that Marianne Lilly had come to Lant Street seventeen years earlier, pregnant and alone. When Marianne discovered her cruel father and brother had found her, she begged Mrs Sucksby to take her newborn child and give her one of her 'farmed' infants to take its place. Sue, it turns out, was Marianne Lilly's true daughter, and Maud one of the many orphaned infants who had been placed on Mrs Sucksby's care after being abandoned. Marianne revises her will on the night of the switch, entitling each of the two girls to half of Marianne Lilly's fortune. By having Sue committed, Mrs Sucksby could intercept one share; by keeping Maud a prisoner, she could take the other half. She had planned the switch of the two girls for seventeen years, and enlisted the help of Gentleman to bring Maud to her in the weeks before Sue's eighteenth birthday, when she would become legally entitled to the money. By setting Sue up as the 'mad Mrs Rivers', Gentleman could, by law, claim her fortune for himself. Alone and friendless, Maud has no choice but to remain a prisoner at Lant Street. She makes one attempt to escape to the home of one of her uncle's friends, Mr Hawtrey, but he turns her away, appalled at the scandal that she has fallen into, and eager to preserve his own reputation. Maud returns to Lant Street and finally submits to the care of Mrs Sucksby. It is then that Mrs Sucksby reveals to her that Maud was not an orphan that she took into her care, as she and Gentleman had told her, but Mrs Sucksby's own daughter. =Part three= The novel resumes Sue's narrative, picking up where Maud and Gentleman had left her in the mental asylum. Sue is devastated at Maud's betrayal and furious that Gentleman double-crossed her. When she screams to the asylum doctors that she is not Mrs Rivers but her maid Susan, they ignore her, as Gentleman (helped by Maud) has convinced them that this is precisely her delusion, and that she is really Maud Lilly Rivers, his troubled wife. Sue is treated appallingly by the nurses in the asylum, being subjected to beatings and taunts on a regular basis. Such is her maltreatment and loneliness that, after a time, she begins to fear that she truly has gone mad. She is sustained by the belief that Mrs Sucksby will find and rescue her. Sue dwells on Maud's betrayal, the devastation of which quickly turns to anger. Sue's chance at freedom comes when Charles, a knife boy from Briar, comes to visit her. He is the son of Mr Way and, it turns out, the nephew of Mrs Cream. Charles, a simple boy, has been pining for the charming attentions of Gentleman to such an extent that Mr Way, the warden of Briar, had begun to beat him severely. Charles runs away, and has been directed to the asylum by Mrs Cream, who has no idea of the nature of the place. With Charles' recognition of her helping Sue accept her own memories as fact, she quickly enlists his help in her escape, persuading him to purchase a blank key and a file to give to her on his next visit. This he does, and Sue, using the skills learnt growing up in the Borough, escapes from the asylum and travels with Charles to London, with the intention of returning to Mrs Sucksby and her home in Lant Street. On arrival, an astonished Sue sees Maud at her bedroom window. After days of watching the activity of her old home from a nearby boarding house, Sue sends Charles with a letter explaining all to Mrs Sucksby, still believing that it was Maud and Gentleman alone who deceived her. Charles returns, saying Maud intercepted the letter, and sent Sue a playing card ‚Äì the Two of Hearts, representing lovers ‚Äì in reply. Sue takes the token as a joke, and storms into the house to confront Maud, half-mad with rage. She tells everything to Mrs Sucksby, who pretends to have known nothing, and despite Mrs Sucksby's repeated attempts to calm her, swears she will kill Maud for what she has done to her. Gentleman arrives, and though initially shocked at Sue's escape, laughingly begins to tell Sue how Mrs Sucksby played her for a fool. Maud physically tries to stop him, knowing how the truth would devastate Sue; a scuffle between Maud, Gentleman and Mrs Sucksby ensues, and in the confusion, Gentleman is stabbed by the knife Sue had brought with her to kill Maud. He bleeds to death. A hysterical Charles alerts the police. Mrs Sucksby, at last sorry for how she has deceived the two girls, immediately confesses to the murder: \\"Lord knows, I'm sorry for it now; but I done it. And these girls here are innocent girls, and know nothing at all about it; and have harmed no- one.\\" Mrs Sucksby is hanged for killing Gentleman; it is revealed that Richard Rivers was not a shamed gentleman at all, but a draper's son named Frederick Bunt, who had had ideas above his station. Maud disappears, though Sue sees her briefly at Mrs Sucksby's trial and gathers from the prison matrons that Maud had been visiting Mrs Sucksby in the days leading up to her death. Sue remains unaware of her true parentage until she finds the will of Marianne Lilly tucked in the folds of Mrs Sucksby's gown. Realising everything, an overwhelmed Sue sets out to find Maud, beginning by returning to Briar. It is there she finds Maud, and the nature of Christopher Lilly's work is finally revealed to Sue. It is further revealed that Maud is now writing erotic fiction to sustain herself financially, publishing her stories in The Pearl, a pornographic magazine run by one of her uncle's friends in London, William Lazenby. The two girls, still very much in love with each other despite everything, make peace and give vent to their feelings at last.

Reviewers have praised Waters' negotiation of sexual themes; a review from The Guardian describes it as \\"erotic and unnerving\\", while the New York Times praises its \\"illicit undertow\\". Literary critics have also focused on the novel's sexual themes, and identified its engagement with debates surrounding feminism and pornography. In Fingersmith, Waters uses her depiction of lesbian love between Maud and Sue to challenge a variety of hetero-patriarchal norms, and respond to different feminist arguments about pornography. Outside of discussions about sexuality, the struggles that Maud and Sue both face as women in Victorian society, and their often exploitative relationships with men are also of interest to feminist critics. The novel's title is likely intended to reflect the erotic themes of the novel. Fingersmith is an archaic term for a petty thief, but given the content of the novel, it can also be assumed to have intentionally sexual connotations. Waters is known for writing lesbian fiction, and is a lesbian herself. Allusions/references to other works *In her Notes on the Text, Waters informs the reader that the book Christopher Lilly and Maud are working on is actually based on bibliographies published by Henry Spencer Ashbee, under the pseudonym Pisanus Fraxi, in the late 1870s. Waters makes it clear, however, that though Lilly's sentiments on book-keeping echo those of Ashbee, he is in all other aspects entirely fictitious. *Waters also states in the Notes that all of the texts cited by Maud in Fingersmith actually existed, and lists their titles accordingly.

The molecule behaves like a flexible elastic rod/beam (beam theory). Informally, for pieces of the polymer that are shorter than the persistence length, the molecule behaves like a rigid rod, while for pieces of the polymer that are much longer than the persistence length, the properties can only be described statistically, like a three-dimensional random walk. Formally, the persistence length, P, is defined as the length over which correlations in the direction of the tangent are lost. In a more chemical based manner it can also be defined as the average sum of the projections of all bonds j ‚â• i on bond i in an infinitely long chain. Let us define the angle Œ∏ between a vector that is tangent to the polymer at position 0 (zero) and a tangent vector at a distance L away from position 0, along the contour of the chain. It can be shown that the expectation value of the cosine of the angle falls off exponentially with distance, : \\\\langle\\\\cos{\\\\theta}\\\\rangle = e^{-(L/P)} \\\\, where P is the persistence length and the angled brackets denote the average over all starting positions. The persistence length is considered to be one half of the Kuhn length, the length of hypothetical segments that the chain can be considered as freely joined. The persistence length equals the average projection of the end-to-end vector on the tangent to the chain contour at a chain end in the limit of infinite chain length. The persistence length can be also expressed using the bending stiffness B_s , the Young's modulus E and knowing the section of the polymer chain. : P=\\\\frac{B_s}{k_BT}\\\\, where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. : B_s=EI\\\\, In the case of a rigid and uniform rod, I can be expressed as: : I=\\\\frac{\\\\pi a^4}{4}\\\\, where a is the radius. For charged polymers the persistence length depends on the surrounding salt concentration due to electrostatic screening. The persistence length of a charged polymer is described by the OSF (Odijk, Skolnick and Fixman) model.Persistence Length of Polyelectrolyte Chains http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/24/5/003/meta  Examples  For example, a piece of uncooked spaghetti has a persistence length on the order of 10^{18} m (taking in consideration a Young modulus of 5 GPa and a radius of 1 mm). Double-helical DNA has a persistence length of about 390 √•ngstr√∂ms. Such large persistent length for spaghetti does not mean that it is not flexible. It just means that its stiffness is such that it needs 10^{18} m of length for thermal fluctuations at 300K to bend it. Another example: Imagine a long cord that is slightly flexible. At short distance scales, the cord will basically be rigid. If you look at the direction the cord is pointing at two points that are very close together, the cord will likely be pointing in the same direction at those two points (i.e. the angles of the tangent vectors are highly correlated). If you choose two points on this flexible cord (imagine a piece of cooked spaghetti that you've just tossed on your plate) that are very far apart, however, the tangent to the cords at those locations will likely be pointing in different directions (i.e. the angles will be uncorrelated). If you plot out how correlated the tangent angles at two different points are as a function of the distance between the two points, you'll get a plot that starts out at 1 (perfect correlation) at a distance of zero and drops exponentially as distance increases. The persistence length is the characteristic length scale of that exponential decay. For the case of a single molecule of DNA the persistence length can be measured using optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy. Tools for measurement of persistence length Persistence length measurement of single stranded DNA is viable by various tools. Most of them have been done by incorporation of the worm-like chain model. For example, two ends of single stranded DNA were tagged by donor and acceptor dyes to measure average end to end distance which is represented as FRET efficiency. It was converted to persistence length by comparing the FRET efficiency with calculated FRET efficiency based on models such as the worm-like chain model.Huimin Chen et al, Ionic strength-dependent persistence lengths of single-stranded RNA and DNA, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (2012) DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1119057109Jooyoun Kang et al, Ionic strength-dependent persistence lengths of single-stranded RNA and DNA, Biophysical Chemistry (2014) DOI: 10.1016/j.bpc.2014.08.004 The recent attempts to obtain persistence length is combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with HYDRO program. HYDRO program is simply noted as the upgrade of Stokes‚ÄìEinstein equation. The Stokes‚ÄìEinstein equation calculates diffusion coefficient (which is inversely proportional to diffusion time) by assuming the molecules as pure sphere. However, the HYDRO program has no limitation regarding to the shape of molecule. For estimation of single stranded DNA persistence length, the diffusion time of number of worm-like chain polymer was generated and its diffusion time is calculated by the HYDRO program which is compared with the experiment diffusion time of FCS. The polymer property was adjusted to find the optimal persistence length.

Smirnov and D. Smirnov-Sadovsky. He wrote operas, symphonies, string quartets and other chamber music, and vocal music from song to oratorio. Many of his works were inspired by the art of William Blake.  Career  Smirnov was born in Minsk into a family of opera singers: his parents were Nikolay Senkin-Sadovsky and Eugenia Smirnova. His family moved to Ulan-Ude and then Bishkek, where he spent most of his childhood. He studied at the Moscow Conservatory from 1967 to 1972, composition with Nikolai Sidelnikov, instrumentation with Yuri Kholopov, and analysis with Edison Denisov. He also studied privately with Philip Herschkowitz, a pupil of Anton Webern. He worked as an editor for the music publishing house Sovietski Kompositor from 1973 to 1980, and then turned to freelance composing. He received first prize for his composition Solo for Harp at a competition of the International Harp Week in Maastricht in 1976, which won him international recognition. In 1979, Smirnov was blacklisted as one of \\"Khrennikov's Seven\\" at the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Composers for unapproved participation in some festivals of Soviet music in the West. Smirnov was one of the founders of Russia's new ACM - Association for Contemporary Music, established in Moscow in 1990. From 1991, he lived in England. He was composer in residence at the University of Cambridge's St John's College at Dartington, and visiting professor at Keele University from 1993 to 1998. From 2003 he taught at Goldsmiths College at the University of London. Many of Smirnov's works reflect his fascination with the poetry and art of William Blake. He composed a song cycle based on Blake's The Season (1979), which grew into his first symphony, subtitled The Seasons. His two operas Tiriel and Thel on text by William Blake were premiered in 1989, the first at the Freiburg Festival in Germany, and the second at the Almeida Theatre in London. His First Symphony was premiered the same year at the Tanglewood Festival and the Southbank Centre in London. His orchestral Mozart- Variations were staged as a ballet in Pforzheim in Germany in 1992. Other premieres include the oratorio A Song of Liberty in Leeds in 1993, played by the BBC Philharmonic, the Cello Concerto in Manchester in 1996, the cantata Song of Songs in Geneva in 2001, and the Triple Concerto No. 2 for violin, double bass and harp, which was performed at the Barbican Centre on 26 May 2004, combined with Mahler's Second Symphony \\"Resurrection\\", with Andrew Davis conducting the London Symphony Orchestra & Chorus. His work has been performed by many notable conductors, including: Riccardo Muti, Sir Andrew Davis, Dennis Russell Davies, Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Oliver Knussen, Vassily Sinaisky, Pavel Kogan, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Gunther Schuller, and Yan Pascal Tortelier. He composed Jacob's Ladder and River of Life for the London Sinfonietta, String Quartets Nos. 3 and 6 for the Brodsky Quartet, Song of Songs on a commission from the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, and Between Scylla and Charybdis for the string orchestras and the English String Orchestra.  Personal life  Smirnov was married to the composer Elena Firsova. They moved to the United Kingdom in 1991, living in St Albans near London from 1998. Their children are Philip Firsov (an artist and sculptor) and Alissa Firsova (a composer, pianist and conductor). He died on 9 April 2020 in Watford during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He is known for his \\"slogan\\" art, is an associate professor at Sir John Cass Department of Art at London Metropolitan University and has been curator of public art projects, like Art U Need. He was curator for the 2006 Peace Camp and created the 2013 Art Party to promote contemporary art and advocacy. His works have been exhibited and are in collections in Europe and the United States. Brill co-founded The Ken Ardley Playboys and hosts the Make Your Own Damn Music radio show. His father is the landscape painter Frederick Brill who was head of the Chelsea School of Art from 1965 to 1979. His wife is the contemporary artist and lecturer, Jessica Voorsanger. Life and work Patrick Brill is the son of Frederick Brill (1920‚Äì1984), who was the Chelsea Art School head and his wife, the artist Deirdre Borlase. He has a sister who is a psychiatric nurse, Roberta. He graduated from the University of Reading and received a scholarship during that time to The British School at Rome. He then obtained his Master of Arts at Goldsmiths College, London. Brill is married to fellow artist and Goldsmiths College alumna, Jessica Voorsanger. Brill was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the arts. Career =Art= Taxy (1999) by Bob and Roberta Smith, a work from the Cab Gallery Brill is commonly known as Bob and Roberta Smith in his artistic career. The pseudonym has been retained from the short lived period when he worked with his sister Roberta. Smith paints slogans in a brightly coloured lettering style on banners and discarded boards of wood and exhibits them in galleries of contemporary art across the world. The slogans are usually humorous musing on art, politics, popular culture, Britain and the world in general and they often support his activist campaigns, such as his 2002 amnesty on bad art at Pierogi Gallery, New York. Noted for sign painting, Smith also makes sculpture using cement, as in his 2005 Cement Soup Kitchen at Beaconsfield Gallery, London. A sculpture he proposed was shortlisted for the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London. In March 2005 he was commissioned to act as curator on a series of five public art projects in the Thames Gateway housing estates of Essex. The projects were collectively named Art U Need and were documented in a diary-format book by Smith in 2007.Smith, Bob and Roberta. 2007. Art U Need: My Part in the Public Art Revolution London: Black Dog Publishing Writing of a \\"glittering Notting Hill Gate\\" event to introduce the project, Lynn Barber said of Smith: \\"It was a startlingly unsuitable subject for such a glossy audience, but he held them spellbound. I see him as a sort of Ian Dury of the art world, someone who keeps on trucking, doing his own thing, making absolutely no concessions to fashion or marketability, but generally giving pleasure to everyone who comes across him.\\" A feature documentary about the work of Bob and Roberta Smith, Make Your Own Damn Art: the world of Bob and Roberta Smith, directed by John Rogers, premiered at the East End Film Festival in 2012. In 2013, he was on the UK Museum of the Year selection panel. He is on the Tate board as an artist member. =Speaker, writer and advocate= He has spoken as an advocate for art education and the arts and has been a keynote speaker at symposia and conferences. A recent example of his gift for merging art and politics was illustrated in the 2006 exhibition, \\"Peace Camp.\\" Smith took part in and curated the show held at The Brick Lane Gallery that explored artists perceptions on Peace. Gavin Turk, Wolfgang Tillmans, and more than 100 other artists were featured. He created a project, the Art Party, in 2013 to make contemporary art more accessible, demonstrate its ability to influence meaningful conversation and political thought. It was launched at the Pierogi Gallery in New York and at the Hales Gallery. An Arts Council sponsored a two- day conference at Crescent Arts in North Yorkshire that year. It brought more than 2000 people who attended discussions of art education in schools and lectures, listened to music and attended performances. Brill writes for The Guardian. =Educator= Brill is an associate professor at the Sir John Cass Department of Art, Media and Design at London Metropolitan University, teaching bachelor and graduate students. He is also a course leader for the Master of Fine Arts program, researcher and co-lead with Oriana Fox of the Public Acts studio and tutors in fine art. =Musician= Brill performs music, often with a group he co-founded, The Ken Ardley Playboys, who had their first 45 released by Billy Childish on his label Hangman Records.

Countries with at least one round-tower church include Andorra, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Poland and South Africa. The distinctive feature of these churches is their round towers. The reason for their construction ‚Äì mostly by the Anglo- Saxons ‚Äì is a matter of dispute. Suggested explanations include the following: *Round-tower churches are found in areas lacking normal building stone, and are therefore built of knapped flint. Corners are difficult to construct in flint, hence the thick, round walls of the towers. *The churches are found in areas subject to raids from, for example, the Vikings, and were built as defensive structures, churches being added later. In fact, however, the towers are generally too short to have been of much use defensively, and the towers were often added to existing churches, having flat walls where they joined the main structure. *In 937 King Athelstan (924‚Äì939), the first King of all England, decrees that a bell tower be built on the land of every thane; an existing trend of building bell towers on to existing churches was thus accelerated. Many other (less likely) explanations are offered in communities containing the churches, including appeals to ancient stone circles and the remains of wells. Round-tower churches should not be confused with similarly shaped structures such as the Irish round towers found in Ireland and Scotland, or with round churches, which have a circular plan and are often found in Denmark or Sweden.

The station was built on the New Brighton branch of the Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway, between Wallasey Grove Road and New Brighton stations, opening on 30 March 1888. The branch became part of the Wirral Railway on 1 July 1891. Remotely situated, the station only ever served a small part of the community (and the local golf course). This, combined with an infrequent service, and the later introduction of a tram service on Warren Drive, meant the station was little used, and it was closed on 1 October 1915. The station had one siding nearby, on the seaward side, which was possibly used for the transportation of sand. The foundations of the up platform are extant, and were revealed during engineering work in 2006. The line past the station site remains in use as part of the Wirral Line, now operated by Merseyrail.

It Was Lin Dai's Last Film Plot Property company chairman Hu Zian was attracted to his secretary Sun Yuxia's beauty and competence. One day after dinner when Hu was escorting Sun home, he received from a child on the street a box containing a mirror and two silver coins engraved with dragons. He was so frightened that he was absent from the office the following day. Sun went to visit him at home and Hu asked her to stay. Sun refused and left. In another occasion Hu asked Sun to follow him to inspection outside, during which there was a heavy downpour which soaked them both. They were forced to stay in a hotel, where Hu tried to force his intentions on Sun. Sun resisted with vigour and threatened to resign from office. Enraged at Sun's stubbornness, Hu urged his driver to spread the rumour in the office that Sun had stayed with him in a hotel. As Sun was annoyed and embarrassed, Hu proposed to her. Sun laid down a list of conditions and demanded his acceptance before marriage. Hu agreed. On the first night of their wedding Hu found that Sun had divided their bedroom into two partitions with an unlocked sliding door. Hu and Sun lived in one of these, and Sun's partition was decorated with mirrors. This frightened Hu so much that he remembered an early episode of his life: More than two decades ago, when the Second Sino-Japanese War was still going on, Hu worked in an inn under the name Hu Amao. One day he picked up two silver coins engraved with dragons and took them in possession, without knowing that they actually belonged to a traitor. One day a friend of the inn owner Tao Ajiu came and stayed in the inn. The inner owner and Hu collaborated to put him in trouble so that they could grab his valuables. As the police were tracking down the traitor, they found the two silver coins under Tao's pillow. Tao could not prove his innocence but plunged to his death. Hu was so horrified that he could never forget Tao's dead face as reflected in a mirror. At midnight Hu escaped with the inn owner, who wanted to kill Hu but was instead injured badly. Seeing that Hu was so panicked, Sun asked him to tell her what happened, but Hu did not utter a word. On the second night Hu made his way to Sun's partition, where he heard a terrible voice calling his old name. Hu was so scared that he fell and fainted. When Hu recovered consciousness he was suspicious of Sun. He made an excuse to send her out and investigated into the matter. Finally he found that it was all Sun's plot and locked her up in the basement. Knowing that she could conceal no more, Sun admitted that she had approached Hu in revenge for her father, Tao. Furious at her plot, Hu wanted to kill her but Uncle Fan, the inn owner, appeared and fought with him. Eventually both men die, leaving Sun lost in her thoughts in front of the mirror.

Viable is defined as the ability to multiply via binary fission under the controlled conditions. Counting with colony-forming units requires culturing the microbes and counts only viable cells, in contrast with microscopic examination which counts all cells, living or dead. The visual appearance of a colony in a cell culture requires significant growth, and when counting colonies it is uncertain if the colony arose from one cell or a group of cells. Expressing results as colony-forming units does not distinguish. Theory A dilution made with bacteria and peptoned water is placed in an Agar plate (Agar plate count for food samples or Trypticase soy agar for clinic samples) and spread over the plate by tipping in the pattern shown. The purpose of plate counting is to estimate the number of cells present based on their ability to give rise to colonies under specific conditions of nutrient medium, temperature and time. Theoretically, one viable cell can give rise to a colony through replication. However, solitary cells are the exception in nature, and most likely the progenitor of the colony was a mass of cells deposited together. In addition, many bacteria grow in chains (e.g. Streptococcus) or clumps (e.g., Staphylococcus). Estimation of microbial numbers by CFU will, in most cases, undercount the number of living cells present in a sample for these reasons. This is because the counting of CFU assumes that every colony is separate and founded by a single viable microbial cell. The plate count is linear for E. coli over the range of 30 to 300 CFU on a standard sized Petri dish. Therefore, to ensure that a sample will yield CFU in this range requires dilution of the sample and plating of several dilutions. Typically ten-fold dilutions are used, and the dilution series is plated in replicates of 2 or 3 over the chosen range of dilutions. The CFU/plate is read from a plate in the linear range, and then the CFU/g (or CFU/mL) of the original is deduced mathematically, factoring in the amount plated and its dilution factor. serially diluted in order to obtain at least one plate with a countable number of bacteria. In this figure, the \\"x10\\" plate is suitable for counting. An advantage to this method is that different microbial species may give rise to colonies that are clearly different from each other, both microscopically and macroscopically. The colony morphology can be of great use in the identification of the microorganism present. A prior understanding of the microscopic anatomy of the organism can give a better understanding of how the observed CFU/mL relates to the number of viable cells per milliliter. Alternatively it is possible to decrease the average number of cells per CFU in some cases by vortexing the sample before conducting the dilution. However many microorganisms are delicate and would suffer a decrease in the proportion of cells that are viable when placed in a vortex. =Log notation= Concentrations of colony-forming units can be expressed using logarithmic notation, where the value shown is the base 10 logarithm of the concentration. This allows the log reduction of a decontamination process to be computed as a simple subtraction. Uses Colony-forming units are used to quantify results in many microbiological plating and counting methods, including: * The Pour Plate method wherein the sample is suspended in a Petri dish using molten agar cooled to approximately 40-45 ¬∞C (just above the point of solidification to minimize heat-induced cell death). After the nutrient agar solidifies the plate is incubated. * The Spread Plate method wherein the sample (in a small volume) is spread across the surface of a nutrient agar plate and allowed to dry before incubation for counting. * The Membrane Filter method wherein the sample is filtered through a membrane filter, then the filter placed on the surface of a nutrient agar plate (bacteria side up). During incubation nutrients leach up through the filter to support the growing cells. As the surface area of most filters is less than that of a standard Petri dish, the linear range of the plate count will be less. * The Miles and Misra Methods or drop-plate method wherein a very small aliquot (usually about 10 microliters) of sample from each dilution in series is dropped onto a Petri dish. The drop dish must be read while the colonies are very small to prevent the loss of CFU as they grow together. However, with the techniques that require the use of an agar plate, no fluid solution can be used because the purity of the specimen cannot be unidentified and it is not possible to count the cells one by one in the liquid. Tools for counting colonies The traditional way of enumerating CFUs with a \\"click-counter\\" and a pen. When the colonies are too numerous, it is common practice to count CFUs only on a fraction of the dish. Counting colonies is traditionally performed manually using a pen and a click-counter. This is generally a straightforward task, but can become very laborious and time-consuming when many plates have to be enumerated. Alternatively semi- automatic (software) and automatic (hardware + software) solutions can be used. =Software for counting CFUs= Colonies can be enumerated from pictures of plates using software tools. The experimenters would generally take a picture of each plate they need to count and then analyse all the pictures (this can be done with a simple digital camera or even a webcam). Since it takes less than 10 seconds to take a single picture, as opposed to several minutes to count CFU manually, this approach generally saves a lot of time. In addition, it is more objective and allows extraction of other variables such as the size and colour of the colonies. * OpenCFU is a free and open-source program designed to optimise user friendliness, speed and robustness. It offers a wide range of filters and control as well as a modern user interface. OpenCFU is written in C++ and uses OpenCV for image analysis. * NICE is a program written in MATLAB that provides an easy way to count colonies from images.https://www.nist.gov/pml/div686/sources_detectors/nice.cfm * ImageJ and CellProfiler: Some ImageJ macros and plugins and some CellProfiler pipelines can be used to count colonies. This often requires the user to change the code in order to achieve an efficient work-flow, but can prove useful and flexible. One main issue is the absence of specific GUI which can make the interaction with the processing algorithms tedious. In addition to software based on traditional desktop computers, apps for both Android and iOS devices are available for semi-automated and automated colony counting. The integrated camera is used to take pictures of the agar plate and either an internal or an external algorithm is used to process the picture data and to estimate the number of colonies. =Automated systems= Many of the automated systems are used to counteract human error as many of the research techniques done by humans counting individual cells have a high chance of error involved. Due to the fact that researchers regularly manually count the cells with the assistance of a transmitted light, this error prone technique can have a significant effect on the calculated concentration in the main liquid medium when the cells are in low numbers. An automated colony counter using image processing. Completely automated systems are also available from some biotechnology manufacturers. They are generally expensive and not as flexible as standalone software since the hardware and software are designed to work together for a specific set-up. Alternatively, some automatic systems use the spiral plating paradigm. Some of the automated systems such as the systems from MATLAB allow the cells to be counted without having to stain them. This lets the colonies to be reused for other experiments without the risk of killing the microorganisms with stains. However, a disadvantage to these automated systems is that it is extremely difficult to differentiate between the microorganisms with dust or scratches on blood agar plates because both the dust and scratches can create a highly diverse combination of shapes and appearances. =Alternative units= Instead of colony-forming units, the parameters Most Probable Number (MPN) and Modified Fishman Units (MFU) can be used. The Most Probable Number method counts viable cells and is useful when enumerating low concentrations of cells or enumerating microbes in products where particulates make plate counting impractical. Modified Fishman Units take into account bacteria which are viable, but non-culturable.

It operates 14 hospitals and employs over 18,000 full- and part-time employees. History Mother Maria Theresia Bonzel founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration in 1863 in Olpe, Germany. Drawn to the ideals of St. Francis, Mother Theresia cared for poor and neglected children and for persons in need of healthcare. In 1875, she sent sisters to Indiana where the mission grew to include hospitals, schools, orphanages and homes for the aged. St. Elizabeth Hospital, now Franciscan Health Lafayette Central in Lafayette, was the first facility founded by the sisters in America. In 1931 the sisters divided into eastern and western provinces, the eastern centered at Mishawaka, Indiana. In 1974, the sisters of the eastern province incorporated their healthcare ministry under the name of the Sisters of St. Francis Health Services, Inc. All related healthcare activities were consolidated into this corporation with a separate board and management staff. In 1986, the corporate offices were moved to their current location on the provincialate grounds in Mishawaka. In November 2010, Sisters of St. Francis Health Services, Inc., changed its name to Franciscan Alliance, Inc.

He is best known for a series of simple but competent locomotives produced under his direction at the company's Ashford railway works in the early years of the twentieth century. Many of these survived in service until the end of steam traction in Britain in 1968, and are regarded as some of the most elegant designs of the period. Biography Wainwright was born at Worcester on 16 November 1864, the third son of William Wainwright. In 1896, he was appointed Carriage & Wagon Superintendent of the South Eastern Railway (SER), in succession to his father. On 1 January 1899, the SER entered into a working union with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR); their respective Locomotive Superintendents, James Stirling and William Kirtley, both retired, and the newly formed South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) decided to combine the locomotive, carriage and wagon departments of the two railways, and appoint Wainwright as the Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. Robert Surtees, the former LCDR Chief Draughtsman, became Chief Draughtsman of the SECR. Wainwright retired on 30 November 1913. Wainwright died on 19 September 1925. Locomotives The first locomotives to be placed in service by the SECR under Wainwright's supervision were not of his design. Until new standard designs could be prepared, which would be acceptable on both the SER and LCDR sections of the SECR, it was necessary to fulfil immediate locomotive requirements in other ways. Existing locomotive orders were allowed to stand; further orders were placed for existing designs (in some cases design modifications were made); and locomotives built to the designs of an entirely different company were purchased from a manufacturer's unsold stock. Five 4-4-0 express passenger engines of Kirtley's M3 class, which had been introduced on the LCDR in 1891, were built at Longhedge between May 1899 and May 1901. Two of these were the balance of an outstanding LCDR order; the remainder formed part of an order for ten placed by the SECR, of which seven were later cancelled. Five 4-4-0 express passenger engines of Stirling's B class, which had been introduced on the SER in 1898, were built at Ashford in June and July 1899. Five 0-6-0 goods engines of Stirling's O class, which had been introduced on the SER in 1878, were built at Ashford in August and September 1899. The locomotive manufacturer Neilson, Reid and Company had built ten 4-4-0 express passenger engines in late 1899 to the design of William Pickersgill for the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) where they formed Class V. After the GNoSR decided that only five were required, Neilson's were left with the remainder on their hands, and were asked by the GNoSR to sell them for the best possible price. They were offered to the SECR, which agreed to take the five engines which the GNoSR did not need, subject to certain modifications being made. They were delivered to the SECR in January and February 1900, where they formed the G class. Fifteen 0-4-4T suburban passenger engines, the R1 class (based on Kirtley's R class of 1891) were built by Sharp, Stewart & Co in November and December 1900. The first designs which credited Wainwright as designer began to appear in 1900. In almost all cases, the actual design work was supervised by Surtees, with Wainwright specifying broad requirements and also deciding the finish and livery. The C class of 0-6-0 goods engines comprised 109 locomotives built between 1900 and 1908, of which 15 each were built by the contractors Neilson, Reid and Sharp, Stewart; the remainder were built by the SECR, 60 at Ashford and 9 at Longhedge. The D class of 4-4-0 express passenger engines comprised 51 locomotives built between 1901 and 1907, of which 30 were built by four different contractors, and 21 were built by the SECR at Ashford. The H class of 0-4-4T suburban passenger engines comprised 64 locomotives built at Ashford between 1904 and 1909, with a final two completed in 1915 after Wainwright's retirement. Eight steam railcars were bought from Kitson & Co. in 1905-6 for use on local passenger services. The E class of 4-4-0 express passenger engines comprised 26 locomotives built at Ashford between 1905 and 1909. The P class of 0-6-0T local passenger engines comprised eight locomotives built at Ashford in 1909-10. The J class of 0-6-4T passenger engines comprised five locomotives built at Ashford in 1913. The L class of 4-4-0 express passenger engines comprised 22 locomotives built by contractors in 1914. Although the specification was drawn up by Wainwright, and the design work supervised by Surtees, the order was not placed until after Wainwright's retirement; his successor, Richard Maunsell, specified some design changes. 12 came from Beyer, Peacock & Co., whilst the other ten were built in Berlin by A. Borsig; these were delivered before the outbreak of war on 3 August 1914, but were not paid for until May 1920.

The group, which consisted of philosophers, professionals, and members of the Religious Philosophical Society, sought to support the Bolsheviks' economic policy but oppose their atheistic culture, and in so doing to 'renew humanity and the construction of communism' (as seen in Brandist 2002, p. 28). First gathering In December 1917, several employees of the Imperial Public Library gathered at the flat of philosopher Georgy Fedotov to discuss the recent October Revolution and the manner with which the intelligentsia should respond to the social revolution. Continuing in traditions of the masonic Religious- Philosophic Society, which had been run by their mentors - Dmitry Merezhkovsky and his wife Zinaida Gippius - the group critically accepted the revolution, but urged that people be free to express their spiritual beliefs. Leadership and themes By March 1918, the circle included at least 18 formally recognised members. The leaders were Fedorov and Alexander Meyer, who argued for the union (smychka) of Christianity and social revolution (ibid.). The majority of participants of the circle were skeptical about the official position of the Russian Orthodox Church, believing that free development of Christian ideas within the Church was impossible. Meetings were held in the apartments of the Free Philosophical Association, though after they were closed in 1923, the meetings were held in the flats of K.A. Polovtsova (7 Maly Avenue of Petrogradskaya Side) and P.F. Smotritsky (18 Geslerovsky Lane); in 1917-28, no fewer than 150 people attended these meetings. The main discussion themes included revolution and power, religion, and society. The painter Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin occasionally visited the circle's meetings, as did philologists M.M Bakhtin and Lev Pumpyansky, although Bakhtin and Pumpyansky appeared not to have any formal connection to the group (Hirschkop 1999: p. 168). In 1918, members of the circle issued a periodical, Free Voices, although it proved to be short lived, it was published only twice, having been discontinued after opposition from Merezhkovsky. The name Voskresenie By the end of 1919, the group officially assumed the name of Voskresenie, which is the Russian word both for \\"Sunday\\" and for \\"Resurrection\\". The name reflected their hopes to see the social revolution resurrect spiritual freedoms. By this time eleven people formed the core of Voskresenie, and they organized the fraternity \\"Christ and Freedom\\", which secretly convened on Tuesdays and discussed the possibility of facilitating the merger of social revolution and Christianity. The fraternity was disbanded in 1923, on account of disagreements between its members. Disbanded After Fedorov emigrated two years later, the society came to be dominated by Meyer, who used his charismatic aura and rhetorical skill to turn the circle into a sort of religious sect or masonic lodge. On 8 December 1928, when the society was about to mark its 10th anniversary, Meyer, Bakhtin, and (about 100) other individuals associated with Voskresenie were apprehended by the OGPU (Hirschkop 1999: p. 168). The subsequent trial resulted in the Voskresenie leaders being sentenced up to ten years in labour camps. Bakhtin was found guilty for his association with the circle and on 1929-07-22 he was sentenced to five years in Siberia. Approximately 70 people were sentenced by Decree of the Collegium of the Joint State Political Administration Board on 22 July 1929.

Resurrection Gate ( Voskresenskie vorota, also called –ò–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ—Ä–æ—Ç–∞ Iverskie vorota, or Iberian Gate) is the only existing gate of the Kitai-gorod in Moscow. It connects the north-western end of Red Square with Manege Square and gives its name to nearby Voskresenskaya Square (Resurrection Square). The gate adjoins the ornate building of the Moscow City Hall to the east and the State Historical Museum to the west. Just in front of the chapel is a bronze plaque marking kilometre zero of the Russian highway system. Resurrection Gate The first stone gate leading to Red Square was erected in 1535, when the Kitai-gorod wall was being reconstructed in brick. When the structure was rebuilt in 1680, the double passage was surmounted with two-storey chambers crowned by two octagonal hipped roofs similar to the Kremlin towers. An Icon of the Resurrection was placed on the gate facing towards Red Square, from which the gate derives its name. Until 1731, the chambers above the gate were shared by the neighbouring Mint and the Central Drug Store. After Mikhail Lomonosov founded the Moscow University in the latter structure, the university press moved into the gate chambers. Nikolay Novikov, who ran the press in the late 18th century, turned the second storey into his headquarters. Iveron Chapel The heavenly blue, star-studded dome of the little chapel is sandwiched between the twin arches of the gate. Since 1669, the wooden chapel in front of the gate (facing away from Red Square) has housed a replica of the miracle-working icon of Panaghia Portaitissa (\\"keeper of the gate\\"), the prototype of which is preserved in the Georgian Iveron monastery on Mount Athos. Hence, the name Iversky (that is, \\"Iberian\\") that stuck both to the chapel and the gate. In 1781, the Nikolo-Perervinsky Monastery constructed a new brick chapel on the spot. The star-splattered cupola of the structure was topped with a statue of an angel bearing a cross. According to a popular custom, everyone heading for Red Square or the Kremlin visited the chapel to pay homage at the shrine, before entering through the gate. Beggars and outlaws would pray there next to the highest royalty and even the Tsar himself. It was there that the rebel Emelyan Pugachev asked the Russian people for forgiveness a few hours before his execution. The ever- overcrowded chapel, with candles burning day and night, figures in works by Leo Tolstoy,Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace, book 8, chapter VI Ivan Bunin, Marina Tsvetayeva, and H.G. Wells,The celebrated miraculous shrine of the Iberian Madonna outside the Redeemer Gate was particularly busy. There were many peasant women, unable to get into the little chapel, kissing the stones outside. to name only a few.  Destruction and rebuilding  In 1931, the Resurrection Gate and the chapel were demolished in order to make room for heavy military vehicles driving through Red Square during military parades. Both structures were completely rebuilt in 1994-1995, and a new icon of the Iveron Theotokos was painted on Mount Athos to replace the original.

It is the flagship journal of the American Geophysical Union. It contains original research on the physical, chemical, and biological processes that contribute to the understanding of the Earth, Sun, and solar system. It has seven sections: A (Space Physics), B (Solid Earth), C (Oceans), D (Atmospheres), E (Planets), F (Earth Surface), and G (Biogeosciences). All current and back issues are available online for subscribers.  History  The journal was originally founded under the name Terrestrial Magnetism by the American Geophysical Union's president Louis Agricola Bauer in 1896. It was entitled Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity from 1899‚Äì1948. In 1980, three specialized sections were established: A: Space Physics, B: Solid Earth, and C: Oceans. Subsequently, further sections have been added: D: Atmospheres in 1984, E: Planets in 1991, F: Earth Surface in 2003, and G: Biogeosciences in 2005.  Sections  The scopes of the current seven sections, published as separate issues, are: * A: Space Physics covers aeronomy and magnetospheric physics, planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres, interplanetary and external solar physics, cosmic rays, and heliospheric physics. * B: Solid Earth focuses on the physics and chemistry of the solid Earth and the liquid core of the Earth, geomagnetism, paleomagnetism, marine geology/geophysics, chemistry and physics of minerals, rocks, volcanology, seismology, geodesy, gravity, and tectonophysics. * C: Oceans covers physical, biological, and chemical oceanography. * D: Atmospheres covers atmospheric properties and processes, including the interaction of the atmosphere with other components of the Earth system. * E: Planets covers the geology, geophysics, geochemistry, atmospheres, biology, and dynamics of the planets, satellites, asteroids, rings, comets, and meteorites; planetary origins; and planetary detection. Studies of the Earth are included when they concern exogenic effects or the comparison of the Earth to other planets. * F: Earth Surface focuses on the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the form and function of the surface of the solid Earth over all temporal and spatial scales, including fluvial, eolian, and coastal sediment transport; hillslope mass movements; glacial and periglacial activity; weathering and pedogenesis; and surface manifestations of volcanism and tectonism. * G: Biogeosciences focuses on the interface between biology and the geosciences and attempts to understand the functions of the Earth system across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Each of the sections has one or more editors who are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the President of the American Geophysical Union for terms of three to four years. Each editor can in turn appoint associate editors. According to the Editor-in-Chief of JGR-Space Physics, \\"With the switch to Wiley, the separate sections of JGR were given distinct ISSN numbers.

It depicts Romania during World War II, focusing on the Royal Coup that toppled Ion Antonescu, the Axis-allied ConducƒÉtor and authoritarian Prime Minister. Reactions The film was criticized as being apologetic of Antonescu, whom it portrays as a martyr figure, without mention being made of his complicity in the Holocaust (see Holocaust in Romania).Liz Fekete, \\"Nostalgia for War-time Dictator Grows\\" , in Independent Race and Refugee News Network, May 1, 1994Radu Ioanid, \\"Romania\\", in David S.

Nicolaescu himself claims that journalist Octavian Paler labeled it a \\"fascist film\\". Presentation of Oglinda, on Sergiu Nicolaescu's official site The film was also criticized for several other errors. Historian and former public servant Neagu Djuvara, who in 1944 represented Antonescu's government to Stockholm, where he contacted the Soviet Union representative Alexandra Kollontai and unsuccessfully negotiated an armistice, rejected the film's allusive take on these events, which claimed that Romania's special requests had been ignored by their counterparts, and called it \\"a lie\\".

Speaking in 2008, Djuvara criticized Oglinda in its entirety for mystification, while expressing similar reserves in respect to Nicolaescu's 2008 project, a biographical film on Michael's ancestor Carol I (Carol I - Un destin).

As part of his commentary on Nicolaescu's entire filmography, beginning with films he produced under the communist regime, Valerian Sava depicted Nicolaescu as an untalented director caught in a \\"megalomaniac trance\\", and deemed Oglinda \\"a rudimentary historical reenactment\\".

It is a small ski resort in the French Alps, dominated by La Meije (3982 m). It was the birthplace of Nicolas de Nicolay; adventurer and Geographer Ordinary to Henry II of France. La Meije seen from the Lac Noir Skiing The area is unpisted and although patrolled, has no formal avalanche control. The area is dangerous to ski unless supported by a guide, including much glacier travel at the very top. La Grave is visited by off-piste and extreme skiers. The vertical drop totals 2,150 metres, although it is possible to ski below the resort to the road and increase the vertical descent to 2,300 metres. Mechanical access to the mountain is limited to a closed, two-stage, pulse gondola system. The first lift starts at 1,450 metres, runs through one intermediate station (known as P1 at 1,800 metres) then terminates at Peyrou d'Amont (2,400 metres). The second stage of the gondola runs directly from Peyrou d'Amont to the Col des Ruillans (3,200 metres). The top of the gondola then allows access to button lift (which is the world's only fully suspended surface lift) to reach the top of the Girose Glacier (3550m). The Girose Glacier can also be reached from the resort of Les Deux Alpes on the other side, although this entails a one to two kilometre walk. There are two main routes of descent. To the skier's right of the gondola station at the Col des Ruillans are 'Les Vallons de La Meije', a variation of which leads to the Trifides couloirs, and ultimately to the valley bottom and the Romanche River. Skiers can also make leftwards traverses to return to Peyrou d'Amont or P1 to avoid skiing the lower section which can be rocky or even grassy meadows in poor snow conditions. To the skier's left from the Col des Ruillans is known as the Chancel route (also accessible from the Girose Glacier) which leads to several couloirs (the Banane, Patou, Couloir du Lac) around the Lac de Puyvachier and the Refuge Evariste Chancel. Below this point skiers can either traverse right to return to P1 or descend directly to the valley floor and village of Les Fr√©aux via the steep Fr√©aux Couloir. Alternative descents include various routes to the south of the highest point of the lifts (the Dome de Lauze, at the top of the T-bar) in the Vallon du Diable. These lead to the village of St Christophe en Oisans from which alternative transport must be arranged in order to return to La Grave or to join the Deux Alpes lift system and return via the top of the Girose Glacier. There are several direct routes from the top of the Girose Glacier to the valley such as Chirouse and Orci√®res; these involve complex routefinding and sometimes abseils. Other routes include the Pan du Rideau and Y-Couloir, reached via a walk from the top of the first T-bar; they involve a steep ski down onto the Glacier du Rateau then rejoin the Vallons de La Meije. In April 2006 Doug Coombs died while trying to save a friend in the Couloir de Polichinelle. There are restaurants at Peyrou d'Amont and the Col des Ruillans, and food is served at the Refuge Evariste Chancel. Beds at both the Refuge and in a sleeping space in the Col des Ruillans restaurant. The lease on the cable car is due to expire in 2017. As of 2015, no one had shown interest in taking over the cable car.http://www.2alpesnet.com/news/a-new-cable-car-for-la-grave-la-grave-689004 Ice climbing La Grave is also a location for ice climbing. The valley receives little sun in winter and icefalls form on the valley sides. Climbing routes range from under 100 to over 300 metres long and are climbed in a number of pitches. Routes range from easy La Gorge II/3 to hard Diabolobite II/5+.

The road runs through wooded areas before heading along the east bank of the South Branch Raritan River, intersecting CR 667 and passing under Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line. The route runs near farms as it crosses the river and enters Branchburg Township. At this point, CR 567 intersects CR 667 again and becomes Pleasant Run Road before making a northeast turn onto South Branch Road, with CR 628 continuing northwest along Pleasant Run Road. Residential development increases as the route continues northeast and passes the Neshanic Valley Golf Course. CR 567 begins to run closer to the South Branch Raritan River again as it reaches a junction with CR 620.

Sometimes they are about wildlife or ecosystems in relationship to human beings. Such programmes are most frequently made for television, particularly for public broadcasting channels, but some are also made for the cinema medium. The proliferation of this genre occurred almost simultaneously alongside the production of similar television series. History =In cinema= Robert J. Flaherty's 1922 film Nanook of the North is typically cited as the first feature-length documentary. Decades later, Walt Disney Productions pioneered the serial theatrical release of nature-documentaries with its production of the True-Life Adventures series, a collection of fourteen full length and short subject nature films from 1948 to 1960.True- Life Adventures Prominent among those were The Living Desert (1953) and The Vanishing Prairie (1954), both written and directed by James Algar. The first full-length nature-documentary films pioneering colour underwater cinematography were the Italian film Sesto Continente (The Sixth Continent) and the French film Le Monde du silence (The Silent World). Directed by Folco Quilici Sesto Continente was shot in 1952 and first exhibited to Italian audiences in 1954. Sesto Continente as mentioned at the IMDB website The Silent World, shot in 1954 and 1955 by Jacques Cousteau and Louis Malle, was first released in 1956.In 1956 The Silent World was released in three different countries: France (May 26, 1956), Japan (August 15, 1956) and the United States (September 24, 1956). See the release information page at the IMDB website. Many other nature-documentary films followed in subsequent years, such as those made by Nicolas Vanier (The Last Trapper, 2004), Luc Jacquet (March of the Penguins, 2005), and Alastair Fothergill (African Cats, 2011), among others. =In television= In 1954, the BBC started airing Zoo Quest, featuring David Attenborough. Other early nature documentaries include Fur and Feathers shown on CBC from 1955 to 1956 and hosted by Ian McTaggart- Cowan.Ian McTaggart-Cowan bio shines light on pioneering TV nature program host, and Look, a studio-based BBC magazine-program with filmed inserts, hosted by Sir Peter Scott from 1955 to 1981. The first 50-minute weekly documentary series, The World About Us, began on BBC2 in 1967 with a color installment from the French filmmaker Haroun Tazieff, called \\"Volcano\\". Around 1982, the series changed its title to The Natural World, which the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol continues to produce . In 1961, Anglia Television produced the first of the award-winning Survival series. Between 1974 and 1980, the Spanish nature documentary television series El Hombre y la Tierra (The Man and the Earth), produced by TVE and presented by naturalist F√©lix Rodr√≠guez de la Fuente used 35 mm film, which posed significant logistic and technical challenges at the time. The show gained international recognition.https://Historia.Nationalgeographic.com.es/a/Felix-Rodriguez- Fuente-divulgador-mas-mediatico_15162 During the late 1970s and early 1980s, several other television companies round the world set up their own specialized natural-history departments, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Melbourne, Australia and TVNZ's unit in Dunedin, New Zealand ‚Äî both still in existence, the latter having changed its name to \\"NHNZ\\". ITV's contribution to the genre, Survival, became a prolific series of single films. It was eventually axed when the network introduced a controversial new schedule which many commentators have criticized as \\"dumbing down\\". Wildlife and natural history films have boomed in popularity and have become one of modern society's most important sources of information about the natural world. Yet film and television critics and scholars have largely ignored them. The BBC television series Walking With, narrated by Kenneth Branagh, used computer-generated imagery (CGI) and animatronics to film prehistoric life in a similar manner to other nature documentaries. The shows (Walking with Dinosaurs, Walking with Beasts, and Walking with Monsters) had three spinoffs, two of which featured Nigel Marven: Chased by Dinosaurs and Sea Monsters: A Walking with Dinosaurs Trilogy. Robert Winston presented Walking with Cavemen. Content =Overview= Most nature documentary films or television series focus on a particular species, ecosystem, or scientific idea (such as evolution). Although most take a scientific and educational approach, some anthropomorphise their subjects or present animals purely for the viewer's pleasure. In a few instances, they are in presented in ethnographic filmEthnographic film formats and contain stories that involve humans and their relationships with the natural world, as in Nanook of the North (1922), The Story of the Weeping Camel (2003), and Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life (1925). Although almost all have a human presenter, the role varies widely, ranging from explanatory voice-overs to extensive interaction or even confrontation with animals. Most nature documentaries are made for television and are usually of 45 to 50 minutes duration, but some are made as full-length cinematic presentations. Such films include: * Among the Great Apes with Michelle Yeoh (2009) * Animals Are Beautiful People (1974) * Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness (1927) * Coral Reef Adventure (2003) * The Cove (2009) * Encounters at the End of the World (2007) * Grizzly Man (2005) * The Last Paradises: On the Track of Rare Animals (1967) * The Leopard Son (1996) * The Living Desert (1953) * March of the Penguins (2005) * Microcosmos (1996) * Sharkwater (2006) * Serengeti Shall Not Die (1959) * The Silent World (1956) * The Story of the Weeping Camel (2003) * Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life (1925) * The Vanishing Prairie (1954) * The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill (2003) * White Wilderness (1958) * Winged Migration (2001) In addition, the BBC's The Blue Planet and Planet Earth series have both been adapted by BBC Worldwide and Greenlight Media for theatrical release.BBC Press Office: Planet Earth set for movie release In some cases, nature documentaries are produced in the short subject form and are subsequently screened in theaters or broadcast on television. Often they are about the relationship between humans and nature. Notable examples include: * Agafia's Taiga Life (2013) * Grand Canyon (1958) * In Beaver Valley (1950) * The Land (1942) 45-minute documentary made for the U.S. Department of Agriculture * The Plow That Broke the Plains (1936) * The River (1938) * Seal Island (1948) Every two years the Wildscreen Trust, of Bristol in the UK presents the Panda Awards for nature documentaries. =Criticism= The \\"naturalness\\" of nature documentaries has been disputed. Some, particularly those involving animals, have included footage of staged events that appear \\"natural\\" while actually contrived by filmmakers or occurring in captivity. In a famous example, Walt Disney's White Wilderness (1958), lemmings were herded to their deaths from a cliff by the filmmakers. Examples also occur in modern nature documentaries, such as Hidden Kingdoms (2014) and Blue Planet II (2017), indicating that such practices are still routine. Due to the difficulties of recording sounds on locations, it is common for nature documentary makers to record sounds in post-production using Foley and to use sound effect libraries. Compositing and computer-generated imagery are also sometimes used to construct shots. Wild animals are often filmed over weeks or months, so the footage must be condensed to form a narrative that appears to take place over a short space of time. Such narratives are also constructed to be as compelling as possible‚Äîrather than necessarily as a reflection of reality‚Äîand make frequent use of voice-overs, combined with emotional and intense music to maximise the audience's engagement with the content. One common technique is to follow the \\"story\\" of one particular animal, encouraging the audience to form an emotional connection with the subject and to root for their survival when they encounter a predator. In 1984, David Attenborough stated: > There is precious little that is natural ‚Ä¶ in any film. You distort speed if > you want to show things like plants growing, or look in detail at the way an > animal moves. You distort light levels. You distort distribution, in the > sense that you see dozens of different species in a jungle within a few > minutes, so that the places seem to be teeming with life. You distort size > by using close-up lenses. And you distort sound. What the filmmaker is > trying to do is to convey a particular experience. ‚Ä¶ The viewer has to trust > in the good faith of the filmmaker. Nature documentaries have been criticized for leaving viewers with the impression that wild animals survived and thrived after encounters with predators, even when they sustain potentially life-threatening injuries.

Two recent examples of co- productions that were filmed by the BBC are Planet Earth II (2016) and Blue Planet II (2017). Production companies are increasingly exploiting their filmed material, by making DVDs and Blu-rays for home viewing or educational purposes, or selling library footage to advertisers, museum exhibitors, and other documentary producers.

It is the successor of a grassroots people's movement which was formed during the 2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum campaign. This movement separated in August 2007 into the Orange Democratic Movement Party of Kenya and the Wiper Democratic Movement ‚Äì Kenya (formerly the Orange Democratic Movement ¬•Kenya, known as ODM‚ÄìKenya). The name \\"orange\\" originates from the ballot cards in the referendum, in which the banana represented a 'yes' vote, and the orange represented a 'no' vote. Thus the parties demonstrates that it supported a no vote in the 2005 referendum. The original linchpins of the ODM were Uhuru Kenyatta's KANU party and Raila Odinga's LDP. KANU has since pulled out. the ODM is led by Raila Odinga.  2005 constitutional referendum  In the 2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum the 'no' vote, which the ODM campaigned for, won with 58.12% of Kenyans voting down the proposed constitution. Following this President Mwai Kibaki dismissed his entire cabinet. The response of the ODM was to say that this was a step in the right direction and to call for an immediate general election, claiming that the Kibaki regime, which had campaigned vigorously in favour of a yes vote in the referendum, had lost its mandate. Kibaki's government resisted this; elections were not to be held until the last week of Kibaki's five-year constitutionally-mandated tenure. The ODM emerged as a major opposition party, along with KANU, and organized a number of rallies asking for elections and a new constitution. The ODM also protested against the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which opposed the referendum, being dropped from Kibaki's new cabinet.  2007 elections  ODM leader Raila Odinga speaks with the Kenyan media during the 2007‚Äì08 Kenyan crisis. After the 2002 elections, KANU was in opposition, while the LDP was a partner in the ruling NARC coalition until it was removed after the 2005 referendum. The LDP had supported no vote at the referendum, contrary to the policy of president Kibaki. Following their united stand in the referendum debate and responding to a threat by the newly formed Narc-Kenya party the leaders of KANU, LDP and some smaller parties decided to campaign jointly for the upcoming 2007 Kenya general election. They forming the Orange Democratic Movement, which was named after the symbol used to represent \\"no\\" in the referendum ‚Äì an orange. An opportunist lawyer, Mugambi Imanyara, registered the name \\"Orange Democratic Movement\\" as a party before the coalition did, forcing them to use the name \\"Orange Democratic Movement- Kenya\\" instead.\\"Orange team up in arms over party‚Äôs registration\\" The East African Standard, 29 December 2005 As 2007 progressed the coalition proved unstable, with various factions defecting. Uhuru Kenyatta's KANU was the first, pulling out in July 2007 and endorsing President Kibaki's re-election, although some individual KANU politicians stayed with the ODM. Then, due to an internal rivalry between Kalonzo Musyoka and Raila Odinga, the ODM split into two factions in mid-August 2007.\\"Opposition in Kenya splits in two\\" , BBC News, 15 August 2007\\"Final fallout\\", The East African Standard, 15 August 2007 Raila's group, which also included Musalia Mudavadi, William Ruto, Joseph Nyagah and Najib Balala defected from ODM-Kenya and took over the ODM party registered by Mugambi Imanyara, while Kalonzo's group, led by himself and Dr. Julia Ojiambo remained in the original ODM-Kenya. The two factions held their elections for presidential candidates on consecutive days at the Kasarani sports complex in Nairobi. On 31August 2007, Kalonzo Musyoka defeated Julia Ojiambo for the ODM‚ÄìKenya ticket, then on 1September Raila Odinga defeated Ruto, Mudavadi, Balala and Nyagah. There were allegations that some delegates voted in the nominations of both parties. = General election = ODM supporters at a political rally at Uhuru Park, 2007 Raila and Kalonzo then faced president Kibaki in the general election. The International Republican Institute described election day as \\"generally calm, organized, and transparent\\". Kibaki was declared winner of the elections in circumstances that were described as \\"highly questionable\\" by various observers. Samuel Kivuitu, chairman of the now disbanded Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) could not explain why votes from nearby constituencies had not reached the tallying centre in Nairobi while those from far-flung parts of the country were tallied on time. Many polling stations had more votes cast than the number of registered voters. Maragua constituency, a PNU stronghold, turnout was 115%. The ODM disputed the results. Violence erupted in the country with ODM supporters in Kibera, Naivasha and Nakuru being targeted for attack by Mungiki-supporting gangs, allegedly backed by police. PNU supporters were also targeted for attack by ODM supporters. People from the Luo ethnic group were shot dead in Kisumu, Kibera and Nakuru in large numbers while many ethnic Kikuyu were killed in the Rift Valley. The ODM won the largest number of seats with 99 in the 210 seat parliament. It also won three out of five by-elections in early 2008. No sooner had the by-elections been conducted in the constituencies of two ODM MPs who were killed at the beginning of the year than two more MPs died in an aircraft crash. Some ODM MPs whose elections were contested in court lost their seats. Political Parties Act and party elections ODM election poster Following the passing of the Political Parties Act months earlier, the ODM held its internal elections in late December 2008 with Prime Minister Raila Odinga emerging as party leader and Industrialisation Minister Henry Kosgey as party chairman. Due to agitation over regional and gender representation, some party posts had to be created on the day of the vote. Raila has since fallen out with William Ruto, Ababu Namwamba, Najib Balala, and Henry Kosgey among others. 2013 general election In the lead up to the 2013 general elections the ODM entered a coalition with FORD-Kenya and the Wiper Democratic Movement to support a single presidential candidate, known as the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy References External links *ODM leader's personal site *ODM Official website *ODM Official Community Portal *ODM 2007 Manifesto *ODM 2007 Parliamentary Candidates 2005 establishments in Kenya Civic nationalism Liberal International Liberal parties in Kenya Political parties established in 2005 Political parties in Kenya Social democratic parties in Africa Social liberal parties ","title":"Orange Democratic Movement"},{"id":"4026636","text":"VideoDance Festival started in 2000 in Athens and Thessaloniki as an international dance film festival, but soon it widened up to include more kinds of experiment on movement and the moving image. The festival has counted 7 editions from 2000 to 2007 (not held in 2006).  About VideoDance Festival  VideoDance was a festival presenting the latest experiments on media and movement or, in other words, at the crossroads of visual arts, enhanced cinema and performing arts. The screenings, the main festival axis, present a showcase of films from all over the world presented in thematic programmes. Non-narrative experimental films are being screened along with movement-based films. As far as it concerns dance films, programming is focused on the special relationship between movement and the moving image, both when it is produced as a result of a choreography for the camera, and when it is produced by the filmmaker's look on the movement. Special screenings present archival material on the history of movement and the moving image as it is preserved on film during the 20th century. Retrospectives like those on the works by Maya Deren (2003), Shirley Clarke (2004), or Ed Emshwiller give the Greek audience an opportunity to contact the first attempts of the experimental non-narrative cinema to use the movement as its main source. The live media events zone includes video-performances, performances, live improvisation with sound and image, and other experimental art works involving media and performing arts. During the festival video-installations related to the film programme themes are exhibited. The festival takes place in Athens, and the film programme is screened in Thessaloniki right after that.  More about VideoDance Festival  Video Dance was funded and produced since 2000 by the International Thessaloniki Film Festival, one of the major film institutions in Greece, part of the Greek Ministry of Culture. It was founded and curated by its artistic director, Christiana Galanopoulou. The festival was non competitive and non- commercial. However, it supported and encouraged the production of dance films in Greece, through a funding scheme, project|exchangehttp://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&page;=681. 12 Greek dance films have been co-produced by VideoDance through this scheme. The festival collaborated with several international dance film and film festivals, archives and cultural institutions and was a founding member of the Dance and Media Festivals International Network. The festival was held in industrial spaces especially re-designed for VideoDance by young architects. The last edition, VideoDance2007, was held in Athens and Thessaloniki in May 2007.

Bismil was hanged on 19 December 1927 by the British for his revolutionary activities. As well as being a freedom fighter, he was a patriotic poet and wrote in Hindi and Urdu using the pen names Ram, Agyat and Bismil. But, he became popular with the last name \\"Bismil\\" only. He was associated with Arya Samaj where he got inspiration from Satyarth Prakash, a book written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati. He also had a confidential connection with Lala Har Dayal through his guru Swami Somdev, a preacher of Arya Samaj. Bismil was one of the founding members of the revolutionary organisation Hindustan Republican Association. Bhagat Singh praised him as a great poet-writer of Urdu and Hindi, who had also translated the books Catherine from English and Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot from Bengali. Early life Ram Prasad Bismil was born on 11 June 1897 at Shahjahanpur,in Hindu Rajput family, in North-Western Provinces, British India. He learned Hindi from his father at home and was sent to learn Urdu from a moulvi. He was admitted to an English-language school, despite his father's disapproval, and also joined the Arya Samaj in Shahjahanpur. Bismil showed a talent for writing patriotic poetry. =Contact with Somdev= As an 18-year-old student, Bismil read of the death sentence passed on Bhai Parmanand, a scholar and companion of Har Dayal. At that time he was regularly attending the Arya Samaj Temple at Shahjahanpur daily, where Swami Somdev, a friend of Paramanand, was staying. Angered by the sentence, Bismil composed a poem in Hindi titled Mera Janm (en: My Birth), which he showed to Somdev. This poem demonstrated a commitment to remove the British control over India. =Lucknow Congress= Bismil left school in the following year and travelled to Lucknow with some friends. The Naram Dal (of the Indian National Congress) was not prepared to allow the Garam Dal to stage a grand welcome of Tilak in the city. They organised a group of youths and decided to publish a book in Hindi on the history of American independence, America Ki Swatantrata Ka Itihas, with the consent of Somdev. This book was published under the authorship of the fictitious Babu Harivans Sahai and its publisher's name was given as Somdev Siddhgopal Shukla. As soon as the book was published, the government of Uttar Pradesh proscribed its circulation within the state. Mainpuri conspiracy Bismil formed a revolutionary organisation called Matrivedi (Altar of Motherland) and contacted Genda Lal Dixit, a school teacher at Auraiya. Somdev arranged this, knowing that Bismil could be more effective in his mission if he had experienced people to support him. Dixit had contacts with some powerful dacoits of the state. Dixit wanted to utilise their power in the armed struggle against the British rulers. Like Bismil, Dixit had also formed an armed organisation of youths called Shivaji Samiti (named after Shivaji Maharaj). The pair organised youths from the Etawah, Mainpuri, Agra and Shahjahanpur districts of United Province (now Uttar Pradesh) to strengthen their organisations. On 28 January 1918, Bismil published a pamphlet titled Deshvasiyon Ke Nam Sandesh (A Message to Countrymen), which he distributed along with his poem Mainpuri Ki Pratigya (Vow of Mainpuri). To collect funds for the party looting was undertaken on three occasions in 1918. Police searched for them in and around Mainpuri while they were selling books proscribed by the U.P. Government in the Delhi Congress of 1918. When police found them, Bismil absconded with the books unsold. When he was planning another looting between Delhi and Agra, a police team arrived and firing started from both the sides. Bismil jumped into the Yamuna and swam underwater. The police and his companions thought that he had died in the encounter. Dixit was arrested along with his other companions and was kept in Agra fort. From here, he fled to Delhi and lived in hiding. A criminal case was filed against them. The incident is known as the \\"Mainpuri Conspiracy\\". On 1 November 1919 the Judiciary Magistrate of Mainpuri B. S. Chris announced the judgement against all accused and declared Dixit and Bismil as absconders. Underground activities From 1919 to 1920 Bismil remained inconspicuous, moving around various villages in Uttar Pradesh and producing several books. Among these was a collection of poems written by him and others, entitled Man Ki Lahar, while he also translated two works from Bengali (Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot and Yogik Sadhan) and fabricated Catherine or Swadhinta Ki Devi from an English text. He got all these books published through his own resources under Sushilmala ‚Äì a series of publications except one Yogik Sadhan which was given to a publisher who absconded and could not be traced. These books have since been found. Another of Bismil's books, Kranti Geetanjali, was published in 1929 after his death and was proscribed by British Raj in 1931. Formation of Hindustan Republican Association In February 1920, when all the prisoners in the Mainpuri conspiracy case were freed, Bismil returned home to Shahjahanpur, where he agreed with the official authorities that he would not participate in revolutionary activities. This statement of Ram Prasad was also recorded in vernacular before the court. In 1921, Bismil was among the many people from Shahjahanpur who attended the Ahmedabad Congress. He had a seat on the dias, along with the senior congressman Prem Krishna Khanna, and the revolutionary Ashfaqulla Khan. Bismil played an active role in the Congress with Maulana Hasrat Mohani and got the most debated proposal of Poorna Swaraj passed in the General Body meeting of Congress. Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was not in the favour of this proposal became quite helpless before the overwhelming demand of youths. He returned to Shahjahanpur and mobilised the youths of United Province for non-co-operation with the Government. The people of U.P. were so much influenced by the furious speeches and verses of Bismil that they became hostile against British Raj. As per statement of Banarsi Lal (approver) made in the court ‚Äì \\"Ram Prasad used to say that independence would not be achieved by means of non-violence.\\" In February 1922 some agitating farmers were killed in Chauri Chaura by the police. The police station of Chauri Chaura was attacked by the people and 22 policemen were burnt alive. Gandhi, without ascertaining the facts behind this incident, declared an immediate stop the non-co-operation movement without consulting any executive committee member of the Congress. Bismil and his group of youths strongly opposed Gandhi in the Gaya session of Indian National Congress (1922). When Gandhi refused to rescind his decision, its then- president Chittranjan Das resigned. In January 1923, the rich group of party formed a new Swaraj Party under the joint leadership of Moti Lal Nehru and Chittranjan Das, and the youth group formed a revolutionary party under the leadership of Bismil. Yellow Paper constitution With the consent of Lala Har Dayal, Bismil went to Allahabad where he drafted the constitution of the party in 1923 with the help of Sachindra Nath Sanyal and another revolutionary of Bengal, Dr. Jadugopal Mukherjee. The basic name and aims of the organisation were typed on a Yellow Paper and later on a subsequent Constitutional Committee Meeting was conducted on 3 October 1924 at Cawnpore in U.P. under the Chairmanship of Sachindra Nath Sanyal. This meeting decided the name of the party would be the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA). After a long discussion from others Bismil was declared there the District Organiser of Shahjahanpur and Chief of Arms Division. An additional responsibility of Provincial Organiser of United Province (Agra and Oudh) was also entrusted to him. Sachindra Nath Sanyal, was unanimously nominated as National Organiser and another senior member Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, was given the responsibility of Coordinator, Anushilan Samiti. After attending the meeting in Kanpur, both Sanyal and Chatterjee left the U.P. and proceeded to Bengal for further extension of the organisation. Manifesto of H.R.A. A pamphlet entitled as The Revolutionary was distributed throughout the United Province in India about the end of January 1925. Copies of this leaflet, referred to in the evidence as the \\"White Leaflet\\", were also found with some other alleged conspirators of Kakori Conspiracy as per judgement of the Chief Court of Oudh. A typed copy of this manifesto was found with Manmath Nath Gupta. It was nothing but the Manifesto of H.R.A. in the form of a four paged printed pamphlet on white paper which was circulated secretly by post and by hands in most of the districts of United Province and other parts of India. This pamphlet bore no name of the printing press. The heading of the pamphlet was: \\"The Revolutionary\\" (An Organ of the Revolutionary Party of India). It was given 1st number and 1st issue of the publication. The date of its publication was given as 1 January 1925. Kakori conspiracy Bismil executed a meticulous plan for looting the government treasury carried in a train at Kakori, near Lucknow in U.P. This historical event happened on 9 August 1925 and is known as the Kakori conspiracy. Ten revolutionaries stopped the 8 Down Saharanpur-Lucknow passenger train at Kakori ‚Äì a station just before the Lucknow Railway Junction. German-made Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistols were used in this action. Ashfaqulla Khan, the lieutenant of the HRA Chief Ram Prasad Bismil gave away his Mauser to Manmath Nath Gupta and engaged himself to break open the cash chest. Eagerly watching a new weapon in his hand, Manmath Nath Gupta fired the pistol and accidentally shot and killed passenger Ahmed Ali, who had gotten down from the train to see his wife in the ladies compartment. More than 40 revolutionaries were arrested whereas only 10 persons had taken part in the decoity. Persons completely unrelated to the incident were also captured. However some of them were let off. The government-appointed Jagat Narain Mulla as public prosecutor at an incredible fee. Dr. Harkaran Nath Mishra (Barrister M.L.A.) and Dr. Mohan Lal Saxena (M.L.C.) were appointed as defence counsel. The defence committee was also formed to defend the accused. Govind Ballabh Pant, Chandra Bhanu Gupta and Kripa Shankar Hajela defended their case. The men were found guilty and subsequent appeals failed. On 16 September 1927, a final appeal for clemency was forwarded to the Privy Council in London but that also failed. Following 18 months of legal process, Bismil, Ashfaqulla Khan, Roshan Singh and Rajendra Nath Lahiri were sentenced to death. Bismil was hanged on 19 December 1927 at Gorakhpur Jail, Ashfaqulla Khan at the Faizabad Jail and Roshan Singh at Naini Allahabad Jail. Lahiri had been hanged two days earlier at Gonda Jail. Bismil's body was taken to the Rapti river for a Hindu cremation, and the site became known as Rajghat. Literary works Bismil published a pamphlet titled Deshvasiyon ke nam sandesh (en: A message to my countrymen). While living underground, he translated some of Bengali books viz. Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot (en: The Bolshevik's programme) and Yogik Sadhan (of Arvind Ghosh). Beside these a collection of poems Man Ki Lahar (en: A sally of mind) and Swadeshi Rang was also written by him. Another Swadhinta ki devi: Catherine was fabricated from an English book into Hindi. All of these were published by him in Sushil Mala series. Bismil wrote his autobiography while he was kept as condemned prisoner in Gorakhpur jail. The autobiography of Ram Prasad Bismil was published under the cover title of Kakori ke shaheed by Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi in 1928 from Pratap Press, Cawnpore. A rough translation of this book was got prepared by the Criminal Investigation Department of United Province in British India. Translated book was circulated as confidential document for official and police use throughout the country. He immortalised the poem Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna as a war cry during the British Raj period in India. It was first published in journal \\"Sabah\\", published from Delhi. Memorials Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan (Park) in Greater Noida Shaheed Smarak Samiti of Shahjahanpur established a memorial at Khirni Bagh mohalla of Shahjahanpur city where Bismil was born in 1897 and named it \\"Amar Shaheed Ram Prasad Bismil Smarak\\". A statue made of white marble was inaugurated by the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh Motilal Vora on 18 December 1994 on the eve of the martyr's 69th death anniversary. The Northern railway zone of Indian Railways built the Pt Ram Prasad Bismil railway station, from Shahajahanpur. There is a memorial to the Kakori conspiracists at Kakori itself. It was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, on 19 December 1983. The Government of India issued a multicoloured commemorative postal stamp on 19 December 1997 in Bismil's birth centenary year. The government of Uttar Pradesh had named a park after him: Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan is near Rampur Jagir village, where Bismil lived underground after the Mainpuri conspiracy case in 1919.

In the US broadcast digital TV system, an ATSC receiver then decodes the TS and displays it on a TV. An ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) tuner, often called an ATSC receiver or HDTV tuner, is a type of television tuner that allows reception of digital television (DTV) television channels that use ATSC standards, as transmitted by television stations in North America, parts of Central America, and South Korea. Such tuners are usually integrated into a television set, VCR, digital video recorder (DVR), or set-top box which provides audio/video output connectors of various types. Another type of television tuner is a digital television adapter (DTA) with an analog passthrough. Technical overview The terms \\"tuner\\" and \\"receiver\\" are used loosely, and it is perhaps more appropriately called an ATSC receiver, with the tuner being part of the receiver (see Metonymy). The receiver generates the audio and video (AV) signals needed for television, and performs the following tasks: demodulation; error correction; MPEG transport stream demultiplexing; decompression; AV synchronization; and media reformatting to match what is optimal input for one's TV. Examples of media reformatting include: interlace to progressive scan or vice versa; picture resolutions; aspect ratio conversions (16:9 to or from 4:3); frame rate conversion; and image scaling. Zooming is an example of resolution change. It is commonly used to convert a low-resolution picture to a high-resolution display. This lets the user eliminate letterboxing or pillarboxing by stretching or cropping the picture. Some ATSC receivers, mostly those in HDTV TV sets, will stretch automatically, either by detecting black bars or by reading the Active Format Descriptor (AFD). How an ATSC tuner works An ATSC tuner works by generating audio and video signals that are picked up from over-the-air broadcast television. ATSC tuners provide the following functions: selective tuning; demodulation; transport stream demultiplexing; decompression; error correction; analog-to-digital conversion; AV synchronization; and media reformatting to fit the specific type of TV screen optimally. = Selective tuning = Selective tuning is the process by which the radio frequency (RF) of the television channel is selected by a receiver from within a band of transmitted RF signals. The tuner usually performs the function of frequency- agile selection, along with rejection of unwanted out-of-band signals. = Demodulation = \`Demodulation\` means transforming the signal from the tuner into a signal that a TV set can use to produce images and sound without further consideration for the frequency at which it was transmitted. It is separation of a standard baseband signal from the RF carrier that was used to transmit it through the air (or down a coaxial cable or other long-distance medium.) ATSC as implemented in the US uses 8VSB modulation, which requires less power to transmit, as opposed to the also proposed COFDM modulation (used in European DVB-T, which is less prone to multipath distortion and therefore better received in mobile installations). = Transport stream = In the US, multiple digital signals are combined and then transmitted from one antenna source to create over the air broadcasts. By the reverse process (demultiplexing), an ATSC receiver first receives the combined MPEG transport stream and then decodes it to display one of its component signals on a TV set. = Decompression = Since digital signals that are broadcast over the air are compressed (packed smaller), once they are received by the ATSC tuner, these compressed packets of digital data are then decompressed (unpacked to their original size). The ATSC system uses lossy compression, so while the decompressed data size is the same as the original compressed data size, the data produced is not exactly the same as the original data fed into the system at the transmitting site, but it is close enough that most people will not notice a difference. = Error correction = Error correction is a technology that is used by the ATSC tuner to make sure that any data that is missing can be corrected. For instance, sometimes interference or a poor-quality signal will cause the loss of some data that the ATSC tuner receives. With error correction, the tuner has the ability to perform a number of checks and repair data so that a signal can be viewed on a TV set. Error correction works by adding some extra information to the signal before transmission that can be used upon reception to fill in gaps. Therefore, error correction has the opposite effect of compression‚Äîit increases the amount of data to transmit, rather than reducing it like compression does, and it improves the quality and robustness of the signal rather than reducing it. Compression removes redundant (and some non-redundant) data, while error correction adds some redundant data. The reason for using error correction rather than just using less compression and keeping the redundancy that was already there is that error correction systems are specially designed to get the maximum benefit out of a very small amount of redundant data, whereas the natural redundancy of the data doesn't do this job as efficiently, so with error correction the net amount of data needed is still smaller. * The ATSC standard (ATSC-E) has a subsection that allows broadcasters to add extra (and variable types) of error correction to their broadcast streams. * This error correction service is not mandatory in the US, nor is it mandatory in Canada. * It is not known how many HDTV receivers support this error correction standard. * For the transmission of HDTV at 720 or 1080, an extra 1% to 3% added error correction codes will help reduce some of ATSC's poorer performance with weak signals under adverse multipath conditions. * Reception is greatly reduced due to EMI in the shortwave to VHF and UHF bandwidth from nearby computers of all sorts [light], portable WiFi and Broadband internet [medium to strong], microwave ovens [burst while activated], cell phones and the towers they communicate with, and even power lines with electronic transmissions. = AV synchronization = AV synchronization is the coordination of audio and video signals being displayed on a digital TV in proper time. AV synchronization ensures that the audio does not lag behind the video that is being displayed on the TV set or vice versa, so that both audio and video are in sync. = Image reformatting = Media reformatting is extremely important because the formatting of images on TV sets differs significantly according to the technology employed. For instance, some televisions have an interlaced picture, whereas others have a progressive-scan picture. Different televisions have a different aspect ratio. United States government mandates The FCC has issued the following mandates for devices entering the US: *By July 1, 2005 all televisions with screen sizes over must include a built-in ATSC DTV tuner. *By March 1, 2006 all televisions with screen sizes over must include a built-in ATSC DTV tuner. *By March 1, 2007 all televisions regardless of screen size, and all interface devices that include a tuner (VCR, DVD player/recorder, DVR) must include a built-in ATSC DTV tuner. Devices manufactured before these dates can still be sold without a built-in ATSC DTV tuner; the lack of digital tuners legally must be disclosed to consumers and most name-brand retailers have incurred onerous FCC penalties for non-compliance with these requirements.FCC, April 10, 2008: FCC adopts DTV enforcement orders totaling over $6 million The current regulations are specified in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). =Analog TV broadcast switch-off= In early 2006 the US Deficit Reduction Act of 2005Pub. L. No. 109-171, 120 Stat. 4 (February 8, 2006). became law, which calls for full-power over-the-air television stations to cease their analog broadcasts by February 17, 2009 Section 3002 of the Act amends 47 U.S.C. section 309(j)(14) to provide for the February 17, 2009, deadline. (this cut-off date had been moved several times previously). On February 11, 2009, the mandatory DTV broadcast date was moved again to June 12, 2009, although stations were allowed to switch earlier. The delay enabled distribution of more coupons for purchase of converter boxes.Congress Delays Troubled Switch To Digital TV As of June 12, 2009, TVs and other equipment with legacy NTSC tuners are unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts from United States TV stations, unless the broadcast is from a repeater or low- power transmitter. Canada had a similar analogue TV termination date set to September 1, 2011 (except in some remote northern regions). It was feared that the US switch-off would cause millions of non-cable- and non-satellite- connected TV sets to \\"go dark\\". Viewers who did not upgrade, either to a television with a digital tuner or a set-top box, ended up losing their only source of television, unless they relied only upon the aforementioned non- full-power broadcasters. A Congressional bill authorized subsidized converter boxes in a way that allowed viewers to receive the new digital broadcasts on their old TVs. The transition proceeded with about 235,000 people requesting coupons after the June 12, 2009, transition date. Two $40 coupons were made available per US address nominally from January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2009; each coupon could be used toward the purchase of one approved coupon- eligible converter box. The coupons expired 90 days after initial mailing and were not renewable. All households were eligible to receive coupons from the initial $990 million allocated, after which an additional $510 million in coupons was to be available to households that rely exclusively on over-the- air television reception. On January 4, 2009, the coupon program reached its US$1.34 billion ceiling and any further consumer requests were placed on a waiting list. Canadian government mandates In Canada, the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) had set August 31, 2011, as the date on which over-the-air analog TV transmission service would cease in 31 major markets of the country, including all provincial capitals, plus Ottawa (the national capital), and most other major urban centers. As of the end of 2008, there were 22 Canadian DTV transmitters on-air and all existing digital transitional television licenses explicitly proscribe, as a condition of license, the broadcast of more than fourteen hours a week of programming not already on the analogue service. Unlike in the United States, there is no plan to subsidise ATSC converter purchases and no requirement that newly imported receivers decode the digital signal. Canadian retailers are also not required to disclose the inability of new equipment to receive DTV. The Canadian market therefore has been flooded with obsolete new NTSC equipment which lawfully cannot be exported to the US. A limited number of ATSC receivers are in Canadian retail stores as high-definition television (HDTV) receivers. ATSC CECB converter boxes were first carried nationally in October 2008, with chains such as Best Buy and Home Hardware offering limited selection at higher prices than in the US with no government subsidies. ATSC tuners may also be present in most recently manufactured televisions, as well as DVD recorders, HDTV FTA receivers, and personal computer TV tuner cards. As of the beginning of 2012, almost all Canadian broadcasters are broadcasting an ATSC signal, with a handful of exceptions granted for low-power and regional stations. These signals can be reliably tuned in most cities with a good indoor antenna and an ATSC tuner. US-based ATSC signals can be reliably tuned with an outdoor antenna and an ATSC tuner in Canadian markets within 60 miles of the US broadcast towers. These markets include Toronto (from Buffalo), Windsor (from Detroit and Toledo), Vancouver (from Seattle and Tacoma), Montreal (from Burlington and Plattsburgh), Ottawa (from Watertown and Plattsburgh), and Fredericton (from Presque Isle). Indoor antennas (both passive and amplified) are easier to install, but outdoor antennas are better at tuning stations from further distances. Setup and operation Most ATSC tuners have relatively simple on-screen menus, and automatically bring the user to a setup screen when turned on for the first time. This allows the user to pick the time zone and daylight-saving time mode (as all stations transmit time in UTC), and bandscan for stations. The scan \\"listens\\" on every channel from 2 to 69, and pauses when it detects a digital carrier wave. If it is able to decode the station, it reads its PSIP data, and adds its virtual channels to the channel map. If no PSIP is transmitted, the physical channel number is used, and each transport stream is enumerated according to its TSID (converted from hexadecimal), or starting sequentially at .1, .2, .3, and so forth, depending on the tuner. Several TV stations are using or have used a temporary channel to send their DTV signals and, upon terminating analog transmission, move their digital transmission either back to their old analog channel, or to a third channel (sometimes the former analog of another local station), chosen in the digital channel election in the U.S. This requires all viewers to re- scan or manually add the new channel and possibly delete the old one. Doing a full re-scan will usually cause other channels to be dropped if they cannot be received at the moment the scan passes their physical channel, so this is typically undesirable, although many ATSC tuners only have this option. Some have an \\"easy-add\\" feature which does not delete what is already mapped in memory. Some allow the user to enter the physical channel and an unmapped subchannel, causing the tuner to search the physical channel. Depending on the tuner, this may or may not automatically add the station and its digital subchannels to the map, and/or to the user's \\"favorites\\". This may also leave the old \\"dead\\" channel mapping in place, so that there is the new 8.1, dead 8.1, new 8.2, dead 8.2, etc. In most cases, TV stations will not have the actual frequency they are currently using on their website. If the auto scan does not pick up the signal and the tuner has manual frequency scan capability try to get the actual frequency from the station engineer. This may allow one to stay on one frequency (channel) versus \\"scanning\\" (moving too quickly through) and allow one to make antenna adjustments while observing only a problematic channel. Other errors which appear to be in the tuner are actually the result of incorrect data sent by one or more stations, often including missing electronic program guide data. Many ATSC tuners will remember EPG info for each station, but only for a few hours after viewing a channel on that station. Some will not remember at all (displaying only the required channel banner), while a very few others will store data for days (although this requires staying tuned to each station for more than a few seconds in order to receive the extended info). DirecTV receivers with ATSC tuners can download the guide at any time, while other TiVo units download guide data separately. TV Guide On Screen can also be used for this, but very few if any ATSC tuners include this (which requires downloading all guide data for all channels from one particular station). Stations sending the wrong time are also a major problem, as this can skew or ruin guide data for all stations until the correct time is received again from a different and correctly set station. Manual tuning Each digital OTA channel number is composed of a main number and a subchannel, for example 4.1, 4.2, etc. A dash is an alternate form of representation: 4‚Äì1, 4‚Äì2... The dot and dash are interchangeable; they both mean the same thing. The main channel numbers refer to the same radio frequencies as previously. However, now \\"virtual channel\\" (technically known as logical channel number) numbers are common. So, Channel 4 digital signals may now actually be broadcast on channel 43, or any other frequency. When the ATSC tuner does a channel scan, it finds the signal on channel 43, learns that this material is called \\"Channel 4\\", and remembers that mapping. The user can tune to \\"4\\", and the tuner will know to tune in 43. Before a scan is done, it may be possible to access the programs directly by manual tuning, by entering 43‚Äì1, 43‚Äì2... After the scan, the programs would usually be accessed by entering 4‚Äì1, 4-2 etc., but it may still be possible to also access them directly at 43 as long as it is also not the same as an already assigned channel. If stations change their broadcast frequencies, it may be possible to access the new frequencies directly as long as it is also not the same as an already assigned channel in which case it will go to that channel instead of the frequency, but the usual procedure is to re-scan all of the channels which will just assign multiple version of any overlapping channels.

The highway extends from CR 629/Ocean Drive (Ventnor Avenue) in Margate City, Atlantic County north to Route 72 in Woodland Township, Burlington County. In Atlantic County, the road runs through a mix of suburban and rural areas, passing through Northfield, Egg Harbor Township, and Egg Harbor City. North of Egg Harbor City into Burlington County, CR 563 runs through the heavily forested Pine Barrens. Between Margate and Northfield, CR 563 runs along the Downbeach Express, a toll bridge that is maintained by Ole Hansen & Sons, Inc. The Margate Bridge was built in 1929 by Ole Hansen and privately maintained until being taken over by the Margate Bridge Company in 1963. It was renamed to the Downbeach Express in 2012. The portion of present-day CR 563 between U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and US 30 was legislated as a state highway called Route S43 in 1938, a spur of Route 43 (US 30). This was never built as a state highway. By 1946, all of current CR 563 had been built as a paved road. The CR 563 designation was assigned in 1952 with the creation of the 500-series county routes in New Jersey. The Cardiff Circle at the north end of the US 40/US 322 concurrency in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in 2002, while the Airport Circle at CR 646 near the Atlantic City International Airport underwent alterations in 2011 allowing Delilah Road motorists to pass straight through the circle, and future plans call for new ramps to pass over the circle as part of a project to connect the airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway. Route description CR 563 northbound past US 40/US 322 in Egg Harbor Township CR 563 begins at an intersection with CR 629 (Ocean Drive) in Margate City, Atlantic County, heading to the northwest on Jerome Avenue, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road continues through residential areas of Margate City before it comes to the toll plaza for the Downbeach Express, formerly known as the Margate Bridge and Causeway. This span, which stretches from Margate City to Northfield, is maintained by Ole Hansen & Sons, Inc., and tolls can be paid with cash or the Downbeach Express Pass, an automated toll collection system. E-ZPass is not accepted on the Downbeach Express. The toll for cars is $1.75 using cash and $1.30 using the Downbeach Express Pass. At this point, CR 563 narrows into a two-lane undivided road and turns west, entering Egg Harbor Township upon crossing the Beach Thorofare on a drawbridge. The road turns northwest into wetlands, crossing over several waterways. After passing a marina, the route runs through more wetlands before entering Northfield. Here, CR 563 becomes Mill Road and passes homes prior to a five-way intersection with CR 585 and CR 662. At this intersection, CR 563 turns north onto Tilton Road and runs through residential and commercial areas. Upon crossing US 9, the route widens back to a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and is lined with several businesses. The road crosses back into Egg Harbor Township, becoming a six- lane divided highway as it crosses CR 651 and has a ramp from the southbound direction to the Garden State Parkway. CR 563 becomes a four-lane undivided road as it crosses under the Garden State Parkway and comes to a ramp from the southbound Garden State Parkway to southbound CR 563. A short distance later, it comes to an intersection with US 40/US 322 (Black Horse Pike), where CR 563 makes a left turn to form a concurrency with that road. Along the Black Horse Pike, the road continues north and passes to the east of the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from US 40/US 322 by continuing north-northwest on Tilton Road, which is three lanes wide including a center left-turn lane. It runs through wooded areas of development as it crosses over the Atlantic City Expressway without an interchange. CR 563 intersects CR 646 and Amelia Earhart Boulevard, an access road to the Atlantic City International Airport at the former Airport Circle. Following the circle, the route narrows into a two-lane road as it passes through forests prior to running to the west of the Atlantic City International Airport. The road continues into Hamilton Township, where it has an intersection with CR 575. After this intersection, CR 563 enters wooded surroundings and crosses into Galloway Township. In this area, the road crosses over NJ Transit‚Äôs Atlantic City Line prior to an intersection with US 30 (White Horse Pike). View north along CR 563 at CR 679 in Washington Township, Burlington County CR 563 heads northwest to form a concurrency with the four-lane undivided US 30, passing through the community of Cologne, where it crosses CR 614. The road continues through rural areas with some development before entering Egg Harbor City at the CR 674 junction. In Egg Harbor City, the road passes homes and businesses before coming to the northern terminus of Route 50 in the center of town. At this intersection, CR 563 splits from US 30 by heading northeast on two-lane undivided Philadelphia Avenue, which continues south as Route 50. The road passes through the downtown area before entering areas of homes. After crossing CR 561, the development along CR 563 decreases as it heads into heavily forested areas of the Pine Barrens and comes to a crossroads with CR 561 Alternate. Upon crossing Egg Harbor City Lake, CR 563 becomes Park Avenue West, Buffalo Avenue, and Egg Harbor-Green Bank Road. The road makes a turn to the north and crosses into Mullica Township. In Mullica Township, the route enters the residential community of Weekstown, where it curves west before heading north at the CR 643 junction. Upon leaving Weekstown, CR 563 turns northeast back into the Pine Barrens. Northern terminus of CR 563 at Route 72 After crossing the Mullica River on a drawbridge, CR 563 enters Washington Township in Burlington County, where it becomes Chatsworth-Harrisville-New Gretna Road and continues northeast past homes. After heading east for a brief concurrency with CR 542, the route heads north into the Wharton State Forest, passing through rural areas for several miles. CR 563 intersects CR 679 before passing a few areas of homes. The road runs through more forests before heading into an area of cranberry bogs. CR 563 leaves the Wharton State Forest and enters Woodland Township, still in the Pine Barrens. In Woodland Township, the route comes to the residential community of Chatsworth. In the center of the community, CR 563 has a concurrency with CR 532. After running through Chatsworth, CR 563 passes through more forests before coming to its northern terminus at Route 72. History alt=Cutout shield for Route S43What is now CR 563 between Egg Harbor City and Green Bank originally existed as an unnumbered and unpaved road by 1927. The Margate Bridge between Margate City and Northfield was built in 1929 by Ole Hansen and was privately maintained by F. W. Schwiers & Company. This span would be purchased in 1963 by the Margate Bridge Company, owned by the Hansen and Capaldi families, after the original owners went bankrupt. In 1938, a spur of Route 43 (US 30) called Route S43 was planned to follow the current alignment of CR 563 from Route 43 in Germania to Route 4 (now US 9) in Northfield; this road was never built as a state highway. By 1946, the entire current alignment of CR 563 was built as an unnumbered paved two-lane road. When the 500-series county routes were established in New Jersey in 1952, CR 563 was designated onto its current alignment. A spur route, CR 563 Spur, was also designated, which ran from CR 563 in Washington Township east to US 9 in New Gretna in Burlington County. This spur route was replaced with CR 679 by the 1990s. The Cardiff Circle at the north end of the US 40/US 322 concurrency in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002. The Airport Circle at CR 646 was planned to be replaced with a regular roundabout due to a high accident rate at the current circle. The circle was removed in 2011, allowing CR 646 motorists to pass across through the circle, and future plans call for new ramps to pass over the circle as part of a project to connect the airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway. In 2003, an automated toll collection system was introduced along the Margate Bridge and Causeway known as the Quick Toll Card, which used a prepaid automated toll card. In 2012, the Margate Bridge and Causeway was renamed the Downbeach Express and a more efficient Downbeach Express Pass automated toll collection system was introduced.

In the 1950s, App often wrote articles for Conde McGinley's antisemitic journal Common Sense. In 1973 App laid out eight \\"axioms\\", or what he described as \\"incontrovertible assertions\\" about the Holocaust in his 1973 pamphlet The Six Million Swindle: # Emigration, not extermination, was the Nazi Germany's plan for dealing with its \\"Jewish problem\\". # No Jews were gassed in any German concentration camps (including Auschwitz). # Jews who disappeared during the years of World War II and have not been accounted for did so in territories under Soviet, rather than German, control. # The majority of Jews who were killed by the Nazis were people whom the Nazis had every right to execute as subversives, spies, and criminals. # If the Holocaust claims had any truth, Israel would have opened its archives to historians. # All evidence to support the figure of six million dead rests upon misquotes of Nazis and Nazi documents. # It is incumbent upon the accusers to prove the six million figure. # Jewish historians and other scholars have great discrepancies in their calculations of the number of victims.

In the third quarter of 2014, Gad was ranked the #3 songwriter in America by Billboard, following up fellow hitmakers Ryan Tedder and Pharrell Williams.Profile, billboard.com; accessed 9 May 2015. Biography =Childhood and early musical experience= Born into a musical family in Munich in 1968, Gad was influenced by both parents who were established figures in the Munich music scene with their group, The Jazz Kids. His Danish father is a clarinet player and a pilot. His German mother is a psychotherapist and composer/pianist who tours the UK and Europe with Brian Carrick's jazz band, the Algiers Stompers. Gad was expected to study banjo and join the Jazz Kids, but he took to playing the piano instead. At age 7, he and his brother Jens had formed their own band, the Gad Rollers, and played original rock'n'roll compositions during intermissions of their parents' gigs. =Early career successes= Although too young to get into most clubs at age 13, Toby and Jens were no strangers to the live music scene in Munich. Weekly gigs in bars, concerts in open-air summer festivals and shows in legendary live clubs such as the Domicile spread the word, and Munich hit producer Tony Monn showed interest in the brothers. Monn handed over his state-of-the-art recording studio to Toby and Jens whenever he was out of town. Monn's generosity provided a learning environment for Toby and Jens to delve into songwriting and producing. In 1986, when Frank Farian, a multi-platinum German producer (No Mercy, Boney M, Milli Vanilli) was looking for new talent, a mutual friend turned him on to the Gad brothers' material. The next day, the boys flew to Frankfurt and thus started a seven-year collaboration with Farian. One week later, they found three of their songs on Milli Vanilli's debut album, which later went multi-platinum. Farian produced Toby and Jens' first album Q' as artists', which was followed by a live tour. Funk legend George Clinton would later hear the record and invited Toby and Jens to perform two songs on stage with his P-funk band. =Commercial breakthrough= In 1990, Toby Gad met Mauritian singer Jacqueline Nemorin. This became the beginning of a 10-year collaboration between the two. Together with Farian, Gad produced Nemorin's first album The Creole Dance on BMG. In 1994, Gad signed on with manager Klaus Frers (Daydream Music Supervizing) and produced Nemorin's second album for EMI Europe. It was also Frers who moved the duo into music production for dozens of successful TV shows, commercials and movie soundtracks. Gad and Nemorin wrote and produced the title-song for the movie Neverending Story III, the music for two popular daily TV talk-shows that stayed on air for four years, and the single \\"The Magic of the Fall\\", which went on to win the BDA Gold Award in L.A. for best TV trailer concept. In 1998, Gad was hired by Spanish producer Rafael Perez to work on Enrique Iglesias' third album. That same year, Gad signed a deal with Joost Van Os, former head of Polygram. =Move to New York City= Following much success in his home country, Gad relocated to New York City, opening Strawberrybee studio in Midtown Manhattan. The album title song and hit single \\"Unspoken\\" of Christian platinum artist Jaci Velasquez, written by Gad, Madeline Stone and O.Hatch, managed to stay half a year in the Christian Billboard top 20 single charts and was re-released on the Billboard #2 album, WOW Greatest Hits 2004. Meanwhile, Gad had several successes back overseas. \\"Damn I Think I Love You\\" stayed at #1 for seven weeks and became the most sold single of 2001 in the Netherlands. The #1 StarMaker album with two of Gad's songs went triple platinum. Sita's debut single \\"Happy\\" was at #1 for two weeks and remained in the top five for two months. The song was also released in the US on the Wild Thornberries soundtrack, followed by the #1 album of Sita. =Success in America= After 3 years in New York without any success, Gad was given the chance to work with MTV host Willa Ford. Their single \\"A Toast to Men\\" became a #40 radio single, appearing in the hit movie Barbershop 2.\\"Barbershop 2: Back in Business'\\", imdb.com; accessed 11 May 2015. Gad, with David and William Derella from DAS, worked out a co-publishing deal with Cherrylane Music Publishing and record deals for several of Gad's artists. In August 2005, Interscope Records released Texan teen Kaci Brown's album Instigator, entirely developed, produced and co-written by Gad. R&B; group Fatty Koo has an album on Columbia Records on which every song is produced and co-written by Toby. He produced and co-wrote songs on the album of the Australian twins The Veronicas, who scored the biggest US newcomer record deal of the year on Warner Bros. Records/Sire Records and went double platinum in Australia. Meleni and Gad co-wrote the song \\"Drop It On Me\\" on Ricky Martin's 2005 album Life. Another artist that Toby developed for years, Lola, released her single \\"No Strings\\" on Warner Bros. Records/Sobe, which spent 4 months on the Billboard Dance charts, peaking at #2. In 2006, Gad opened a second studio with five interns, expanding his production company Strawberrybee Music and his publishing company, Gad Songs. Gad produced the entire Blue Note Records album of Elizabeth Withers, who starred in the Broadway musical The Color Purple, and contributed a song on Fergie's platinum-selling album The Dutchess. He also collaborated with then 13-year-old Emmy nominated actress/singer Keke Palmer on her 2007 debut album on Atlantic Records and produced a song for the second season of hit Disney sitcom Hannah Montana. As an innovative producer and songwriter, Gad has been interviewed multiple times about how he writes and how he records and mixes using Logic Pro. He has been featured in Mix Magazine, the Recording Mag, Pro Sound and more. In 2008, Gad and Fergie's \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" was Grammy nominated for Best Female Vocal Performance and won ASCAP 'Song of the Year'. The song twice broke the record for most airplay on US radio and spent a total of 21 weeks in various Billboard US charts at #1, including one week #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Over 87 worldwide compilation albums feature the song. Gad scored his second worldwide #1 hit with Beyonc√©'s \\"If I Were a Boy\\", which Gad produced and co- wrote. \\"If I Were A Boy\\" reached #1 in nine countries and hit top-ten in over 20 countries around the world. Gad's third platinum number one hit was the indie-electro pop anthem \\"Untouched\\" by Aussie duo The Veronicas. The song sold platinum in the US and reached #1 in Ireland and Mexico. =Move to Los Angeles= In summer 2009, Gad relocated his recording studio to Los Angeles. The new studio, located in the Hollywood Hills, features several music production rooms and a video editing room. In Los Angeles, Gad continued collaborating with stars such as American Idol finalists Kris Allen, Allison Iraheta and Jessica Sanchez. In 2009, Gad also launched his own record label, Kite Records, which is a collaboration between himself, David Sonenberg/DAS Management, and Island Def Jam Music Group as well as Gad Films which features exclusive behind the scenes footage of Gad working in the studio with stars such as Miley Cyrus and The Veronicas. In 2011, Gad co-wrote \\"All of Me\\" for John Legend, which, after three years of dormancy made its way to #1 on the Top 100 for three weeks and was certified 8 times platinum. In 2014, Gad co- wrote 11 songs with Madonna for her album Rebel Heart, producing four of the songs. In 2015, Gad executive produced and co-wrote much of Leona Lewis' fifth studio album, I Am. He co-wrote and produced Prince Royce's \\"Lucky One\\" on Double Vision, co-wrote John Newman's \\"I'm Not Your Man\\" from Revolve, and co- wrote and produced \\"First Heartbreak\\" for Grammy-nominated artist Tori Kelly's Unbreakable Smile. Gad also produced and co-wrote the international charity single \\"Love Song to the Earth\\" which featured a long list of popular artists, including Paul McCartney, Fergie, Jon Bon Jovi, Sheryl Crow, Sean Paul, Nicole Scherzinger, and more. He also produced the 2015 album of Chloe Temtchine, Be Brave, which was described by the New York Post as \\"a moving collection of pop songs that document her struggle for survival, but also her recovery.\\"\\"Chloe Temtchine - In Time Music, Inc.,\\" tobygad.com  Single peak positions  = U.S. single peaks = The following select singles charted inside the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 or Billboard Dance Charts: * \\"If I Were a Boy\\" by Beyonc√© - #3 (2008) * \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" by Fergie - #1 (2007) * \\"All of Me\\" by John Legend - #1 (2013) * \\"Skyscraper\\" by Demi Lovato - #10 (2011) * \\"Untouched\\" by The Veronicas - #17 (2007) * \\"Don't Hold Your Breath\\" by Nicole Scherzinger -(2011) * \\"Living for Love\\" by Madonna - ' (2014) * \\"Bitch, I'm Madonna\\" by Madonna - ' (2015) * \\"Fire Under My Feet\\" by Leona Lewis - #4 (2015) * \\"Here's to Us\\" by Halestorm - #15 (2012) * \\"I Do\\" by Colbie Caillat - #23 (2011) * \\"A Year Without Rain\\" by Selena Gomez - #35 (2010) = UK single peaks = The following singles charted inside the top 40 of the UK Download or UK Singles Chart: * \\"If I Were a Boy\\" by Beyonce - #1 (2008) * \\"Don't Hold Your Breath\\" by Nicole Scherzinger - #1 (2011) * \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" by Fergie - #2 (2007) * \\"All of Me\\" by John Legend - #2 (2013) * \\"Skyscraper\\" by Sam Bailey - #1 (2013) * \\"Love You More\\" by JLS - #1 (2010) * \\"Skyscraper\\" by Demi Lovato - #17 (2011) * \\"Who You Are\\" by Jessie J - #8 (2011) * \\"Untouched\\" by The Veronicas - #8 (2007) * \\"Living for Love\\" by Madonna - #26 (2014) * \\"Up\\" by James Morrison & Jessie J - #30 (2011) * \\"Fire Under My Feet\\" by Leona Lewis - #26 (2015)  Discography  References External links Profile, discogs.com *Profile, atlasmusicgroup.com *Profile, idolator.com *Profile, complex.com Profile, ascap.com *Profile, observer.com *Speaker, ascap2012.sched.org *Atlantic Music Signs Grammy Award winner Toby Gad, broadwayworld.com *Toby Gad discography, board.thenext2shine.com *Toby Gad with new top releases, bmg.com *Toby Gad/John Legend interview, songwriteruniverse.com Living people 1968 births German songwriters German emigrants to the United States Musicians from Munich ","title":"Toby Gad"},{"id":"4026775","text":"Mark Powell may refer to: * Mark Powell (clothing designer) (born 1960), British fashion designer * Mark Powell (photographer) (born 1968), American photographer * Mark Powell (footballer) (born 1984), Australian footballer * Mark Powell (cricketer, born 1972), former English cricketer * Mark Powell (cricketer, born 1980), English cricketer for Northamptonshire, 2000‚Äì2004 * Mark Powell (novelist) (born 1976), American novelist * Mark Allan Powell (born 1953), professor of theology ","title":"Mark Powell"},{"id":"4026777","text":"left Mustad Fishing (O. Mustad & S√∏n A.S.) is a Norwegian company that manufactures and sells fishing tackle and accessories since 1877. The Mustad product range includes fish hooks, multifilament and monofilament fishing lines, fishing lures, fishing flies, fly hooks, terminal tackle and fishing apparel. The corporate headquarters are in Gj√∏vik, Norway.  Mustad Fishing Today  Mustad has expanded from their core business of manufacturing hooks and terminal tackle to a varied range of other fishing accessories. Sales offices have been established in Miami, FL (USA), Singapore and Wuxi (China), and has production facilities in Norway, China, Singapore, Portugal, and Malaysia. Mustad‚Äôs products are present in more than 160 countries. The company was run by the 6th generation Mustad until the end of 2011, when Mustad was sold to the Norwegian-based investment company, NLI Utvikling (now ARD Group AS).Mustad Hooks to be Bought by Norwegian Investment (November 28, 2011. Scout.com) In 2017, a majority of shares were then sold to Verdane Capital, another investment company. History Hans Mustad (1873-1918) Mustad can trace its roots back to 1832 in Vardal. Hans Schikkelstad (1789‚Äì1843), a farmer, established the factory \\"Brusveen Spiger- og Staltradfabrikk\\" for the production of nails, steel wire and various metal products. Later, Skikkelstad's son-in-law Ole Hovelsen Mustad (1810‚Äì84), took over the company with his son Hans Mustad (1837‚Äì1918) and changed its name to \\"O. Mustad\\" and later \\"O. Mustad & S√∏n\\". The company was headquartered in the small village of Gj√∏vik (Norway), an area with poor infrastructures where transportation was an obstacle to most type of supplies. = Growing to other markets = In spite of the negative conditions and the pessimistic visions of the Norwegian Department of Interior (\\"The difficulty in competing with foreign factories means that industry will never succeed in this country\\"Terje Paulsberg, \\"Mustad - Fish Hooks for the World\\"; Alfa Forlag AS, 2007), by 1860 Ole Mustad led his company to a primary position in the production of small metal products like fencing wire, nails, pins, fish hooks, horseshoe nails, shipbuilding nails, paper clips, thumb tacks and a series of other metallic wire-based products. Over the years, Mustad was a crucial part of Gj√∏vik and the region as a large number of the population was involved with the company and its many products. In addition to products made of metal wire, Mustad tested the waters of many other markets. Ovens and waffle presses were in production for many years and are still found today. For over 100 years, Mustad also competed in the butter industry in Norway. alt= = Finding focus = A key to the company's success was the efforts made by Mathias Topp, a carpenter turned inventor who designed and created a machine to create hooks automatically and quickly. His first successful machine produced hooks efficiently and quicker than ever before. Feeding wire into the machine led to a cut, bent, barbed, and pointed hook. Knowing the importance of this invention to the company, Topp and the Mustad family worked to keep the secret by, instead of ordering a patent, restricting workers from getting near the machines and signing non-disclosure agreementsTerje Paulsberg, \\"Mustad - Fish Hooks for the World\\"; Alfa Forlag AS, 2007. By refining and industrializing the manual production of fish hooks in 1877, the company managed to become a global market leader in just a few years. = The Core of Gj√∏vik = The growth and successes of the 1870s were followed by recession, mirroring the overall European crisis. The stagnation of the building activities resulted in a decreasing demand for nails. Hans Mustad, who had taken the management over, experienced a very critical time which brought him to the suspension of all payments in 1879. Fear took hold of creditors and employees, as so many other companies had gone bankrupt in the same period. Employees continued working without payment for 2 years. They received \\"Mustad banknotes\\" instead: the notes acted as written acknowledgments from Mustad and were accepted by shops in Gj√∏vik. The whole debt including interests was paid back by July 1882 and all creditors got their check.Terje Paulsberg, \\"Mustad - Fish Hooks for the World\\"; Alfa Forlag AS, 2007 Since then, the company assumed wider responsibilities over employees and their families: children were provided schools and several recreational and welfare activities were offered. Hans Mustad's social disposition attracted attention of the press that started visiting the factory premises and its schools, band, choir, library and shop. = Wars = These years were also crucial for the international development of the company. The obstacles at the time were mainly protectionism and tariffs: A. Tena, 2007; Tariff Structure and Institutions in the Late 19th Century. New Perspectives on the Tariff Growth Paradox (Ekonomisk-historiska institutionen) the decision was taken to start production within the international markets with the biggest potential. A nail factory was established in Finland in 1886, shortly followed by horseshoe nail factories in France (Duclair, 1891) and Sweden (Dalsland, 1898). Just before World War I, Europe consisted of five great powers (the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), plus another two nations were large consumers of horseshoe nails (Italy and Spain). In 1913 Mustad was established in all of them with the exception of Russia. Localisation criteria for the plants were mainly the access to energy, raw materials and transportation. The decentralized strategic approach proved very effective for Mustad when - after World War II - the company lost all its factories behind the iron curtain, including about 8,000 employees. The independent structures survived the war and grew rapidly to new successes. In the second half of the 20th century Mustad has increasingly diversified its interests into many different businesses, mostly based upon metallic wire, but also expanding into food and machinery: paper clips (of which Mustad turned out 70 million pieces a year), mattress springs, zippers, screws, margarine (which was produced for over 100 years and discontinued only in 1996), machines for the paper industry and for the manufacturing of boxes. Family ownership After Hans Schikkelstad stated the business, it was his son-in-law Ole Mustad who took over upon his death. With the help of his son Hans, Ole grew the business beyond nails and wire. From 1874 to the death of Ole, The two were co-owners of O. Mustad & S√∏n. Ole Mustad died in 1884, leaving his son as the single owner. Hans' five sons became co-owners in 1905. These were Ole Mustad, Jr. (1870‚Äì1954), Hans Clarin Hovind Mustad (1871‚Äì1948), Halfdan Magnus Mustad (1874‚Äì1967), Wilhelm Martin Christie Mustad (1877‚Äì1961) and Nicolai Christian Mustad (1878‚Äì1970).

Except for route numbers, there are a maximum of three signs on a pole, with the most important sign at the top. All signs have a reflective layer added on selected parts of the sign as is custom in European countries; most larger signs also have their own illumination. Most signs are based on pictograms, with some exceptions like the prohibition-sign for stop at customs and signal and speed limit signs. If the sign includes text, the text is written in Swedish, except the stop sign, which is written in English (\\"STOP\\"). Swedish road signs depict people with realistic (as opposed to stylized) silhouettes. Major differences between Swedish and general European signs Like other countries in Europe, Swedish signs follow the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. Whereas European signs usually have white background on warning and prohibition signs, the Swedish signs have a yellow/orange colour. This is for the purpose of enhancing the visibility of the sign during the winter, as white signs would be hard to see in the snow. The prohibition signs have a red line across them if there is a symbol on them, not if it is a numeric value. General European prohibition signs do not usually have such a red line. Swedish warning and prohibition signs also have a thicker border than their European counterparts. Traffic signs in Slovenia and Finland are quite similar. History Around 1930 some warning signs and prohibitory signs looking like today's signs with yellow background were introduced. The direction indication signs were however yellow with black text. Around 1965, there was a reform where the colour of those were changed to dark blue with white text. Around 1980, Sweden followed the Vienna convention rule that motorways should have a different colour, so green was introduced for them, and medium blue for ordinary roads. Private road direction sign Private road sign The reason there is a sign indicating private road, is because they are not strictly private. A private road is a road that is not maintained by the state or municipality, but by a private person or association. An owner of a private road in Sweden can prohibit cars (but not people) from using the road. But if the state pays support for the maintenance, cars can't be prohibited. This is mostly the case if several families live along the road. Then they must form an association for it. The Swedish word for this kind of road is \\"enskild\\", that can be both translated to \\"private\\" and \\"individual\\". The background of the sign is yellow, indicating that the quality is often less good, and warning signs might be missing. Signs indicating roads owned by companies or leading to companies usually have white background instead. Warning signs Warning signs are triangular and have red borders, but in contrast with those of most other countries that use triangular warning signs, Swedish signs have yellow backgrounds, rather than white. More types of warning signs for animals are used than in most European countries, such as moose, deer, wild boar, reindeer, sheep, horse, and cow appearing alongside roads.

His literary correspondence put him at the center of a European network of virtuosi. He was also a noted botanist, bibliophile and collector of scientific instruments. He died in Padua, where he is commemorated by Vincenzo Pinelli, and by the Aroid genus Pinellia. Collector His enormous library was probably the greatest in 16th-century Italy, consisting of around 8,500 printed works at the moment of his death, plus hundreds of manuscripts. When he died, in 1601, Nicolas Fabri de Peiresc was in his house and spent some of the following months studying his library and taking notes from its catalogues. Pinelli's secretary, Paolo Gualdo, wrote and published (1607) a biography of Pinelli which is also the portrait of the perfect scholar and book-collector. His collection of manuscripts, when it was purchased from his estate in 1608 for the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, filled 70 cases. Pinelli stood out among the early bibliophile collectors who established scientific bases for the methodically assembled private library, aided by the comparatively new figure--in the European world-- of the bookseller. His love of books and manuscripts, and his interest in optics, labored under a disability: a childhood mishap had destroyed the vision of one eye, forcing him to protect his weak vision with green-tinted lenses. Cautious and withdrawn by nature, detesting travel whether by road or canal boat, wracked by the gallstones that eventually killed him, he found solace in the library he amassed over a period of fifty years (Nuovo 2003). Leonardo's treatise on painting, Trattato della Pittura, was transcribed in the Codex Pinellianus ca. 1585, perhaps expressly for Pinelli who made annotations in it. Pinelli's codex was the source for the Barberini codex from which it was eventually printed, ostensibly edited by Raphael du Fresne, in 1651 . Pinelli's interest in the new science of optics was formative for Galileo Galilei, for whom Pinelli opened his library in the 1590s, where Galileo read the unpublished manuscripts, consisting of lecture notes and drafts of essays on optics, of Ettore Ausonio, a Venetian mathematician and physician, and of Giuseppe Moleto, professor of mathematics at Padua (Dupre). Beside his Greek and Latin libraries of manuscripts his collection included the original Arabic manuscript from which was translated and printed the Descrizione dell'Africa of Leo Africanus. Other interests He was among Europe's early botanists, and also collected mathematical instruments. He had taken musical instruction from the great madrigalist Philippe de Monte, with whom he continued a correspondence. He kept his amanuensis Camillus Venetus (Zanettus) busy. In the field of botany, he collected herbs in his garden and corresponded with the father of Italian botany, Luca Ghini, who pioneered the techniques of drying and pressing plant material for a herbarium and whose papers he transcribed after Ghini's death, while the botanists who would be considered Ghini's heirs, like Andrea Mattioli and Ulisse Aldrovandi, clamored for them. Pinelli's voluminous correspondence with the French humanist and book collector Claude Dupuy was published in 2001. References *Paolo Gualdo, Vita Ioannis Vincentii Pinelli, Patricii Genuensis.

South River is home of Mikisew Provincial Park on the shores of Eagle Lake. Transportation The major form of transportation in South River is motorized vehicles. Highway 11 formerly passed through the town. Highway 11 was re-routed when it was upgraded to a closed-access highway and now passes west of the town, with an overpass over Eagle Lake Road. Construction for the bypass started in 2007 and was completed about 2011. South River is served by the South River-Sundridge District Airport, which is a small airport about three miles from the town. The South River railway station was served by the Northlander six days per week until autumn 2012. Currently, South River is served by the Ontario Northland bus and the privately-owned Northern Airport Passenger Service shuttle. History Logging in the area began in the 1860s, but it was not until 1881 when the first settlers, Robert Carter and his wife, arrived following the completion of the Grand Trunk Railway. Within a few years, they opened a general store and the new community, located on the eponymous South River, had hotels, a bank, a butcher shop, and jeweller. The river itself provided the power for a sawmill and grist mill, while also being used for log driving. In 1907, the village separated from Machar Township and was incorporated, with W.J. Ard as first reeve. On Thanksgiving weekend of 1997, tragedy stroke at the Hanson Homestead on Eagle Lake Road, when a lightning strike hit a group of eight working on the family maple syrup lines, and fatally injured Dino Devalis. This strike was brought to light in the 2009 Canadian documentary Act of God by Jennifer Baichwal and features an interview with Jean Ivens about the event. Local Industry and activities Cottagers are beginning to head north from Muskoka to more wilderness locations such as those found at Algonquin Moose Lodge in South River. Algonquin Moose Lodge is a resort that opened up in 2017. The lodge has accommodations for all types of budgets and varied accommodations such as a 3,200 square foot custom built log home, a smaller log home (that was original to the property) as well as some smaller cottages and even a tepee. This 32 acre resort is Algonquin's last frontier of unspoiled northern wilderness. A colourful local landmark is the Algonquin Motel, which uses painted cabins and rooms to attract visitors. The motel has been in operation for about seventy years. South River is the access point for another tourist attraction: dog sledding on the North Algonquin Dog Sled Trail. Park permits are required. Algonquin Park Canoe Trips out of South River are also available through Chocpaw, Northern Edge Algonquin, Northern Wilderness Trips, or Voyageur Quest Outfitting. The Stewart Coughlin Riding Ranch provides horseback rides and riding instruction. A popular swimming spot is Eagle Lake Narrows, which is served by a general store that rents canoes. The Hockey Opportunity Camp, for boys and girls from 7 ‚Äì 16 years old, is also on Eagle Lake. The Swift Canoe and Kayak Factory has been in South River since 1989. It employs about twenty people. In the summer, Swift canoes are for sale next to the Tourist Information centre. There are many locations for freshwater fishing for smallmouth bass, whitefish, pickerel, rainbow trout, speckled trout, brook trout, lake trout, splake, ling perch and smelt. There is a golf course, the Eagle Lake Golf and Country Club, which after decades as a nine-hole course, started expanding. It is currently a ten-hole course. An Indoor Golfer's Club is also available downtown. The town has a public library. Artists Doreen Wood and Sue Nugent live in South River. Artist Margaret Cunningham is in Eagle Lake. In town, Ren√©e's Caf√© brings live music and concerts to South River. South River has been home to a local microbrewery, Highlander Brew Co. since 2012. The brewery has opened a larger facility in 2017 which will encourage tourism to the area, as well as hosting a Brewery Technician School that will teach technique to aspiring beer craftspeople. Arts and crafts also attract tourism. One noticeable local enterprise is the studio of Groovy Glass Beads, where unique hand-made beads are made and sold. Ron Post makes handmade knives and sheaths. Other crafts are found at The Northern Crafter's Collective, Rustic Blessings, and the Bear Chair Company.

Consequently, any pre-measure on a ring containing all intervals of real numbers can be extended to the Borel algebra of the set of real numbers. This is an extremely powerful result of measure theory, and leads, for example, to the Lebesgue measure. The theorem is also sometimes known as the Carath√©odory-Fr√©chet extension theorem, the Carath√©odory-Hopf extension theorem, the Hopf extension theorem and the Hahn-Kolmogorov extension theorem. Quoting Paul Loya: \\"Warning: I've seen the following theorem called the Carath√©odory extension theorem, the Carath√©odory-Fr√©chet extension theorem, the Carath√©odory-Hopf extension theorem, the Hopf extension theorem, the Hahn- Kolmogorov extension theorem, and many others that I can't remember! We shall simply call it Extension Theorem. However, I read in Folland's book (p. 41) that the theorem is originally due to Maurice Ren√© Fr√©chet (1878‚Äì1973) who proved it in 1924.\\" Paul Loya (page 33). Introductory statement Several very similar statements of the theorem can be given. A slightly more involved one, based on semi-rings of sets, is given further down below. A shorter, simpler statement is as follows. In this form, it is often called the Hahn‚ÄìKolmogorov theorem. Let \\\\Sigma_0 be an algebra of subsets of a set X. Consider a function :\\\\mu_0\\\\colon \\\\Sigma_0 \\\\to[0,\\\\infty] which is finitely additive, meaning that : \\\\mu_0\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{n=1}^N A_n\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\mu_0(A_n) for any positive integer N and A_1, A_2, \\\\dots, A_N disjoint sets in \\\\Sigma_0. Assume that this function satisfies the stronger sigma additivity assumption : \\\\mu_0\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\\\infty A_n\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\mu_0(A_n) for any disjoint family \\\\\\\\{A_n:n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\\\\\} of elements of \\\\Sigma_0 such that \\\\cup_{n=1}^\\\\infty A_n\\\\in \\\\Sigma_0. (Functions \\\\mu_0 obeying these two properties are known as pre-measures.) Then, \\\\mu_0 extends to a measure defined on the sigma-algebra \\\\Sigma generated by \\\\Sigma_0; i.e., there exists a measure :\\\\mu \\\\colon \\\\Sigma \\\\to[0,\\\\infty] such that its restriction to \\\\Sigma_0 coincides with \\\\mu_0. If \\\\mu_0 is \\\\sigma-finite, then the extension is unique. =Comments= This theorem is remarkable for it allows one to construct a measure by first defining it on a small algebra of sets, where its sigma additivity could be easy to verify, and then this theorem guarantees its extension to a sigma-algebra. The proof of this theorem is not trivial, since it requires extending \\\\mu_0 from an algebra of sets to a potentially much bigger sigma-algebra, guaranteeing that the extension is unique (if \\\\mu_0 is \\\\sigma-finite), and moreover that it does not fail to satisfy the sigma- additivity of the original function.  Semi-ring and ring  = Definitions = For a given set \\\\Omega, we may define a semi-ring as a subset \\\\mathcal{S} of \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Omega), the power set of \\\\Omega, which has the following properties: * \\\\emptyset \\\\in S * For all A, B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} , we have A \\\\cap B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} (closed under pairwise intersections) * For all A, B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} , there exist disjoint sets K_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}, i=1,2,\\\\dots,n , such that A \\\\setminus B = \\\\bigcup_{i = 1}^n K_i (relative complements can be written as finite disjoint unions). The first property can be replaced with \\\\mathcal{S} eq \\\\emptyset since A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\implies A \\\\setminus A = \\\\emptyset \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} . With the same notation, we define a ring \\\\mathcal{R} as a subset of the power set of \\\\Omega which has the following properties: * \\\\emptyset \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R} * For all A, B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R} , we have A \\\\cup B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R} (closed under pairwise unions) * For all A, B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R} , we have A \\\\setminus B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R} (closed under relative complements). Thus, any ring on \\\\Omega is also a semi-ring. Sometimes, the following constraint is added in the measure theory context: * \\\\Omega is the disjoint union of a countable family of sets in \\\\mathcal{S} . A field of sets (respectively, a semi-field) is a ring (respectively, a semi-ring) that also contains \\\\Omega as one of its elements. = Properties = * Arbitrary (possibly uncountable) intersections of rings on Œ© are still rings on Œ©. * If A is a non-empty subset of \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Omega), then we define the ring generated by A (noted R(A)) as the intersection of all rings containing A. It is straightforward to see that the ring generated by A is the smallest ring containing A. * For a semi-ring S, the set of all finite unions of sets in S is the ring generated by S: :R(S) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ A: A = \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}{A_i}, A_i \\\\in S \\\\right\\\\\\\\} (One can show that R(S) is equal to the set of all finite disjoint unions of sets in S). * A content Œº defined on a semi-ring S can be extended on the ring generated by S. Such an extension is unique. The extended content can be written: :\\\\mu(A) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\mu(A_i)} for A = \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}{A_i}, with the A_i \\\\in S disjoint. In addition, it can be proved that Œº is a pre-measure if and only if the extended content is also a pre-measure, and that any pre-measure on R(S) that extends the pre-measure on S is necessarily of this form. = Motivation = In measure theory, we are not interested in semi-rings and rings themselves, but rather in œÉ-algebras generated by them. The idea is that it is possible to build a pre-measure on a semi-ring S (for example Stieltjes measures), which can then be extended to a pre-measure on R(S), which can finally be extended to a measure on a œÉ-algebra through Caratheodory's extension theorem. As œÉ-algebras generated by semi-rings and rings are the same, the difference does not really matter (in the measure theory context at least). Actually, Carath√©odory's extension theorem can be slightly generalized by replacing ring by semi-field. The definition of semi-ring may seem a bit convoluted, but the following example shows why it is useful (moreover it allows us to give an explicit representation of the smallest ring containing some semi-ring). = Example = Think about the subset of \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}) defined by the set of all half-open intervals [a, b) for a and b reals. This is a semi-ring, but not a ring. Stieltjes measures are defined on intervals; the countable additivity on the semi-ring is not too difficult to prove because we only consider countable unions of intervals which are intervals themselves. Proving it for arbitrary countable unions of intervals is accomplished using Caratheodory's theorem. Statement of the theorem Let R be a ring on \\\\Omega and let be a pre-measure on R, i.e. for all sets A \\\\in R for which there exists a countable decomposition A = \\\\bigcup_{i = 1}^\\\\infty A_i in disjoint sets A_i \\\\in R, \\\\forall i=1, 2, \\\\ldots, we have \\\\mu(A) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\mu(A_i). Let œÉ(R) be the œÉ-algebra generated by R. The pre-measure condition is a necessary condition for \\\\mu to be the restriction to R of a measure on \\\\sigma(R). The Carath√©odory's extension theorem states that it is also sufficient, i.e. there exists a measure such that is an extension of Œº. (That is, ). Moreover, if Œº is œÉ-finite then the extension is unique (and also œÉ-finite). Examples of non- uniqueness of extension There can be more than one extension of a pre- measure to the generated œÉ-algebra, if the pre-measure is not sigma-finite. =Via the counting measure= Take the algebra generated by all half-open intervals [a,b) on the real line, and give such intervals measure infinity if they are non-empty. The Carath√©odory extension gives all non-empty sets measure infinity. Another extension is given by the counting measure. =Via rationals= This example is a more detailed variation of the above. The rational closed-open interval is any subset of \\\\mathbb{Q} of the form [a,b), where a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}. Let X be \\\\mathbb{Q}\\\\cap[0,1) and let \\\\Sigma_0 be the algebra of all finite unions of rational closed-open intervals contained in \\\\mathbb{Q}\\\\cap[0,1). It is easy to prove that \\\\Sigma_0 is, in fact, an algebra. It is also easy to see that the cardinal of every non-empty set in \\\\Sigma_0 is \\\\aleph_0. Let \\\\mu_0 be the counting set function (\\\\\\\\#) defined in \\\\Sigma_0. It is clear that \\\\mu_0 is finitely additive and \\\\sigma-additive in \\\\Sigma_0. Since every non-empty set in \\\\Sigma_0 is infinite, then, for every non-empty set A\\\\in\\\\Sigma_0, \\\\mu_0(A)=+\\\\infty Now, let \\\\Sigma be the \\\\sigma- algebra generated by \\\\Sigma_0. It is easy to see that \\\\Sigma is the Borel \\\\sigma-algebra of subsets of X, and both \\\\\\\\# and 2\\\\\\\\# are measures defined on \\\\Sigma and both are extensions of \\\\mu_0. =Via Fubini's theorem= Another example is closely related to the failure of some forms of Fubini's theorem for spaces that are not œÉ-finite. Suppose that X is the unit interval with Lebesgue measure and Y is the unit interval with the discrete counting measure. Let the ring R be generated by products A√óB where A is Lebesgue measurable and B is any subset, and give this set the measure Œº(A)card(B). This has a very large number of different extensions to a measure; for example: *The measure of a subset is the sum of the measures of its horizontal sections. This is the smallest possible extension. Here the diagonal has measure 0. *The measure of a subset is \\\\int_0^1n(x)dx where n(x) is the number of points of the subset with given x-coordinate. The diagonal has measure 1. *The Carath√©odory extension, which is the largest possible extension. Any subset of finite measure is contained in some union of a countable number of horizontal lines. In particular the diagonal has measure infinity.

The Ottawa Chamberfest summer festival is a music festival held by Ottawa Chamberfest, also known as Chamberfest, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. This year's edition will be held between July 25 and August 8, 2019. Artists In 1994, the idea of a chamber music festival in Ottawa came to life to remedy the meager availability of live classical music during the summer months and fill the city‚Äôs churches with splendid sounds. Ottawa Chamberfest started life as the Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival with 22 concerts in two churches and was an immediate hit. Growing steadily over the years, the 2011 edition of Ottawa Chamberfest presented almost 100 concerts, attracting over 80,000 listeners and is the largest chamber music festival of its kind in the world. Roman Borys, the cellist of the Juno award-winning Gryphon Trio is the Artistic and Executive Director of Ottawa Chamberfest. His fellow trio members, violinist Annalee Patipatanakoon and pianist James Parker, are among the organization's artistic advisors.http://www.chamberfest.com/about/artistic-direction/ Among those who performed in the 2011 edition of the festival were Jan Lisiecki, Isabel Bayrakdarian, Simone Dinnerstein, Marc-Andr√© Hamelin, Julie Nesrallah, Yehonatan Berick, National Arts Centre Orchestra, The Swingle Singers, Nexus (ensemble), Trio con Brio Copenhagen, New Zealand String Quartet, TorQ Percussion Quartet and more. Past performers include Paul Merkelo, Patrick Wedd, Guy Fouquet, Musica Camerata, St√©phane Lemelin, the Borodin String Quartet, the Beaux Arts Trio, the Tokyo String Quartet, Martin Beaver, Penderecki Quartet, Paul Stewart, Martin Chalifour, Monica Whicher, Jennifer Swartz, and Gino Quilico, Quartango, Neil Gripp, Richard Raymond, the St. Lawrence Quartet, Mayumi Seiler, Keller Quartet, and Adaskin String Trio. Music Although the concerts are primarily traditional classical music, the scope has evolved to include music by pop and jazz composers and also music from non-European countries. The concerts of a typical day would have several different types of music. For Ottawa Chamberfest 2011, performances are divided into several Concert Series. * Chamber Chat - Lecture series. * Music at Noon - Music at lunch. * New Music Now - Show casing new and emerging artists. * Meet the Artist - Meet several performers up close and personal. * Bring the Kids - Free shows for children. Interactive and fun. * 3PM Series - Afternoon shows * The Siskind Concerts - Nightly shows dedicated to Jacob Siskind, music critic and arts patron. * Market Soir√©es - Evening Shows with a focus on an intimate musical experience. * Alfresco Concerts and Guerilla Gigs - Free outdoor concerts at Rideau Hall and other undisclosed locations. * Late Night at the Kildare - Hosted by Saint Brigid's Church (Ottawa), a nightly series featuring a diverse set of performers. * Festival Gala Series - 3 high profile performances at Dominion-Chalmers United Church. Venues The concert venues are generally churches or cultural facilities in the heart of downtown Ottawa. The confirmed venues for Ottawa Chamberfest 2011 are: * Dominion-Chalmers United Church * Rideau Hall * Beechwood Cemetery * Saint Brigid's Church (Ottawa) * Anglican Church of St. John the Evangelist (Ottawa) In previous years the University of Ottawa was also a regular venue. The Festival has also used, on occasion, Southam Hall in the National Arts Centre for special gala concerts. Other activities Apart from the annual summer festival, Ottawa Chamberfest also organizes activities throughout the year. The Concert Series takes place from fall to spring offering approximately ten concerts per season.
