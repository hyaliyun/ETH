Flaming Gorge Dam forms the Flaming Gorge Reservoir, which extends into southern Wyoming, submerging four distinct gorges of the Green River. The dam is a major component of the Colorado River Storage Project, which stores and distributes upper Colorado River Basin water. The dam takes its name from a nearby section of the Green River canyon, named by John Wesley Powell in 1869. It was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation between 1958 and 1964. The dam is high and long, and its reservoir has a capacity of more than , or about twice the annual flow of the upper Green. Operated to provide long-term storage for downstream water-rights commitments, the dam is also a major source of hydroelectricity and is the main flood-control facility for the Green River system. The dam and reservoir have fragmented the upper Green River, blocking fish migration and significantly impacting many native species. Water released from the dam is generally cold and clear, as compared to the river's natural warm and silty flow, further changing the local riverine ecology. However, the cold water from Flaming Gorge has transformed about of the Green into a \\"Blue Ribbon Trout Fishery\\". The Flaming Gorge Reservoir, largely situated in Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, is also considered one of Utah and Wyoming's greatest fisheries. History and location Contrary to its namesake, Flaming Gorge, the dam actually lies in steep, rapid-strewn Red Canyon in northeastern Utah, close to where the Green River cuts through the Uinta Mountains. The canyon, for which the dam is named, is buried under the reservoir almost upstream. Red Canyon is the narrowest and deepest of the four on the Green in the area (Horseshoe, Kingfisher, Red and Flaming Gorge) which made it the best site for the building of a dam. Flaming Gorge, on the other hand, was named by John Wesley Powell on his 1869 expedition down the Green and Colorado rivers for the \\"brilliant, flaming red of its rocks [when the sun shone upon them].\\" Flaming Gorge Dam is one of six that make up the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP), a massive system of reservoirs created in the upper Colorado River Basin by the Bureau of Reclamation from the 1950s to the 1970s. The project itself was the indirect result of a system of agreements signed by the seven U.S. states and two Mexican provinces in the early 20th century dividing the flow of the Colorado River among them. Among the terms stated in the 1922 Colorado River Compact reserved for the Upper Basin states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico and an equal amount for the Lower Basin states of Arizona, Nevada and California. Due to the Colorado's high year-to-year variations in flow, the upper basin could not fulfill the lower basin's allotments in dry years, and much water was wasted during wet years because of the lack of a means to impound it. Well before the CRSP's inception in 1956, the Bureau had begun to look for suitable reservoir sites along the upper Colorado and tributaries such as the Green, San Juan and Gunnison Rivers. One of the earlier proposals was called Echo Park Dam, at the confluence of the Green and Yampa Rivers within the Dinosaur National Monument in northwestern Colorado. The Sierra Club, led by David Brower, rallied against the proposal in the media and later in the courts. When the Bureau backed down from the Echo Park proposal, it was seen as one of the environmentalism movement's early victories ‚Äì but it came with a compromise. A dam would still be built on the Green River, just upstream near a brilliant red-rock canyon called Flaming Gorge. A common misconception is that the building of the controversial Glen Canyon Dam was part of this \\"compromise for Echo Park\\", but in reality the Bureau had always planned to build a dam at Glen Canyon regardless of the outcome of the Echo Park debate.  Climate  Construction The building of Flaming Gorge Dam started just a few months after the CRSP was approved in Congress, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower pressed a button on his desk in the White House and set off the first blast in Red Canyon. Site preparations and geologic inspections continued as Dutch John, the company town that provided housing for the workers, was completed just northeast of the dam site by 1958. More than 3000 people would inhabit Dutch John at the peak of construction. The main contract for dam construction was awarded to Arch Dam Constructors, a conglomerate of Peter Kiewit Sons, Morrison-Knudsen Company, Mid-Valley Utility Constructors Inc. and Coker Construction Company. Actual construction at the dam site did not begin until late 1958, when work began on the diversion tunnel that would send the Green River around the dam site in order to clear it. Construction work on Flaming Gorge Dam, 1962 By April 1959, excavation of the diversion tunnel had been completed and concrete lining was finished on August 17. Work on a pair of earthen cofferdams above and below the dam site commenced when the tunnel was ready and the river was channeled around the dam site on November 19 with the completion of the upper cofferdam. Keyway (foundation) excavations for the dam on the right abutment and construction of the spillway inlet works in the left abutment was begun in September, and all preliminary canyon wall structures were complete by early 1960. The lower cofferdam was finished in February, allowing workers to pump water out of the space between the two barriers. The silt and sediment that comprised the riverbed had to be removed in order to reach solid rock where foundations could be drilled; this was completed in August 1960, allowing work on the main dam foundations to begin. Flaming Gorge was built in block-shaped stages of concrete called \\"forms\\". The first concrete for the powerhouse was placed on September 8, and construction of the main dam wall began ten days later. In order to accelerate hardening of the concrete, cold water was pumped through metal tubing, or \\"coils\\", embedded in the structure. Concrete placement continued until November 15, 1962, when workers topped out the dam. By the end of 1962, both the river outlet works and the spillway tunnel were completed, and the diversion tunnel was closed, allowing water to begin rising behind the dam. The dam's hydroelectric generators were installed by mid‚ÄìAugust 1963 and the first unit went into operation on September 27 at the press of a switch by President John F. Kennedy. The dam was officially dedicated by Lady Bird Johnson on August 17 of the following year. Dimensions and operations Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Wyoming =Dam and reservoir= The Flaming Gorge Dam stands high above its foundations and above the Green River. It measures long along its crest, with a maximum base thickness of , while its crest thickness is . The dam contains about of concrete. The reservoir first reached its maximum elevation of in August 1974, with a maximum surface area of . The conservation storage capacity is , of which is active capacity, useful for release and power generation. During floods the reservoir can go about higher, for a total of , spreading over . =Power plant= The dam's hydroelectric power plant is located at its base. It consists of three 50,650 kilowatt generators, powered by three Francis design turbines of . The total nameplate generating capacity of the Flaming Gorge Dam is 151,950 kilowatts. Three diameter penstocks feed water to the power plant. The Bureau of Reclamation operates the power plant, and the Western Area Power Administration markets the power generated by the dam. The original 1963 capacity of the powerplant was 108,000 kilowatts, or 36,000 kilowatts per generator. The generators were uprated to their present capacity between August 1990 and April 1992. The power plant originally operated on a peaking basis which caused large daily fluctuations in river flow, with sharp peaks in the daytime and extremely low flows at night. In 1992, the release patterns from the dam were placed under legal constraints due to a biological opinion to protect endangered fish species. In 2006 the release patterns were further modified under an \\"Action Alternative\\" designed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in order to mimic natural flows. The power plant now releases water based on the natural seasonal hydrograph of the Green River before damming. In addition, water flows must be maintained above at all times. On August 11, 1977, the Unit 2 turbine, jammed after one of the sealing rings on the penstock failed. This event led to the seal rings on all three penstocks being replaced. These seal rings also failed, and were replaced again. However, no major structural damage to the dam occurred. =Spillways= The spillway consists of a long tunnel that runs through the left abutment of the dam. Two gates at the tunnel entrance will pass up to of floodwater. At its upstream end the tunnel is in diameter, and at the discharge point is in diameter. The dam's outlet works consist of two diameter steel pipes through the dam. The discharge capacity of the outlet works is . Due to the large storage capacity of the reservoir, the tunnel spillway is rarely used, except for high water years such as 1983‚Äì84. As originally built, the spillway suffered cavitation damage caused by the high velocity of water rushing over the concrete lining. The installation of an aeration slot in the spillway in the mid-1980s remediated these problems. Environmental impacts An aerial view of the Flaming Gorge Dam, by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. By halting floods and artificially increasing low flows, Flaming Gorge Dam has changed the characteristics of the Green River tremendously, especially above its confluence with the Yampa River: \\"The deafening roar of the spring flood through the Canyon of Lodore in Dinosaur National Monument is subdued to the point that the sound no longer conveys a sense of the power that created this very place.\\" River regulation has led to the growth of riparian zones along the Green River where they would not have developed naturally because of the erosive effects of floods. The reduction in flow changes has also caused a decline in amphibian habitat along the river. The dam traps the river's high sediment loads, which has been detrimental to many native fish stocks. The cold and clear water releases have caused loss of sandbars, bank erosion, and as a result crucial habitat of four species of native fish in parts of the Green River have been lost. On August 28, 2008, the Bureau of Reclamation prepared an EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) on the operation of the dam to meet the river flow required by Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. The four native fishes affected are the razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, humpback chub, and bonytail chub. The cold water, however, has allowed the proliferation of introduced trout populations. About of the Green River below the dam is designated as a \\"Blue Ribbon Trout Fishery\\", below which the water tends to be warmer and more suitable for native species. In addition, Flaming Gorge Reservoir has become \\"nationally known for the spectacular fishing available in the reservoir's cool clear water which is ideal for growing large trout\\". Proposed water diversion In the early 21st century, the Colorado River system has come under stress due to a severe drought. Colorado's fast- growing Front Range Urban Corridor, which is not situated in the Colorado River basin but receives water from it via diversions across the Rocky Mountains, is projected to run out of water in as little as 20 years if no new supplies are developed. One contentious proposal to augment the water supply is via a pipeline from Flaming Gorge Reservoir to southeastern Wyoming and thence to eastern Colorado. The $9 billion diversion would provide about of new water per year for the Front Range. Although eastern Colorado is lower in elevation than Flaming Gorge Reservoir, the water would have to be pumped over the Rocky Mountains, making the project a net power consumer. The proposal has caused significant disputes over water rights with about 87 percent of Wyoming residents polled opposing the project. Both the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have denied permits for the project's construction. The lower end of Flaming Gorge Reservoir is seen nearly full in July 2010. The Flaming Gorge Dam is seen to the left.

Its main source is in the parish of Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire and it flows for its whole course ENE into Berkshire, where it discharges into the Kennet at Hungerford, which has a smaller average flow and width upstream of that point. The Dun valley is an important transport route through the high chalklands between the London Basin to the east and the Vale of Pewsey to the west. It is the route by which the Kennet and Avon Canal (linking London and Bristol) enters the Thames basin from the Vale of Pewsey, crossing the watershed with the aid of the Bruce Tunnel and Crofton Pumping Station. The later Reading to Plymouth railway linking London and the south-west also uses the valley. The Dun has two named tributaries: the Froxfield Stream joins on the left between Little Bedwyn and Hungerford, and the Shalbourne Stream on the right above Hungerford. During or after the building of the Kennet and Avon Canal in the late 18th century, the Shalbourne was diverted into it.

Marian Marianovich Peretyatkovich (; 23 August 1872, Usychi (–£—Å–∏—á—ñ in Ukrainian), Volhyn (now Ukraine) ‚Äî 22 May 1916, Kyiv (Ukraine) was a Russian and Ukrainian architect. His premature death at the age of 43 limited his career to only eight years of independent practice (1908-1916), however, he managed to excel in a rational (Finnish) variety of late Art Nouveau, Renaissance Revival and Russian Revival in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. He is sometimes compared with Louis Sullivan on account of his insistence on functionality of office buildings. Biography =Training= Peretyatkovich trained at Saint Petersburg Institute of Civil Engineers, graduating in 1901, and the Imperial Academy of Arts under Leon Benois (1901-1906). Still at college, Peretyatkovich became famous as a refined draftsman; architect like Gavriil Baranovsky, Roman Klein and Ivan Rerberg hired him for drafting and interior designs. Thus, Peretyatkovich was involved in such high-profile jobs as the Hotel Metropol, Elisseeff Emporium, and the Pushkin Museum. Before graduation, Peretyatkovich secured a solid reputation among professionals in both capitals of Russia. In 1907, he travelled over Europe on the Academy study tour, and learned the Finnish version of Art Nouveau practiced by Eliel Saarinen and Lars Sonck, as well as Roman architecture of Southern Europe; both these styles became the trademarks of his short career. =Own practice= On his return from Europe, Peretyatkovich designed his first major project - Solodovnikov's Cheap Apartment Building in Moscow (it was executed by Traugott Bardt), a typical Northern Moderne, Saint Petersburg version of Art Nouveau. His second project - the Northern Insurance Buildings in Moscow, was executed in collaboration with Ivan Rerberg and Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky in stern Neoclassical Revival. This buildings are also notable as Ilya Golosov's first employment and for Sergei Rachmaninoff melody written for the chiming clock. Now, they house the Constitutional Court of Russia. In Saint Petersburg, Peretyatkovich designed various office and residential buildings; the best known, Wawelberg Trade Bank (1911-1912), combines neoclassical composition with Renaissance exterior (in the same period, Ivan Zholtovsky built a similar but far smaller Tarasov House in Moscow). The historicist dimension of Peretiatkovich's work is even more pronounced in his designs for St Petersburg churches. He oversaw the construction of the Saviour Church \\"on Waters\\" (–°–ø–∞—Å-–Ω–∞-–í–æ–¥–∞—Ö), inspired by the 12th-century architecture of Vladimir-Suzdal and commemorating Russian sailors who perished during the Russo-Japanese War. The church was demolished by the Leningrad authorities in 1932. His other major project was the Roman Catholic church of Notre-Dame de Lourdes (1908‚Äì09), inspired by Romanesque architecture of Northern Europe and designed in collaboration with Leon Benois. His last work was a memorial chapel for the late Prince Oleg Konstantinovich of Russia, modelled after historical Pskov churches. Legacy Peretyatkovich, as the youngest member of Neoclassical Revival movement after 1915, had a solid influence on Saint Petersburg architects of his period, securing the leading role of this style together with Vladimir Shchuko and Ivan Fomin. His early reputation as a talented graphic artist in college and a very short architectural career that left a lasting influence are reminiscent of another architect, Konstantin Melnikov.

The inhabitants of Ellipi were close relatives of the Elamites. History The period of major development in Ellipi was from the 9th to 7th centuries BC, as is reflected in archaeological research. The prosperity of the country came from the control of trade routes. They were also cattle dealers. It functioned as a buffer state between Assyrian provinces of Kishesim (Kar-Nergal) and Harhar (Kar- Sharrukin) and Elam.Elayi 2017:170 Assyrian Vassal During the 8th and 7th centuries BC it was ruled by an Iranicized dynasty. =Talta of Ellipi (d. 707 BC)= Talta (Dalta) was the King of Ellipi. He was probably on the throne contemporary with Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser III (r. 745-727 BC) and Shalmaneser V (r. 727-722 BC). He paid tribute to the Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 722-705 BC) since 714 BC. =War of Succession (Civil War)= In 707 BC, when Talta died of old age, his (sister's?) sons Nibe, supported by Elam, and Ishparaba, supported by Sargon II, started a civil war with Ishparaba winning and becoming king of Ellipi. =Ishparaba of Ellipi= In 703 BC, Ellipi was implicated in the Babylonian rebellions of Marduk-apal-iddina II against Assyria. In 702 BC, he was strongly punished by king Sennacherib of Assyria, who took Marubishti, the capital city. The Sennacherib Prism Column 2 states: \\"The front of my yoke I turned around and took the road to the land of the Elippi. Before me Ispab√¢ra, their king, abandoned his strong cities, his treasurehouses, and fled to the distant parts. Over the whole of his wide land I swept like a hurricane. The cities Marubishti and Akkuddu, his royal residence-cities, together with 34 small towns of their area, I besieged, I captured, I destroyed, I devastated, I burned with fire. The people, great and small, male and female, horses, mules, asses, camels, cattle, and sheep, without number I carried off. I brought him to nothing; I diminished his land.\\"Luckenbill 1924:27-31 =Fall= During the 7th century BC, Ellipi suffered Cimmerian invasions, and then disappeared from sources.

The first published O14 standards appeared in Model Railway Constructor magazine, September 1951. The article was titled \\"A Narrow Gauge Layout\\" and was by Douglas Clayton. He advocated HO standards, less 2.5mm coupled with coarse scale OO wheelsets set to 12.5 mm back to back. A subsequent article in 1953 provided details of his layout. Very little more happened regards the development of O14 until Roy Link published a new set of standards (1993 ‚Äî revised 1994) in his magazine Narrow Gauge and Industrial Railway Modelling Review. They were developed for his range of O14 kits ‚Äî now produced by David Janes under the name KBscale. They are based on the proven 4 mm scale EM standards (BRMSB) and are reasonably close to exact scale especially considering the variations to be found in prototype nominal gauge railways.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole and is incarcerated at Old Colony Correctional Center.  Background  Neil Entwistle was born near Nottingham and attended the University of York, receiving a master's degree in electronic engineering. He grew up in Worksop with his parents, Clifford and Yvonne, and his younger brother Russell. Entwistle's home was working class; his father was a coal miner and his mother was a cook at a school canteen. While at university, Entwistle met Rachel Souza, an American who was studying abroad. They married on August 23, 2003, in Plymouth. They moved to Worcestershire, where their daughter Lillian was born on April 9, 2005. Entwistle worked in computing and his wife as a teacher of English, Drama and Theatre Studies at St. Augustine's Catholic High School in Redditch. After migrating to the US, the couple stayed with Rachel's mother and stepfather, Joseph and Priscilla Matterazzo, in Carver, Massachusetts, before finding a house of their own in Hopkinton, located 26 miles (6.6 kilometers) west of Boston. Murders The bodies of 27-year-old Rachel and 9-month-old Lillian were found on 22 January 2006 in the master bedroom of the family's rented home, where they had been living for only ten days. Autopsy results showed that Rachel died of a gunshot wound to the head and Lillian of a gunshot wound to the torso. The bullet that passed through Lillian also pierced Rachel's left breast. The bullets were so small that the one in Rachel's head went undetected until the autopsy. Hours after the deaths of his wife and daughter, Entwistle purchased a one-way ticket to London at about 5:00 a.m. (EST) on 21 January and boarded a British Airways flight that departed Boston at 8:15 a.m. His speedy departure from the crime scene was not the only reason he raised suspicion: Entwistle's DNA was found on the handle of the same .22 handgun owned by his father-in-law that he told authorities he had only used once, months earlier, while practising at Joseph Matterazzo's shooting club. DNA matching that of his wife was found on the gun's muzzle. A set of keys to Materazzo's house were found in the car Entwistle left at Boston's Logan International Airport. A search of Entwistle's computer revealed that days before the murders, he had looked at a website that described \\"how to kill people\\" and searched for escort services. Contrary to outward appearances, Entwistle had been unemployed since September 2005 and was indebted at the time of the murders. Though he claimed an income of $10,000 per month from an \\"offshore account\\" set up by his previous employer in the UK, Entwistle had no such income or account. He was also more than $30,000 in credit card debt and was under investigation by eBay for numerous fraudulent transactions. Authorities suspected a financial motivation for the murders. Investigation and evidence On the evening of 21 January, the day after the murders are believed to have been committed, police officers visited the Entwistles' home after Rachel's friend reported her missing. Though the police conducted a cursory inspection of the house, they failed to notice Rachel's and Lillian's bodies, obscured under a pile of bedding in the master bedroom. A second and more thorough search the following evening discovered their bodies.US Police 'failed to spot bodies', BBC News, 11 June 2008 On 23 January, a Massachusetts State Police trooper called Entwistle at his parents' home in Worksop. The call lasted two hours and was recorded. Entwistle told the trooper that, on the morning of the murders, he had left his Hopkinton home at around 9:00 a.m. (EST) to run an errand and that his wife and daughter had both been alive and well, in the bed in the couple's master bedroom. He claimed that when he returned, at around 11:00 a.m., he found both had been shot dead, and had no idea who had killed them. Entwistle covered their bodies with a blanket and did not alert authorities. Entwistle claimed that he was so distraught upon seeing the corpses of his wife and daughter that he decided to kill himself. However, because he was unable to bring himself to end his life with a knife, he drove the family car to the Materazzos' house to get a .22LR caliber revolver. Finding the house locked, he told police that he decided to fly home to England to see his parents. Police subsequently named Entwistle as a person of interest in the investigation, and later issued an international arrest warrant. On 9 February 2006, Entwistle was arrested on a London Underground train at Royal Oak station following a detailed search of his parents' house. After an initial request that he not be sent back to the US, he later agreed to be extradited. Middlesex County district attorney Martha Coakley (who had successfully prosecuted British au pair Louise Woodward in 1997) told a press conference after Entwistle's arrest: Arrest and events prior to trial Rachel and Lillian were buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Kingston, Massachusetts, with the surname Souza on their graves. They were buried in a single coffin. Lillian's birth and death certificates were edited to read \\"father unknown\\". On 8 February 2006, a week after their funerals, Entwistle was arrested by the extradition unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service at Royal Oak station. He eventually waived his right to contest the extradition order and was returned to the US on 15 February where he was arraigned at Framingham District Court and ordered to be held without bail at Middlesex County jail in Cambridge. On 28 March, Entwistle was indicted on two counts of murder, the illegal possession of a firearm, and the illegal possession of ammunition. He pleaded not guilty. In December 2006, nearly a year after the murders, officers at the Middlesex County jail found letters from Entwistle to his parents and his legal team which indicated he was depressed and might be contemplating suicide. As a result, he was transferred to Bridgewater State Hospital for mental evaluation before being returned to Middlesex County.Murder accused moved to hospital, BBC News, 4 January 2007 Forensic psychiatrist Christopher Cordess believed Asperger syndrome explained Entwistle's behavior, and Dr. David Holmes concurred.Dr. David Holmes Interview, Crime Investigation After numerous delays, the Middlesex superior court began juror selection in June 2008. There were concerns that, due to the high-profile nature of the case, Entwistle would not receive a fair trial. Some media reported that potential jurors were indicating that they had already formed significant views on his guilt.Fairness of US murder trial questioned, BBC News, 6 June 2008 Trial and conviction Entwistle's trial for double murder began on 2 June 2008 in Woburn, Massachusetts.Accused 'had plan to sell story' His legal team, led by Elliot Weinstein, unsuccessfully fought proposals by the prosecution to use DNA evidence. He also unsuccessfully fought to suppress other evidence found in the family home, due to the lack of a warrant. Entwistle called no witnesses, nor did he testify in his own defense. Entwistle was found guilty of all charges on 25 June 2008 and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the mandatory sentence for first degree murder in the state of Massachusetts. Judge Diane Kottmyer made it clear that this was a whole life sentence, subject only to a governor's pardon or successful appeal. Kottmyer imposed two life sentences on the murder charges and ten years of probation on the firearms and ammunition charges, all to run concurrently, and the condition that he never profit from the sale of his story.Entwistle Given 2 Life Sentences, WCVB-TV, 26 June 2008.

He arranged for a new lawyer to represent him in his appeal, since his original lawyer, Weinstein, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and dropped the case to focus on recovery.New lawyer will assist in Neil Entwistle appeal bid - BostonHerald.com On appeal, Entwistle argued that the searches of the family home were carried out without warrants and the evidence seized as a result should have been suppressed during the trial. The appeal was rejected in August 2012. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in January 2013. Entwistle has thus exhausted all of his appeals.Press Association (in Guardian newspaper 14 August 2012): Entwistle loses US murder appeal In October 2008, Entwistle's parents filed a complaint of harassment with the UK Press Complaints Commission (PCC) against their local newspaper, the Worksop Guardian; the complaint was rejected. His parents continue to insist that their son is innocent of the murders, that Rachel was the true killer and that he will eventually be cleared and released from prison.

The best-known species in this genus is the domestic guinea pig, Cavia porcellus, an important meat animal in South America and a common household pet outside South America. Former taxonomic controversy Cavia is classified in order Rodentia, although there was once a minority belief in the scientific community that evidence from mitochondrial DNA and proteins suggested the Hystricognathi might belong to a different evolutionary offshoot, and therefore a different order. If this had been so, it would have been an example of convergent evolution. However, this uncertainty is largely of historical interest, as abundant molecular genetic evidence now conclusively supports classification of Cavia as rodents. (and references therein) This evidence includes draft genome sequences of Cavia porcellus and several other rodents. Species Historically, there has been little consensus in regard to the number of Cavia forms and their taxonomic affiliations. Morphological characters differentiating between Cavia species are limited and levels of inter and intra specific morphologic variation have not been well documented, thus, interpretations have varied and resulted in very different taxonomic conclusions. Three scientists disagreed on the number of species, Tate(1935) recognized 11 species, while Cabrera(1961) recognized 7, and Huckinghaus(1961) recognized only 3.

At exit 19, PA 28 merges with the limited-access US 422 and heads east along US 422 as it proceeds south of West Kittanning. Upon crossing the Allegheny River and entering Kittanning, US 422 and PA 28 interchange with Pennsylvania Route 66. PA 66 then joins the concurrency for two miles (3 km) to an exit with U.S. Route 422 Business southeast of downtown Kittanning. Here, US 422 leaves the freeway and heads east toward Indiana while PA 28 and PA 66 remain concurrent as they progress northward. The freeway ends with a concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 66. In Rayburn Township, PA 28/PA 66 intersects the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 85. After PA 85, PA 28/PA 66 head towards the northeast. In South Bethlehem, PA 28/PA 66 become North Street and Broad Street then intersecting the northern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 839. After crossing the Redbank Creek, PA 28/PA 66 enters Clarion County and New Bethlehem. In downtown New Bethlehem, PA 66 splits off from PA 28 and making the PA 28/PA 66 concurrency one of the longest concurrencies in Pennsylvania. After the split, PA 28 heads northeast as Broad Street paralleling the Redbank Creek. In Hawthorn, PA 28 is called Brookville Street and meets the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 536. North of PA 536, PA 28 begins to slide to the north instead of the northeast. In Summerville, PA 28's course begins to slide towards the northeast again and in Summerville, PA 28 is called Harrison Street. In Clover and Rose townships, PA 28 parallels many railroads tracks that even cross it. In Brookville, PA 28 has a wrong-way concurrency with U.S. Route 322 and Pennsylvania Route 36. The reason of the wrong-way concurrency is that PA 28 is heading north while PA 36 is heading south on the concurrency with US 322. In downtown Brookville, PA 36 splits off from US 322/PA 28. Then after crossing the North Fork Creek, US 322/PA 28 meet the southern terminus of the former Pennsylvania Route 968. East of here, US 322 splits off from PA 28 at a \\"T\\" interchange. East of Brookville in Pine Creek Township, PA 28 intersects Interstate 80 at exit 81 a diamond interchange. North of I-80, PA 28 continues north as a local road without intersecting another route for more than . PA 28 passes through the many wildlife in Pennsylvania through a forest region. In Brockway, PA 28 is called Main Street before terminating (ending) at a \\"T\\" intersection with U.S. Route 219. History The highway was signed in 1927 from Pittsburgh to Kittanning. It is named after Alexander Lindsay, a lawyer who lived in South Buffalo and commuted to work in Pittsburgh: he successfully lobbied for the city to be connected to the proposed Keystone Shortway (I-80). The highway was extended north to Brockway in 1928. In 1928, the route was under construction from Blawnox to Cheswick, Troy Hill Road to Oakland, and Hazen to Reitz Crossing Road. Those sections were completed the following year. In 1929, the section from Avella to Woodrow and from Hickory to Fort Cherry Road was under construction and finished the following year. In 1930, the section from Skyline Road to PA 18 was paved as well as in Venice. That year the western terminus was moved from Avella to Independence. In 1958, the highway was widened and a median installed at the interchange with the Turnpike. On July 15, 1960, the highways southern terminus was moved from Independence to PA 8 in Etna. The former section of PA 28 from South Main St. in the West End Valley to the intersection of Noblestown Rd. and Crafton Blvd. in Crafton Heights was redesignated as PA 60. The remaining 83-mile stretch from Crafton Heights to Independence was renumbered PA 50. This designation change was made to reduce the number of concurrent routes in Pittsburgh. The changes took effect a few months later and signs were changed by spring 1961. PA 366). In 1963, this section opened to traffic from PA 8 north to the Highland Park Bridge interchange and the following year to Blawnox. Also that year, the Pittsburgh Area Transportation Plan recommended upgrading PA 28 and then PA 8, to a six-lane, limited-access highway starting west of the 31st Street Bridge and ending at the 40th Street Bridge. Full interchanges would be constructed at both bridges; however, this recommendation was not carried out. It also laid out a plan that would turn PA 28 into an expressway from Pittsburgh to Brookville, this too was not carried out. In 1964, the highway was widened and a median installed on it between Brackenridge and the Butler County line. In 1968, construction began on the section from Blawnox to PA 910. The expressway was proposed from that point to the Butler County line. Construction also began on the section from Slate Lick to near Center Hill in the same year. In 1965, the route was moved from Courthouse Road into Kittanning to bypass the borough on its current alignment. In 1969, construction commenced on the section from PA 910 to Exit 12 and from Exit 16 to PA 356 and the Armstrong County line. The start of the 1970s saw the construction extend from Exit 16 all the way to a new expressway alignment for US 422, also under construction, near West Kittanning. In 1971, construction commenced on the section from Exit 15 to Exit 16. In 1972, the expressway opened to traffic from Blawnox to PA 910 and from Exit 15 to US 422. However, PA 28's designation was not placed on the section from Exit 15 to Exit 16. The following year, the expressway opened from PA 910 to Exit 12. In 1973, the route was extended to end at US 19/PA 65 at Chateau Street via Western Avenue and East Ohio Street. In 1975, construction commenced on the section from Exit 12 to north of Tarentum; and during the following year, the construction was extended to Exit 15. In 1978, the PA 28 designation was routed onto the newly opened highway from Exit 11 to Exit 12 and from Exit 15 to Exit 16. The PA 28 designation still followed Freeport Road to connect between Exit 12 and Exit 15. In 1980, the expressway opened from Exit 12 to Exit 13 and the PA 28 designation was moved onto this section. In 1984, the route was changed to follow Western Avenue, Allegheny Avenue, North Shore Drive, General Robinson Street, and Madison Avenue for northbound traffic, and Reedsdale Street for southbound traffic in Pittsburgh. The final section of the Allegheny Valley Expressway between Exit 13 and Exit 15 opened in 1985. During the 1980s, through traffic in each direction at the Highland Park Bridge interchange was reduced to one lane due to heavy demand for the bridge itself. In 2011, the southbound lanes of PA 28 were shifted to bypass the intersection of the 40th Street Bridge, while the northbound lanes remained under the bridge. In 2012, an excavation lowered the roadbed of PA 28 at the 31st Street Bridge. Though technically limited access for its first two miles near downtown Pittsburgh since the 2012 construction, all lanes were clear of lane closures and construction by November, 2014 when Governor Tom Corbett attended the official groundbreaking ceremony to celebrate all 44.5 miles being expressway-grade. The widening included a small park with a promenade and a retaining wall which features several murals on the city's history, including that of the Saint Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church on the aforementioned structure's site.Plaza, historic marker to memorialize St. Nicholas Church in Troy Hill Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (06/15/2015) On December 12, 2017, PennDOT announced that they planned on widening PA 28 at the Highland Park interchange to have two through lanes on each side while having a designated exit and entrance lanes for the bridge, with work scheduled to start in 2020 with some residual work lasting into 2021. The only other thing keeping PA-28 from having the possibility of receiving an interstate designation are the 45-mph speed limits near the Millvale and Etna Exits, as well as the section of the southbound one-lane expressway between Exit 9 (Blawnox Exit), and Exit 8,(Waterworks Exit). If these are ever to be upgraded to Interstate Highway standards, PA 28 will be up to Interstate Highway standards from its southern terminus all the way to Kittanning, and could potentially receive an Interstate designation in the future.PennDOT Plans Improvements To Route 28 At Highland Park Bridge KDKA-TV (12/12/2017) Major intersections PA 28 Truck Pennsylvania Route 28 Truck is a truck route in Brookville, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania. As Route 28 travels through the Brookville city center, it becomes a narrow main street and features a relatively sharp turn just west of the bridge over North Fork Creek. As a result, after the completion of Interstate 80, Route 28's truck traffic was shifted onto this freeway bypass from Exit 78 at Pennsylvania Route 36 (which Truck 28 is cosigned for its first 1/2 mile of existence) to Exit 81, where Route 28 meets the highway.

It is a sub-discipline of project management in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.  History  In the 1970s and 1980s, the software industry grew very quickly, as computer companies quickly recognized the relatively low cost of software production compared to hardware production and circuitry. To manage new development efforts, companies applied the established project management methods, but project schedules slipped during test runs, especially when confusion occurred in the gray zone between the user specifications and the delivered software. To be able to avoid these problems, software project management methods focused on matching user requirements to delivered products, in a method known now as the waterfall model. As the industry has matured, analysis of software project management failures has shown that the following are the most common causes:\\"Why Software Fails\\", in IEEE SpectrumProducing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project (e-book, freely downloadable), by Karl FogelRobert Frese and Vicki Sauter, \\"Improving your odds for software project success,\\" IEEE Engineering Management Review, Vol. 42, No. 4, Fourth Quarter, Dec 2014 # Insufficient end-user involvement # Poor communication among customers, developers, users and project managers # Unrealistic or unarticulated project goals # Inaccurate estimates of needed resources # Badly defined or incomplete system requirements and specifications # Poor reporting of the project's status # Poorly managed risks # Use of immature technology # Inability to handle the project's complexity # Sloppy development practices # Stakeholder politics (e.g. absence of executive support, or politics between the customer and end- users) # Commercial pressures The first five items in the list above show the difficulties articulating the needs of the client in such a way that proper resources can deliver the proper project goals. Specific software project management tools are useful and often necessary, but the true art in software project management is applying the correct method and then using tools to support the method. Without a method, tools are worthless. Since the 1960s, several proprietary software project management methods have been developed by software manufacturers for their own use, while computer consulting firms have also developed similar methods for their clients. Today software project management methods are still evolving, but the current trend leads away from the waterfall model to a more cyclic project delivery model that imitates a software development process.  Software development process  A software development process is concerned primarily with the production aspect of software development, as opposed to the technical aspect, such as software tools. These processes exist primarily for supporting the management of software development, and are generally skewed toward addressing business concerns. Many software development processes can be run in a similar way to general project management processes. Examples are: *Interpersonal communication and conflict management and resolution. Active, frequent and honest communication is the most important factor in increasing the likelihood of project success and mitigating problematic projects. The development team should seek end-user involvement and encourage user input in the development process. Not having users involved can lead to misinterpretation of requirements, insensitivity to changing customer needs, and unrealistic expectations on the part of the client. Software developers, users, project managers, customers and project sponsors need to communicate regularly and frequently. The information gained from these discussions allows the project team to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) and to act on that information to benefit from opportunities and to minimize threats. Even bad news may be good if it is communicated relatively early, because problems can be mitigated if they are not discovered too late. For example, casual conversation with users, team members, and other stakeholders may often surface potential problems sooner than formal meetings. All communications need to be intellectually honest and authentic, and regular, frequent, high quality criticism of development work is necessary, as long as it is provided in a calm, respectful, constructive, non-accusatory, non-angry fashion. Frequent casual communications between developers and end-users, and between project managers and clients, are necessary to keep the project relevant, useful and effective for the end-users, and within the bounds of what can be completed. Effective interpersonal communication and conflict management and resolution are the key to software project management. No methodology or process improvement strategy can overcome serious problems in communication or mismanagement of interpersonal conflict. Moreover, outcomes associated with such methodologies and process improvement strategies are enhanced with better communication. The communication must focus on whether the team understands the project charter and whether the team is making progress towards that goal. End-users, software developers and project managers must frequently ask the elementary, simple questions that help identify problems before they fester into near-disasters. While end-user participation, effective communication and teamwork are not sufficient, they are necessary to ensure a good outcome, and their absence will almost surely lead to a bad outcome.Philip Greenspun, in Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work (2007), * Risk management is the process of measuring or assessing risk and then developing strategies to manage the risk. In general, the strategies employed include transferring the risk to another party, avoiding the risk, reducing the negative effect of the risk, and accepting some or all of the consequences of a particular risk. Risk management in software project management begins with the business case for starting the project, which includes a cost-benefit analysis as well as a list of fallback options for project failure, called a contingency plan. ** A subset of risk management is Opportunity Management, which means the same thing, except that the potential risk outcome will have a positive, rather than a negative impact. Though theoretically handled in the same way, using the term \\"opportunity\\" rather than the somewhat negative term \\"risk\\" helps to keep a team focused on possible positive outcomes of any given risk register in their projects, such as spin-off projects, windfalls, and free extra resources. * Requirements management is the process of identifying, eliciting, documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant stakeholders. New or altered computer system Requirements management, which includes Requirements analysis, is an important part of the software engineering process; whereby business analysts or software developers identify the needs or requirements of a client; having identified these requirements they are then in a position to design a solution. * Change management is the process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, prioritizing and agreeing on changes to scope (project management) and then controlling changes and communicating to relevant stakeholders. Change impact analysis of new or altered scope, which includes Requirements analysis at the change level, is an important part of the software engineering process; whereby business analysts or software developers identify the altered needs or requirements of a client; having identified these requirements they are then in a position to re-design or modify a solution. Theoretically, each change can impact the timeline and budget of a software project, and therefore by definition must include risk-benefit analysis before approval. * Software configuration management is the process of identifying, and documenting the scope itself, which is the software product underway, including all sub- products and changes and enabling communication of these to relevant stakeholders. In general, the processes employed include version control, naming convention (programming), and software archival agreements. * Release management is the process of identifying, documenting, prioritizing and agreeing on releases of software and then controlling the release schedule and communicating to relevant stakeholders. Most software projects have access to three software environments to which software can be released; Development, Test, and Production. In very large projects, where distributed teams need to integrate their work before releasing to users, there will often be more environments for testing, called unit testing, system testing, or integration testing, before release to User acceptance testing (UAT). ** A subset of release management that is gaining attention is Data Management, as obviously the users can only test based on data that they know, and \\"real\\" data is only in the software environment called \\"production\\". In order to test their work, programmers must therefore also often create \\"dummy data\\" or \\"data stubs\\". Traditionally, older versions of a production system were once used for this purpose, but as companies rely more and more on outside contributors for software development, company data may not be released to development teams. In complex environments, datasets may be created that are then migrated across test environments according to a test release schedule, much like the overall software release schedule. *Maintenance and update is the process where Requirements and customer needs are always involving. They will undoubtedly find bugs, may request new features and ask for different functionality and more updates. So, all of these requests need to check and fulfill the customer's requirements and satisfaction.  Project planning, execution, monitoring and control  The purpose of project planning is to identify the scope of the project, estimate the work involved, and create a project schedule. Project planning begins with requirements that define the software to be developed. The project plan is then developed to describe the tasks that will lead to completion. The project execution is the process of completing the tasks defined in the project plan. The purpose of project monitoring and control is to keep the team and management up to date on the project's progress. If the project deviates from the plan, then the project manager can take action to correct the problem. Project monitoring and control involves status meetings to gather status from the team. When changes need to be made, change control is used to keep the products up to date.  Issue  In computing, the term \\"issue\\" is a unit of work to accomplish an improvement in a system. An issue could be a bug, a requested feature, task, missing documentation, and so forth. For example, OpenOffice.org used to call their modified version of Bugzilla IssueZilla. , they call their system Issue Tracker. = Severity levels = Issues are often categorized in terms of severity levels. Different companies have different definitions of severities, but some of the most common ones are: ; High : The bug or issue affects a crucial part of a system, and must be fixed in order for it to resume normal operation. ; Medium : The bug or issue affects a minor part of a system, but has some impact on its operation. This severity level is assigned when a non- central requirement of a system is affected. ; Low / Fixed : The bug or issue affects a minor part of a system, and has very little impact on its operation. This severity level is assigned when a non-central requirement of a system (and with lower importance) is affected. ; Trivial (cosmetic, aesthetic) : The system works correctly, but the appearance does not match the expected one. For example: wrong colors, too much or too little spacing between contents, incorrect font sizes, typos, etc. This is the lowest severity issue. In many software companies, issues are often investigated by quality assurance analysts when they verify a system for correctness, and then assigned to the developer(s) that are responsible for resolving them. They can also be assigned by system users during the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase. Issues are communicated using Issue or Defect Tracking Systems. In some other cases, emails or instant messengers are used.  Philosophy  As a subdiscipline of project management, some regard the management of software development akin to the management of manufacturing, which can be performed by someone with management skills, but no programming skills. John C. Reynolds rebuts this view, and argues that software development is entirely design work, and compares a manager who cannot program to the managing editor of a newspaper who cannot write.John C. Reynolds, Some thoughts on teaching programming and programming languages, SIGPLAN Notices, Volume 43, Issue 11, November 2008, p.108: \\"Some argue that one can manage software production without the ability to program. This belief seems to arise from the mistaken view that software production is a form of manufacturing. But manufacturing is the repeated construction of identical objects, while software production is the construction of unique objects, i.e., the entire process is a form of design. As such it is closer to the production of a newpaper [sic] ‚Äî so that a software manager who cannot program is akin to a managing editor who cannot write.\\"  References  ;General  *  External links  * Resources on Software Project Management from Dan Galorath =Project failure=  ","title":"Software project management"},{"id":"4016719","text":"Bela Vista de Goi√°s is a city located in central Goi√°s state in Brazil.

After her death she became a goddess in Polynesian religion. There are historical and mythological traditions about Nafanua's family and life. She reportedly played a crucial role in the civil wars between the districts of eastern and western Savai‚Äôi. Example of Tiputa (Shirt), similar to the one worn by Nafanua during the wars Life = Family = According to Samoan mythology, she was the daughter of Saveasi'uleo, also considered a demigod, the Ali'i of Pulotu, Coming of Age in American Anthropology: Margaret Mead and Paradise by Malo Pau'po Isaia, p. 39. Pulotu was both a historical place, and a place of the afterlife for the warriors of Samoa (comparable to the Viking concept of Valhalla). In one tradition, Nafanua's mother was Tilafaiga the sister of Taema, the legendary conjoined twins, whom brought the malu tattoo here in Samoa. = Adulthood = Nafanua was bestowed the title of Toa / Toa Tama'ita'i (or Warrior Princess) for avenging her uncle and bringing peace to Savai'i through military victories. Her village was located on the western side of the island of Savai‚Äôi. During Nafanua's time, the eastern and western sides of Savai‚Äôi were engaged in a war for the land and title of the entire island. In Samoan culture, a family is more prestigious if they own a lot of land; and family members (especially males) receive greater titles and a bigger share of the land. According to oral tradition, when High Chief Lilomaiava caught anyone from the east side on the west side of the island, he would force them to climb a coconut tree upside-down as a public punishment One of the villagers that Lilomaiava caught was Ta'i'i, the uncle of Nafanua and the older brother of Saveasi‚Äôuleo. Ta‚Äôi'i was punished and was forced to climb the coconut tree feet first. As he was climbing the coconut tree, the pain and humiliation caused him to sigh loudly. Ta'i'i's sighs were overheard by Saveasi'uleo and Nafanua. This made Savesi‚Äôuleo angry; consequently he told Nafanua to prepare for war and to cut down the Toa tree. The wood from the tree was to be used to make weapons to drive away Lilomaiava and his army. Immediately Nafanua cut down the Toa tree and left it there to dry. A few days later, she returned to the area where the Toa tree was cut and discovered that the tree had attracted many Pule (seashells). \\"E gase toa ae ola pule\\". Literally this means that the shells are living but the Toa tree is dead. But metaphorically speaking, although we have great strength and power as human beings, we do not succeed if we do not have wisdom to make a good, solid decision. It takes courage to make wise decisions. Before leaving for battle Saveasi'uleo ordered Nafanua, \\"A pa'ia le pa i Fu'alaga, a'e le tuli au'a le Ali'i o Aiga\\". This translates to Nafanua being ordered to STOP the killing when she reached the village of Fualaga. Over the course of battle, Nafanua forced the enemy back to the border of their own territory. One tradition holds that she forgot her father's order, and it was only when the wind blew strong enough to lift her tiputa (coverings) that she remembered. The enemy warriors surrendered in shame when they realised that they had been outclassed by a woman. There are a few different interpretations of some of the events, but Nafanua is widely accepted in Polynesia as one of the greatest warriors. After her victory, Nafanua took possession of the four major chiefly titles of the district: Tui Atua, Tui A‚Äòana, Gato‚Äòaitele, and Tamasoali‚Äòi. She therefore established the fa‚Äôamatai (chiefly system of government) that continues in Samoa today. Falealupo In Samoa, the village of Falealupo on the western side of Savai'i is the home of Nafanua.http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3376/features/3217/cure_aids_conservation.html Falealupo is also the site of the entryway into the spirit world Pulotu., Samoa, a Hundred Years Ago and Long Before by George Turner, p.123 Often chiefs from distant villages and islands would come to Falealupo to seek Nafanua's blessings before beginning any military adventure. In 1989, the Chiefs and Orators of Falealupo bestowed the title of Nafanua on ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox for his conservation efforts in protecting the Samoan rainforest.Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest.1997. P. A. Cox. W.H. Freeman, New York The title was formally registered with the Samoan Lands and Title Court. It was in Falealupo, one tradition holds, that Nafanua foretold the coming of Christianity. After years of war, Malietoa Fitisemanu wanted to unite Samoa and end the bloodshed, so he came to Nafanua. After many days, Nafanua prophesied onto Malietoa Fitisemanu, \\"Fa'atali i lagi se ao o lou malo\\" (\\"Wait on the heavens for a crown for your kingdom\\"). In 1830, the missionary John Williams arrived on the shores (matani'u feagaimaleata) of Sapapali'i and brought the bible from his boat into the hands of Malietoa Vainu'upo, the son of Malietoa Fitisemanu. Thus, Malietoa Vainu'upo became known as \\"The King whom Samoa listens to\\". King Malietoa became one of the kings of Samoa and he was instrumental in uniting all of Samoa. These events were considered by many to have fulfilled Nafanua's prophecy.

The league features twenty-five teams in Ontario, one in Quebec, and one in the Akwesasne (which straddles the two aforementioned provinces and New York) that annually play a 20-game schedule and four rounds of playoffs for the J. A. MacDonald Trophy. After the conclusion of the playoffs, a league champion represents the OJBLL at the Founders Cup National Junior B Championship. History Welland Generals player 2014. The Ontario Junior B Lacrosse League of the Ontario Lacrosse Association has been around since at least 1965. The OJBLL compete for the J. A. MacDonald Trophy annually at the provincial level. At the national level, the OJBLL has been extremely dominant at the Founders Cup tournament only losing out to other leagues a handful of times in the last 40+ years. Players from the OJBLL and the Ontario Junior A Lacrosse League are often drafted straight into the professional levels of lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League and Canadian Lacrosse League. Windsor Clippers goalie 2014. The league has changed formats few times in the last few decades. The league has played with no divisions (1990) and with as many as seven (2005). In the past few years, the league has expanded to Oakville, Windsor, London, Cornwall, Hamilton, Niagara, Markham, Orangeville, and Welland. Also, for the 2007 season, the City of Caledon applied to resurrect its old Caledon Bandits franchise, but was offered a spot in the new OLA Junior C Lacrosse League in 2008. Kahnawake Hunters joined the OLA Junior B League in 2009 after not fielding a team in the OLA or Iroquois League for five years. In 2012, the Brampton Excelsiors joined the OJBLL. Clarington Green Gaels had a run between 1998 and 2004 when the Gaels won four Founders Cups Canadian Junior B titles and two J. A. MacDonald Trophy championships. Of the more recent expansion of the league, the Oakville Buzz have been the most remarkable franchise to be built. In 2006, the Buzz team went 19-1 and strolled through the playoffs with little opposition. The Buzz went undefeated at the Founders Cup and crushed the hopes of the host Windsor AKO Fratmen, beating them by a score of 10-4 in the final. Oakville made the jump to Junior A for the 2019 season. Six Nations Rebels dominated the league from 2007 through 2014, winning five league championships (2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013) and six Founders Cups (2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). Orangeville continued the league success at Founders Cup winning back-to-back titles in 2016 and 2017. Elora Mohawks kept the OJBLL streak alive when they captured gold at the 2018 national championship. It would mark the sixth gold medal in the history of the Mohawks.

Draper is best known for the 14 books he completed during his life, including work regarded as seminal on the formative period of the American Communist Party, the Cuban Revolution, and the Iran‚ÄìContra Affair. Draper was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the 1990 recipient of the Herbert Feis Award for Nonacademically Affiliated Historians from the American Historical Association. Biography =Early years= Theodore Draper was born Theodore Dubinsky on September 11, 1912, one of four children.Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, \\"Theodore Draper, Freelance Historian, Is Dead at 93,\\" New York Times, February 22, 2006. His younger brother was Hal Draper, who became a noted Marxist historian. Theodore's parents were ethnic Jews who emigrated to New York City from Ukraine, then part of the Russian empire.Adam Bernstein, \\"Scholar, Historian Theodore Draper,\\" Washington Post, February 23, 2006. His father, Samuel Dubinsky, was the manager of a shirt factory who died in 1924. His mother, Annie Kornblatt Dubinsky, ran a candy store to make ends meet following her husband's death. He was raised in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from the borough's Boys High School. His mother insisted they change the family name to the \\"American-sounding\\" surname \\"Draper\\" when Draper was 20 so that the children could avoid anti-semitism during pursuit of their careers. =Political career= In 1930, Draper enrolled at the College of the City of New York, better known as \\"City College\\".Theodore Draper, \\"Preface\\" to the paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia. New York: Vintage Books, 1986; pg. ix. It was there that he joined the National Student League (NSL), a mass organization of the Communist Party USA targeted at organizing and mobilizing college students. This marked the start of a decade during which Draper chose to remain reliably within the Communist Party's orbit. Draper later recalled: > \\"My initiation came in the National Student League, which I joined in > 1930... Most of its leaders were members of the Young Communist League, but > I was not. I preferred being a 'fellow-traveler,' which was how I came to be > around it. I was enough of a true believer to be convinced that whatever its > faults or shortcomings, only the Communist movement was capable of making > the 'Revolution'; a revolutionary, therefore, had to be close to it. > Nevertheless, I was unwilling to give up a measure of freedom or absence of > discipline, such as I could enjoy as a fellow-traveler.\\" Draper noted that his non-party status \\"may even have helped me, because it could show that one did not have to be a card-carrying Communist to hold a leading position in the NSL.\\"Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. x. Membership did come at a cost, however, as a decision was made by the Communist Party to distribute NSL members from City College, where the organization was strong, to other campuses where the fledgling organization had no presence. Draper was instructed to enroll at the Brooklyn branch of City College, forerunner of Brooklyn College, a decision which he later remembered as \\"one of the saddest days of my life.\\" Draper graduated from Brooklyn College with a B.S. in philosophy in 1933; by this time, the College's National Student League organization \\"was so large and influential that it could virtually close down the school on May Day.\\" Upon graduation he enrolled in the graduate program in history at Columbia University, which he attended for two years without taking a degree.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xi. While attending a social function in 1935, Draper was approached by Harry Gannes, the foreign editor of the Communist Party's newspaper, The Daily Worker. The editor asked Ted whether he would be willing to put his prospective academic career aside and to instead come to work at the paper as his assistant. After giving the matter careful consideration, Draper decided to accept the offer and went to work at the Daily Worker, where he remained for two years as assistant foreign editor, writing for publication under the name Theodore Repard.Note that \\"Repard\\" is \\"Draper\\" spelled backwards. In the summer of 1936 Draper was tapped to go to Moscow as the Daily Worker's correspondent there. He was ready to travel to Russia when he was suddenly told he couldn't leave because the party had learned that his brother, Hal Draper, was a Trotskyist, causing Soviet authorities to regard Ted as a security risk. The position of Moscow correspondent was subsequently offered to another Daily Worker journalist. In 1937, Draper moved to the Communist Party's literary-artistic weekly, The New Masses, where he took a position as foreign editor and wrote for publication under his real name. The magazine sent Draper to Europe in 1938 to cover the tense geopolitical situation there. Draper spent time in Paris, in Czechoslovakia covering the crisis which led to the \\"Munich Agreement\\" between Adolf Hitler and Neville Chamberlain, and in Spain covering the last days of the Spanish Civil War. Upon returning from Europe in 1939, Draper was approached by a new fellow- traveling publishing house called Modern Age Publishers with an offer for Ted to write a book on the European political situation. Draper used the book advance as an excuse to quit The New Masses and he headed for Paris to conduct further research.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pp. xi-xii. Draper returned to the United States in November 1939, but the changing political situation ‚Äî and the changing political line of the Communist Party in response to this ‚Äî ultimately scrapped Draper's book project despite multiple re-writes.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xii. Throughout 1939 and 1940 Draper continued to periodically write for the New Masses on various topics at the request of the editors. With France falling to Nazi Germany in the summer of 1940, Draper was urgently requested to contribute an article for publication on the significance of the event. An article entitled \\"New Moment in France\\" was produced and published in the July 9, 1940 issue, in which Draper argued that the French collapse had altered the balance of power in Europe and hinted that the Soviet Union would be a likely next target of the Nazis in their pursuit of \\"an ever widening circle of expansion for easy booty.\\"Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pp. xii-xiii. Draper remembered: > \\"The article was delivered just before the deadline and must have gone in > without much editorial deliberation. With everyone stunned by the French > debacle, and no party line on it immediately established, my article had > squeaked through. I was asked to write another article on the same subject > for the following issue and attempted to say the same thing in even stronger > form. But this time the party line caught up with me as a result of word > from Moscow. The Soviet press let it be known that nothing had changed, > there were no new problems or new conditions, no 'new moment in Europe.'... > My second article was never published. It was the first time that any > article of mine had been rejected. I was suddenly faced with the kind of > personal political crisis that so many had confronted before and were to > confront afterwards.\\"Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American > Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xiii. Draper refused to write any more articles for the New Masses after that date, limiting himself to a few book reviews so as to avoid a total severing of connections with the Communist movement.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xiv. He also spent a six-month stint as correspondent for the Soviet news agency TASS, before joining the staff of a short-lived French language weekly newspaper based in New York City. Despite being invited back into the fold after the June 1941 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union validated his earlier prognostications, Draper felt this impossible and instead worked at a series of temporary jobs to make ends meet. In 1943, Draper was inducted into the U.S. Army and was thereby \\"saved from thinking any more about American Communism, at least for the next three years.\\"Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pp. xiv-xv. Draper was put to work in the Historical Section of the 84th Infantry Division, ultimately writing the Division's official history of its activities during the Battle of the Ardennes in World War II.Sgt. Theodore Draper, The 84th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Ardennes, December 1944-January 1945, Liege, Belgium: Historical Section, 84th Infantry Division, April 1945. In 1944 Draper also saw the publication at last of a book on French affairs, when mainstream publisher The Viking Press released a book by Draper called The Six Weeks' War.Theodore Draper, The Six Weeks' War: France, May 10 - June 25, 1940. New York: Viking Press, 1944. Draper's transition from a political journalist to a historian had begun. =Historian= Following World War II, Draper worked as a freelance journalist, writing extensively for Commentary magazine, a new publication of the American Jewish Committee, among other publications. In 1950 he began to write for a new bi-weekly news magazine called The Reporter, founded by Max Ascoli. Such writing tasks did not constitute full-time work, however, leaving time for Draper to engage in other literary pursuits. With the growth of McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare, the subject of communism in America began to loom large in the public consciousness. Draper began to think of writing a \\"traditional\\" history of the American Communist Party based upon documentary sources and meeting scholarly standards and slowly began work on the project in his spare time.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xv. He was set free to work on the task full-time in 1952 by a grant from the newly established Fund for the Republic, set up as an autonomous organization by the Ford Foundation.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xvi. Under the direction of political scientist Clinton Rossiter of Cornell University, the Fund for the Republic determined to publish a full-scale history of American communism. David A. Shannon of the University of Wisconsin was tapped to write the history of the CPUSA during the post-war period, while Draper was chosen to produce a monograph on the party's early years. Robert W. Iverson wrote The Communists and the Schools (1959) in that series Rossiter allowed Draper two years to complete the entire project, the history of American communism from its origins in 1919 until the sacking of party leader Earl Browder at the end of World War II. Draper set to work, mustering sources and conducting interviews with living participants of the formative period of the American Communist Party. One of those with whom he conducted an extensive correspondence was James P. \\"Jim\\" Cannon, a midwesterner who was sacked from the organization in 1928 for supporting Leon Trotsky and the Russian \\"Left Opposition.\\" Draper noted that Cannon's letters soon became \\"more formal, better organized, each a little gem of its kind.\\"Theodore Draper, \\"Preface\\" to The First Ten Years of American Communism. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1962. These letters of Jim Cannon to Ted Draper were ultimately published in book form as The First Ten Years of American Communism in 1962.James P. Cannon, The First Ten Years of American Communism. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1962. In the meantime, Draper finished his book for Rossiter and the Fund for the Republic: > \\"Two years later, I finished a book, but not the book.... I woke up one day > to realize that I had written a book which ended in 1923, a turning-point in > the story.... I was faced with a problem; 1923 was too far from 1945 to make > up a plausible alibi. I could not expect anyone else to know what the > significance of 1923 was and why it had become my stopping-point. Yet, > somehow, without intending it, I had produced a book on the formative period > of the formative period; it had a beginning, a middle, and an end; it was a > book I knew, if the wrong one.\\"Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of > American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xvii. Draper turned in the manuscript to Cinton Rossiter, who was irate about the truncation of the narrative but was in great need of a publication to show that the Fund for the Republic project was alive and functioning. The manuscript thus found print without revision as The Roots of American Communism in 1957 and Rossiter set Draper back to work for two more years to complete the rest of the assigned time period.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xviii. To his own dismay, Draper repeated the stunt, terminating the second volume with the 1929 expulsion of party leader Jay Lovestone and his co-thinkers. Again Clinton Rossiter protested and published, with the Viking Press releasing the volume as American Communism and Soviet Russia in 1960. A third volume was planned, for which Draper began assembling research material. Unfortunately, by this time the Fund for the Republic had run out of money and the story of the American Communist Party during the decade of the 1930s was left to be told by another writer at a later date.Draper, \\"Preface\\" to paperback edition of American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. xix. After several tries and failures to complete the task, Draper turned his research material over to a young scholar whose work he appreciated, Harvey Klehr of Emory University. Klehr's book, which made use of Draper's research material but to which Draper did not himself personally contribute, was ultimately published in 1984.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984. With his scholarly funding dried up and his interests shifting, Draper next moved to the hot-button topic of the Cuban Revolution as a focus for his scholarship. A series of articles, books, and pamphlets ensued, marked by the 1962 tome Castro's Revolution: Myths and Realities, published by Frederick A. Praeger publishers. Draper's work as a historian of the Cuban Revolution brought him to the attention of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, an anti-communist think tank located at Stanford University. Draper accepted a Hoover Institution fellowship and remained there until 1968, at which time he departed, ill at ease with the growing conservatism of the institution. Draper moved across country to accept a similar post at the Institute for Advanced Study located at Princeton University, where he focused his scholarship on the question of race relations. Draper was a long-time contributor first to the magazine Commentary and later to the New York Review of Books.Theodore Draper, \\"Introduction to the Transaction edition\\" in The Roots of American Communism, Transaction Publishers, 2003 Some of Draper's later works include A Very Thin Line, a history of the Iran-Contra Affair, and A Struggle for Power, a monograph on the economic and political circumstances behind the American Revolution of 1776. =Death and legacy= Theodore Draper died on February 21, 2006, at his home in Princeton, New Jersey. He was 93 years old at the time of his death. Draper's papers are housed in two locations.

The UK's Midland Main Line being upgraded in 2014. The structure gauge, also called the minimum clearance outline, is the minimum height and width of tunnels and bridges as well as the minimum height and width of the doors that allow a rail siding access into a warehouse. In addition, the term may apply to the minimum distance to railway platforms (passenger or freight), buildings, electrical equipment boxes, railway signal equipment, third rails or to supports for overhead lines from the track. The width of a narrow cut can also affect the maximum loading gauge. The difference between the structure gauge and the loading gauge is called the \\"clearance\\". The amount of clearance between the loading gauge and the structure gauge depends on the speed of the train, due to the train wobbling, so a train may be able to get past a restricted clearance by travelling at slow speed. The term can also be applied to the minimum size of road tunnels, overpasses and bridges, as well as doors into automobile repair shops, bus garages, filling stations, residential garages, multi-storey car parks and warehouses. Accidents A high bridge near St Petersburg is known as the \\"Bridge of Stupidity\\" because it is often struck by vehicles despite many warning signs. In May 2018, after it was struck for the 150th time by a GAZelle truck, a birthday cake was presented to the bridge. This made national news.

Here the Pochhammer symbol (q)i indicates the i-th rising factorial of q, i.e. :(q)_i = q\\\\,(q+1) \\\\cdots (q+i-1) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(q+i)}{\\\\Gamma(q)}~, where the second equality is true for all complex q except q=0,-1,-2,\\\\ldots. These functions can be extended to other values of the variables x1, x2, x3 by means of analytic continuation. Lauricella also indicated the existence of ten other hypergeometric functions of three variables. These were named FE, FF, ..., FT and studied by Shanti Saran in 1954 . There are therefore a total of 14 Lauricella‚ÄìSaran hypergeometric functions. Generalization to n variables These functions can be straightforwardly extended to n variables. One writes for example : F_A^{(n)}(a, b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n, c_1,\\\\ldots,c_n; x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\ldots,i_n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(a)_{i_1+\\\\ldots+i_n} (b_1)_{i_1} \\\\cdots (b_n)_{i_n}} {(c_1)_{i_1} \\\\cdots (c_n)_{i_n} \\\\,i_1! \\\\cdots \\\\,i_n!} \\\\,x_1^{i_1} \\\\cdots x_n^{i_n} ~, where |x1+ ... + |xn< 1\\\\. These generalized series too are sometimes referred to as Lauricella functions. When n = 2, the Lauricella functions correspond to the Appell hypergeometric series of two variables: : F_A^{(2)} \\\\equiv F_2 ,\\\\quad F_B^{(2)} \\\\equiv F_3 ,\\\\quad F_C^{(2)} \\\\equiv F_4 ,\\\\quad F_D^{(2)} \\\\equiv F_1. When n = 1, all four functions reduce to the Gauss hypergeometric function: : F_A^{(1)}(a,b,c;x) \\\\equiv F_B^{(1)}(a,b,c;x) \\\\equiv F_C^{(1)}(a,b,c;x) \\\\equiv F_D^{(1)}(a,b,c;x) \\\\equiv {_2}F_1(a,b;c;x). Integral representation of FD In analogy with Appell's function F1, Lauricella's FD can be written as a one-dimensional Euler-type integral for any number n of variables: : F_D^{(n)}(a, b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n, c; x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(c)} {\\\\Gamma(a) \\\\Gamma(c-a)} \\\\int_0^1 t^{a-1} (1-t)^{c-a-1} (1-x_1t)^{-b_1} \\\\cdots (1-x_nt)^{-b_n} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t, \\\\qquad \\\\operatorname{Re} c > \\\\operatorname{Re} a > 0 ~. This representation can be easily verified by means of Taylor expansion of the integrand, followed by termwise integration. The representation implies that the incomplete elliptic integral Œ† is a special case of Lauricella's function FD with three variables: : \\\\Pi(n,\\\\phi,k) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\phi} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta} {(1 - n \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta) \\\\sqrt{1 - k^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta}} = \\\\sin (\\\\phi) \\\\,F_D^{(3)}(\\\\tfrac 1 2, 1, \\\\tfrac 1 2, \\\\tfrac 1 2, \\\\tfrac 3 2; n \\\\sin^2 \\\\phi, \\\\sin^2 \\\\phi, k^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\phi), \\\\qquad |\\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\phi< \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} ~. Finite-sum solutions of FD Case 1 : a>c, a-c integer One can relate FD to the Carlson R function R_n via F_D(a,\\\\overline{b},c,\\\\overline{z})=R_{a-c}(\\\\overline{b^*}, \\\\overline{z^*}) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_i (z_i^*)^{b_i^*} = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(a-c+1)\\\\Gamma(b^*)}{\\\\Gamma(a-c+b^*)} \\\\cdot D_{a-c}(\\\\overline{b^*}, \\\\overline{z^*}) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_i (z_i^*)^{b_i^*} with the iterative sum D_n(\\\\overline{b^*}, \\\\overline{z^*})=\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i^* \\\\cdot (z_i^*)^k\\\\right) \\\\cdot D_{k-i} and D_0=1 where it can be exploited that the Carlson R function with n>0 has an exact representation (see for more information).

The park was created in 1859 when the Museum Gardens were laid out adjacent to the newly built Free Museum and Library. The park has since been extended in stages and now forms of open parkland in the city centre. The park is located in the northwest of the city centre and to the west of the Cathedral Close across the road from the Garden of Remembrance. The majority of the park was originally waterlogged marshland and a lake covered the area of what is now the Museum Gardens. The land was drained in the early 19th century and the Museum Gardens were raised with silt dredged from Minster Pool. The large northern area of the park once formed the land and gardens of Beacon House. This land was incorporated into the park when the owner of Beacon House, Colonel Swinfen Broun, donated the land after his death. The park has many sporting and recreational facilities for use by the public, including an 18 hole golf course, football pitches, tennis courts and bowling greens. The park also hosts a wide range of events throughout the year including the Lichfield Bower and The Lichfield Festival. The park is home to many monuments, most notably a large bronze statue of Captain Smith of the RMS Titanic. History =Early history= Bishops Fish Pool in 1842, over the location of the present Museum Gardens. Beacon Park stands on land which was originally low lying, poorly drained pasture alongside the Leamonsley Brook. The Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds were the site of Bishops Fish Pool (sometimes known as Upper Pool). The pool was created when a causeway was built on Beacon Street in the 14th century separating it from Minster Pool. The waterlogged marshland surrounding Bishops Fish Pool became known as 'The Moggs' from the 15th century and later 'Swan Moggs'. Swans were kept by the Bishops of Lichfield on Bishops Fish Pool from the early 14th century. Special pens and nesting areas were constructed. Ownership of the birds passed to the Lichfield Corporation from 1548. In 1704 the lease owner of 'Swan Moggs' was required to allow the swans make their nests there. In this area today we get the street names Swan Road and Swan Mews reflecting the history of the land use. The land of the wider Beacon Park was used for agriculture from at least the 13th century to the 19th century. This past use is visible today in street names with Townfields south of the park and north of the park there are records of a Shaw field in 1336 which is now Shaw Lane. =19th century= The bandstand, which was once at the southern end of the Museum Gardens. As the city water supply from Aldershawe was diminishing in the early 19th century, money was spent diverting surface waters from 'Swan Moggs' into a common conduit. The two streams across it were diverted into underground culverts; the land was raised with silt and mud dredged from Minster Pool. The area was subsequently developed into the formal gardens of Beacon Park by the Lichfield Corporation, but paid for by the Conduit Lands Trust. The Museum Gardens were opened in 1859 to complement the new Italianate Free Library and Museum. The Recreation Grounds, opened in 1891, is the small area between the Museum Gardens and the wider Beacon Park. The central fountain was unveiled as the central focus of the Museum Gardens in 1871. A bandstand was also installed close to the junction of the Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds, and was positioned to provide a focus for the avenue through the Museum Gardens. The development of the wider Beacon Park is closely linked to the development of Beacon House, which was built for George Hand in 1800. The gardens and parkland were developed in stages over the nineteenth century as ownership of the estate changed. In 1826 the owner, Richard Hinckley added two wings to the house, extended the grounds and carried out extensive improvements to the landscape. Two fish ponds were dug along the valley, fed by the Leomonsley Brook, and a long ornamental approach constructed across the fields towards Walsall Road. Samuel Lipscomb Seckham acquired Beacon House and its estate in 1880. He extended the parkland to cover and added a terraced walk along the front; linking the house to the ponds. =20th century= Chancellor Law's Fountain after restoration in 2011 Statues of Edward VII and Edward Smith were erected in the Museum Gardens in 1908 and 1914 respectively. During the First World War, Beacon House was sold to the War department. A Crimean War cannon and a First World War German gun were placed in the Museum Gardens after the war, only to be removed for scrap metal during the next war. After the First World War the park was the scene of much celebration with the Recreation Grounds used for athletics and the Museum Gardens for dancing. The Garden of Remembrance was laid out across Beacon Street opposite the park in 1920. The timber framed public convenience at the northeast entrance was built in 1930, partly with old materials from the portion of the Friary which was taken down in 1925 on the making of the new road. Beacon House was used by the Royal Army Service Corps during the Second World War before being demolished by the City Council in 1964. The land on which Beacon House once stood is now a housing estate with street names Swinfen Broun Road and Seckham Road named after previous residents of the house. Colonel Swinfen Broun gifted of the land to the park in 1943. After the land attached to Beacon House was incorporated into Beacon Park between 1943 and 1964 the park area as we know it today was complete. Over the rest of the 20th century many recreation facilities were incorporated into the park. Parkland was levelled for football pitches in 1947. A second bowling green in the Recreation Grounds was laid out by the City Council in 1962 to join the green in the Museum Gardens laid in 1922. In 1972 the two fish ponds were reshaped and deepened to leave one pool (Beacon Pool) we see today. The golf course was laid out and opened in 1973. =21st century= In 2009, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund announced Beacon Park, Minster Pool and Walk and the Garden of Remembrance had been awarded a grant ¬£3.9 million under the 'Parks for People' programme. The transformation started in 2010 and was completed in 2012 with works including a new caf√©, refreshment kiosk, bowls and education pavilion, toilets, and new and improved play areas for children of all ages. Conservation work was carried out on the listed structures, including the statues, railings and fountain. In the Museum Gardens, the bowling green was relocated to the Recreation Grounds and in its previous location beds of flowers were planted to recreate the Victorian geometric landscaping to the gardens.

The disputed story of 999 Christian martyrs who were killed by the Romans under pagan Emperor Diocletian in Lichfield in 288 CE is depicted in the stonework of the monument. It was located on the front of the Guildhall until, in 1744 during the Victorian restoration of the Guildhall the plaque was taken down a placed in storage. It emerged again in 1864, when it was moved to a rockery on the eastern side of the Museum Gardens. It lay in the rockery falling into a state of disrepair until 2010 when it was restored and relocated onto a plinth in the Recreation Grounds. The seal can also be seen on the railway bridge at St John's Street. *Chancellor Law's Fountain ‚Äì Unveiled in May 1871, the fountain was sculpted by Turner and Allen of London. The lions are made from Ashlar stone and the central figure is sculpted iron. The fountain was a gift from James Thomas Law who was the chancellor of the diocese and gave much to the city, including the statue of Samuel Johnson in the market square. The fountain is located at the centre of the Museum Gardens. In 2011 the fountain was restored with funding from Lichfield Conduit Lands Trust. King Edward VII *King Edward VII ‚Äì Unveiled in September 1908 the statue was sculpted by local stonemason George Lowther of Robert Bridgeman & Sons of Lichfield. The pedestal is made of Hoptonwood stone and the figure from Portland stone. Edward is portrayed in full coronation robes with a sceptre in his right hand. The arms of the City of Lichfield are on the front of the pedestal. The statue was erected during Edward's reign as a gesture of the city's loyalty to the King. The statue is located on the eastern end of the Museum Gardens. The statue was rededicated on 24 April 2013 by The Princess Royal. *Captain Edward Smith ‚Äì Unveiled in July 1914 at the western end of the Museum Gardens, the statue was sculpted by Kathleen Scott, wife of Antarctic explorer Robert Scott. The pedestal is made from Cornish granite and the figure is bronze. This is a memorial to the captain of the RMS Titanic, which sank on 15 April 1912. Captain Smith was from Hanley and Lichfield was chosen as the location for the monument because Smith was a Staffordshire man and Lichfield was the centre of the diocese. The statue originally cost ¬£740 raised through local and national contributions. In 2010, as part of the 'Parks for People' programme, the statue was restored and the green patina removed from its surface at a cost of ¬£16,000. In 2011 an unsuccessful campaign was started to get the statue moved back to Captain Smith's home town of Hanley. *Colonel Swinfen Broun ‚Äì Unveiled in September 1972, the memorial is a 1.9m high sandstone brick with two bronze plaques located on each side. In 1948 Lichfield mourned the loss of one of its most generous benefactors, Colonel Swinfen Broun. He had paid a large part of the cost of Victoria Hospital, given the Guildhall its clock and donated of recreational land to Beacon Park in 1943. In his will he also left half of his estate at Swinfen Hall to Lichfield Cathedral and the other half to the Lichfield Corporation. A memorial was set up on the west bank of Beacon Pool after his death in recognition to his contribution to the city. *Erasmus Darwin ‚Äì Unveiled on 12 December 2012, a high bronze statue of Erasmus Darwin sculpted by Peter Walker. The statue was estimated to cost ¬£61,500 with 30% of the funds to come from Section 106 funding. The statue is located near to the Bird Street entrance to the Museum Gardens. Recreational uses Classic Cars on display at 'Cars In The Park'The park has many sporting facilities including flat and crown bowling greens in the recreation grounds. The Lichfield Museum Bowling Club has been playing on the greens since 1922 and is one of the oldest bowling clubs in the country. There are four asphalt surfaced tennis courts built in 1932, six football pitches (seasonal), a basketball court, a cricket pitch (seasonal) and an eighteen hole public golf course. In addition to sports, other recreational facilities are available. These include a crazy golf course, a young children's playground and an older children's playground. During the summer season activities such as canoeing on Beacon Pool, donkey rides, giant board games and a bouncy castle are available in the park. Two new catering facilities in the park opened in May 2012. The Lakeside Bistro near Beacon Pool and Chandlers Caf√© at the Bird Street entrance to the park were built as part of the works following the ¬£3.9 million grant and Chandlers Group spent ¬£200,000 fitting out the new facilities. Entertainment uses The park is used as a venue for many entertainment events throughout the year. The Lichfield bower and the Lichfield Festival hold events in the park annually, during the summer. 'Cars in the Park' takes place annually at the end of June. First held in 1997, 'Cars in the Park' showcases more than 1,000 vintage and modern cars and 62 car clubs took part in the 2011 event. Lichfield Proms in the Park, an open air classical music event, takes place annually on the first Saturday of September. A big top Circus also comes to the park annually in Spring.

Signatures Restaurant was a Washington D.C. restaurant opened by Jack Abramoff. Expensive and lavishly appointed with expensive memorabilia, Villeroy & Boch chargers and Christofle flatware, Signatures was used by Abramoff in coordination with his skyboxes and foreign trips to spend money primarily given by Indian tribes on politicians. During 17 months between 2002 and 2003 Signatures gave away $180,000 of food and drinks. Signatures rivaled the Capital Grille, opened in 1994, as the premier high-end GOP restaurant in town. It was more successful than Abramoff's other Washington D.C. food ventures: Archives Restaurant and Stacks Delicatessen, both kosher eateries. The political website PoliticsPA named it to their list of restaurants frequented by politicians. Abramoff's scandalous dealings Abramoff billed his tribal clients hundreds of thousands of dollars for meals at Signatures. Billing, campaign finance records, and restaurant records show, for example, that the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians paid Greenberg Traurig over $5,600, and that the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians paid as much as $20,000 for dozens of luncheon and dinner events a month. Abramoff's preferred table was Table 40, where Tom DeLay, Dana Rohrabacher, Bob Ney, and John Doolittle were his regular guests, getting their meals comped. Rohrabacher ate as Abramoff's guest at least monthly, claiming the friendship exemption to House ethics rules. Bob Ney paid Signatures about $1,900 for meals and events between 2002 and 2004 in addition to many comped meals. Restaurant records show that Team Abramoff members Neil Volz and Tony Rudy (with Tom Hammond) organized $1,500 (minimum) dinners for their respective former bosses, Bob Ney and Tom DeLay, in April 2002, though campaign finance records show no payment. Although representatives Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Frank A. LoBiondo (R-N.J.) and former senators John Breaux (D-La.), Don Nickles (R) and Tim Hutchinson (R) were also on an Abramoff list of people to be comped, Blunt, LoBiondo, and Breaux deny ever receiving free meals. Over the period of January 2002 to May 2003 Abramoff and his investors put more than $3 million into Signatures, spending 7 percent of revenues on comped food and drink, well above the industry standard. Who's who and featured memorabilia The official owner of Signatures was Livsar Enterprises, with Rodney Lane acting as the CEO. The registered agent was lawyer Yale Ginsburg; lawyer Jay Kaplan led the Signatures restaurant group. According to emails sent by Abramoff in 2001, Capitol Campaign Strategies transferred money to Livsar, which he planned to have under the control of his wife Pamela. Signatures was built by John S. Hillery & Assoc. Const. Inc of Sterling, Va. at a cost of $850,000.00. The original chefs were executive chef Michael Rosen and sous-chef Jeff Ramsey. In 2006, the executive chef was Morou Ouattara. The main dining room seated 104 (50 seats at the bar), and about 50 on the patio. The private dining rooms seated 15 and 25 people. Amenities included rentable wine lockers and an in- house humidor. The restaurant featured rare document collections of Stan Klos and Edward Bomsey, as well as other political memorabilia. The documents on display featured famous autographs. Most of the items displayed were also for sale. Some of the memorabilia featured included a rocking chair used by John F. Kennedy ($495,000), a signed replica of Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon (sold for $5,000), and signed portraits, letters, and photos of Czar Nicholas, Winston Churchill, Gen. George Patton, Rocky Marciano, Harry Houdini, Thomas Edison and Meyer Lansky ($5,000-$10,000).

It is generally served in cabanes √† sucre (sugar shacks) in spring time, as a salty and crunchy side contrasting with maple syrup-laden foods.  Origin  The strange expression is thought to have originated in a lumber camp on the Saint-Maurice River. A brawler named Christ, after a couple of fights, had his ear swell like a cauliflower. Because of the similarity between the cauliflower ear and the fried pork jowl, he was made fun of by a cook. The cook said \\"Qui veut des oreilles du grand Christ?\\", which means \\"Who wants the ears of big Christ?\\".  Etymology  The word crisse derives from \\"Christ\\" written phonetically in the Qu√©b√©cois dialect, and is arguably the strongest Quebec French profanity. Though not directly translatable, it is most often used in the same sense as fuck is in English. Profanity is used elsewhere as a mark of excellence in Qu√©b√©cois cuisine, as with pets de s≈ìurs.

Aiso was the Director and head instructor of the Military Intelligence Service Language School, and the highest-ranking Japanese American in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was also the first Japanese American appointed as a judge in the contiguous United States.California Courts, \\"John F. Aiso biography\\" Early life Born in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank, Aiso was an excellent student, despite encounters with anti-Japanese prejudice. He later described one of his first memories as being called a \\"Jap\\" by an elderly woman on a streetcar, explaining the amount of effort he put into his schoolwork was largely to counteract such comments. He was elected student body president of his junior high school in 1922, but the victory proved to be short lived: parents protested a Japanese American holding the position, and student government was suspended until Aiso left the school. He went on to attend Hollywood High School, where he drew national attention when he won the school's oratorical competition on the U.S. Constitution in 1926. However, he was once again forced to step down, when he was told he could not compete at the national championship and would instead have to coach his runner up. Education and career After graduating at the top of his Hollywood High School class in 1926, Aiso spent a year in Japan, studying Japanese at Seijo University in Tokyo. He returned to the United States after receiving a scholarship to attend Brown University, where he captained the debate team and majored in economics, graduating cum laude and serving as class valedictorian in 1931. He continued his studies at Harvard Law School, completing his degree in 1934.Japanese American Veterans Association. \\"Hall of Famers: Col. John F. Aiso, Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame (1991).\\" Retrieved 10 November 2014. Between 1935 and 1952, he worked in private practice in Los Angeles and New York. In 1936, he spent another year in Tokyo, working with Japanese banks on behalf of his U.S. law firm, and while there he studied Japanese law at Chuo University. From 1937 to 1940, he worked for the British American Tobacco Company in Japanese-occupied Manchuria. After his return to the United States, Aiso was drafted into the army, reporting for active duty in April 1941. Originally stationed at Fort MacArthur, Aiso was assigned to menial tasks due to discrimination, and was working in the motor pool when his proficiency in the Japanese language was recognized by Fourth Army G-2 officer, Capt. Kai E. Rasmussen, who was tasked with developing a Japanese language school, and transferred Aiso to the hastily formed (and, at first, secret) Military Intelligence Service Language School (MISLS). Recruited by MISLS head Lt Col John Weckerling as an instructor at the school, Aiso, then a Private First Class, couldn't be expected to teach officers, and Japanese Americans were prohibited from being commissioned at the time, so he was to be discharged, transferred to Reserve service, and hired as a War Department Civilian. Aiso distinguished himself in his role, earning praise from his commanders and his fellow instructors, and was soon appointed the Director of Academic Training, a position normally held by a Lieutenant Colonel. When the Chief of Army Intelligence, Gen Clayton Lawrence Bissell, visited the school in 1944, he was outraged that a civilian was placed in command of military personnel, and went back to Washington to demand a direct commission for Aiso to Major. In this position, he became the highest-ranking Japanese American in the United States Army during the Second World War, eventually separating from active duty with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Under his inspiring leadership as director of academic training, the MISLS rapidly expanded. He recruited and trained a staff of over 150, developed course materials, and set the highest academic standards. The more than 6,000 graduates contributed immeasurably to the American victory over Imperial Japan and to winning the peace that followed.Ano, Masaharu. \\"Loyal Linguists: Nisei of World War II Learned Japanese in Minnesota ,\\" Minnesota History Quarterly, Fall 1977 (45:7), pp 273-87. (General Charles Willoughby credited Aiso's MIS graduates with shortening the war by two years and saving close to a million lives.) After the Allied victory in August 1945, Aiso refocused the MISLS curriculum to prepare students for roles in the occupation of Japan. In January 1946, he would transfer to Gen Douglas MacArthur's staff as a legal assistant under MacArthur's G-2 chief, Gen Charles A. Willoughby, working in the investigation and enforcement of the political purge dictated by the Potsdam Declaration. Aiso was released from active duty and returned to Los Angeles in February 1947, returning to private law practice . He would later be promoted to a colonel in the Army Reserve, before retiring in 1965. In 1950, he received an honorary master's degree from Brown University.\\"Honorary Degrees,\\" from Martha Mitchell's Encyclopedia Brunoniana In 1952, he served as a Commissioner for one year. Aiso was then appointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1953, where he served until he was elevated to the Los Angeles Superior Court in 1957. He was the first Japanese American to enter the California State Judiciary when then Governor Ronald Reagan appointed Aiso as an Associate Justice of the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, on November 4, 1968. Awards and accolades President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded him the Legion of Merit in 1965 for his service during World War II. In 1984, the Emperor of Japan awarded him the 3rd Class Order of the Rising Sun for his contributions to understanding and friendship between the United States and Japan. He was inducted into the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame in 1991. The Aiso Library at the Defense Language Institute (DLI) Foreign Language Center is named in his honor for his contributions as the chief instructor of MISLS, the predecessor of DLI. In the Little Tokyo community of Los Angeles, a one-block segment of San Pedro Street between Temple Boulevard and 1st Street has been renamed Judge John Aiso Street in his honor. Death John Aiso died December 29, 1987, from a head injury sustained in an attempted mugging.

Biography Accompanying his uncle, Ygnacio Coronel, he came to California in 1834 as a member of the H√≠jar-Padr√©s Colony. In 1842, Olvera married Concepci√≥n Arg√ºello (1815-1853), daughter of Santiago Arg√ºello. After her death, Olvera married in 1859 Maria Ortega (1823‚Äì1918), widow of Edward Stokes. Olvera held various offices in the Mexican administration. Olvera was granted Rancho Mission Viejo in 1842 and the Rancho Cuyamaca in 1845. Olvera helped to bridge the gap between the governance of California by Mexico and the United States. Olvera later served as captain in Flores' campaign against Fr√©mont and was one of the commission of three that negotiated peace with the American forces at Cahuenga. As a commissioner he signed the Treaty of Cahuenga ending the war in California. U.S. Military Governor Bennet Riley appointed Olvera to be Judge of the First Instance in 1849. Augustin Olvera was subsequently elected the first county judge of the newly formed County of Los Angeles in 1850.

Along with his legal duties, Olvera was responsible, with his two associate justices, for administering county business until the establishment of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors two years later.

One of his clerks was Buron Fitts, later the Los Angeles County district attorney. Rogers appeared for the defense in 77 murder trials and lost only three . He astonished medical experts on the witness stand with his technical questions . His expertise was so complete that he became a professor of medical jurisprudence and insanity in the College of Physicians and Surgeons as well as a professor at the University of Southern California Law School.

Mootry from a charge of murdering his wife by appealing to the jurors' own feelings about their wives.

Clark Company, 2001, p. 63. =The Catalina Island murder 1902= Rogers is also remembered for the defense in the Catalina Island murder case. In the early morning of August 13, 1902 at the Metropole Hotel, a gambler, William A. Yeagar, better known as \\"the Louisville Sport,\\" was murdered during a card game. Alfred Boyd was one of three men in the room playing poker. Harry Johnson, who was at the table, ran from the room, yelling \\"He shot him, he shot him!\\" and handed Boyd's gun to bartender Jim Davis, who thought that there was no question that Boyd was the killer. Boyd was charged with the murder, but Rogers won an acquittal.. =Griffith J. Griffith, 1903= Colonel Griffith J.

He was convicted of the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon and served two years in prison. =Morrison Buck, 1906= In 1906, Rogers made one of his rare appearances for the prosecution and used his medical expertise to send Morris Buck to the gallows for the murder of Chloe Canfield, wife of Charles A. Canfield (1848-1913).Cecilia Rasmussen, Tale of Wealth, Murder and a Family's Decline, The Los Angeles Times, August 20, 2000 =Patrick Calhoun 1909= Patrick Calhoun, president of the United Railroad Company, was charged with bribing the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in exchange for granting the overhead trolley franchise to his company in the wake of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Rogers defended Calhoun, but during his trials and all the related trials of United Railroad Company's general counsel, Tiery Ford, Rogers did not call a single witness nor introduce any evidence, arguing that the prosecution simply hadn't made a case against the defendants. On June 20, 1909, the Calhoun jury was deadlocked, with the final jury vote at ten for acquittal and two for conviction. He was not retried. =Clarence Darrow, 1912-1913= Perhaps the most famous lawyer-client disagreements recorded in legal history were those which developed between Clarence Darrow, indicted for attempted jury bribery in Los Angeles in 1912, and Earl Rogers. The case arose out of Darrow‚Äôs defense of the McNamara brothers, labor leaders who were indicted in the 1910 dynamiting of the Los Angeles Times building, in which 21 Times non-union employees were killed. The McNamara brothers were indicted, and Clarence Darrow was brought in to defend them. The case gripped the attention of the entire nation. Before the McNamara brothers could plead guilty, however, Darrow himself was charged by the Los Angeles district attorney with an attempt to bribe a juror. Darrow then hired Rogers as his chief counsel. When the case went to trial, however, Darrow frequently disagreed with his attorney over how the case should be tried. According to the account of Adela Rogers St. Johns, much of her father‚Äôs energy during the trial was given over to trying to persuade Darrow and his wife to accept his position on how to try the case. Rogers was successful in getting Darrow, the great champion of organized labor, to refrain from making an argument essentially condoning the dynamiting of the Times building and the killing of 21 people. Rogers and Darrow both made closing arguments. Rogers‚Äô short summary of the evidence was business-like and to the point, emphasizing his own theory of the case that Darrow was too smart to have been involved in a bribery scheme and that he would not in any event have knowingly run across the street at the scene of the bribery and thus drawn attention to his presence at the scene. Darrow was acquitted, but he was later indicted for allegedly attempting to bribe another juror in the McNamara case. Rogers began the second case as lead counsel but was soon forced to withdraw for health reasons. The second bribery trial ended in a hung jury, with several jurors holding out for a conviction. It was not until many months later that the second indictment was finally dismissed, based on Darrow‚Äôs agreement never to practice law in California again. The most difficult advocating that Earl Rogers faced in the Darrow case was to persuade Darrow not to continually hurt his own case with unappealing ‚Äì if not suicidal ‚Äì arguments.\\"Bradford, Glenn E., ‚ÄúWho's Running the Show?

It can be considered as a generalization of the well-known second-order M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory to multireference Complete Active Space cases. The theory is directly integrated into many quantum chemistry packages such as MOLCAS, Molpro, DALTON and ORCA. The research performed into the development of this theory led to various implementations. The theory here presented refers to the deployment for the Single-State NEVPT, where the perturbative correction is applied to a single electronic state. Research implementations has been also developed for Quasi-Degenerate cases, where a set of electronic states undergo the perturbative correction at the same time, allowing interaction among themselves. The theory development makes use of the quasi-degenerate formalism by Lindgren and the Hamiltonian multipartitioning technique from Zaitsevskii and Malrieu.  Theory  Let \\\\Psi_m^{(0)} be a zero-order CASCI wavefunction, defined as a linear combination of Slater determinants :\\\\Psi_m^{(0)} = \\\\sum_{I \\\\in {\\\\rm CAS}}C_{I,m} \\\\left|I\\\\right\\\\rangle obtained diagonalizing the true Hamiltonian \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}} inside the CASCI space :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{\\\\rm CAS}\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{\\\\rm CAS}\\\\left|\\\\Psi_m^{(0)}\\\\right\\\\rangle = E_m^{(0)} \\\\left|\\\\Psi_m^{(0)}\\\\right\\\\rangle where \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{\\\\rm CAS} is the projector inside the CASCI space. It is possible to define perturber wavefunctions in NEVPT as zero-order wavefunctions of the outer space (external to CAS) where k electrons are removed from the inactive part (core and virtual orbitals) and added to the valence part (active orbitals). At second order of perturbation -2 \\\\le k \\\\le 2. Decomposing the zero-order CASCI wavefunction as an antisymmetrized product of the inactive part \\\\Phi_c and a valence part \\\\Psi_m^v :\\\\left|\\\\Psi_m^{(0)}\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|\\\\Phi_c \\\\Psi_m^v\\\\right\\\\rangle then the perturber wavefunctions can be written as :\\\\left|\\\\Psi_{l,\\\\mu}^{k}\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|\\\\Phi_l^{-k} \\\\Psi_{\\\\mu}^{v+k}\\\\right\\\\rangle The pattern of inactive orbitals involved in the procedure can be grouped as a collective index l, so to represent the various perturber wavefunctions as \\\\Psi_{l,\\\\mu}^{k}, with \\\\mu an enumerator index for the different wavefunctions. The number of these functions is relative to the degree of contraction of the resulting perturbative space. Supposing indexes i and j referring to core orbitals, a and b referring to active orbitals and r and s referring to virtual orbitals, the possible excitation schemes are: # two electrons from core orbitals to virtual orbitals (the active space is not enriched nor depleted of electrons, therefore k=0) # one electron from a core orbital to a virtual orbital, and one electron from a core orbital to an active orbital (the active space is enriched with one electron, therefore k=+1) # one electron from a core orbital to a virtual orbital, and one electron from an active orbital to a virtual orbital (the active space is depleted with one electron, therefore k=-1) # two electrons from core orbitals to active orbitals (active space enriched with two electrons, k=+2) # two electrons from active orbitals to virtual orbitals (active space depleted with two electrons, k=-2) These cases always represent situations where interclass electronic excitations happen. Other three excitation schemes involve a single interclass excitation plus an intraclass excitation internal to the active space: # one electron from a core orbital to a virtual orbital, and an internal active-active excitation (k=0) # one electron from a core orbital to an active orbital, and an internal active-active excitation (k=+1) # one electron from an active orbital to a virtual orbital, and an internal active- active excitation (k=-1) = Totally Uncontracted Approach = A possible approach is to define the perturber wavefunctions into Hilbert spaces S_l^k defined by those determinants with given k and l labels. The determinants characterizing these spaces can be written as a partition comprising the same inactive (core + virtual) part \\\\Phi_l^{-k} and all possible valence (active) parts \\\\Psi_I^k :S_l^k \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ \\\\Phi_l^{-k} \\\\Psi_I^k \\\\\\\\} The full dimensionality of these spaces can be exploited to obtain the definition of the perturbers, by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian inside them :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{S_l^k}\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{S_l^k} \\\\left|\\\\Phi_l^{-k} \\\\Psi_{\\\\mu}^{v+k}\\\\right\\\\rangle = E_{l,\\\\mu} \\\\left|\\\\Phi_l^{-k} \\\\Psi_{\\\\mu}^{v+k}\\\\right\\\\rangle This procedure is impractical given its high computational cost: for each S_l^k space, a diagonalization of the true Hamiltonian must be performed. Computationally, is preferable to improve the theoretical development making use of the modified Dyall's Hamiltonian \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^D. This Hamiltonian behaves like the true Hamiltonian inside the CAS space, having the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the true Hamiltonian projected onto the CAS space. Also, given the decomposition for the wavefunction defined before, the action of the Dyall's Hamiltonian can be partitioned into :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^D \\\\left|\\\\Phi_l^{-k} \\\\Psi_{\\\\mu}^{v+k}\\\\right\\\\rangle = E_{l,\\\\mu}^{k} \\\\left|\\\\Phi_l^{-k} \\\\Psi_{\\\\mu}^{v+k}\\\\right\\\\rangle stripping out the constant contribution of the inactive part and leaving a subsystem to be solved for the valence part :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^D_v \\\\left|\\\\Psi_{\\\\mu}^{v+k}\\\\right\\\\rangle = E_{\\\\mu}^{k} \\\\left|\\\\Psi_{\\\\mu}^{v+k}\\\\right\\\\rangle The total energy E_{l,\\\\mu}^{k} is the sum of E_{\\\\mu}^{k} and the energies of the orbitals involved in the definition of the inactive part \\\\Phi_l^{-k}. This introduces the possibility to perform a single diagonalization of the valence Dyall's Hamiltonian on the CASCI zero- order wavefunction and evaluate the perturber energies using the property depicted above. = Strongly Contracted Approach = A different choice in the development of the NEVPT approach is to choose a single function for each space S_l^k, leading to the Strongly Contracted (SC) scheme. A set of perturbative operators are used to produce a single function for each space, defined as the projection inside each space \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{S_l^k} of the application of the Hamiltonian to the contracted zero order wavefunction. In other words, :\\\\Psi_l^k = \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{S_l^k} \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}} \\\\Psi_m^{(0)} where \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{S_l^k} is the projector onto the subspace. This can be equivalently written as the application of a specific part of the Hamiltonian to the zero-order wavefunction :\\\\Psi_l^k = V_l^k \\\\Psi_m^{(0)} For each space, appropriate operators can be devised. We will not present their definition, as it could result overkilling. Suffice to say that the resulting perturbers are not normalized, and their norm :N_l^k = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\Psi_l^k\\\\left.\\\\right\\\\Psi_l^k\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\Psi_m^{(0)}\\\\left\\\\left(V_l^k\\\\right)^+ V_l^k \\\\right\\\\Psi_m^{(0)} \\\\right\\\\rangle plays an important role in the Strongly Contracted development. To evaluate these norms, the spinless density matrix of rank not higher than three between the \\\\Psi_m^{(0)} functions are needed. An important property of the \\\\Psi_{l}^{k} is that any other function of the space S_l^k which is orthogonal to \\\\Psi_{l}^{k} do not interact with the zero-order wavefunction through the true Hamiltonian. It is possible to use the \\\\Psi_{l}^{k} functions as a basis set for the expansion of the first-order correction to the wavefunction, and also for the expression of the zero-order Hamiltonian by means of a spectral decomposition :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}_0 = \\\\sum_{lk} \\\\left\\\\Psi_{l}^{k}{}^\\\\prime \\\\right\\\\rangle E_{l}^{k} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{l}^{k}{}^\\\\prime \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\sum_{m} \\\\left\\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\right\\\\rangle E_{m}^{(0)} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\rightwhere \\\\left\\\\Psi_{l}^{k}{}^\\\\prime \\\\right\\\\rangle are the normalized \\\\left\\\\Psi_{l}^{k} \\\\right\\\\rangle. The expression for the first-order correction to the wavefunction is therefore :\\\\Psi_m^{(1)} = \\\\sum_{kl} \\\\left\\\\Psi_{l}^{k}{}^\\\\prime \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\frac{ \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{l}^{k}{}^\\\\prime \\\\left\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}} \\\\right\\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\right\\\\rangle} {E_m^{(0)} - E_{l}^{k}} = \\\\sum_{kl} \\\\left\\\\Psi_{l}^{k}{}^\\\\prime \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{N_l^k}}{E_{m}^{(0)} - E_{l}^{k}} and for the energy is :E_{m}^{(2)} = \\\\sum_{kl} \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{l}^{k}{}^\\\\prime \\\\left\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}} \\\\right\\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right|^2} {E_m^{(0)} - E_{l}^{k}} = \\\\sum_{kl} \\\\frac{N_l^k}{E_m^{(0)} - E_{l}^{k}} This result still misses a definition of the perturber energies E_l^k, which can be defined in a computationally advantageous approach by means of the Dyall's Hamiltonian : E_{l}^{k} = \\\\frac{1}{N_l^k} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{l}^{k} \\\\left\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^D \\\\right\\\\Psi_{l}^{k} \\\\right\\\\rangle leading to :N_{l}^{k} E_{l}^{k} = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\left\\\\left( V_{l}^{k}\\\\right)^{+} \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^D V_{l}^{k} \\\\right\\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\left\\\\left(V_{l}^{k} \\\\right)^{+} V_{l}^{k} \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^D \\\\right\\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\left\\\\left( V_{l}^{k}\\\\right)^{+} \\\\left[ \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^D , V_{l}^{k} \\\\right] \\\\right\\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\right\\\\rangle Developing the first term and extracting the inactive part of the Dyall's Hamiltonian it can be obtained :E_{l}^{k} = E_m^{(0)} + \\\\Delta \\\\epsilon_l + \\\\frac{1}{N_l^k} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\left\\\\left(V_{l}^{k}\\\\right)^{+} \\\\left[\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}_v , V_{l}^{k} \\\\right] \\\\right\\\\Psi_{m}^{(0)} \\\\right\\\\rangle with \\\\Delta \\\\epsilon_l equal to the sum of the orbital energies of the newly occupied virtual orbitals minus the orbital energies of the unoccupied core orbitals. The term that still needs to be evaluated is the bracket involving the commutator. This can be obtained developing each V operator and substituting. To obtain the final result it is necessary to evaluate Koopmans matrices and density matrices involving only active indexes. An interesting case is represented by the contribution for the V_{ijrs}^{(0)} case, which is trivial and can be demonstrated identical to the M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset second-order contribution :E_m^{(2)}\\\\left( S_{rsij}^{0} \\\\right) = - \\\\frac{N_{rsij}^{0}}{\\\\epsilon_r +\\\\epsilon_s - \\\\epsilon_i - \\\\epsilon_{j}} NEVPT2 can therefore be seen as a generalized form of MP2 to multireference wavefunctions. = Partially Contracted Approach = An alternative approach, named Partially Contracted (PC) is to define the perturber wavefunctions in a subspace \\\\overline{S}_l^k of S_l^k with dimensionality higher than one (like in case of the Strongly Contracted approach). To define this subspace, a set of functions \\\\Phi is generated by means of the V_l^k operators, after decontraction of their formulation. For example, in the case of the V_{rsi}^{-1} operator :V_{rsi}^{-1} = \\\\gamma_{rs} \\\\sum_a \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\langle rs\\\\left.\\\\rightia \\\\right\\\\rangle E_{ri} E_{sa} + \\\\left\\\\langle sr \\\\left.\\\\rightia \\\\right\\\\rangle E_{si} E_{ra} \\\\right) \\\\quad r \\\\le s The Partially Contracted approach makes use of functions \\\\Phi_{risa} = E_{ri} E_{sa} \\\\Psi_m^{(0)} and \\\\Phi_{risa} = E_{si} E_{ra} \\\\Psi_m^{(0)}. These functions must be orthonormalized and purged of linear dependencies which may arise. The resulting set spans the \\\\overline{S}_{rsi}^{-1} space. Once all the \\\\overline{S}_l^k spaces have been defined, we can obtain as usual a set of perturbers from the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (true or Dyall) inside this space :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{\\\\overline{S}_l^k}\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_{\\\\overline{S}_l^k} \\\\left\\\\Psi_{l\\\\mu}^{k} \\\\right\\\\rangle = E_{l,\\\\mu}^{k} \\\\left\\\\Psi_{l\\\\mu}^{k} \\\\right\\\\rangle As usual, the evaluation of the Partially Contracted perturbative correction by means of the Dyall Hamiltonian involves simply manageable entities for nowadays computers. Although the Strongly Contracted approach makes use of a perturbative space with very low flexibility, in general it provides values in very good agreement with those obtained by the more decontracted space defined for the Partially Contracted approach. This can be probably explained by the fact that the Strongly Contracted perturbers are a good average of the totally decontracted perturbative space. The Partially Contracted evaluation has a very little overhead in computational cost with respect to the Strongly Contracted one, therefore they are normally evaluated together.  Properties  NEVPT is blessed with many important properties, making the approach very solid and reliable. These properties arise both from the theoretical approach used and on the Dyall's Hamiltonian particular structure: *Size consistency: NEVPT is size consistent (strict separable). Briefly, if A and B are two non-interacting systems, the energy of the supersystem A-B is equal to the sum of the energy of A plus the energy of B taken by themselves (E(A-B) = E(A) + E(B)). This property is of particular importance to obtain correctly behaving dissociation curves. * Absence of intruder states: in perturbation theory, divergencies can occur if the energy of some perturber happens to be nearly equal to the energy of the zero-order wavefunction. This situation, which is due to the presence of an energy difference at the denominator, can be avoided if the energies associated to the perturbers are guaranteed to be never nearly equal to the zero-order energy. NEVPT satisfies this requirement. * Invariance under active orbital rotation: The NEVPT results are stable if an intraclass active-active orbital mixing occurs. This arises both from the structure of the Dyall Hamiltonian and the properties of a CASSCF wavefunction. This property has been also extended to the intraclass core-core and virtual-virtual mixing, thanks to the Non Canonical NEVPT approach, allowing to apply a NEVPT evaluation without performing an orbital canonization (which is required, as we saw previously) * Spin purity is guaranteed: The resulting wave functions are guaranteed to be spin pure, due to the spin-free formalism. * Efficiency: although not a formal theoretical property, computational efficiency is highly important for the evaluation on medium-size molecular systems. The current limit of the NEVPT application is largely dependent on the feasibility of the previous CASSCF evaluation, which scales factorially with respect to the active space size. The NEVPT implementation using the Dyall's Hamiltonian involves the evaluation of Koopmans' matrices and density matrices up to the four-particle density matrix spanning only active orbitals. This is particularly convenient, given the small size of currently used active spaces. * Partitioning into additive classes: The perturbative correction to the energy is additive on eight different contributions. Although the evaluation of each contribution has a different computational cost, this fact can be used to improve performance, by parallelizing each contribution to a different processor.

Background Kindersley was born in Wanstead, Essex. His father was an Old Etonian from a wealthy family who had been a Captain in the Indian Army, but had fallen on hard times since resigning his commission and becoming a chemist. Kindersley was educated at Repton School, but was forced to leave in 1887 when his father could no longer afford the fees. Banking career He then became a clerk in several London firms before joining the London Stock Exchange in 1901, becoming a partner in David A. Bevan & Co in 1902 and the merchant bank Lazard Brothers & Co in 1905, a firm with which he was connected for the rest of his life and of which he became chairman in 1919. Public service From 1915 to 1925, Kindersley was Governor (Company Chairman) of the Hudson's Bay Company, North America's oldest company (established by English royal charter in 1670). He served as a director of the Bank of England from 1914 to 1946. In 1924 he was the senior British representative on the Dawes Committee. Kindersley is chiefly recognised for his work as chairman of the National Savings Committee from 1916 to 1920; he was then its president until 1946. He was also a major shareholder in the Canadian Northern Railway, later amalgamated into Canadian National Railways, and the town of Kindersley, Saskatchewan, was named after him. Personal life He married Gladys Margaret Beadle, daughter of Maj-Gen James Prinsep Beadle, of Worton Grange, co. Wiltshire, on 3 November 1896 and had six children, Lionel, Hugh, Margaret, Richard, Philip (who married Oonagh Guinness and Valerie Violet French) and Elizabeth. Lord Kindersley was succeeded in the Barony by his second son Hugh, his eldest son Lionel having been killed in action in the First World War. Honours and arms Kindersley was knighted as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1917 and raised to Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours for his chairmanship of the National Savings Committee. He served as High Sheriff of Sussex for 1928 and in 1941 was raised to the peerage as Baron Kindersley, of West Hoathly in the County of West Sussex.

Initially believed to be a royal tomb, it is now believed to have been a storage chamber for the mummification process.\\"Pharaonic find was mummification room, not tomb\\", Discovery Channel. Retrieved 29 May 2006. It was found in 2005 by a team of archaeologists led by Dr. Otto Schaden. The chamber contained seven wooden coffins and many large storage jars. All coffins have now been opened, and were found to contain only mummification materials, with the jars also containing mummification supplies including salts, linens, and deliberately broken pottery. Some clay seal impressions contain text, such as the partial word 'pa-aten,'\\"Egypt's New Tomb Revealed,\\" Discovery Channel (broadcast: June 4, 2006) part of the name used by Tutankhamun's wife, Ankhesenamun. This inscription, the architectural style of the chamber, and the form of the coffins and jars all point to an Eighteenth Dynasty date, roughly contemporary with Tutankhamun, whose tomb is nearby. KV63 was revisited by Schaden's team again in 2010, along with a TV team. Another 16 storage jars were explored, and a wooden bed with lions' heads, along with pieces of wine jars, were discovered. The team arrived at the theory that the chamber was probably used by Tutankhamun's family embalmers, some time about 1337‚Äì1334 BC. Discovery The vertical shaft of KV63 was re- discovered on 10 March 2005. The discovery that the shaft led to a chamber was announced on 8 February 2006, by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, which credited the find to a team of U.S. archaeologists from the University of Memphis, under the leadership of Dr. Otto Schaden. The chamber ‚Äî given the name \\"KV63\\" in accordance with the sequential numbering convention used in the Valley ‚Äî was initially thought to be a tomb, the first new one to be revealed there since the discovery of KV62, the tomb of Tutankhamun, by Howard Carter in 1922. KV63 is located in the area between KV10 (Amenmesse) and KV62 (Tutankhamun),\\"KV63 Some more photos\\" . Retrieved June 2, 2006 in the very centre of the Valley's eastern branch and near the main crossroads of the network of paths traversed by thousands of tourists every day. The discovery was made as the archaeological team was excavating the remains of 19th dynasty workmen's huts at the entrance to KV10, looking for evidence to clarify the succession of Amenmesse. The area around the huts had accumulated rubble from the occasional flooding. Both Theodore M. Davis and Howard Carter had dug in the area in the early twentieth century, but had not removed these particular huts. While exploring a layer of dark rock, the dig suddenly came across chips of white stone (these being the last level excavated by Carter). Further exploration revealed a straight edge of cut stone, which turned out to be on the upper lip of a vertical shaft. At that point the team knew they had discovered something much more elaborate and significant than the remains of the tomb-diggers' resthouses. Unfortunately, the discovery came at the very end of the 2004‚Äì05 digging season, and further excavations had to be postponed until the team recommenced its work the following autumn. Description of chamber The overhang on the shaft of KV63 has been compared with and found to be similar to other Eighteenth Dynasty tombs (that of Yuya and Tjuyu), thereby dating the construction to the latter portion of the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca. 14th century BC) of the New Kingdom (16th century to 11th century BC).Rose, Mark. \\"KV 63: A Look at the New Tomb\\", Archaeology (May 1, 2006) Retrieved July 6, 2006 It is also broadly speculated that all three tombs are the work of the same architect, or at least the same school of architects. The newly revealed shaft descends some five metres. At the bottom of this pit stands a 1.5 metre tall door made of stone blocks. Behind this door, in which the team originally opened up a small window for the 10 February 2006 event, stands the single chamber. No seals were found on the door, and it was initially believed that KV63 was a reburial and had experienced some intrusion in antiquity. The blocking stones in the doorway were not original, suggesting that the doorway had been opened and closed a few times. The original blocking stones were found inside the tomb, giving evidence that someone had re-entered and sealed the tomb in antiquity. The chamber measures some four metres by five and has plain white walls. It contained seven wooden coffins, including one scaled for a child and one for a small infant. Two of the adult coffins and the child's coffin feature yellow funerary masks; the others have black funerary masks. It has been suggested that those with yellow faces may have been designed for female occupants. There is extensive termite damage on some coffins and the result was likened by the excavating team to \\"black paste\\"; however, at least two coffins were virtually untouched by termites. These termites seem to have come from the workers' huts above the shaft, and therefore probably date from the pharaonic era. There was no evidence of water damage. However, now that the chamber has been opened, the site is at risk of damage from flash floods. The identity of the owners of the coffins is unknown; in any case none contained human remains, all having been used to hold material relating to the embalming process. There is no evidence for the chamber having been sealed more than once and it thus seems that the deposit represents embalming debris from one particular person's mummification. The chamber also held 28 large storage jars, approximately 75 cm tall, made from both pottery and alabaster. The jars weighed in at around 40 or 43 kg (90‚Äì95 pounds), varying slightly in size and weight. Three of them appear to have been broken in antiquity at the rim or lower neck. Most of the jars were discovered with intact lids, but did not bear pharaonic seal impressions. Shortly after their manufacture, the jars were whitewashed while standing in sand, and the bottoms show the original clay. A large ostracon, not identified to have come from one of the storage jars at this time, was discovered and broken during the modern opening of the tomb. According to Dr. Schaden, the method of sealing the storage jars had been very deliberate. A mud plug was first inserted, then a seal, and then a large plaster seal. Apparently, the people doing it had thought it of prime importance that it should be done in this very precise manner. This supports the idea that there was a solid reason behind the placing of the artifacts and that the chamber was not merely a dumping ground. There was over 175 kg of natron in the chamber, some inside the coffins and some inside little sacks. The jars and contents are similar to those from KV54, the Tutankhamun embalming cache. Work has been going on to carefully remove the coffins and the storage jars to KV10, which has adequate space for a conservation team to conduct a thorough examination and analysis of the coffins and jars in a proper, scientific manner. A pulley system was devised to facilitate the safe removal of the coffins and jars from the shaft. Grass buckets and bubblewrap were used to lift the jars out from the place where they were packed away for 3000 years. The removal of jars began on 2 March 2006 and most jars have been relocated safely along with one large sealed alabaster jar, which contained small pots packed in mud. Twelve of the storage jars have thus far been examined. Contents include natron, wood, seeds, shells, carbon, assorted pottery, small animal bones, papyrus fragments, mud trays, mud seals, and pieces of twine or rope.\\"KV63 expedition Web site\\". Retrieved June 2, 2006 Egyptologist Salima Ikram is supervising the removal and examination of the contents.

Discovery Channel News online. Retrieved June 10, 2006 the materials used for these will be of great interest. On May 26, 2006, a 42 cm. pink gold leaf anthropoid coffinette was discovered inside the youth coffin, under the pillows. The last and only completely sealed coffin was opened on June 28, 2006. As cameras were rolling, it was revealed that the coffin contained no mummy, only artifacts used for mummification or to decorate a body. It looked like it had once been used, as there was an impression of a human body in the bottom of the coffin. It is theorized that this body was moved or destroyed in antiquity. Due to its proximity to the tomb of Tutankhamun and the resemblances between the portraits in the sarcophagi, as well as the style contemporary to the latter part of the 18th Dynasty, there was groundless speculation at the time of the first discovery that the coffins were once used for the bodies of Kiya and/or even Ankhesenamen. However, there is no reason to believe that the coffins were other than that of basic types used for private persons, probably derived from undertakers' stock for use to contain embalming debris. Given the location of the tomb, and the fact that its entrance was sealed by the same flood layer that sealed that of Tutankhamun, it seems most likely that KV63 was the main embalmers' cache for Tutankhamun's burial. In this case, the long-known group of material deriving from his funeral found in KV54 probably represents an 'overflow' of material requiring disposal after KV63 had been sealed.

From 1535 to 1545 he was Recorder of London and served in the House of Commons. He is possibly best remembered for his endowment to found a free grammar school, Highgate School, at London. Background and early life Cholmeley (sometimes spelled \\"Cholmley\\" or \\"Cholmondeley; all pronounced \\"Ààt É åmli\\", \\"CHUM-lee\\") was the illegitimate son of Sir Richard Cholmeley of Yorkshire (c. 1460 - 1521), who served as Lieutenant of the Tower of London from 1513 to 1520. Cholmeley's family can be traced back to the 12th-century Robert de Chelmundelegh, second son of William le Belward, who inherited parts of the Barony of Malpas (for which Malpas, Cheshire, is named), including Cholmondeley, Cheshire, previously held by Robert Fitzhugh. Over the centuries, the family name was spelt in many variants as Middle English developed away from French influences.

In 1520 he was called as a bencher of Lincoln's Inn, in 1531 became a serjeant-at-law, and in November 1534 was knighted. From 1535-45 he was Recorder of London, during which time he was one of the city's Members of Parliament in four Parliaments. In November 1545 Cholmeley became Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and in May 1552 was appointed Chief Justice of the King's Bench. He was Lord Chief Justice for only a year as Queen Mary I would not reappoint him. The same year, he was imprisoned for a month and fined for signing Lady Jane Grey's instrument of succession as Queen. He returned to work as a barrister and was a Member of Parliament for Middlesex from 1554 to 1559. Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth I stayed the night of 15 Feb 1555 with Cholmeleys in Highgate. Highgate School Cholmeley founded Highgate School, which was established by Royal Charter in 1565. Former pupils of the school are known as Old Cholmeleians in his memory. The school has gone on to become a leading independent school (sometimes referred to as a public school). Old Cholmeleians include John Venn, the creator of Venn diagrams, poets Gerard Manley Hopkins and John Betjeman, and musicians John Tavener and John Rutter.

Though the Croix-de-Feu had adopted as its slogan \\"Social d'abord\\" (\\"Social First\\") as a counter to the \\"Politique d'abord\\" (\\"Politics First\\") of Action Fran√ßaise, it espoused the political goals elaborated by La Rocque in his tract Service Public ‚Äî including social- Catholic corporatism, the institution of a minimum wage and paid vacations (cong√©s pay√©s), women's suffrage, and the reform of parliamentary procedure.Fran√ßois de La Rocque. Service public (1934). The programme of the Social Party would further develop these same themes, advocating \\"the association of capital and labour\\", a traditional platitude of French conservatism, and the reform of France's political institutions along presidential lines, in order to bolster the stability and authority of the state.La Rocque (1934). Though the Croix-de-Feu participated in the demonstrations of 6 February 1934, La Rocque forbade its members from involving themselves in the subsequent riot, demonstrating a respect for republican legality that the PSF would also uphold as one of its essential political principles. Thus La Rocque, who had previously maintained a certain mystique with regard to his attitude towards the Republic, explicitly rallied to it, denouncing, in a speech on 23 May 1936, totalitarianism (both Nazi and Soviet) along with racism (with regard to which he explicitly rejected antisemitism) and class struggle, as the principal obstacles to \\"national reconciliation\\".Fran√ßois de La Rocque. \\"Bulletin d'information du PSF du 8 juillet 1938, discours au Congr√©s PSF de Marseille, le 8 juin 1937\\", Bulletin des Amis de La Rocque, ‚Ññ 60 (1998). Nevertheless, critics of the left and centre denounced the Croix-de-Feu, together with the other leagues, as fascist organizations. A desire to defend the republic was not their sole motivation: politicians of the centre-right and left alike opposed La Rocque due to the perceived threat of his success in mobilizing a mass base within their traditional, and particularly working-class, constituencies.William D. Irvine. French Conservatism in Crisis (Louisiana State University Press, 1979), p. 93. Due to the disruptive nature of the leagues' activities, the Laval government outlawed paramilitary groups on 6 December 1935, and although this decision was succeeded by the law of 10 January 1936 regulating militias and combat organizations, the law was only partially implemented: of all the leagues, only Action Fran√ßaise was dissolved, and the Croix-de-Feu was allowed to continue its activities essentially unimpeded. Following the victory of the Popular Front, which had included in its electoral programme a promise to dissolve the right-wing leagues, in the parliamentary elections of May 1936, the government issued a decree banning the Croix-de-Feu, along with the Mouvement social fran√ßais, on 18 June. Within weeks, on 7 July, La Rocque founded the French Social Party to succeed the defunct league. Political success and cooperation (1936‚Äì40) =Organization and mass mobilization= The PSF inherited the large popular base of the Croix-de-Feu (450,000 members in June 1936, most of them having joined since 1934)Julian Jackson. The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934-38 (Cambridge, 1988), p. 252. and, mirroring the contemporary Popular Front, achieved considerable success in mobilizing it through a variety of associated organizations: sporting societies, labour organizations, and leisure and vacation camps. PSF members also orchestrated the development of \\"professional unions\\" (), envisioned as a means of organizing management against labour militancy, which espoused class collaboration and claimed 1,000,000 members by 1938.P. Machefer. \\"Les Syndicats professionels fran√ßais (1936-39)\\", MS (1982), p. 90-112. Unlike established right-wing parties such as the Republican Federation and Democratic Alliance, which had traditionally lacked a formal membership structure and relied instead on the support of notables, the PSF aggressively courted an extensive membership among the middle and lower classes. By 1940, the PSF had become not only France's first right-wing mass party but also the nation's largest party in terms of membership: over 700,000 members (and more than a million according to some historians Jackson (1988), p. 254.), it eclipsed even the traditionally mass-based Socialist (SFIO) and Communist Parties (202,000 and 288,000 members, respectively, in December 1936 Jackson (1988), p. 219-20.). The party's central committee included its president, La Rocque, vice-presidents Jean Mermoz and No√´l Ottavi, Edmond Barrachin, Charles Vallin, Jean Ybarnegaray, Jean Borotra, and Georges Rich√©. The party had two newspapers: Le Flambeau and Le Petit Journal. The Popular Front Chamber of Deputies (1936‚Äì40). PSF deputies sat originally with the Independent Republicans group (included on this diagram as part of the right), leaving it to compose their own group in 1938. =Electoral success= Six members of the nascent PSF were elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1936, and three more were elected in by-elections between 1936 and 1939. Two deputies of other right-wing parliamentary groups defected to the party. The true measure of the party's electoral potential, however, came with the municipal elections of 1938‚Äì39, in which it won 15% of votes nationally.Jacques Nob√©court, La Rocque (Fayard, 1996), p. 646. As a result of the proportional representation law passed by the Chamber in June 1939, this promised to translate into approximately one hundred deputies in the legislative elections planned for 1940. By 1939, the party's elected officials, its eleven deputies aside, included nearly three thousand mayors, 541 general councilors and thousands of municipal councilors.Nob√©court (1996), p. 647. =Competition with established right-wing parties= Of all the PSF's successes, it was the party's popularity among the classes moyennes, the peasants, shopkeepers, and clerical workers, who had been hardest hit by the Great Depression. They generated the most fear from the left. This demographic was historically one of the primary bastions of the Radical-Socialist Party, and its falling under the influence of the \\"fascist\\" right was viewed by Popular Front leaders as a serious threat to the stability of the republic. The PSF, for its part, actively courted the classes moyennes and argued that their traditional Radical defenders had abandoned them by supporting the Popular Front. Despite this demographic threat, however, the PSF generated the most fervent hostility within the parties of the established parliamentary right, most notably the conservative Republican Federation. The tensions between the Federation and the PSF were demonstrated as early as 1937, by a Normandy by-election in which the Federation candidate, after being behind the PSF candidate in the first round, initially refused to stand down and support the latter in the runoff round. The rancor of the feuding parties, despite the Federation candidate's eventual endorsement of the PSF, resulted in the seat falling to the centre, demonstrating to Federation and PSF leaders alike the undesirability of co-existence. Thus, although the two parties were in fact in agreement on many questions of ideology, notably their defense of the far- right leagues, the PSF was viewed by the long-established Federation as a rival \\"to its own electoral fortunes\\".Irvine (1979), p. 157. A second victim of the PSF's popularity was Jacques Doriot's far-right Parti Populaire Fran√ßais (PPF), which incorporated nationalist as well as virulently anticommunist and openly fascist tendencies. Founded, like the PSF, in June 1936, the PPF enjoyed initial success, attracting a membership of 295,000, according to the party's own statistics, by the beginning of 1938.Jackson (1988), p. 255. With the continued growth of the PSF, however, the PPF fell into decline, parallelling the demise of the Popular Front to which it had largely been a reaction. In March 1937, Doriot proposed the formation of a Front de la Libert√© (\\"Front of Liberty\\") with the objective of unifying the right in opposition to the Popular Front. Although the Republican Federation, followed by several small right-wing parties that stood to lose little from allying themselves to the more extremist PPF, quickly accepted Doriot's proposal, it was rejected both by the moderate Democratic Alliance and by La Rocque, who identified the Front as an attempt to \\"annex\\" the popularity of his party.P. Machefer. \\"L'Union des droites, le PSF et le Front de la Libert√©, 1936-37\\", Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine, Vol. 17 (1970), p. 112-26. His insistence on the PSF's independence got La Rocque attacked violently by other figures on the right, including former Croix-de-Feu members who had abandoned the more moderate Social Party.Machefer (1970). =Rapprochement with the Radical Party= The major parties of the right fell in disarray after their electoral defeat and the strike movement of June 1936: although the Republican Federation, at least, was consistent in its opposition to Popular Front policies, the Democratic Alliance and the small, Christian democratic Popular Democratic Party (PDP) were reluctant to criticize the government lest this sabotage their efforts to lure the Radical Party into a center-right coalition.Jackson (1988), p. 257. Thus the Independent Radicals, gathering right-wing Radical parliamentarians, constituted the most effective opposition to the Popular Front, particularly in the Senate. With the prospect of a PSF breakthrough in the 1940 elections in mind, the Independent Radicals sought to cooperate with this new force; for their part, the PSF deputies voted confidence in √âdouard Daladier's Radical government in April 1938. With the collapse of the Popular Front the PSF-Radical alliance seemed inevitable to many on the left, with the Socialist newspaper Le Populaire writing, in 1938, that \\"the PSF-Radical bloc has become a reality of political life\\", although this observation appeared premature to most contemporary observers.Cited in Nob√©court (1996), p. 1063, note 58. In the original French: \\"le bloc PSF-Radicaux devient une r√©alit√© courante de la vie politique\\". Wartime activities (1940‚Äì45) The Danzig crisis of 1939 deprived the PSF of the chance to make serious inroads in parliament: on 30 July, Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier, fearing that the imminent electoral campaign would distract the Chamber of Deputies from the business of national defense, used the decree powers granted him by the Chamber to extend its term until May 1942.William Shirer. The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry Into the Fall of France in 1940 (New York, 1969), p. 434. Following the fall of France and the establishment of the Vichy regime, which La Rocque denounced as defeatist and anti-Semitic, but he still proclaimed his personal loyalty to Marshal Philippe P√©tain,Jean Lacouture. Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran√ßais (Le Seuil, 1998), p. 55. and the PSF was renamed Progr√®s Social Fran√ßais (French Social Progress) and took on the form of a social aid organization because of the occupation authorities' prohibition of organized political activities. La Rocque's attitude towards the Vichy government was initially ambiguous. As stated, he continued to affirm his loyalty to P√©tain and was amenable to certain of the more moderate aspects of Vichy's reactionary program, the R√©volution Nationale, notably its corporatism and social policies. The PSF further refused to recognize General Charles de Gaulle's Free French, along with the National Council of the Resistance, as the legitimate French authorities in opposition to Vichy, which also claimed constitutional legitimacy (despite some members of the PSF, such as Charles Vallin, joining the Free French). However, La Rocque was hostile to Vichy's enthusiastic collaboration with the Nazi occupiers and forbade PSF members from participating in Vichy-sponsored organizations such as the Service d'Ordre L√©gionnaire, the Milice, and the Legion of French Volunteers. In August 1940, La Rocque began actively to participate in the French Resistance by transmitting information to the British Secret Intelligence Service via Georges Charaudeau's R√©seau Alibi (\\"Alibi Network\\") and forming the R√©seau Klan (\\"Klan Network\\") in 1942 as a means of coordinating intelligence- gathering activities among PSF members. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that he could convince P√©tain to abandon his collaborationist line and so he requested and was granted, three meetings with the Marshal in early 1943. Two days after their last meeting, on 9 March, La Rocque was arrested by the Gestapo during a nationwide roundup of over 100 PSF leaders.Nob√©court (1998). Deported first to Czechoslovakia and later to Austria, he returned to France only in May 1945. As with nearly all other political parties that had existed under the Third Republic, the PSF produced both collaborators with and resisters of the Vichy regime. In most cases, individual circumstances dictated more ambiguous loyalties and actions. Although former PSF deputy Jean Ybarnegaray, for instance, served in the first Vichy government under P√©tain as Minister for Veterans and the Family, he resigned his post in 1940 and was in 1943 arrested and deported because of his efforts in helping Resistance members to cross the Pyrenees into Spain.Robert O. Paxton. Vichy France (Columbia, 2001), note p. 212. Postwar legacy (1945‚Äì58) =Official continuation= In August 1945, following the liberation of France, La Rocque and his remaining followers, principally Pierre de L√©otard, Andr√© Portier, and Jean de Mierry, established the Parti R√©publicain Social de la R√©conciliation Fran√ßaise (Social Republican Party of French Reconciliation), known generally as R√©conciliation Fran√ßaise and intended as the official successor of the PSF.√âric Duhamel. \\"Mat√©riaux pour l'histoire du Rassemblement des Gauches R√©publicaines (RGR)\\", Recherches contemporaines, ‚Ññ 5 (1998-99), p. 178. The article is available for download here (1) . On the initiative of L√©otard the PRSRF participated in the right-wing Rally of the Republican Lefts (RGR, see sinistrisme) coalition in the elections of June 1946, November 1946, 1951, and 1956. The death of La Rocque in 1946 deprived the party of unifying leadership, however, and the pre-war popularity it had hoped to exploit never materialized. Though the PRSRF had effectively disappeared by 1956, with the schism that year of the RGR into center-left and center-right groups, some of its members would later continue their political careers within the conservative National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) party. =Ideological successors= Despite the postwar insignificance of the party itself, elements of the PSF's and La Rocque's ideology strongly influenced the political formations of right and centre during the Fourth Republic. La Rocque had advised his followers to create \\"a third party, sincerely republican and very bold from a social perspective\\" Nob√©court (1998). In the original French: \\"[...] Un tiers parti, franchement r√©publicain, tr√®s hardi d'un point de vue social\\". ‚Äî by which he meant R√©conciliation Fran√ßaise within the Rally of the Republican Lefts: but for some former PSF loyalists and sympathizers the statement applied more accurately to the newly formed, Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (Mouvement R√©publicain Populaire, MRP); and, for others (notably Fran√ßois Mitterrand √âric Duhamel. L'UDSR ou la gen√®se de Fran√ßois Mitterrand (Paris, 2007).), the left-liberal Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR). PSF ideology, particularly its corporatist emphasis on the association of capital and labour, and its advocacy of a strong, stable presidential regime to replace the parliamentary republic, would also contribute to the development of Gaullism, culminating in the establishment of the presidential Fifth Republic in 1958. The postwar Gaullist party, the Rally of the French People (RPF), like the MRP, enthusiastically adopted the mass-based model of organization and mobilization that had been pioneered by the PSF ‚Äî a sharp and permanent break from the cadre-based parties of the prewar classical right. Historiography Historical debate over the PSF, like its predecessor, the Croix-de-Feu, has been driven by the question of whether they can be considered, in at least some respects, the manifestations of a \\"French fascism\\". Most contemporary French historians, notably Ren√© R√©mond, Michel Winock, Jean Lacouture, and Pierre Milza, have rejected this assertion. R√©mond, in his La Droite en France, identifies the PSF instead as an offshoot of the Bonapartist tradition in French right-wing politics ‚Äî populist and anti-parliamentarian, but hardly fascist;Ren√© R√©mond. La Droite en France (Aubier-Montaigne, 1968). Milza, in La France des ann√©es 30, writes that, \\"the PSF was more anti-parliamentarian than anti- republican\\".Pierre Milza. La France des ann√©es 30 (Armand Colin, 1988), p. 132. More recently, Lacouture has written that \\"La Rocque's movement was neither fascist nor extremist\\".Lacouture (1998), p. 29. Furthermore, R√©mond has identified the PSF, at least in part, as a populist and social-Catholic \\"antidote\\" to French fascism; thus: \\"Far from representing a French form of fascism in the face of the Popular Front, La Rocque helped to safeguard France from fascism\\", by diverting the support of the middle classes away from more extremist alternatives.R√©mond (1968). In the original French of the 1952 edition: \\"Loin d'avoir repr√©sent√© une forme fran√ßaise du fascisme devant le Front populaire, La Rocque contribua √† pr√©server la France du fascisme\\". Jacques Nob√©court has made similar assertions: \\"La Rocque spared France from a pre-war experiment with totalitarianism\\".Nob√©court (1998). In the original French: \\"La Rocque √©vita √† la France l'aventure du totalitarisme avant guerre\\". The lasting confusion over the \\"fascist\\" tendencies of the PSF can be ascribed, in part, to two factors. Firstly, the PSF's predecessor, the Croix- de-Feu, had aspired to a paramilitary aesthetic (described by Julian Jackson as a \\"fascist frisson\\" and dismissed by R√©mond as \\"political boy scouting for adults\\") outwardly similar to that employed by the more overtly fascist of the right-wing leagues; furthermore, La Rocque continued to defend the leagues' activities even in the face of their condemnation by the parties of the established moderate right (though not the Republican Federation).Jackson (1988), p. 253. Secondly, the PSF's condemnation of parliamentarism, which was considered synonymous with French republicanism by most leftist and centrist politicians of the left and centre, marked it as inherently anti-republican and thus \\"fascist\\" in the period's political discourse in their opinions. A number of foreign historians, however, have questioned these defenses of La Rocque and the PSF. Zeev Sternhell, criticizing R√©mond's classification of the PSF as Bonapartist in Neither Right Nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France, associates the party and its leader with a \\"revolutionary right\\" tradition that owes its political heritage to Boulangism and the revolutionary syndicalism of Georges Sorel.Zeev Sternhell. Neither Right Nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France (University of California Press, 1995). This minority view is partially shared by Robert Soucy,Robert Soucy. Fascismes fran√ßais? : 1933-39 (Autrement, 2004). William D. Irvine, and Michel Dobry,Michel Dobry. Le Mythe de l'allergie fran√ßaise au fascisme (Albin Michel, 2003). who argue that the Croix-de-Feu and the PSF were partially-realized manifestations of a distinctively-French fascism, their political potential, though not their tactics of organization and mobilization, which was destroyed by the German invasion and thus permanently discredited. Sternhell, pointing to the democratic path to power followed by the Nazi Party, has also made the argument that La Rocque's apparent respect for republican legality is not enough to disqualify his movement as fascist.

It is also known as sample rate, i.e. the number of data samples captured per second, each sample normally occurring at the clock edge. The terms are neutral with respect to the method of physically accomplishing each such data-transfer operation; nevertheless, they are most commonly used in the context of transmission of digital data. 1 MT/s is 106 or one million transfers per second; similarly, 1 GT/s means 109, or equivalently in the US/short scale, one billion transfers per second. The choice of the symbol T for transfer conflicts with the International System of Units, in which T stands for the tesla unit of magnetic flux density (so \\"Megatesla per second\\" would be a reasonable unit to describe the rate of a rapidly changing magnetic field, such as in a pulsed field magnet or kicker magnet - although the equivalent units of \\"tesla per microsecond\\" (T/Œºs) would reflect typical engineering values better). These terms alone do not specify the bit rate at which binary data is being transferred, because they do not specify the number of bits transferred in each transfer operation (known as the channel width or word length). In order to calculate the data transmission rate, one must multiply the transfer rate by the information channel width. For example, a data bus eight-bytes wide (64 bits) by definition transfers eight bytes in each transfer operation; at a transfer rate of 1 GT/s, the data rate would be 8 √ó 109 B/s, i.e. 8 GB/s, or approximately 7.45 GiB/s. The bit rate for this example is 64 Gbit/s (8 √ó 8 √ó 109 bit/s). The formula for a data transfer rate is: Channel width (bits/transfer) √ó transfers/second = bits/second. Expanding the width of a channel, for example that between a CPU and a northbridge, increases data throughput without requiring an increase in the channel's operating frequency (measured in transfers per second). This is analogous to increasing throughput by increasing bandwidth but leaving latency unchanged. The units usually refer to the \\"effective\\" number of transfers, or transfers perceived from \\"outside\\" of a system or component, as opposed to the internal speed or rate of the clock of the system. One example is a computer bus running at double data rate where data is transferred on both the rising and falling edge of the clock signal. If its internal clock runs at 100 MHz, then the effective rate is 200 MT/s, because there are 100 million rising edges per second and 100 million falling edges per second of a clock signal running at 100 MHz. SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) falls in the megatransfer range of data transfer rate, while newer bus architectures like the front side bus, Quick Path Interconnect, PCI Express and HyperTransport operate at the rate of a few GT/s.

Borski was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and he graduated from the University of Baltimore in 1971. He was a member of the Pennsylvania state house of representatives from 1977 to 1982. In 1982, he took on GOP Representative Charles F. Dougherty in the 3rd Congressional District, which had been renumbered from the 4th after the 1980 Census. 1982 was a rough year for Republicans due to a recession and Borski would be a beneficiary of the public discontent. He also was helped by some friendly redistricting that shifted some heavily Democratic wards to the 3rd. Borski scored a narrow victory of less than 3,000 votes‚Äîin the process, ousting the last Republican to represent a significant portion of Philadelphia in the House. The Borski-Dougherty battles would be fought out in this district three more times in 1992, 1998, and 2000 with Borski victorious each time. In his 20 years in Congress, Borski rose to become the second-ranking Democrat on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He was generally classed as a liberal Democrat, but opposed abortion in most cases. In 2002, the Republican-controlled State Legislature threw Borski a curve. Pennsylvania was due to lose two districts as a result of the 2000 United States Census, and the legislature dismantled his northeast Philadelphia district. Borski's home was drawn into the Montgomery County-based 13th District of two-term Democrat Joe Hoeffel. They expected that either Borski or Hoeffel would be bloodied from the resulting primary election. However, Borski decided not to run, instead retiring from Congress and allowing Hoeffel to avoid a costly primary campaign. After retiring, Borski formed his own lobbying firm, Borski Associates. Governor Ed Rendell hired Borski in 2003 to help lobby for the state of Pennsylvania in Congress.

He married a woman whose life he had saved named Debbie, and the two of them produced a son, Mark Grayson.Invincible #11 It was later revealed that Nolan was sent to Earth as a conqueror for the Viltrumite Empire, a revelation that was in stark contrast to his previous claims that his presence was to advance human technology and protect the Earth from extraterrestrial dangers. In a confrontation shortly thereafter, Omni-Man beat Mark to within an inch of his life and then fled the planet.Invicible #9‚Äì13 It was further revealed that Nolan had found a new planet over which to rule, in the hopes offsetting some of the consequences of his earthly failure.Invincible #25 Nolan's rise to power, however, was entirely peaceful. The custom of the native inhabitants, the Mantis Aliens (an insectoid people who live entirely within a nine-month span), was to simply choose the oldest among them to act as their leader. Also, as on Earth, Nolan has taken yet another native wife, Andressa, and sired a second son, Oliver (who subsequently begins to use the codename \\"Kid Omni-Man\\" when he accompanies Invincible back to Earth). The genetic differences between Viltrumites and the mantis-people were more apparent, though, than they were with humans. This caused the child to age much more slowly than his mother's species, but much faster than his father's. Omni-Man's attempts to appease the Viltrumite Empire ended in failure with his defeat and capture at the hands of his own people. He was held captive in a prison until the Empire was able to send the required Viltrumite executioners. His parting words to Mark were \\"Read my books, Mark.

They are briefly waylaid by the Viltrumite champion Conquest, an old enemy of Invincible who is killed in the ensuing battle, but not before Mark is critically injured. Nolan spends the subsequent months bonding with Oliver while Mark heals. In the final battle of the war, the anti-Viltrumite coalition is victorious, destroying the Viltrumite homeworld and scattering their enemies, although Nolan is badly wounded by the Viltrumite regent Thragg, who secretly relocates the surviving members of his race on Earth, planning to interbreed with humans to covertly rebuild the empire. Tensions mount when Thragg discovers that Nolan is a descendant of the long-dead Viltrimute king, and thus heir to the throne, provoking a fierce battle between them. Although Nolan is overpowered, the Viltrumites recognize him and rally behind him, forcing Thragg to flee. Nolan is subsequently crowned as ruler of the Viltrumite Empire.

He was known for his leadership ability and ability to play with pain, having endured a series of knee injuries during the course of his career. He later served as an assistant coach with four NFL teams. College career After playing one season of junior college ball at Cerritos College in California, Nelsen moved on to USC, where he was a key player during his first two seasons, leading the squad in total offense in both 1960 and 1961. In 1962, he split time at the position with Pete Beathard, helping the team capture the national championship. Professional career Nelsen was drafted in the 10th round of the 1963 NFL Draft by the Steelers, but saw limited action during his first two seasons. In 1965, new head coach Mike Nixon gave Nelsen the starting job. However, the struggling team finished 2-12, offering him little help, with Nelsen throwing for eight touchdowns, in addition to 17 interceptions. In the November 14, 1965 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Nelsen suffered a knee injury that plagued him the remainder of that year; he underwent surgery after the season. The following season, Nelsen suffered a knee injury against the Detroit Lions in the season's second game. Originally scheduled to be out of the lineup for six weeks, Nelsen did not return until the season's 12th week. The limited time on the field allowed him to set a league record for fewest interceptions (100 minimum passes) with just one on the campaign. In the season finale on December 18, he completed his final 11 passes to defeat the expansion Atlanta Falcons. In 1967, the injuries continued for Nelsen when during the closing moments of the September 24 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was injured following a tackle by Chuck Walker. He missed the next four games, but came off the bench to engineer a 14-10 comeback victory over the expansion New Orleans Saints on October 29. On May 14, 1968, Nelsen was traded, along with defensive back Jim Bradshaw, to the Browns. In return, the Pittsburgh Steelers received quarterback Dick Shiner, defensive tackle Frank Parker and an undisclosed draft choice.Keith Yowell, \\"1968: Steelers Deal Bill Nelsen to Browns\\", Today In Pro Football blog, May 14, 2011. http://fs64sports.blogspot.com/2011/05/1968-steelers-deal-bill-nelsen-to.html . Retrieved May 10, 2011. The trade wound up helping both teams, as within a month into the season, both Nelsen and Shiner were starting at quarterback for their new clubs. After serving as Frank Ryan's backup for three games in 1968, Nelsen was elevated to the starting role, and quickly made his mark with a shocking 30-20 upset of the previously unbeaten Baltimore Colts on October 20. By the end of the season, Nelsen had led the team to the playoffs, winning nine of his 11 starts. In 1969, Nelsen had another strong season, leading the Browns to a 10-3-1 record and a postseason berth, as well as being selected to his first and only Pro Bowl. One week after throwing for five touchdowns in a 42-10 victory over the previously unbeaten Dallas Cowboys on November 2, Nelsen spent a miserable afternoon against the Minnesota Vikings on the losing end of a 51-3 score. In addition, he briefly left that game with a pinched nerve in his throwing arm, a malady which would trouble him for the rest of the season. In game two of the 1970 NFL season, Nelsen took yet another hit to his knees in a September 27 game against the San Francisco 49ers. The injury forced him out of the game and kept him on the sidelines the following week as well. After a mid-season slump, he was replaced for one game by rookie Mike Phipps, but returned to start the final five games. Unfortunately, the Browns dropped to a 7-7 mark and missed the postseason. In 1971, Nelsen led the Browns to four wins in their first five games, but another mid-season slump once again relegated him to the bench for one game. Unlike the previous year, however, Nelsen led the team to five straight victories to again reach the playoffs. Nelsen briefly won the starting job to start the 1972 season, but gave way to Phipps after a 26-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers in the opening game. Weeks after the conclusion of the season, Nelsen underwent his fifth knee operation and announced his retirement. In 2012, the Plain Dealer named Nelsen #52 on its list of the top 100 Browns of all time.Mike Peticca, \\"Cleveland Browns' 100 best all-time players: No. 52, Bill Nelsen\\".

Coaching career On February 14, 1973, he was hired as an assistant coach for the New England Patriots, but resigned after two years. After briefly considering the Browns' open head coaching slot, he accepted an assistant position with the Atlanta Falcons. He resigned that position following the dismissal of head coach Marion Campbell. On February 9, 1977, he was named quarterback coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reuniting him with his former college coach, John McKay. He spent the next six seasons in that role until being fired amid reports of conflict with Buccaneers quarterback Doug Williams and McKay. After sitting out the 1983 NFL season, Nelsen was hired by Detroit Lions' head coach Monte Clark, a former Browns teammate, as their offensive coordinator on January 20, 1984. On April 11, 2019, Nelsen died in Orlando, Florida, at the age of 78.

While grounded in traditional pure Twelver Shi ªi doctrine, Shaykhism diverged from the Usuli school in its interpretation of key ideas such as the nature of the end times and the day of resurrection, the source of jurisprudential authority, and the proper hermeneutic to be employed in interpreting prophecy through the mystical writings of the Twelver Imams. These divergences resulted in controversy and ongoing accusations of heresy from orthodox members of the Shi ªi ulama. Today Shaykhi populations retain a minority following in Iran, Iraq Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Pakistan. In the mid-19th century, many Shaykhis converted to B√°bism and Bah√° º√≠ Faith, which regard Shaykh Ahmad and his successor Kazim Rashti highly.  Shaykh√≠ teachings  = Eschatology = The primary force behind Ahmad's teachings is the belief in the occultation of the Twelfth Imam. Believers in this doctrine, known as Twelvers, hold that the last divine ordained leader, or Imam, lives in occultation and will reappear as the promised Mahdi. Following the Mahdi's appearance, Ahmad teaches that the Imam Hussain ibn Ali will return to re- conquer the world and that the Imam Ali and prophet Muhammad will kill Satan. Al Raj'a (meaning \\"the return\\" in English) was heavily emphasized by Ahmad and is more important in Shaykhism in than in the Usuli school of Islam. =The source of knowledge and certainty= Shaykhi teachings on knowledge are similar in appearance to that of the Sufis, save that where the Sufi \\"wayfarer\\" arrogates to himself the role of interpreting and adjudicating truth, Shaykh Ahmad was clear that the final arbiter for interpretation and clarity was the 12th Imam. =Mystical symbology and the origin of the Prophet= Shaykh Ahmad's perspectives on accepted Islamic doctrines diverged in several areas, most notably on his mystical interpretation of prophesy. The sun, moon and stars of the Qur ºan's eschatological surahs are seen as allegorical, similar to Ismailis,https://ismailignosis.com/2012/12/24/esoteric-apocalypse-qiyamah- ismaili-muslim-perspectives-on-the-end-of-the-world-part-1/amp/ where common Muslim interpretation is that events involving celestial bodies will happen literally at the Day of Judgment. In other writings, Shaykh Ahmad synthesizes rather dramatic descriptions of the origin of the prophets, the primal word, and other religious themes through allusions and mystical language. Much of this language is oriented around trees, specifically the primal universal tree of Eden, described in Jewish scripture as being two trees. This primal tree is, in some ways, the universal spirit of the prophets themselves: > The symbol of the preexistent tree appears elsewhere in Shaykh Ahmad's > writings. He says, for instance, that the Prophet and the Imams exist both > on the level of unconstrained being or preexistence, wherein they are the > Complete Word and the Most Perfect Man, and on the level of constrained > being. On this second, limited plane, the cloud of the divine Will subsists > and from it emanates the Primal Water that irrigates the barren earth of > matter and of elements. Although the divine Will remains unconstrained in > essential being, its manifest aspect has now entered into limited being. > When God poured down from the clouds of Will on the barren earth, he thereby > sent down this water and it mixed with the fallow soil. In the garden of the > heaven known as as-Saqurah, the Tree of Eternity arose, and the Holy Spirit > or Universal Intellect, the first branch that grew upon it, is the first > creation among the worlds. This notion of beings with both divine and ephemeral natures presages a similar doctrine of the Manifestation in B√°bism and the Bah√° º√≠ faiths, religions whose origins are rooted in the Shaykhi spiritual tradition.  Leadership of the movement  =Shaykh Ahmad= Shaykh Ahmad, at about age forty, began to study in earnest in the Shi ªa centres of religious scholarship such as Karbala and Najaf. He attained sufficient recognition in such circles to be declared a mujtahid, an interpreter of Islamic Law. He contended with Sufi and Neo-Platonist scholars, and attained a positive reputation among their detractors. He declared that all knowledge and sciences were contained (in essential form) within the Qur ºan, and that to excel in the sciences, all knowledge must be gleaned from the Qur ºan. His leadership style and approach to interpretation draw both on traditional and theosophical methods, attempting to harmonize these two streams of Shi ªia thought in unprecedented ways, and emphasizing the validity of intuitive knowledge for religious thought. Rather than relying entirely on Ijtihad, or independent rational justification, Shakyh Ahmad claimed to derive direct guidance from the Imams. Relying entirely on individual justification for religious guidance had, he suggested, led to the introduction into Shi ªa belief of erroneous views of particular scholars. By emphasizing the role of a charismatic leader whose work was suggested to shared in the infallibility of the Imams, Shakyh Ahmad suggested that the diversity of rulings promoted by the ulama could be replaced with a singular set of doctrines-this view would later find widespread support in the Ayatollah system of modern Usulism. His views resulted in his denunciation by several learned clerics, and he engaged in many debates before moving on to Persia where he settled for a time in the province of Yazd. It was in Isfahan that most of this was written. =Sayyid Kazim Rashti= Shaykh Ahmad led the sect for only two years before his death. His undisputed successor, Kazim Rashti, also led the Shaykh√≠s until his own death (1843). Kazim did not explicitly appoint a successor. Rather, convinced that the Mahdi was in the world, he encouraged his followers to seek him out. Many of the Shaykhis expected Mull√° Husayn, one of his favorite pupils, to take on the mantle. Mull√° Husayn, however, declined the honor, insisting on obedience to Sayyid Kazim's final commands to go out in search of the Mahdi. Many of the followers of Shaykh Ahmad spread out as did Mullah Husayn. By 1844, two perspectives had emerged and camps arose based on the differing claims of two individuals. =Mullah Husayn and Siyyid Al√≠-Muhammad (The B√°b)= On May 23, 1844, during his search for the Mahdi, Mull√° Husayn encountered a young man in Shiraz named Siyyid Al√≠-Muhammad. Ali-Muhammad had visited some of Siyyid Kazim's classes, and later tellings assert that Siyyid Kazim implied a connection between his own predictions about the Mahdi and this Al√≠-Muhammad attending his class. Ali-Muhammad, in that same May 23 meeting, took the title of the B√°b and claimed to be the gate between the Shi ªa and the hidden Twelfth Imam. He only claimed to be the Imam in person a short time before his death in 1850. Mull√° Husayn accepted this claim, as did many leading Shaykhi students. Most of these went on to become the earliest B√°b√≠s. The B√°b was labeled a heretic, thrown into prison and was executed July 9, 1850. Most of the B√°b√≠s turned to the well known B√°b√≠ community leader Bah√° ºu'll√°h who founded the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in claiming that he was the one prophesied by the B√°b. Both Bab√≠s and Bah√° º√≠s regard Shaykhi thought as a precursor to their own religious traditions. A full account of Shaykhi-Babi links and the influence of Shaykhi thought on the Bab may be found in The Messiah of Shiraz by Denis MacEoin. A firsthand account of the history and relationship between Siyyid Kazim, Mullah Husayn and the B√°b from a B√°b√≠ perspective is can be found in Nab√≠l's Narrative (also known as \\"The Dawn- Breakers\\") by Muhammad-i-Zarand√≠ (surnamed Nab√≠l-i-A ªzam). = Karim Khan = Karim Khan Kermani (1809/1810-1870/1871) became the leader of the main Shaykhi group that did not follow the Bab. He became the foremost critic of the Bab, writing four essays against him.Scholarship on the Baha'i Faith, Moojan Momen Baha'u'llah in turn described Karim as \\"foolishness masquerading as knowledge\\"See Kitab-i-Aqdas, 170 Karim repudiated some of the more radical teachings of Ahsai and Rashti and moved the Shaykhi school back towards the mainstream Usuli teachings. Karim Khan Kirmani was succeeded by his son Shaykh Muhammad Khan Kirmani (1846‚Äì1906), then by Muhammad's brother Shaykh Zaynal 'Abidln Kirmani (1859‚Äì1946). Shaykh Zayn al-'Abidin Kirmani was succeeded by Shaykh Abu al-Qasim Ibrahimi (1896‚Äì1969), who was succeeded by his son 'Abd al-Rida Khan Ibrahimi who was a leader until his death.Henry Corbin History of Islamic Philosophy, Vol. II; page 353 = Muhammad Baqir Sharif Tabatabae = Mirza Muhammad Baqir Sharif Tabatabaei was born in a village named Qehi in the vicinity of Isfahan. His father, Mulla Muhammad Jafar was an admirer of Sheikh Ahmad Ahsaei. After learning the basics from his father, Mirza Muhammad Baqir travelled to Isfahan to continue his education, and resided in Nimavard School where he studied different sciences for several years. Then he met one of the admirers of Haj Muhammad Karim Kermani, (who was also known as ‚ÄúBadr‚Äù). Since Kermani was on a pilgrimage to Imam Reza's shrine in Mashhad through Yazd, he travelled to Yazd in the hope of visiting the great man in 1261 Hijri year. Since the path was dangerous, and Kermani had to return to Kerman, Mirza Muhammad Baqir accompanied him to Kerman, and resided in Ibrahimieh School, studying Islamic theology. He soon reached a level where he could teach the lessons of his grand master. After several years, the date of which is not known, Kermani sent him to the city of Naein for preaching and guidance, where he spent some years preaching and proselytizing. Mirza Muhammad Baqir immediately gained the attention and respect of the Sheikhieh members of Naein, Anarak, Jandaq, Biabanak and the surrounding cities. Then he returned to Kerman, Until Kermani left for a pilgrimage to Karbala in 1283 Hijri year. When Kermani arrived in Hamedan, because of the great number of Sheikhieh adherents, and also lack of great leaders after the demise of Mullah Abdulsamad Hamedani, he appointed Mirza Muhammad Baqir as a leader in his absence, and continued his pilgrimage to Karbala. Mirza Muhammad Baqir stayed in Hamedan since his mentor had mandated it. He engaged in preaching, proselytizing and teaching Islamic principles for 32 years. He was a great leader and protector for the Sheikhieh members after the demise of his mentor, until 1315 Hijri. In Eid al-Fitr of 1315, when the riots of Hamedan occurred, he migrated to Jandaq village and stayed there for the rest of his fruitful life, teaching Islamic principles and preaching. Mirza Muhammad Baqir died on the 23rd of Sha ºban 1319, at the age of 80. After Maqrib and Isha prayer. This great man was buried in the same village, but after two years, his body was moved to Mashhad, to be laid to rest in Imam Reza's shrine, next to his Imam. He has left more than 190 manuscripts and almost 2000 sermons and teachings. Relationship to B√°bism and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith B√°bis and then Bah√° º√≠s see Shaykhism as a spiritual ancestor of their movement, preparing the way for the B√°b and eventually Bah√° ºu'll√°h. In this view Shaykhism has outlived its eschatological purpose and is no longer anymore relevant.  Modern Shaykhism  The current leader of the Shaykhiya is Zein al-Abedin Ebrahimi from Iran which become the leader of Shaykhiya when the last leader Mr. Ali al-Musawi died in Iraq. Ali al-Musawi was the man who heads a community with followers in Iraq - mainly Basrah and Karbala - Iran and the Persian Gulf. Basrah has a significant Shaykhi minority, and their mosque is one of the largest in the city holding up to 12,000 people. The Shaykhiya were resolutely apolitical and hence were allowed relative freedom under Saddam Hussein. Since the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and subsequent Iraqi Civil War they have been targeted by Iraqi nationalists who accused them of being Saudis on the grounds that Ahmad al-Ahsai was from present-day Saudi Arabia. They responded by creating an armed militia and asking all local political groups to sign a pact allowing them to live in peace. This was done at the al-Zahra conference in April 2006.Where Is Iraq Heading? Lessons from Basra , International Crisis Group, 2007-06-25, accessed on 2007-07-03 In a move away from their traditional apolitical stance, a Shaykhi political party stood in the Basra governorate election, 2009; they came third, winning 5% of the votes and 2 out of 35 seats.The Candidate Lists Are Out: Basra More Fragmented, Sadrists Pursuing Several Strategies?, Historiae, 2008-12-12 Shaykhi amongst Shia islam References Further reading * Corbin, Henry (1977).

It is published in the United Kingdom by Athletics Weekly Limited and covers news, results, fixtures, coaching and product advice for all aspects of track and field, cross-country, road racing and race walking.  Jimmy Green years (1945 to 1987)  The magazine was started as a monthly by PW \\"Jimmy\\" Green in 1945, with the first few issues produced from the back bedroom of a bungalow in Kent which Green shared with his wife, Pam. With post-war paper rationing still in force, Green used a mixture of determination and devilment to launch the first, self- published edition. It was numbered Volume II Issue I, but this was a deliberate error to fool the government into thinking the magazine had existed before the war. There was, of course, never a Volume I. Green was also told by athletics and publishing experts that the idea would never work. ‚ÄúI thanked them for their advice and completely ignored it. I was pig headed,‚Äù said Green. Green's magazine went weekly in January 1950, published on Fridays, and has never failed to come out since. In 1968, Green (who died in 1998, aged 88) passed the editorship to the enthusiastic and knowledgeable Mel Watman, who in a near-20-year reign steered the title to some success and continued to build its reputation for accuracy and authority. Independently published by Kent Art Printers in a distinctive A5, pocket-sized format, the magazine reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1980s - coinciding with the marathon running boom following the first London Marathon in 1981 - selling some 25,000 copies per week.  Emap years (1987 to 1999)  The title was bought in 1987 by Emap and moved from Kent to Peterborough, where the management sought to repeat the publishing success of its Smash Hits pop title and re-launched AW as an A4 title aimed at teenagers. Emap made some business decisions that decreased the quality of the product and damaged the magazine's reputation. First, the previous editorial staff was not retained by Emap thus losing the experience and inside connections these employees had fostered through the years. On top of this the inexperienced editorial team had to deal with a publication date brought forward to Wednesdays, requiring a speedy and expensive turnaround of each weekend's results. The result of these decisions was that lucrative subscriptions were lost and Athletics Weekly sales nosedived. By late 1989, one-third of sales had been lost and Keith Nelson, Emap's choice as editor, was moved on. Aware of its loyal following's disgruntlement with the re-launch of Athletics Weekly, in 1989 Eddie Kulukundis funded the launch of a rival title, Athletics Today, jointly edited by Randall Northam and Mel Watman: for the first time in its existence, Athletics Weekly now faced competition. Despite the sport's continued successes through the 1990s and the ultimate demise of its rival in 1993, Athletics Weekly struggled in vain to regain its reputation for comprehensiveness and accuracy.  Descartes years (1999 to 2010)  After a decade's ownership, Emap admitted defeat and in April 1999 licensed the title to Descartes Publishing, a company established by businessman and athletics enthusiast Matthew Fraser Moat for the purpose. Descartes kept the title in Peterborough and went on to purchase the title outright in 2003. In February 2005 the magazine was awarded Sports BrandLeader status and in December 2005 Athletics Weekly celebrated its 60th birthday with a charity calendar and a special 100 page edition. In 2006 the title changed its publication date back to a Thursday, and increased in size to 64 pages a week; in 2007 an online digital version was launched and in 2009 Athletics Weekly became the first magazine in the world to have all its content commercially available on the iPhone. In 2010 the AW app was relaunched for the iPad. A sister company, Athletics Data Limited, was formed to manage the commercial rights of Athletics Weekly's results data and in 2009 Athletics Data was appointed to run Power of 10, a statistical website, for UK Athletics. Taking advantage of the renewed interest in the sport generated by London 2012 and Usain Bolt, the magazine was \\"highly commended\\" in the \\"Brand Extension of The Year\\" category at the 2009 Independent Publisher Awards and won a \\"Media Pioneer Award\\" at the 2010 Specialist Media Show. In January 2010, the magazine celebrated 60 years as a weekly magazine.  Athletics Weekly years (2010 to date)  In May 2010, ownership of the magazine passed to a new company \\"Athletics Weekly Limited\\", with a new publisher Richard Hughes.

The groundwork was laid in a series of personal meetings of king and pope in Bologna, 11‚Äì15 December 1515. The concordat was signed in Rome on 18 August 1516. The Concordat explicitly superseded the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438), which had proved ineffective in guaranteeing the privileges of the Church in France, where bishoprics and abbacies had been wrangled over even before the Parlement of Paris: \\"hardly anywhere were elections held in due form\\", R. Aubenas observes,Aubenas, \\"The Papacy and the Catholic Church\\", in The New Cambridge Modern History, 1957:85. \\"for the king succeeded in foisting his own candidates upon the electors by every conceivable means, not excluding the most ruthless\\". The Concordat permitted the Pope to collect all the income that the Catholic Church made in France, and the King of France was confirmed in his right to tithe the clerics and to restrict their right of appeal to Rome. The Concordat confirmed the King of France's right to nominate appointments to benefice (archbishops, bishops, abbots and priors), enabling the Crown, by controlling its personnel, to decide who was to lead the Gallican Church.Holt, Mack P., \\"The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629,\\", Cambridge University Press, 1995: pages 10-13. Canonical installation of those church officers was reserved to the Pope; thus the agreement confirmed the papal veto of any leader the King of France chose who might be deemed truly unqualified. The Concordat confirmed the Apostolic Camera's right to collect annates, the first year's revenue from each benefice, a right that when abused led to shuffling of prelates among dioceses. The fiction of elections to bishopric by canons and to abbacies by monks was discontinued. On Francis's part, it was at last firmly conceded that the Pope's powers were not subject to any council (the previous French position had been to support the decisions of the Council of Basel), an affirmation of the papal position in the long- crushed Conciliar Movement, which was in the process of being condemned at the contemporaneous Fifth Lateran Council (1512‚Äì17), which confirmed the Concordat. Aftermath Though the Concordat of Bologna left many issues unsolved, it provided the ground rules for the limited Reformation in France: the sons of Francis and Catherine de' Medici saw no advantage to the Crown in any gestures towards Reformation. The king of France had enormous powers to direct the Church's wealth and to provide sinecures in the offices of bishops and abbots in commendam for his faithful followers among the powerful aristocracy. The Concordat ended any vestige of the elective principle in which the monks or cathedral canons chose the abbot or bishop: there were some protests from the disenfranchised communities whose approval of candidates had for some time devolved into a mere pro forma. It allowed the King to maintain control of the Church as well as the State. For many years, the kings of France would struggle to keep the Catholic Church in power, as it was filled with supporters of their policies. This would lead to persecution of non- Catholics under Francis I, Henry II, Francis II, and Charles IX. The religious intolerance would lead to the civil wars in France called the Wars of Religion, some religious freedom in the form of an edict of toleration, the Edict of Saint-Germain issued by Charles IX's regent in 1562 and finally the Edict of Nantes.

Helena's relic 260x260pxA part of this sign, relic known as the ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù or \\"Titulus Crucis\\", kept in the Cappella delle Reliquie in Rome, Italy. Saint Helena, Roman Empress and mother of Emperor Constantine the Great, went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land and reportedly discovered the True Cross and many other relics which were donated to the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (\\"Holy Cross in Jerusalem\\") which she had built in Rome about AD 325. Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso was made cardinal priest of the church in 1124 and some time before he became Pope Lucius II in 1144 he renovated the church and had the relic deposited in a box that bears his seal as a cardinal.Joe Nickell, Relics of the Christ (The University Press of Kentucky, 1 March 2007) , pp. 87‚Äì8. The box was apparently forgotten until 1 February 1492, when workers restoring a mosaic discovered it hidden behind a brick that was inscribed Titulus Crucis. It was the same day that news reached Rome of the downfall of the Moors in Spain. Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza, Spanish cardinal priest of Santa Croce at the time, encouraged veneration of the rediscovered relic. Other Jerusalem relics Some Christian pilgrims who visited Jerusalem in the centuries between Helena and Pope Lucius reported seeing Christ's titulus there: Egeria reported that in AD 383 \\"A silver-gilt casket is brought in which is the holy wood of the Cross. The casket is opened and (the wood) is taken out, and both the wood of the Cross and the title are placed upon the table.\\"Latin original: \\"et affertur loculus argenteus deauratus, in quo est lignum sanctum crucis, aperitur et profertur, ponitur in mensa tam lignum crucis quam titulus.\\" (Itinerarium Egeriae, 37, 1) Antoninus of Piacenza in the 6th century described a titulus of \\"nut\\" wood with the inscription \\"Hic est rex Iudaeorum\\" (\\"Here is the king of the Jews\\"), corresponding to . Authenticity In 1997, the German author and historian Michael Hesemann performed an investigation of the relic. Hesemann presented the inscription of the title to seven experts on Hebrew, Greek and Latin palaeography: Gabriel Barkay of the Israel Antiquities Authority, Hanan Eshel, Ester Eshel and Leah Di Segni of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel Roll and Benjamin Isaac of the University of Tel Aviv and Carsten Peter Thiede of Paderborn/Germany and the University of Beer Sheva, Israel. According to Hesemann, none of the consulted experts found any indication of a mediaeval or late antique forgery. They all dated it in the timeframe between the 1st and the 3rd‚Äì4th century AD, with a majority of experts preferring, and none of them excluding, the 1st century. Hesemann concluded that it is very well possible that the Titulus Crucis is indeed the authentic relic.-The title of the cross of Jesus Christ? By Michael Hesemann Carsten Peter Thiede suggested that the Titulus Crucis is likely to be a genuine part of the Cross, written by a Jewish scribe. He cites that the order of the languages match what is historically plausible rather than the order shown in the canonical New Testament because had it been a counterfeit, the forger would surely have remained faithful to the biblical text.'TITULUS CRUCIS'..Evidence that the Actual Sign Posted Above The Lord on The Cross Has Been Located? Joe Nickell refers to this argument as \\"trying to psychoanalyze the dead,\\" saying that \\"Forgers‚Äîparticularly of another era‚Äîmay do something cleverer or dumber or simply different from what we would expect.\\" In 2002, the Roma Tre University conducted radiocarbon dating tests on the artifact, and it was shown to have been made between 980 and 1146 AD. The uncalibrated radio-carbon date was 1020 ¬± 30 BP, calibrated as AD 996‚Äì1023 (1œÉ) and AD 980‚Äì1146 (2œÉ), using INTCAL98. These results were published in the peer-reviewed journal Radiocarbon. The Titulus Crucis recovered from the residence of Helena is therefore most likely a medieval artifact; an Italian classical scholar Maria Rigato discussed a possibility that it is a copy of the now-lost original {Rigato ML. 2002.

Life and career Stursberg was born in Chefoo, China, the son of Mary Ellen (n√©e Shaw) and Walter Arthur Stursberg, who was working for the Chinese postal service. His father, was born in Canada to a German father from the Rhineland and an English mother, while his mother was born in China to an English father and a Japanese mother. At the age of seven his parents took him on a world tour before returning to China. At age 11 Stursberg was sent to a boarding school in England. Several years later his parents returned to Canada. Peter joined them and went on to graduate from West Hill High School in Montreal. He then took his British matriculation at Bedford School before returning to Montreal in 1930 to attend McGill University where he studied sciences and wrote for the McGill Daily. As a result of the Great Depression, Stursberg's parents suffered a reversal in their economic status and moved to a farm on Vancouver Island. Stursberg left university to follow them west and worked at a number of odd jobs including working in a logging camp, on farms and odd jobs. In 1934 he found a job as agricultural editor of the Victoria Daily Times. Curious about the situation in Europe, he embarked on a tour of the continent in 1938 visiting France, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Soviet Union where he was briefly detained for a visa violation. He filed stories as a freelance reporter during his tour and was hired on the strength of these pieces as a war reporter for the London Daily Herald. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he returned to Canada to join the Vancouver Daily Province. He joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Vancouver in 1941 as a news editor. In 1942 he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy before becoming a war correspondent for the CBC later that year. Stursberg spent his career as a foreign correspondent, newspaper editor, television newscaster and commentator, and author. He was recognised as one of the best Canadian correspondents of the Second World War, reporting for CBC Radio from the front lines in Italy and France. He published a book in 1944, Journey Into Victory, based on his experience. In 1945 he left the CBC to return to the Daily Herald as a foreign correspondent. He rejoined CBC in 1950 as the network's United Nations correspondent, leaving again in 1956 to join the Toronto Daily Star as Ottawa editorial correspondent. He left journalism in 1957 to work as a researcher and speechwriter for Prime Minister John George Diefenbaker who subsequently appointed him press officer to the Canadian Trade Mission to the United Kingdom in 1957 and later, in 1958, secretary of the Trade Mission in Ottawa. Stursburg joined Ernest Bushnell to apply for a license for what became CJOH Television in Ottawa. When the station was launched in 1961 he became a television newscaster and commentator for CJOH and was one of the initial co-anchors of the CTV National News. He remained a news commentator for CJOH and CTV until his retirement from broadcasting in 1973. He wrote several books on Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson: Diefenbaker: Leadership Gained, 1956-62 (1975) and Diefenbaker: Leadership Lost, 1962-67 (1976), Lester Pearson and the Dream of Unity (1978) and Lester Pearson and the American Dilemma (1980). In 1980 he joined the Department of Canadian Studies at Simon Fraser University as an Instructor and was an adjunct professor there from 1982 to 1988. In 1996 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for having \\"helped Canadians to be better informed about themselves and their place in the world\\". Stursberg's final book, No Foreign Bones in China (2002), details his family's complex relationship with his country of birth: \\"Stursberg recreated the story of his family in China for No Foreign Bones in China, recalling the turbulent birth of modern China through the Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, two world wars and the rise of Mao. It traces the fortunes of Captain Samuel Lewis Shaw, a merchant seaman, who arrived in China in the 1830s. He settled in Foochow and married a Japanese woman, Peter Stursberg's grandmother, to whom the book is dedicated. The Shaw children grew up in Pagoda Anchorage, the heart of the Chinese tea trade. The title refers to the fury of the Chinese over the Korean War. They expelled all foreigners and even dug up their bones, including the bones of Stursberg's grandfather and grandmother.\\" Through his ancestors, Captain Shaw and his Japanese wife, Stursberg is related to former British Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith. Peter Stursberg is the father of former CBC executive Richard Stursberg. His granddaughter, Trina Maus, is a news reporter for CTV. Peter Stursberg died in 2014, on his 101st birthday, in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Hamblin, based in Denver, Colorado, is the author of the books Pick a Better Country: An Unassuming Colored Guy Speaks His Mind about America and Plain Talk and Common Sense from the Black Avenger.  Early career  The child of immigrant parents from Barbados, Hamblin is a policeman's son. He served in the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division before becoming a photographer for the Detroit Free Press.Grunt.com In the late 1960s Hamblin was a producer and film cameraman with the public television channel in Detroit, WTVS, Channel 56. An event Hamblin captured exclusively was the release of poet John Sinclair from prison after serving time for marijuana possession. Hamblin began his radio career in the 1970s. Hamblin has said he was once sympathetic to the radical left, including the Black Panthers, and gave them favorable coverage. He eventually came to the opinion the left had failed to bring about the type of America it spoke of, and he began to move to the conservative side of the spectrum. Hamblin is a licensed fixed-wing pilot and a motorcycle owner. He is a father and grandfather.  The Ken Hamblin Show  Hamblin had a long-running local talk program on powerful KOA radio in Denver, a clear-channel station heard across the western and central United States. Hamblin hosted the early evening shift, which he worked the evening of June 18, 1984, when Alan Berg, one of the station's biggest and most controversial hosts, was gunned down. He gained national attention when his show, then carried on another Denver radio station, was broadcast on C-SPAN during the early 1990s. He was heard on KNUS and KXKL radio in Denver, as well as across the nation. After his show was syndicated, he was heard across the United States on about 200 radio stations. In 1999, Hamblin was named one of Colorado's Top 100 most influential media personalities. Hamblin's show had several unique features: playing various versions of the Star Spangled Banner at the beginning of the show; playing Taps for fallen law enforcement officers; announcing the execution of convicts on death row, often with a clip from the movie Unforgiven, saying \\"It's a hell of a thing killin' a man; you take away all he's got, and all he's ever gonna have.\\" The execution segment was notable for having \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", sung by Queen. Hamblin frequently referred to liberals as \\"Egg-sucking dogs\\", and sometimes challenged listeners to call in to, \\"Name one major American city that improved morally, socially, and economically after the city elected a liberal black mayor ('You can't do it')\\". He has also been an outspoken critic of Louis Farrakan and the Nation of Islam, challenging those unhappy with the United States to \\"pick a better country\\" and go live there. Life after leaving public life As of 2010, Hamblin was reported to be living in Douglas County, Colorado and now spends much of his time traveling with his wife Sue.

He spent the years 1397-99 in Ireland, attempting with little success to persuade the Gaelic chieftains to accept Richard II as their overlord. However, he supported Henry Bolingbroke on his return to England to become King Henry IV, only to be attainted (deprived of his Earldom because of a capital crime) for his role in the death of Thomas of Woodstock.

Born in Piacenza to a Milanese family, he joined the Jesuits in 1634. After completing his mathematical and theological studies, he moved to Rome, where he assumed the position of professor at the Collegio Romano. He was given the chair in mathematics after teaching philosophy and theology. Casati in Sweden In 1651, Casati was sent on a mission to Stockholm in order to gauge the sincerity of Christina of Sweden's intention to become Catholic. He subsequently returned to his post at Rome. In 1677, he moved to the Jesuit College in Parma, where he remained until his death. Casati's Terra machinis mota The astronomical work Terra machinis mota (1658) imagines a dialogue between Galileo, Paul Guldin, and Marin Mersenne on various intellectual problems of cosmology, geography, astronomy and geodesy. For example, they discuss how to determine the Earth's dimensions, floating bodies, the phenomena of capillarity, and also describe the experiment on the vacuum made by Otto von Guericke in 1654. The work is remarkable for the fact that it represents Galileo in a positive light, in a Jesuit work, only 25 years after Galileo's condemnation by the Church. Casati and Theories on the Vacuum Casati discussed the hypothesis of horror vacui, that nature abhors a vacuum, in his thesis Vacuum proscriptum, published in Genoa in 1649. Casati confuted the existence of both vacuum and atmospheric pressure, but he did not rely entirely on scientific observation, and refers to Catholic thought in order to back his claims. The absence of anything implied the absence of God, and hearkened back to the void prior to the story of creation in the book of Genesis (see Vacuum: historical interpretation).

Sniderman was also a major promoter of Canadian music including involvement in pushing for the Canadian content (CANCON) broadcast regulations and creating the Juno Awards. Life and career Born in Toronto, Ontario, Sniderman grew up in its Jewish enclave known as Kensington Market. He attended high school at Harbord Collegiate Institute and started selling records in his brother Sidney's store, Sniderman Radio Sales and Service, in 1937. In 1959 he opened his first store on Toronto's Yonge Street, and then moved it to the iconic 347 Yonge Street flagship store location in 1961. In 1969, he started franchising the store. He retired in 2000 and turned over ownership of the business to his sons, Bobby and Jason, and Sid's daughters Lana and Arna. The flagship Toronto store that bore his name closed in 2007 and its distinctive fa√ßade was declared a heritage site by the city. Following the closure, Sniderman expressed his support for Ryerson University's bid to expropriate the Yonge Street property if his children and nieces failed to negotiate a deal to sell the property to the university. In the end, Ryerson reached a deal to purchase the property from the family. Awards and honours On October 20, 1976, he was invested into the Order of Canada. He was appointed to the Order's third tier, Member, for \\"found[ing] the Recordings Archive Library at the University of Toronto, now the largest of its kind in Canada. For his constant support of Canadian talent and concern for the preservation of our cultural heritage\\". Sniderman was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997. Sam Sniderman himself remained an active participant in the Canadian music industry until his death. Always a believer in the \\"more is more\\" philosophy, he established the Sniderman Sound Recording Archive at the University of Toronto's School of Music, ensuring that it is \\"as big as possible.\\" Sniderman spoke at the 2006 East Coast Music Awards. In 1999, Sniderman received the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts, a companion award of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards, for his tireless support of Canadian musicians.

The current Director-General is Paul Reid. History The Executive was established by the Health Act, 2004 and came into official operation on 1 January 2005. It replaced the ten regional Health Boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and a number of other different agencies and organisations. The Minister for Health retained overall responsibility for the Executive in Government. The HSE adopted a regional structure (HSE Dublin Mid- Leinster, HSE Dublin North East, HSE South and HSE West). A new grouping of hospitals was announced by the Irish Minister for Health, Dr. James Reilly TD in May 2013, as part of a restructure of Irish public hospitals and a goal of delivering better patient care: *Dublin North East (subsequently renamed RCSI Hospitals) *Dublin Midlands (subsequently renamed Dublin Midlands Hospital Group) *Dublin East (subsequently renamed Ireland East Hospital Group) *South/South West (subsequently renamed South/Southwest Hospital Group) *West/North West (subsequently renamed Saolta University Health Care Group) *Mid West (subsequently renamed UL Hospitals Group) A new arrangement of 90 primary care networks was announced in October 2014. News and criticism The HSE is frequently portrayed by the Irish media as an inefficient, top- heavy and excessively bureaucratic organisation. The Irish health system has been involved in a number of serious health scandals, for example relating to cancer misdiagnoses in 2008. The HSE has also been the subject of criticism for cutbacks, service cancellations etc., but has indicated that it is making good progress in saving costs and achieving its required 'break-even' budget position for 2010. In the same month, the Irish Medical Organisation stated that patients awaiting a HSE medical card were waiting up to six months to receive their card, and that their health was being put at risk as they could not afford medicines that they would have otherwise obtained had they received their card. The HSE has since announced a new online system for medical card applications that will reduce turnaround time for routine applications to 15 days. In May 2011, key forensic evidence in up to 25 sexual-assault cases may be challenged in court because of a major administrative blunder by the HSE. The victims ‚Äì some as young as 14 ‚Äì were told by Garda√≠ about the incident, in which a nurse who carried out their forensic tests was unregistered. This could lead to the evidence being challenged. In May 2018, in the midst of the CervicalCheck misdiagnoses controversy, Tony O'Brien announced his resignation as director-general of the HSE with effect from close of business on 11 May.

This is in contrast to a \\"pedicled\\" flap in which the tissue is left partly attached to the donor site (\\"pedicle\\") and simply transposed to a new location; keeping the \\"pedicle\\" intact as a conduit to supply the tissue with blood. Various types of tissue may be transferred as a \\"free flap\\" including skin and fat, muscle, nerve, bone, cartilage (or any combination of these), lymph nodes and intestinal segments. An example of \\"free flap\\" could be a \\"free toe transfer\\" in which the great toe or the second toe is transferred to the hand to reconstruct a thumb. For all \\"free flaps\\", the blood supply is reconstituted using microsurgical techniques to reconnect the artery (brings blood into the flap) and vein (allows blood to flow out of the flap). Free autologous tissue transfer is performed by many surgical specialties. Indications Free flaps are used to reconstruct tissue defects. Particularly when postoperative radiotherapy is indicated, vascularized free tissue is preferred over non- vascularized free tissue. Breast reconstruction: *Aesthetic (cosmetic) reconstruction: Most commonly creating a breast after a mastectomy. This may happen at the time of mastectomy or at a later date. Free flaps are usually only done if a TRAM flap is not possible. Plastic surgeons usually perform these surgeries. Patients with Bell's palsy can have their face re-animated using \\"free functioning muscle flaps\\". '' Hand reconstruction: *Reconstruction of paralyzed face or hand using functioning free muscle flaps. Head and Neck reconstruction: When reconstructing complex head and neck defects, the reconstruction often requires bone and soft tissue from a distant donor site to be harvested. Functional reconstruction in the head and neck area often requires reconstruction of the oral cavity, the jawbone and the dental occlusion. Type of defects include: *Reconstruction of post-traumatic defects: Some areas of the body has missing tissue either from a trauma or from some existing wound. This may include areas on the leg where bone is exposed or any other area on the body that needs soft tissue coverage. *Reconstruction of a defect following removal of a tumor in the mouth or elsewhere: Soft tissue resection requires soft tissue reconstruction. Composite (soft tissue and hard tissue) resection requires composite reconstruction. Soft tissue flaps include the radial forearm free flap and the ALT (anterolateral thigh) free flap amongst others. Composite free flaps include the fibular free flap, the DCIA free flap, the scapular free flap and the composite radial free flap amongst others. When the cancer resection involves a part of the lower jaw, depending on the patients age and the patients co-morbidities one composite free flap will be preferred over the others for reconstruction of the defect. *Reconstruction of esophageal (food-pipe) continuity using segments of intestine Surgical Steps during \\"free autologous tissue transfer\\" # A defect is created surgically (either following removal of a tumor or following cleansing of a wound) # An incision is made over the area from where the flap will be taken. # The flap is dissected and freed from the surrounding tissue. # At least one vein and one artery (which constitutes the vascular pedicle) are dissected. # The vein and artery (vascular pedicle) are divided, separating the flap from the rest of the body. # Before the pedicle is divided, the area the flap will be re-attached to is prepared by identifying a recipient artery and vein. # The free flap is brought up to the defect area, and the vein and artery from the flap (vascular pedicle) are anastomosed (re- connected) to the vein and artery identified in the wound. The anastomosis is done using a microscope or a \\"loupe\\", hence it is termed \\"microsurgery\\" # The free flap is sutured to the defect, while it is monitored to ensure the blood vessels remain patent (i.e. the vessels have good blood flow). # The donor site area is closed primarily. Sometimes a Split Thickness Skin graft (STSG) may be performed and placed on top of the defect site and/or the donor site. Postoperative Complications/Sequalae The most common serious complication of a free flap is loss of the venous outflow (e.g. a clot forms in the vein that drains the blood from the flap). Loss of arterial supply is serious too and both will cause necrosis (death) of the flap. Close monitoring of the flap both by nurses and by the surgeon is mandatory following the completion of the operation.F. H√∂lzle, D. L√∂ffelbein, D. Nolte, K.-D. Wolff: Free flap monitoring using simultaneous non-invasive laser Doppler flowmetry and tissue spectrophotometry. J Craniomaxillofac Surg. (2006) 34: 25-33.F. H√∂lzle, A. Rau, D. J. Loeffelbein, M.

(2010) 37: 21-28. If detected early, loss of either the venous or arterial blood supply may be corrected by operative intervention. Many times an implantable Doppler probe or other devices can be installed during surgery to provide better monitoring in the post-operative period. The Doppler probe can be removed before discharge from the hospital. Usually the harvest of a \\"free flap\\" is performed in such a fashion to cause the least amount of disability. Despite this some disability may occur following removal of this tissue from the \\"donor site\\". Other complications/sequalae which may occur with any surgery are also possible, including infection and pain.

After their use by the RAF, four Fortress Is were later sent to the Middle East, where, until May 1942, they undertook night attacks against enemy positions at Benghazi and Tobruk. In February to April 1942, five of the remaining Fortress Is in Europe were transferred to RAF Coastal Command. Royal Air Force Station Polebrook or more simply RAF Polebrook is a former Royal Air Force station located east-south-east of Oundle, at Polebrook, Northamptonshire, England. The airfield was built on Rothschild estate land starting in August 1940. It was from Polebrook that the United States Army Air Forces' Eighth Air Force carried out its first heavy bomb group (Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress) combat mission on 17 August 1942, and from which Major Clark Gable flew combat missions in 1943. History RAF Polebrook was the first airfield to be completed out of a number in the Northamptonshire/Huntingdonshire area which were laid down for RAF Bomber Command during late 1940 and early 1941. Like other airfields in the construction program at the time, Polebrook was built by George Wimpey & Co., Limited. The initial construction was of three runways, the concrete runway lengths were 08-26 at 1,280 yards, 14-32 at 1,200 yards and 02-20, 1,116 yards. In addition, thirty square hardstands most on the eastern side, were reached by very long access tracks. The weapons store was unusual in that it lay within the perimeter track at the southern end. One Type J and two Type T-2 hangars were erected on the technical site outside the northern perimeter with the domestic sites dispersed in woodland beyond. =Royal Air Force use= One of the first units to operate from the airfield was No. 90 Squadron RAF, which carried out operational trials from June 1941 to February 1942. Several of the hardstands and taxiways were still under construction when the squadron arrived. No. 90 Squadron was equipped with the American B-17C, called \\"Fortress 1\\" by the RAF. Although the US Army Air Forces did not consider the B-17C as being combat ready (the E-version was already under procurement as the result of combat reports from Europe), the RAF was sufficiently desperate in 1941 that these planes were immediately pressed into front-line service. The Fortresses were used for very high-altitude attacks in daylight, the first operation from Polebrook being flown on 8 July 1941 when three Fortresses were dispatched on a raid to Wilhelmshaven. Engine trouble forced one of the planes to divert to a second target, but the other two went on to attack the naval barracks at Wilhelmshaven from an altitude of 30,000 feet. Unfortunately, the planes were not able to hit anything from such extreme altitudes. In addition, their crews found that the temperatures at this altitude were so cold that their defensive machine guns froze up when they tried to fire them. However, all planes returned safely to base. Their last raid launched from Polebrook was on 2 September 1941. RAF Fortresses had flown 22 attacks against targets such as Bremen, Brest, Emden, Kiel, Oslo, and Rotterdam. A total of 39 planes had been dispatched, out of which eighteen planes had aborted and two had been forced to bomb secondary targets because of mechanical problems. Eight Fortresses had been destroyed in combat or lost in accidents. Discouraged by these losses, the RAF decided to abandon daylight bombing raids over Europe. Although two Fortresses were missing from operations, the only loss resulting from a raid flown from Polebrook involved a badly battle-damaged aircraft that crash landed at a south-coast airfield. As a result of RAF experience with the Fortress, it was determined that there was a need for vast improvements in defensive gunnery, a need for operating the Fortresses in greater numbers in tighter formations for better defensive firepower, and a need for better and more intensive crew training. Nevertheless, their British crews generally were quite pleased with the Fortress I, regarding it as easy to fly, very maneuverable, and aerodynamically stable in the bomb run. While at Polebrook, No. 90 was then the sole operational squadron assigned to No. 8 Group RAF and, before it was disbanded on 12 February 1942, its remaining aircraft and crews were only involved in experimentation and training. The short runways at Polebrook were found to be unsatisfactory for the operation of the heavy- loaded, four-engine B-17. In 1942 the airfield was improved to Class A airfield standards. The main runway was extended to 1,950 yards and the secondary runways to 1,400 yards each. In addition, additional hardstands were constructed, increasing the total number from 30 to 50. This enlargement resulted in the unusual situation that the ammunition storage area was inside the extended perimeter track. The living and communal sites were dispersed in woodlands north of the airfield. They provided accommodations to about 2,000 personnel. =United States Army Air Forces use= From 12 December 1943 to 12 June 1945, Polebrook served as headquarters for the 94th Combat Bombardment Wing of the 1st Bombardment Division. It was designated USAAF Station 110. 97th Bombardment Group (Heavy) RAF Polebrook control tower, 20 March 1945. Note the use of a B-17 nose plexiglass. Also shows Signals Square Boeing B-17E Fortress Serial 41-2578. This aircraft was the oldest and longest serving B-17 in the Eighth Air Force. While with the 97th Bomb Group on 17 August 1942, this was the lead aircraft in the first Eighth Air Force heavy bombing mission. Later, this aircraft was used for training combat replacement crews with the 11th Combat Crew Replacement Unit at RAF Bovingdon until 1945. Boeing B-17G-95-BO Fortress 43-38846, 351st Bombardment Group On 28 June 1942, RAF Polebrook was officially turned over to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the airbase became the base of the 97th Bombardment Group, the first USAAF heavy bomber organization to arrive in the UK. The 97th BG was assigned to the 1st Combat Wing, at RAF Bassingbourn. Its operational squadrons were divided between Polebrook and RAF Grafton Underwood: * 340th Bombardment Squadron (RAF Polebrook) * 341st Bombardment Squadron (RAF Polebrook) * 342nd Bombardment Squadron (RAF Grafton Underwood) * 343rd Bombardment Squadron (RAF Grafton Underwood) The 97th Bomb Group is famous for flying the first All American Flying Fortress bombing mission originating from Grafton Underwood against German occupied territory in Europe on August 17, 1942 by attacking the railway marshalling yards at Sotteville-l√®s-Rouen in France. The lead aircraft in the first flight group of six B-17's was Butcher Shop, which was copiloted by the Group Commander Colonel Frank A. Armstrong, and piloted by the squadron commander of the 340th Captain Paul W. Tibbets (who later flew the Enola Gay to Hiroshima Japan on the first atomic bomb mission). The lead aircraft in the second flight group of six B-17's was B-17E Yankee Doodle 41-9023, which was copiloted by 2nd Lt. John R. Dowswell and piloted by Captain Rudolph Emil \\"Rudy\\" Flack the squadron commander of the 414th, Grafton Underwood base commander and mission commander (http://www.americanairmuseum.com/person/246743), and who carried Brig. General Ira C. Eaker the commander of the VIII Bomber Command as an observer on board his Flying Fortress. The 97th BG conducted a total of 16 missions from Polebrook and Grafton Underwood, attacking airfields, marshalling yards, industries, naval installations, and other targets in France and the Low Countries. The group sortied 247 aircraft, dropped 395 tons of bombs on Nazi- controlled territory, and lost 14 aircraft. On 21 October 1942, the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to the Twelfth Air Force in the Mediterranean theatre and Polebrook was unoccupied until April 1943. 351st Bombardment Group (Heavy) On 15 April 1943, the 351st Bomb Group arrived at RAF Polebrook. It was assigned to the 94th Combat Wing, also at Polebrook. The group tail code was a \\"Triangle J\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 508th Bombardment Squadron (YB) * 509th Bombardment Squadron (RQ) * 510th Bombardment Squadron (TU) * 511th Bombardment Squadron (DS) The 351st's first completed combat mission took place on 14 May 1943, when 18 B-17s targeted a German Luftwaffe airfield at Kortrijk, Belgium. As the war progressed, the 351st operated primarily against strategic objectives in Germany, striking such targets as ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt, communications at Mayen, marshalling yards at Koblenz, a locomotive and tank factory at Hanover, industries at Berlin, bridges at Cologne, an armaments factory at Mannheim, and oil refineries at Hamburg. The group also struck harbor facilities, submarine installations, airfields, V-weapon sites, and power plants in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway. The 351st Received a Distinguished Unit Citation for performance of 9 October 1943 when an aircraft factory in Germany was accurately bombed in spite of heavy flak and pressing enemy interceptors. It received another DUC for its part in the successful attack of 11 January 1944 on aircraft factories in central Germany. The group participated in the intensive air campaign against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20‚àí25 February 1944. In addition to its strategic missions, the group often operated in support of ground forces and attacked interdictory targets. Bombed in support of the Battle of Normandy in June 1944 and the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July. The group hit enemy positions to cover the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September 1944. Struck front-line positions, communications, and airfields to help stop the German counteroffensive in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945. Flew missions in support of Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. In 1944 Polebrook also became the headquarters of the 94th Combat Wing, which controlled the 351st, the 457th Bomb Group at RAF Glatton and the 401st Bomb Group at RAF Deenethorpe. The 351st conducted routine 8th Air Force missions from RAF Polebrook until the end of the war. The unit completed 311 combat missions from Polebrook. The 351st lost 175 B-173s and their crews. The gunners in the Group fired off 2,776,028 rounds of ammunition and were credited with destroying 303 enemy aircraft. The 509th Bomb Squadron completed 54 consecutive missions without losses between June 1943 to January 1944. The unit returned to the US soon after V-E Day with the air element leaving 21 May and the ground echelon sailing 25 June. Reassigned to Sioux Falls AAF, South Dakota during August 1945. The 391st Bomb Group was inactivated on 28 August 1945. RAF Polebrook was subsequently returned to the RAF on 28 August 1945, and the base was placed on care and maintenance status. =Medal of Honor= Two members of the 351st, Lt. Walter E. Truemper and S/Sgt. Archibald Mathies, were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. On a mission to Leipzig, Germany, 20 February 1944 their B-17 Ten Horsepower was attacked by German fighters. The co-pilot was killed and pilot Lt. Clarence Nelson was badly wounded. Truemper and Mathies flew the badly damaged B-17 back to England where the remainder of the crew bailed out, then attempted to land the plane to save the life of the unconscious pilot. On their third attempt Ten Horsepower crashed on final approach and all three airmen were killed. Legacy During the Cold War, the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command 351st Strategic Missile Wing stood alert with Minuteman I and later, Minuteman II ICBMs starting in 1963 at Whiteman AFB Missouri. The wing was bestowed the lineage, honours and history of the World War II USAAF 351st Bomb Wing upon activation. The 351st SMW won the SAC missile combat competitions and Blanchard Trophy in 1967, 1971, and 1977. Named as SAC's \\"best Minuteman wing\\" in 1972, it stood down from alert and was inactivated in 1995. Hollywood at Polebrook Lt. James M. Stewart & Lt. Clark Gable, 1943 During much of 1943, Captain Clark Gable was stationed at Polebrook to produce a recruiting film for aircraft gunners. He had trained with the 351st Bomb Group at Biggs Army Air Base, Texas, and Pueblo Army Air Base, Colorado, then accompanied it overseas in early April 1943. Much of the film was shot by former MGM cinematographer First Lieutenant Andrew McIntyre, whom MGM had arranged to enter duty with and accompany Gable in training, and scripting was by John Lee Mahin, a Hollywood screenwriter also in the unit. While with the 351st Gable flew five combat missions as an observer. 1) Gable's first combat mission occurred on 4 May 1943, when Gable accompanied 351st group commander Lt. Col. William A. Hatcher on a late afternoon familiarization mission before the 351st became operational. Flying squadron lead with Capt William R. Calhoun of the 303rd Bomb Group, RAF Molesworth, against the Ford and General Motors plants at Antwerp, Belgium, Hatcher and Gable's B-17 was nicknamed The 8 Ball MK II (s/n 41-24635). Gable fired a few rounds from a machine gun mounted in the radio room and suffered a minor case of frostbite from wearing leather gloves in the extreme cold. 2) Gable's second mission came 10 July 1943, flying with Second Lt. Theodore Argiropulos of the 351st's 508th Bomb Squadron in Argonaut III (42-29851) to bomb the airfield at Villacoublay, France. The mission was frustrating in that clouds forced the bombers to return without dropping their ordnance, but did not prevent German fighter attacks. 3) His third combat mission occurred on 24 July 1943, again in Argonaut III as the lead aircraft of the 351st, with group executive officer Lt.Col. Robert W. Burns. The mission to bomb the Norsk Hydro chemical plants in Her√∏ya, Norway, was unopposed, but was also the longest by the Eighth Air Force to that date and began a week-long series of intensive operations against German targets known as the \\"Blitz Week\\". 4) On the morning of 12 August 1943, his fourth mission was to bomb a synthetic oil plant at Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr, joining 351st operations officer Maj. Theodore \\"Ross\\" Milton and Capt. John B. Carraway's crew in Ain't It Gruesome (42-29863). Bombing Bochum, Germany, as a target of opportunity in bad weather, Gable experienced the Eighth's most dangerous mission to date, with 25 of its 330 B-17s shot down. Although none of the 351st's Fortresses went down, 11 suffered battle damage, one crash- landed on return, and the group's crews suffered one killed and seven wounded. During the mission, Gable wedged himself behind the top turret gunner for a better view as German fighters made five passes at the 351st's formation. A 20mm shell came up through Aint It Gruesome's flight deck, cut off the heel from Gable's boot, and exited one foot from his head, all without exploding. Afterward, the crew noticed the fifteen holes in the aircraft, and Gable noticed his boot. Brushing off concern with reporters, Gable claimed, \\"I didn't know it had happened. I didn't know anything about it until we had dropped eleven thousand feet, and could get off oxygen and look around. Only then did I see the hole in the turret.\\" 5) Gable's final combat mission was an early morning strike to the port area of Nantes, France, on 23 September 1943. He flew with Lt. Col. Burns and 510th Bomb Squadron commander Maj. John Blaylock, leading the 351st in The Dutchess (42-29925). Half of the six groups assigned failed to assemble in bad weather, and intercepting fighters inflicted extensive battle damage to the other half, but no bombers were lost. Gable left his film crew in the waist of the bomber and manned a gun in the nose. Captain Clark Gable was awarded the Air Medal on 4 October for completing five combat missions, and later the Distinguished Flying Cross. His final three missions were flown in the dangerous position of group lead, a hazard emphasized when the B-17 flown by Col. Hatcher and Major Blaylock was shot down near Cognac, France, on 31 December 1943, killing Blaylock and resulting in Hatcher's capture. Gable left the 351st on 5 November 1943, returning to the US with over 50,000 feet of 16mm colour film. In 1944, the film Combat America, narrated by Gable, was shown in theatres. =Back to Royal Air Force control= Post-war the station came under No. 273 Maintenance Unit RAF and the airfield was kept in usable state until October 1948 when it was closed. RAF Polebrook was kept in caretaker status until 1959. The Thor missile deployment was an emergency response by the US to what was perceived as a missile gap with the Soviet Union. Launch orders for Thor missiles were to be given jointly by UK-US officers from HQ Bomber Command, High Wycombe and USAF 7th Air Division, co-located at the same base. An RAF officer could order a missile to be launched, but a USAF officer had to authenticate arming the warhead. The W49 thermonuclear warhead fitted to a Thor missile had a destructive yield of 1.44 megatons, and weighed 1680 lbs. The missile itself had a CEP of approximately two miles. No. 130(SM) Squadron (North Luffenham Wing) was formed at what was retained for RAF use at Polebrook to operate three Thor missile emplacements which were constructed in the centre of the former airfield area. The Thor missiles were operational until August 1963, when the rockets were removed and the unit disbanded. Current use 351st Bomb Group Memorial With the end of military control, the remnants of RAF Polebrook were sold back to the Rothschild estate in 1967 and the St Ives Sand and Gravel company broke up all concrete apart from the ends of runways 02 and 32 during the next decade. Today, Polebrook airfield has few reminders of its wartime past and is almost unidentifiable from the air. All of the wartime concreted areas have been removed with the exception of the deteriorating Thor missile launch pads from the early 1960s. A memorial was erected in early 1981 and some old buildings remain scattered around in the area being used for agricultural purposes. The large J-Type hangar still exists and the owners are very American friendly and very respectful of the hangar's place in history.

He was incarcerated for murdering his father and stepmother in 1981. Prior to committing his crime, he served four years in the United States Navy. He was married to Teresa \\"Terri\\" Hunter, but divorced in 1989. Originally given a sentence of death in May 1984, his sentence has since been commuted to life without the possibility of parole after a retrial in February 2002. Crime and trial On the evening of December 28, 1981, Jay and Ruth Hunter, Michael's father and stepmother, were shot to death in the bedroom of their home in Pacifica, California. The events surrounding their death, as revealed through the evidence and testimony at trial, were as follows. In November 1981, about a month before the homicides, Hunter told his friend, Thomas Henkemeyer, of plans to kill his father and stepmother. According to Henkemeyer, Hunter laid out several scenarios for possible alibis, including taking out a hiking permit in Yosemite National Park and then returning to commit the murders, or going down to San Diego where friends would purportedly provide an alibi. Based on earlier conversations with Hunter, Henkemeyer concluded that Hunter's motive for the planned killings was to take \\"revenge\\" for a number of perceived grievances, including an incident in which his stepmother had reported Hunter for breaking into his parents' home while they were away on vacation, and his stepmother's handling of his natural mother's will, which Hunter believed resulted in his being cheated out of his inheritance. Hunter also discussed possible methods of transporting and concealing a rifle or shotgun. About a month later, on the evening of December 28, a neighbor of Jay and Ruth Hunter was awakened by a loud \\"bang or shot\\" from the direction of the Hunter residence. He heard four more shots in quick succession. On or about the same evening in late December, Philip Eldred was walking two dogs a short distance from the Hunter residence when he encountered a man wearing a leather jacket and a motorcycle helmet. For no apparent reason the man told Eldred to leave the area. Eldred refused. In response, the man pointed a long object (which Eldred then realized was a shotgun) at Eldred's face, kicked him in the thigh and retreated behind a cyclone fence several feet away. He then fired a shotgun blast in Eldred's direction, entered a small, burgundy-colored car parked nearby, and drove away. Eldred stated that the man appeared to be in his early 20s and of medium build. Hunter was 23 at the time of the offenses. The bodies of Jay and Ruth Hunter were discovered the following day, December 29, 1981, after the police were alerted that the front door of the residence was wide open and a window on the side of the door was broken out. The police found both bodies in the master bedroom. The body of Jay Hunter was on the bed; that of Ruth Hunter was lying against the far wall, on top of the telephone receiver. Eight expended shotgun casings were found on the floor. Autopsies revealed that Ruth Hunter had died of two shotgun wounds to the head, either of which was sufficient to cause death. Jay Hunter had suffered four shotgun wounds. One shot to the upper chest that had apparently caused death was fired from a distance. Three other shots, to the neck, abdomen and left knee, had been fired from much closer range and were consistent with having been inflicted where the victim lay. During the next several days, Henkemeyer, still in Minnesota visiting his family, received two telephone calls from Hunter. In the first call, Hunter told Henkemeyer that he had killed his mother and father and was trying to decide what to do. During the second call, a day or two later, Hunter said that he had spoken with a lawyer, was preparing to leave the country, and asked him to sell some of his belongings. He also indicated that he had been seen by a stranger after the killings but doubted that an identification could be made because he was wearing a helmet. When Henkemeyer returned home to Sacramento on New Year's Day, he found that the shotgun Hunter had left was missing. On the way to the San Jose Airport, Hunter stopped at a barbershop and had his beard and moustache shaved off. Hunter asked another friend (Jefferson Schar) to obtain a phony birth certificate for him under the name John Dunne. After obtaining a ticket to San Diego under a false name, Hunter told Schar that he planned to contact a friend named Jeffrey Luther in San Diego and instructed Schar to forward the phony birth certificate to him there. Luther received a telephone call from Hunter on January 3, 1982. The two arranged to meet at a restaurant in San Ysidro, near the U.S.-Mexican border. At the restaurant, Hunter told Luther that he was \\"wanted for murder\\" and explained the circumstances of the shootings. Hunter told him that he had confronted his father and threatened to shoot him. His father responded, \\"You don't have the balls.\\" In response, Hunter told Luther, he \\"pumped four slugs into him.\\" Following the conversation in San Ysidro, Luther saw Hunter again in a hotel in the Mexican town of Las Playas. Luther agreed to purchase some items for him. After the meeting in Mexico, however, Luther contacted the police, who advised him not to meet Hunter again in Mexico but rather to lure him back across the border. Accordingly, Luther arranged to meet Hunter again at the restaurant in San Ysidro where they had met earlier. When Hunter appeared at the restaurant, he was arrested. Following his arrest, Hunter was incarcerated in the San Mateo County jail. Joseph Lauricella, Hunter's cellmate, testified that Hunter gave him a number of descriptions of how the murders occurred. Hunter also told him that he had been turned in by a Navy buddy (Luther) and offered Lauricella $1,000 to have him killed. Even as Hunter was fleeing to Mexico, the police investigation into the killings was focusing on him as the prime suspect. A search of Hunter's house and two vehicles uncovered a cleaning bill for a leather jacket which stated \\"pre-spot for blood.\\" The police also found a shirt with blood on it and a black motorcycle helmet. Glass fragments found inside a pair of Hunter's socks and gloves matched glass fragments from the broken window of the Hunter residence. Finally, a number of prosecution witnesses testified about Hunter's troubled relationship with his father and stepmother. Hunter's father and natural mother, June Hunter, had separated and divorced in 1973. June Hunter died of cancer in 1979. Following the divorce, Jay Hunter married Ruth Chatburn Hunter. Hunter's sister, who was the administrator of her mother's estate, asked Ruth, a lawyer, to handle the probate. Ruth eventually removed herself from the case, however, because of an argument with Hunter sometime in 1980. Hunter felt that he had been cheated of his share of the estate. According to a former roommate of Hunter, the dispute became so acrimonious that it caused a rupture of all contacts between Hunter and his father. The acrimony was apparently mutual. Only a month before the murders, in late November 1981, Hunter's father instructed his attorney to delete from his will any inheritance for Michael. Mr. Hunter indicated that the matter was not urgent, however, and could wait until the new year. At the time of the murders in late December, the will had not been changed.

E. Petersen, F. J. Sansom and L. M. Warshawsky of Systems Engineering Group within the Air Force Materiel Command at the Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, United States.Defense Technical Information Center It is an expression-oriented continuous block simulation language, but capable of incorporating blocks of FORTRAN-like algebra. MIMIC is a further development from MIDAS (Modified Integration Digital Analog Simulator), which represented analog computer design. Written completely in FORTRAN but one routine in COMPASS, and ran on Control Data supercomputers, MIMIC is capable of solving much larger simulation models. With MIMIC, ordinary differential equations describing mathematical models in several scientific disciplines as in engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, economics and as well as in social sciences can easily be solved by numerical integration and the results of the analysis are listed or drawn in diagrams. It also enables the analysis of nonlinear dynamic conditions. The MIMIC software package, written as FORTRAN overlay programs, executes input statements of the mathematical model in six consecutive passes. Simulation programs written in MIMIC are compiled rather than interpreted. The core of the simulation package is a variable step numerical integrator of fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Many useful functions related to electrical circuit elements exist besides some mathematical functions found in most scientific programming languages. There is no need to sort the statements in order of dependencies of the variables, since MIMIC does it internally. Parts of the software organized in overlays are: *MIMIN (input)‚Äì reads in user simulation program and data, *MIMCO (compiler) ‚Äì compiles the user program and creates an in-core array of instructions, *MIMSO (sort)‚Äì sorts the instructions array after dependencies of variables, *MIMAS (assembler) ‚Äì converts the BCD instructions into machine-oriented code, *MIMEX (execute)‚Äì executes the user program by integrating, *MIMOUT (output)‚Äì puts out the data as a list or diagram of data.

Pap published a number of books regarding analytical philosophy, its function within philosophy, and its impact on society. Life and works Pap was born October 1, 1921 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland in a Jewish family. His musical talent was revealed early and his passion for playing the piano remained through all of his life.The Limits of Logical Empirism; Selected papers of Arthur Pap (2006), eds. Keupnik A. and Shieh S., Springer: Synthese Library, Vol. 334, includes A brief Intellectual Biography by Shieh S., pp. 365-368, and Biographical Notes by Pauline Pap, pp. 369-374 In high school Pap developed also a passion for philosophy and enrolled at Z√ºrich University, where took courses in philosophy and logic from Karl D√ºrr. At the start of World War II the family fled to the United States and, in 1941, settled in New York City. Pap entered the Juilliard School of Music where he spent a term before starting his studies at Columbia in the fall of 1941. After obtaining his BA at Columbia, Pap went to Yale University in 1943 for his master's degree. Ernst Cassirer, who was guest professor at Yale from 1941 to 1944, became his supervisor and provided the original stimulus for Pap‚Äôs work on hypothetical necessity and the functional a priori. In 1944 Pap went back to Columbia where he completed his PhD thesis under the supervision of Ernest Nagel, who first rejected the manuscript. However, it won the Woodbridge Prize for best philosophical dissertation and was subsequently published as The A Priori in Physical Theory (1946). Pap started teaching at various universities and had the opportunity to meet some leading philosophers, notably Rudolf Carnap, with whom he developed a lasting friendship. During the first years of his career Pap worked on what is now perhaps his best-known book, Elements of Analytic Philosophy.Ibid., p. 366 Taking a break, next he published a translation of Viktor Kraft's Der Wiener Kreis.Kraft V., Der Wiener Kreis. Der Ursprung des Neopositivismus, Wien: Springer Verlag (1950), translation as The Vienna Circle: The Origins of Neo- Positivism, New York: Philosophical Library, 1953 Kraft recommended him to be a Fulbright lecturer at Vienna University for the academic year 1953-54. Paul Feyerabend became his assistant there and helped in the publication of the lectures. Returning from Europe, Pap stayed briefly at Lehigh University, then took succession from Carl Hempel as analytic philosopher of science at Yale. There he read courses and held seminars on logic, probability and induction, the philosophy of Russell, and the history of analytic philosophy. In 1957, he edited in collaboration with Paul Edwards the well-known textbook A Modern Introduction to Philosophy.A Modern Introduction to Philosophy: Readings from classical and contemporary sources, Paul Edwards and Arthur Pap (eds); New York: Free Press (1957) In the summer of 1959, Pap completed a book, An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science, which appeared posthumously.

It is a rare example of a stone castle built by a Gaelic Irish chief, although its origins and history are uncertain. It is associated with Henry Aimhr√©idh O'Neill (died 1392), anglicised as Harry Avery, and is certainly named after him. It is in the townland of Upper or New Deer Park, in the Derry and Strabane District Council area, at . The remains of the castle are a State Care Monument under the guardianship of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. Description The ruins of the castle stand on a low hill, the top of which has been artificially steepened to form a mound. This mound was ringed by a curtain wall, most of which does not survive. The standing part of the castle comprises a two-storey rectangular construction fronted by massive D-shaped twin towers. Although having the appearance of a gatehouse, this structure was in fact a simple tower house with the D-towers added to the front. The tower comprised a vaulted basement entered from a large door between the D-towers. Above this was a hall on the first floor level, which was accessed from the courtyard. The southerly D-tower contained a spiral stair linking the two storeys, and both D-towers contained small rooms at first floor, with single windows in their round walls. Traces of a mural stair lead up from the first floor, and there is a latrine chute leading up, suggesting at least a parapet at the second floor. Examination of the structure suggests that it was built in a single phase, rather than being a modification of an older gatehouse. The design of the castle has been compared to that of Elagh Castle, Inishowen, which also appears to have been a native-built castle featuring D-towers. The inspiration is thought have come from Norman castles such as Carrickfergus Castle and Castle Roche, both of which have true gatehouses flanked by D-towers. The overall design of Harry Avery's Castle is also similar to other Gaelic fortresses such as Seafin, County Down, which were later enclosed by a curtain wall with a tower house. The Annals of the Four Masters record the death of Harry Avery, \\"Enr√≠ Aimhreidh mac Neill M√≥ir U√≠ N√©ill\\", on the feast day of St Brendan, 1392, and praise his justice, nobility, and hospitality. However, there appears to be no historical record of this site, suggesting it was a location of limited importance.

As GNEP the proposal proved controversial in the United States and internationally. The U.S. Congress provided far less funding for GNEP than President George W. Bush requested. U.S. arms control organizations criticized the proposal to resume reprocessing as costly and increasing proliferation risks. Some countries and analysts criticized the GNEP proposal for discriminating between countries as nuclear fuel cycle \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots.\\" In April 2009 the U.S. Department of Energy announced the cancellation of the U.S. domestic component of GNEP. In 2010, the GNEP was renamed the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation. IFNEC is now an international partnership with 25 partner countries, 28 observer and candidate partner countries, and three international organization observers.International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation The international organization observers are: the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Generation IV International Forum, and the European Commission. IFNEC operates by consensus among its partners based on an agreed GNEP Statement of Mission. GNEP in the United States The GNEP proposal began as part of the Advanced Energy Initiative announced by President Bush in his 2006 State of the Union address.State of the Union: The Advanced Energy Initiative In announcing the GNEP Proposal, the U.S. Department of Energy said: As a research and development program, GNEP is an outgrowth of the Advanced Fuel Cycle InitiativeAdvanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. What is the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership? In April 2009 the U.S. Department of Energy announced the cancellation of the U.S. domestic component of GNEP, and in June 2009 announced that it is no longer pursuing domestic commercial reprocessing and had largely halted the domestic GNEP programme. Research would continue on proliferation-resistant fuel cycles and waste management. Partnerships The United States has established a number of cooperative arrangements to pursue technical cooperation on this proposal. On February 16, 2006 the United States, France and Japan signed an \\"arrangement\\" to research and develop sodium-cooled fast reactors in support of the GNEP. The United States has established \\"action plans\\" for collaboration with Russia, Japan and China.International Collaboration On September 16, 2007, 16 countries officially became GNEP Partners by signing the GNEP Statement of Principles. These countries were: *Australia *Bulgaria *China *France *Ghana *Hungary *Japan *Jordan *Kazakhstan *Lithuania *Poland *Romania *Russia *Slovenia *Ukraine *United States Since then, nine additional countries have joined: *Armenia *Canada *Estonia *Italy *Republic of Korea *Morocco *Oman *Senegal *United Kingdom Seventeen countries have been invited to join GNEP as partners but have not been willing to sign the Statement of Principles and have participated as observers. These include South Africa, although South African Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica stated that \\"Exporting uranium only to get it back refined, instead of enriching it in South Africa, would be 'in conflict with our national policy.'\\" 25 additional countries have been invited to join GNEP at the October 1, 2008 GNEP Ministerial in Paris, France.Global Nuclear Energy Partnership website Criticism In 2007 a large number of U.S. nuclear arms control organizations sent a joint letter to Congress requesting that GNEP funding be terminated on the grounds that it undermined U.S. nuclear proliferation policy, would cost over $100 billion, and did not solve the nuclear waste problem. In 2008 Congress allocated less than half of the requested funds, supporting GNEP research but not technology demonstration projects. The Congressional Budget Office assessed that reprocessing spent nuclear fuel would cost considerably more than disposal in a long-term repository. Some states do not approve of the GNEP philosophy that partitions the world between a few fuel-cycle states and a larger number of receiver states, reflecting the distinctions in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. They are concerned that their nuclear fuel assurance could in the future be subject to external political pressure. They also believe it creates an unfortunate incentive on states to develop enrichment or reprocessing technology now, to position themselves to become one of the future fuel-cycle states. Steve Kidd, Head of Strategy & Research at the World Nuclear Association, has explained: > An alternative view of GNEP may see it as somewhat discriminatory and > potentially anti-competitive. By restricting parts of the fuel cycle to > particular countries, albeit with fair rights of access to nuclear > materials, there is a risk of maintaining or even reinforcing the existing > NPT arrangements that have always upset certain nations, notably India and > Pakistan. Similarly, by maintaining a market stranglehold on, for example, > enrichment facilities in the existing countries, it can be argued that the > market will be uncompetitive and lead to excessive profits being achieved by > those who are so favoured. Another criticism is that GNEP seeks to deploy proliferation-prone reprocessing technology for commercial reasons, and to bypass the continued delays with the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, while erroneously claiming to enhance global nuclear security.

History People already settled in this area about 2,000 years ago. The village developed around the parish church of St. Peter which was built in the 9th/10th century. It is known that in 1432 Waltrop was a part of the county Dortmund. After the Soest Feud, the archbishops of Cologne could intervene against the counts of Mark, so that Waltrop became a part of Vest Recklinghausen. The production of coal in the mine started in 1905. As a consequence, Waltrop grew larger and became an industrial town. The coal mine was closed down in 1974. In 1939, Waltrop got its municipal rights.

He died during an attempt to climb the Eiger north face with his partner Andreas Hinterstoisser. Biography Toni Kurz was born on 13 January 1913 in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany, where he was raised. He completed a brief apprenticeship as a pipefitter before joining the German Wehrmacht in 1934 as a professional soldier. Together with his childhood friend Andreas Hinterstoisser, he made numerous first ascents of peaks in the Berchtesgaden Alps, including some of the most difficult climbs of that time. The two young men climbed the southwest wall of the Berchtesgadener Hochthron in 1934, and the south wall of the straight pillar in 1936. They also made first ascents in the Reiter Alpe on the German‚ÄìAustrian border, and of the direct southern route up the Watzmannkinder in the Watzmann in 1935.Auffermann 2010, p. 91. In July 1936, Kurz and Hinterstoisser left Berchtesgaden, where they were serving in the military, and travelled by bicycle to Kleine Scheidegg, Switzerland to attempt to climb the Eiger north face. While on the mountain, they met up with two Austrian climbers‚ÄîEdi Rainer and Willy Angerer‚Äîand the four decided to continue their attempt together.Harrer 1998, pp. 31‚Äì32. During the ascent, Angerer was injured by falling rocks loosened by the warmth of the rising sun as they crossed the first ice field. As a result of Angerer's worsening condition and their slow progress across the second ice field, they abandoned the attempt on the Eiger and decided to descend. A further challenge arose when Kurz and his comrades failed to retrace their route across the area now known as the Hinterstoisser Traverse and had to climb downwards. As the result of another avalanche, Hinterstoisser himself became disconnected, plummeted down the mountain, and perished. Later, Willy Angerer, now climbing below Kurz, was smashed against the wall, dying instantly. Edi Rainer, the climber who had been securing the other two, was pulled against the wall and died minutes later of asphyxiation. Kurz, alone now, remained uninjured. Later that day, amid worsening weather, a rescue team attempted to reach Kurz from below, ascending by means of the railway tunnel that ran through the mountain, the Jungfraubahn. They could not reach Kurz due to the severity of the storm and were forced to leave him dangling unprotected and exposed to the elements for the entire night. The next day, the team again attempted to effect a rescue; Kurz himself made the effort, despite a frozen hand due to losing a glove, to abseil down the face of the mountain and reach the team. To accomplish this, he first had to cut loose the dead body of his comrade hanging below him, then climb up and cut loose his other dead comrade. To increase the length of his rope, he unravelled it and tied it together again. This entire process took five gruelling hours. He then lowered the rope to the waiting rescuers, who attached their own rope. Kurz' grave in Berchtesgaden, Germany The mountain guides only had one long rope ‚Äì 60 metres ‚Äì with them. Hans Schlunegger just put it between his back and his rucksack (not into his rucksack) to save some time. This was not an unusual practice for them. Unfortunately when he made a sudden movement the rope dropped and fell down to the foot of the wall. As a result the team combined two shorter ropes to reach the required length; however the combined ropes still fell short. Kurz pulled up their rope, fixed it, and began his abseiling descent. He was stopped a mere couple of metres above his rescuers by the knot. To abseil any further he would have had to raise himself enough to release the tension on the knot and let it pass through his gear. Desperately, Kurz tried to move himself past the knot, but in vain. Facing the futility of his situation, he said only \\"Ich kann nicht mehr\\" (\\"I can't [go on] anymore\\") and died. His body was later recovered by a German team. Legacy The tragic story became well known after publication of Heinrich Harrer's classic 1960 book The White Spider and was more recently covered by Joe Simpson's book (and Emmy-winning TV documentary), The Beckoning Silence, as well as the 2008 German dramatic movie North Face.

He was the lead singer for the seminal hardcore punk band Big Boys, formed in Austin in the late 1970s. Turner is regarded as a pioneer gay performer in the world of punk rock. Biography =Early years= Randy J. \\"Biscuit\\" Turner was born November 25, 1949, in Gladewater, Texas, United States. =Musical career= Turner's band, Big Boys, along with The Dicks, Really Red, and MDC, are credited with the development of hardcore punk in Texas, while it was simultaneously emerging in other cities as well. They were one of the earliest skate punk groups, were featured in Thrasher skateboarding magazine and videos, and had their own Big Boys skateboard. The group also is known for being the first punk band to introduce funk rhythms into hardcore, influencing later bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers. Turner was noted for outrageous stage antics, such as wearing a pink ballerina's tutu and pink cowboy boots while performing.Al Kowalewski and Holly Duval Cornell, \\"Big Boys,\\" Flipside, whole no 32 (August 1982), pg. 12. Queried about his sexuality by Flipside magazine in 1982, \\"Biscuit\\" Turner replied: > \\"I don't know if I want to answer that or not because it doesn't make any > difference if I'm gay or not, I'm a human being and my sexual preference > doesn't play into my lifestyle. It comes from my heart and I want people to > look at me and say I'm a human being ‚Äî don't ask me about what 5% of my life > is.\\" In his musical career, Turner also played with Cargo Cult, Texas Biscuit Bombs, Naugahyde Dream Sequence, and Swine King, the last of which contributed a song to Outpunk Records' seminal queercore compilation CD Outpunk Dance Party. =Other pursuits= Turner also took many turns in the theatre and performance realm. He was well known as a spoken word poet and was welcomed at many readings in Austin's busy slam poetry scene. He took several turns as the \\"penalty diva\\" for TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls around 2003, after the death of his friend Amberdiva who had held that position. He performed in 1992 in an award winning production of \\"Our Town\\" at Zachary Scott Theatre, playing both the professor and the reverend. Biscuit was an avid collector, garage sale maniac, and found object artist. His house was a treasure trove of Americana and he decorated the outside with all sorts of sculptural creations and lights during the holidays. Neighbors and kids often stopped to gawk at his amazing creations and \\"finds\\" that surrounded his South Austin home. =Death and legacy= Turner was found dead in his home in south Austin on August 19, 2005. The cause of death was reported to be cirrhosis of the liver due to a chronic, untreated hepatitis C infection. He was preparing for a show of his artwork scheduled to open just a few days after he died. He was featured on the cover of the local independent newspaper, The Austin Chronicle, which was released the day after his death. In 2004, in a song called \\"Ode\\", from the CD Complete Discography, the queercore band Limp Wrist pay homage to Randy Turner, along with Gary Floyd of The Dicks and Joshua Plague of Mukilteo Fairies and Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live, for being pioneering gay punks in the hardcore scene who have paved the way for Limp Wrist.

History In 1989 the Howard Hughes Medical Institute provided funding to establish a central repository for human genetic mapping data. This project ultimately resulted in the creation of the GDB Human Genome DataBase in September 1990. It was a key database in the Human Genome Project. In order to ensure a high degree of quality, records within GDB were subjected to a curation process by human genetics specialists, including the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. Established under the leadership of Peter Pearson and Dick Lucier, GDB received financial support from the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health. Located at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, GDB became a source of high quality mapping data which were made available both online as well as through numerous printed publications. The project was supported internationally by the EU, Japan, and other countries. The GDB had several directors in its time. Peter Pearson, David T. Kingsbury, Stantley Letovsky, Peter Li, and A. Jamie Cuticchia. In 1998, the change of focus in the human genome project redirected US Department of Energy funds which were previously available for GDB. However that same year, A. Jamie Cuticchia obtained funding from Canadian public and private sources to continue the operations of GDB. While the data curation continued to be performed at Johns Hopkins, GDB central operations were moved to The Hospital for Sick Children (HSC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In November 2001, the HSC fired Cuticchia due to a dispute over the GDB website domain name. In 2003 RTI International became the new host for GDB where it continued to be maintained as a public resource; GDB was closed in 2008 after control of the project reverted to Johns Hopkins.

Vaidyanatha Iyer (28 August 1896 ‚Äì 16 October 1974) was a Carnatic music singer from Palakkad (state of Kerala, India). Known by his village name Chembai, or simply as Bhagavatar, he was born to Anantha Bhagavatar and Parvati Ammal in 1896, into a Tamil Brahmin family at Kottayi-I/II near Palakkad on Janmashtami day.L. R. Viswanatha Sarma (1954), Chembai Selvam (Biography of Chembai), 1954: Amudha Nilayam Ltd. Chembai was noted for his powerful voice and majestic styleN. Pattabhi Raman and K.S. Krishnamurthi, Sruti, Issue 98, November 1992 of singing. His first public performance was in 1904, when he was nine. A recipient of several titles and honours (including the Madras Music Academy's Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1951), he was known for his encouragement of upcoming musicians and ability to spot new talent. He was responsible for popularising compositions like Rakshamam Saranagatam and Pavana Guru, among others. The music critic 'Aeolus' described him as \\"the musician who has meant the most to Carnatic Music in the first fifty years of the 20th century.\\"Aeolus, Shankar's Weekly, 12 December 1963 His prominent disciples include Chembai Narayana Bhagavathar, Mangu Thampuran, Guruvayur Ponnammal, T. V. Gopalakrishnan, V. V. Subramaniam, P. Leela, K. G. Jayan, K. G. Vijayan, K. J. Yesudas, Kudumaru Venkataraman and Babu Parameswaran, among others. He also mentored many young accompanists, including Palghat Mani Iyer, Lalgudi Jayaraman, M. S. Gopalakrishnan, T. N. Krishnan, Palani Subramaniam Pillai and L. Subramaniam. Memorial music festivals have been held in his honour annually since his death in 1974, the most important being the annually celebrated Chembai Sangeetholsavam. Early life 290px The family's connection with classical music spans five centuries. Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar's father, Anantha Bhagavatar, was a violinist and singer from Chembai, near Palakkad, to whom a local Maharaja awarded the title \\"Ghana Chakratanam\\", indicating his mastery of a special closed-mouth style of singing tanam. At age 3, Chembai began to learn Carnatic music from his father in the customary guru-sishya tradition, and also began violin and flute training in 1912. Chembai is also one of 12 names of Sirkazhi, the birthplace of saint Gnanasambandar 7th century CE in TN. Singing career Some of the noteworthy early events that helped shape Chembai's career include his arangetram (debut concert) in Ottapalam in 1904, performances at Vaikom and Guruvayur in 1907, his year with Kaliakudi Natesa Sastry (1909) and the accolades he received from Palghat Anantharama Bhagavatar (1911). Between 1913 and 1927, he performed at many different music festivals and sabhas, notably including the Madras Music Academy and the often forgotten Jagannatha Bhakta Sabha. =Release of recordings= Chembai has many phonograph recordings to his credit, recorded from 1932 to 1946. Those were the days before the advent of the concert microphone, and a singer was entirely dependent on the timbre and reach of his voice for a successful concert. Chembai was blessed with a voice of great depth. Further, the perception that Chembai's repertoire of songs was limited is highly incorrect. The number of different compositions he recorded is in the hundreds (let alone the total number he performed in concerts and on radio during his career).Chembai - Recordings =Lalita Dasar Kritis (1945)= Chembai's old friend, T. G. Krishna Iyer, from Tripunithura, had settled in Madras (now Chennai) and offered a house to Chembai on Palace Road near Santhome. He had composed some 155 kritis in Malayalam, Tamil and Sanskrit under the mudra 'Lalita dasar' and requested Chembai to popularise them. Chembai set the kritis to classical music and got them published under the name Lalita Dasar Keertanaigal. He made it a practice to sing these kritis in most of his concerts. He also released a record containing selected kritis from Lalita Dasar's kritis like Evariki Telusunamma (Dhanyasi), Ennil Kaninda (Shankarabharanam), Pavana Guru (Hamsanandi), Varijadala Lochani (Arabhi), among others. =Performing ability and style= Chembai had a vigorous, strong, vibrant, ringing and resonant voice. He would sing in a clear, open- throated style that requires high levels of physical and mental endurance to pull off, yet, he did so in a seemingly effortless manner. He had a wonderful sense of accurate kala pramana (time measure). He could do a niraval and swaraprastara from any given point, which bespoke of mental alertness in a concert. His empathy for his accompanists and disciples was noteworthy and he would go to great lengths to encourage them. Other stalwarts have admired the strengths in Chembai's singing. For instance, upon witnessing that Chembai was able to sing three major concerts in a single day, Sangeetha Kalanidhi G. N. Balasubramaniam is said to have remarked \\"These are not ordinary men. These are the Asuras of the music field. If I sing one concert, I need to rest the whole of next day\\". Legendary percussionist Pudukkottai Dakshinamurthy Pillai would call him \\"Laya Brahma\\" for his impeccable grasp of tala and laya. Sangeetha Kalanidhi K. V. Narayanaswamy has also remarked on Chembai's ability to hold notes aligned perfectly to sruti for extended intervals of time. =Disciples= Chembai had many students, including K. J. Yesudas and many noted musicians like Sangeetha Kalanidhi T. V. Gopalakrishnan, P. Leela, and the Jaya-Vijaya twins, Kudumaru Venkataraman and others. Death Chembai died suddenly on 16 October 1974, aged 78, of a cardiac arrest. Shortly before that, he performed his last concert at Poozhikkunnu Sreekrishna temple in Ottapalam (the venue of his first concert), and concluded the concert with his favourite song \\"Karuna Cheivan Endu Thamasam Krishna\\" (Why is there so much delay in conferring your mercy, Krishna?). He was talking to his disciple Olappamanna Vasudevan Namboothiripad when he suddenly collapsed and died. His nephew said he had always spoken about an easy death, and had attained it.Bhakthapriya magazine, 2004 He was cremated in his birth village. He was survived by his wife and daughter, both of them who died later. The Govt. Musical College in Palakkad was renamed as 'Chembai Memorial Govt' Musical College' in his memory. Awards and titles Chembai on a 1996 stamp of India Chembai received several awards and titles during his career, most notably including: * \\"Gayana Gandharva\\" (a title bestowed by Kalki Krishnamurthy in 1940) * Sangeetha Kalanidhi (1951; highest accolade in Carnatic music) * Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1958) * Sangeetha Kalasikhamani (1964; by The Fine Arts Society, Chennai) * Padma Bhushan (1973) ‚Äì The Padma Bhushan is a national award bestowed by the President of India on select musicians and other eminent people. Chembai was selected to receive the award in 1973 from the then president V. V. Giri. * The Department of Posts, Govt of India released a special issue stamp in Chembai's birth centenary year (1996). Music festivals Chembai had been conducting a music festival in his native village from 1924 onwards. This was continued by his family and now by Chembai Sreenivasan and Chembai Suresh (C. A. Subramanian). The concert, called Chembai Ekadasi Music Festival, is held annually in February‚ÄìMarch. Chembai also held a music festival on Guruvayur Ekadasi Day (mid-November) at Guruvayur every year. This festival, now called Chembai Sangeetholsavam in his honour, is officially conducted by the Guruvayur Devaswom Board. Guruvayurappan Chembai Puraskaram The Sri Guvayurappan Chembai Puraskaram, awarded by Sree Krishna Temple, Guruvayur, is instituted in Chembai's memory of the late Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar.

History and profile El Fagr was first published on 3 June 2005. The paper is part of Al-Fagr for Printing and Publishing Inc. The weekly, published on Thursdays, is a sensationalist publication. Hassan Amr is one of the former editors of the paper. As of 2013 Manal Lashin was the editor-in-chief of the weekly. In its 21st edition, dated 17 October 2005, El Fagr was the first newspaper worldwide to republish on its front page (one cartoon) and page 17, a total of six cartoons portraying the Islamic prophet Muhammad of twelve cartoons originally published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. These twelve cartoons gave rise to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. However, these caricatures received little attention in Egypt and the paper was not banned due to its reprints of the caricatures. In March 2006 Amira Malsh, a journalist working for El Fagr, was sentenced to a year in prison with hard labor because of libeling a judge in an article published in the paper. In 2013 the weekly started an award in the memory of Al Husseiny Abu Deif, a journalist who died in December 2012 during clashes among the demonstrators. On October 3, 2019, Facebook reported that it had removed El Fagr's accounts and pages on the Facebook and Instagram platforms due to the news organization conducting \\"Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior.\\" Facebook alleged that El Fagr had created fake accounts and pages posing as independent news organizations to mislead audiences across the Middle East and North Africa and criticize Iran, Turkey, and Qatar.

On Sunday, August 28, Canadian National Railway (CN) suspended all rail traffic on its lines south of McComb, Mississippi (lines owned by its subsidiary Illinois Central Railroad that extend into New Orleans), in anticipation of damage from the hurricane. To help ease the resumption of services after the storm passes, CN also issued an embargo with the Association of American Railroads against all deliveries to points south of Osyka, Mississippi. CSX Transportation also suspended service south of Montgomery, Alabama until further notice. Amtrak, America's rail passenger carrier, announced that the southbound City of New Orleans passenger trains from Chicago, Illinois, from August 29 through September 3, would terminate in Memphis, Tennessee, rather than their usual destination of New Orleans. The corresponding northbound trains would also originate in Memphis. The southbound Crescent from New York City, for the same period, terminated in Atlanta, Georgia, with the corresponding northbound trains originating in Atlanta as well. Amtrak's westbound Sunset Limited originated in San Antonio, Texas, rather than its normal origin point of Orlando, Florida. Amtrak announced that no alternate transportation options would be made available into or out of the affected area.\\"Service Alert: Hurricane Katrina Update - City of New Orleans, Crescent, Sunset Limited - Revised Service Information .\\" Amtrak. September 1, 2005. The Waterford nuclear power plant was also shut down on Sunday, August 28, before Katrina's arrival. =New Orleans= By August 26, the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered. Some computer models were putting the city of New Orleans right in the center of their track probabilities, and the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17% (with strike probability rising to 29% by August 28).\\"Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 15,\\" & \\"Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 21.\\" National Hurricane Center. August 26, 2005. This scenario was considered a potential catastrophe because 80% of the New Orleans metropolitan area is below sea level along Lake Pontchartrain. Since the storm surge produced by the hurricane's right-front quadrant (containing the strongest winds) was more than 20 ft (6 m) near Biloxi, emergency management officials in New Orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city, causing major flooding.Drye, Willie. \\"Hurricane Katrina Pulls Its Punches in New Orleans.\\" National Geographic. August 29, 2005. This risk of devastation had been known for some time; previous studies by FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers had warned that a direct hurricane strike on New Orleans could lead to massive flooding, which would lead to thousands of drowning deaths, as well as many more suffering from disease and dehydration, as the flood waters slowly receded from the city.Bourne, Joel K. \\"Gone with the Water .\\" National Geographic Magazine. October 2004.\\"Washing Away: Special Report from The Times-Picayune.\\" Times- Picayune. June 23‚Äì27, 2002. At a news conference 10:00 AM on August 28, shortly after Katrina was upgraded to a Category 5 storm, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin ordered the first ever mandatory evacuation of the city, calling Katrina, \\"a storm that most of us have long feared\\".Staff Writer. \\"Katrina Heads for New Orleans.\\" Fox News/Associated Press. August 29, 2005. To speed up the evacuations, authorities used contraflow lane reversal on Interstate 10 leading west of New Orleans, as well as on Interstate 55 and 59 leading north from the city. The city government also established a \\"refuge of last resort\\" for citizens who could not leave the city, at the massive Louisiana Superdome, which housed approximately 26,000 people with food and water for two days as the storm came ashore.Staff Writer. \\"26,000 shelter at Superdome.\\" Times- Picayune.

Fuel and rental cars were in short supply and many forms of public transportation had been shut down well before the storm arrived.Rulon, Malia; Scott, Katerine Hutt. \\"Evacuation plan failed to consider those without transportation.\\" Burlington Free Press. March 11, 2006. _(Dead link)_ The end result was that hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists were unable to evacuate and remained in the city. Nonetheless, some estimates claimed that 90-92% of the 1.3 million residents of the New Orleans metropolitan region evacuated including 80% of Orleans parish. More than 80,000 people were homeless.  Hurricane Pam Simulation  Months before Hurricane Katrina made landfall on New Orleans, a hurricane simulation was created to warn the city of a potential hurricane crisis and its devastating outcomes. The simulation was named Pam, in which a category 3 hurricane's strong winds and flooding caused the levee system of New Orleans to fail and leave the city underwater. Many emergency officials were stunned by the lack of response to Hurricane Pam's simulation, expressing their concerns that if a disaster like this did occur, the effects would be catastrophic. It was indeed confirmed that Pam's disaster plan was seen by FEMA and Louisiana state officials, to no avail. Under Hurricane Pam's disaster plan, it was decided that preparations for the hurricane should have been happening for three days prior to the hurricane's arrival on land. In New Orleans, a mandatory evacuation was not ordered by the city until approximately 20 hours before Hurricane Katrina made landfall. On top of this, it was important that officials representing FEMA had critical resources ready to go before the storm hit the city, which they failed to do so. While it is true that the authorities of the city and state government were mainly in charge of moving people to safety, Hurricane Pam's disaster plan noted that there was a scarcity of resources in support shelters for the state of Louisiana. Shortly thereafter the effects of Hurricane Katrina were evident, President Bush made it clear that he wanted there to be an investigation regarding the government's preparedness for and response to Hurricane Katrina.  National Weather Center Forecast and Warning Services  The National Weather Center's (NWS) services are provided collaboratively with several different offices that specialize in certain areas regarding the weather. Some of these offices include the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Hydro-meteorological Prediction Center (HPC). The NHC is a component for the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and the HPC is a provider of weather forecasts and analyses that support the NWS. The forecast for the estimated landfall of Hurricane Katrina, 2005. Along with this, the HPC supplies the NHC with precipitation statements. After what is considered a tropical storm progresses inward on land and the NHS terminates any alerts they put out, the HPC then accepts the authority of watching over the system. The two offices work hand in hand with one another to ensure the most accurate information is released to the public. The storm that became Hurricane Katrina was recognized by both the NHC and HPC on August 22. After waiting a few days to monitor development, the HPC started formulating precipitation statements for Hurricane Katrina on August 24. on August 30, the HPC accepted responsibility for the release of warnings regarding Katrina. On August 31, the hurricane system was consumed by a system near the Great Lakes of the east, so the HPC terminated their advisories for Katrina. The NHC and HPC are essential to one another, especially in that the HPC routinely executes service backup for the NHC. An example of this is when the HPC conducted a respective amount of drills for service backup in the summer months leading up to Katrina. During Hurricane Katrina's landfall, the NHC's implementation and execution of policies was seen as excellent by many government emergency officials. Throughout the tracking of Hurricane Katrina, the NHC's forecasts were very consistent and provided strong evidence for the intensity and power of the storm. Not only were the forecasts made by the NHC accurate, but they were also timely, which allowed for workforce management operation members to in turn provide accurate information to their counterparts. As well as the accuracy and timeliness of the NHC's forecast, it was precisely expected that Hurricane Katrina would be a massive hurricane that caused detrimental effects to the northern Gulf coast. What seemed shocking to many after Hurricane Katrina had passed was the government failing to do much about the forecasts released by the NHC. It seemed clear to many what the potential effects of Katrina could amount to, yet the storm was not treated how it should have been.  Congressional Committee Establishment  On September 15, 2005, it was announced that a Bipartisan Congressional Committee had been established to investigate the United States government's preparations for and responses to Hurricane Katrina. This decision was preceded by many different positions of members of the House of Representatives, which are outlined below. = Arguments for the Establishment of a Congressional Committee = Honorable David Dreier was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980. He was a Republican Representative from California, and served as the House Rules Committee's Chairman. The following information is regarding the House of Representatives' debate and more specifically, Honorable Dreier's viewpoint on whether to establish a Bipartisan Congressional Committee to investigate the U.S. government's preparations for Hurricane Katrina. Honorable Dreier agreed with President Bush when he claimed that there were many undesirable characteristics of the government's initial response to Hurricane Katrina. In his debate to the House of Representatives, Honorable Dreier expressed that the Federal Emergency Management System's (FEMA) department head had resigned after the events of Hurricane Katrina. He stated that from what happened during the disaster, there were certainly lessons to be taken away. He called for action from his fellow representatives that there must be an acceptance of the Executive Branch's powers to investigate what went wrong in the response to Hurricane Katrina. In his strong declaration to the House of Representatives, Honorable Dreier made it very clear that a Bipartisan Congressional Committee was necessary in order to follow the nation's precedents and traditions. As well as this, many delegates viewed an independent commission to be a ridiculous idea and redundant of sorts. They believe that Americans wanted immediate solutions to the hurdles they were being faced with as a result of the lack of preparation for Hurricane Katrina. = Arguments Against the Establishment of a Congressional Committee = In 1993, Honorable Bennie Thompson was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was a Democratic Representative from Mississippi, and served as the Mayor of Bolton from the years 1973 to 1979. He also serves as the Homeland Security Committee's Ranking Minority Member. Below is information regarding Honorable Thompson's viewpoint on whether to establish a Bipartisan Congressional Committee during the debate of the U.S. House of Representatives. Honorable Thompson's opposition began with his perspective that it is not necessary for a Congressional Committee to be entrusted with the investigation. He compared Congress being permitted to investigate the government's preparedness to a fox guarding a hen house, in which he stated that the government is not safeguarding what needs to be safeguarded. He strongly believed that instead of establishing a Congressional Committee, there should be an independent assessment of where the government went wrong. As the Ranking Minority Member of the Homeland Security Committee, he submitted a document outlining the complexity of the problems regarding what happened during Hurricane Katrina and the need for an independent assessment. As well as Honorable Bennie Thompson, many other delegates of the U.S. House of Representatives were not shy in sharing their viewpoints as to why there should not have been a Congressional Committee Established. They gave their perspectives on a variety of issues why a Congressional Committee was an inadequate idea. Many members of the Democratic party were not keen about establishing this Congressional Committee, as it would have been composed of mainly Republican delegates. The Democrats involved in voicing their opinions did not want the power to be only in the hands of the Republicans, and therefore, voted in opposition of the establishment.

In addition, she wrote a number of children's books. Biography Betham-Edwards was the fourth daughter of a farmer, Edward Edwards (c. 1808‚Äì1864) and his wife Barbara (1806‚Äì1848), daughter of William Betham (1749‚Äì1839), an antiquary and cleric.

Matilda studied French and German abroad and then settled with her sister in Suffolk to manage the farm which had belonged to her father. Not content, however, with purely rural occupations, she contributed from time to time to Household Words, having the advantage at this time of the friendship of Charles Dickens and an early association with Charles and Mary Lamb, friends of her mother. On her sister's death, she moved to London and wrote a number of novels of French life based on her frequent visits to France and her intimate knowledge of provincial French homes, as well as children's books, and non-fiction books about France. She was published by George and Richard Bentley.Women in the Literary Marketplace http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/womenLit/getting_into_print/Betham_Edwards_L.htm She stayed in Algeria with the feminist educationalist Barbara Bodichon and visited France and Spain with her. Of Huguenot descent, she considered France her second native land and made it her mission to bring about better understanding and sympathy between the two countries which shared her allegiance. In this way, she did much to promote a better understanding between English and French people. The French government made her an Officier de l‚ÄôInstruction Publique de France in recognition of her untiring efforts towards the establishment of a genuine and lasting entente cordiale.

The castle was built soon after the Norman Conquest by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, at the intersection of the River Nar and the Peddars Way. William constructed a motte-and-bailey castle during the 1070s, protected by large earthwork ramparts, with a large country house in the centre of the motte. Soon after, a small community of Cluniac monks were given the castle's chapel in the outer bailey; under William, the second earl, the order was given land and estates to establish Castle Acre Priory alongside the castle. A deer park was created nearby for hunting. After civil war broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about improving the defences of the castle. He began to build a tall keep on top of the motte, reinforcing the surrounding earthworks with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside the castle, surrounded by its own earthworks and walls, and the Peddars Way was redirected to pass by the castle, town and priory, all important symbols of the de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired the castle through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three large stone gatehouses in the castle and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact. The de Warennes continued to hold the castle until 1347, when it was inherited by Richard Fitzalan, the Earl of Arundel. By 1397 the fortifications were in ruins and, despite restoration work by Sir Edward Coke at the start of the 17th century, the decline continued until the 20th century. In 1971, Thomas Coke, the Earl of Leicester, placed the castle into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors. Historic England consider the castle's huge defensive earthworks to be \\"among the finest surviving in England\\".  History  = 11th century = Castle Acre Castle was built by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, in the manor of Acre during the 1070s. William was a Norman lord who had accompanied William the Conqueror in the conquest of England in 1066; he was rewarded with extensive estates across England. Acre was already an Anglo-Saxon estate centre and at the time of the invasion was owned by a wealthy man called Toki, but he was quickly replaced by Frederick, a Flemish lord and William's brother-in-law.; When Frederick died around 1070, William acquired control of the manor, which formed part of his massive land holdings across the region.; Remains of the keep, inner bailey and surrounding wall The castle was strategically located where the River Nar met the Peddars Way, an old Roman road, at the centre of Warenne's other estates in Norfolk, and may have been built on top of Toki's former house.; The castle had a motte-and-bailey design: its large outer and inner baileys were protected by earthworks and palisades, and a stone gatehouse was added to the inner bailey shortly afterwards. In the centre of the inner bailey was a grand double-hall built from stone, but this was not fortified and would have been more like a country house than a conventional Norman keep.; ; ; William gave St Mary's, the former parish church which was now surrounded by the castle's outer bailey, to the Cluniac order of monks, along with of farmland.; By 1088 a handful of monks had arrived from Lewes, where William had also founded a Cluniac community, to settle at the castle.; William's son, the second Earl William de Warrene, gave the monks a more spacious area of land to the west of the castle, probably in 1090, where they built Castle Acre Priory; the construction took a long time, and the priory was not fully completed until the 1160s. Monastic sites like the priory would have given their founders, and their associated castles, considerable prestige. A deer park was constructed near Castle Acre, with farmed rabbit warrens established around its edges.; ; = 12th century = Exterior view of the town's bailey gate Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy, invaded England in 1101 with the backing of many of the barons, but was persuaded to halt his campaign and return to Normandy after King Henry I bought him off with a substantial annuity. William de Warrenne had backed the duke during his campaign, however, and now found himself politically exposed. He was exiled and disseised of his English estates, including Castle Acre, until in 1103 the duke was able to persuade Henry to permit William to return and reclaim his lands. After 1135, a civil war known as the Anarchy broke out between the supporters of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda. William supported Stephen, as did his son, the third Earl William de Warenne, when he inherited the earldom in 1138.; There was fighting across much of the country, although less so in Norfolk, but William also faced challenges to his preeminence in the region from the growing power of the d'Albinis and de Vere families. In response, William remodelled Castle Acre Castle.; Around 1140, the earthworks were raised considerably and the double-hall was first strengthened, and then began to be converted into a very tall, square keep. The timber ramparts of the inner bailey were replaced with a stone wall, and the height of the earthworks around the outer bailey were raised and topped with a stone wall. A fortified, planned settlement was built alongside the castle around this time. The small community was not quite a proper town and was effectively dependent on the castle; such settlements are sometimes called burgus settlements or \\"castle-gate\\" towns.; ; The historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham suggest the settlement's earthwork defences and stone walls resemble an \\"enormous outer bailey\\" of the castle, rather a more conventional set of town walls. The walled settlement would have formed an important symbol of William's lordship. Remains of the west gatehouse in the outer bailey As part of these works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had previously run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south had to leave the main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching the southern end of the walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important symbols of the de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.; William died in 1148 while taking part in the Second Crusade, leaving the castle and lands to his daughter, Isabel de Warenne, who was then married to King Stephen's son, William of Bois. In 1153, however, Stephen faced a military stalemate in the civil war and agreed that Matilda's son, the future Henry II, should inherit the throne on his death, rather than William of Bois. Henry assumed power the next year and took control of various castles across England, including Castle Acre. Henry then married Isabel to his illegitimate brother, Hamelin de Warenne, in 1164, who acquired the castle along with the other de Warrenne lands. Hamelin changed the plan for the castle: the original ambition for the height of the keep was reduced and the southern half of the building was demolished. It is unclear if even this less ambitious building was ever completed. Hamelin also probably built the two gatehouses in the town, and the western gatehouse in the castle's outer bailey.; = 13th-14th centuries = The castle and settlement continued to be mostly held by the de Warennes until 1347. The castle was frequented by royalty, Henry III visiting the castle at least four times, and Edward I visiting five times. The seventh earl, John de Warenne, married Joan, the niece of Edward II, but the marriage failed and instead he chose to live with his mistress Maud Nereford.; This situation led to threats of excommunication.; In 1316, John therefore gave Castle Acre to Aymer de Valence, the Earl of Pembroke and England's Ambassador to Rome, probably to encourage him to present a petition to the Pope to annul the marriage the following year. John later reacquired the castle, but he died in 1347 with no legitimate heirs. Richard Fitzalan, the Earl of Arundel, inherited the estate but by 1397 the castle was in ruins. The surrounding settlement remained small and never became a borough, although the priory prospered.; = 15th-21st centuries = Cross-section of the castle motte, by Thomas Kerrich in 1782, showing the pilaster buttresses and battlements of the bailey walls, and the west gatehouse of the castle. The walls are now much lower and only the foundations of the gatehouse remains. After 1537, Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, leased the ruins of the castle and the adjacent priory, which had been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. His grandson, Thomas Howard, sold the properties to the financier Sir Thomas Gresham in 1558, and in turn they were purchased by first Thomas Cecil, the Earl of Exeter, and then in 1615 to Sir Edward Coke, a prominent lawyer. Edward, who was interested in history and possibly keen to reinforce his own credentials as a new entrant to the English elite, carried out repairs to the castle at a cost of ¬£60.; The castle was passed down within Coke's family, who became the earls of Leicester. Over the years the walls were robbed of their stone and the site used for grazing animals; the antiquarian Henry Harrod noted in 1857 that \\"every house in the neighbourhood has some of the stone-work of the castle...in its walls\\".; With the closure of the priory and the abandonment of the castle, the prosperity of the settlement of Castle Acre also declined. Antiquarian interest in the sites grew from the 18th century onward, and archaeological investigations took place in the 1850s and 1930s, but visitors were mostly more interested in the ruins of the priory than those of the castle. In 1971, Thomas Coke, the fifth Earl of Leicester, placed the castle into the guardianship of the state. Major archaeological excavations were carried out between 1972 and 1983, focusing on the inner bailey.; In the 21st century, the castle and the bailey gate are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors. The castle and the settlement defences are protected under UK law as a scheduled ancient monument, and the bailey gate is further protected as a Grade I listed building.;  Architecture  Plan of the castle and town defences: A ‚Äì bailey gate; B ‚Äì inner bailey and site of keep; C ‚Äì barbican; D ‚Äì castle west gate to town; E ‚Äì castle east gate to barbican; F ‚Äì outer bailey and site of former buildings; G ‚Äì town earthwork ramparts; H ‚Äì site of town's south gate; I ‚Äì River Nar Castle Acre Castle comprises three main earthworks: a motte and inner bailey to the north, an outer bailey to the south, and a barbican to the north-east. The medieval settlement of Castle Acre was linked to the western edge of the castle, and enclosed by its own circuit of earthwork defences and walls. Historic England consider the castle's huge defensive earthworks to be \\"among the finest surviving in England\\" The castle's large outer bailey is rectangular in shape, covering , surrounded by earth banks and, on the east and west, deep ditches. Fragments of its 12th-century stone walls survive in places. The main entrance to the castle came from the town through the north-west corner of the outer bailey; this was defended by a stone gatehouse and a portcullis, of which only the foundations now survive. Two other gates from the bailey led north-east into the barbican, and south down to the River Nar. The outer bailey would have contained a hall, kitchen, accommodation and a chapel, although only traces of these can now be seen on the surface. The route into the earthwork barbican was guarded by a gateway and a bridge. The barbican was designed to protect the castle's exposed north-eastern flank and had its own entrance from the eastern side. The inner bailey is reached by a bridge, which was originally made from wood, later rebuilt in stone, before replaced by the current steel version in the 20th century. The inner bailey comprises a roughly circular earthwork, up to high, topped by the remains of a stone curtain wall and protected by ditches, now about deep.; The earthworks form a raised motte, although they combine features of a circular ringwork.; The ruins of the 12th-century keep and the foundations of the 11th-century house, constructed from chalk rubble, remain visible and are surrounded by much of the rampart wall, made from chalk rubble and flint.; The planned settlement of Castle Acre was in size, covering . There are well-preserved ramparts along the west and south side, known as Dyke Hills, the surviving ditch being around wide and deep, and the bank high.; The bailey gatehouse was built from flint stone and defended with two drum towers and a portcullis. It survives largely intact, although is roofless. Parts of the settlement's stone wall survive alongside the bailey gatehouse, and along the southern ramparts.

On May 1st, 1890 Mr. Exall submitted the Belmont Plat Map to the City of Dallas. Belmont consisted of a 160-acre parcel from the original Allen Beard survey and a 10-acre parcel from the original Robert Ray Survey. The Belmont neighborhood is located near Lower Greenville. The neighborhood's boundaries are Greenville Avenue to the West, Skillman Avenue to the East. The North border is the center of LLano Ave. The South border is the center of Prospect Ave in the 5700 and 5800 blocks. I then turns South down the center of Delmar Ave to the center or Oram Ave and continues East down the Center of Oram to Skillman. Early history Colonel Exall planned to make Belmont the most attractive residential portion of Dallas. His plans included five-ft wide sidewalks, Macadamized streets, terraced lots. a Deed restrictions required all new homes to cost of at least $2,000 at the time of construction. Utilities and an artesian water well were also planned to run to each lot. However, when the panic of 1893 gripped the nation; the underdeveloped Belmont was sold at the Dallas County Courthouse on May 1, 1894, at 4 PM. The highest bidder was Adolphus Busch of St. Louis, MO. He paid $20,000 for the remaining lots. Mr. Busch had originally financed Exall for the Belmont purchase. The lots sat vacant for more that 17 years and they became overgrown with native Bois d‚ÄôArc trees, sunflowers, and weeds. On June 23, 1911, Mr. Busch's son, and heir, August Anheuser Busch, sold and financed 478 of the original 624 lots in Belmont to the Belmont Land Company. Ben T. Seay, a Belmont Addition property owner along with Rhodes S. Baker and Jeff D. Robinson, founded The Belmont Land Company just days before they purchased the land in 1911. The Belmont Land Company launched and aggressive and creative advertising campaign that put Belmont back on the map.  Architecture  Although a few of the original two-story homes and bungalows remain, the neighborhood has preserved most of its original charm and architectural styles. A combination of new and older homes in the Craftsman, Prairie, Colonial Revival, Tudors as well as other early 20th century architectural style homes, along with its mature trees and easygoing lifestyle, give this neighborhood a sense of place and time.  Belmont Conservation District  In 2004, the Belmont Conservation District was formed, through the passage of a Dallas City Ordinance, with the intent of preserving the unique character of the neighborhood.

The River War is a history of the British imperial involvement in the Sudan, and the Mahdist War between the British forces, led by Lord Kitchener, and the Dervish forces, led by Khalifa Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, heir to the self-proclaimed Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad who had embarked on a campaign to conquer Egypt, to drive out the Ottomans. The River War was Churchill's second published book after The Story of the Malakand Field Force, and originally filled two volumes with over 1000 pages in 1899. The River War was subsequently abridged to one volume in 1902. Background Aware that there was a war in Sudan, Churchill determined to be part of it. He was not alone in this, because in a time generally of peace, many British Army officers wanted experience of battle to further their careers. In Churchill's case, he did not see his career as lying with the army, but had already started writing about wars and wanted a new campaign to write about. He first attempted to obtain a transfer from his regiment stationed in India to the 21st Lancers, which was the unit taking part in the war. This was granted by the War Office, but rejected by the commander of the British force in Sudan, General Kitchener. Churchill next took leave to Britain, where he enlisted friends and family to lobby Kitchener to permit him to take part. This continued to be unsuccessful, even when the prime minister Lord Salisbury made an inquiry on his behalf. Eventually, however, he prevailed upon Sir Evelyn Wood, Adjutant General of the Horse Guards, who had authority over appointments to the regiment in England, and he received an attachment to the Lancers in place of an officer who had died, on 24 July 1898. On 5 August he was in Luxor and on 24 August the regiment set out from Atbara to attack the Mahdist forces. Before leaving London, Churchill obtained a commission to write accounts of the war for the Morning Post, producing 13 articles between 23 September and 8 October 1898 for which he was paid ¬£15 each. This helped offset his expenses for the trip, which the War Office had declined to meet, as well as refusing any liability should he be killed or injured. The Times had two correspondents covering the war, one of whom was killed and another injured, and Churchill wrote a piece for this newspaper also, but Kitchener vetoed the sending of the report. After the Battle of Omdurman the Lancers were ordered to return to other duties so Churchill's personal experience of the war ceased at that point. Although Omdurman had been taken from Khalifa Abdullahi, the Khalifa himself escaped and was not captured for another year. The campaign included a number of persons who were to play important parts in the First World War. Aside from Churchill and Kitchener, captains Douglas Haig and Henry Rawlinson became generals in the war, while Lieutenant David Beatty, then commanding a Nile gunboat, became an admiral and commanded the British Grand Fleet. Churchill returned to England to complete his leave, before returning to India for three months and finally resigning from the army. As a direct result of Churchill's writings, a rule was introduced prohibiting serving officers from also acting as war correspondents. This was one factor contributing to his leaving the army, since his earnings from writing were some five times greater than his army pay during his three years of army service. In India Churchill visited the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, who had himself written a history of \\"Persia and the Persian Question\\" eight years before. He read everything he could find containing background information about the Sudan. On the way home he stopped for two weeks in Egypt to visit Lord Cromer, then in charge of the Egyptian government, who read through the text and made suggestions and corrections; in particular playing down the popular impression of General Gordon, murdered by the Mahdi's forces fourteen years before, as a hero. While in Cairo he spoke to Slatin Pasha, author of a work about the Sudan, Sir Reginald Wingate, Director of Intelligence on Kitchener's staff, Edouard Girouard, responsible for building railways through Egypt which allowed the British advance, and others who had played some part. Sailing home across the Mediterranean, Churchill had as a fellow passenger George Warrington Steevens, who was also a war correspondent, working for the Daily Telegraph. They had met on a couple of previous occasions, and Churchill prevailed upon him also to read the manuscript. His suggestion was to reduce the degree of philosophising, that despite the accuracy of Churchill's commentary it might bore the reader. Content Illustrations by Angus McNeill, here showing how cable for the railway telegraph was carried and laid In vivid style the book describes the background to the war, the relationship of the Upper Nile to Egypt, the murder of General Charles George Gordon in the siege at Khartoum, the political reaction in England, and Kitchener's elaborate preparations for the war. While in the Sudan, Churchill participated in the Battle of Omdurman. Churchill comments at length on the mechanisation of war with use of the telegraph, railroad, and a new generation of weaponry. = 1899 unabridged, two-volume edition = The unabridged version contains many illustrations with drawings, photogravures, and coloured maps. It also contains vivid narratives of personal adventures of the author, his views on British expansionism, passages of deep reflection about the requirements of a civilised government, criticism of military and political leaders and religion. The first edition was reviewed by The Times, which described it as containing material sufficient for two good books and one bad one, with the bad one being the more interesting.The Times, 6 November 1899. About Islam he wrote: About the British attitude to war: About the modern machinery of war and its effectiveness against native tribesmen: Churchill spread his criticisms wherever he found fault. A passage was highly critical of General Kitchener for ordering the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb and carrying off his head as a trophy. The head was returned by the order of Lord Cromer, once he discovered what had happened. The matter was debated in parliament and led to a newspaper campaign against Kitchener as well as deepening the ill feeling which already existed between two men who as members of the British government in 1914 were expected to co-operate militarily as heads of the army and navy departments. All reference to the incident was removed from the second edition. Criticisms extended to the supplies for the troops: British soldiers were sent out from England with boots made substantially from cardboard, which rapidly disintegrated and had to be bound with cloth or string to hold together. While the Indian Army was equipped with highly effective Dum-dum bullets produced in India, British bullets sent to Egypt were simply pointed, and 1,000,000 rounds had to have their ends filed off to increase their effectiveness. The rough remodelling meant the bullets were inaccurate at long ranges, giving soldiers a choice of bullets able to hit their target but only wound, or killing bullets which were likely to miss and could jam the guns. Railway engines needed to carry troops and supplies into Sudan had to be obtained from all over the world as British companies were unable to supply at short notice. By contrast, American companies could supply locomotives immediately which were more effective and cheaper than some obtained from England. =1902 abridged, one-volume edition= In 1902 Churchill had become a member of parliament. It was thought that the commentary about some of the people mentioned had better be excised in a revised edition. The book was thus edited down to one single volume, removing approximately one third of the total. Much of the removed content included passages where Churchill recounted his own experiences, as he had done in other works, such as The Story of the Malakand Field Force. This removal gave the revised book a somewhat different feel to these others, and to its original form. Other removals included discussions on the ethics of warfare, Churchill's own opinions of events, and his assessment on Islam. The revised book was described as an authoritative history of the war. Abridgements were published numerous times over the twentieth century, with increasing excisions. A \\"definitive\\" new edition of the book, restoring it to the original two-volume text, edited and annotated by Professor James W. Muller is in preparation. Controversial contemporary political usage In May 2013, Missouri State Representative Rick Stream composed and forwarded an e-mail to his House GOP colleagues. Sam Levin called the e-mail \\"bizarre\\", with Rep. Stream alleging \\"dangers of Islam\\" and quoting Churchill's controversial statements. Also in May 2013, the Winston-Salem Journal published a commentary by columnist Cal Thomas, in which he criticized current United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron for his reaction following the killing of a British soldier in London, and invited him to take notice of Winston Churchill's views on Islam, some expressed in The River War. In April 2014, Paul Weston, chairman of the far right Liberty GB party was arrested in Winchester, Hampshire, for reading aloud passages from the book whilst standing on the steps of the Guildhall and not dispersing when ordered to do so. Weston, a candidate in the May 2014 European Elections, was quoting from a section of Churchill's book that described Islamic culture in unflattering terms. Criticism Johann Hari criticized Winston Churchill's views in his Not his finest hour: The dark side of Winston Churchill. The author also emphasizes the significance of Richard Toye's Churchill's Empire. In Churchill‚Äôs War, author Max Hastings makes this conclusion on Churchill's views: \\"Churchill‚Äôs view of the British Empire and its peoples was unenlightened by comparison with that of America‚Äôs president [Franklin Roosevelt], or even by the standards of his time.\\" Paul Rahe argues that reading The River War is suitable for \\"an age when the Great Democracies are likely to be called on to respond to ugly little conflicts marked by social, sectarian, and tribal rivalries in odd corners of the world.\\" References =Notes= External links *Unabridged first edition volume 1 *Unabridged first edition volume 2 *New York Times 1900 Review of The River War *A Churchillian Perspective on 11 September with a review of The River War Sources *The River War at Internet Archive (scanned books) *The River War at Project Gutenberg via Online Books (1902 abridged edition) * Books by Winston Churchill Books about military history British non- fiction literature 1899 books History books about Sudan Works about the Mahdist War ","title":"The River War"},{"id":"4017967","text":"The broad-leaved marsh orchidhttps://www.biolib.cz/en/taxon/id42147/ (Dactylorhiza majalis) is a terrestrial Eurasian orchid. Sub-species include: western marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. occidentalis), southern marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. praetermissa), Hebridean marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. ebudensis), and narrow-leaved marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. traunsteinerioides). The broad-leaved marsh orchid grows mainly in nitrogen-poor marsh areas that consist of several plant communities. More rarely, it is found in fens. Its flowering period begins at lower elevations as early as the beginning of May and ends in higher elevations at the end of July. The lowest blossoms usually open even before the stem has reached its full height.  Description  Detail of inflorescence The broad-leaved marsh orchid is usually tall, though some specimens may reach . Three to eight dark spotted leaves are distributed on the stem, which is hollow. The lower leaves are ovate to lanceolate and long and 1.5 to 3.5 cm (‚Öù to 1‚Öú in) wide. The upper leaves are increasingly smaller and more lanceolate. The bracts are about as long as the blossom and cover it before it blooms. The densely flowered inflorescence, which is long, is at first conical, but distinctly cylindrical when in full blossom. The seven to forty blossoms are colored purplish red, rarely light pink or white. The lateral tepals of the external circle of the perianth stand obliquely or vertically upright. They are 7 to 12 mm (¬º to ¬Ω in) long and 2.5 to 5 mm (‚Öõ to 3‚ÅÑ16 in) wide. The middle tepal is smaller and forms a \\"helmet\\" together with the two lateral tepals of the internal circle. These are 6 to 11 mm (¬º to 7‚ÅÑ16 in) long. The trilobate lip is 5 to 10 mm (3‚ÅÑ16 to ‚Öú in) long and 7 to 14 mm (¬º to 9‚ÅÑ16 in) wide. The shape and pattern of the lips are variable. In the lighter central area of the lip the markings are made up of lines, streaks, or dots. The spur is bent slightly downwards and is not quite as long as the ovary. The tuber has a palmate division and an irregular shape. The broad- leaved marsh orchid has a karyotype of two sets of forty chromosomes. The seed of this orchid contains no endosperm for the embryo. Therefore, germination can take place only by means of infection with a root fungus (mycorrhiza). The broad-leaved marsh orchid in a damp forest meadow in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Taxonomy In 1828 Ludwig Reichenbach described the broad-leaved marsh orchid as Orchis majalis. The name became the basionym after Peter Francis Hunt and Victor Samuel Summerhayes transferred the species to the genus Dactylorhiza in 1965. Sometimes the name Dactylorhiza fistulosa is used, but since this description is not valid, the name cannot be used despite its earlier publication in 1794 as Orchis fistulosa.

In many places, especially from western to northern Germany, it is extinct. In Switzerland the broad-leaved marsh orchid is also quite widespread. A significant gap is found south of the Aar between Aarau and Lake Neuch√¢tel.  Conservation  Although the broad-leaved marsh orchid is commonly found in some regions, it is nevertheless protected as an orchid. As with many marsh plants, the numbers of this species have been dwindling for quite some time. The main causes are the entry of nitrogen via fertilizer, drying out of the habitat, and intensive conversion to pasture. The broad-leaved marsh orchid does not react so sensitively to changes in its habitat as for example the early marsh orchid, Dactylorhiza incarnata. It is usually the last of the native orchids to disappear. This tolerance makes it a still relatively common species.

The syndrome involves defects in the nervous, auditory, skeletal, visual, and endocrine systems and encompasses numerous symptoms, bearing striking similarity to other known syndromes of neuroectodermal nature such as: Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome and Refsum syndrome. The onset of Flynn‚ÄìAird syndrome typically occurs between ten and twenty years of age, however, the earliest case was diagnosed at age seven. As the syndrome progresses, initial symptoms tend to intensify and new symptoms become apparent. Unlike related syndromes and despite the intensity of symptoms in the disease progression, Flynn‚ÄìAird syndrome does not appear to shorten life expectancy. The disease is characterized by early-onset dementia, ataxia, muscle wasting, skin atrophy, and eye abnormalities. In addition, patients have the potential of developing a number of other related symptoms such as: cataracts, retinitis pigmentosa, myopia (nearsightedness), dental caries, peripheral neuropathy (peripheral nerve damage), deafness, and cystic bone changes. This syndrome was first discovered in the early 1950s by American neurologists P. Flynn and Robert B. Aird who analyzed one family lineage inheritance pattern of this disease. Symptoms Individuals with this syndrome typically develop normally until reaching the second decade of their lives but the onset of symptoms has been observed as early as age seven. The first defect observed in individuals who suffer from this condition affects the auditory system and is known as bilateral nerve deafness. Another early symptom is the development of myopia (nearsightedness). In addition to bilateral nerve deafness and myopia, other symptoms that plague infected individuals early in disease progression include ataxia, muscle wasting, severe peripheral neuritic pain sometimes accompanied by elevated spinal fluid protein, and joint stiffness. The central nervous system (CNS) is affected with deficits in the cerebral cortex which indicate signs of mental retardation even though psychological observations appear relatively normal for individuals studied. Atypical epilepsy is also a common feature of CNS malfunctioning including aphasia expressions, blurred vision, and numbness of the face and limbs. In the third decade of the condition, individuals develop further visual problems including retinitis pigmentosa, and bilateral cataracts. Sufferers endure the restriction of visual fields, night blindness, and eventually severe or complete blindness. Individuals with this syndrome exhibit many physical deformities including skeletal, epidermal, and subcutaneous abnormalities. The skeletal problems are characterized by scoliosis and muscle weakness indicative of the kyphoscoliotic type which follow muscle wasting and peripheral neuritis (nerve inflammation). Osteoporosis is also observed in many cases. Skin and subcutaneous atrophy is common as well as skin ulcerations due to inability of the skin to heal. One of the final manifestations of disease is baldness. There is no evidence that the progression of Flynn‚ÄìAird syndrome shortens the patient's life-span, but the terrible conditions certainly increase morbidity. Genetics One family of 68 individuals over 5 generations was studied and the prevalence of disease among the family members suggests that it is indicative of dominant inheritance that is not sexually linked. This is supported by the fact that the disease failed to skip generations even in the absence of intermarriages and that disease incidence was independent of sex. The current findings suggest that the cause of the disease could be narrowed down to one enzymatic defect that is involved in the development of neuroectodermal tissue, however the exact molecular mechanisms are currently unknown. The other symptoms that arise such as bone defects and diabetes may be secondary to this enzymatic defect. Pathophysiology The exact pathophysiological mechanism of Flynn‚ÄìAird syndrome is unknown. However, several theories are in place with regards to the nature of this disease including the presence of a genetically defective enzyme involving a neuroectodermal tissue constituent. This explanation provides evidence for the late onset of the condition, the intricate findings, the varied nature of the disorder, as well as the genetic incidence. In addition, some aspects of the condition may be linked to a suppressing (S) gene due to the fact that only a small amount of stigmata appeared while the defects were still transmitted in the family studied. A suppressing gene down regulates the phenotypic expression of another gene, especially of a mutant gene. Other abnormalities may be due to endocrine system diseases. Diagnosis Treatment Only symptomatic treatment for the management of disturbances can be indicated for affected individuals. The genetic origin of this disease would indicate gene therapy holds the most promise for future development of a cure. But at this time no specific treatments for Flynn‚ÄìAird syndrome exist. History P. Flynn and Robert B. Aird observed this neuroectodermal syndrome after studying one family whose members suffered a number of neurological symptoms that were consistent from generation to generation. A number of the symptoms overlapped with several known neurological diseases such as Werner syndrome, Refsum syndrome, and Cockayne syndrome, which could be indicative of similar causative origins. However, these syndromes are recessively inherited as opposed to the dominant inheritance seen in the family studied by P. Flynn and Robert B. Aird. About 15% of family members exhibited full-blown symptoms characteristic of the disease while others showed some symptoms that overlapped with the general clinical manifestation of the syndrome. Research Following the initial inquiry by P. Flynn and Robert B. Air, only two case studies have been published in Germany and Japan respectably but are not currently accessible. At this time there are no indication of further scientific investigation of Flynn‚ÄìAird syndrome. However, there is research on other, more common syndromes such as Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome and Refsum syndrome that may help better understand Flynn‚ÄìAird syndrome.

His eldest brother, James Drummond (1615‚Äì1675), inherited his father's titles and became the 3rd Earl of Perth. His mother was the eldest daughter of Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe and the former Margaret Maitland, the only daughter and eventual heiress of William Maitland of Lethington. His paternal grandparents were Patrick Drummond, 3rd Lord Drummond and Lady Elizabeth Lindsay (the daughter of David Lindsay, 9th Earl of Crawford). His brother's son, James Drummond, 4th Earl of Perth, was created the Duke of Perth in the Jacobite Peerage in 1701. Peerage and career As both of his maternal uncles predeceased his grandfather, the 1st Earl of Roxburghe, without a male heir to inherit his titles and estates, nominated his grandson William for the honours in 1648. William changed his surname to Ker and, by special arrangement ratified by Parliament in 1661, inherited the titles and estates of his grandfather. In 1660 and 1661, he served as Privy Councillor and in 1668, he served as Col. of Foot with the Roxburgh and Selkirk Militia. Personal life On 17 May 1655, Roxburghe married his cousin, the Hon. Jane Ker, eldest daughter, and heir of line, of his late uncle, the Hon. Harry Ker (from his grandfather's second marriage to Jean Drummond, who was also his father's younger sister) and Lady Margaret Hay (the only daughter of William Hay, 10th Earl of Erroll and Lady Anne Lyon, daughter of Patrick Lyon, 1st Earl of Kinghorne). After his uncle died, Lady Margaret remarried to John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis. Together, they were the parents of: * Hon.

Afterwards he moved to Vienna, where he continued his studies of conducting and at the faculty of piano of the local Music Academy. A talented pianist, he was persuaded by his friend Imr√© K√°lm√°n to devote himself to popular rather than classical music. In Vienna he also debuted as a composer for Alexander Vertinsky, a renowned Russian poet and songwriter, famous for his romances. Return to Poland Upon his return to Poland, with his cousin Artur Gold, he co-founded the Petersburski & Gold Orchestra, which performed at the fashionable nightspot Adria. He became well known for music for cabaret and theaters in Warsaw. Among them was Julian Tuwim's and Marian Hemar's Qui Pro Quo, one of the most famous Polish cabarets of the interbellum. In late 1920s and 1930s, Petersburski became one of the most popular Polish composers as several of his songs became hits on Polish Radio and in music theatres throughout the country.

Also the performers of Petersburski's songs added to his popularity: Wera Bobrowska (Ju≈º nigdy), Hanka Ordon√≥wna (Sam mi m√≥wi≈Çe≈õ), Tola Mankiewicz√≥wna (Ty, mi≈Ço≈õƒá i wiosna), Ludwik Sempoli≈Ñski (Ca≈Ça przyjemno≈õƒá), Ch√≥r Dana and Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg (Bez ≈õladu) and Adolf Dymsza (Ja i ≈ºonka ma). Despite being the writer of numerous waltzes and foxtrots, as well as two operettas (Kochanka z ekranu and Robert i Bertram), Petersburski is best known for his tangos. In 1928 he composed a song for Stanis≈Çawa Nowicka titled Tango Milonga in Polish. The song became a major hit and was almost instantly translated to several languages, gaining much popularity abroad, both in Europe and in America (the English and German title being Oh, Donna Clara. The song was sung by many foreign artists, including Al Jolson, Henry Varny and √âdith Piaf. > \\"Another of his tango compositions that attained international recognition > was To Ostatnia Niedziela (The Last Sunday) (1933) with lyric by Zenon > Friedwald describing the final meeting of former lovers who are parting.

Air Force Service During the September campaign (Polish Defensive War) of 1939 Petersburski served with the Polish Air Force. After the country was overrun, he moved to the Soviet-occupied part of Poland. In 1940 he was allowed to continue his career and became the leader of the Belarusian Jazz Orchestra band. He performed many of his pre-war hits with new, Russian language lyrics. Among the original compositions of that time was the very popular waltz Sinii Platochek (The Blue Handkerchief, Polish title Blekitna chusteczka) performed by Klavdiya Shulzhenko, which became a popular folk song under the name The 22 June. Another of his popular Russian songs (performed by, among others, the Isaak Dunayevsky's Orchestra) was Utomliennoye solntse (Weary sun), in fact a Russian version of his pre-war To ostatnia niedziela. See also Burnt by the Sun. He also reorganized the Petersburski & Gold orchestra, this time together with Artur's brother Henryk Gold. After the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement of 1941 he joined the Polish II Corps under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders. Evacuated with the rest of the Polish Army to Persia, he moved to Cairo where he started working for the Polish Radio. In 1947 he traveled, via Palestine, to Brasil, where he had a piano duo with his friend from pre-war Poland, also a Jewish composer, Alfred Schuetz. From 1948 to 1968 he lived in Argentina, working with 'Radio El Mundo' in Buenos Aires. During this time, he composed the hit song All Roads Lead to Buenos Aires, part of which became a famous radio jingle. He also co-led the El Nacional theatre orchestra with the famous Polish-Jewish cabaret actor Lopek (Kazimierz Krukowski). After the death of his wife Maria Minkowska during the earthquake in 1967, Petersburski moved to Caracas, Venezuela and in 1968 returned to Poland. In 1968, after resettling in his beloved Warsaw, he married Sylwia Klejdysz, an opera singer. He died in 1979 in Warsaw. His son, Jerzy Petersburski Jr., was born in 1969. Death Jerzy Petersburski died on 7 October 1979 in Warsaw and is buried in PowƒÖzki Cemetery.

He is the author of 27 books on jurisprudence and international law, and is hailed by his official biography at the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence as one of the premier legal theorists.Biography of Julius Stone , Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence, Sydney Law School, University of Sydney. URL accessed 5 May 2006. Early life Stone was born in Leeds, England to parents who were poor Lithuanian Jewish refugees. Education Stone received a scholarship to Oxford University, where he earned Bachelor of Arts (Jurisprudence), Bachelor of Civil Law and Doctor of Civil Law degrees. He followed this with a Master of Laws from Leeds University, and then a Doctor of Juridical Science from Harvard University. Career Stone taught at Harvard, and briefly at Leeds, then went to New Zealand where he worked at Auckland University College. In 1942, he was appointed Challis Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the University of Sydney, a position he held until 1972. Stone's appointment was controversial for several reasons; he was perceived to have a radical jurisprudential stance, some wanted the Chair to be held open until the end of the war as it was suggested that there were suitable candidates in active service. It was suspected that the fact that he was a Jew also played a role. A debate over his appointment was carried out in both the Australian parliament and local newspapers; the Chancellor of the University, and two Fellows of the University Senate, resigned in protest. This early experience of anti-Semitism influenced his lifelong commitment to justice, according to his biographer, Leonie Star (Star 1993). Stone has been described by his official JSIJ biography as having \\"a life-long commitment to Israel\\" and in the Sydney Law Review as having an emotional and \\"fierce loyalty to the State of Israel\\" that led some of his colleagues to \\"express fear even to discuss Israel with him\\". In 1972, Stone moved to the University of New South Wales, where he was a visiting Professor of Law until his death in 1985. While at University of New South Wales, he concurrently held the position of Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the Hastings College of Law, University of California. In 1999, 15 years after Stone's death, the University of Sydney established an institute of jurisprudence which was named after him, the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence.The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence Accessed 21 January 2011 Influence Stone influenced generations of lawyers who studied at University of Sydney. For most of his time there, the Law School was a practice-based school and students learnt what they needed to become practising lawyers. According to A J Brown of Griffith University, the former Justice of the High Court of Australia Michael Kirby was heavily influenced at university by Stone. =Israeli settlements= Stone's view is that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are legal under international law, and do not constitute a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention (Article 49(6)). He stated: \\"Irony would...be pushed to the absurdity of claiming that Article 49(6), designed to prevent repetition of Nazi-type genocidal policies of rendering Nazi metropolitan territories judenrein, has now come to mean that...the West Bank...must be made judenrein and must be so maintained, if necessary by the use of force by the government of Israel against its own inhabitants. Common sense as well as correct historical and functional context excludes so tyrannical a reading of Article 49(6.)\\"The Settlements Issue: Distorting the Geneva Convention and the Oslo Accords Honours *Award of the American Society of International Law (1956). *Honorary life member of the American Society of International Law (1962). *Swiney Prize for Jurisprudence from the Royal Society of Arts (1964). *World Research Award from the Washington Conference on World Peace through Law (1965). *The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence at Sydney Law School, University of Sydney is named in his honour.

Mazur's research is in experimental ultrafast optics and condensed matter physics. Born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Leiden University. Education Mazur studied physics and astronomy at Leiden University. He passed his \\"doctoraal examen\\" (equivalent to a master's degree) in 1977 and continued his graduate studies at the same institution. In 1981 he obtained his Ph.D on a thesis entitled \\"The structure of non-equilibrium angular momentum polarizations in polyatomic gases\\". Although he intended to go on to a career in industry with Philips N.V. in Eindhoven, he left Europe at the urging of his father, Peter Mazur, to pursue a postdoctoral study with recent Nobel laureate Nicolaas Bloembergen at Harvard University. Career After two years as a postdoc, Mazur was offered a position of assistant professor at Harvard University. In 1987 he was promoted to associate professor and obtained tenure three years later in 1990. Mazur currently holds a chair as Balkanski Professor of Physics and Applied Physics jointly in the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and in the Physics Department. He is also the Dean of Applied Physics. Research Mazur's early work at Harvard focused on the use of short-pulse lasers to carry out spectroscopy of highly vibrationally excited molecules. Mazur and his group have made many pioneering contributions to the field of ultrashort laser pulses and their interactions with matter (\\"femtosecond material science\\"). In 1989 his group was one of the first in academia to build a colliding-pulse mode-locked laser, which generated pulses of only 70 femtosecond duration. After early measurements by Mazur's group demonstrated conclusively that solids can undergo a structural phase transition without appreciable heating of the lattice, Mazur's group developed a technique to measure the full dielectric function of highly excited semiconductors. Since then the group's use of this technique and various nonlinear optical probes to study laser-induced structural phase transitions. In parallel to the work on semiconductors, Mazur began studying the interaction of intense femtosecond pulses with transparent materials. By tightly focusing a laser pulse in the bulk of a transparent material nonlinear optical absorption occurs inside the material, leading to extreme high temperatures and material changes at the focus. This femtosecond laser micromachining technique is now widely used for data storage, fabrication of integrated optical components, and microsurgery. A light-conducting silica nanowire wraps a beam of light around a strand of human hair. The nanowire is about one-thousandth the width of the hair. Credit: Limin Tong, Harvard UniversityIn 1998 a serendipitous discovery in Mazur's laboratory led to the development of a new method to form a silicon surface modification, called \\"black silicon\\" because of its very low reflectivity. After irradiation by a train of femtosecond laser pulses in the presence of a halogen containing gas, the surface of silicon develops a self-organized microscopic structure of micrometer-sized cones. The resulting material has many remarkable properties, such as an enhanced absorption that extends to the infrared below the band gap of silicon. The material has found commercial applications in a number of photodetectors. Mazur's research continues to focus on ultrashort laser pulse interactions and novel nonlinear optical devices. In collaboration with a group from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, Mazur's group was the first to develop a technique for pulling subwavelength diameter silica optical fibers. These wires guide light in the form of an evanescent wave, permit very sharp bending of the light. Peer instruction In 1991, Mazur began designing an instructional strategy for teaching called peer instruction. In 1997, he published a book called Peer Instruction: A User's Manual which provides details on this strategy. Peer Instruction (PI) has been found to be more beneficial than class-wide discussion or lecture. In fact, according to an article in the March/April 2009 edition of Complexity, over 90% of instructors who have tried PI plan to continue to use it and incorporate it more into teaching. The seating arrangement plays an important role in the outcome of this method. For example, when low-performing students are seated in the front, their chance to do better increases. Meanwhile, the results of high-performing students who are seated in the back are not affected. In addition, when high-performing students are seated in the outer four corners of the classroom, the performance of the class as a whole increases. Entrepreneurship Mazur has founded or co-founded at least two technology start-ups: SiOnyx, which makes infrared sensors,http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2013/05/sionyx-image- sensor-tech-night-vision.html?page=all and Learning Catalytics, which in April 2013 he sold to the Pearson educational corporation.

Its residents are called \\"GraLighiotes\\". They are occupied mainly in the agriculture sector; this is the main source of income for the residents and their income per capita is one of the highest in the region. The village is surrounded by greenhouses which demonstrates that the agriculture sector is modernized. There are many firms in related fields such as agriculture companies that co-operate with multinationals. In recent years there has been a lot of development in the village's standard of living. Young people can enjoy the presence of cafeterias, internet cafes, snack bars, kebab shops, and DVD rentals. Major shops are Linux cafe (internet cafe), gyrovolies (kebab shop), Joanna (clothwear), Avantage (cafe bar) and others. There are two relatively big supermarkets and several corner shops that give a good shopping and leisure environment to the community. The community enjoys high multicultural environment as a lot of immigrants live here and contribute to the local economy mainly as manual workers. The immigrants are mainly for countries of the former Communist bloc. The majority of them comes from Bulgaria and Albania, but also from countries such as Poland, Russia etc. Sports are highly popular in the village, especially football and basketball. The basketball team of Lygia won the double in the local championship of the Cretan League and got promoted in the Third National Division for the 2006-2007 season. There are some sports facilities such as a basketball and volleyball court in the elementary school and a small football stadium in the Kotsyfiani church area. The beach of the village The village is near the seaside looking over to the Libyan Sea and is a great place for swimming and summer sports. Each summer some tournaments such as beach football are organised at the local beach. During the summer the beach is very popular as a lot of people with origins from Gra-Lighia spend their holidays in the village. Local people enjoy sailing and fishing and they possess small boats that one can see in the marina of the village. A big problem for this community is the dangerous road network that surround the village and lead to deadly accidents especially among youth that use motorbikes.

The vampires in the canonical Buffyverse differ greatly from those that appear in the 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie. The movie's vampires are able to fly, look pale but relatively human, and do not crumble to dust when killed. The canonical vampires, introduced in the first episode of the television series, are demonic spirits that inhabit human corpses.\\"Lie to Me\\", Season 2 episode 7 Because of their partly human nature, vampires are considered impure by other demons who sometimes call them \\"blood rats\\". According to Rupert Giles, when the ancient race of demons called the Old Ones were banished from Earth, the last one fed on a human and mixed their blood, creating the first vampire.\\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", pilot episode According to Illyria, vampires existed during her time as an Old Onelong before the rest were banished from the realm. Vampires possess all the memories and skills of their human predecessors. They also retain much of their host's personality, including any mental illnesses or emotional instabilities. For example, Spike (unlike most vampires) retained his love for his dying mother and Harmony kept her vain, shallow valley girl personality and her love of unicorns. Darla tells the newly turned Liam/Angelus that \\"what we were informs what we become\\"; after her resurrection as a human she says that the darkness he unleashed as Angelus was always in him as a human, long before they met. Vampires possess superhuman abilities, such as increased strength, heightened senses, and accelerated healingall of which increase as they grow older or when they drink the blood of powerful supernatural creatures. They can drain animalsincluding humansof their blood in a few seconds. Vampires are immortal and can live indefinitely without any signs of aging, though extremely old vampires acquire demonic features such as cloven hooves for hands, and lose their resemblance to humans. Vampiresexcept those who are skilled with powerful magic such as Count Draculacannot shape-shift. Vampires in the Buffyverse live on a diet of blood, preferring fresh human blood; they can distinguish the blood of different animals by flavor, and those who do not drink human blood enjoy that of otters. They require no other food or drink, and although they can ingest it they generally find it bland. Prolonged deprivation of blood can impair a vampire's higher brain functions and they become \\"living skeletons\\",\\"Pangs\\", Season 4, episode 8 but lack of blood will not result in a vampire's death. They do not need to breathe airalthough they can breathe to speak or smokeand they cannot pass breath on to others via CPR. They are affected by drugs, poisons, and electricity and they can be sedated and tasered. Some vampires enjoy both alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, and tobacco. Vampires can change at will between human appearance and a monstrous form with a pronounced brow ridge, yellow eyes, and sharp teeth. They make a roaring sound when angered. In human form, they can be detected by their lack of heartbeat and lower body temperature. They do not cast reflections, although they can be photographed and filmed. They are largely immune to mind- reading,Earshot but Willow Rosenberg can telepathically communicate with vampires such as Spike.The Gift Vampires can be killed by beheading, burning with fire or sunlight, or by penetration of the heart by a wooden object. When killed, a vampire rapidly turns to dry dust. They heal quickly from most injuries but do not regrow lost limbs (although Spike was able to use his hands when they were reattached after being amputated by a mentally disturbed Slayer) and can acquire scars. Their flesh burns in direct sunlight, and on contact with blessed objects such as holy water, a Bible, recently consecrated ground or a Christian cross. They can enter consecrated buildings but appear to feel ill at ease. Vampires are attracted to bright colors and are said to dislike garlic.The Wish Vampires cannot enter a human residence without having been invited once by a living resident; however, once given, such an invitation can only be revoked by a magic ritual. If all living residents die, vampires can enter freely. Areas open to the public and the homes of other vampires, demons, and non-humans are not protected. To reproduce, vampires must drain a human being of most of his or her blood, then force the victim to drink some of the vampire's blood. This process is known as \\"siring\\", and the vampire who does so is called a \\"sire\\". Sires often act as mentors to their 'children' and form small covens of related vampires for various purposes. Some vampires can be telepathically linked to those that they have sired.Angel season 1 episode \\"Somnambulist\\" The amount of time it takes for a new vampire to rise seems to vary; Buffy often kills vampires as they rise from their graves but other vampires rise after only a few hours. There is no explanation given for this in the series. They cannot normally reproduce sexually, but Jasmine manipulates events that allow Angel and Darla to conceive a son, Connor, who has a human soul with vampire-like abilities, but none of their weaknesses or need to drink blood. Vampires in the Buffyverse do not have human souls, but Giles in \\"The Harvest\\" says the human corpse a vampire is born into is infected with a demon soul via vampiric blood, and therefore lacks a conscience. Angel and Spikevampires who have had their human souls restored to themfeel remorse for their previous actions. However, soulless vampires are capable of feeling human emotions such as love, though these tend to be expressed as twisted and obsessive behavior. Variations of vampires are seen on both Buffy and Angel. In the Angel season two episode \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", Angel and his team travel to a parallel world, Pylea, where he becomes a \\"Van-Tal\\" demon with green skin, spines and a bestial appearance. This form is described by Wesley as the vampire (specifically the demon that creates the vampire) in its purest form. While in this form, Angel lacks the ability to reason, possessing neither the compassion his soul gives him nor the sadism he possesses as Angelus. The seventh season of Buffy introduces the Turok-Han, an ancient species of vampire analogous to Neanderthal man.\\"Never Leave Me\\" Season 7 episode 9 These Turok-Han, colloquially referred to as \\"√ºber-vamps\\", are stronger and harder to kill than common vampires, can usually withstand a stake to the chest without dusting and show only minor burns when doused with holy water, but can still be killed by beheading or sunlight. The Turok-Han show very little intelligence and cannot speak. At the end of Season Eight, Buffy destroys the Seed of Wonder, affecting the magical world but not active demons and vampires on Earth. All new vampires sired after the Seed's destruction rise as mindless, feral creatures that Xander Harris dubs \\"zompires\\". However, at the end of Season Nine, after rogue slayer Simone Doffler's experiment to create an ultimate vampire upon the slayers who followed her, one slayer, Vicki, has risen as a vampire after Doffler's death who exhibits the abilities of immunity to sunlight and shape shifting. During the beginning of Season Ten, Vicki and the new breed of vampires she sired are shown to be as strong and able withstand a stake to the chest as Turok-Han, however exhibiting a new vulnerability to silver as werewolves. Creation A vampire \\"dusting\\". The writers felt that having vampires disintegrate after death would be convenient for the story. The idea of the \\"vamp faces\\" ‚Äî to have vampires' human features distort to become more demonic ‚Äî was implemented because Whedon wanted to have high school students that the other characters could interact with normally only to discover that these people would turn out be vampires, creating a sense of paranoia. He also wanted to make the vampires look demonic, stating, \\"I didn't think I really wanted to put a show on the air about a high school girl who was stabbing normal-looking people in the heart. I thought somehow that might send the wrong message, but when they are clearly monsters, it takes it to a level of fantasy that is safer.\\" In early episodes, the vampires appeared \\"very white-faced, very creepy, very ghoulish\\". This was changed in later seasons to make the vampires look more human because of the sympathetic vampire character Angel and because elaborate make-up was time-consuming. Whedon said that people thought the white faces were \\"funny looking\\" but found it creepy, comparing it to the monsters in zombie movies such as Day of the Dead and The Evil Dead. The character of the Master was designed to be in permanent vamp face to highlight his age and make him appear animalistic. Make-up artist John Vulich based the Master's appearance on a bat, saying that the character has devolved to a more primal, demonic state over the years. It was decided that vampires and their clothes would turn to dust after they died. The introduction to one episode, \\"The Wish\\", parodied this vampiric trait; when Buffy kills a non-humanoid demon, Willow wonders why the demon corpse \\"doesn't go poof\\" and must be buried. Joss Whedon had the vampires explode into dust because it was practical, it demonstrates that they are monsters, he did not want a high school girl killing bad guys every episode and have them clean up bodies for 20 minutes, and it also \\"looks really cool\\". In the first episode, vampires' clothes reflect the era in which they died. Joss Whedon felt this concept was a \\"charming notion\\" but rejected it because he believed that if every vampire in the show were dressed in old-fashioned clothes they would cease to be scary. When creating the vampire \\"rules\\" that they would use in the show, the writers used elements from existing vampire lore. They decided the vampires would not fly as in the Buffy movie because they could not make flying vampires look convincing on a television budget. Garlic is mentioned or used as vampire repellent in a few episodes, but its effect on vampires is never stated. Some established rules, such as a vampire's inability to enter a home uninvited, both helped and hindered the storytelling. Whedon said that whereas shows such as The X-Files spend time explaining the science behind the supernatural and making it as real as possible, Buffy and Angel are more concerned with the emotion resulting from these creatures and events than justifying how they could conceivably exist. The shows therefore tend to gloss over the details of vampire and demon lore, simply using the Hellmouth as a plot device to explain unexplainable things.

Bavetta (born December 10, 1939) is an American retired professional basketball referee for the National Basketball Association (NBA). Since starting in 1975, he had never missed an assigned game and holds the league record for most officiated games with 2,635. He has recently been implicated in allegations of game fixing (in the Whistleblower podcast and the investigation into Tim Donaghy) - most notably the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Lakers. His game on April 12, 2013 in Washington was his 2,600th consecutive game as an NBA official. Early life Bavetta was born in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York on December 10, 1939. His father was an officer for the New York Police Department, and his mother was a homemaker. Bavetta attended Power Memorial Academy in New York City (the same school future NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar attended) and is a 1962 graduate of St. Francis College in New York and played on the schools' basketball teams. He began officiating after his brother, Joe, who officiated for the American Basketball Association, convinced him that it would be an interesting career. A Wall Street broker for Salomon Brothers with an MBA in finance from the New York Institute of Finance, Bavetta began officiating games between fellow brokers in the Wall Street League, played at New York's Downtown Athletic Club, and later worked high school games. For ten years, he officiated Public and Catholic High School leagues in New York and later nine years in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, which later became the Continental Basketball Association. NBA officiating career In the mid-1960s, he began to attend regional referee tryouts in the hopes of becoming an NBA referee; however, he was rejected for eight straight years due to his small physique and unimposing size. Bavetta was finally hired by the NBA in 1975 following the retirement of Mendy Rudolph. He debuted December 2, 1975 at Madison Square Garden in an NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics. His first ten years in the league were tough as he was constantly ranked bottom among NBA referees in performance evaluations and led the league in technical fouls and ejections called. To improve his officiating, Bavetta refereed games for the New Jersey pro league and Rucker League in Harlem during the off-seasons and studied NBA rulebooks. In 1983, he became the first referee to undergo rigorous physical training. He ran six to eight miles and took three-hour naps every day. His effort paid off when he emerged as one of the best referees. In the 1980s, he was named chief referee, who has the power to approve or overrule calls made by other officials. He was assigned to officiate his first playoff game in 1986. Bavetta's most memorable game occurred during a 1980s nationally televised contest between the Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics when he was forced to officiate an NBA game by himself after his partner, Jack Madden, broke his leg in a collision with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson. At one point in the game, Celtics forward Larry Bird and 76ers guard Julius Erving began to strangle each other and were ejected by Bavetta. Bavetta believed that this game assisted in the progression of his career in the NBA. From 1990 to 2000, Bavetta regularly refereed playoff games and was ranked at the top among referees in terms of performance evaluation. In 2000, he was one of the highest-paid referees in the NBA, earning over $200,000 a year. Among those playoff games included Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, in which Bavetta ruled that a three-point basket made by Howard Eisley of the Utah Jazz was released after the shot clock buzzer sounded and thus would not count. However, television replays on NBC showed otherwise. Bavetta's career was threatened when he was accidentally hit in the nose by Pacers forward Jalen Rose, who was trying to punch Knicks center Patrick Ewing during a 1999 game between the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks. Bavetta did not leave the game immediately, opting to wait until later in the day to have surgery. He returned the next day to officiate an Atlanta Hawks-New Jersey Nets game. On February 8, 2006, Bavetta officiated his 2,135th NBA game, setting a league record for most games officiated that was previously held by Jake O'Donnell. Bavetta said the secret to his longevity was \\"wearing five pairs of socks\\", which he claims helped keep his feet in good shape. Contributing to his good health, Bavetta says he runs five to eight miles every day. For his longevity in the league, he has received the nickname \\"the Cal Ripken, Jr. of referees\\". During the 2006‚Äì07 season, Bavetta officiated a December 16, 2006 game between the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets. The game involved a brawl where all ten players on the court were ejected by Bavetta and his officiating crew. The league eventually suspended seven players for a total of 47 games and fined both teams $500,000. After 39 years of officiating in the NBA, Bavetta officially retired on August 19, 2014 having officiated 2,635 consecutive regular season games. =Charitable works= Bavetta is also actively involved in charitable works. He has established and financed the Lady Bavetta Scholarships since 1986 in honor of his daughters, awarded to high school minority children based on their needs. He has volunteered since 1992 with Double H Hole in the Woods Ranch working with children and teens with a multitude of medical special needs. He also works with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and serves as the Upstate New York Regional Director for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. During the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend, Bavetta raced Turner Network Television (TNT) studio analyst and former NBA player Charles Barkley for a $75,000 charitable donation ($50,000 contributed by the NBA and $25,000 by TNT) to the Las Vegas Boys & Girls Clubs of America, but lost by a narrow margin. The distance of the race was three and one half full lengths of the court (or 329 feet). Bavetta lost the race despite a last- second dive and Barkley running the last portion of the race backwards. The dive resulted in an abrasion injury to Bavetta's right knee. Controversies =Altercations with Earl Strom= According to Darryl Dawkins' autobiography, Bavetta was officiating an NBA game during the mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Earl Strom as his partner for that game. Bavetta overruled Strom on a crucial last-second personal foul call against the Nets, which would have been a victory for the 76ers. When the game ended and players were walking to their respective locker rooms, the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was allegedly ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, \\"You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?\\" Strom was fined for the incident. Bavetta had another altercation with Strom when Strom tried to choke Bavetta before an NBA game in 1989. Strom reportedly apologized within two weeks of the incident. =Allegations of game fixing= Bavetta was one of three referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Kings and the Lakers. Former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged that at least one of the referees working this game had subjective motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome. NBA rules prohibited active referees from commenting on the situation publicly. The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game. In a 2002 article, Bill Simmons named the worst officiated games of the prior four years, alleging that the games involved either extending a series so it did not end quickly or advancing a large market team for the NBA's benefit. All seven games named had been officiated by Bavetta.

Overview Algebraic specification seeks to systematically develop more efficient programs by: # formally defining types of data, and mathematical operations on those data types # abstracting implementation details, such as the size of representations (in memory) and the efficiency of obtaining outcome of computations # formalizing the computations and operations on data types # allowing for automation by formally restricting operations to this limited set of behaviors and data types. An algebraic specification achieves these goals by defining one or more data types, and specifying a collection of functions that operate on those data types. These functions can be divided into two classes: # constructor functions: functions that create or initialize the data elements, or construct complex elements from simpler ones # additional functions: functions that operate on the data types, and are defined in terms of the constructor functions. Example Consider a formal algebraic specification for the boolean data type. One possible algebraic specification may provide two constructor functions for the data-element: a true constructor and a false constructor. Thus, a boolean data element could be declared, constructed, and initialized to a value. In this scenario, all other connective elements, such as XOR and AND, would be additional functions. Thus, a data element could be instantiated with either \\"true\\" or \\"false\\" value, and additional functions could be used to perform any operation on the data element. Alternatively, the entire system of boolean data types could be specified using a different set of constructor functions: a false constructor and a not constructor. In that case, an additional function could be defined to yield the value \\"true.\\" The algebraic specification therefore describes all possible states of the data element, and all possible transitions between states.

Constructed above the Park River Conduit, the highway underwent rehabilitation from 2004‚Äì2005. Route description I-91 for the Whitehead Highway It is signed as \\"Exit 29A ‚Äì Capitol Area\\" on I-91 and has the unsigned designation of State Road 598 (SR 598). There are two intermediate exits (at Columbus Boulevard and Prospect Street) from the highway before its western terminus at Pulaski Circle. History The highway opened in 1945 and was initially named for Henry F. Conland, publisher of the Hartford Courant and chair of a city bridge commission. That December, it was renamed after Ulmont I. \\"Monty\\" Whitehead, Jr., the first resident of Hartford to die in World War II. Whitehead, a 1933 graduate of Bulkeley High School in Hartford, graduated in 1940 from the U.S. Naval Academy, where he starred in football. On December 7, 1941, Whitehead was serving at Pearl Harbor on the battleship U.S.S. Arizona, which blew up and sank in the opening minutes of the Japanese attack, killing Whitehead and 1,176 other sailors. The name is frequently misspelled - even by the Connecticut Department of Transportation - as \\"Conlin Whitehead Highway\\". Whitehead Highway was originally to be part of Interstate 484, an auxiliary route of I-84. The highway was to be upgraded via straightening and bridge improvements and brought through a short tunnel under the state capitol to connect to I-84 at exit 48. This would have reduced the traffic load at the intersection of I-91 and I-84 in downtown Hartford. The extension, first proposed in 1968, was cancelled in 1983 due to local opposition. The route was never signed as I-484.

For the ceremonial water salute given to vehicles, including ships and airplanes, see Water salute. Wetting-down is a raucous ceremony for newly promoted officers observed in the U.S. and Royal navies, and the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Marines, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps, and U.S. Public Health Service officers also participate in this custom as homage to their naval heritage. Procedure The wetting-down celebration is always paid for and hosted by the newly promoted officer, who invites his or her friends, which usually include several officers of the same rank at which he or she has most recently served. It is customary for the officer to spend the difference between their pay at their old rank and their pay at the new rank on the bar tab for their guests. Normally the party occurs at a bar or pub frequented by officers. Being located in a bar, there is typically a great deal of drinking of alcohol. There must always be at least one ceremonial toast. Friends present several rowdy speeches expressing their appreciation of the new officer's good comradeship and endearing faults. Often one of the speeches describes an embarrassing event in the new officer's career which occurred under the old rank, although this latter variety of speech is sometimes discouraged in order to avoid providing evidence pertinent to a disciplinary hearing. Improvisations A wetting-down party is informal and improvisations on the ceremony are the rule, not the exception. The senior officer present may make the final speech, or if present, the commanding officer who made the promotion can make the final speech. Sometimes the final speech is presented by the new officer's father, especially if he has served in a navy. Although, for particularly exuberant wetting-down parties, parents and senior officers are not usually invited and the honor falls to one of the new officer's close friends. History The \\"wetting down\\" for such a party term comes from the historical practice of wetting new rank insignia to give it a more weathered appearance. In most navies, officers's rank insignia consists of gold braiding in the form of stripes on the cuff, epaulets, and (historically) arrangements of gold braid on buttonholes, collars, etc. Upon promotion, a newly added stripe or epaulet would stand out against the more weathered gold braiding already on the uniform. Newly promoted officers would literally soak the new gold braid (usually with either seawater or an alcoholic beverage) to make it appear older so that the promotion would not look as recent. Modern wetting down parties may or may not include some version of, or homage to, this ritual, such as pouring beer over the officer's head or forcing him to jump fully-uniformed into the ocean. In popular culture In an episode of the American TV series, Major Dad, 2nd Lt. \\"Gene\\" Holowachuk (Matt Mulhern) is promoted to 1st Lt. and is, therefore, obliged to throw his fellow officers a wetting-down ceremony. However, Holowachuk wants the ceremony to be alcohol- free since he does not drink liquor. The episode, titled, \\"Wetting-Down\\", originally aired on October 22, 1990. This ceremony was also shown in Star Trek Generations when Lt Worf was promoted to Lt Cmdr and dropped into the holographic ocean in the holodeck. In the ninth season opener of TV series NCIS, Probationary Officer Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) receives her ID badges and shield which means she is officially a special agent of NCIS. Ziva wants to go out and celebrate and McGee (Sean Harland Murray) implies she means a wetting-down, but Ziva thinks he is referring to a wedding because of the language barrier. Gibbs (Mark Harmon) corrects her and explains it means she is paying. The episode, titled, \\"Nature of the Beast\\", originally aired on September 20, 2011.

The organization is charged with quickly providing Army units deployed globally with innovative government off- the-shelf and commercially available solutions that address urgent requirements within 180 days or less. The REF is able to do this through unique authorities and by maintaining a presence near the point of need. REF personnel are positioned in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait and mobile laboratories are available for quick solutions. Additionally, the REF empowers the Army at a grassroots level, enabling individual soldiers to communicate needs directly through simple request forms. Along with leveraging existing technology to meet urgent needs of Army forces deployed globally, the REF also informs longer-term materiel development for the future force. In 2020, the Army announced it will dissolve the Asymmetric Warfare Group and the Rapid Equipping Force, by year-end FY2021 (30 Sep 2021).Patrick Tucker (2 Oct 2020) US Army To Dissolve Rapid Equipping Force, Asymmetric Warfare Group Mission The REF provides innovative materiel solutions to meet the urgent requirements of U.S. Army forces employed globally, informs materiel development for the future force, and on order expands to meet operational demands. Functions The REF lines of support fall into four distinct categories: assess, equip, insert, and inform. Its primary function is to equip units with technologies that fill identified capability gaps. The REF provides training on these technologies downrange and at home-stations. It can insert selected future force solutions for operational evaluation in addition to providing new capabilities not readily available in the existing Army inventory. Finally, the REF constantly identifies and assesses emerging technologies and Army practices concerning operational needs affecting force readiness. Organization overview The REF is structured to integrate three distinct functions to provide the Army with a responsive, rapid acquisition organization. First, the REF Director has the unique authority to validate requirements. Second, the REF has acquisition authority and provided by the United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology chartered Project Manager housed within REF‚Äôs chain of command. Finally, the REF receives funding from a variety of sources, allowing it the flexibility to support Soldiers deployed around the world. These three pillars of authority allow REF to quickly insert solutions into theater in weeks rather than years. REF aims to deliver items into Soldiers‚Äô hands within 90 days, and has even provided a solution in 72 hours after learning of an urgent need.Richard A. Cody, \\"Minutes and Hours‚Ä¶ Not Days and Weeks\\" ed. D. Bennett Dickson, 2008 The REF can receive requests for support from any soldier, from a private to the Chief of Staff of the Army. These requests are submitted via a simple document called a \\"10-Liner\\" that prompts soldiers to describe the capability gaps they are facing downrange or as they prepare to deploy. From that information, the REF team begins the analysis and procurement process in order to best equip the requesting unit. It is important to note that the REF equips specific units, not the entirety of the Army. If a solution is applicable to a larger portion of the Army, REF works with partner organizations to transition technologies to project managers who can then field the equipment to a larger portion of the Army. History The REF was created in 2002 after U.S. soldiers realized the need for non-standard equipment to meet the demands of new terrain, warfare tactics and their assigned missions. Since then, the REF has met challenges as diverse as enhancing soldier mobility, providing improved surveillance in austere locations, equipping operational energy sources and enhancing communications. The 2004 REF Charter and Implementation Guidance and Coordination memo, signed by Lieutenant General Richard A. Cody, formalized REF‚Äôs \\"equip,\\" \\"insert,\\" \\"assess\\" functions. The excerpt below outlines how each line of support would shape REF‚Äôs mission. \\"The REF will identify and evaluate emerging technologies, concepts, and surrogates to estimate/approximate threshold capabilities, while simultaneously providing operationally relevant capabilities to our combat forces within a time frame relevant to current operations‚Ä¶ It is my intent to insert critical future technologies and capabilities into the current force while continuously shaping the future force and accelerating its evolution. Therefore, I direct expansion of the mission of the REF to encompass two additional critical functions: :# First, the REF will analyze relevant technologies and capabilities that exist in the Army‚Äôs laboratory, developmental systems, other Services and Federal Agencies, and international sources, and when appropriate, bring these capabilities into an operational environment to examine and evaluate the concepts and their effectiveness. If suitable, the REF will assess the potential to accelerate fielding and the contribution such fielding would make to increased combat effectiveness. :# Second, REF initiatives will serve as the testbed to construct a model for lasting change and improvement of Army business practices and to better streamline Army Acquisition processes. Establish a continuous feedback process to provide lessons learned and best practices identified through the rapid equipping process to the relevant staff and US Army Major Command (MACOMs). The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE), with the support of the REF, will use REF initiatives to develop a process to transfer REF initiatives to a fast-tracked fielding program of selected systems. The Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller, in coordination with the Chief of Legislative Liaison and the REF, will develop a concept and Congressional strategy to support significant Army reprogramming actions and request modifications to laws as necessary to facilitate rapid acquisition when acceleration of future technologies contribute significant combat power to the force in the near term.\\"Department of the Army Memorandum, Signed by LTG Richard A. Cody \\"The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) Charter and Implementation Guidance Coordination,\\" 12 January 2004. In January 2014, the REF was deemed critical by the Army and transitioned to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Projects The REF mitigates capability gaps across the spectrum of warfighter function areas and has supported many projects as listed below. *PackBot: Remote-Controlled, full sensor package capable tracked vehicle *Magnetometer: Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) ultra-sensitive metal detecting wand *Wellcam: Complete man-portable video system to search wells *Armor Kit: 4-door vehicle protection kit equipped to units during Operation Iraqi Freedom *PILAR: Acoustically based, fully passive system that determines sniper fire direction on LCD screen *Talon Robot: A man-portable robot used for the disposal of IEDs and other dangerous explosives *Boomerang Counter- Fire Detection: A gunfire locator that uses microphone sensors to detect where shots originate *Minotaur: A robotic loader with front mine rollers to support dismounted operations *Raven: A hand-launched, remote controlled unmanned aerial vehicle for surveillance *Tactical Aerostats: Smaller aerostats used as ISR and communications platforms *Pole Cam: Extendable pole-mounted camera with a handheld receiver for situational awareness *Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS): System to monitor movement near remote FOBs and COPs *Man-Portable Line Charge (MPLC): Backpack-packaged clearing charge to disrupt IED trigger mechanisms The REF currently supports priority equipping efforts over a wide range of challenges including solutions for subterranean operations, electronic warfare, unmanned and counter-unmanned aerial systems, intelligence, and expeditionary force protection.

It was founded in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1891 by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri who worked at the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon. In 1970 BBC took over the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon. In 1988 it merged with ASEA to form ABB Group, a company producing DC Motors, AC motors, generators, turbines, transformers and the electrical equipment of locomotives. Some of BBC's technology went into German U-boats of World War II, such as the depth controls. Early History of BBC Brown Boveri BBC Brown Boveri was established in 1891. The company was one of only a few multinational corporations to operate subsidiaries that were larger than the parent company. Because of the limitations of the Swiss domestic market, Brown Boveri established subsidiaries throughout Europe relatively early in its history, and at times had difficulty maintaining managerial control over some of its larger operating units. The merger with ASEA, a company which was praised for its strong management, was expected to help Brown Boveri reorganize and reassert control over its vast international network. =Activity in Britain= Brown Boveri's early activities included manufacturing electrical components such as electric motors for locomotives and power-generating equipment for Europe's railway systems. In 1919 the company entered into a licensing agreement with the British manufacturing firm Vickers which gave the British firm the right to manufacture and sell Brown Boveri products throughout the British Empire and in some parts of Europe. The agreement gave Brown Boveri a significant amount of money and the promise of substantial annual revenue, and also helped the company expand into foreign markets at a time when protectionist policies inhibited international expansion. =Activity in Continental Europe= Letea BacƒÉu paper mill (1930) In the early 1920s, Brown Boveri, already a geographically diversified company with successful operating subsidiaries in Italy, Germany, Norway, Austria, and the Balkans, suffered losses due to the devaluation of the French franc and the German mark. At the same time, in the Swiss domestic market, production costs increased while sales remained static, causing the company further losses. In 1924 Brown Boveri devalued its capital by 30 percent to cover the losses it had incurred. In 1927 the agreement with Vickers ran out and was not renewed. Besides the arrangement Brown Boveri had had with this British firm, it also had a somewhat similar relationship with Netherlands-based which lasted well into the early 1960s when the Heemaf led the creation of Holec (Holland Electric).Jasper Faber. The Perils and Advantages of Licensing Technology in the Electrical Equipment Industry: Heemaf 1908-1970 http://www.gtg.tu.berlin.de/.../306-jasper-faber-the-perils-and-advantages... =Growth= During the same time, Brown Boveri's various subsidiaries grew rapidly. Industrialization throughout Europe created strong demand for the company's heavy electrical equipment. Italy's burgeoning railroad industry provided a particularly strong boost to Brown Boveri's Italian subsidiary, and the company's German facility actually did considerably more business than the Swiss parent. For the next few decades Brown Boveri grew as fast as technological developments in electrical engineering. Each of the company's subsidiaries tended to develop individually, as if it were a domestic company in the country in which it operated, and broad geographic coverage helped insulate the parent from severe crises when a certain region experienced economic difficulties. =After World War II= After World War II, the Cold War presented a variety of business opportunities for defense-related electrical contractors, but Brown Boveri's subsidiaries were seen as foreign companies in many of the countries in which they operated, sometimes making it difficult for the company to win lucrative contracts involving sensitive technology and other government contracts. The company, nevertheless, excelled at power generation, including nuclear power generators, and prospered in this field. Electrification in the Third World also provided Brown Boveri with substantial profits. Reorganization of Brown Boveri in 1970 In 1970 Brown Boveri began an extensive reorganization. The company's subsidiaries were divided into five groups: German, French, Swiss, \\"medium-sized\\" (seven manufacturing bases in Europe and Latin America), and Brown Boveri International (the remaining facilities). Each of these groups was further broken down into five product divisions: power generation, electronics, power distribution, traction equipment, and industrial equipment. =The United States= Throughout the 1970s, Brown Boveri struggled to expand into the US market. The company negotiated a joint venture with Rockwell, the American manufacturer of high-tech military and aerospace applications, but the deal fell through when the two companies could not agree on financial terms. While Brown Boveri counted a handful of major U.S. customers as its clients, among them large utilities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and American Electric Power's Nuclear Plant in south west Michigan DC Cook Unit 2 steam turbine, Brown Boveri's American market share was low considering the company's international standing (North American sales accounted for only 3.5 percent of total sales in 1974 and 1975), and the company continued to search for a means of effectively entering U.S. markets. =Great Britain= During the electrification of the British West Coast Main Line in the early 1970s, Brown Boveri traction insulators were used. In 1974 Brown Boveri acquired the British controls and instrument manufacturer, George Kent Group. The deal at first raised concern in Britain over foreign ownership of such highly sensitive technology, but Brown Boveri prevailed with the encouragement of George Kent's rank-and-file employees, who feared the alternative of being bought by Britain's General Electric Company (GEC). The newly acquired company was renamed Brown Boveri Kent. =The Middle East and Africa= In the mid-1970s growing demand in the Middle East for large power-generating facilities distracted the company from its push into North America. Oil-rich African nations, like Nigeria, attempting to diversify their manufacturing capabilities also created new markets for Brown Boveri's heavy electrical engineering expertise. The 1980s In the early 1980s Brown Boveri's sales flattened out and the company's earnings declined. In 1983 Brown Boveri's German subsidiary in Mannheim, West Germany, which accounted for nearly half of the entire parent company's sales, rebounded. In spite of an increase in orders, the company's cost structure kept earnings down. In 1985 the subsidiary's performance improved as a result of cost-cutting measures but price decreases in the international market and unfavorable shifts in currency exchanges rates largely offset these gains. In 1986 the parent company acquired a significant block of shares in the Mannheim subsidiary, bringing its total stake to 75 percent. =Unification of research= In the later 1980s Brown Boveri took steps to reduce duplication of research and development among its various groups. While each subsidiary continued to do some product-development research for its individual market, theoretical research was unified under the parent company, making more efficient use of research funding. =Supercharger development= In 1987 the company introduced a supercharging system for diesel engines called Comprex. This system was capable of increasing an engine's horsepower by 35 percent and delivering up to 50 percent more torque at lower speeds. The Japanese automaker Mazda planned to use the new supercharger in its new diesel passenger models. =Merger= In 1988, Brown Boveri merged with the Swedish company ASEA to form Asea Brown Boveri (ABB Group).

The story revolves around the lives of two sisters who are very close, but as different as night and day. When one of them falls victim to a deadly disease sweeping the kingdom, the other must find her inner strength and bravery to discover the cure, and save her elder sister. Plot Princess Addie is fearful and shy. Princess Meryl is bold and brave. They are sisters, and they mean the world to each other. Bamarre is plagued by a fatal disease called the Gray Death, which has three stages: Weakness, Sleep, and then Fever. While the weakness may last for hours to weeks, the sleep always lasts nine days, and the fever always lasts three. Bamarre also has specters, which lure travelers to their deaths unless exposed, sorcerers, ogres, dwarves, elves, gryphons, dragons, and fairies. Fairies, however, have not been seen since Drualt, Bamarre's greatest hero and subject of myths, went up to visit them after the tragic death of his sweetheart Freya. The two princesses strike up a friendship with Rhys, the apprentice sorcerer helping their father. Soon after, Meryl is suddenly struck ill with the Gray Death. Addie has trouble coming to terms with the fact that Meryl is going to die, while Meryl tries in vain to prove Addie's theory that the Gray Death might be cured if the person who is ill refuses to be sick, running when weak, staying awake when tired, etc. Since a prophecy from a long ago specter states that :The Gray Death will be cured :When cowards find courage :And rain falls over all Bamarre When King Lionel returns just as cowardly as before, Addie sets out to find the cure herself. Using a pair of seven-league boots and a magical spyglass from her deceased mother, a copy of Drualt, an invisibility cloak a magic tablecloth from Rhys, some of Milton's herbs and Meryl's sword, Addie successfully travels to the Mulee forest to find a specter, only to be tricked by one that took the form of Rhys. The real Rhys makes her realize the truth, and she learns from the specter that a dragon would be her best bet for finding the cure. Rhys has to leave for the Sorcerers' Citadel, but not before Addie realizes that there's more behind their friendship. After accidentally overcoming a pack of gryphons with her tablecloth, Addie is found by the dragon Vollys and taken to her lair. Although dragons are solitary creatures, they are also lonely, so Addie is forced to entertain Vollys to avoid a fiery demise in Vollys' stomach. She does this through her embroidery, which is her sole bold attribute. Although Addie is terrified of the dragon, she learns that Vollys is always sad when she eats her \\"guests\\" after they have angered her one time too many. Addie also learns the dragon version of Drualt's story, which portrays the hero as a villain who mercilessly kills noble dragons, including Vollys' mother. Vollys also tells Addie that the Gray Death came from her mother's corpse, a revenge for her death. Because she does not think Addie can escape, Vollys also tells Addie that the Gray Death can be cured by the water of a waterfall that flows from Mount Ziriat, the fairies' invisible mountain. She even tells Addie where the mountain is. Meanwhile, Addie learns through her spyglass that Meryl has entered the sleeping stage of the Gray Death, and later fever stage of the Gray Death. Addie manages to escape Vollys with her boots, and returns to the castle. After reuniting with Rhys, Meryl tells Addie that she has until the next dawn to live. Addie tells them about the cure, and she and Rhys uses the seven-league boots to carry Meryl to the mountain. They end up outside the same village that refused to help Drualt's sweetheart due to their cowardice. Upon questioning, the isolated villagers say that although they have heard of the Gray Death, no one in the village has ever had it. The three also learn that all the villagers drink from a waterfall that comes from a mountain so tall and shrouded in mist that no one has ever seen it. Realizing that they are talking about Mount Ziriat, and the villagers are never sick because they drink the water, Rhys and the Princesses manage to find a few villagers courageous enough and willing to show them the waterfall, which is a few hours away, despite the dark night and the threat of ogres and gryphons. While they walk, Rhys confesses his love to Addie, and she does the same. Just as they reach the waterfall, though, the party is attacked by ogres, gryphons and an enraged Vollys. The sky begins to lighten, and Addie tells Meryl, who is having the time of her life in battle, to run to the water and drink. While she is running, though, Addie is caught by an ogre unexpectedly and screams in pain. Meryl runs back to rescue her when the first rays of sunlight come, just as rain begins to fall. Addie is knocked unconscious, Meryl falls to the ground, and wholes of light fly down. When Addie wakes up, she learns from Meryl, who seems different somehow, that they were rescued by fairies and taken to the top of Mount Ziriat. The rain had fallen everywhere, curing all with the Gray Death except those who were too close to death to save. When Addie gained the courage to save her sister, and when the cowardly villagers redeemed themselves by helping Meryl and Addie, the fairies made water from their enchanted waterfall rain over all Bamarre. Meryl also tells Addie that she, too, was one of those on the brink of death when the rain came, so the fairies could not truly save her. However, they offered to transform her into a fairy and join them in an endless battle against fearsome, monstrous creatures, the outcome of which affects the world below. Meryl accepted the offer, and is now a fairy, unable to return with Addie. Addie also learns from Meryl that she is now with Drualt, who was also transformed after leaving Bamarre, and that he had been the presence Addie felt in her darkest hours, cheering her up and giving her the strength to go on. Rhys and Addie marry and live happily ever after, with Meryl as Fairy Godmother to their children and grandchildren, the first after hundreds of years. The book concludes with a Drault-like tale, recounting the adventures of the two Princesses of Bamarre.  Themes  Various themes can be found throughout the text of The Two Princesses of Bamarre. Two major themes that are bounced between are courage and fear. Or rather, courage in the face of fear. With the fearful protagonist Princess Addie, we see a weak character who has no desire to leave her comfort zone and face difficult tasks. Princess Addie hides in the shadow of her brave and adventure-seeking sister Meryl. When Meryl becomes sick with the Gray Death, we see Princess Addie emerge from her cocoon. When Princess Addie‚Äôs love for her sister overpowers her fear, we see that courage is found in selflessness. As Princess Addie holds to her love for her sister, she discovers a strength and bravery that didn‚Äôt exist before. This calls to attention yet another theme of unconditional love. Despite Princess Addie‚Äôs fear, her love for her sister causes her to breach barriers within herself. As she participates in her quest, she frequently uses her magic spyglass to check up on her sister, constantly in a state of worry and compassion for Meryl. Each time Princess Addie glimpses her elder sister, her overwhelming sisterly love helps propel her towards her goal.

History  Class 111 is the successor of the Class 110 express Einheitslokomotive. Since demand for fast electric locomotives was high even after production of the 110 ended, the Deutsche Bundesbahn decided to commission a new batch in the 1970s. The bogies were replaced with a different type, significantly improving the locomotive's behaviour at higher speeds. The driver's cab also was significantly improved by the DB-Einheitsf√ºhrerstand (jointly developed by the Bundesbahn-Zentralamt M√ºnchen and Krauss-Maffei and designed under ergonomic aspects) that was first used for Class 111 locos and whose basic layout nowadays still forms part of the cab design found in many of DB's locomotives and control cars. For the first time, a digital cab car interface in addition to the then-standard conventional interface was used in new Deutsche Bundesbahn locomotives. The first locomotive, 111 001, left the Krauss-Maffei workshop in December 1974. Up to 1984, 226 more engines were produced, not only at Krauss-Maffei but also including parts from Henschel, Krupp, Siemens, AEG and BBC. 111 227 originally was supposed to be the last newly built conventional AC locomotive of the Bundesbahn, as the Baureihe 120, using three-phase AC motors, was already being produced.). However, after the German reunification it was decided to commission another batch of the Class 112, which had been developed by the East German railways. This decision was made mainly for political purposes. In 1979 it was decided to use the Class 111 for the S-Bahn trains of the Rhein- Ruhr S-Bahn. Hence, the engines 111 111 to 111 188 were delivered in S-Bahn colours and equipped with S-Bahn gear (destination displays, e.g.). In the same year, the Intercity was reformed under the InterCity '79 scheme and the network was enlarged. As it was foreseeable that the Class 103 engines would be stressed with that workload, the 111's licence was extended to a speed of , and from May 1980 onwards, the units could be found doing InterCity services.  Accidents  * 111 109 was involved in an accident in the station of Wels, Austria, crashing with the √ñBB 1042 560.

Plot introduction This historical novel is about a Livonian nobleman, Timotheus von Bock, who has married a peasant girl named Eeva to prove everyone that good men are equal before nature, God and ideals. Eeva's brother Jakob analyses von Bock's life throughout his journal and tries to figure out if the nobleman is truly mad as everyone seems to believe. The Czar's Madman is arguably one of the best-known Estonian novels in the world. =Title= The \\"Czar's Madman\\" is a reference to the main character who has been imprisoned for being so bold as to talk frankly to the Czar. This is enough to bring accusations of 'insanity'. Plot summary The story is written in diary form, describing the impact of revolutionary thinking on the part of a family member. Aristocrat Timotheus von Bock (the diarist's brother in law) writes a letter to the Czar criticising the way in which the Czar's family runs the country. He justifies this act by an oath made to the Czar to give an honest appraisal of the situation. Von Bock is imprisoned as a traitor (although the reason for his imprisonment is kept secret, as is the letter) for 9 years before being released into house arrest on the basis that he is 'mad'.

The daughter of a clergyman, Vanbrugh followed her elder sister Violet into the theatrical profession and sustained a career for more than 50 years. In her early days as a leading lady she was particularly associated with the plays of Arthur Wing Pinero and later had parts written for her by J. M. Barrie, Bernard Shaw, Somerset Maugham, A. A. Milne and No√´l Coward. More famous for comic rather than dramatic roles, Vanbrugh nevertheless played a number of the latter in both modern works and the classics. Her stage debut was in Shakespeare, but she seldom acted in his works later in her career; exceptions were her Queen Gertrude in Hamlet in 1931 and her Meg Page in The Merry Wives of Windsor, opposite her sister Violet as Alice Ford, in 1937. Vanbrugh appeared frequently in fundraising shows for various charities. She was active over many years in the support of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, of which her brother was principal. After her death the Academy's new theatre was named The Vanbrugh Theatre in honour of her and her sister. Biography =Early years= Vanbrugh was born Irene Barnes in Exeter, the youngest daughter and fifth child of six of the Rev. Reginald Henry Barnes (1831‚Äì1889), Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral and Vicar of Heavitree, and his wife, Frances Mary Emily, n√©e Nation.Littlewood, S. R., \\"Vanbrugh, Dame Irene (1872‚Äì1949)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 7 January 2011 Irene's eldest sister Violet and younger brother Kenneth were also to make theatrical careers. Another sister Edith married an official in the colonial service and became a pillar of the British Raj, and Angela was a professional violinist.\\"Portraits\\", The Theatre, August 1897, p.95 Irene was educated at Exeter High School and at schools in Paris. When the Barnes family moved to London, she attended a school near Earls Court recommended by the actress Ellen Terry, a family friend. It was also at Terry's suggestion that Violet, on starting a theatrical career, had adopted the stage name Vanbrugh. Irene did the same. Violet's early success encouraged Irene to follow her into the theatrical profession. Sir John Gielgud described the two: > The Vanbrugh sisters were remarkably alike in appearance. Tall and imposing, > beautifully spoken, they moved with grace ... They were elegantly but never > ostentatiously dressed, entering and leaving the stage with unerring > authority ... Violet never struck me as a natural comedienne, as Irene > was.Gielgud, p. 115 As her elder sister had done, Irene enrolled at Sarah Thorne's school of acting, based at Margate, which gave her a thorough practical grounding. She recalled, \\"We played every kind of play there; comedy, farce, and drama of the deepest dye; while at Christmas there came the pantomime, so that the Juliet of a week ago might be the Prince Paragon of the Yule-tide extravaganza.\\"Bacchus, Reginald, \\"Miss Irene Vanbrugh: Her Art and Herself,\\" The Ludgate, October 1899, p. 501 As a student at the school, her first appearance on stage was in August 1888, as the capricious shepherdess Phoebe in As You Like It at the Theatre Royal, Margate, opposite the Rosalind of her sister Violet.\\"Dame Irene Vanbrugh\\", The Times, 1 December 1949, p. 7 =Early roles= Allan Aynesworth, Evelyn Millard, Vanbrugh and George Alexander in the 1895 London premiere of The Importance of Being Earnest Lewis Carroll, a college friend of Vanbrugh's father, saw her performing in Margate, and was impressed. On his recommendation she made her London d√©but in December 1888, playing the White Queen and the Knave of Hearts in a revival of Alice in Wonderland at the old Globe Theatre. Another Barnes sister, Edith, joined her in this production.\\"Chips\\", The North-Eastern Daily Gazette, 4 December 1888, unnumbered page Violet's early theatrical engagements had been with J. L. Toole, and Irene emulated her and joined his company. For Toole, she played in established comedy successes including Dion Boucicault's Dot and H. J. Byron's Uncle Dick's Darling. The Gay Lord Quex When Toole toured Australia in 1890, Vanbrugh was a member of his company, acting in every play in its repertoire. She later commented, \\"I think this was even better training than Miss Thorne's school; not only was I constantly playing a new part, but I was constantly playing to a different type of audience. We visited all sorts of Australian cities, large and small, and one was pretty certain before long to find out the weak points in one's method.\\" On her return, she remained with Toole's company, and played her first original roles as Thea Tesman in James Barrie's, burlesque Ibsen's Ghost (1891), and as Bell Golightly in Barrie's Walker, London (1892). In 1893, Vanbrugh joined Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre as Lettice in The Tempter (1893) by Henry Arthur Jones. The play was not popular and was soon taken off, but she had more success in Jones's next play, The Masqueraders, and in 1894 she was engaged by George Alexander at the St James's Theatre where she played a number of secondary parts, and in 1895 created the role of Gwendolen Fairfax in The Importance of Being Earnest. When Arthur Bourchier, who had married Violet Vanbrugh, launched himself as an actor-manager, Vanbrugh joined them at the Royalty Theatre, winning good notices in The Chili Widow and in the title role of the comedy Kitty Clive. She went with the Bourchier company to America, and on her return in 1898 she created Rose in Trelawny of the Wells by Arthur Pinero, and, during the same season, Stella in Robert Marshall's His Excellency the Governor. After a short break she then played the role that made her name, Sophy Fullgarney in Pinero's The Gay Lord Quex (1899). This part, a little Cockney manicurist, was quite different from any she had played before, but Pinero was insistent that she should play it. In the words of the biographer S. R. Littlewood, \\"Vanbrugh's intelligence, sympathy, and alertness avoided extravagance in a subtle expression of class-contrast. This gave the character an intensity of appeal that was at the time something quite new.\\" The play was regarded as risqu√©, and one critic commented that had Lewis Carroll still been alive, he would have approved of \\"Miss Vanbrugh's greatest triumph,\\" but probably not of the play. =Early twentieth century= Vanbrugh in 1910 In 1901 Vanbrugh married the actor Dion Boucicault Jr., son of his more famous namesake. They frequently appeared together for the rest of his life, and he became her manager in 1915. There were no children of the marriage. Between the turn of the century and World War I she had leading roles in new plays by J. M. Barrie (The Admirable Crichton, 1902;\\"Duke of York's Theatre\\", The Times, 5 November 1902, p. 10 and Rosalind, 1912),\\"Duke of York's Theatre ‚Äì The Triple Bill\\", The Times, 15 October 1912, p. 8 Pinero (Letty, 1903;\\"Duke of York's Theatre\\", The Times, 9 October 1903, p. 4 His House in Order, 1906;\\"St. James's Theatre ‚Äì 'His House in Order'\\", The Times, 2 February 1906, p. 4 and Mid-Channel, 1909),\\"St. James's Theatre ‚Äì \\"Mid-Channel'\\", The Times, 3 September 1909, p. 8 and Maugham (Grace, 1910;\\"Duke of York's Theatre ‚Äì 'Grace'\\", The Times, 17 October 1910, p. 7 and The Land of Promise, 1914).\\"'The Land of Promise' ‚Äì Mr. Maugham's Play at The Duke of York's\\", The Times, 27 February 1914, p. 10 She also starred in new plays by Charles Haddon Chambers (Passers-By, 1911),\\"Wyndham's Theatre ‚Äì \\"Passers-By'\\", The Times, 30 March 1911, p. 10 and A. E. W. Mason (Open Windows, 1913).\\"St. James's Theatre ‚Äì 'Open Windows'\\", The Times, 12 March 1913, p. 10 In 1913 she played Lady Gay Spanker in a revival of Boucicault senior's London Assurance in an all-star cast including Tree, Charles Hawtrey, Bourchier, Weedon Grossmith and Marie Tempest. This was one of the many charity fund-raising productions in which Vanbrugh appeared throughout her career.\\"'London Assurance' ‚Äì Royal Visit To St. James's Theatre\\", The Times, 28 June 1913, p. 10 During World War I, Vanbrugh took a succession of leading roles in the West End, beginning with The Spirit of Culture in Barrie's war play Der Tag (1914).\\"'Der Tag' ‚Äì Sir James Barrie's War Play\\", The Times, 22 December 1914, p. 11 Following this, she played Lady Falkland in The Right to Kill (1915); the title role in Caroline (1916); Mrs Lytton in The Riddle (1916); Emily Ladew in Her Husband's Wife (1916); Leonora in Barrie's Seven Women (1917); and the title role in A.

Her younger brother, Kenneth Barnes, had been its principal since 1909. In 1919, to raise funds for the Academy's theatre, then under construction, she had the play Masks and Faces filmed with a star cast, including not only leading actors but the playwrights Shaw, Pinero and Barrie in cameo appearances. Dion Boucicault Jr. and Irene Vanbrugh in A. A. Milne's Mr. Pim Passes By Vanbrugh's first big stage success of the post-war years was in Milne's Mr Pim Passes By in 1920. She and her husband opened it in Manchester, and such was its reception that they brought it into the West End. From 1927 to 1929, she toured Australia and New Zealand, playing a variety of parts. Her other appearances in the inter-war years included Gertrude to Henry Ainley's Hamlet in 1931, Millicent Jordan in Dinner at Eight (1933), the Duchess of Marlborough in Viceroy Sarah, (1935) and Mistress Page in The Merry Wives of Windsor with her sister Violet as Mistress Ford (1937).\\"Blackfriars Ring ‚Äì 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'\\", The Times, 15 March 1937, p. 12 In 1939, she created the role of Catherine of Braganza in Shaw's In Good King Charles's Golden Days. Vanbrugh appeared in ten talkies from 1933 to 1945: Head of the Family; Catherine the Great; Girls Will Be Boys; The Way of Youth; Youthful Folly; Escape Me Never; Wings of the Morning; Knight Without Armour; It Happened One Sunday; and I Live in Grosvenor Square. In 1938, during the run of No√´l Coward's Operette, in which she played Lady Messiter, Vanbrugh celebrated her golden jubilee as an actress. It was celebrated at a gala charity matin√©e attended by the Queen at His Majesty's Theatre; Violet Vanbrugh, Coward, Edith Evans, Gladys Cooper, Seymour Hicks and many other leading performers took part.\\"Jubilee of Irene Vanbrugh ‚Äì The Queen at a Matin√©e\\", The Times, 21 June 1938, p. 14 =Later years= During the Battle of Britain the Vanbrugh sisters carried out what Littlewood calls \\"a characteristic piece of war work\\" by giving, with Donald Wolfit, lunchtime performances of extracts from The Merry Wives of Windsor at the Strand Theatre. Throughout the war, Vanbrugh appeared in the West End and on tour in new plays, revivals of her earlier successes, and classics. Almost fifty years after her first appearance in a Wilde play, she played Lady Markby in An Ideal Husband in 1943‚Äì44, giving a performance characterised by The Times as \\"comic perfection\\".\\"Westminster Theatre ‚Äì 'An Ideal Husband'\\", The Times, Wednesday, 17 November 1943, p. 6 Vanbrugh appeared as Mrs. Mildred Catchpole in the 1945 film I Live in Grosvenor Square, a British World War II romance directed and produced by Herbert Wilcox. Her co-stars were Dean Jagger and Rex Harrison. Vanbrugh was working to the end of her life. In November 1949 she appeared in Mary Bonaventure in its pre-London run in Birmingham, but she was taken ill before the London opening and died within days, several days before her 77th birthday. =Honours and commemorations= Vanbrugh was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1941.

It is famous for its tholos or \\"beehive\\" tomb, excavated in 1889 by Christos Tsountas. This consists of a walled approach, about 97 feet long, leading to a vaulted chamber some 33 feet in diameter, in the floor of which the actual grave was cut. Archaeological recovery The objects found there and transferred to the National Archaeological Museum of Athens include a large number of gems and amethyst beads, together with articles in gold, silver, bronze, iron, lead, amber and crystal. Many of the seals and rings found in the tholos have such strong affinities in style and subject matter with contemporary Cretan glyptic art that J. T. Hooker found it impossible to determine whether they were locally made or imported from Crete. By far the finest of the grave goods are a pair of golden cups decorated with scenes in relief, picturing the netting of wild bulls on one and their domestication (perhaps for the bull-leaping activities practised in Crete) on the other. The so-called \\"Violent Cup\\", showing netting of bulls, bears a remarkable resemblance to the description of the beginning of the ritual of consecration for the laws of Atlantis described in Plato's dialogue Critias.Plato, Critias, section 119e These form perhaps the most perfect works of Mycenaean-Minoan art which have survived. Of them Sir Kenneth Clark observed that even on such evolved works \\"the men are insignificant compared to the stupendous bulls\\". It seems likely that these Vaphio cups do not represent a local art but were imported from Crete, which at that early period was far ahead of mainland Greece in artistic development. note 44, finds them \\"well within the tradition of Cretan art\\", and adduces a bull scene from Katsambas (ILN, 14 August 1965) As further support for the connection to Crete, C. Michael Hogan notes that a charging bull painting is evocative of an image extant at the Palace of Knossos on Crete. However, Ellen Davis has strongly suggested that at least one of the cups was produced in Mainland Greece. Davis illustrates both the compositional and stylistic differences between the cups, demonstrating that one appears to be Minoan and the other Mycenaean. The tomb, which probably belonged to the territory of Amyclae rather than to Pharis, as is commonly stated, is now almost entirely destroyed.

Choukri was born in 1935, in Ayt Chiker (Ayt Chiker, hence his adopted family name: Choukri / Chikri), a small village in the Rif mountains, in the Nador province, Morocco. He was raised in a very poor family. He ran away from his tyrannical father and became a homeless child living in the poor neighborhoods of Tangier, surrounded by misery, prostitution, violence and drug abuse. At the age of 20, he decided to learn how to read and write and became later a schoolteacher. His family name \\"Choukri\\" is connected to the name Ayt Chiker which is the Berber tribe cluster he belonged to before fleeing hunger to Tangier. It is most likely that he adopted this name later in Tangier, because in the rural Rif family names were rarely registered. In the 1960s, in the cosmopolitan Tangier, he met Paul Bowles, Jean Genet and Tennessee Williams. Choukri's first writing was published in Al-adab (monthly review of Beirut) in 1966,\\"Moroccan writer Mohamed Choukri's rise from poverty to universal recognition\\", Magharebia, October 2, 2005. a story entitled \\"Al-Unf ala al- shati\\" (\\"Violence on the Beach\\"). International success came with the English translation of Al-khoubz Al-Hafi (For Bread Alone, Telegram Books) by Paul Bowles in 1973. The book was translated to French by Tahar Ben Jelloun in 1980 (√âditions Maspero), published in Arabic in 1982 and censored in Morocco from 1983 to 2000. The book would later be translated into 30 other languages. His main works are his autobiographic trilogy, beginning with For Bread Alone, followed by Zaman Al-Akhta√¢ aw Al-Shouttar (Time of Mistakes or Streetwise, Telegram Books) and finally Faces. He also wrote collections of short stories in the 1960s/1970s (Majnoun Al-Ward, The Flower Freak, 1980; Al-Khaima, The Tent, 1985). Likewise, he is known for his accounts of his encounters with the writers Paul Bowles, Jean Genet and Tennessee Williams (Jean Genet and Tennessee Williams in Tangier, 1992, Jean Genet in Tangier, 1993, Jean Genet, Suite and End, 1996, Paul Bowles: Le Reclus de Tanger, 1997). See also In Tangier, Telegram Books, 2008, for all three in one volume. Mohamed Choukri died of cancer on November 15, 2003, at the military hospital of Rabat. He was buried on November 17 at the Marshan cemetery in Tangier, with the audience of the Minister of Culture, numerous government officials, personalities and the spokesman of the King of Morocco. Before he died, Choukri created a foundation, Mohamed Choukri (president, Mohamed Acha√¢ri), owning his copyrights, his manuscripts and personal writings. Prior to his death he provided for his servant of almost 22 years. Early years Mohamed Choukri was born in the Rif more precisely Had, Bni Chiker during a famine, in a poor family with many children and a violent father. His mother tongue was the Riffian (an Amazigh dialect). Because of poverty, his family migrated to T√©touan and then to Tangier. As a child Choukri survived thanks to a variety of jobs, serving in a French family in the Algerian Rif, or guiding sailors who arrived in Tangier, where he learned Spanish. His life was surrounded by prostitutes, thieves, smugglers and especially a tyrannic and violent father. Choukri accused him of murdering his young brother, Kader, as well as his wife. After a family dispute, he left his family at the age of 11 to live in Tangier. There, he was a homeless child, a petty burglar, an occasional smuggler and a prostitute. At the age of 20, he met someone who changed his life. Learning how to read and write He met someone who helped him learn how to read and write Standard Arabic, a strange language for him, and different from Moroccan vernacular Arabic and Berber which he spoke. He decided to leave Tangier in 1956 (year of the independence of Morocco) and went to Larache, entering a primary school at the age of 21. He entered the Ecole Normale and became a schoolteacher. Back in Tangier in the 1960s, he continued to go to bars and brothels and began to write his personal story in Arabic with explicitness and detail. His explicitness about some of his sexually tinted experiences was largely condemned by religious and conservative forces in Morocco and abroad. Choukri grew to literary fame through his daring writings and his association with American writer and composer Paul Bowles, who lived in Tangier for decades. Bowles and Choukri worked together on the translation of For Bread Alone in 1973, and Bowles arranged for the novel to be published in England by Peter Owen. Censorship of For Bread Alone For Bread Alone became an international success when published in English, but the book also caused a furor in the Arab world. When the Arabic edition emerged, it was prohibited in Morocco, on the authority of the Interior Minister, Driss Basri, following the advice of the religious authorities. It was said to have offended by its references to teenage sexual experiences and drug abuse. This censorship ended in 2000, and For Bread Alone was finally published in Morocco. In 1999, For Bread Alone was removed from the syllabus of a modern Arabic Literature course at the American University in Cairo taught by Dr. Samia Mehrez due to some sexually explicit passages, prompting some observers to criticize the \\"ban\\" and blame government censorship. The incident was preceded by the removal by order of the President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak of Maxime Rodinson's book Muhammad, the banning of that book and the instructor of that course was not rehired. While some blamed \\"intimidation from Islamist militants, which the government does little to prevent,\\" in fact, the Egyptian government engaged in book banning in that period on a wide scale. Dr. Mehrez was threatened with sexual harassment proceedings and expulsion, the book \\"For Bread Alone\\" was examined by parliament, and the academic and literary community largely supported her use of the novel through a letter-writing campaign. Later life Mohamed Choukri believed he had secured that which was most important to him: a posthumous home for his literary work. His last will and testament, in which he left his entire estate to a foundation that was to be run jointly by five presidents: \\"After Choukri's death, this document disappeared without a trace,\\" says Roberto de Hollanda, who was the author's literary agent for many years. Securing his literary legacy was of the utmost importance to Choukri, but the promises that were made to him were not kept: \\"The decision was whether to give it to a European or an American university or whether to entrust it to a Moroccan institution,\\" the literary agent explains. Mohamed Choukri chose the Moroccan option. For one thing, he was afraid that the government might stop funding his expensive cancer treatment if he gave away the rights to his work to a foreign entity. On the other hand, it would also have been particularly shameful to have given them to one of the countries that had formerly colonized and oppressed Morocco. Films Ali Zaoua: Princes of the streets, a film by Nabil Ayouch, telling the story of a homeless child, is an adaptation of For Bread Alone, despite a less shocking atmosphere. For Bread Alone was adapted to cinema by Rachid Benhadj, in an Italian-French-Algerian production in 2004. It starred Said Taghmaoui among others. The film premiered at the first edition of the Festival of Casablanca in 2005.

He was a member of the iconic proto-punk rock band The Stooges, notably on the influential album Raw Power and in the reformed Stooges from 2009 to 2016. Between his stints in music, Williamson worked in Silicon Valley developing computer chips. Most recently he has continued as a solo artist. Early years Williamson was born in Castroville, Texas in 1949. His father died while he was young and he moved to San Antonio, Texas around the age of five. He began playing guitar in the 7th grade, while his family were living in Lawton, Oklahoma: When Williamson was in the ninth grade in Detroit, he formed his first rock band, The Chosen Few, with schoolmate Scott Richardson. They performed cover versions of Rolling Stones songs and others. Ron Asheton would go on to become the bassist in one of The Chosen Few's later line-ups. Despite this connection, the two were barely acquainted at the time, with Asheton recalling that \\"the first time I played with them, that was the last time James played with them. They met for the first time during a holiday break when Williamson attended a Frat Party Gig where Asheton was playing ... Iggy was also there that night and so Williamson met both people that night and remained in touch afterward.\\" As a guitarist, Asheton went on to form The Stooges with his brother Scott (drums), bassist Dave Alexander and Iggy Pop. Williamson also spent some time in a juvenile home after his stepfather had told him to cut his hair and Williamson refused. In the first half of 1966, Williamson was sent to a boarding school in a small town eighty miles north of New York City. While there, Williamson helped form and played lead guitar in the Coba Seas. During that time, the Coba Seas taped a rehearsal session, resulting in the first recordings of Williamson. After graduating from high school in 1969, Williamson travelled to New York to keep in touch with The Stooges, who were recording their debut album with former Velvet Underground multi- instrumentalist John Cale. The Stooges By late 1970, Williamson was invited to join The Stooges as a second guitarist. He performed his first gig with the band on December 5, 1970. The band were by then struggling with drug problems and a lack of commercial success; despite the injection of Williamson's musicianship, The Stooges couldn't overcome their difficulties. According to Williamson, \\"I got hepatitis and moved back to Detroit and basically the band completely dissolved.\\" Many of the demo recordings made during this period were belatedly issued as vinyl singles or EPs, including the proto-punk tracks \\"I Got A Right\\" and \\"Gimme Some Skin\\". In 1972, David Bowie offered Pop a chance to record in London; Pop promptly enlisted Williamson as a collaborator for the project.Gimme Danger documentary Having failed to find other suitable musicians during an intensive search, they eventually invited the Asheton brothers to join them and reformed The StoogesGimme Danger documentary, with the elder Asheton reluctantly moving from guitar to bass. Ron Asheton would harbor a longstanding animus toward Williamson for several decades. In a 1997 interview with Perfect Sound Forever, he reflected upon his relationship with Williamson at length, alleging that \\"James was into bad stuff. He wasn't into junk at that time but he fell right in line with THE EVIL PROGRAM. He was supposed to be a helper for me but he totally usurped my position and eventually, kicked me out from playing guitar.\\" Despite these tensions, Williamson co-wrote all the songs with Pop and played all the guitar parts on the ensuing album, Raw Power (1973). He played louder and raunchier than almost anybody at the time, with a jagged high-energy approach. According to Williamson, \\"I was a very emotional guitar player, so I always played that way. That's how we felt, so that was what it sounded like.\\" Asheton was less sanguine, noting that \\"James always loved Keith Richards and he even emulated him in his personal style and appearance. [Pop] finally got his Jagger-Richards. So he and Iggy were the songwriters. They wouldn't let me do nothing even though I would come up with pieces. Jim would actually almost go for something. Little suggestions I made for the tunes, little twists. Not that I did any major structural changes. But I did do pieces to enhance and I was never recognized for it or even a fuckin' 'thank you.'\\" Nevertheless, Williamson's aggressive guitar playing on Raw Power has often been cited as a major influence on the emerging punk scene in the mid-seventies. Johnny Marr (The Smiths, Modest Mouse) has also lauded Williamson's abilities: \\"I'm his biggest fan. He has the technical ability of Jimmy Page without being as studious, and the swagger of Keith Richards without being sloppy. He's both demonic and intellectual, almost how you would imagine Darth Vader to sound if he was in a band.\\" Under new management from Jeff Wald (the husband and manager of pop singer Helen Reddy), The Stooges began a highly chaotic tour in February 1973 with little support from Columbia Records, which would soon drop the group after Raw Power only managed to peak at #182 in Billboard. During this period, minimalist composer and former Prime Movers keyboardist Bob Sheff joined as the group's pianist; he was soon replaced by multi-instrumentalist Scott Thurston, who formed an enduring friendship with Williamson. According to Kevin L. Jones, \\"[T]he kind of touring they did was not what you would imagine today, with big buses, fancy stage lighting and expensive equipment. Iggy and the Stooges toured like an invasive species, showing up at whatever venue would have them, scrambling for gear to play through and sucking up the drugs around them like walking Hoovers. Those days are remembered with stories full of blood from random projectiles being thrown at them and even a moment when Elton John jumped onstage wearing a gorilla costume, scaring the living daylights out of Pop.\\" Williamson was briefly dismissed due to criticism from the band's management (likely related to his turbulent romantic relationship with Cyrinda Foxe, a friend of road manager Leee Black Childers); guitarist Tornado Turner replaced him for a single gig (on June 15, 1973 at the Aragon Ballroom) before he was permitted to return. In February 1974, The Stooges disbanded as a result of their dwindling professional opportunities. After the Stooges Williamson collaborated with Pop in 1975 on tumultuous demo sessions for a proposed new album to possibly be produced by John Cale, which were released (despite Pop's objections) in 1977 as Kill City. During this period, Pop was briefly institutionalized of his own volition and Williamson was arrested for possessing heroin by the LAPD. After sustaining a finger injury during a drunken altercation at an Alice Cooper listening party, he gave up playing music professionally to work as a record producer and pursue a higher education as an electronics engineer, initially enrolling in classes at Los Angeles City College: \\"The Stooges was maybe my only real band and kind of a family and so when that fell apart it was difficult to go on.\\" Looking back in 2010, Williamson said, \\"I gave up being a Stooge to study calculus.\\" He noted, \\"It was a rather large existential gap, but I did it.\\" Throughout the late 1970s, he worked on disco sessions as a staff engineer at Paramount Recorders in Los Angeles. In 1979, he was again persuaded to work with Iggy Pop as a producer and songwriter on New Values, his third solo album; in a partial reunion of The Stooges, Scott Thurston played guitar on all the tracks except \\"Don't Look Down.\\" Although Williamson continued to work with Pop on the initial sessions for Soldier (1980) in Wales, he brandished an air pistol and began to drink vodka heavily after failing to acclimate to the singer's new band, including such luminaries as former Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock, Patti Smith Band multi-instrumentalist Ivan Kral and Barry Andrews of XTC. Following a squabble with Pop and David Bowie (who Williamson accused of exploiting The Stooges during the Raw Power era) over recording methods, he left the project. Subsequently, Williamson and Pop would lose touch for 16 years. Williamson reflected on the experience in 2015: \\"Fuck Bowie. His showing up was just the last of many frustrations with being there ... In hindsight, I should have never taken that job. It was recorded in a studio I didn't want to be in, with music that was half-baked and with musicians I didn't respect. It was my own damned fault it didn't work out.\\" After working on Soldier, Williamson left the music business entirely to concentrate on his studies. In 1982, he received an electrical engineering degree from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Technology career Immediately following his graduation from Cal Poly Pomona, Williamson moved to Silicon Valley. For the next fifteen years, he worked for Advanced Micro Devices in San Jose, California, designing products around its chips. His coworkers never inquired about his earlier career as a rock musician; in a 2010 interview with Uncut, Williamson asserted that many of his colleagues were \\"nerds and geeks ... they don't listen to The Stooges much.\\" In 1997, he was hired as Sony's vice president of technical standards; in this capacity, he liaised with competitors and helped to codify nascent industry standards, most notably the Blu-ray Disc. During the Great Recession, he accepted an early retirement buyout offer from Sony in 2009. In 2015, Williamson was selected to receive ANSI's Ronald H. Brown Standards Leadership Award for his contributions to consumer electronics standards development. The award, named after late United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, is presented as part of World Standards Day celebration. Reuniting with The Stooges Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Katowice Off Festval, Poland, on August 4, 2012 Following Ron Asheton's sudden death in 2009, Williamson rejoined The Stooges, who had toured regularly after the Fun House-era lineup (save for Alexander, who had died years previously in 1975) reunited in 2003. To rehearse, he enlisted the help of local roots rock band Careless Hearts, who backed him on his first gig in 35 years at the Blank Club in San Jose, California on September 5, 2009. They performed a number of early Stooges songs, and also some material from the Kill City album. In June 2010, a CD + DVD combo was released of this event called James Williamson with Careless Hearts. The Stooges' first reunion concert with Williamson occurred on November 7, 2009 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The band added material from Raw Power and several of Pop's early solo albums to its repertoire. In March 2010, The Stooges were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The group's current line-up performed \\"Search and Destroy\\" with Scott Thurston. Following several additional tours (many of which included full performances of Raw Power), the band released what would become their last album, Ready to Die, on April 30, 2013 via Fat Possum Records. Produced by Williamson, the album contained ten new Pop-Williamson compositions. Re- Licked, Williamson's first solo studio album, was released by Leopard Lady Records in October 2014. Composed entirely of much-bootlegged songs by Pop and Williamson that were written, demoed and performed by The Stooges in the immediate aftermath of Raw Power, it featured vocal contributions from Jello Biafra, Bobby Gillespie, Ariel Pink, Carolyn Wonderland, Alison Mosshart and Lisa Kekaula along with performances by several members of the reunited Stooges (including bassist Mike Watt and touring drummer Toby Dammit). Pop did not participate in the project, with a representative alleging that \\"Iggy was never given an opportunity to participate on the album. He found out about the project in December of 2013 after it was rejected by a Chicago label.\\" According to Williamson, \\"He gave me his blessing and wished me success. But it's a hard pill to swallow when someone is doing all your songs with your band and you're not on it. I think he's cool with it so far. We'll see how things progress ... I hope he maintains his positive attitude.\\" In a subsequent interview with Rolling Stone, Pop said, \\"I don't have a problem with anything, I don't oppose anything. This statement about the 'hard pill' sounds kind of passive aggressive to me. The guys in the touring group have been phoning and emailing me and my rep before during and after the recordings, wondering how I felt about this. These guys are my friends and we've all worked together many years. I am glad someone is paying them; they are working musicians and they need to play. I want to thank all the wonderful singers on this record for covering my songs.\\" On March 15, 2014, Scott Asheton died of a heart attack at the age of 64. Saxophonist Steve Mackay (who briefly joined the group in mid-1970 before participating in the post-2003 reunion and Re-Licked) also died in October 2015 at the age of 66. On June 22, 2016, Williamson issued an official statement for the band saying that The Stooges are no more: \\"The Stooges is over. Basically, everybody's dead except Iggy and I. So it would be sort-of ludicrous to try and tour as Iggy and The Stooges when there's only one Stooge in the band and then you have side guys. That doesn't make any sense to me.\\" Williamson also added that touring had become boring, and trying to balance the band's career as well as Pop's was a difficult task. Equipment Williamson is known primarily for his use of Gibson Les Paul Custom guitars, but he also plays other guitars live (although Les Paul Customs are his guitar of choice). Williamson says that all the songs on Raw Power were written in his London bedroom on a Gibson B-25 acoustic and the acoustic guitar used in the studio was a Martin D-28. A Vox AC30 amplifier was used for recording Raw Power. Williamson says he plugged his Les Paul Custom into the AC30's Top Boost channel, volume at full and bass low, and played primarily on the Custom's low-impedance (hand wired) bridge humbucker pickup; no effects pedals were used. Williamson often used Marshall amplifiers when playing live in the 1970s, and recently switched to Blackstar Amplification's Artisan 30 for live use. All guitars currently used onstage by Williamson are equipped with low-impedance, microphonic, humbucker pickups modeled after those in his original 1969 Gibson Les Paul Custom. These pickups were custom wound by Jason Lollar who reverse engineered the 1969 pickups, at the suggestion of James' touring guitar tech Derek See, and local tech Brian Michael. In concert, for \\"Gimme Danger\\" and \\"Open Up And Bleed\\", Williamson uses a Fishman Power Bridge piezo pickup equipped Les Paul (patched through a Fishma Aura pedal) for simulated acoustic guitar sounds.

The Society was founded in 1875 in New York City to promote universal brotherhood, the study of philosophy, religion, and science, and to investigate the powers innate in nature and man. Knoche was born at Society's headquarters, then at Point Loma, California, and educated at its schools which pioneered a rounded curriculum including art, music, and drama, completing her education at Theosophical University (PhD 1944). In the 1930s and 1940s she worked at the headquarters in several capacities including the secretarial and editorial staffs. At various times from 1933 to 1946 she also taught violin, Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Bible translation, and Qabbalah at Theosophical University, as well as sculpture and painting at the Lomaland School. After Colonel Arthur L. Conger became leader of the Society in 1945, Knoche became his private secretary and subeditor of The Theosophical Forum. On Conger's death in 1951, she continued as private secretary to the next leader, James A. Long, and was subeditor of Sunrise magazine until his death in 1971. As leader, Knoche emphasized theosophy as a practical and compassionate way of living, believing that \\"mankind is a living brotherhood of human souls, and how and what any one person thinks or does has its inevitable effect on the totality of world thought.\\" She encouraged mutual respect and cooperation among the members of various theosophical organizations, while recognizing the value of each organization as an independent entity. She put special emphasis on the publications program, in print and online, making the full text of virtually all the Society's press publications freely available on the internet. Besides scores of articles in theosophical magazines, especially Sunrise: Theosophic Perspectives, she wrote three books: To Light a Thousand Lamps, The Mystery Schools, and Theosophy in the Qabbalah (forthcoming).

It is in the townland of Cavanakeeran,Ordnance Survey Ireland: Online map viewer (choose \\"historic\\" to see townland boundaries) about from Cookstown, from Dungannon and from Omagh. The 2001 Census recorded a population of 604 people. Pomeroy is atop a large hill that dominates the surrounding countryside. From the Cookstown end, the road through the village gradually climbs a gradient up to a village square, The Diamond. The village is surrounded by the Pomeroy Hills. The surrounding countryside is a mixture of moorland and bog land. Stone age and Bronze Age cairns dot the landscape. Pomeroy is the closest settlement to the geographical centre of Ulster.http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/geography/extremities.html History At the end of the 17th century there was no village in this area, just an extensive forest. In the plantation of Ulster James I and VI granted eight townlands to Sir William Parsons, Surveyor General of Ireland. In 1729 James Lowry inherited the land from his father, Robert of Aghenis Caledon. In the 18th century two new parishes were created in Tyrone, and the same family, the Lowrys (from whom issued the Earls of Belmore), was involved in the establishment of both. Pomeroy was created from part of Donaghmore, while Clogherny was taken from Termonmaguirc. The arrangement was confirmed in 1731 by an Order in Council, which had the same legal status as an Act of Parliament, and the articles of agreement under which it was conducted by the two parties involved, Lord Tyrone and Robert Lowry, suggest the tone: > The name of each of the new erected parishes shall be wrote on a separate > scrole of parchment, roll'd up and put into a hatt, to be held by an > indeffernet person,... and that the said Marcus, Lord Viscount of Tyrone, > and Robert Lowry shall each put his hand into the said hatt, and take > thereout one of the said scroles, and that the advowson of that parish which > shall be mentioned in the said scrole .. to be drawn out of the said hatte, > by the said Lord Tyrone, shall stand and be the advowson of the said .. > Tyrone, his heirs and assigns, for ever.\\" St Mary's Catholic Church, Pomeroy In 1750 Rev. James Lowry was granted the right to hold a weekly market in Pomeroy and an important event was the twice yearly Hiring Fair, held in May and November. Men and women from the surrounding countryside would gather at the fair and hire themselves out as farm workers and servants. In the 1640s the large forest had been stripped of timber and for many years after remained neglected. In 1770 the Rev. James Lowry undertook its management, replanted about and left money to build Pomeroy House. The Lowry family played a big part in the life of the area for about 200 years. In the square is the Church of Ireland church which dates from the early 1840s. Its belfry and tower were paid for by the Lowry family as a token of their esteem for Pomeroy. Much of the woodland is gone and the Georgian mansion demolished. All that remains is the family burial vault on Tanderagee Road. This was once approached by the longest avenue of Chilean pine trees in Ireland. The road leading from Pomeroy to Donaghmore is known as the Royal Road because in 1689 James II and VII took this route to visit his troops in Derry during the historic siege. This route brought him through Cappagh and Altmore. King James‚Äôs Well is by the roadside just outside Cappagh. Transport The Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway opened Pomeroy railway station on 2 September 1861. From 1876 until 1958 it was part of the Great Northern Railway. The Ulster Transport Authority closed the station and the PD&O; line on 15 February 1965. Throughout its history it had the highest altitude of any Irish gauge railway station in Ireland. West of Pomeroy the railway reached its summit, above sea level, the highest point on Ireland's Irish gauge network. Economy Pomeroy is the home of the multi-award-winning farm shop at Cloughbane Farm, which uses only locally sourced meat, vegetables, potatoes, milk and flour in its products. The 180-acre farm is a fourth-generation, family-run beef and lamb farm outside Dungannon. The on-site farm shop and butchers were established in 2003 and in 2006 began selling home-cooked pies and take-away meals. In 2006 the company, which has won five UK Great Taste Awards, expanded after securing a supply deal with Tesco. Sport Pomeroy Plunketts is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.

The term comes from the ideas and proposals of President Woodrow Wilson (1913‚Äì1921). He issued his famous Fourteen Points in January 1918 as a basis for ending World War I and promoting world peace. He was a leading advocate of the League of Nations to enable the international community to avoid wars and end hostile aggression. Wilsonianism is a form of liberal internationalism.Stanley Hoffmann, \\"The Crisis of Liberal Internationalism, Foreign Policy, No. 98 (Spring, 1995), pp. 159‚Äì177. Principles Common principles that are often associated with \\"Wilsonianism\\" include: * Emphasis on self-determination of peoples;Erez Manela, The Wilsonian Moment: Self- Determination and the International Origins of Anticolonial Nationalism (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 41-42.Antonio Cassese, Self-Determination of Peoples: A Legal Reappraisal (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp. 19-21. * Advocacy of the spread of democracy; * Advocacy of the spread of capitalism; and * Support for collective security, and least partial opposition to American isolationism. Historian Joan Hoff writes, \\"What is 'normal' Wilsonianism remains contested today. For some, it is 'inspiring liberal internationalism' based on adherence to self-determination; for others, Wilsonianism is the exemplar of humanitarian intervention around the world,' making U.S. foreign policy a paragon of carefully defined and restrict use of force.\\"Joan Hoff, A Faustian Foreign Policy from Woodrow Wilson to George W. Bush: Dreams of Perfectability (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 61. Amos Perlmutter defined Wilsonianism as simultaneously consisting of \\"liberal interventionism, self-determination, nonintervention, humanitarian intervention\\" oriented in support of collective security, open diplomacy, capitalism, American exceptionalism, and free and open borders, and opposed to revolution.

It was invented by Francis Bowyer Miller (patented 1867). This chemical process involves blowing a stream of pure chlorine gas over and through a crucible filled with molten, but impure, gold. This process purifies the gold because nearly all other elements will form chlorides before gold does, and they can then be removed as salts that are insoluble in the molten metal. When all impurities have been removed from the gold (observable by a change in flame color) the gold is removed and processed in the manner required for sale or use. The resulting gold is 99.5% pure, but of lower purity than gold produced by the other common refining method, the Wohlwill process, which produces gold to 99.999% purity. The Wohlwill process is commonly used for producing high-purity gold, such as in electronics work and the manufacture of some silicates, where exacting standards of purity are required.

Stowell was born on March 29, 1846 in Perry, New York. In 1865, at the age of 19, he graduated from Genesee College (now Syracuse University). He went on to earn a Master's degree in 1868 and a Ph.D. in 1881 from the same institution. After graduating from college in 1865, he became principal of the Addison Academy in Addison, New York. One year later, he was in charge of the Academic Department of the Union School in Morrisville, New York. The next year he was a professor of mathematics at Genesee Wesleyan Seminary. The year after he was principal of Morris High School in Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1869 Stowell became the Chair of Natural Sciences at the new (founded 1868) Cortland State Normal School in Cortland, New York, now known as the State University of New York at Cortland. After having just held four jobs in four years, he stayed at Cortland for 20 years. Stowell left Cortland in 1889 to become the principal of the Potsdam Normal School in Potsdam, New York, now known as the State University of New York at Potsdam. He remained at Potsdam for another 20 years. In 1909 he was awarded an honorary LL.D. from St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. In 1909 Stowell left Potsdam to become the founding chair of the new Department of Education in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Southern California (USC). In 1918 USC established its School of Education, and Stowell became the founding dean of the school. In addition to his administrative roles, Stowell was also an accomplished scientist. His work included the fields of human and comparative anatomy, microscopy, and comparative neurology. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; a charter member of the Association of American Anatomists and a member of their nomenclature committee; and a member of the Microscopy Society of America and American History Association. Stowell was particularly known for his pamphlets on the origin and cranial nerves of the domestic cat. In 1891 he was a contributor to Volume 1 of The Journal of Comparative Neurology. Thomas Blanchard Stowell retired in 1919 after a career of 54 years in education. The University of Southern California named the Thomas Blanchard Stowell Hall of Education and Stowell Research Library in his honor. In 1963 SUNY Potsdam named its Stowell Hall in his honor.

Its southern terminus is at the Florida state line south-southeast of Thomasville, where the roadway continues as US 19/SR 57\\\\. This is also the southern terminus of SR 3, with which US 19 and SR 300 travel concurrently through the southern part of the state. Its northern terminus is at Interstate 75 (I-75) in Cordele. This is the second state route in Georgia to carry the SR 300 designation. The earlier one, in a different part of the state, was much shorter, traveling from Monticello to a point northeast of Monticello (and about north of Eatonton), and existed from the 1960s to the 1980s. Route description =Florida to Albany= Southern terminus of SR 3/SR 300 at the FL state line. SR 300 begins at the Florida state line, where it is concurrent with US 19\\\\. On the Florida side of the state line, US 19 is concurrent with Florida State Road 57 (SR 57, which is unsigned), and is known as the Florida‚ÄìGeorgia Parkway. At the state line, SR 3 and SR 300 begin. US 19/SR 3/SR 300 head northwest until they enter Thomasville. In the city, they intersect US 84/SR 38, which head east to Valdosta. Here, they join the concurrency. Also, this intersection marks the eastern terminus of US 84 Business/SR 38 Business. Farther to the northwest, the five routes intersect US 319/SR 35, where US 84/SR 38 depart to the west, along with SR 3 Alternate (SR 3 Alt.). In Meigs, SR 111 intersects the concurrency, along with the northern terminus of SR 3 Alt. In Camilla, the highways have intersections with SR 37 and SR 112, and curve to make a slight jog to the northeast until they reach Albany. =Albany to Cordele= Most of the route of SR 300 in Albany is on the Liberty Expressway, a freeway-grade bypass of the city's downtown to the northeast. In the southeastern part of the city is an intersection with SR 133, which joins the concurrency, and the eastern terminus of SR 234\\\\. Nearly later, the concurrency intersects US 19 Bus./US 82 Bus./SR 520 Bus., where US 19 Bus. has its southern terminus. Slightly later is US 82/SR 520\\\\. They join the US 19/SR 3/SR 133 concurrency, while US 82/SR 300/SR 520 head east for just over , where SR 300 splits off to the northeast. It travels through rural areas until it reaches the Cordele area. Just before entering Cordele proper is SR 300 Connector and US 41/SR 7\\\\. Upon entering Cordele, the route meets its northern terminus, an interchange with I-75. History =1920s= The roadway that would eventually become the current SR 300 was established in 1920 as SR 3 from Thomasville to Albany, via Camilla. By October 1926, nearly all of the aforementioned route was paved. By October 1929, SR 3 was extended southwest to where US 319 currently crosses the state line. US 19 was designated along this route to Thomasville, and then its current route from Thomasville to Albany. SR 35 was designated along a portion of highway that is the current route of US 19 from the Florida state line to Thomasville. =1930s= By 1935, nearly all of the northern half of the section of SR 35 between the Florida state line and Thomasville was paved. Prior to the beginning of 1936, nearly all of that section of SR 35 was paved. By July, the rest of that section was paved. In March 1937, the section of SR 300 that currently travels from Albany to Cordele was established as a northern extension of SR 133. By October the routings of the portions of US 19 southwest of Thomasville was shifted to its current routing, while SR 3 stayed on its original routing. The following August, a small portion of SR 133 southwest of Cordele was paved. =1940s= By 1944, a very brief section of SR 133 northeast of Albany was paved. In early 1946, approximately half of the length of SR 133 between Warwick and Cordele was paved. In early 1948, all of SR 133 was redesignated as SR 257\\\\. The section of SR 257 from Albany to the intersection with SR 32 and the section from Lake Blackshear to Cordele were paved. In 1950, nearly all of SR 257 was paved. =1950s to 1980s= By 1952, the entire roadway that would eventually become SR 300 was paved. A section of the highway from Albany to Cordele was proposed as Interstate 175 and then cancelled, but in early 1982, the Georgia‚ÄìFlorida Parkway was approved to be designated along the entire stretch of what is now SR 300. By the next year, all of SR 257 was redesignated as SR 300 and the designation was applied to the rest of its current route. Later that year, the routings of SR 3 and SR 35 south of Thomasville were swapped. Major intersections Cordele connector route State Route 300 Connector (SR 300 Conn.) is a connector route of the SR 300 mainline that exists entirely within Crisp County. It follows Old Albany Highway from an intersection with SR 300 southwest of Cordele and travels northeast until it meets its northern terminus, an intersection with US 280/SR 30 west of the city.

The school was located on its original site in Harpur ward, near the centre of Bedford, until its closure in 2012. In September 2010 the junior department of the school merged with the junior department of Dame Alice Harpur School. From September 2011 to September 2012 the senior schools also merged, the new school is known as Bedford Girls' School. History The school was opened on May 8, 1882. It was built on the site of former Harpur Trust cottage almshouses. There were 43 girls on that first day: > \\"The young ones with hair in pigtails, wearing pinafores, the elder ones > with their hair up, wearing skirts down to the ankles. It was not a uniform > as such, but with the strict code of respectability they made a fairly > uniform impression. Boaters and gloves were worn in town. They never spoke a > word inside the building unless spoken to by staff.\\" Under the early headmistresses Miss Belcher, Miss Collier, Miss Tanner and Dr Westaway the school expanded enormously. In 1924 Miss Tanner was poached by Roedean School New school buildings encroached on the nearby houses of Adelaide Square and The Crescent, but never blocking the view of the fine Victorian architecture of the main building from Bromham Road. The original school at first housed both the \\"High and Modern School for Girls\\". Each school had its own half of the building, but by the end of the century the Modern School moved to premises of its own in the centre of the town, and in 1938 to its present site near the river where, from 1946, it became known as Dame Alice Harpur School. The High School underwent many extensions and additions to its buildings. The Junior School acquired a new wing in 1896, and remained there until moving into a building in Adelaide Square in 1985. In the 1890s the Main Hall was extended out towards the road so that it became T shaped. It also obtained a pipe organ built by Norman and Beard of Norwich which was used for daily assemblies. Other notable changes included the gym built in 1931 which became a theatre, the acquisition of the former Trinity Church which was converted into a dining hall with classrooms above in 1981 and, most recently, in 2005, the new sports and performing arts complex with many facilities including a 25 x 13 m swimming pool. At first the morning register was called in the hall after assembly, but soon the numbers had exceeded 100 and so registers were taken in the form rooms. By the turn of the century the numbers were above 600, at which level they stabilised until the late seventies when again they grew, reaching around a thousand in the eighties. Sport in the early years of the school consisted of drill given by a sergeant. The gymnastic dress was made of heavy thick blue serge with a light blue sailor collar. Games only began when an asphalt tennis court was laid down in what became the playground. In 1900 the school acquired the field which is where the girls went to play games. The flourishing of a lively PE department owed much to the vision of PE teacher Miss Stansfeld (BHS 1887-1918). Before its closure, the school had 22 acres (89,000 m¬≤) of games field and a spa centre ('the Canary Cage'), formally opened in 2005 by past pupil Dr Stephanie Cook OBE, (Olympic gold champion and World Champion in the modern pentathlon). Music, Dance and Drama always played a large part in school life: > \\"Miss Belcher was keen on music, and arranged for five pianos to be placed > in a large room, each enclosed in as many glass cases, and just big enough > for a pupil and a music teacher. In this way, it was said, the girls would > be able to practise in school without disturbing one another! It probably > had more to do with making it possible for one mistress to chaperone the > girls with their music masters. Mr Bond-Andrews, the piano teacher, would > have none of it: he dragged the first piano out of its glass case, wishing > with all his heart for it to be suffocated. Dr Harding was in charge of > music for four decades: designing the new organ, and building up a music > department with excellent orchestras and choirs. Today there are still those > who remember the dreaded Miss Joyce Harding, his daughter, who trained the > choirs, and auditioned all junior girls at the beginning of each year. Those > who could not sing in tune were labelled \\"ghosties\\" and were only allowed to > mouth!\\" This tradition of mouthing continued to the closure of the school. Musical alumnae include the soprano Agnes Nicholls (Lady Hamilton Harty), the clarinetist Dame Thea King, and more recently the soprano Alison Buchanan and cellist Naomi Williams. Royalty have visited the school on two occasions. King George V and Queen Mary paid a visit in 1918 and they complimented Miss Collie on the way the girls curtsied, and Dr Harding on the way they sang \\"God Save the King\\". On another occasion, in 1942, they sang the Yugoslavian national anthem. This was for the visit of Queen Marie of Yugoslavia. A governor was heard to remark afterwards how clever the choir were to learn it in such a short time, and in a foreign language. They had, in fact, been singing the song in English. William Eddy was caretaker at the High School for 47 years. He was always at the door in his livery on special occasions to welcome parents and guests. Mrs Frieda Bray came during World War II to help for two weeks in the Domestic Science department but stayed for forty years, working in the milk room and looking after the welfare of pupils and staff alike. From the start in 1882 hymns were sung every day, accompanied by the piano and then, from 1898, on Mr William's organ. Girls always kneeled for prayers, even in the early 1960s when on one occasion a girl in the front row of the gallery knelt down rather quickly, thrusting her head between the vertical wooden railings where it got stuck! A railing had to be sawn through in order to free her. A bible reading, a hymn and a chanted psalm were mandatory until the 1980s when psalm singing went out of fashion. Hymns were still sung regularly, and assemblies were always centred on enforcing the religion of Christianity, or school matters such as the correct way to wear uniform. =Later history= Before closure about ten percent of the girls attending the school were boarders, living in four boarding houses: Wimborne Grange, The Quantocks, Westlands and The Chilterns. Many day girls travelled quite long journeys to the school. Girls studied for GCSEs and A levels as well as the International Baccalaureate. In the last years the school took on a very multicultural character, reflected not just in the English language support given to the international students and the variety of Language A levels taken, but also in the social life: linguistic assemblies and fundraising days in which girls were sponsored for a variety of things, such as speaking all day in a language other than their mother tongue. In the sports department girls frequently competed at county and national levels, and the hockey and lacrosse teams travelled to the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and Prague. In the music department tuition was offered in all orchestral instruments, keyboard, guitar, piano, recorder, percussion and singing, and there were choirs and orchestras. The last school uniform consisted of a traditional Scottish kilt in school tartan, a green or navy blue jumper and a white shirt with a small green eagle representative of the Harpur Trust sewn into the collar. =Merger= In July 2009 the Harpur Trust announced its intention to merge Bedford High School with Dame Alice Harpur School, because the schools had seen a drop in pupil numbers over the years: In 1990 more than 2,000 girls were on the rolls of the two schools, but in 2009 there were only 1,500. In November 2009 it was announced that the new merged school would be called Bedford Girls' School, and would be located on the current site of Dame Alice Harpur School. The junior department of the new school opened in September 2010, when the junior schools of Bedford High and Dame Alice Harper merged on the Cardington Road site. The senior department of Bedford High School started to transfer to the new school in September 2011, with the full merger, including the sixth form department completed in September 2012. In September 2012, Bedford College leased most of the site of the former Bedford High School for a campus in the north of Bedford town centre. The college later bought the old main school buildings, Trinity Church, and the Sports and Performing Arts (SPA) complex from owners, the Harpur Trust in March 2014. The college does not occupy the neighbouring accommodation such as former houses in Adelaide Square that were used by the school. The Bedford Sixth Form (which is Bedford College‚Äôs branding of its sixth form provision) now occupies the campus and the SPA complex runs under Trinity Arts & Leisure, managed by Bedford College Services Ltd.

Biography Efr√©n P√©rez Rivera was born on March 10, 1929 at Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, where he lived during his first years. At the age of four, he moved with his family to Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. He attended the College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts (known today as the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez), obtaining a bachelor's degree in biology in 1952. P√©rez later became a professor of biology and chemistry at the Pe√±uelas High School. P√©rez did his obligatory military service in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, during which he was stationed in Hawaii. In 1953, he worked at the Agricultural Experimental Station at both Isabela and Lajas. He later obtained a master's degree in environmental health from the Tropical School of Medicine at San Juan. Community involvement During the 1960s, P√©rez became a member of Cabo Rojo's Credit and Savings Cooperative( Cooperativa de Ahorro y Cr√©dito de Cabo Rojo) and joined its Education Committee. As a member of this committee, he visited the communities of Cabo Rojo and worked to make the public aware of the philosophy and advantages of the cooperative movement. Also, he was the president of the Supervision Committee. During the first half of the 1970s, he worked in the Cooperative Development Administration. In December 1977 he obtained a master's degree in Horticulture from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. He then went on to become a professor in the College of Agricultural Science from that institution. During this time, he also took an active role in the organization of Cabo Rojo's Cooperative Pharmacy (Farmacia Cooperativa de Cabo Rojo) and became the president of its board of directors. In 1983 he became the president of the Puerto Rican Independence Party's (PIP) Cabo Rojo committee. In 1988, under his presidency, the party obtained the largest percentage of local votes for the governor's seat in the history of Cabo Rojo (11.2%). He also obtained the largest percentage of votes for a district representative seat, compared with the rest of his fellow candidates. His knowledge and convictions led him to join the environmental crusades against the Adjuntas copper mines, the construction of Club Med in Gu√°nica, the installation of a Voice of America transmitter in Cabo Rojo, the construction of the Cogentrix carbon-based electrical plant in Mayag√ºez, amongst others. In 1990 P√©rez organized Caborroje√±os Pro Salud y Ambiente This organization was designed to encourage and promote the well being, the conservation of natural resources and the sustainable economic development of the Cabo Rojo region. Caborroje√±os pro Salud y Ambiente along with United States Fish and Wildlife Service were the primary promoters of a research and visitors center located at the Cabo Rojo salt mines. The center is named Centro Intepretativo Las Salinas De Cabo Rojo don Efr√©n P√©rez Rivera in his honor. In a joint venture with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, the committee had a major role in the restoration project of Isla de Ratones, a small key by the coast of Cabo Rojo that is rapidly losing its surface area due to erosion. P√©rez has occupied the presidency of Caborroje√±os pro Salud y Ambiente several times from its inception through 2005 when he was succeeded by fellow professor Pedro Valle Carlo. P√©rez died on May 15, 2011. Awards and recognitions P√©rez has been recognized by several institutions and organization for his civic work and pro-environment values. Some of the institutions and organizations that have recognized his work are: * The University of Puerto Rico * The Ana G.

It is a study of a sporty two seat roadster, with mid-engine and rear wheel drive. The Concept R is powered by a V6 3.2 L FSI petrol engine developing a maximum output of at 6,250 rpm and of torque at 2,800 rpm. It is strong enough to accelerate the car from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.3 seconds, and make it reach the electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). Without the speed governor, the car would be even able to reach the top speed of 270 km/h (167 mph). The power is transferred to the road via a six speed direct-shift gearbox. The designer team for this concept was led by Murat G√ºnak and Peter Schreyer, and broke the ground for the Volkswagen brand in developing the roadster vehicle. At of length, of width and of height, the Concept R roadster has almost the same length and width as the fifth generation Volkswagen Golf hatchback, on whose platform it has been built. The concept has some interesting design features such as the Volkswagen logo, which is generated digitally by a display and begins to pulsate in the so-called OLED screen when the driver turns on the ignition. When the ignition is activated, the pulse stops. Also, its seats are not adjustable in any way and the driver must electrically move the polished metal information block of the instrument panel, including the steering wheel and pedal cluster back or forth to find the correct seating position. For the first time in a sports car, the seats are filled with active foam which adapts to the body shape of the driver and passenger. At a press dinner held during the 2005 North American International Auto Show, Bernd Pischetsrieder, the chairman of the Volkswagen Group, confirmed that Volkswagen intended to build a production vehicle similar to this concept. As of , no production model has appeared, however another, similar, concept car, the Volkswagen Concept BlueSport, was unveiled at the 2009 North American International Auto Show.

The song was written during the 1844 lockout of coal miners. Many of the striking miners were evicted from their homes in Seghill during this dispute. Thomas Burt wrote of the situation: :the very magnitude of the evictions, extending over nearly the whole of the mining districts of Northumberland and Durham, made it impossible to find house accommodation for a twentieth part of the evicted. Scores of the Seghill families camped out by the roadside between that village and the Avenue Head.Thomas Burt, An Autobiography (1924), pages 36-37 in  Transport  Seghill served by a railway station but it was closed in November 1964 along with the rest of the passenger services on the Blyth & Tyne route north of Backworth.

Managed and Captained by Ian Clark, Seghill had a good first season finishing 3rd in the league, just one place below a playoff position. On 6 April 2008 Seghill played in the NK Cup Final against Sports For Youth in sub zero conditions. Despite losing 2 players to the cold in the 2nd half Seghill came from behind twice to win the game 3-2 and claim their first piece of silverware in their rookie season. Despite starting their second season with an unbeaten run that stretched beyond Christmas and building up a double figure lead over their nearest rivals, Seghill were eventually undone by the weather. Due to the large number of postponed fixtures throughout the season Seghill were left to play out the last few weeks with 3 or more games per week. This led to problems with squad members securing time off work and with just a couple of games left Seghill were pipped at the post to finish 2nd in the league. Despite it being a better showing than the previous season there was widespread disappointment that the season had ended without any silverware.

His installation took place at the Cathedral of St. Louis on March 25 of that year. Carberry was considered more theologically conservative than his predecessor, Cardinal Joseph Ritter. One publication even described him as being \\"threatened by a world he does not understand.\\" He strongly defended Humanae vitae, and created the Archdiocesan Pro-Life Commission. Paul VI created him Cardinal Priest of S. Giovanni Battista de Rossi a via Latina in the consistory of April 28, 1969. In 1969 he removed about 60 of his seminarians from a class at the Saint Louis University Divinity School, in objection to their being taught Pauls' epistles by the Presbyterian scholar Keith Nickle. In 1971 he made a controversial decision to close McBride High school in largely black North St. Louis, while subsidizing a swimming pool at Kennedy High School in a wealthy suburb; the Kennedy High School closed in 2017 for lack of enrollment. Carberry moved his own residence from the episcopal residence in town to suburban Creve Coeur. In 1972, Carberry established the Urban Services Apostolate for inner-city parishes in the archdiocese. He was elected vice-president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1974, and was a delegate to the World Synod of Bishops in 1972, 1974 and 1976. Carberry initially opposed the reception of communion by hand, believing it was irreverent and risked the possibility of stealing Hosts to use at Black Masses. However, he later permitted this practice in St. Louis in 1977. That same year, he ordained the first permanent deacons in the archdiocese. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II, respectively. Carberry helped lead an internal campaign against the liberal Archbishop Jean Jadot, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, whom he perceived as \\"destroying the Catholic Church in the United States.\\" He was a vocal critic of the television sitcom Maude, which he said \\"injected CBS-TV as advocate of a moral and political position that many not only oppose but find positively offensive as immoral. ...The decision to secure an abortion or the decision to have a vasectomy, even for those who choose them, is hardly a joke.\\" =Later life and death= Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Carberry resigned as Archbishop of St. Louis on July 31, 1979. He was succeeded by Bishop John L. May, then serving as Bishop of Mobile. After suffering a stroke in 1988, he moved into St. Agnes Home in Kirkwood, where he died at age 93. He is buried in the crypt of the Cathedral of St. Louis.

History The place-name 'Benwell' is first attested in the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto circa 1050 AD, where it appears as Bynnewalle, from the Old English bionnan walle, meaning \\"inside the wall\\".Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.38. This refers to Benwell's position relative to Hadrian's Wall (adjoining which was the Roman fort of Condercum, hence the modern Condercum Road nearby). The fort was covered over by subsequent development in the area, but the remains of a Roman temple can still be seen in the vicinity.https://www.english- heritage.org.uk/visit/places/benwell-roman-temple-hadrians-wall/history/ Benwell is situated between Hadrian's Wall to the north and the River Tyne to the south, and in medieval times it was part of the Barony of Bolbec.The Baronies of Bolbec, Archaeologia Aeliana, 3, XXI, p. 146 By the 13th century the medieval manor of Benwell had been subdivided, originally into two, but then one of the halves was further subdivided. So, although people usually refer to the three sections of Benwell Manor as ‚Äòthirds‚Äô, this gives a misleading impression, because one of the ‚Äòthirds‚Äô was larger and wealthier than the other two. This third belonged to the Scot family, who were wealthy merchants from Newcastle and by 1296 they were the principal taxpayers in Benwell. The Scot family later went on to create a deer park in 1367, which later became Scotswood. Charlotte Pit, Benwell, c. 1935 In the 16th century Benwell village was arranged in two rows of houses on either side of a wide street or green. A plain oblong tower, three storeys high with battlements around the roof was also recorded as being built. In 1540, the Crown, under King Henry VIII, took possession of Benwell Tower from Tynemouth Priory when it dissolved the monasteries. Early in the 17th century, Benwell was split into smaller estates which were bought by the Shafto and Riddell families who were merchant families interested in exploiting the coal reserves on the banks of the Tyne. Benwell Colliery was opened in 1766 and operated until 1938. The original layout of Benwell exists in the form of Benwell Village, Benwell Lane, Ferguson's Lane and Fox and Hounds Lane; however, no buildings still exist other than from the early 19th century. The tower from the 16th century was rebuilt in the 18th century and then all traces were removed when the present hall, Benwell Towers was built in a Tudor style by John Dobson in 1831. Benwell Towers featured in the BBC television show Byker Grove. By the 1990s, Benwell was widely regarded as one of the most troubled parts of Tyneside, if not the whole of Britain. In April 1994, The Independent reported that unemployment in the area stood at 24% (well over twice the national average) and that drug abuse and arson were both a major problem in the area, with a number of arson attacks known to have been carried out in an attempt to intimidate witnesses to crimes and deter them from giving evidence in court. Much like similar parts of West Newcastle, since the 2010s, regeneration has been underway with new housing developments and improved community facilities across Benwell, including 2000-home housing estate, The Rise, and improvements to Benwell's main shopping centres. Governance The area is represented on Newcastle City Council as part of the Benwell and Scotswood ward, with three Labour councillors, including Jeremy Beecham, the former chairman of the Labour Party and the Local Government Association.

It was released in 1983 by Bug-Byte. Gameplay Twin Kingdom Valley is a work of interactive fiction where the player enters commands such as \\"take jug\\" at a command prompt and is told the outcome of their move (\\"I have it now\\"). Each such command takes up one unit of time, during which other non-player characters will also move and take actions. It was one of the first text adventure games to have active non-player characters. The characters are interactive, and have their own personalities: some are friendly, and will follow and defend the player, while others are hostile. Witches and kings are complex characters, whereas gorillas and trolls are simpler. Battle sequences have additional features including weapons which can be dropped, broken, thrown or taken away by enemies. Plot The main character of this game, referred to as \\"you\\" by the game engine, is a treasure hunter.http://solutionarchive.com/game/id%2C564/Twin+Kingdom+Valley.html The player starts the game at the southern edge of the forest kingdom, with few possessions. An early encounter with the innkeeper of The Sword Inn may persuade the player to rent a small log cabin from him. In the cabin are some very meager supplies, such as a plain jug. To progress through the game, the player must determine which characters to regard as friends, and which as foes. Some characters, such as a gorilla who attacks the player with a wooden club, are clearly presented as foes, while others are ambiguous. There are two kingdoms - a forest and a desert - separated by a deep canyon. Each kingdom is ruled by a king, and the kings do not get along with one another. The player is told that the situation has got worse recently, and a royal from the forest kingdom is missing, the crime being attributed to the desert king. With two rich kingdoms at war, it is suggested that the player could take advantage of this and loot treasure from both sides. As the game progresses, the player finds it a challenge to transport spoils back to the log cabin, and is forced at times to choose between carrying a treasure and carrying a weapon, both types of object being at risk of theft if left unguarded. The plot develops over time. In the original BBC Micro game, there were a limited number of locations and graphics. Some additions appear in the C64 version, though the plot is largely the same. The modern smartphone edition of the game yet more locations and some new plot twists. Development = Concept = The game was inspired by the original Adventure by Will Crowther.http://solutionarchive.com/interview_trevor/ The original game engine was written in 6502 assembly language. The game was then ported to Z80 for the Spectrum. The newer versions (for Commodore 64 and Spectrum) have an extended game. The game set out to add a level of realism through the addition of images, and complex characters. The beginnings of the game were more of a peer pressure challenge than a commercial venture. At that time, access to the \\"massive machines\\" (by the standards of the day) needed to run the original adventure were limited. The thought was: surely this can be done on a home computer, somehow. The slowness of high level language code (Basic) on home systems ruled that out as a path, and there was no access to a FORTRAN compiler at the time. That's why assembly was chosen. Few people had run the original, and (having graduated) those students who had access to university equipment capable of running the game had lost that privileged access. So the elements recalled (teasingly) resembled the original, with a road, a building (containing useful items, such as keys and a lamp) being repeated. The building is in the forest, with a spring nearby. However, beyond this teaser that it is a kind of clone, the similarity ends. The plan changed to \\"why copy, when you can do better\\". Rather than just modelling a cave, the challenge was to model a larger world, with many above ground, underground, inside and outside locations. A somewhat medieval era was chosen for the game, allowing elements of mysticism. All combat was designed as basic hand-to-hand style, with the player and other characters taking turns to trade blows, Turns are always initiated by the player's typing, rather than occurring in real time. If the player attempts to flee from combat, the opponent is permitted one attack before the player moves. The player's behavior is modelled in the same manner as the characters. Like similar games, characters have various limits, such as their maximum health and rate of healing, and the carrying capacity. = Graphics = A major section of the software is a custom graphics language, which is an early scalable vector graphics format. Hundreds of images of objects and locations are drawn in the game using this custom tool. Perspective of a limited kind is achieved by permitting images to be drawn scaled down within another image. For example, a castle model would be designed for close up view, but could also be drawn as a subroutine for a distant castle in a desert. The graphics speed was about 10 polygons per second, so the game could not afford to write background polygons and over fill. Images are just created by flood fills, such that each screen pixels is filled only once. A modern PC (using an emulator) can paint these pictures instantly, but the original game owners would need to wait three or four seconds for the screen to paint. The graphics commands had to be heavily compressed, due to the limited memory space budget. Consider a line drawing call, which does a \\"draw to\\" from current position, with a color and new x,y coordinates. If you use 6502 to: load register x with the x coordinate, load register y with the y coordinate, load accumulator with a color, and then call \\"Draw line\\", you have used up 9 bytes. If there are a total of 1000 such lines in all game images, then that would be 9K gone. The actual memory used for a draw command in the game is 2 bytes. To draw and fill an outline, 3 basic commands are needed: Move, Draw, Fill. A move (to start of shape) followed by drawing to each point on the outline, until the shape is closed, then filling within the shape. Draw and fill need a color for the line. All of Move Draw and Fill need a coordinate. To decode this efficiently, just 2 bits are needed to resolve \\"Move, Draw, Fill, \\"any other instruction\\" in an assembly language. An extra bit determines if the command has absolute screen coordinates, or a relative position. 3 bits give a choice of 8 colors, and finally 10 bits give two 5 bit x,y coordinates. The other commands (not needing coordinates) included: Calling a subroutine, ending a subroutine, drawing a circular arc (center at the last moved coordinate) etc. Complex images, such as a cabin made of many logs, use a loop instruction, similar to for loop in C, with a constant loop limit. The assembly language has no concept of variables, and no branching instructions. = Game engine = The game has several micro databases of information, representing the locations, objects which can be used, various creatures, and other data. The game engine runs a simulated world for these items. A small AI module allows the non-player characters to make decisions.http://solutionarchive.com/interview_trevor/ The location engine has some features to save memory. In most locations there are just a few words, but a detailed (bit packed) \\"exit database\\" is interpreted to make longer descriptions. These descriptions can vary as bits are set and cleared for locked and unlocked doors. A location with about eight lines of text describing it may be less than 30 bytes of data. Words used in the game location database are stored as a single byte per word, which look up into a 256 word list, and as a result many words are reused several times. For example, \\"You are by a babbling brook, North you can see a stream, South you can see a road, North West is a deep river\\". The words \\"You are\\" are added by the game engine. \\"by a babbling brook\\" is just 4 bytes of data, a 5th byte encodes the length (4) of the message in words. The location has 3 exits, which are coded as 2 or 3 bytes per exit. Byte 1 has the compass direction plus up or down (6 bits for N,S,E,W,U,D). An additional bit marks special exits such as locked doors. An additional byte then defines various bits for locked/unlocked or \\"can see through, cannot see through\\" etc. Finally a byte for the destination. The first word of the destination is then skipped, so: If North led to \\"By a stream\\", the word \\"By\\" is omitted, and the words \\"you can see\\" are added, giving \\"North you can see a stream\\" using just 2 bytes. All of this compression was needed to fit the game within the 32k limit or the original BBC Micro system. 10k is lost as the screen buffer, so the game memory is down to 22k from the start. With some of the memory needed for variable space or stack, the available code are in such as system is nearer to 20k. If the game had 200 locations at 30 bytes per location, this would be 6k. Even this would leave almost no space for game code, especially graphics. The original versions of the game had fewer than 200 unique locations, for this reason. There are roughly 180 locations in early editions (such as that of the BBC Micro), and 190 in later editions (such as the Commodore 64 version). Other game tables (such as those for creatures or objects) are much smaller. The game has a small data reset block, which re-locks doors and other objects when the player starts a new game. In later versions (such as C64), extra memory allowed for some longer messages in plain text for special game events and puzzles. Because creatures can hold objects, all creatures are treated as special locations by the game engine. An object has a single byte location which can be a room or a creature, and all locations above 200 are reserved for creatures, or other special location codes (such as \\"broken\\"). = Continued development = The game was in active development again in 2006, due to the availability of new platforms. The game engine has been ported, from the original 6502, into Java, with some game design tools in C#. Reception Reviews were generally positive. The World of Spectrum link has many screen captures of magazine reviews of the game. Here are the ratings given by Crash Magazine, for the ZX Spectrum version: * Atmosphere: 9 * Vocabulary: 7 * Logic: 7 * Debugging: 7 * Overall value: 8 That review comments on the peculiarities which occur when porting games from the BBC micro or C64 to the ZX Spectrum. The original BBC version had been reported by the maker, Bug Byte, as a \\"No. 1 hit\\" by one magazine, reportedly based on sales figures. There is little or no information available on how magazines at the time compiled such charts. However, the sales were clearly significant enough for the publisher to request the various ports listed, and to run many full page adverts for the game. Letters were sent to the game publisher, in a time before \\"internet review systems\\" had been created. These are long lost, but did include generally positive comments. Most notable among them was a letter from the father of a blind child, who was able to play the game, thanks to the included speech synthesizer support.

Land ownership in Turkey had been constrained by the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. This was to prevent foreigners from competing with natives for desirable property. This policy was continued when Turkey became independent in the early 20th century. The policy was relaxed during the 21st century.The hot spots: where will we buy next?, The Observer, 26 November 2006 In 2003, property purchases were opened to foreign nationals though restrictions were retained for various provinces. When these restrictions were violated in 2005, the law was annulled by Turkish courts. Despite this, property purchases continue. As of 2008, 63,085 properties had been sold to over 73,103 foreigners. This includes of land valued at US$10.4 billion, mostly by German, British and Greek citizens. Land ownership in Turkey The Turkish government controls a high proportion of land, either directly, under the authority of the Undersecretariat of Treasury Hazine in daily language or indirectly through the inheritance and management of Ottoman foundations vakƒ±f under the authority of the General Directorate for Foundations. History During the weakening phase of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century and the global dominance of western colonialism, purchases without constraint and effective surveillance of real estate by the nationals and companies of western powers was one of the issues on which the Ottoman state had been subjected to the direst foreign pressures. As a consequence of these pressures, The Ottoman Land Code of 1858 was passed. An 1858 firman on \\"Reform\\" had announced a grant of permission in this respect, but the necessary legal arrangements had been delayed till 1868. With the enactment of the 1868 regulation, according to one estimate, British capitalist-farmers (see Levantine mansions of ƒ∞zmir) had almost immediately emerged as having acquired one third of all arable lands in the entire vilayet of ƒ∞zmir (Aydƒ±n in name), possibly held in an indirect manner till then, and by 1878, the majority of the arable land in the same province. This trend coincided with the influx of refugees from lands lost for the Ottoman Empire, and the migrants often saw themselves having to buy property from foreigners in their own country.Osmanlƒ± Ekonomisi ve D√ºnya Kapitalizmi - Ottoman economy and the world capitalism (1820‚Äì1913); Yurt Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1984, Ankara; by ≈ûevket Pamuk. A further law in 1913 also allowed foreign legal entities (companies, foundations etc.) to purchase property in Ottoman lands, with decisive effects for the early foundations of the state of Israel. A partial about-face by the Committee of Union and Progress, simultaneous to the outbreak of the World War I in Europe, was one of the causes for the deterioration of relations between Turkey and the Allied powers Britain, France and Italy. The Treaty of Lausanne which established modern Turkey laid a ground based on a strict understanding of reciprocity in the matter, on a bilateral and contractual bases as concluded with individual countries at first, and full legal reciprocity after 1934. Legal framework However, following steps taken by Turkey's main opposition party CHP, the modifications brought by the 2003 by-law were declared as void by the Turkish Constitutional Court on 26 April 2005, in a decision to enter into effect as of 27 July 2005 and the purchase of real estate by foreign nationals was suspended until a modified law dated 7 January 2006 was brought into effect. This law, Law Nr. 5444, now enacted, instead of being a by-law modifying various paragraphs of the 1934 Property Act, is a fully stated legal text (still on the basis of a modification of the 1934 Act).1934 Property Act, in Turkish # A foreign national cannot purchase more than 25,000m2 (6 acres) of land (constructed or not) in Turkey without special consent from the Turkish Council of Ministers. The council of Ministers is authorised to increase this limit up to 300,000m2 per person. # Foreign national ownership of real estate cannot exceed 10% of land in any designated town. # The property also has to be within a designated or zoned area in a municipality. Foreigners can not buy in villages. Foreign ownership market trends to 2005 It was also observed that, during this 2-year period, the districts most favoured by foreign buyers were Alanya, Fethiye, Didim, Bodrum, Ku≈üadasƒ± along the coastline, as well as √úrg√ºp in Cappadocia. Alanya is a particularly preferred location for Germans and Scandinavians, while the British purchases are at their highest level of concentration in Fethiye and Didim.Reuters ƒ∞stanbul - in Turkish Controversy The foreign purchase of real estate is a widely discussed subject in the Turkish media and among the public. Some of the opinions put forth in this context may not be based on sound facts, while others are results of in-depth studies.Turkey's territories in the claws of Neoliberalism by the Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects - Chamber of Survey and Cadastre Engineers Turkey's real estate agents have organised themselves to demarcate the definition and the boundaries of their profession and to discourage occasional and non- professional intermediaries. These efforts included professional standards established in 2004. Real estate agents are required to be members (and exhibit their membership) of the association set up for their region. These regional associations are organised within the framework of the national federation, Temfed, which provides a full list of the regional associations. Market data under the new legislation (after 7 January 2006) Information on overseas buyers provided by the First Economic Counsellor of the Turkish Embassy in London for 2006 was as follows:http://www.turkisheconomy.org.uk/news.htm The most recent data provided by the Ministry, covering the period from 2002 (when the incumbent government came into office) to 2008 indicates a total of 63,085 land lots sold to 73,103 foreign private persons, extending to a total area of 25,350,361 square meters. As such, a total of seventy four seventy five thousand foreign nationals own an area of of lands in Turkey. As of 2007, on area basis the provinces of Muƒüla (4,445,259 meter squares), Antalya (3,810,118 meter squares), Aydƒ±n (3,001,075 meter squares) came in the lead. On the basis of the number of foreign nationals acquiring property, the situation was as follows: Antalya (26,031 foreign nationals), Muƒüla (12,865 foreign nationals), ƒ∞stanbul (8,830 foreign nationals), Aydƒ±n (7,415 foreign nationals), Bursa (5,241 foreign nationals), ƒ∞zmir (4,145 foreign nationals). German nationals came the first in Antalya Province and British citizens in Muƒüla and Aydƒ±n Provinces. Purchases by Greek nationals displayed a striking preeminence in ƒ∞stanbul and, in a more recent trend, in Bursa.

History  The name of the village is the modern-day version of Annet's Ford, which was a crossing place over the Seaton Burn which flows eastward through the village. Annitsford borders the villages of Dudley and Fordley, the former taking its name from the son of the mine owner, the latter taking its name from the last part of the village names for Annitsford and Dudley. There is one public house in the village, The Bridge (formerly The Bridge Inn) and it is over 140 years old. It is shown on maps of the village dated 1864, together with the Annitsford Brewery (Annetsford Brewery). This was resited further along the village in later years, and which in later life was a soft drink factory (Dickmans), turning into a transport caf√© circa early 1970s. The premises is now shared by an Indian takeaway (Annitsford Tandoori) and a Fish & Chip shop. The Bridge Inn was for many years in the custodianship of the Swinhoe family, culminating in its massive popularity as a Steak House with a reputation regionwide, throughout the seventies and eighties until the retirement of Gladys & Bill Swinhoe. The fortunes of the pub have not hit those heights since. There are two (CIU) Working Men's Social Clubs in the village, The Pioneer & the United Irish League (The Ranch).  Religion  The village school, Annitsford First School was closed and demolished, eventually making way for a housing development. The same fate fell a number of years earlier to the village's Catholic School and Chapel (Annitsford RC Primary), which was built in 1871. The village has a history of strong Irish Catholic links formed by the immigrant workers who came over in the late 19th century to find work in the nearby mines of Dudley and Weetslade. The Annitsford Roman Catholic Church, St John The Baptist RC Church still stands on the northern edge of the village, but with boundary and road changes, the modern-day person would regard this as being part of the southern edge of Cramlington. In the grounds of the church is buried one of Annitsford's most famous sons, the world-renowned opera singer Owen Brannigan. Descendants of Brannigan's family still live in the village and a street is named after him, Owen Brannigan Drive. Not to be outdone, the Methodists also had their own smaller Chapel which stood at the entrance to the Annitsford Welfare, home for many years to Annitsford Football Club. There is now a local football team called \\"New Fordley Juniors\\".  Expansion  Annitsford was a small village until it grew considerably circa 1969 when the old terraced streets of Jubilee Terrace, Jackson Street and Lee Street were demolished, and the residents moved into new local authority built houses comprising Wardle Drive, Annitsford Drive and Hudson Avenue. In doing so the natural green field boundary keeping Annitsford and Fordley apart disappeared. More housing was built on the land formerly occupied by the terraces and was called Harrison Court, together with the sheltered accommodation development of Jubilee Court. Further housing developments have been built on the west edge of the village (The Wyndings) and the east edge (The Spinney), increasing the overall size of the village considerably. The village is known locally as \\"The Ford\\".

It is located in the region of the former Baltic tribe of Skalvians. It is the capital of Pagƒógiai municipality, and as such it is part of Tauragƒó County. Name The name of the town literally means \\"at Gƒógƒó\\" (: grove of alders, hay meadows, fields) and it is believed that the Gƒógƒó river (also G√§ge, J√§ge) once flowed through the town.  History  =Interwar period= When the Treaty of Versailles came in effect in January 1920, Memelland and the city, located north of the Niemen River were detached from East Prussia and placed under a League of Nations protectorate. In early 1921 attempts for a Customs Union between Memel and Lithuania were adjourned, mainly due to the de facto position of both State and government of Lithuania at that point in the eyes of the Western Allies.Butler/Bury/Lambert, editors, Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939, First Series, vol.xi, HMSO, London, 1961, p.732, telegram 696 where Lord Curzon points out to Lord Harding (Paris) that both the state and the government of Lithuania were at present de facto only. The northern trans- Niemen parts of the East Prussian Kreis Ragnit and both Landkreis and Stadtkreis Tilsit, which had been established in 1818, as well as Gutsbezirk Perwallkischken were combined on 27 January 1920 into a new Kreis Pogegen, with Pogenen as the county town. Achieving formal State recognition, Lithuania, on January 10, 1923, imitating the Polish seizure of Vilna, made a surprise attack upon the Memel territory and city, still under League protection, forcing, with some street fighting, the League's French High Commissioner and his troops there to surrender and evacuate. The Allies and the League of Nations confronted with another fait accompli were forced to accept another humiliation.Powell, E.Alexander, Embattled Borders, London, 1928, p.313-4. Lithuania renamed the Memeland region Pagƒógiai Apskritis. The majority German population in Memel never ceased agitating for a return to Germany of both city and the Memeland, and after conferences between the German & Lithuanian Government representatives in March 1939, an Agreement was reached and signed on March 23 transferring Memel and her territory back to German sovereignty.Watt, Donald Cameron, How War Came, London, 1989, p.156-7. The former name \\"Landkreis Pogegen\\" was resumed. It consisted of 164 Landgemeinden with less than 2,000 inhabitants, and 34 Gutsbezirke. The largest community was Schmalleningken with a pop. of 1,700. Pogegen and the community of Wischwill had 1,400 each. Landkreis Pogegen was dissolved on 1 October 1939 in order to re-unite the area with the larger cities south of Niemen river, and structures similar to pre-1920 were established. = After World War II = Algimantas Mackus gymnasium When Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union for the second time in 1944 and the Subdivisions of Lithuania were changed into that of districts, Pagƒógiai became one of only a few towns that were interwar apskritis capitals which did not become district capitals. When the municipality reform took place in independent Lithuania in 2000, Pagƒógiai municipality was carved out of ≈†ilutƒó district and thus Pagƒógiai became the capital of an administrative unit again. The coat of arms of the town and the municipality depicts a bird with a key, which symbolises the border nature of the area (now with Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia). A Lithuanian border guard unit is stationed in Pagƒógiai.

He is a graduate of Cambridge University and a chartered accountant. In the late 1980s he was part of the senior management team that expanded Weber Shandwick through a major acquisition programme involving the purchase of over 30 public relations agencies worldwide acting as its finance director. In 1992, Love joined the UK Government's Defence Research Agency as Finance Director and continued in the role when the agency expanded into Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). He was appointed Managing Director of the support services division (DSSD) in 1995. Two years later, he led the successful buy-out of DSSD from DERA to form Comax Secure Business Services Ltd. He subsequently led the team which negotiated the sale of Comax to Amey plc. In 2001, Love rejoined DERA as Chief Financial Officer, subsequently playing a key role in the formation of QinetiQ and the sale of a controlling interest to The Carlyle Group. Controversially, his ¬£106,000 investment in the company was later worth ¬£20m at flotation. In 2005, Love became Chief Executive of QinetiQ, as the company moved to IPO. In October 2009, Love resigned his position after an official report into the crash of an ageing British Nimrod Maritime Patrol Aircraft over Afghanistan in 2006, which killed 14 people, found that QinetiQ bore some of the blame for the mistakes that led to the crash. Love then joined LGC as Chairman. He was on the Board of STEMNET (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network) and the Advisory Board of SEMTA (Sector Skills Council for Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies) and is a Senior Adviser at the Chertoff Group (a strategic advisory group focused on security, intelligence and government services).

The film is explicit in its exploration of sexual relationships. It is a co-production between Innocent Pictures and Lars von Trier's Zentropa Productions, and is the third of Zentropa's sex films for women, following Constance (1998) and Pink Prison (1999). All three films were based on the Puzzy Power Manifesto developed by Zentropa in 1997.  Plot  All About Anna tells the story of Anna (Gry Bay), a single woman who seeks to maintain an active sex life while staying clear of emotional involvement, after having been jilted by the love of her life, Johan (Mark Stevens). She has a relationship with Frank (Thomas Raft), but refuses to let him move in with her. When Johan shows up again after five years absence, she starts wondering how much longer she can maintain her emotional independence, and if that is what she wants. She has sex with him, loses his telephone number and cannot contact him. She ends her affair with Frank and when she is offered a job as costume designer in a French theatre, she decides to move to Paris. She leaves her flat to her flatmate Camilla (Eileen Daly) who asks her permission to rent out the now empty room to a friend of hers. This friend turns out to be Johan, and Anna meets him as she leaves for Paris, where the local stage actors Pierre (Morten Schelbech) and Sophie (Ovidie) offer new amorous temptations, but she worries about Johan finding a new love. In the end she returns to Copenhagen and, after mistakenly thinking that Johan has been unfaithful to her, she faces her fears of commitment and is reunited with him.  Release and distribution  The film was originally released in November 2005 on a Scandinavian 3-disc DVD. This was the first Danish pornographic film to be released with subtitles for the hearing-impaired, which was enthusiastically received by the deaf community. The US theatrical premiere was held on January 18, 2007, in Chicago, Illinois, where it was included in the series Cinematic Sexualities in the 21st Century, arranged by Doc Films in collaboration with The University of Chicago Film Studies Center. The two-disc US DVD was released on January 29, 2008. All About Anna was officially selected for Zurich Film Festival and Io Isabella International Film Week. In September 2009, it was released theatrically in the UK as a double bill with Lars von Trier's Antichrist (also a Zentropa-film with sexually explicit images). Reception and awards In 2006 it was nominated for two EroticLine Awards in the categories Best International Newcomer (Gry Bay) and Best International Actor (Mark Stevens). In 2007 it won three Scandinavian Adult Awards, including Best Scandinavian Couples Film, Best Scandinavian Actor (Thomas Raft) and Best Selling Scandinavian Star of 2006 (Gry Bay). In September 2007, Germany's biggest weekly magazine Stern identified women's pornography as one of 50 trends, placed an image from All About Anna on the cover of its cultural supplement Stern Journal, and commented: In her book Secrets of Porn Star Sex (Infinite Ideas, 2007), British author Marcelle Perks includes a chapter on female-friendly porn, in which she concludes: \\"Rather than being intimidated by porn, do a bit of research and find something that you can have fun with. An ideal introduction movie is the hit film All About Anna, a mainstream film that features real sex\\". In April 2008, the U.S. trade journal AVN gave the film an AAAAA Editor's Choice Review. It was one of only four films to receive the journal's highest rating that month.

CCI provided worldwide telephone companies with Directory Assistance (DA) equipment and other systems to automate various operator and telephony services, and later sold a line of 68k-based Unix computers and the Power 6/32 Unix supermini.  History  Computer Consoles Inc. (CCI, incorporated May 20, 1968) was founded by three Xerox employees, Edward H. Nutter, Alfred J. Moretti, and Jeffrey Tai, to develop one of the earliest versions of a smart computer terminal, principally for the telephony market. Raymond J. Hasenauer (Manufacturing), Eiji Miki (Electronic design), Walter Ponivas (Documentation) and James M. Steinke (Mechanical design) joined the company at its inception. Due to the state of the art in electronics at the time, this smart terminal was the size of an average sized office desk. = Automating Operator Services = Due to the success of the smart computer terminal, and the expertise the company gained in understanding Operator Services, the company started development programs to offer networked computer systems that provided contract managed access time, specified as a guaranteed number of seconds to paint the operator's first screen of information, to various telephony databases such as Directory Assistance and Intercept. The largest such system was designed and installed for British Telecom to provide initially Directory Assistance throughout Great Britain and Ireland. These systems combined Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computers with custom hardware and software developed by CCI. = Automatic Voice Response = To provide higher levels of automation to operator services, CCI introduced in the early 1980s various Automatic Voice Response (AVR) systems tightly integrated with its popular Directory Assistance systems. AVR provided voice response of the customer requested data, almost universally starting the prompt with a variant of the phrase, \\"The number is\\". Early systems were based on very small vocabulary synthesised speech chips, follow-on systems utilized 8-bit PCM, and later ADPCM voice playback using audio authored either by CCI or the local phone company. = Digital Switching = To provide even higher levels of automation, CCI started a very aggressive program in the early 1980s to develop a PCM digital telephone switching system targeted for automated, user defined call scenarios. Initial installations handled intercept and calling card calls by capturing Multi-Frequency and DTMF audio band signaling via the DSP based Multi-Frequency Receiver board. Later systems added speaker independent speech recognition via the Quad Digital Audio Processor board to initially automate collect calls. = PERPOS, Perpetual Processing Operating System = To provide better control over transaction processing, significant improvements in fault tolerance, and richer support for networking, CCI developed PERPOS, a Unix derivative that provided integrated support for real-time transaction processing, load balancing, and fault tolerant features such as hot and cold standby. = Power 5 and Power 6 computers = PERPOS was developed for a line of Motorola 68000-based computers called the Power 5 series, which CCI developed. They were a line of multi-processor, fault-tolerant computers, code-named after the Great Lakes. The Power 5 line also included single- processor 68000-based computers, code-named after the Finger Lakes, running a regular Unix port called PERPOS-S, which was originally a Version 7-derived kernel with a System III-derived userland; the kernel was later modified to provide System III compatibility. Later, Computer Consoles opened a development center in Irvine, California, United States, which developed a proprietary minicomputer, competitive with the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX, called the Power 6/32, code-named \\"Tahoe\\" after Lake Tahoe. It ran an internally developed BSD port, and the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California, Berkeley also ported 4.3BSD to it, producing the release known as \\"4.3-Tahoe\\". Unisys corporation remarketed the Power 6 as the U7000 series. Harris Corporation also sold the Power 6 as the HCX-7 and HCX-9. A companion 68010-based machine, the Power 5/32, also ran the internally developed BSD port; it was code-named \\"Walden\\" after Walden Pond. Targeted as a competitor to the Unix/VAX platform, it succeeded for solutions where processing power was paramount. Universities requiring time-shared compilation engines for their students were particularly keen. The machine suffered when applied to general purpose database application environments, not least because the I/O subsystem over-relied on the central processing power (much as the VAX did) and thus used relatively dumb I/O processors. The Power 6 running either version of Unix also suffered from the inefficient memory management inherent in BSD 4.3 [see The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System s. Leffer, Marshall Kirk McKusick, M. Karels, and J. Quarterman]. The core of this was the use of a 512-byte page rather than a 4K-byte page. Leffer et al. suggest they did this due to concerns about VAX support of 4k dynamic paging. The Power 6 had no such problems, but no operating system to support it. The final issue with the Power 6/32 running Unix was the lack for symmetric multiprocessing: All system calls would have to run on the \\"Master\\" processor, forcing a dual processing machine to reschedule a process from the \\"slave\\" processor for every system call. The net result of this meant database benchmarks often ran faster on a single processor than a dual. = Office automation = Due to the success the firm had in network based data management, they partnered with, and ultimately acquired, a small company in Reston, Virginia, called RLG Corporation (named after founder Richard L Gauthier), to develop a terminal-based integrated office automation system. RLG had had experience developing this kind of system for the United States Department of Transportation. The office suite, called OfficePower, provided an integrated set of functions such as word processing, spreadsheet, email, and database access via a compact desktop smart terminal backed by a mini, or super mini-computer. Although the system software was ported to various Unix variants, most installations were hosted on CCI's Power 5 and Power 6 machines running CCI's Unix ports. One installation was at the US Naval Surface Weapons Center in Dahlgren, Virginia; it consisted of two VAXes running 4.2BSD and a number of Power 5/20 machines running PERPOS-S. The VAXes were connected to each other by an Ethernet, but, at the time, it wasn't cost-effective to provide Ethernet adapters on all the Power 5/20 machines. The Power 5/20s were using 3Com's UNET as their TCP/IP implementation; it included an encapsulation scheme for sending IP datagrams over serial lines. Rick Adams implemented this encapsulation scheme as a line discipline for 4.2BSD; this was the origin of SLIP. After the takeover of CCI by Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) (see below), OfficePower was developed as the primary office system for International Computers Limited (ICL), owned by STC, with ports for the ICL DRS range and later servers with Power 6/32, Motorola 68030, Intel x86 and Sun SPARC architectures. It continued to be used widely by ICL customers into the late 1990s.  CCI (Europe) Inc  CCI (Europe) Inc was the wholly owned European Sales, Marketing and Support operation based in West London and established with Richard Levy (Altergo, Wang) as European Vice President, with responsibilities for all business aspects outside of North America. Richard Levy recruited industry professionals to target specific market sectors and distribution channels for the European and International markets for the entire CCI range of computer and telephony products. CCI (Europe) maintained close co-operation with Rochester, NY for the manufacturing, stock & shipping and Irvine, CA for planning & management. Liaising closely with the Israeli R&D; operation for international systems translation, CCI Europe established a solid base in major European accounts and International third-party Distribution channels such as ICL & BT and became an integral aspect of the parent company.  CCI Israel, Inc.  CCI Israel, Inc. was a separately incorporated Delaware corporation however it was closely affiliated with the Rochester, NY, Irvine, CA and Reston, VA operations of Computer Consoles, Inc (CCI). It was first established to manage a telephony project for the Israeli national telephone company, Bezeq. The initial Israeli project was based on products developed in the Rochester-based group. In Israel, development and installation was managed by CCI-Israel's managing director, Jacob \\"Jack\\" Mark. Mr. Mark, was earlier affiliated with the original Bell Labs team to which the core development of the Unix operating system is attributed. The small Ramat Gan-based office later grew to support the efforts of the U.S.-based CCI offices, eventually becoming a major research and development center for machine level/operating systems products, telephony products, office automation products (particularly for British and foreign language \\"OfficePower\\"). CCI Israel also undertook local development projects for major clients - notably Motorola and Israel Aircraft Industries. In the mid-1980s CCI-Israel introduced the U.S. companies' brand of 5/32 and 6/32 micro- and mini-computers to the local Israeli market. CCI-Israel - through seminars and training groups - was also instrumental in developing and popularizing the Unix operating system and the C programming language in Israel. CCI-Israel was also responsible for establishing the first Unix \\"User Group\\" in that country.  Accomplishments  CCI actively participated in various telecom and public standard bodies such as ANSI, and in the development of Unix and the C programming language. It was a pioneer of design and deployment of real-time, transaction processing computer systems, of true fault tolerant computing systems, distributed database access and distributed file system access. CCI was one of earliest commercial entities connected to the Internet as cci.com. CCI deployed the largest multi-processor, shared file-system, Unix based (PERPOS) system of the era in British Telecom in the late 1980s. The design concepts of the system were years ahead of its time. The company was also a pioneer of design and deployment of voice response and speech recognition to the public telephone networks to automate traditional operator based services. CCI controlled over 90% of the world market for equipment to automate telephony Directory services at the time of acquisition by STC.  Acquisition by Standard Telephones and Cables  STC acquired CCI effective January 1, 1989. At this time CCI was organized as two major business units: one in Rochester (\\"CCI - Rochester\\"), which manufactured telecommunications equipment, and a Computer Products Division in Irvine (\\"CCI - Irvine\\"), which manufactured computer hardware. Office systems software was produced at Reston, Virginia. In reality there was a third operation which was a financing group that held the commercial leases for equipment typically sold to telephone companies. At the time of the acquisition the lease base was rumored to be valued at over $700M US dollars. Also at the time of the acquisition, CCI was involved in a dispute with General Telephone and Electronics (\\"GTE\\") over GTE's failure to supply CCI with certain \\"computer chips\\" for a new generation of computers being developed by CCI (the \\"GTE litigation\\"). After completion of the acquisition, CCI - Rochester became a subsidiary of an STC operating unit known as STC Telecom. Shortly thereafter, the Computer Products Division at Irvine and Office Products Centre at Reston were sold to another STC operating unit, ICL,Irvine signs on, STC Gazette February 1990, STC PLC for net book value of the assets. CCI - Rochester was kept under the jurisdiction of STC Telecom, which was also in the telecommunications business.  Acquisition by Northern Telecom Ltd.  STC Telecom was acquired by Northern Telecom effective March 1991 and became part of the company's European operations. Effective January 1, 1992, CCI was transferred to the Northern Telecom U.S. entity, and was eventually merged into this business unit. At that time, CCI was dissolved and Northern Telecom assumed its assets and liabilities.

From 2001 to 2004, Blow wrote the Inner Product column for Game Developer Magazine. He was the primary host of the Experimental Gameplay Workshop each March at the Game Developers Conference, which has become a premier showcase for new ideas in video games. In addition, Blow was a regular participant in the Indie Game Jam. Blow is also a founding partner of the Indie Fund, an angel investor fund for independent game projects. Early life and education Blow was born in 1971. His mother was a devout ex-nun who constantly reminded her scientifically inclined young son about the imminent return of Jesus. (When Blow's older sister came out as a lesbian in the mid-1980s, their mother disowned her.) Blow's father, an aerospace engineer manager, worked all day for the defense contractor TRW, then came home and spent every possible moment alone in his den, where the children were not welcome. Blow would say in an interview with The Atlantic, \\"Early on, I detected that there weren't good examples at home, so I kind of had to figure things out on my own ... I had to adopt a paradigm of self-sufficiency.\\" Blow grew up in La Palma until he was 8, then he moved to Rancho Pe√±asquitos, San Diego, where he attended Mt. Carmel High School. He then studied computer science and creative writing at the University of California, Berkeley and was president of the Computer Science Undergraduate Association for a semester. He left the university in 1994, a semester before he would have graduated.Jonathan Blow: California Dreamin', Hrej.cz (Czech) He worked in San Francisco in contracting jobs, including one with Silicon Graphics to port Doom to a set-top device, until forming the game design company Bolt-Action Software with Bernt Habermeier in 1996. Their initial game project was to be a hovertank-based combat game called Wulfram, but at the time, the video game industry was undergoing a transformation of focusing heavily on three-dimensional graphics, making it difficult for them to complete the project; the team was forced to take some online database work to cover their expenditures. Subsequently, in the wake of the crash of dot-com bubble, they opted to fold the business after four years in 2000, with them $100,000 in debt. Following Bolt-Action, Blow continued to perform contract work for companies like Ion Storm, and writing for industry publications such as Game Developer Magazine. He also worked on a project with IBM to create a technology demo similar to the Wulfram idea that would highlight the features of the Cell processor that IBM was collaborating on, which would become a part of the PlayStation 3. Blow attempted to get additional funding to turn the demo into a full game from both Sony and Electronic Arts but was unsuccessful. Career =Braid= In December 2004, feeling inspired during a trip in Thailand, Blow made a prototype for a time manipulation puzzle platformer game. The demo had crude graphics, but featured the ability of the player to rewind all the objects on screen backwards in time to a previous state. Encouraged by feedback from his peers, Blow worked on the game from about April 2005 to about December that year before having the final prototype of his game, titled Braid. This version won the Independent Games Festival Game Design Award at the 2006 Game Developers Conference. He continued work on the game mostly focusing on art and music while polishing some of the design until its release in 2008 on Xbox Live Arcade. By then, Blow was $40,000 in debt and had invested $200,000 into the game's development. The game was released on August 8, 2008, to critical acclaim and achieved financial success, receiving an aggregate score of 93% on Metacritic, making it the top-rated Xbox Live Arcade game. Braid was purchased by more than 55,000 people during the first week of release. Blow recalled that he did not receive any money until some time later when he suddenly saw \\"a lot of zeroes\\" in his bank account. =The Witness= Announced in August 2009, The Witness is a 3D first person puzzle game in which a player is stranded on an island, trying to solve various maze puzzles. Like Braid before it, Blow invested his own money‚Äîreportedly $2‚Äì3 million. Early public reaction to preview footage resulted in underwhelming assumptions that the game would simply be \\"solving simple maze puzzles.\\" Blow responded by saying that footage does not capture the problem solving process that goes on in the player's mind like in his previous game Braid, and that he \\"wouldn't make a game about solving a series of rote puzzles.\\" In previews of The Witness (often at noisy conventions), Blow had journalists play the game by themselves in a quiet environment so as to fit the tone of the game's design. There was praise of the game's previews, notably Kirk Hamilton from Kotaku calling it \\"an exercise in Symphonic Game Design.\\" Blow reinvested all of his remaining profit from Braid into The Witness, and had to borrow funds when his own ran out. =Jai language= In September 2014, Blow began work on a new programming language called \\"Jai\\" based on ideas he had previously expressed about video game development. It is aimed at \\"low-friction\\" and fluid development, while directly supporting data-oriented design for high performance. The language is currently active, but is a work-in-progress, as no compiler for it has been publicly released yet. A small demo of the language was shown at Reboot Develop 2017. Blow also uses Twitch to regularly stream demonstrations of new language features as well as improvements to the game engine that will be bundled with the language. =Game 3= Blow's next project, tentatively titled Game 3, will be broken into different installments and elaborations on the same game over the course of 20 years, making it bigger and more complex. They will be individual playable games, each related thematically and deepening in investigation of subject matter for each chapter. Blow stated that the game would not be puzzle-related and that it would be built with the Jai language and engine. =Other work= In March 2010, Blow, along with several independent game developers including Ron Carmel and Kellee Santiago, became a founding member of the Indie Fund, an angel investor fund for independent game projects. In 2012, Blow was one of the subjects of the independent documentary film, Indie Game: The Movie, where he discussed his views on the role of independent video games and his work on Braid. Philosophy and views Blow has spoken many times about his views on independent video games both in interviews and in public speeches, although he has said on his blog that he has gotten what he wanted out of conferences from speaking at them. For his sometimes controversial views, he has received praise, notably being called \\"the kind of righteous rebel video games need\\" and \\"a spiritual seeker, questing after truth in an as-yet-uncharted realm.\\" Blow often speaks of the potential for games to be more. He has said that he tries to make games that are more adult for people with longer attention spans and noted that games could have a \\"much bigger role\\" in culture in the future, but current game development does not address this potential, instead aiming for low-risk, high-profit titles. Additionally, formerly being a physics major, Blow has expressed that games could examine the universe in similar ways that a physicist could. In referring to the progression of development in his games, Blow stated at the PlayStation Experience that he prefers to, \\"keep them playable and just make them better.\\" This was stated during the live-cast panel while overseeing Justin Massongill on the playable demo. Blow has spoken out against some games for immoral game design. On World of Warcraft, he has said it causes societal problems by creating a false image of the meaning of life, calling it \\"unethical.\\" On FarmVille, he has said that the design of the game reveals the developers' goal to degrade the quality of players' lives, ultimately calling it \\"inherently evil.\\" Despite Braids success on the platform, Blow has claimed that Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade certification process would turn away developers because \\"they kind of make themselves a pain in the ass\\" and that they would lose market share to Steam as a result. Blow is a member of Giving What We Can, an international organization whose members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to effective charities.

Benjamin's correct surname was Boardley, but since 1859 when the African Repository published an article wrongly spelling Benjamin's surname as Bradley, authors have written about him with the incorrect surname. Early life Benjamin Bradley was born a slave in Anne Arundel County, Maryland in March 1836.The Twelfth Census of the United States (1900) It has been theorized that he acquired literacy while learning from his master's children. According to the Maryland State Manumission records, Bradley's owner was John T. Hammond. As a teenager, Bradley worked at a printing office. He showed ingenuity and mechanical skills by the age of 16, when he built a steam engine out of a gun barrel, pewter, round steel, and other various materials. His master was impressed and was able to get him a job as a helper in the Department of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at the Naval Academy at Annapolis.  Career  At the U.S. Naval Academy, Bradley worked as a helper. According to the African Repository of 1859, he was paid in full for his work, but the money he had made went to his master, who allowed Bradley to keep five dollars a month for himself. As a helper at the academy, Bradley helped set up science experiments that involved chemical gases. It is mentioned that his professors at the Naval Academy were very impressed with him. Professor Hopkins of the Naval Academy wrote about Bradley's work as a helper at the Academy, writing that he would set up experiments, that he was a quick learner and that \\"he looks for the law by which things act.\\" Professor Hopkins's children taught Bradley how to read and write as well as do math (such as arithmetic, algebra and geometry). During his time at the Naval Academy, Bradley built a steam engine and sold it to the a \\"Midshipmen\\". With the money he had made from selling the steam engine and the money that he had saved while working at the Naval Academy, he developed and built a steam engine large enough to run the first \\"cutter of a sloop-of-war\\" that could exceed up to 16 knots an hour. He sold this model engine to another classmate at the Naval Academy and used the proceeds to develop and build the \\"first steam- powered warship.\\" Because he was a slave, Bradley was not allowed to get a patent for the engine he developed. He was, however, able to sell the engine. He used the proceeds, plus the money given to him by professors at the Naval Academy, to buy his freedom for $1,000. According to the Maryland State Manumission records, Bradley was manumitted from his owner, John T. Hammond, on September 30, 1859 in the County of Anne Arundel, Maryland. During the Civil War, the U.S. Naval Academy was relocated to Newport, Rhode Island. According to the African Repository Aug. 1865, Bradley was employed as a freeman at the U.S. Naval Academy in Rhode Island and worked under Prof. A.W. Smith. There Bradley continued his work on constructing small steam engines and continued to show his ingenious mechanical skills. He worked as an instructor in the Philosophical Department at the Naval Academy in 1864. He was credited at designing and constructing a \\"miniature steam-engine and boiler about 6-fly power.\\"  Later life  According to the 1900 U.S. Census, Bradley was 64 years old and living in Mashpee, Massachusetts. His occupation was described as a \\"philosophical lecturer\\". The Census also indicated that he was married to Gertrude Boardley for 19 years, and they had three children together. Death Bradley died in 1897 and is buried at the Mashpee Town Cemetery in Massachusetts.

It has poor absorption when taken by mouth. It is based on rifamycin. Rifaximin was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. In USA it costs US$62.13 per day for 1100 mg of rifaximin ($1,864.00 per month) as of January 2017. In Russia as of 2016 a similar dose costs 231.25 RUB (approximately US$4), Colombia as 2019, 1100mg (2 tabs - 550mg) costs 6286 COP (approximately US $2). Medical uses Rifaximin may be used to treat and prevent traveler's diarrhea. =Irritable bowel syndrome= Rifaximin is approved in the United States for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. It possesses anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties and additionally, it is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that acts locally in the gut. These properties make it efficacious in relieving chronic functional symptoms of non-constipation type irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It appears to retain its therapeutic properties for this indication, even after repeated courses. Rifaximin is particularly indicated where small intestine bacterial overgrowth is suspected of involvement in a person's IBS. Symptom relief or improvement can be obtained for global IBS symptoms including: abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating, and stool consistency. A drawback is that repeated courses may be necessary for relapse of symptoms. There is evidence that rifaximin can be curative in some people with IBS. =C. difficile infection= Rifaximin may also be a useful addition to vancomycin when treating patients with relapsing C. difficile infection. However the quality of evidence of these studies was judged to be low. Although exposure to rifamycins in the past may increase risk for resistance, so rifaximin should be avoided in such cases. =Hepatic encephalopathy= In the United States, rifaximin has orphan drug status for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Although high-quality evidence is still lacking, rifaximin appears to be as effective as or more effective than other available treatments for hepatic encephalopathy (such as lactulose), is better tolerated, and may work faster. Free full text with registration at Medscape. Rifaximin is taken by mouth. It has minimal side effects, prevents reoccurring encephalopathy, and is associated with high patient satisfaction. People are more compliant and satisfied to take this medication than any other due to minimal side effects, prolonged remission, and overall cost. It reduces the levels of intestinal ammonia-producing bacteria thus alleviating the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy and reducing mortality. The drawbacks to rifaximin are increased cost and lack of robust clinical trials for HE without combination lactulose therapy. =Other uses= Other uses include treatment of: infectious diarrhea, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and diverticular disease. Rifaximin is effective in treating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth regardless of whether it is associated with irritable bowel syndrome or not. Rifaximin has also shown efficacy with rosacea, ocular rosacea which also presents as dry eyes for patients with co- occurrence with SIBO.https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(12)02330-4/fulltext Special caution Cautious use is required in individuals with cirrhosis of the liver who have a Child-Pugh score of class C severity. Side effects Rifaximin has few side effects. Side effects are generally mild and uncommon; this is largely because very little of the drug is absorbed from the gut meaning systemic side effects are absent. Clostridium difficile infection does not typically result from rifaximin therapy unless risk factors such as immunosuppression and hospitalisation are present. Rifaximin is active against Clostridium difficile.  Interactions  Rifaximin is not significantly absorbed from the gut and therefore does not have much significant interactions with other drugs in people with normal liver function. Pharmacology Rifaximin is a semisynthetic broad spectrum antibacterial drug, that has very low bioavailability due to its poor absorption after oral administration. Because of this local action within the gut and the lack of horizontal transfer of resistant genes the development of bacterial resistance is rare. Because of this poor absorption, most of the drug taken orally stays in the gastrointestinal tract where the infection takes place. However, due to drug polymorphisms and differences between crystalline and amorphous forms of the compounds, certain generic drug versions are more readily absorbable than the original brand name version. =Mechanism of action= Rifaximin interferes with transcription by binding to the Œ≤-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase. This results in the blockage of the translocation step that normally follows the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, which occurs in the transcription process. This in turn results in a reduction of bacteria populations, including gas producing bacteria, which may reduce mucosal inflammation, epithelial dysfunction and visceral hypersensitivity. Rifaximin has broad spectrum antibacterial properties against both gram positive and gram negative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. As a result of bile acid solubility, its antibacterial action is limited mostly to the small intestine and less so the colon. A resetting of the bacteria composition has also been suggested as a possible mechanism of action for relief of IBS symptoms. Additionally, rifaximin may have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on gut mucosa via modulation of the pregnane X receptor. Other mechanisms for its therapeutic properties include inhibition of bacterial translocation across the epithelial lining of the intestine, inhibition of adherence of bacteria to the epithelial cells and a reduction in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Availability In the United States, Salix Pharmaceuticals holds a US Patent for rifaximin and markets the drug under the name Xifaxan. In addition to receiving FDA approval for traveler's diarrhea and (marketing approved for) hepatic encephalopathy, rifaximin received FDA approval for IBS in May 2015. No generic formulation is available in the US and none has appeared due to the fact that the FDA approval process was ongoing. If rifaximin receives full FDA approval for hepatic encephalopathy it is likely that Salix will maintain marketing exclusivity and be protected from generic formulations until March 24, 2017. In 2018, a patent dispute with Teva was settled which delayed a generic in the United States, with the patent set to expire in 2029. Rifaximin is approved in 33 countries for GI disorders. On August 13, 2013, Health Canada issued a Notice of Compliance to Salix Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the drug product Zaxine. In India it is available under the brand names Ciboz and Xifapill. In Russia and Ukraine the drug is sold under the name Alfa Normix (–ê–ª—å—Ñ–∞ –ù–æ—Ä–º–∏–∫—Å), produced by Alfa Wassermann S.p.A (Italy). In 2018, the FDA approved a similar drug by Cosmos Pharmaceuticals called Aemcolo for traveler's diarrhea.

Some of these writers state that Alexander the Great withdrew from the Indian subcontinent because of the strong war elephant force of the Gangaridai. The writers variously mention the Gangaridai as a distinct tribe, or a nation within a larger kingdom (presumably the Nanda Empire). A number of modern scholars locate Gangaridai in the Ganges Delta of the Bengal region, although alternative theories also exist. Gange or Ganges, the capital of the Gangaridai (according to Ptolemy), has been identified with several sites in the region, including Chandraketugarh and Wari-Bateshwar.  Names  The Greek writers use the names \\"Gandaridae\\" (Diodorus), \\"Gandaritae\\", and \\"Gandridae\\" (Plutarch) to describe these people. The ancient Latin writers use the name \\"Gangaridae\\", a term that seems to have been coined by the 1st century poet Virgil. Some modern etymologies of the word Gangaridai split it as \\"Ga·πÖgƒÅ-rƒÅ·π£·π≠ra\\", \\"Ga·πÖgƒÅ-rƒÅ·∏çha\\" or \\"Ga·πÖgƒÅ-h·πõdaya\\". However, D. C. Sircar believes that the word is simply the plural form of \\"Gangarid\\" (derived from the base \\"Ganga\\"), and means \\"Ganga (Ganges) people\\".  Greek accounts  Several ancient Greek writers mention Gangaridai, but their accounts are largely based on hearsay. = Diodorus = Diodorus Siculus as depicted in a 19th-century fresco The earliest surviving description of Gangaridai appears in Bibliotheca historica of the 1st century BCE writer Diodorus Siculus. This account is based on a now-lost work, probably the writings of either Megasthenes or Hieronymus of Cardia. In Book 2 of Bibliotheca historica, Diodorus states that \\"Gandaridae\\" (i.e. Gangaridai) territory was located to the east of the Ganges river, which was 30 stades wide. He mentions that no foreign enemy had ever conquered Gandaridae, because it of its strong elephant force. He further states that Alexander the Great advanced up to Ganges after subjugating other Indians, but decided to retreat when he heard that the Gandaridae had 4,000 elephants. In Book 17 of Bibliotheca historica, Diodorus once again describes the \\"Gandaridae\\", and states that Alexander had to retreat after his soldiers refused to take an expedition against the Gandaridae. The book (17.91.1) also mentions that a nephew of Porus fled to the land of the Gandaridae, although C. Bradford Welles translates the name of this land as \\"Gandara\\". In Book 18 of Bibliotheca historica, Diodorus describes India as a large kingdom comprising several nations, the largest of which was \\"Tyndaridae\\" (which seems to be a scribal error for \\"Gandaridae\\"). He further states that a river separated this nation from their neighbouring territory; this 30-stadia wide river was the greatest river in this region of India (Diodorus does not mention the name of the river in this book). He goes on to mention that Alexander did not campaign against this nation, because they had a large number of elephants. The Book 18 description is as follows: Diodorus' account of India in the Book 2 is based on Indica, a book written by the 4th century BCE writer Megasthenes, who actually visited India. Megasthenes' Indica is now lost, although it has been reconstructed from the writings of Diodorus and other later writers. J. W. McCrindle (1877) attributed Diodorus' Book 2 passage about the Gangaridai to Megasthenes in his reconstruction of Indica. However, according to A. B. Bosworth (1996), Diodorus' source for the information about the Gangaridai was Hieronymus of Cardia (354‚Äì250 BCE), who was a contemporary of Alexander and the main source of information for Diodorus' Book 18. Bosworth points out that Diodorus describes Ganges as 30 stadia wide; but it is well-attested by other sources that Megasthenes described the median (or minimum) width of Ganges as 100 stadia. This suggests that Diodorus obtained the information about the Gandaridae from another source, and appended it to Megasthenes' description of India in Book 2. = Plutarch = Plutarch Plutarch (46-120 CE) mentions the Gangaridai as \\"'Gandaritae\\" (in Parallel Lives - Life of Alexander 62.3) and as \\"Gandridae\\" (in Moralia 327b.). = Other writers = A modern map identifying the places depicted in the Periplous of the Erythraean Sea Ptolemy (2nd century CE), in his Geography, states that the Gangaridae occupied \\"all the region about the mouths of the Ganges\\". He names a city called Gange as their capital. This suggests that Gange was the name of a city, derived from the name of the river. Based on the city's name, the Greek writers used the word \\"Gangaridai\\" to describe the local people. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea does not mention the Gangaridai, but attests the existence of a city that the Greco-Romans described as \\"Ganges\\": Dionysius Periegetes (2nd-3rd century CE) mentions \\"Gargaridae\\" located near the \\"gold-bearing Hypanis\\" (Beas) river. \\"Gargaridae\\" is sometimes believed to be a variant of \\"Gangaridae\\", but another theory identifies it with Gandhari people. A. B. Bosworth dismisses Dionysius' account as \\"a farrago of nonsense\\", noting that he inaccurately describes the Hypanis river as flowing down into the Gangetic plain. Gangaridai also finds a mention in Greek mythology. In Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica (3rd century BCE), Datis, a chieftain, leader of the Gangaridae who was in the army of Perses III, fought against Aeetes during the Colchian civil war. Colchis was situated in modern-day Georgia, on the east of the Black Sea. Aeetes was the famous king of Colchia against whom Jason and the Argonauts undertook their expedition in search of the \\"Golden Fleece\\". Perses III was the brother of Aeetes and king of the Taurian tribe.  Latin accounts  The Roman poet Virgil speaks of the valour of the Gangaridae in his Georgics (c. 29 BCE). Quintus Curtius Rufus (possibly 1st century CE) noted the two nations Gangaridae and Prasii: Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 CE) states:  Identification  The Wari-Bateshwar ruins of present-day Bangladesh have been identified as a part of Gangaridai. Archaeologists have considered it as the ancient trading hub of Sounagoura mentioned by Claudius Ptolemy Archaeologists have considered Chandraketugarh of present-day Indian state West Bengal as the ancient city of Gange, the capital of Gangaridai The ancient Greek writers provide vague information about the centre of the Gangaridai power. But according to claudius Ptolemy capital of gangaridai is situated at kumar river of Bangladesh.the later historians have put lforward various theories about its location. = Gangetic plains = Pliny (1st century CE) in his NH, terms the Gangaridai as the novisima gens (nearest people) of the Ganges river. It cannot be determined from his writings whether he means \\"nearest to the mouth\\" or \\"nearest to the headwaters\\". But the later writer Ptolemy (2nd century CE), in his Geography, explicitly locates the Gangaridai near the mouths of the Ganges. A. B. Bosworth notes that the ancient Latin writers almost always use the word \\"Gangaridae\\" to define the people, and associate them with the Prasii people. According to Megasthenes, who actually lived in India, the Prasii people lived near the Ganges. Besides, Pliny explicitly mentions that the Gangaridae lived beside the Ganges, naming their capital as Pertalis. All these evidences suggest that the Gangaridae lived in the Gangetic plains.  Rarh region  Diodorus (1st century BCE) states that the Ganges river formed the eastern boundary of the Gangaridai. Based on Diodorus's writings and the identification of Ganges with BhƒÅgirathi-Hooghly (a western distributary of Ganges), Gangaridai can be identified with the Rarh region in West Bengal.  Larger part of Bengal  The Rarh is located to the west of the BhƒÅgirathi-Hooghly (Ganges) river. However, Plutarch (1st century CE), Curtius (possibly 1st century CE) and Solinus (3rd century CE), suggest that Gangaridai was located on the eastern banks of the Gangaridai river. Historian R. C. Majumdar theorized that the earlier historians like Diodorus used the word Ganga for the Padma River (an eastern distributary of Ganges). Pliny names five mouths of the Ganges river, and states that the Gangaridai occupied the entire region about these mouths. He names five mouths of Ganges as Kambyson, Mega, Kamberikon, Pseudostomon and Antebole. These exact present-day locations of these mouths cannot be determined with certainty because of the changing river courses. According to D. C. Sircar, the region encompassing these mouths appears to be the region lying between the BhƒÅgirathi-Hooghly River in the west and the Padma River in the east. This suggests that the Gangaridai territory included the coastal region of present-day West Bengal and Bangladesh, up to the Padma river in the east. Gaurishankar De and Subhradip De believe that the five mouths may refer to the Bidyadhari, Jamuna and other branches of BhƒÅgirathi-Hooghly at the entrance of Bay of Bengal. According to the archaeologist Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, the centre of the Gangaridai power was located in vicinity of Adi Ganga (a now dried-up flow of the Hooghly river). Chakrabarti considers Chandraketugarh as the strongest candidate for the centre, followed by Mandirtala. James Wise believed that Kotalipara in present-day Bangladesh was the capital of Gangaridai. Archaeologist Habibullah Pathan identified the Wari-Bateshwar ruins as the Gangaridai territory. = North-western India = William Woodthorpe Tarn (1948) identifies the \\"Gandaridae\\" mentioned by Diodorus with the people of Gandhara. Historian T. R. Robinson (1993) locates the Gangaridai to the immediately east of the Beas River, in the Punjab region. According to him, the unnamed river described in Diodorus' Book 18 is Beas (Hyphasis); Diodorus misinterpreted his source, and incompetently combined it with other material from Megasthenes, erroneously naming the river as Ganges in Book 2. Robinson identified the Gandaridae with the ancient Yaudheyas. A. B. Bosworth (1996) rejects this theory, pointing out that Diodorus describes the unnamed river in Book 18 as the greatest river in the region. But Beas is not the largest river in its region. Even if one excludes the territory captured by Alexander in \\"the region\\" (thus excluding the Indus River), the largest river in the region is Chenab (Acesines). Robison argues that Diodorus describes the unnamed river as \\"the greatest river in its own immediate area\\", but Bosworth believes that this interpretation is not supported by Diodorus's wording. Bosworth also notes that Yaudheyas were an autonomous confederation, and do not match the ancient descriptions that describe Gandaridae as part of a strong kingdom. = Other = According to Nitish K. Sengupta, it is possible that the term \\"Gangaridai\\" refers to the whole of northern India from the Beas River to the western part of Bengal. Pliny mentions the Gangaridae and the Calingae (Kalinga) together. One interpretation based on this reading suggests that Gangaridae and the Calingae were part of the Kalinga tribe, which spread into the Ganges delta. N. K. Sahu of Utkal University identifies Gangaridae as the northern part of Kalinga.  Political status  Diodorus mentions Gangaridai and Prasii as one nation, naming Xandramas as the king of this nation. Diodorus calls them \\"two nations under one king.\\" Historian A. B. Bosworth believes that this is a reference to the Nanda dynasty, and the Nanda territory matches the ancient descriptions of kingdom in which the Gangaridae were located. According to Nitish K. Sengupta, it is possible that Gangaridai and Prasii are actually two different names of the same people, or closely allied people. However, this cannot be said with certainty. Historian Hemchandra Ray Chowdhury writes: \\"It may reasonably be inferred from the statements of the Greek and Latin writers that about the time of Alexander's invasion, the Gangaridai were a very powerful nation, and either formed a dual monarchy with the Pasioi [Prasii], or were closely associated with them on equal terms in a common cause against the foreign invader.Chowdhury, The History of Bengal Volume I, p. 44.

Carey, Henry F., ed. Romania since 1989: politics, economics, and society. Lexington Books: Oxford. Pages 507-510. This event occurred several weeks after the FSN achieved a landslide victory in the May 1990 general election, the first elections after the fall of the Ceau≈üescu regime. Many of the miners, factory workers, and other anti- protester groups, fought with the protesters and bystanders. The violence resulted in some deaths and many injuries on both sides of the confrontations. Official figures listed seven fatalities and hundreds of injured, although media estimates of the number killed and injured varied widely and were often much higher. Background The initial enthusiasm after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 was tempered in January 1990, after the National Salvation Front (Frontul SalvƒÉrii Na»õionale, FSN), an organization that emerged as the leader during the anti-Ceau»ôescu revolution, decided to run as a party in the elections it was set to organize. Further discontent was brought by the fact that many of the FSN leaders, including its president, Ion Iliescu, were former members of the Romanian Communist Party. When the 1989 Revolution occurred, the Communist Party had a membership of 4 million out of a population of 22 million. The newly founded parties that opposed the FSN organised, beginning with April, large electoral meetings in University Square. Students and professors at the University of Bucharest also joined in the protests. One of their most vocal demands was the voting into law of the eighth demand of the Proclamation of Timi»ôoara, which stated that communists should be prevented from holding official functions. Iliescu dubbed the protesters as golani (rascals) or huligani (hooligans), and implied fascists groups participated in the protest in an attempt to seize power. The protesters eventually adopted the name golani and the movement came to be known as the Golaniad. After Iliescu and the FSN won a landslide victory in the elections of May 20, 1990, the opposition parties decided to disband the meeting. Only a small part of the protesters remained in the square, where they set up tents. After several weeks, the government decided to forcefully evacuate the remaining protesters, but the police attempts were met with violence, and several state institutions, including the police headquarters, the national television station, and the Foreign Ministry, were attacked. President Iliescu issued a call to Romania's population to come to Bucharest in order to save the \\"besieged democratic regime\\" and restore order and democracy in Bucharest. The most important group to answer the call were the powerful miner's organizations from the Jiu Valley. Some 10,000 miners were transported to Bucharest in special trains. Prelude On 22 April, the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Partidul Na»õional »öƒÉrƒÉnesc Cre»ôtin »ôi Democrat, PN»öCD, now the Christian-Democratic People's Party) and other parties organised a demonstration in Aviators' Square. After the peaceful demonstration, groups of people marched towards the Romanian Television (TVR) station, calling for its political independence. They continued their protest in University Square and decided to sit in overnight. Two days later, they were still there, their numbers growing. They stated that they would not leave the Square, dubbing their protest \\"the big anti-communism protest\\". Their main demands were the adoption of point 8 of the Proclamation of Timi≈üoara (no former members of the disbanded Romanian Communist Party in the new government), the political independence of TVR, and inquiries about the truth of the Revolution. The Geology Faculty's balcony became the stage for almost a month of protest. The opposition decided to abandon protests after FSN's victory in the May elections. On 11 June, negotiations between the government and the remaining demonstrators failed. About 100 people, dissatisfied with the result of the dialogue between the government and the hunger strikers, started rioting in Victoria Square (Pia»õa Victoriei) and closed in on Victoria Palace (Palatul Victoriei, the government's headquarters). Police, military police and army forces appeared, together with some armoured personnel carriers. The police pushed the demonstrators back to Calea Victoriei and retreated towards the Palace. 13 June 04:00: The police forces attacked the hunger strikers. Tents were ripped up and destroyed, and personal objects were confiscated. Strikers were arrested, but some escaped and took refuge in the hall of the InterContinental Hotel. 05:00: Police attacked the Architecture Institute (Institutul de ArhitecturƒÉ), surrounded the Square and built barricades out of vehicles. The representatives of the Police Press Bureau declared that they didn't know what was happening in the city centre. 9:30: Demonstrators appeared around the barricade built between Col»õea Hospital and \\"LuceafƒÉrul\\" Cinema and started chanting anti-government protests. Many arrests took place. 11:00: The number of arrests was made public by radio: about 240. At the Architecture Faculty (Facultatea de ArhitecturƒÉ) there was a press conference of students and hunger strikers who were attacked but had managed to evade arrest. 12:00: The Architecture Institute was assaulted by a group of workers from the Bucharest's industrial platforms, shouting: \\"I.M.G.B. makes the law!\\". Another group, mostly of women, shouted: \\"I.C.T.B. makes the law!\\", brandishing makeshift weapons. The students barricaded themselves, but the building was assaulted. The police showed up. Other groups shouted anti-governmental slogans and split apart the two groups of workers. 14:00: From the Academiei and Col»õei streets protesters launch Molotov cocktails. In the area in the vicinity of the University, Architecture Institute and the Negoiu Hotel, the crowd shouted and booed. The police appeared, but withdrew because people were throwing bottles and rocks from the rooftops. 17:30: The demonstrators smashed the police barrage and reach the balcony. More policemen appeared, but were forced to withdraw under the heavy \\"artillery barrage\\" of rocks and bottles. An explosion set fire to the police bus that blocked the entry to the square. The police left and the square was occupied. At the truck barricade on One»ôti street a bus was set on fire. At the balcony of the Geology College (Facultatea de Geologie), Marian Munteanu, head of the Student League from the University of Bucharest, announced that the students were on strike and would barricade themselves in the building until their arrested colleagues were released. Shortly thereafter, the main HQs of the Bucharest Police, Interior Minister and SRI were attacked. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails, started fires, conducted various acts of violence, destroyed documents and objects, and took people hostage. There were rumours that trains full of miners were heading for Bucharest. Ion Iliescu addressed the public, urging them to oppose the violent acts and do everything they could to re-establish order. 18:00: Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the Television yard, although the zone was guarded by police and civilians. Protesters armed with clubs and other improvised weapons went to the entrance to Pangratti Street. Violence ensued and broadcasting was interrupted. In the Television building, the film archive was destroyed, along with IBM subtitle machines, montage rooms and mobile phones. Telephone wires were cut, documents were stolen or destroyed, windows were broken and people were violently attacked. 14 June In the early morning, coal miners from the Jiu Valley reached Bucharest on trains, along with their leader Miron Cozma. They headed for Victoria Square, where they were welcomed and bread was distributed to them from army vehicles. A number of officials appeared at the Council of Ministers at Victoria Square, and finally Iliescu showed up accompanied by representatives of the miners. In his speech he accused the demonstrators of the University Square of being alcoholics, drug addicts, fascists (making reference to the Iron Guard \\"Legionnaires\\" of the World War II era), and bandits. In the square were also groups carrying banners showing that they are from particular factories. During this period, the Opposition newspapers and magazines Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, Dreptatea, Express, 22, Baricada were attacked and damaged, and some of the newspaper workers were assaulted. The building where Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ was printed was damaged. Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ and several publications of opposition political groups were not published in the interval of 15‚Äì18 June, as the typography workers refused to print the anti-government articles. The student demonstrators and protesters were engaged in violent confrontation with workers and other pro-government groups. The University and Architecture Institute was devastated and many students badly beaten. From 14‚Äì15 June arrests of the people involved in the demonstration of University Square continued.  Casualties  The number of victims is controversial. Officially, according to the evidence from the parliamentary commissions of inquiry, the number of wounded is 746, and the death toll is six: four dead by shooting, one dead of a heart attack and a person stabbed. Viorel Ene, president of the Association of Victims of the Mineriads, asserted that \\"there are documents, testimonies of doctors, of people from Domne»ôti and StrƒÉule»ôti cemeteries. Although we have said all along that the real number of dead is over 100, no one contradicted so far and there was no official position against.\\" The opposition newspaper Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ alleged that over 128 unidentified bodies were buried in a common grave in StrƒÉule»ôti II cemetery, near Bucharest. A few weeks after the mineriad, several medical students conducted research in StrƒÉule»ôti II cemetery, discovering two trenches with about 78 unmarked graves, which they claimed to contain victims of the events. There were also other people ‚Äì journalists, photographers, students ‚Äì who have carried out research and photographs at the Institute of Forensic Medicine and StrƒÉule»ôti Cemetery. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1990, under the signature of Eugen Dichiseanu, Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ published, in a series of 10 episodes, a survey on the subject. The research, conducted by journalist Eugen Dichiseanu and members of the League of Students, including George Roncea, claimed to have found major irregularities, inaccuracies, negligencies, deficiencies of organization, but also attempts of default of evidence in the functioning of institutions involved in managing the situation of dead without identity: Police, Prosecution, Institute of Forensic Medicine (IFM), Bucharest City Hall. Aftermath According to the report of Gheorge Robu and Interior Minister Doru Viorel Ursu, from the events of 13‚Äì15 June 185 people were arrested; 34 put on trial; 2 freed unconditionally; 17 freed under parole after medical examinations; 81 freed under parole; 51 remained under arrest. The demonstrations in University Square persisted until about 24‚Äì25 August 1990. Press reaction The pro-FSN press (such as AdevƒÉrul, Diminea≈£a, Azi) praised the miners and other workers for being the \\"defenders of liberty and democracy\\" and criticized the negative coverage of the international press who, they claim, saw only one part of the issue. The official government position on the foreign press opinion was expressed on 15 June 1990 by Prime Minister Petre Roman. He declared that the international press had a \\"strange\\" point of view and that the intervention against the opposition was not a \\"fascist program\\", but it was the other way around, the protesters being the fascists. Differing perspective of the miners See also The 1990s: the rise and decline of miners' unions The Jiu Valley miners were vilified in the national and international press for their role in the confrontation and the subsequent violence and destruction. Subsequent interviews with miners participating in the confrontation provide a very different perspective of the events that transpired. Many claim that individuals reportedly representing the government came to the mines and union groups and told the miners that the new democracy was under attack by anarchists and provocateurs who wanted to bring down the elected government. It was their duty, the miners were told, to protect Romania and the new democracy. Few, if any, of the miners had any connection with or knowledge of the protesters and their demands, so they followed the direction of individuals they believed represented the government. In the view of many individuals in Jiu Valley, most of the violence was perpetuated by non-miners or agents provocateurs dressed like miners. The perspective that the Bucharest-controlled media refused to provide their version of events was and continues to be widely held throughout the Jiu Valley., History of Jiu Valley - Jiu Valley Portal, January 1. 2005 Inquiry into potential involvement of the Romanian Intelligence Service Later inquiries would show that these claims by the miners were not unfounded. Rumors and public suspicion (and later Parliamentary inquiries) of the potential role of the Serviciul Rom√¢n de Informa≈£ii (Romanian Intelligence Service), the successor to the former Securitate), in the instigation and manipulation of the June 1990 Mineriad contributed to the widespread public mistrust of the post-Ceau≈üescu Romanian intelligence service. Government inquiries would show that the miners had indeed been \\"joined by vigilantes who were later credibly identified as former officers of the Securitate\\", and that for two days, the miners had been aided and abetted by former Securitate members in their violent confrontation with the protesters and other targets. Baleanu, V. G. The Enemy Within: The Romanian Intelligence Service in Transition. January 1995. Conflict Studies Research Centre, The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst: Camberley, Surrey GU15 4PQ. In February 1994 a Bucharest court \\"found two security officers, Colonel Ion. Nicolae and warrant officer Corneliu Dumitrescu, guilty of ransacking the house of Ion Ra»õiu, a leading figure in the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, during the miners‚Äô incursion, and stealing $100,000.\\" In addition to accusations of having agents infiltrate and incite the opposition rally on 18 February 1990 and later directly participate in the June 1990 anti-opposition violence involving the Jiu Valley miners, there was also evidence that during this period that the Service was involved in distributing fake Legionary leaflets that claimed a fascist take-over in Romania was about to occur, and evidence that intelligence officials selectively released documents from Securitate archives in order to compromise opposition leaders. According to a research report put out by the Conflict Studies Research Centre at Britain's Royal Military Academy Sandhurst: > Despite repeated denials by its leaders, there are clear indications of the > SRI's involvement. Recently, Voican Voiculescu even accused Magureanu of > having staged the violence in order to take over as prime minister.

Plot It is 1824 as Beethoven (Ed Harris) is finishing his Ninth Symphony. He is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma. A new copyist, Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger) is engaged to help the composer finish preparing the score of his symphony for the first performance. Anna is a young conservatory student and aspiring composer. Her understanding of his work is such that she corrects mistakes he has made, while her personality opens a door into his private world. Beethoven is initially skeptical, but he slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows to rely on her and view her with respect, and even with admiration. Anna Holtz (as Beethoven always refers to her) is sent to be his copyist, but due to her gender, is constantly thought less of, and is mistaken for a serving girl, maid, and even prostitute. Pushing past, though quite unhappily, from these assumptions, Anna proves herself to Beethoven, not only as a copyist, but also as his friend, and something of his prot√©g√© and heir as far as he is concerned. He gains much admiration of her, after she assists him by directing him, hidden among his musicians, as he simultaneously copies her movements to direct the orchestra during what would turn out to be his final concert. Though Anna agreed to her romantic interest, Martin Bauer, that she would help him complete his symphony, and then immediately leave after showing him her work, she instead continues to assist him as his copyist. After seeing the admiration she has gained from Beethoven, Anna proceeds to show him a piece of music that she composed. Beethoven tactlessly and unknowingly insults her. Anna, more than ready not to return, continues to stay with her great aunt and the nuns at the convent. Anna is surprised when Beethoven, desperate to keep Anna in his employment and under his tutelage, bursts into the convent and begs Anna, on his knees, to come back and work as his equal on both of their music. He begins to teach her about Romanticism, music, and mostly, how to allow her artistic side freedom. Continuing his infuriating behavior, Beethoven smashes the model of Martin's bridge he built for an engineer's competition, thereby ruining Martin as well. Anna, angry, confronts Beethoven, asking him if he had ever considered that she loved Martin. Beethoven replies, \\"You don't love him.\\" Upon hearing this, Anna angrily asks if she is supposed to love Beethoven instead. Beethoven again replies, \\"No. You want to be me.\\" From here, Anna agrees that Beethoven did the right thing, and continues to work with him, pushing him past his hardships and failures, and then staying by his bedside until he died. The movie ends though, with Anna finally embracing herself as an artist, unique from all other composers, including Beethoven, and readying herself for a promising future. Though the film is directed very abstractly, leaving room for the audience to view Anna and Beethoven's relationship as that of a chaste romance, the characters remain very platonic, and could much more easily be viewed as a strong and close friendship, bordering on Beethoven even being viewed as a father figure of Anna's. Cast *Ed Harris as Ludwig van Beethoven *Diane Kruger as Anna Holtz *Matthew Goode as Martin Bauer *Phyllida Law as Mother Canisius *Joe Anderson as Karl van Beethoven *Ralph Riach as Wenzel Schlemmer *Bill Stewart as Rudy Artistic license The working manuscript of the score of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is attributed to two copyists, both of whom were male, not a single female as depicted in the film. The character of Anna Holtz is likely based at least partially on Karl Holtz, a young violinist and copyist who befriended Beethoven during the final few years of the composer's life and is said to have influenced decisions on pieces such as the Gro√üe Fuge. Critical reception The film received a score of 59/100 on Metacritic and 28% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with average score 4.76/10, based on 81 reviews.

Early life Hale was previously a professional footballer for Bury, Blackburn Rovers, York City and Shrewsbury Town. Career While editor of the Bury Messenger in the early 1980s, he says Barbara Castle, then the local Member of the European Parliament gave him confidential information on political figures who appeared sympathetic to the Paedophile Information Exchange and indicated that several high ranking senior politicians were also allegedly involved in promoting a Westminster paedophile circle. After refusing pressure to hand over the dossier put on him by Cyril Smith MP and Special Branch not to publish it, his office was then raided by SB officers and the papers were confiscated with the threat of prison. Bakewell murder He was later editor of the Matlock Mercury, where he became involved in the campaign to overturn the murder conviction of Stephen Downing. In 1973, Downing, at the time a 17-year-old with the reading age of an 11-year-old, was imprisoned for the murder of Wendy Sewell and served 27 years in jail. Following his six-year campaign, the conviction was eventually quashed and declared unsafe by the Court of Appeal in 2001 and Downing was released. =In Denial of Murder changes= Hale's work on the case eventually helped to force a change in both European and British law, allowing any prisoner, particularly in denial of murder (IDOM) and/or convicted of any serious offence, to be allowed to appeal for parole consideration directly to the Parole Board. Downing's case was one of three test cases originally presented to the European Court of Human Rights by barrister Edward Fitzgerald. After several years of debate and despite a late appeal from the British Government, the case went in Downing's favour and he received ¬£500 in compensation. When the murder conviction was later quashed, Downing also received over ¬£900,000 in compensation. Hale's book about the Stephen Downing appeal case, Town Without Pity, became a best-seller. It was adapted into a BBC TV drama starring Stephen Tompkinson and Caroline Catz called In Denial of Murder. In 2016 Judge Robert Rinder featured Hale's book and his quest for justice within a one-hour special on ITV 1 for Judge Rinder's Crime series. The show was repeated in July 2018. Taking part were Hale, Stephen Downing and a cold case detective Chris Clark, who believes Wendy Sewell, the victim in the Bakewell murder, for which Downing was eventually cleared, may have been another victim of the notorious Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe. =Awards= Hale was voted 2001 Man of the Year by The Observer newspaper, Journalist of the Year by What the Papers Say and was made an OBE for his efforts and campaigning journalism. He has also been national journalist of the year on three occasions, and his campaign to free Stephen Downing won the national campaign of the year award. Further controversies Hale has also been heavily involved in the controversial case of Barry George, jailed for life for the murder of BBC TV star Jill Dando. Hale also played a key role in investigating and helping to free former police officer Graham Huckerby who was wrongly jailed for allegedly being part of a major bullion robbery gang. Both prisoners eventually had their convictions quashed. During 2013, Hale began investigating an alleged miscarriage of justice for ex-Sheffield United footballer Ched Evans, who was convicted of the rape of a teenage girl in Rhyl and sentenced to five years in jail. Hale has helped present fresh evidence to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on behalf and in support of the family's claim that the police inquiry was flawed, and that much of the evidence that could have helped his defence, was not presented at trial. Evans was routinely released from prison on licence in October 2014 and evidence sent to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. On 6 October 2015, they announced that they were referring the case back to the Court of Appeal, where he was later acquitted. Evans faced a retrial in Oct 2016 and the jury took three hours to return a 12-0 verdict of not guilty. Books After a short spell working for the North Wales Pioneer newspaper, Hale became editor of the newly formed North Wales Living magazine in 2005. He won a succession of prestigious awards but later left to pursue other interests. During the autumn of 2007, his book about the famous frogman \\"Buster\\" Crabb spy mystery, called The Final Dive, was published by Suttons/The History Press. Hale has also had published Secrets of the Royal Detective about his great-grandfather, James Wood, a notable Manchester detective from 1890 to 1914, who was also the first Royal Protection Officer acting as a personal bodyguard to the Prince of Wales, following the death of Queen Victoria. Hale's book, Mallard - How the Blue Streak broke the World Speed Record, also became a popular best seller and was first released in paperback by Aurum Press in May 2008 to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the speed record for steam locomotives held by LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard. The book was reprinted and published in July 2013 as a specially updated version for the 75th anniversary of Mallard breaking the world speed record on 3 July 1938, by publishers Aurum Press. An updated book was officially re-launched at the NRM in York on 3 July 2013 as part of the Great Gathering commemorations. Hale also produced and published a new railway history book - Mallard, the Railway Marvel that Beat the World in July 2018 to help commemorate the 80th anniversary of Mallard winning the world speed record. Hale has written several other books, including a crime novel titled The Wrong Body and non-fiction works such as The Child Killers, Sounds of the Sixties - Club 60 & the Esquire, Birth of the British Bobby, The World of Dreams, Joe Cocker and the Clubs, Sherlock Holmes and the Ghost Ship Mystery.

The principle underlies the modern international system of sovereign states and is enshrined in the United Nations Charter, which states that, ‚Äúnothing [...] shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.‚Äù According to the idea, every state, no matter how large or small, has an equal right to sovereignty. Political scientists have traced the concept to the Peace of Westphalia (1648), which ended the Thirty Years' War. The principle of non- interference was further developed in the 18th century. The Westphalian system reached its peak in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it has faced recent challenges from advocates of humanitarian intervention.  Principles and criticism  A series of treaties make up the Peace of Westphalia, which is considered by political scientists to be the beginning of the modern international system, Here: p. 251.Jackson, R.H.; P. Owens (2005) \\"The Evolution of World Society\\" in: John Baylis; Steve Smith (eds.). The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 53. . in which external powers should avoid interfering in another country's domestic affairs. The backdrop of this was the previously held idea that Europe was supposed to be under the umbrella of a single Christian protectorate or empire; governed spiritually by the Pope, and temporally by one rightful emperor, such as that of the Holy Roman Empire. The then-emerging Reformation had undermined this as Protestant- controlled states were less willing to respect the \\"supra authority\\" of both the Catholic Church and the Catholic-Habsburg led Emperor. Recent scholarship has argued that the Westphalian treaties actually had little to do with the principles with which they are often associated: sovereignty, non- intervention, and the legal equality of states. For example, Andreas Osiander writes that \\"[t]he treaties confirm neither [France's or Sweden's] 'sovereignty' nor anybody else's; least of all do they contain anything about sovereignty as a principle.\\"Osiander, op. cit., p. 267. For a different view, see D. Philpott, Revolutions in Sovereignty (2001). Others, such as Christoph Kampann and Johannes Paulmann, argue that the 1648 treaties in fact limited the sovereignty of numerous states within the Holy Roman Empire and that the Westphalian treaties did not present a coherent new state-system, although they were part of an ongoing change. Yet others, often post-colonialist scholars, point out the limited relevance of the 1648 system to the histories and state systems in the non-Western world.O. Ozavci, 'Bursting the Bubbles: On the Peace of Westphalia and the Happiness of Unlearning', https://securing- europe.wp.hum.uu.nl/bursting-the-bubbles-on-the-peace-of-westphalia-and-the- happiness-of-unlearning/ Nonetheless, \\"Westphalian sovereignty\\" continues to be used as a shorthand for the basic legal principles underlying the modern state system. The applicability and relevance of these principles have been questioned since the mid-20th century onward from a variety of viewpoints. Much of the debate has turned on the ideas of internationalism and globalization, which some say conflict with Westphalian sovereignty.  History  The ratification of the Treaty of M√ºnster, part of the Peace of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years' War. The origins of Westphalian sovereignty have been traced in the scholarly literature to the Peace of Westphalia (1648). The peace treaties put an end to the Thirty Years' War, a war of religion that devastated Germany and killed 30% of its population. Since neither the Catholics nor the Protestants had won a clear victory, the peace settlement established a status quo order in which states would refrain from interfering in each other's religious practices. Henry Kissinger wrote: The principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs was laid out in the mid-18th century by Swiss jurist Emer de Vattel. States became the primary institutional agents in an interstate system of relations. The Peace of Westphalia is said to have ended attempts to impose supranational authority on European states. The \\"Westphalian\\" doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th-century thoughts of nationalism, under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to nations‚Äîgroups of people united by language and culture. The Westphalian system reached its peak in the late 19th century. Although practical considerations still led powerful states to seek to influence the affairs of others, forcible intervention by one country in the domestic affairs of another was less frequent between 1850 and 1900 than in most previous and subsequent periods.Leurdijk, 1986 After the end of the Cold War, the United States and Western Europe began talking of a post-Westphalian order in which countries could intervene against human rights abuses in other countries. Critics have pointed out such intervention would be (and has been) used to continue processes similar to standard Euro-American colonialism, and that the colonial powers always used ideas similar to \\"humanitarian intervention\\" to justify colonialism, slavery, and similar practices. China and Russia have thus used their United Nations Security Council veto power to block what they see as American actions to violate the sovereignty of other nations.  Challenges to Westphalia  The end of the Cold War saw increased international integration and, arguably, the erosion of Westphalian sovereignty. Much of the literature was primarily concerned with criticizing realist models of international politics in which the notion of the state as a unitary agent is taken as axiomatic.Camilleri and Falk, The End of Sovereignty?, 1992. In 1998, at a Symposium on the Continuing Political Relevance of the Peace of Westphalia, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said that \\"humanity and democracy [were] two principles essentially irrelevant to the original Westphalian order\\" and levied a criticism that \\"the Westphalian system had its limits. For one, the principle of sovereignty it relied on also produced the basis for rivalry, not community of states; exclusion, not integration.\\" In 1999, British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave a speech in Chicago where he \\"set out a new, post-Westphalian, 'doctrine of the international community. Blair argued that globalization had made the Westphalian approach anachronistic.Bellamy, Alex, and Williams, Paul, Understanding Peacekeeping, Polity Press 2010, p. 37 Blair was later referred to by The Daily Telegraph as \\"the man who ushered in the post-Westphalian era\\". Others have also asserted that globalization has superseded the Westphalian system. In 2000, Germany's Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer referred to the Peace of Westphalia in his Humboldt Speech, which argued that the system of European politics set up by Westphalia was obsolete: \\"The core of the concept of Europe after 1945 was and still is a rejection of the European balance-of-power principle and the hegemonic ambitions of individual states that had emerged following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, a rejection which took the form of closer meshing of vital interests and the transfer of nation-state sovereign rights to supranational European institutions.\\" The European Union's concept of shared sovereignty is also somewhat contrary to historical views of Westphalian sovereignty, as it provides for external agents to influence and interfere in the internal affairs of its member countries. In a 2008 article Phil Williams links the rise of terrorism and violent non-state actors (VNSAs), which pose a threat to the Westphalian sovereignty of the state, to globalization. = Military intervention = Interventions such as in Cambodia by Vietnam (the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War) or in Bangladesh (then a part of Pakistan) by India (the Bangladesh Liberation War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971) were seen by some as examples of humanitarian intervention, although their basis in international law is debatable.Michael Akehurst, \\"Humanitarian Intervention\\", in H. Bull, ed., Intervention in World Politics, Oxford University Press, 1984. Other more recent interventions, and their attendant infringements of state sovereignty, also have prompted debates about their legality and motivations. A new notion of contingent sovereignty seems to be emerging, but it has not yet reached the point of international legitimacy. Neoconservatism in particular has developed this line of thinking further, asserting that a lack of democracy may foreshadow future humanitarian crises, or that democracy itself constitutes a human right, and therefore states not respecting democratic principles open themselves up to just war by other countries. However, proponents of this theory have been accused of being concerned about democracy, human rights and humanitarian crises only in countries where American global dominance is challenged, while hypocritically ignoring the same issues in other countries friendlier to the United States. Further criticism of Westphalian sovereignty arises regarding allegedly failed states, of which Afghanistan (before the 2001 US-led invasion) is often considered an example.Robert I. Rotberg. \\"The new nature of nation‚Äêstate failure\\". The Washington Quarterly, Volume 25, Issue 3, 2002 In this case, it is argued that no sovereignty exists and that international intervention is justified on humanitarian grounds and by the threats posed by failed states to neighboring countries and the world as a whole. Political scientist Hall Gardner has challenged elements of the Westphalian sovereignty.Hall Gardner, IR Theory, Historical Analogy, and Major Power War (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) Reviewer Sarang Shidore summarizes Gardner's argument: :the standard interpretation of the Peace of Westphalia, the 1648 treaty that is widely seen to have inaugurated a new era in European and world affairs, by reifying state sovereignty as a global governing principle. Westphalian sovereignty, Gardner argues, is substantially a myth. While Westphalia did put aspects of state sovereignty in place, such as the right of almost three hundred German princes to be free of the control of the Holy Roman Empire, it also limited sovereignty in important ways, for instance, by ‚Äúdenying the doctrine of cuius regio, eius religio (the religion of the prince becomes the religion of the state) ... established by the 1555 Peace of Augsburg‚Äù (p. 118). Rather than a strict enshrining of the principle of noninterference, Westphalia legitimized ‚Äúpower sharing and joint sovereignty‚Äù by giving the new powers France and Sweden the right to interfere in the affairs of the German Protestant princes (p. 117). Another example of power sharing was the recognition of Switzerland as a confederal state.Sarang Shidore, \\"Shidore on Gardner, 'IR Theory, Historical Analogy, and Major Power War'\\" in H-Diplo (September, 2019)  Defenders of Westphalia  Although the Westphalian system developed in early modern Europe, its staunchest defenders can now be found in the non-Western world. The presidents of China and Russia issued a joint statement in 2001 vowing to \\"counter attempts to undermine the fundamental norms of the international law with the help of concepts such as 'humanitarian intervention' and 'limited sovereignty. China and Russia have used their United Nations Security Council veto power to block what they see as American violations of state sovereignty in Syria. Russia was left out of the original Westphalian system in 1648, but post-Soviet Russia has seen Westphalian sovereignty as a means to balance American power by encouraging a multipolar world order. Some in the West also speak favorably of the Westphalian state. American political scientist Stephen Walt urged U.S. President Donald Trump to return to Westphalian principles, calling it a \\"sensible course\\" for American foreign policy. American political commentator Pat Buchanan has also spoken in favor of the traditional nation-state.

Mid-Ocean as part of Unwin's Christmas Annual.The Broken Shaft: Tales of Mid-Ocean (ed. H. Norman), Unwin‚Äôs Christmas Annual, London: T. Fisher Unwin, December 1885 The story was later published in Stevenson's collection The Merry Men and Other Tales and Fables (1887).  Plot summary  The story opens late one Christmas Day in an antique store, presumably in London during the mid 1880s. A man named Markheim has come even though the store is officially closed, and the rather shady dealer points out that whenever he comes to visit after hours, it is usually to privately sell a rare item, claiming it to be from a late uncle's collection he inherited. The dealer hints his suspicions that more likely Markheim stole these items, although it has not stopped him from purchasing them, usually for an amount less than what his client asked for. Markheim visibly flinches at the dealer's not-so-subtle insinuations, but claims that he has not come to sell anything this time, but rather to buy a Christmas present for a woman he will soon marry, implying she is well off. Though somewhat incredulous, the dealer suggests a mirror as a gift, but Markheim takes fright at his own reflection, claiming that no man wants to see what a mirror shows him. Markheim seems strangely reluctant to end the transaction, but when the dealer insists that his visitor must buy or leave, Markheim consents to review more goods. However, when the dealer turns his back to select another item, Markheim pulls out a knife and stabs him to death. Surrounded by mirrors and ominously ticking clocks, and with only a candle to light up the dark shop, Markheim spends some minutes recovering his nerve when he hears someone moving about upstairs, though he knows the dealer's maidservant has taken the day off and no one should be there. He reassures himself that the outer door is locked, searches the dealer's body for keys and then goes to the upper rooms where the dealer lived to look for money, which he intends to use to start a business. As he searches for the right key to open the dealer's safe, he hears footsteps on the stairs, and a man opens the door and asks, \\"Did you call me?\\" Markheim believes the stranger is the Devil. Though he never identifies himself, the stranger is clearly supernatural; he says that he has watched Markheim his whole life. He tells Markheim that the servant is returning to the store early, so Markheim had best hurry or face the consequences. He also offers to show Markheim the right key to open the safe, although he predicts that Markheim's business will not be successful. Indeed, the stranger clearly knows that much of Markheim's life has been unsuccessful, consisting of gambling and petty theft. Instead of continuing to loot the house, Markheim tries to justify his life and conduct to the stranger, entering into a discussion of the nature of good and evil. The stranger refutes him on every point, and Markheim is at last obliged to admit that he has thrown his life away and turned to evil. The servant returns, and as she knocks on the door the stranger advises Markheim that he can entice her in by telling her that her master is hurt, then kill her and have the whole night to ransack the house. Markheim retorts that while he has lost the love of good, he still hates evil. The face of the stranger undergoes a \\"wonderful and lovely change\\", full of \\"tender triumph\\", as he disappears. Markheim opens the door and tells the servant to call the police, for he has killed her master.

His son was Pierre Trudeau, 15th Prime Minister of Canada, and his grandson is Justin Trudeau, 23rd and current Prime Minister of Canada. Life and career Charles-√âmile Trudeau was born on his family's farm in Saint-Michel-de-Napierville, Quebec, the son of Joseph Trudeau (1848-1919),Memoirs, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 1993 a semi-literate farmer, and Malvina Cardinal (1849-1931), whose own father was Solime Cardinal (1815-1897), mayor of Saint-Constant, Quebec. Malvina insisted that her sons be given a strong education; her husband agreed to send them to College Sainte-Marie. Trudeau later studied law at the Laval University's campus in Montreal, which in 1919 became the University of Montreal. After a ten-year courtship, he married Grace Elliott (1890-1973), the daughter of a prominent Scots-Quebecer entrepreneur, Philip Armstrong Elliott (1859-1936), and his wife Sarah Sauv√© (1857-1899), on May 11, 1915 in Montreal at the original Saint-Louis-de-France Roman Catholic Church on Roy Street at Laval Avenue, which was later destroyed by fire in 1933. They would have four children, their first child dying at birth. Charles-√âmile Trudeau was considered gregarious, boisterous, and extravagant. Trudeau, a lawyer by training, practised for 10 years with Ernest Bertrand, at that time the senior Crown prosecutor, as well as with Charles E. Gu√©rin. Trudeau accumulated a fortune by building gas stations around the Montreal area and a loyalty program known as the Automobile Owners' Association, which by 1932 had 15,000 members patronizing Trudeau's 30 stations. He sold his business to Champlain Oil Products Limited for $1 million, while remaining with Champlain as general manager for that subsidiary. Among his other investments, Trudeau had interests in mining companies. He was a noted baseball enthusiast: he was the largest shareholder and member of the board of directors of the Montreal Royals baseball team, and the team's vice-president at the time of his death. He was also vice president of Montreal's Belmont Park and a prominent philanthropist, including as a benefactor of the H√¥pital Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc, for which he also served as director at the time of his death.The General Star at www.jdgravenor.com Politically, Trudeau was a strong supporter of the Conservative Party, opposed to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, a long-serving Liberal.Trudeau, Pierre Elliott. Memoirs, McClelland & Stewart Inc., 1993, p. 184. Pierre Trudeau would recall that \\"political arguments never lacked liveliness\\" between Charles and his friends.Trudeau, p. 10. Death and legacy He died of a heart attack in 1935 in Orlando, Florida, while on the road with the Royals, and was laid to rest at his family vault in St-R√©mi-de-Napierville Cemetery. Due to Trudeau's business, Pierre Trudeau himself inherited wealth. Trudeau served as an inspiration to the future prime minister. As Jim Coutts, Pierre Trudeau's aide, recalled, Trudeau \\"talked, at times, of his father, whom he greatly admired, but who was too busy to understand his son's interests or spend much time with him.\\"Jim Coutts, \\"Trudeau in Power: A View from Inside the Prime Minister's Office,\\" in Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, eds.

It currently consists of five bands plus a training wing - the Royal Marines School of Music at HMS Nelson - and its headquarters is at HMS Excellent, Whale Island, Portsmouth. History See also: History of the Royal Marines The development of music in the Royal Marines is inextricably linked with the evolution of British military bands. Lively airs and the beat of the drum enabled columns of marching men to keep a regular step. The drum was the normal method of giving signals on the battlefield or in camp. As long ago as the days of Drake and Hawkins the drummer's rhythm would advertise the changing watches or beat the men to quarters. Royal Marine Drummers were first mentioned in the 1664 Convening Order, at the formation of Corps and so pride themselves as being the oldest Branch in the Corps. Without doubt, groups of musicians existed in the Service before 1767, when Royal Marines Divisional Bands were formed at the naval dockyard-bases of Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth and the naval gathering- point of Deal in the Downs, and Marine bands (along with professional bands paid for by captains) plus their respective corps of drums provided music on board ships before and during battles of the Napoleonic Wars (e.g. during the long sail into action at the Battle of Trafalgar). The modern history of the Service, though, begins late in the 19th century, when the task of forming a Royal Naval School of Music to provide Bands for the Royal Navy was assigned to the Marines, with the school being founded in 1903. From then on the Band Service became an integral part of the Corps. Its original home was Eastney Barracks, Portsmouth; where it remained until 1930 when it was transferred to the Royal Marine Depot, Deal. Second World War By the end of the Second World War, 225 musicians and buglers had been killed in action, which was a quarter of their strength at the time, and the highest percentage of any branch of any service, after Bomber Command. After the outbreak of the Second World War, the service moved to Malvern, then divided with the Junior Wing moving to the Isle of Man and the Senior Wing to Scarborough. Post Second World War The bands reunited at Burford in 1946 and finally returning to Deal in 1950. The amalgamation of the Divisional Bands with the Royal Naval School of Music to form today's Royal Marines Band Service, also took place in 1950 when the headquarters and training establishment were renamed the Royal Marines School of Music. The Band Service are notable for performing the theme music from Gerry Anderson's successful 1965 TV series Thunderbirds, in the final scene from his 1966 film Thunderbirds Are Go. The band performed the music on the parade ground of the Royal Marines Depot, Deal, where they marched under the leadership of their Senior Drum Major Charles H. Bowden. This sequence was synchronized with the end credits of the film, with the very last scene of this shot (and indeed, the whole film) showing the band standing in a large representation of the words 'THE END'. Deal bombing At approximately 8.20 am on 22 September 1989, the Royal Marines School of Music at the Royal Marine Depot, Deal was bombed by the IRA; this resulted in the death of eleven Royal Marines Musicians - Musn Mick Ball, B/Cpl John (Andy) Cleatheroe, B/Cpl Trevor Davis, Musn Richard Fice, Musn Richard (Taff) Jones, B/Cpl Dave McMillan, Musn Chris Nolan, B/Cpl Dean Pavey, Musn Mark Petch, Musn Tim Reeves and Musn Bob Simmonds plus the injury of 22 other Royal Marine Band Service members. A memorial garden is now situated in the grounds of the old barracks where the bomb went off. This was built in remembrance of the eleven who died and was restored after an arson attack some years later. Every year the families and friends of those that died join together at the garden to pay their respects and lay flowers in a memorial service. The Bandstand near the Walmer Lifeboat station is also dedicated to those who lost their lives in the bombing, with the names of those killed engraved on each face. Each July a Royal Marines Band returns to perform an outdoor concert in it. Modern era Buglers in greatcoats during the 2015 Remembrance Day Service at the Cenotaph, London. In 1992 the band was opened to women when the Royal Navy began to fully integrate women (who were then members of a separate branch) into the service. In April 1996, the School of Music was moved to Portsmouth dockyard when the Deal Barracks were closed. It was initially housed at the former Royal Naval Detention Quarters ‚Äî the cells were converted to individual practice rooms.The Royal Marines School of Music Band of HM Royal Marines HMS Collingwood were present on the Isle of Man for the Tynwald Day ceremony on Monday 6 July 2015. The Bands of HM Royal Marines participate in various annual events such as the Royal British Legion's Festival of Remembrance, the Remembrance Day Service at the Cenotaph, the Lord Mayor's Show as well as accompanying Royal Navy and Royal Marines contingents at guard mounting duties in London. Furthermore, the Massed Bands, numbering some two hundred musicians from normally at least three Royal Marines bands, perform their Beating Retreat ceremony every two years at London's Horse Guards Parade in celebration of the birthday of their Captain General. Because of its popularity, it is generally over three nights. The most recent events were in June 2012 in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, in June 2014 in honour of the RM's 350 years of service to the nation and also the first to feature a guard of honour company from 40 Commando Brigade and bands from the United States Marine Corps and the Netherlands Marine Corps, and in June 2016, also marking the 90th birthday of HM the Queen and the first to be streamed live on Facebook. The latest event was slated for a May 2018 date, marking the 65th anniversary of the 1953 Coronation of HM the Queen and will be followed by another in 2020, marking the 75th diamond jubilee since the conclusion of the Second World War and the 70th anniversary of the current Band Service. Another event hosted by the Royal Marines Band Service is the Mountbatten Festival of Music, named after former Life Colonel Commandant Royal Marines Admiral of the Fleet The Earl Mountbatten of Burma, which takes place every year in the Royal Albert Hall. Present organisation Royal Marines Band in Jersey, 2010.

Officers and Bandmasters  World Band Festival Luzern in 2012 All Directors of Music are Commissioned Officers, who are commissioned from within the ranks of the RMBS (there are no direct entry officers in the RMBS), on completion of the 12 month Bandmasters' Course (at RMSoM in Portsmouth) and once they have passed the external LRSM directing exam. Once commissioned they attend a music college for a period of one to two years, to study advanced conducting; usually at the level of MMus. Officers in command of Bands are either a Captain or Major, with the senior position of Principal Director of Music being a Lieutenant Colonel. Each Band also has a Warrant Officer Class 2 Bandmaster who acts as the Band Manager and deputy conductor. There are also four Warrant Officer Class 1 Bandmasters, in positions such as Bandmaster/Chief Instructor at the School of Music and PRO. The senior Bandmaster is a WO1 who holds the appointment of 'Corps Bandmaster' and is the chief non-commissioned advisor to the Principal Director of Music on all matters music and personnel.  Corps of Drums  The bands are always led by 'buglers', who are trained on both the side drum and the bugle as well as the Herald Fanfare Trumpet (natural trumpet); this section of the band is referred to as \\"the Corps of Drums\\", which since 1903 is now situated at the front of the band. Whilst similar to army corps of drums, these are members of the Royal Marines Band Service, although they retain their own rank structure. RM Buglers have a similar history to Army 'drummers' in that they were used to convey orders on a ship on drums and bugles, and would then mass onshore into corps of drums, though they were still expected to work as individual soldiers,Fact Sheet - The Drums of the RM also known in slang by the Royal Navy as drummers. These drummer-buglers trace themselves back to the raising of the Royal Marines in 1664 as a maritime foot regiment, with six drummers attached to its battalions. Today's buglers carry out duties ranging from repatriation services (sounding Last Post bugle call), mess beatings (drum displays), beating retreat (marching displays) and concerts on behalf of the Royal Marines and the entire Royal Navy. The Corps of Drums from the Band of HM Royal Marines Collingwood performing a drum display during the 2019 London summit. = Instruments and leadership = Like the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the principal instrument of the corps of drums; with the bugle being another core instrument. Bass drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Bass drummers, cymbalists and tenor drummers on parade however, are for the most time percussionist, not buglers. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as the principal player for it. = Drum major = A drum major holds the rank of Sergeant Bugler, Colour Sergeant Bugler, or warrant officer class 2. \\"Drum Major\\" is not a rank itself but an appointment. The Corps Drum Major RM, the most senior drum major in the Royal Marines, holds the rank of warrant officer class 1. Drum majors in the Royal Marines are now always drawn from the buglers branch and always started their careers as a bugler and are required to have passed a number of courses in music, military skills, and leadership throughout their military careers before being considered for an appointment as a drum major. He is responsible for band ceremony, discipline and administration. The insignia of appointment is four point-up chevrons worn on a wrist-strap whilst in shirt-sleeve order, or four large point-up chevrons worn on the uniform sleeve, surmounted by a drum. Royal Marines drum majors do not wear any additional badges to indicate specific rank. In addition to the drum major sash, the uniform features hussar style braiding across the front of the tunic. = Bugle major = During the 1850s the bugle became the main means of signalling and Bugle Majors were appointed to assist the Drum Major. Initially the Royal Marine Artillery had a Trumpet Major but this appointment was replaced by Bugle Major when the artillery trumpet was superseded by the bugle. However, RMA Buglers continued to wear the crossed trumpets badge on their sleeve. During this period the RMA was unique in having a Divisional bugle-call and a Divisional trumpet-call. During 1922, Drum Major and Bugle Major appointments were confirmed at Colour- Sergeant rank with one of each at all Divisions and the Depot, Deal. The Bugle Major was instructed to further assist the Drum Major whilst retaining responsibility for instruction in fife and bugle. They both had the status and pay of Sergeant from 1810. In 1881 they became Staff Sergeant and were entitled to wear a sword, which they still retain. The Bugle Major, who wears the narrow red welt of the Buglers Branch, is responsible for the military side drum, bugle and herald trumpet training of buglers. The Corps Bugle Major is an appointment for the most senior bugle major in the Royal Marines, typically holding the rank of warrant officer class 2. The insignia of appointment is four point-up chevron worn on a wrist-strap whilst in shirt- sleeve order, or four large point-up chevrons worn on the uniform sleeve, surmounted by a bugle.

The Royal Marines ranking structure is used, with \\"band\\" prefixed to the rank (e.g. Band Corporal, abbreviated BdCpl); as with other bands of the British Armed Forces, the rank of Private is replaced with Musician. The term \\"bugler\\" suffixed are used for members from the corps of drums (e.g. Corporal Bugler, abbreviated Cpl Bugler). They wear the same badges of rank as other Royal Marines but wear a \\"Royal Marines Band Service\\" badge in place of the commando flash and other Band Service insignia indicating their status as musicians. Members also wear the navy blue beret with a scarlet patch behind the badge, that is also worn by other personnel who have not passed the commando course.

In 1930 it moved to Deal, Kent, a historic Royal Navy base and shipyard. Between 1940 and 1950, it moved to various locations around the country before returning to Deal. Eleven band members at the school were killed during the Deal barracks bombing of 1989. The school relocated for the last time in 1996 and returned to Portsmouth, making its home in the former detention quarters within HMS \\"Nelson\\"Coming Home - The History of the Royal Marines School of Music Today all Royal Marines Bands are required to provide every imaginable musical ensemble including wind bands, orchestras, quartets and dance bands, as well as traditional Military (parade) Bands. To achieve this, all RM musicians, except solo specialists, are required to attain an above-average standard on both a string and a wind instrument. As a result of this special versatility, Royal Marines musicians are recognised around the world as being both thoroughly professional and highly talented within the military musical world, and the music world generally. The \\"Solo Specialists\\" have to become exceptionally highly talented on their chosen single instrument. The Corps of Drums receive an equally thorough training and pride themselves on maintaining the highest standards of drill, bugling and drumming. Their glittering presence at the front of all Royal Marines Bands on the march gives the bands a visual impact that is second to none. After completing 15 weeks of initial military training, now mostly held at the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines, and passing the audition, musicians proceed to train at the RMSoM. Musicians train for a maximum of 3 years and buglers train for 2 years. RMSoM has a collabrotive agreement with Plymouth University through which musicians may obtain a BMus degree. More experienced musicians have an opportunity to obtain a master's degree and other civilian certifications through external providers. As their careers progress, Musicians and Buglers may return to the Royal Marines School of Music to undergo further musical training to qualify them for higher rank, after passing the Junior Command Course (to become Band Corporal) and Senior Command Course (to become Band Sergeant). This culminates in a possible place on the Bandmasters' Course that is widely recognized as one of the most demanding courses of its type, lasting 12 months. Bandmaster Students study all the main music disciplines; the orchestral and contemporary wind band repertoire and they work with renowned figures from the world of music.  Military role  Members of the Royal Marines Band Service during medical training. Also visible is the \\"Royal Marines Band Service\\" badge worn in place of the \\"Royal Marines Commando\\" flash, on the shoulder. In addition to music making, Royal Marines Musicians and Buglers are fully trained and operational military personnel and usually perform support duties such as medical support, driving ambulances and logistics. Additionally they may also provide entertainment for troops deployed overseas and represent the Royal Marines in an ambassadorial role. Band members have traditionally been deployed on board Royal Navy ships and this custom continued until 1978. Bandsmen saw action during both the First and Second World Wars. By the end of World War II, 225 musicians and buglers had been killed in action, which was a quarter of their strength at the time, and the highest percentage of any branch of any service. Royal Marines Bands were also involved in both the Falklands War and Operation Granby (the 1991 Gulf War) as casualty handlers on various hospital ships. In 2000, RM Band Service ranks deployed to Kosovo for six months during Operation Agricola supporting 3 Commando Brigade RM. During the firefighters' strike (Operation Fresco) in 2002-03, 150 Band Service ranks were deployed with 'Green Goddesses' to various Temporary Service Fire Stations around the UK. Despite this, the annual Mountbatten Festival of Music went ahead in 2003 although with very reduced numbers. In the early part of 2003, 39 Band Service ranks deployed with the Primary Casualty Receiving Facility on RFA Argus providing casualty handlers and a further 26 ranks deployed with 3 Commando Brigade as decontamination teams during Operation Telic (the Iraq War). Sunday 1 April 2007 marked a significant milestone for the Royal Marines Band Service as they took over the duties as the Cyprus Reinforcement Unit for two months. Ninety ranks deployed. This was the first time in the history of the Royal Marines Band Service that Musicians and Buglers had been deployed in company strength as an independent military unit to perform their secondary role. Also in 2006/2007 (Operation Herrick V, Operation Herrick order of battle), two Royal Marine Buglers took part in operations in Afghanistan with 3 Commando Brigade where they assisted the Medical Squadron of the Commando Logistic Regiment, as well as providing musical support for repatriation ceremonies. Another 38 deployed to Afghanistan again in 2008/9 with 3 Commando Brigade as ambulance and general duties drivers. Royal Marines Bands continue to fly the flag abroad with many prestigious engagements undertaken including the 60th Anniversary of D-Day, in Gibraltar, the USA, Europe and Australia. Band members train in CBRN defense casualty treatment. In 2018 they participated in the annual chemical warfare exercise on Salisbury Plain involving over 300 military personnel, along with 40 Commando, the RAF Regiment and the Defence CBRN Centre. Royal Naval Volunteer Bands HMS Seahawk Volunteer Band at the 2016 Royal Navy Volunteer Band Association Festival at the Portsmouth Guildhall The Royal Naval Volunteer Bands are not part of the RMBS, these bands are assigned in various Royal Navy installations all over the UK and are staffed by a wide variety of volunteer Military Musicians. They come from many walks of life: serving or retired members of any of the Crown Services, retired military Bandsmen or civilian personnel who wish to help and support the Armed Forces. It is a uniformed organisation wearing a \\"rig\\" similar to a Royal Naval Senior Rating, or the uniform of their parent service. Bands are run by a Volunteer Band Instructor, the conductor of the Band, in charge of Music and a Volunteer Band Officer, a member who is serving above the rank of Warrant Officer.

Its main catchment area is the town of Selby and villages from the Selby District, including Thorpe Willoughby, Hambleton, Monk Fryston, Cawood and Wistow. History Selby High School links back to Selby Grammar School, founded in 1908 as an all-girls school as Selby High School. In 1967 this changed to the Selby Grammar School grammar school and became coeducational, and in 1979, a mixed comprehensive school. The comprehensive was renamed Selby High School. Buildings In 2003 Selby High School began fundraising towards securing specialist school status - the school was awarded specialist status in Performing and Visual Arts in 2005. Following this the school built a dance studio, a 200-seat theatre stand and an all-weather pitch. In January 2013 the school added an ICT suite with new computers. In 2017 it added the Eckersley Centre, A building named after the previous headmaster, Paul Eckersley. House system In 2005 the school introduced a new house system with pupils from all year groups equally distributed into forms. The houses are named after significant Yorkshire people: Lesley Garrett (Garrett); David Hockney (Hockney); James Mason (Mason); and Michael Palin (Palin).

The Rowbike was invented by Scott Olson, the creator of Rollerblade inline skates. \\"Rowling\\" is a combination of rowing and rolling and is sometimes used in place of rowing when describing a Rowbike. Unlike traditional bicycles where power is supplied primarily by the rider's legs turning pedals connected to the drive wheel through a looped chain, a Rowbike delivers power through a swinging lever that moves a chain back and forth over the rear cog in a reciprocating motion regulated by a bungee cord. The rowing lever is large enough that a rider will normally utilize muscles from their legs, arms, back and abdomen to maintain a steady rowing motion to keep the Rowbike in motion. Rowbikes are marketed as providing a full body workout through the rowing motion which is gentle on the rider's knees, hips and back due to the system being non-load bearing. Though Rowbike is primarily marketed as a fitness machine, as a rowing cycle it may also be classified as a human powered vehicle, as opposed to a stationary indoor rowers. In the United States, Rowbikes are almost exclusively for exercise and fitness, rather than for transportation. Four wheel variants also exist. As with most bicycles, a stationary bike converter stand can be obtained from a third-party vendor to allow the Rowbike to be effectively used as an indoor rower.  Terminology  While many Rowbike parts are standard bicycle parts, several are patented and proprietary to the Rowbike, and can only be obtained from the manufacturer.2006 RowBike assembly manual *shock cord ‚Äì A bungee cord with a loop at one end that attaches to a standard bicycle chain with a removable link. It is placed inside the power lever and normally not visible unless the lever is pulled back. The other end of the cord is knotted to prevent slipping. The cord is prone to fatigue over time and must be replaced every few years. *power lever ‚Äì a long swinging handlebar with grips and handbrakes that the rider pulls back on to provide propulsion. It is often blue, regardless of the color of the rest of the frame. It may also be called the swing arm. *Dave Cam ‚Äì Also called the D Cam, it is the pulley at the end of the power lever. *Seat Wing ‚Äì a pair of brackets with three rollers (or 6 rollers in all) that the seat is mounted on that allow the seat assembly to slide back and forth as the rider rows. Riding over rough and uneven pavement causes the rollers, which function as de facto shock absorbers, to wear out rapidly. To minimize the risk of being ejected from the seat after hitting a large bump, the rollers should be replaced regularly. Propulsion and steering Steering, braking, shifting, and propulsion are accomplished through the handlebars. The brakes and brake levers are standard bicycle components. The handle bars are specific to the Rowbike and cannot be upgraded, although standard grips, bar ends, and other accessories can be mounted on them. The front fork is controlled (or steered) with cables in a manner similar to a recumbent bicycle. The gears on the rear wheel, the shifter, and the derailleur are all standard bicycle equipment. Feet are on fixed foot rests, as opposed to moving pedals. The seat, which is specific to the RowBike, slides back and forth on rollers. Unlike a boat the rider faces forward. If the rider's stroke favors the left or right side, the rowbike will turn in that direction, similar to how a row boat is turned. Balancing on a two-wheeled rowbike while rowing requires some practice, even for a skilled bicyclist. Drive train Rowbikes transmit power from the rider to the wheels using a standard bicycle chain, rear gears, and derailleur. Both wheels are standard bicycle wheels, the rear wheel is fitted out with a standard freewheel. The chain on a Rowbike does not travel in a loop, as is the case with a standard bicycle. It moves back and forth over the rear cog in a sawing motion. The chain is connected at one end to the frame of the rowbike and to the shock cord (bungee cord) on the other. As the rower pulls back the chain engages the rear cog and the bungee cord, which is concealed in the power lever, is extended, and when the rower returns forward the bungee cord contracts, pulling the chain back and ensuring there is no slack in the chain. Rowbikes have a rear derailleur if they have a multiple chain ring rear hub. The latest design has a NuVinci infinite ratio internally geared hub in the rear wheel, and has a single chain ring and no derailleur, similar to the original single speed models first produced. If the gears on the rear wheel are not optimal an ordinary bicycle has the possibility of changing the size of the gear on the crankset(the chainring). Unlike a bicycle a Rowbike does not have a crank set. To optimize the gearing a pulley called the \\"Dave Cam\\" was introduced in 2006. The Dave Cam doubles the amount of chain pulled with each stroke, as a larger chainring increases the amount of chain pulled with each revolution of the pedals. History The idea of a rowed cycle dates back to at least the 1870s, and several variants have been developed commercially and sold, but there does not seem to be any evidence of a successful mass market design. As of 2018 Rowbikes and other rowed bicycles have not found broad appeal, possibly due to their having a relatively high asking price when compared to indoor rowers. Scott Olsen is quoted as saying \\"the jury is still out on rowbike\\".Excerpt from: 100 Great Businesses and the Minds Behind Them By Emily Ross, Angus Holland A newsreel from 1937 shows a rowed bicycle that is similar to the Rowbike. Instead of a bungee cord, it uses a circular chain case mounted to the rear wheel with a spring to maintain chain tension. Like the first version of the Rowbike,A Rowbike appears at the 5:00 mark in this 1937 newsreel, Video title: lehokola a ≈°lapohyby-historie there is no \\"Dave cam\\" pulley between the lever and the chain.

He has created music under the name of Nature And Organisation since the early 1980s and more recently (2006) under his own name. Michael Cashmore in 2017 Cashmore has also been a member of the group Current 93 since the late 1980s and composed the majority of the music for the group since joining. He has collaborated with many artists including David Tibet, Antony and the Johnsons, Bill Fay, Marc Almond, Nick Cave, Rose McDowall, and Steven Stapleton. After moving to Berlin in 2004 Cashmore broke several years of silence by releasing his first solo CD Sleep England in May 2006. Early 2007 saw the release of The Snow Abides, a mini album containing a collection of songs that feature vocals by Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. In April 2008 Cashmore released a two-track EP with Marc Almond titled Gabriel and the Lunatic Lover which sets two poems \\"Gabriel\\" and \\"The Lunatic Lover\\" by Count Stenbock to music. Marc Almond appeared as a guest of Current 93 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on 21 June 2008 and performed these songs with Cashmore on guitar. These two songs later appeared on a collaborative album by Marc Almond and Michael Cashmore in 2011 called Feasting With Panthers. In 2017 Cashmore reissued published and unpublished works by the group Nature And Organisation on a double CD and a series of four vinyl records with the German label Trisol Music Group GmbH. In the same year Cashmore released an electronic / experimental white vinyl EP under his own name with artist Shaltmira to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the label. Cashmore has publicly stated via social media that he is Transforming himself and his music is a reflection of this Transformation. He released 2 albums on the Austrian label Klanggalerie entitled \\"The Doctrine Of Transformation Through Love\\" parts I and II in 2019/20 which are heavily electronic and experimental but also feature two songs recorded with Bill Fay and Little Annie. Cashmore has also now formed a movement connected to his music called The Hidden Throne which he uses to share and promote his ideas of personal Transformation.

Personal life Juhan Viiding was born on 1 June 1948 in Tallinn to Linda and Paul Viiding. His father Paul was also a well-known poet in Estonia who had belonged to the influential Arbujad (Soothsayers) - a collective group of eight young influential poets who rose to prominence before the outbreak of World War II. Juhan was the youngest of four children and the only boy‚Äîhis older sisters were Reet, Anni and Mari. He was an intellectually precocious and restless youngster. Between the years 1968 and 1972, Viiding studied theatre and stagecraft at the Tallinn Conservatory (now the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre), under instruction of actor and theatre pedagogue Voldemar Panso, graduating in 1972. Among his graduating classmates were Kersti Kreismann, Ivo Eensalu, Vello Janson, Rein Kotkas, Helle Meri (n√©e Pihlak), Katrin Kumpan, Martin Veinmann, and T√µnis R√§tsep. Juhan Viiding was married to Riina Kiisk, the daughter of actor, film director and politician Kaljo Kiisk. Their daughter Elo is also a poet. On 21 February 1995 Juhan Viiding committed suicide in Rapla by cutting his wrists. Dramatic career Upon his graduation in 1972, Viiding worked in Tallinn's National Drama Theatre (now the Estonian Drama Theatre). During the last ten years of his life Viiding staged many plays. His favourite playwrights were Samuel Beckett, Eug√®ne Ionesco, and Minoru Betsuyaku. Viiding worked at the Estonian Drama Theatre until his death on 21 February 1995. Literary career Juhan Viiding who until 1975 published his poetry under the pseudonym J√ºri √údi was the brightest talent to appear in Estonian poetry in the 1970s. Unlike the major poets of the immediately preceding generation (Rummo, Kaplinski, Runnel), he never wrote essays or criticism. The heteronymic poetics of the modern Portuguese classic Fernando Pessoa (whose selected poetry was translated into Estonian in 1973), may have served as an impulse for Juhan Viiding to create the poet J√ºri √údi. However, the difference between the works published under the author's name and his pseudonym is that the \\"marrow\\" of Juhan Viiding's poetry remained in his George Marrow pseudonym; what followed, under his authentic name, lacked the former brilliance. J√ºri √údi's playfulness and rich undertones gave way to a more direct and pathetic expression. It is not known whether Viiding intended to develop a second poetic voice in addition to that of J√ºri √údi, or that he simply realized that the Soviet era of ideological symbols‚Äîas described in his \\"J√ºri‚Äôs Yarn\\"‚Äîwas coming to an end and the actor J√ºri √údi could drop the mask to reveal Juhan Viiding's true literary face. In October 1980, Viiding was a signatory of the Letter of 40 Intellectuals, a public letter in which forty prominent Estonian intellectuals defended the Estonian language and protested the Russification policies of the Kremlin in Estonia. The signatories also expressed their unease against Republic-level government in harshly dealing with youth protests in Tallinn that were sparked a week earlier due to the banning of a public performance of the punk rock band Propeller.

He played as a right-back or centre-back. Career Born in Bromsgrove, Whitehead began his career at his hometown club Bromsgrove Rovers. After a season with the club, he joined then-Premiership Bolton Wanderers in 1995 on a free transfer. Bolton were relegated in his first season with them, but won promotion back to the Premier League in the following season. After another top-flight season, Bolton and Whitehead parted company, with Whitehead never appearing for the club. A regular starting role at Carlisle United followed, with Carlisle spending the whole period near the bottom of the Football League. He appeared in the famous Jimmy Glass game against Plymouth Argyle, in which the goalkeeper scored in the 94th minute to keep Carlisle United in the Football League. A ten-month spell at Darlington followed before Whitehead dropped down to the Football Conference in August 2003 for a season with Telford United. Telford, and their chairman, were to go bankrupt at the end of the season, so Whitehead made the short move to newly promoted (to League Two) Shrewsbury Town. In his two seasons with the club, Whitehead became Shrewsbury's first-choice right-back, making 70 appearances for the Shropshire club. However, on 14 April 2006 he was released by Shrewsbury to allow the emergence of Gavin Cadwallader. Whitehead agreed to join Conference club Kidderminster Harriers on a two-year contract in the summer of 2006. In his first season Whitehead played well and was a vital part of the FA Trophy run to the finals. He led the team out on 12 May hoping to lift the trophy but, unfortunately he will go down in history as the first captain to lose a competitive match at Wembley. Whitehead left Kidderminster by mutual consent on 31 January 2008 and subsequently made his return to the New Bucks Head, signing an 18-month deal with Conference North side AFC Telford United. At the start of the 2008/2009 season, Whitehead was named as the new AFC Telford United captain. At the end of the 2009/2010 season, following the dismissal of Rob Smith, Whitehead was named caretaker manager for Telford's final game of the season, a 3‚Äì1 defeat away to Vauxhall Motors. He left Telford in January 2012, joining Worcester City the next day.

He was twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, making him one of the only two partisan leaders to receive the title twice (the other being fellow Ukrainian Sydir Kovpak).  Biography  Oleksiy Fedorov was born near Dnipropetrovsk in a Ukrainian—Ñ.–ü-470, –æ–±–ª—ñ–∫–æ–≤–∞ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∫–∞ peasant family. In 1920 he joined the Red Army and fought in the Russian Civil War. In 1927 he joined Communist Party of the Soviet Union and by 1938 became a first secretary of the regional party committee in Chernihiv Oblast. After the Nazi Germany invasion of the Soviet Union, Fedorov became a prominent organizer of the underground resistance in occupied Ukraine. During the winter of 1941-1942 he commanded Chernigov partisan unit which by March 1942 had sixteen engagements with the enemy and killed over a thousand German troops. In May 1942 Oleksiy Fedorov was awarded a title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin with a golden star. During the spring and summer of 1943 Fedorov's partisan units expanded guerrilla activities into other occupied regions of USSR outside north-east Ukraine including the Volyn, Belarus, Bryansk and Oryol regions. During the legendary Kovel railway hub operation in the autumn of 1943 and the following winter, the partisans of Fedorov liquidated over 500 German supply trains full of ammunition, fuel, military equipment and army personnel. Oleksiy Fedorov was promoted to the rank of major general and in January 1944 awarded a second Gold Star medal.  Civilian life  After the liberation of Ukraine, Oleksiy Fedorov headed Communist party committees in several Ukrainian regions including Kherson (1944‚Äì1949) Izmail (1950‚Äì1952) and Zhytomyr (1952‚Äì1957) oblasts.

They performed at rallies for Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League, and at Right to Work marches. British music magazine Sounds used the phrase \\"Music to March To\\" to describe their controversial and radical left- wing form of punk rock. History =Formation and career= Crisis formed in 1977 with the lineup of Phrazer (vocals), Lester Jones (lead guitar), Douglas Pearce (guitar), Tony Wakeford (bass) and Insect Robin the Cleaner (drums). Their debut single, \\"No Town Hall\\", was released in 1978 on Action Group Records. On 11 January 1978, Crisis recorded four tracks at a Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, with two of the tracks released as the \\"UK 79\\" 7\\" single in 1979 on the Ardkor label. The remaining two Peel Session songs were posthumously issued by Ardkor in 1981 as \\"Alienation\\". In early 1979, the band underwent a major change in personnel when Phrazer and Insect Robin the Cleaner were replaced by Dexter (a longtime fan and roadie) and Luke Rendle. After performing their last show, supporting Magazine and Bauhaus in their hometown of Guildford on 10 May 1980, the band broke up. A recording of the final show was released in 2008 as the Ends! CD. =Later projects= Pearce and Wakeford went on to form Death in June in 1981. Wakeford later joined The Runners from 84, Above the Ruins and Sol Invictus. Rendle joined the Straps, then The Pack/Theatre of Hate. Jones formed Carcrash International. In 1985, Jones also performed as a touring member of Andi Sex Gang & the Quick Gas Gang. =Legacy= The Crisis discography has been compiled on CD twice (as We Are All Jews and Germans double CD in 1997 by World Serpent, and as Holocaust Hymns single CD in 2005 by Apop Records), as well as once on vinyl LP Kollectiv in 2014 by La Vida Es un Mus). =Reformation= In 2015, Wakeford formed the ensemble 1.9.8.4., to perform the songs he had written for both Crisis and Death in June. In 2017, 1.9.8.4., was renamed Crisis, announcing concerts in the UK and Europe in 2017 and 2018. The new Crisis line-up consists of original member Wakeford on bass, Lloyd James (of Naevus) on vocals, Clive Giblin (of Alternative TV) on guitar and Igor Olejar (of Autorotation) on drums. In a November 2017 interview with Louder Than War, Wakeford said, \\"It became increasingly obvious that there was major interest in Crisis and that the band and songs held a special place in people hearts...There is obviously a growing interest in that period, with a lot of bands reforming. Crisis were an important part of that history, and I think the band sound fresh and the songs are still valid, perhaps even more so today\\". In mid-2018, Aurora Lee replaced Olejar on drums.

He was also a member of the Nigerian national team from 2002 until October 2015, serving as its captain from 2013 until his retirement from international football. With 101 caps, he is Nigeria's most capped player of all time. Club career =Enyimba International= During his spell with Enyimba International F.C., he won the CAF Champions League twice, with one noteworthy distinction: He was always substituted before penalty shootouts. \\"I don't know why I was substituted before penalties, but it worked,\\" he said in an interview in 2006. \\"In Israel I stopped many penalties and now everyone knows that I can handle penalties.\\" =Bnei Yehuda= After three seasons with Enyimba International F.C. and one with Iwuanyanwu Nationale (now known as Heartland F.C.), Enyeama moved to small Israeli club Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv. In his first season, the team qualified for the final of the Israel State Cup and, having finished fourth in the Israeli Premier League, for the 2006 UEFA Cup competition as well. =Hapoel Tel Aviv= Enyeama signed for Hapoel Tel Aviv in 2007. Hapoel endured a poor season in 2007/2008, but Enyeama helped the team avoid relegation and reach the state cup final. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, Enyeama became Hapoel's penalty kicker, won the \\"Player of The Year\\" award, and just missed leading Hapoel to the league title. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Hapoel won the league and cup double, with Enyeama featuring prominently. He scored a goal in the Cup Final, but missed a penalty in the last fixture of the year, which Hapoel eventually won by scoring in the 92nd minute, thereby capturing the league title. On 18 August 2010, he scored his first goal of the 2010‚Äì11 season with a penalty against Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League qualifiers. Enyeama played well on the Champions League Group Stage, especially against Lyon and Schalke 04. Hapoel also won the Israeli cup again. =Lille= In June 2011 Enyeama moved to French side Lille for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract. He made his debut on 18 October 2011 against Inter Milan in the 2012 UEFA Champions League group stage, where Inter managed a 1‚Äì0 victory. In August 2012 Enyeama agreed a one-year loan deal with Maccabi Tel Aviv and was presented to the media by Maccabi's Sports Director Jordi Cruyff at 8 August 2012. He appeared in 27 Israeli Premier League fixtures and Maccabi went on to win the championship title. During the 2013‚Äì14 Ligue 1 season, club manager Ren√© Girard picked Enyeama as his first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Steeve Elana, who had previously been the first-choice goalkeeper under Rudi Garcia. With the help of his two centre-backs, Marko Ba≈°a and Simon Kj√¶r, Enyeama kept 11 consecutive clean sheets in Ligue 1 matches during the first half of the season. On 8 December 2013, Enyeama finally conceded a goal after playing 1,062 minutes of Ligue 1 football in an away match against Bordeaux, during which he was beaten by Landry N'Gu√©mo's deflected strike in the 27th minute. He thus came within 114 minutes of equalling Ga√´tan Huard's Ligue 1 goalkeeping record, set in 1993, of playing 1,176 minutes without conceding a goal. In the 2017‚Äì18 season Enyeama did not make a league appearance having been left out of the first team due to \\"a disagreement between the player and the club's management\\". He joined the first team's pre- season training in July 2018. He was released by mutual consent on 31 August 2018. In January 2019 he said he was keen to play again, and in July 2019 he went on trial with French club Dijon. Despite not being offered a contract by Dijon he expressed gratitude to the club. International career After making his debut for the Nigeria national football team against Kenya in May 2002, Enyeama was selected for the 2002 FIFA World Cup as a cover for Ike Shorunmu. He made his competitive debut in that tournament, keeping a clean sheet against England in the third group match. Since the retirement of Shorunmu, he has been the first-choice goalkeeper for the national team, helping the Super Eagles to third-place finishes in the 2004, 2006, 2010 Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, and captaining the team to victory of in the 2013 edition. He has also participated in the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. In the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, Enyeama stopped three kicks in the quarter-final penalty shootout against Tunisia, but could not prevent a loss to Ivory Coast in the semi-final. In the 2010 tournament, he was again Nigeria's shootout hero at the quarter-final stage, saving from Zambia's Thomas Nyrienda and scoring the winning kick himself. Enyeama made his second FIFA World Cup appearance in the 2010 tournament in South Africa. He was named man of the match in Nigeria's first game of the tournament, a defiant display that restricted Argentina to a 1‚Äì0 win. Enyeama, who was playing his 56th international for the Super Eagles, made six fine saves against the two-time world champions, four of them from Lionel Messi. Argentine coach Diego Maradona praised him as the reason Messi was not able to score a goal. Enyeama was also awarded man of the match in the team's next fixture, a 2‚Äì1 loss to Greece, but was at fault for Vasilis Torosidis' winning goal.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_19/default.stm At the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, Enyeama deputised for regular captain Joseph Yobo, who stayed on the bench for most of the competition. On 10 February, Enyeama led Nigeria to its third continental victory, keeping a clean sheet in a 1‚Äì0 defeat of Burkina Faso in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations Final. He was named to the team of the tournament as first choice goalkeeper, conceding only four goals in six matches. In June 2014, Enyeama was named in Nigeria's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the Super Eagles' first fixture, he kept the second FIFA World Cup clean sheet of his career as Nigeria drew 0‚Äì0 with Iran. He subsequently recorded a second consecutive shutout in the fixture against Bosnia and Herzegovina, a 1‚Äì0 win which gave Nigeria its first win at the tournament since the 1998 edition. He conceded three goals in the last match of the first round against Argentina, a game which ended in a 3‚Äì2 defeat for Nigeria, placing them second in the group and thus qualifying them for the second round for the first time in 16 years. On 26 March 2015, Enyeama won his 100th cap for Nigeria in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Uganda. He retired from international football on 8 October 2015 but later reinstated himself in October 2017. Personal life A Christian from Ika Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, Enyeama is married and a father of three. In 2004, he was involved in a car accident in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State southern Nigeria, in which two motorcycle passengers were killed. The driver of the car in which Enyeama was travelling was left in critical condition. Despite the severity of the accident, Enyeama suffered only bruises after the car somersaulted twice as it swerved to avoid the motorbike.

Union columns converged on Petersburg on April 2, pushing through a large section of the Confederate defensive entrenchments. As Robert E. Lee desperately sought to buy time to allow his army to withdraw, Ulysses S. Grant launched several other attacks. Stubborn Confederate resistance at Fort Gregg delayed Grant's progress. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Nelson A. Miles's Union division battered Henry Heth's Confederates near Sutherland's Station and drove them off the field. The Confederate defenders were scattered and driven northwestward. With this victory, the Federals possessed the South Side Railroad, Gen. Robert E. Lee's last supply line into Petersburg. However, the lengthy defense of Fort Gregg and Grant's hesitation in aggressively following up on his success at Sutherland's Station permitted Lee to evacuate his army that night. Battle Map of Sutherland's Station Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant had besieged Petersburg for ten long months, but as April 1865 opened, the Army of the Potomac under its commander, George G. Meade, was finally in a position to break through the entrenchments of the Army of Northern Virginia. At 4:30 on the morning of April 2 on the Confederate earthworks west of Petersburg. Meade sent forward four Union corps, with the VI Corps succeeding in breaking through the thinly manned Confederate lines. Flushed with success, the Union troops poured through the breach and turned the Southern flanks, eventually gaining control of the entrenchments from Hatcher's Run to Boydton Plank Road. Robert E. Lee, realizing that the loss of so much of his defensive perimeter had now doomed the city, issued orders to evacuate Petersburg. He sent word to his remaining commanders to hold as long as they could to allow an orderly retreat. Federal troops repeatedly attacked Fort Gregg (held by only 500 Confederate defenders), but failed to quickly seize the vital fort, allowing Lee time to establish an inner defensive line to protect his army's rear as it retired. Grant turned his attention to the west, where the South Side Railroad had provided a vital last supply line for Lee's beleaguered troops. Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's II Corps faced the forces of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth running from Hatcher's Run to White Oak Road. Heth's men constituted the extreme right flank of Lee's army. Nelson Miles's division had been sent to reinforce Philip Sheridan on the Union flank. Not needing the infantry support, Sheridan sent Miles back. Once the VI Corps had broken through, Humphreys was ordered to attack along his front. When the order came for Humphreys to attack, Heth had already begun to fall back to a secondary line. Humphreys only had one division available to attack. Not far from the battlefield of Battle of Five Forks, his only available division easily pushed forward through light resistance and seized a salient in the Confederate line. When Miles' division of three brigades returned, it faced abandoned trenches. Humphreys wanted to immediately move against Heth, but Meade had ordered all the Union infantry to turn and face Petersburg. Humphreys responded by turning to the north, but left Miles behind to deal with Heth. Miles pursued the retiring Confederates up the Claiborne Road as far as Sutherland's Station (nineteen miles from Petersburg). There, Heth had regrouped four Confederate brigades in an attempt to defend the South Side Railroad, their left flank anchored at Ocran Methodist Church. By now, Heth had learned that Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill had been killed earlier in the day, and now he was in command of the Third Army Corps as its senior division commander. Dodging Federal patrols, he hastened to Petersburg, where he found that Lee had instead decided to disband the corps and give its units to James Longstreet. At 3:00 p.m., Miles struck north from White Oak Road and launched his initial attack under orders from Grant to follow up on Humphreys's initial breakthrough. Heth's division repulsed two Federal attacks before Miles sent for reinforcements. As had been the case for the II Corps all morning, Humphreys backtracked to Sutherland Station to reinforce Miles. However, Miles launched a third assault and Heth's weary Confederates finally buckled, then broke. John R. Cooke's brigade stubbornly held up the Federals as the remainder of Heth's troops headed west. Miles's victorious men pushed ahead and captured nearly 1,000 prisoners and 2 artillery pieces. In the meantime, Grant had delayed the final attack on Fort Gregg while he awaited news regarding Miles' outcome, another delay that helped Lee evacuate more troops from Petersburg. By the time that the fort finally fell, Lee had bought enough time to successfully extricate the vast majority of his army. In the savage fighting around Sutherland's Station, Miles reported 370 casualties, while the Confederates lost approximately 600 men killed or wounded, plus 1,000 taken as prisoners of war. Humphreys's II Corps had been made to wander back and forth all morning and the general later contended that, had his whole corps been allowed to move against the Confederates, Heth's whole command would have been destroyed.

It was founded in India in 1879 by Helena Blavatsky, who was also its editor. The journal is still being published till date. For the year 1930, the journal was published in Hollywood, California by Annie Besant and Marie Russak Hotchener, but it returned to Adyar in 1931. The journal features articles about philosophy, art, literature and occultism.  The Theosophical Society  The Theosophical Society was officially formed in New York City, United States, on 17 November 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge, and others. The society's initial objective was the \\"study and elucidation of Occultism, the Cabala etc.\\"See photographic reproduction of the \\"Notes of meeting proposing the formation of the Theosophical Society, New York City, 8 September 1875\\" on this page. File:St-1ata.jpg. Wikimedia Commons. It established its roots in India in 1879, winning its supporters by its portrayal of sympathy for the native population, by its enthusiasm for the Aryan philosophy, and by its strange dogmas and obscure beliefs. The main objectives of the society were to establish British India as a center of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, to study the Aryan culture and to explore the hidden mysteries and inherent powers in men. The widespread influence of The Theosophist extended to many parts of the world. The first centre was established in Bombay, but the society soon installed a network of branches throughout India, and its journal, The Theosophist, was circulated extensively throughout the three Presidencies.  History  Due to its widespread circulation, The Theosophist has been heavily linked with the politics of British India. Despite not explicitly stating any political agendas as of yet, it has been associated with the formation of Congress.Theosophist, IV, no.8 (44) (May 1883), 2-6 According to the later account of Annie Besant, it was discovered that the decision to convene the first Congress in Madras was taken on the recommendation of the Theosophical Society after its convention of December 1884.A. Besant, How India Wrought for Freedom (Adyar, 1915), pp. 1-2. The success of the periodical publications of the journal has been identified as an encouragement for many of the Indian leaders to experiment by forming an Indian political congress. Until 1909, The Theosophist was printed by Messrs. Thompson & Co., Printers, in Madras (now Chennai). The journey between headquarters in Adyar and the printer in Madras was troublesome as it involved a jolting carriage ride that could take an hour each way. Colonel Olcott wished to have a printing company at Adyar for the journal and other publications, but that did not occur until 1909, when the Vasan·π≠ƒÅ Press was established under the presidency of Annie Besant. Hand-powered equipment was used for printing initially. In October 1911, a larger type was introduced for improved legibility. The number of copies printed grew from 400Mary K. Neff, \\"The Hidden Side of The Theosophist,\\" The Theosophist 51:1 (October, 1929), 66. in the first issue to 800 in 1909 and 4000 two years later.A. K. Sitarama Shastri, \\"'The Theosophist' in the Vasan·π≠ƒÅ Press,\\" The Theosophist 51:1 (October, 1929), 40. In 1936, President George S. Arundale reshaped the journal into being more of a magazine for a general readership. He appointed an American Editorial Committee that was associated with the Editorial Board at Adyar. The three members were Fritz Kunz, Professor H. Douglas Wild, and Claude Bragdon. The announcement stated: \\"Beginning with January, 1936, The Theosophist will be edited as far as possible in the interest of the general public, publishing articles which will relate religion, science, philosophy, psychology, politics, industry, etc., to the science of Theosophy in a manner calculated to arouse the interest of the public. The Theosophical World, an enlargement of Adyar News, will keep members in touch with the Society's special affairs and growth. The American Editorial Committee has been requested to cooperate in the publication of The Theosophist through personal contributions, through gathering contributions from other qualified writers, and also, if possible, by making arrangements for advertisements.\\"\\"American Editorial Committee,\\" The American Theosophist 24.3 (March, 1936), 70.

The house, now Grade II* listed, is currently open to the public as a museum. 18 Stafford Terrace was an almost new townhouse when the Sambournes moved in, in 1875. It was Linley Sambourne who set about re-decorating the house in the Aesthetic style. Today the house is a fine example of middle-class Aestheticism; its influences can still be seen permeating throughout the house, from decorative Sunflower motifs in the stained glass windows to the fine selection of William Morris wallpapers that hang within the rooms through to the displayed collection of blue-and-white Chinese import porcelain. Legacy Linley Sambourne died in 1910 but it wasn't until his wife Marion's death four years later that the house passed to their bachelor son Roy. Roy kept the house's interior largely unchanged until his own death in 1946. The house then passed to Roy's sister Maud Messel. Maud already had a large London residence therefore 18 Stafford remained mostly unoccupied and unchanged. In the years leading up to Maud's death in 1960, the house had become increasingly fascinating to her daughter Anne, Countess of Rosse. This fascination led to Anne proposing the foundation of the Victorian Society in 1957, and in turn the continued preservation of the house largely as it had been lived in by Linley. Lady Rosse negotiated the sale of the house to the Greater London Council and the lease to the Victorian Society in 1980; the house was then opened to the public as a museum which included the furniture, art, and decorative schemes retained from its original inhabitants, Linley Sambourne and his household. Following the demise of the Greater London Council the ownership of the house transferred to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in 1989. The Royal Borough continued to work with the Victorian Society until 2000, when the lease to the Victorian Society wasn't renewed. The Sambourne Family Archive The archive is made up of personal papers relating to Edward Linley Sambourne, members of his family and their home at 18 Stafford Terrace. Dating from 1815 to the present day it includes diaries, letters, legal and financial papers, photographs and ephemera which give insights into both Sambourne's professional and middle-class family life in the later Victorian/Edwardian period.

Name The name Creil comes from the name of a former village that was once on the coast of the Zuiderzee, which was in turn named after the Creil Woods that was once located northeast of North-Holland, in what is now the IJsselmeer, roughly between Texel and Enkhuizen. History Modern Creil was designed by the Board of the Wieringermeer, one of whom's jobs was to design and oversee the construction of the settlements in the newly created polders, construction of the town started in 1953. Facilities In 2004, a building formerly belonging to the Catholic church in the centre of Creil was restructured into a service centre called The Saalicon. It houses a pharmacy, clinic, hair salon, centre for the elderly and several art exhibitions of local artists. Creil is home to three elementary schools, the Catholic Jan Roothaan-school, the public elementary school De Springplank and the Christian elementary school De Regenboog. These schools share the same building and share many public facilities such as the schoolyard and the gymnastics hall.

Ellington and Billy Strayhorn wrote the compositions. The album was reissued in 1995 with four previously unreleased alternate takes. In 2003, Bluebird Records issued the album on CD with additional bonus takes. Strayhorn died in May 1967, making Far East Suite one of the last albums recorded during his life to feature his compositions.  Background  The album's title is something of a misnomer. As critics Richard Cook and Brian Morton wrote \\"it really should have been The Near East Suite.\\" Strictly speaking, only one track - \\"Ad Lib on Nippon\\", inspired by a 1964 tour of Japan - is concerned with a country in the \\"Far East\\". The rest of the music on the album was inspired by a world tour undertaken by Ellington and his orchestra in 1963, which included performances in Damascus, Amman, Ramall'ah, Kabul, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore (now Bengaluru), Madras (now Chennai), Bombay (now Mumbai), Calcutta (now Kolkata), Columbo, Kandy, Dacca (now Dhaka), Lahore, Karachi, Tehran, Isfahan, Abadan, Baghdad, and Beirut. The band arrived in Ankara but U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated the day before its concert, and the State Department cancelled the tour. Scheduled performances in Istanbul, Nicosia, Cairo, Alexandria, Athens, Thessaloniki, and a week added to the tour for Yugoslavia were cancelled. In early 1964, while on tour in England, Ellington and Strayhorn performed four pieces of music for the first time (\\"Mynah\\", \\"Depk\\", \\"Agra\\", and \\"Amad\\"), which they called \\"Expressions of the Far East\\". By the time of the recording sessions in December 1966 Ellington and Strayhorn had added four more pieces. One, the latter's \\"Isfahan\\" was formerly known as \\"Elf\\", and had in fact been written months prior to the 1963 tour.  Legacy  Ellington very rarely performed the pieces that made up The Far East Suite. Cook and Morton have suggested that \\"Isfahan\\", which later became a jazz standard, \\"is arguably the most beautiful item in Ellington's and Strayhorn's entire output.\\" The album had a big impact on the Asian American jazz movement. In 1999, Anthony Brown recorded the entire suite with his Asian-American Orchestra. Unlike the 1967 album, Brown's version used Eastern instruments along with standard jazz instruments.  Reception  Cook and Morton, writing for The Penguin Guide to Jazz, give the album a four-star rating (of a possible four), noting that \\"Ellington's ability to communicate points of contact and conflict between cultures, assimilating the blues to Eastern modes in tracks like 'Blue Pepper (Far East of the Blues),' never sounds unduly self-conscious. This remains a postwar peak.\\" Scott Yanow, writing for Allmusic, calls this one of Ellington's \\"more memorable recordings,\\" describing it as an example of \\"Ellington and Strayhorn in their late prime,\\" and as such, \\"quite essential.\\" Participating in Down Beat' s Blindfold Test shortly after the album's release, composer-arranger Clare Fischer was played track #7, \\"Agra.\\" A longtime admirer and student of Ellington's work, Fischer had no trouble identifying the artist, awarding the track five stars, citing both \\"Duke's immensely creative writing\\" and his inexplicable ability to transcend \\"this same old tired instrumentation of trumpets, trombones and saxophones,\\" while \\"perfect[ly] utilizing the men's specific sounds.\\" In addition, Fischer praised Ellington's ability to \\"take an exotic-sounding idea and create something ‚Äì you might call it sophisticated crudity. It gives both qualities that I look for ‚Äì an earthy quality and the sophisticated quality.\\"Feather, Leonard. \\"Clare Fischer ‚Äì Blindfold Test\\". Down Beat. October 18, 1967.

First Roberts Commission The first Roberts Commission was a presidentially-appointed commission formed in December 1941, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, to investigate and report the facts relating to the attack. The commission was headed by US Supreme Court Associate Justice Owen Roberts and so it was known as the Roberts Commission. The commission found the commanders of Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short, guilty of \\"dereliction of duty.\\" It exonerated Hawaiian Air Force commander, Major General Frederick L. Martin who had also been relieved of command immediately following the attack and his Navy counterpart Patrick N. L. Bellinger (who had not been relieved) with the simple statement ‚Äúsubordinate commanders executed their superiors‚Äô orders without question. They were not responsible for the state of readiness prescribed.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdmiral Kimmel, General Short Held Derelict in Duties,‚Äù The Miami Daily News, 25 January, 1942. The Commission presented its findings to Congress January 28, 1942. Members of the commission besides Justice Roberts were Adm. William H. Standley, Adm. Joseph M. Reeves, Gen. Frank R. McCoy, and Gen. Joseph T. McNarney. The commission was a fact-finding commission, not a court-martial for either Short or Kimmel. Some claimed that the report also concluded that both Japanese diplomats and persons of Japanese ancestry had engaged in widespread espionage leading up to the attack, and used this to justify Japanese American incarceration. One passage made vague reference to \\"Japanese consular agents and other... persons having no open relations with the Japanese foreign service\\" transmitting information to Japan. However, it was unlikely that these \\"spies\\" were Japanese American, as Japanese intelligence agents were distrustful of their American counterparts and preferred to recruit \\"white persons and Negroes\\"Niiya, Brian. \\",\\" Densho Encyclopedia.

Second Roberts Commission The second Roberts Commission, also presidential-appointed is also known after its chairman, again Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts. It was created to help the US Army protect works of cultural value in Allied- occupied areas of Europe. Its formal name was the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas. The commission also developed inventories of Nazi-appropriated property. Along with the US Military program known as Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA), the commission worked to rescue and preserve items of cultural significance. The commission took place from 1943 to 1946.

It lies in the municipality of Noordoostpolder next to a crossroads where provincial road N712 from Urk to Lemmer intersects with road N714 to Emmeloord, roughly 6 km to the east. Name Espel is named after the former village of Espelbergh, also known as Espelo, which was situated north of Urk until it and a large amount of nearby land were washed away in the All Saints' Flood of 1570. History Espel was founded in 1956 as an agricultural settlement and one of the green villages spread around the Noordoostpolder. Shortly after being founded Espel was granted several facilities, namely shops, three schools, two churches and two cafetaria. Facilities =General facilities= Today Espel features its own church, a school, a cafeteria with restaurant and bowling centre, and athletic fields for the local football club, FC Espel. In 2002 the last supermarket in the village shut down, and in 2009 the last shop closed its doors as well. In 2011, by public initiative, a new supermarket called the Troefmarkt was opened by an entrepreneur from Lelystad. In 2014 the store was bought by a different entrepreneur from the nearby Tollebeek, and was added to his chain of Attent supermarkets. =Church= Tower of the Una Sancta The local church, the Una Sancta, was built from 1959 to 1962, relatively shortly after the founding of Espel and is operated by the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, abbreviated as PKN, a 2004 merger of many former Protestant churches. The modern white cylindrical church tower especially stands out in its unique style. From 1960 to 1961 a second, Catholic church was built in the village. It was named Kerk van de Verrijzenis des Heren, which translates to Church of the Rising of the Lord. It is no longer in use. =Surrounding countryside= The area around Espel is an important area in the cultivation of bulbous flowers, mainly but not exclusively tulips. Each spring a walking and cycling route is laid out along the blooming fields. To the west of Espel, along the dyke that forms the coast with the IJsselmeer, is Windpark Noordoostpolder, a partially on-shore, partially off-shore wind farm. It opened in June 2016 and is the largest wind farm of its kind in the Netherlands. The windpark will feature a total of 86 wind turbines upon completion in 2017. Public transportation Espel has a bus connection operated by Connexxion, Line 77, which connects Espel with other villages in the Noordoostpolder. * Line 77: Lemmer - Rutten - Creil - Espel - Emmeloord vv. Espel is connected by road via provincial road N712 which leads to Tollebeek Urk to the south, and Creil, Rutten and Lemmer to the North. Provincial road N714 starts in Espel and heads east to Emmeloord. There is no railway station in Espel, but the nearest stations are in Kampen, Dronten and Lelystad.

The basic ultralight category was established as a new category in 1982 to fill this gap. Regulation of ultralight aircraft in Canada is covered by the Canadian Aviation Regulations, which defines a \\"basic ultra- light aeroplane\\" as: an aeroplane having no more than two seats, designed and manufactured to have: * a maximum take-off weight not exceeding 544 kg (1,200 pounds), and * a stall speed in the landing configuration (VS0) of 39 knots (45 mph) indicated airspeed, or less, at the maximum take-off weight; = Advanced ultra-light aeroplane = According to Canadian Aviation Regulations, Part I, Subpart 1, an \\"advanced ultra-light aeroplane\\" means an aeroplane that has a type design that is in compliance with the standards specified in the manual entitled Design Standards for Advanced Ultra-light Aeroplanes (DS10141).DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ADVANCED ULTRA-LIGHT AEROPLANES DS 10141E An advanced ultra-light aeroplane is an aeroplane which: * Is propeller driven; * Is designed to carry a maximum of two persons, including the pilot; * Has a maximum take-off mass, MTOmax or WTOmax, of: *# 350 kg (770 lb) for a single place aeroplane, or *# 560.0 kg (1232 lb) for a two place aeroplane; * A maximum stalling speed in the landing configuration, VS0, at manufacturer's recommended maximum take-off mass (weight) not exceeding 72 km/h (20 m/s, 45 mph) (IAS); and * Is limited to non-aerobatic operations. Non-aerobatic operations include: *# manoeuvres incident to normal flying *# stalls and spins (if approved for type); *# lazy eights, chandelles; and *# steep turns, in which the angle of bank is not more than 60¬∞ The advanced ultra-light aeroplane (AULA) category is similar, but not identical, to the American light sport aircraft (LSA) category. Many aircraft are available as AULAs in Canada and LSAs in the United States.  Minimum useful load  Advanced ultra- light aeroplanes shall have a minimum useful load, MU or WU computed as follows: * For a single place aeroplane: ::MU = 80 + 0.3P, in kg; where P is the rated engine(s) power in kilowatts; ::MU = 175 + 0.5P, in lb; where P is the rated engine(s) power in brake horsepower (bhp). * For a two place aeroplane: ::MU = 160 + 0.3P, in kg; where P is the rated engine(s) power in kW; ::MU = 350 + 0.5P, in lb; where P is the rated engine(s) power in bhp.  Maximum empty mass (weight)  The maximum empty mass, MEmax, (WEmax) includes all operational equipment that is actually installed in the aeroplane. It includes the mass (weight) of the airframe, powerplant, required equipment, optional and specific equipment, fixed ballast, full engine coolant, hydraulic fluid, and the residual fuel and oil. Hence, the maximum empty mass (weight) = maximum take-off mass (weight) - minimum useful load. The registration marks for an advanced ultra-light aeroplane after 1997 begin with \\"C-Ixxx\\". Prior to that date they were C-Fxxx or C-Gxxx.  Operations  An ultra-light pilot permit, recreational pilot permit, private, commercial or airline transport aeroplane licence issued by Transport Canada, is required in order for a person to operate an ultra-light aeroplane in Canada. Pilots holding a Recreational or higher license may carry a passenger in a two-seat advanced ultra-light aeroplane. Pilots with only an ultra-light permit may not carry a passenger in an advanced ultralight unless they have received a passenger carrying endorsement. Basic ultralights cannot carry passengers unless the passenger is another pilot. Student pilots undergoing training may be carried in basic ultralights. Canadian Basic and Advanced Ultralights may be flown in the USA if the pilot holds a Recreational Pilot Permit or higher designation. Pilots holding an Ultralight Pilot Permit with instructor rating and who have at least 2 hours of cross country experience may also fly to the US. Any Canadian Ultralight flying to the US also requires a Special Flight Operations Certificate from the FAA. This is a form the pilot completes which is then valid for 180 days.

History Nagele was designed by the architectural team \\"De 8\\" between 1948 and 1954. The final design by Aldo van Eyck and de 8 was shown at the CIAM 8 meeting in 1956. While the current condition of the town differs from the original design, some of the basic concepts remain. The organization of the Noordoostpolder area was based on a central nucleus with smaller towns circling around connected by roads back to the center. Nagele was proposed to be southwest of the main town, and was originally to be planned to contain 300 dwelling units, 3 churches, 3 primary schools, a post office, fire station, hotel, cafes, a clinic, cemetery, sports field, swimming pool and business zone. Aldo van Eyck proposed that the town be designed around 3 principles: 1. a non-hierarchical organization with mixed social groups, 2. a windbreak of trees to give the village a spatial character and stand out in the polder landscape, and 3. an open green center. The final design accepted by the Wieringermeer board included these ideas, which can still be seen today. The dwelling units form smaller courtyards that are shared around the outside of the main green, these clusters in turn forming the visual boundaries of the center.

It is also known as information radius (IRad) or total divergence to the average. It is based on the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence, with some notable (and useful) differences, including that it is symmetric and it always has a finite value. The square root of the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence is a metric often referred to as Jensen-Shannon distance. Definition Consider the set M_+^1(A) of probability distributions where A is a set provided with some œÉ-algebra of measurable subsets. In particular we can take A to be a finite or countable set with all subsets being measurable. The Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence (JSD) M_+^1(A) \\\\times M_+^1(A) \\\\rightarrow [0,\\\\infty{}) is a symmetrized and smoothed version of the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence D(P \\\\parallel Q). It is defined by :{\\\\rm JSD}(P \\\\parallel Q)= \\\\frac{1}{2}D(P \\\\parallel M)+\\\\frac{1}{2}D(Q \\\\parallel M) where M=\\\\frac{1}{2}(P+Q) A generalization of the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence using abstract means (like the geometric or harmonic means) instead of the arithmetic mean was recently proposed. The geometric Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence (or G-Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence) yields a closed-form formula for divergence between two Gaussian distributions by taking the geometric mean. A more general definition, allowing for the comparison of more than two probability distributions, is: :{\\\\rm JSD}_{\\\\pi_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\pi_n}(P_1, P_2, \\\\ldots, P_n) = H\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\pi_i P_i\\\\right) - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\pi_i H(P_i) where \\\\pi_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\pi_n are weights that are selected for the probability distributions P_1, P_2, \\\\ldots, P_n and H(P) is the Shannon entropy for distribution P. For the two-distribution case described above, :P_1=P, P_2=Q, \\\\pi_1 = \\\\pi_2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}.\\\\ Bounds The Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence is bounded by 1 for two probability distributions, given that one uses the base 2 logarithm. :0 \\\\leq {\\\\rm JSD}( P \\\\parallel Q ) \\\\leq 1 With this normalization, it is a lower bound on the total variation distance between P and Q: : {\\\\rm JSD}(P\\\\parallel Q) \\\\le \\\\frac12\\\\|P-Q\\\\|_1=\\\\frac12\\\\sum_{\\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega}|P(\\\\omega)-Q(\\\\omega)|. For log base e, or ln, which is commonly used in statistical thermodynamics, the upper bound is ln(2): :0 \\\\leq {\\\\rm JSD}( P \\\\parallel Q ) \\\\leq \\\\ln(2) A more general bound, the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence is bounded by \\\\log_{2}(n) for more than two probability distributions, given that one uses the base 2 logarithm. :0 \\\\leq {\\\\rm JSD}_{\\\\pi_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\pi_n}(P_1, P_2, \\\\ldots, P_n) \\\\leq \\\\log_{2}(n)  Relation to mutual information  The Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence is the mutual information between a random variable X associated to a mixture distribution between P and Q and the binary indicator variable Z that is used to switch between P and Q to produce the mixture. Let X be some abstract function on the underlying set of events that discriminates well between events, and choose the value of X according to P if Z = 0 and according to Q if Z = 1, where Z is equiprobable. That is, we are choosing X according to the probability measure M=(P+Q)/2, and its distribution is the mixture distribution. We compute :\\\\begin{align} I(X; Z) &= H(X) - H(X|Z)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\sum M \\\\log M + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[ \\\\sum P \\\\log P + \\\\sum Q \\\\log Q \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\sum \\\\frac{P}{2} \\\\log M - \\\\sum \\\\frac{Q}{2} \\\\log M + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[ \\\\sum P \\\\log P + \\\\sum Q \\\\log Q \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum P \\\\left( \\\\log P - \\\\log M\\\\right ) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum Q \\\\left( \\\\log Q - \\\\log M \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {\\\\rm JSD}(P \\\\parallel Q) \\\\end{align} It follows from the above result that the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence is bounded by 0 and 1 because mutual information is non-negative and bounded by H(Z) = 1. The JSD is not always bounded by 0 and 1: the upper limit of 1 arises here because we are considering the specific case involving the binary variable Z. One can apply the same principle to a joint distribution and the product of its two marginal distribution (in analogy to Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence and mutual information) and to measure how reliably one can decide if a given response comes from the joint distribution or the product distribution‚Äîsubject to the assumption that these are the only two possibilities. Quantum Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence The generalization of probability distributions on density matrices allows to define quantum Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence (QJSD). It is defined for a set of density matrices (\\\\rho_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\rho_n) and a probability distribution \\\\pi=(\\\\pi_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\pi_n) as :{\\\\rm QJSD}(\\\\rho_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\rho_n)= S\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\pi_i \\\\rho_i\\\\right)-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\pi_i S(\\\\rho_i) where S(\\\\rho) is the von Neumann entropy of \\\\rho. This quantity was introduced in quantum information theory, where it is called the Holevo information: it gives the upper bound for amount of classical information encoded by the quantum states (\\\\rho_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\rho_n) under the prior distribution \\\\pi (see Holevo's theorem).. English translation: Probl. Inf. Transm., 9: 177‚Äì183 (1975) Quantum Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence for \\\\pi=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right) and two density matrices is a symmetric function, everywhere defined, bounded and equal to zero only if two density matrices are the same. It is a square of a metric for pure states, and it was recently shown that this metric property holds for mixed states as well. The Bures metric is closely related to the quantum JS divergence; it is the quantum analog of the Fisher information metric. Generalization Nielsen introduced the skew K-divergence: K_\\\\alpha(p||q) = \\\\mathrm{KL}(p||(1-\\\\alpha)p+\\\\alpha q) = \\\\int p(x)\\\\log\\\\frac{p(x)}{(1-\\\\alpha)p(x)+\\\\alpha q(x)} \\\\mathrm{d}x. It follows a one-parametric family of Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergences, called the \\\\alpha- Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergences: \\\\mathrm{JS}_\\\\alpha(p,q) =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(K_\\\\alpha(p||q)+K_\\\\alpha(q||p)\\\\right) = \\\\mathrm{JS}_\\\\alpha(q,p), which includes the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence (for \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1}{2}) and the half of the Jeffreys divergence (for \\\\alpha=1). Applications The Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence has been applied in bioinformatics and genome comparison, in protein surface comparison, in the social sciences, in the quantitative study of history,, fire experiments and in machine learning.

From their beginning in 1994 until they split in 2010, they gained popularity amongst Christian music fans around the world, particularly in the United Kingdom. In 2010, YFriday announced that they were commencing their final months before disbanding later in the same year, after releasing a number of successful albums.  History  The group was formed in 1994, originally as the house band for a monthly evangelistic outreach event run by Youth for Christ called WhyFriday?. The WhyFriday? outreach programme initially had a regular attendance of about 50‚Äì60 young people, but this steadily grew and the event, later called IXth Hour, was held at the Newcastle City Hall for a number of years. At its peak, IXth Hour had around 800 attendees each month and the band still performed there regularly until their split. Following the 1999 release of the Rainmaker album, the band were approached by Kingsway with an offer of a 3-year recording contract. Bassist Danny Smith joined the band in 2001, in time for the Open album. It was at this time that the band members made the decision to leave their jobs to work together full-time. They also released an EP in 2003. From 2007 until 2010, the band supported the event Chesterfest, playing a number of gigs and performing at their \\"Funday on a Sunday\\". In February 2010, YFriday also performed alongside the worship team from Abundant Life Church, Blush and Kev Whitmore at the \\"Heart for Haiti\\" concert supporting the NXT ministries projects in Port-au-Prince after the January 2010 earthquake. The band played at the first Big Church Day out in 2009. YFriday played their final concert as a band in a sold out Newcastle City Hall on 31 October 2010.  Band members  Band membership has changed slightly since the original formation. = Ken Riley = Riley was the lead singer and guitarist of YFriday. He is a prolific songwriter and has collaborated with a number of other Christian songwriters including Matt Redman, Martin Smith (Delirious?) and Tim Hughes.

The first battle is often the one identified as the Battle of High Bridge. On April 6, 1865, Confederate cavalry under Major General Thomas L. Rosser fought stubbornly to secure the South Side Railroad's High Bridge and lower wagon bridge over the Appomattox River near Farmville, Virginia. A large Union Army raiding party intended to destroy the bridges to prevent the Confederate Army from crossing back to the north side of the river. Both sides had several officers killed and wounded. The Union force suffered 42 killed and wounded. The entire surviving Union force of about 800 men was captured. The Confederates suffered about 100 casualties. Union Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Theodore Read and Confederate Colonel Reuben B. Boston were killed. Union Colonel Francis Washburn and Confederate Colonel James Dearing (often identified as a brigadier general but his appointment was never confirmedEicher, David J. The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. . p. 817.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 593.) were mortally wounded in the engagement. On April 7, 1865, Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet's rear guard attempted to burn the bridges that the Confederates had saved the day before in order to prevent Union forces from following them across. Troops of the Union II Corps fought the Confederates assigned to burn the bridges in an effort to drive off the Confederates and save the bridges. Part of the railroad bridge burned and was rendered unusable but Union forces were able to save the wagon bridge over which the II Corps crossed in pursuit of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Failure to destroy this bridge enabled Union forces to catch up with the Confederates north of the Appomattox River at Cumberland Church north of Farmville. Background Another view of the High Bridge High Bridge, long and high, was the crossing of the South Side Railroad over the Appomattox River and its flood plain, northeast of Farmville, Virginia.Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books. Pursuit to Appomattox: The Last Battles. Alexandria, VA: Time-Life Books, 1987. . p. 118. A wooden bridge for wagons was located below the railroad bridge. During the retreat of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the Appomattox Campaign, the Confederates had moved north of the river, except for a rear guard provided by Longstreet's First Corps at Rice's Station on the southern bank. The bridges had to be protected on April 6 and then destroyed on April 7 to delay the pursuit of the Confederates by the Union Army (Army of the Potomac, Army of the James and Army of the Shenandoah) under Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. On April 6, Longstreet dispatched 1,200 Confederate cavalry under Major General Thomas L. Rosser to protect the bridges from Union raiders. Union Major General Edward Ord, commanding the Army of the James, sent about 900 men under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Theodore Read (Ord's chief of staff) to burn the bridge. This force consisted of the 123rd Ohio Infantry and the 54th Pennsylvania Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Horace Kellogg of the 123rd Ohio, and three companies (80 troopers) of the 4th Massachusetts Cavalry under Colonel Francis Washburn. The cavalry reached the bridge before the main Confederate force, chased away some poorly armed home guards, and secured the south end of the bridge.Kennedy, Frances H., ed. The Civil War Battlefield Guide. 2nd ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1998. . pp. 427-28. Battles While Washburn prepared to set fire to the bridge, three brigades of Confederate cavalrymen arrived and conducted a dismounted attack against the Union infantry, which was waiting near the Watson farmhouse, about half mile to the south. Hearing sounds of battle, Washburn and his men rejoined the infantry, and unaware that he was facing two divisions of cavalry, Read ordered a mounted charge by the 4th Massachusetts. The ferocious charge forced through the Confederate line of Colonel Thomas T. Munford and dissolved into hand-to-hand combat. Read exchanged gunfire with Confederate James Dearing during the fighting and was killedTheodore Read at Find a grave. Dearing was mortally wounded and died on April 22. Washburn was also mortally wounded and died 22 April 1865Francis Washburn Find a Grave memorial. The Confederates counterattacked and separated the cavalry from their supporting infantry. After another attack, the Union troopers were surrounded, and all were killed, wounded, or captured. Colonel Reuben B. Boston of the 5th Virginia Cavalry was killed in the attack.Korn, 1987, pp. 118-20.Salmon, 2001, p. 482. Both Read and Washburn received ranks of Brevet Brigadier General. The survivors of the Confederate Second Corps, under Major General John B. Gordon, escaped from their defeat at the Battle of Sailor's Creek and crossed the High Bridge to the north side of the river while Major General William Mahone's division secured the bridge. The rest of Lee's army moved on to Farmville and a rendezvous with trains of rations. Early on April 7, while Mahone's men were attempting to set fire to the High Bridge and wagon bridge, the Union II Corps commanded by Major General Andrew A. Humphreys arrived on the scene. Humphreys's second division under Brigadier General Francis C. Barlow, including the 19th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, charged the burning structure and saved a large section of the railroad bridge, preventing major damage. They crossed the lower wagon bridge to move on Lee's flank and forced the hungry Confederates to resume their retreat before re-provisioning themselves. Aftermath With 47 Union casualties (plus 800 captured) versus only about 100 Confederate casualties, the first battle on the bridge seemed to favor the Confederates. However, the second battle, in which Union troops successfully extinguished the fire, crossed the bridge, and forced the Confederates to flee along a specific path, proved to be a decisive tactical victory, and may have shortened the war by several days.http://www.historynet.com/burning-high-bridge-the-souths-last-hope.htm As a result, Lee was forced to continue his march to the west under pressure, depriving some of his men the opportunity to receive rations from Farmville that they desperately needed. On the night of April 7, Lee received from Grant a letter proposing that the Army of Northern Virginia should surrender. Lee demurred, retaining one last hope that his army could get to Appomattox Station before he was trapped. He returned a noncommittal letter asking about the surrender terms \\"Unconditional Surrender\\" Grant might propose. The next morning, Lee's troops moved toward Appomattox Station, west, where a ration train was expected to be waiting. Union forces were, however, already moving to capture the supply train.

This phenomenon is referred to as substrate coupling or substrate noise coupling. The push for reduced cost, more compact circuit boards, and added customer features has provided incentives for the inclusion of analog functions on primarily digital MOS integrated circuits (ICs) forming mixed- signal ICs. In these systems, the speed of digital circuits is constantly increasing, chips are becoming more densely packed, interconnect layers are added, and analog resolution is increased. In addition, recent increase in wireless applications and its growing market are introducing a new set of aggressive design goals for realizing mixed-signal systems. Here, the designer integrates radio frequency (RF) analog and base band digital circuitry on a single chip. The goal is to make single-chip radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) on silicon, where all the blocks are fabricated on the same chip. One of the advantages of this integration is low power dissipation for portability due to a reduction in the number of package pins and associated bond wire capacitance. Another reason that an integrated solution offers lower power consumption is that routing high-frequency signals off-chip often requires a 50Œ© impedance match, which can result in higher power dissipation. Other advantages include improved high-frequency performance due to reduced package interconnect parasitics, higher system reliability, smaller package count, and higher integration of RF components with VLSI-compatible digital circuits. In fact, the single-chip transceiver is now a reality. The design of such systems, however, is a complicated task. There are two main challenges in realizing mixed-signal ICs. The first challenging task, specific to RFICs, is to fabricate good on-chip passive elements such as high-Q inductors. The second challenging task, applicable to any mixed-signal IC and the subject of this chapter, is to minimize noise coupling between various parts of the system to avoid any malfunctioning of the system. In other words, for successful system-on-chip integration of mixed-signal systems, the noise coupling caused by nonideal isolation must be minimized so that sensitive analog circuits and noisy digital circuits can effectively coexist, and the system operates correctly. To elaborate, note that in mixed-signal circuits, both sensitive analog circuits and high-swing high-frequency noise injector digital circuits may be present on the same chip, leading to undesired signal coupling between these two types of circuit via the conductive substrate. The reduced distance between these circuits, which is the result of constant technology scaling (see Moore's law and the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors), exacerbates the coupling. The problem is severe, since signals of different nature and strength interfere, thus affecting the overall performance, which demands higher clock rates and greater analog precisions. The primary mixed-signal noise coupling problem comes from fast-changing digital signals coupling to sensitive analog nodes. Another significant cause of undesired signal coupling is the Crosstalk (electronics) between analog nodes themselves owing to high-frequency/high-power analog signals. One of the media through which mixed-signal noise coupling occurs is the substrate. Digital operations cause fluctuations in the underlying substrate voltage, which spreads through the common substrate causing variations in the substrate potential of sensitive devices in the analog section. Similarly, in the case of crosstalk between analog nodes, a signal can couple from one node to another via the substrate. This phenomenon is referred to as substrate coupling or substrate noise coupling.  Modelling, analysis, and verification of mixed signal coupling  There is a sizeable literature on substrate, and mixed signal coupling. Some of the most common topics are: *Differentiating between the random noise inherent to electronic devices and the deterministic noise generated by circuits. *Examining the physical phenomena responsible for the creation of undesired signals in a digital circuit and the mechanisms of their transport to other parts of the system. The substrate is the most common coupling mechanism, but capacitive coupling, mutual inductance, and coupling through power supplies are also analyzed. *Comparing various modeling approaches and simulation techniques. There are many possible models for digital noise generation, the substrate impedance network, and the sensitivity of the (unintended) receiver. The chosen techniques significantly influence the speed and accuracy of the analysis. *Substrate and mixed-signal analysis techniques can be applied to placement and power distribution synthesis.

A garments factory, which has state of the art cloth cutting facilities and modern stitching units, manufactures military uniforms and can also cater for the needs of the civil sector\\". Founded in 1951 by the government of Pakistan with early collaboration from the British Royal Ordnance Factory, the POF engineers, develops, produces, manufactures, and promotes a wide range of different types of infantry and special-purpose weapons, explosives, ammunition, mortars, rockets, and the military gear for Pakistan's military. Its corporate leadership comes from a deputation by GHQ where the chief of army staff (COAS) approves the appointment, but POF is under the Ministry of Defense, so the COAS is not in the direct chain of command. The POF is the earliest and one of the largest military corporations in Pakistan, and later influenced many other military corporations in the Pakistan Armed Forces. POF produces ammunition that meets requirements set by NATO specification. Apart from military works, the POF also serves the civilian law enforcement agencies, paramilitary, and private security markets nationwide. History Pakistan Ordnance Factories Old logo During their colonial rule, the British built sixteen ordnance factories in the British Raj, most of which were inherited by India. Pakistan's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, issued a directive within four months of the independence of Pakistan to establish an ordnance factory in collaboration with British Royal Ordnance Factory to manufacture 0.303 calibre rifles. In December 1951 Pakistan's second Prime Minister, Khawaja Nazimuddin, inaugurated the first four POF workshops in the small town of Wah Cantonment. Background Located 45 km from Islamabad and with main manufacturing facilities at Wah Cantonment, POF is a sprawling complex of fourteen production units and six subsidiaries producing conventional arms and ammunition. Research and development projects have been undertaken to minimise dependence on foreign suppliers. Efforts have been made towards self-reliance through innovation and indigenisation, for achieving the following:- 1\\\\. Optimal utilisation of surplus capacity of POF. 2\\\\. Generation of funds to supplement budget grant. 3\\\\. Participative collaboration with the private sector. 4\\\\. Enhancing exports. POF uses technology and equipment that has been acquired from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and China. The factories in POF employ some of the latest state of the art processes, including computerised numerical controlled machines and flexible Manufacturing systems for the production of precision components. A Stamp was also issued by Pakistan Post on the occasion of golden jubilee of POF (Dt. 28 December 2001) to honour the country's largest defence manufacturing unit's services. POF has been awarded standards by the International Organisation for Standardisation. These include ISO 9001 for quality management, ISO 14001 for environmental management, and ISO 17025 for meeting the general requirements for Competence of Test and Calibration Laboratories. In 2005, P.O.F was also awarded with safety and health environment standard OHSAS 18001.

It was first revealed at the 5th International Defence Exhibition and Seminar (IDEAS 2008), held at the Karachi Expo Centre in November 2008. It is designed for SWAT and special forces teams in hostile situations, particularly counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations. It allows its operator to both see and attack an armed target without exposing the operator to counter-attack. Exports In addition to meeting the demands of Pakistan Defense Forces, POF products are in service with over 40 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas. Ammunition and rifles have been exported to countries such as Iraq, Croatia and Afghanistan for their respective military establishments. POF specializes in the manufacturing of commercial explosives, hunting ammunition and possesses extensive facilities for the manufacture of brass, copper and aluminum ingots. A state of the art garments factory, manufactures military uniforms and can also cater for the needs of the civil sector. As of post 2010s, Pakistan has been aiming to push ahead with its export market but facing difficulties due to international guidelines enforced by the United Nations. In 2017, the POF announced it will be opening a branch in the United Arab Emirates and targeting Middle Eastern markets where it will cater not only the needs of the host country, but throughout much of the Middle East where demands are high.

The WB shut down September 17, 2006. Former affiliates of The WB became affiliates of The CW, MyNetworkTV, reverted to independent status, or shut down entirely. Some WB affiliates dropped WB programming on September 5, 2006 in favor of MyNetworkTV. As previously mentioned, from January 1995 to September 2006, Tribune Broadcasting was an investor in The WB Television Network, along with the Warner Bros. division of Time Warner. Tribune held an initial 12.5 percent stake in the network at its launch, and later increased it to 22 percent; most of Tribune's television properties were key WB affiliates but not owned-and- operated stations of the network as Time Warner had controlling interest in it. On January 24, 2006, Warner Bros. Television announced that they would merge The WB with the CBS-owned United Paramount Network to form a new programming service called the CW. All but three of Tribune's WB stations joined the CW on September 18, 2006, through ten-year agreements. Tribune does not have an ownership interest in the CW. In late March 2008 Tribune announced that San Diego affiliate KSWB-TV would switch its network affiliation to Fox in August of that year. The future status of the CW affiliation in San Diego remained unclear until early July when the network named the soon-to-be- displaced Fox affiliate, Tijuana-licensed XETV, as its new affiliate.

Frontispiece by J. B. Carrington 1878 (see \\"External links\\" for more images from the book) An Inland Voyage (1878) is a travelogue by Robert Louis Stevenson about a canoeing trip through France and Belgium in 1876. It is Stevenson's earliest book and a pioneering work of outdoor literature. As a young man, Stevenson desired to be financially independent so that he might pursue the woman he loved, and set about funding his freedom from parental support by writing travelogues, the three most prominent being An Inland Voyage, Travels with a Donkey in the C√©vennes (1879) and The Silverado Squatters (1883). Voyage was undertaken with Stevenson's Scottish friend Sir Walter Grindlay Simpson, mostly along the Oise River from Belgium through France, in the Fall of 1876 when Stevenson was 26 years old. The first part, in Belgium, passed through heavily industrial areas and many canal locks, proving to be not much of a vacation. They then went by rail to France, starting downriver at Maubeuge and ending at Pontoise, close to the Seine. The route itinerary has become a popular route for modern travelers to re-enact with guidebooks and maps available. Stevenson (named \\"Arethusa\\" in the book after his canoe) and Simpson (called \\"Cigarette\\" along with his canoe) each had a wooden canoe rigged with a sail, comparable in style to a modern kayak, known as a \\"Rob Roy\\". They were narrow, decked, and paddled with double-bladed paddles, a style that had recently become popular in England, France, and neighboring countries, inspired by Scottish explorer John MacGregor's book A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe (1866). Outdoor travel for leisure was unusual for the time, and the two Scotsmen were often mistaken for lowly traveling salesman (a status that more than once kept them from a room for the night), but the novelty of their canoes would occasion entire villages to come out and wave along the banks with cheers of \\"come back soon!\\" A fundamentally Romantic work in style and tone, the book paints a delightful atmosphere of Europe in a more innocent time, with quirky innkeepers, traveling entertainers and puppeteers, old men who had never left their villages, ramshackle military units parading with drums and swords, and gypsy-like families who lived on canal barges. The first edition was published by C. Kegan Paul & Co. Since then there have been several editions; a later edition adds an adventure on foot in which Stevenson is thought to be a beggar and is tossed in jail by police, and also a preface by Stevenson's future wife Fanny Vandegrift Osbourne and stepson Lloyd Osbourne, who met him on this journey.

The Flashflight differs from traditional discs (including glow-in-the-dark models also intended for nocturnal usage) in that it has a completely enclosed single ultra-high brightness LED and fiber optics designed to distribute light from the center of the disc to the outer rim. The red light (630 nm wavelength) does not interfere with human night vision, and is visible from all disc angles because all disc surfaces are illuminated - the top deck glows, there is a radiant array on the concave underside, and there are nine bright dots on the perimeter of the rim.

It is on the A719 road some east of Kilmarnock. In 2006 its population was reported as 118. It is represented in the \\"Galston West and Hurlford North\\" ward of East Ayrshire Council. Name The name is thought to be a corruption of \\"Moss-hall\\" or \\"Moss-haw\\" but its spelling was amended in 1812 to mark Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. The name may also be of Brittonic origin, and derived from the words ma…£es, \\"field\\" and coll, \\"hazel\\" (Welsh maes-coll). A stream called the Volga Burn flows through the village. Locally the land and forest around Cowans Law to the north-west is referred to as 'Little Russia'. The hamlet also shares the same latitude (55¬∞ North) as the Russian city. History Walter Emery of the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers had researched the names Moscow, Volga and Ruschaw in 1933. The Ordnance Survey (OS) notified him that the local residents had authorised the name 'Moscow' and that the name appears on Aitken's 1829 map, the valuation role, the Grougar Estate map, and Johnson's 1828 County map. The Ordnance Survey also referred to a local tradition that the name was derived from the burning of Moscow in Russia in 1812, the first house in Moscow in Ayrshire having been built at about that time. Ayr County Council suggested that \\"during the Crimean war there were various refugees and prisoners located in the neighbourhood, and it was then that Russian names were given to various places.\\"Emery, Page 169. Shaw records that \\"a generation ago Russian prisoners of war were located between Galston and Fenwick, at a place called Moscow\\".Shaw, Page 166 In the Spring of 1884 a Mr. Rankin was found murdered in a gruesome fashion at his lonely cottage near Moscow. He was said to be well-to-do, however although no clues were found, theft was considered to be the motive; the guilty party was never brought to book. Mr. McNabb, a retired police officer, related that in his opinion the murder was carried out by a somnambulist who was therefore unaware of the deed. He had never ventured this opinion officially for fear of being laughed out of the force.Aitken, Pages 43-46 Micro-history Recently (2008) a personal airstrip was established in a field near the village for light aircraft. A Geocache is located near the village, just up the road from the Community Woodland.

It began its operations in October 2004 in the UK, and then expanded to Germany, America, Japan and China. Gems TV was formed from the merger of Thaigem Limited and Eagle Road Studios, which formed Gems TV UK Limited, which eventually became a subsidiary of Gems TV Holdings Limited when the company expended to other countries. For the fiscal year ending 30 June 2009, revenues amounted to $162.16 million, down 31% from the previous year, with a gross profit of $53 million.Gems TV Investor Information Since the closure of Gems TV USA and the sale of Gems TV (UK) and Gems London (Gems TV Japan) in 2010, the company no longer focuses on jewellery production and the sales through their own shopping channels. History Gems TV began in October 2004, in the UK from the joint venture of Eagle Road Studios and Thaigem. The partnership came about from Thaigem initially stocking Eagle Road Studios' channel Snatch It! and after the success of the jewellery on the channel, one of Eagle Road's other channels Factory Outlet was replaced with 'Gems.tv'. Eagle Road Studios ran the channel alongside 'Deal Of The Day' and 'Snatch It!'. Gems TV company logo used from 12 May 2005 to 18 January 2008. In April 2005, Eagle Road Studios announced that 'Snatch It!' was to close down and was to be replaced with a second jewellery channel, focusing solely on Sterling Silver after a successful trial run on the channel. During the closing down process of Snatch It!, the new channel was being named 'Gems TV Silver'. However, when the 2nd channel officially launched on 12 May 2005, Gems TV was rebranded as Gems TV Gold and received a completely new identity and studio. The 2nd channel was simply known as 'Gems TV'. Both channels ran alongside 'Deal Of The Day' at the same time was replaced with mobile phone shopping channel; 'MyPhone.tv'. In June 2005, it was announced that both Thaigem and Eagle Road Studios had merged to form 'Gems TV UK Limited' and as a result, on the 19 July 2005, the 'MyPhone.tv channel was sold off to Canis Media Group. Gems TV Holdings was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange in November 2006 and at this time Gems TV employed over 2200 people worldwide dropping to around 1,100 people worldwide by 2010. Jewellery production Gems TV owns its gem production facilities are in Chanthaburi, Thailand. The Gems TV company (now also known by the parent company name of TGGC Limited, or Gemporia) buys cut and polished gems, crafts its products, and then sell them through its various television channels; hence the motto, '[C]utting out the middlemen', and its claim that they can consistently undercut high street prices. The company claims to sell the world's widest variety of gems, including rarities such as Block D Tanzanite. The channel utilizes a falling price - or 'reverse' - auction game. Sale of Gems TV (UK) Limited On 18 June 2010, Gems TV Holdings sold Gems TV (UK) Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary) to The Colourful Company Group Limited, which is the company that owns and runs rival channel Rocks TV, Gem Collector and Jewellery Maker. As a result of the sale, this has now brought Gems TV (UK) Limited back under the ownership of Steve Bennett, who was one of the original founders of the company back in 2004.

Along with Beatrix Farrand and Marian Cruger Coffin, she dictated the style of the time and strongly influenced landscape design as a member of the first generation to break into the largely male occupation. Commenting about the male dominated field to The New York Times in 1938, she said \\"before women took hold of the profession, landscape architects were doing what I call cemetery work.\\" Shipman preferred to look on her career of using plantings as if she \\"were painting pictures as an artist.\\" Little of her work remains today because of the labor-intensive style of her designs, but there exist preserved spaces, including the Sarah P. Duke Gardens at Duke University, often cited as one of the most beautiful American college campuses.\\"The 20 most beautiful campuses in America\\", Conde Nast Traveller, January 29, 2016. #5 of 20: Duke University; picture and caption. She is buried in Plainfield, New Hampshire, near Brook Place, her estate there.\\"Ellen McGowan 'Nellie' Biddle Shipman\\", findagrave.com. Early life Shipman was born in Philadelphia, and she spent her childhood in Texas and the Arizona territory. Her father, Colonel James Biddle, was a career Army officer, stationed on the western frontier. When the safety of his family was threatened, he moved them to the McGowan farm in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Shipman attended boarding school in Baltimore, Maryland, where her interests in the arts emerged and by her twenties she had already started drawing garden designs. When she entered the Harvard annex, Radcliffe College, Shipman met a playwright attending Harvard named Louis Shipman. They left school after one year, married, and moved to Plainfield, New Hampshire, in the Cornish Art Colony, which included Maxfield Parrish and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The colony is said to have been landscaped by artists who were not architects, but had artistically trained eyes and an awareness for the aesthetics of repose, which gave rise to a collection of some of the finest gardens in the country. Shipman took strongly to the Cornish style, one that focused on geometric patterns and colonial plantings, and with it created her own style ‚Äì a style which did not go unnoticed. Collaboration Willard Metcalf, a fellow member of the Cornish Art Colony in Plainfield, painted this while staying with the Shipmans at Brook Place. Ellen and her husband renovated the house in an Italianate Style. Painted here is the original part of the house. Shipman's colleague and fellow member of the Cornish Art Colony, Charles A. Platt, was an artist and architect known for his interest in Italian gardens. Platt recognized Shipman's talents. He did not know much about horticulture, but was highly respected and thought of as \\"the man who could design both house and garden for a country estate\\", for he had recently made a trip to Italy and wrote a book about the gardens there. Chatham Manor, Colonel Daniel Bradford Devore house, 120 Chatham Lane, Fredericksburg. Originally built by William Fitzhugh, 1768-1771, restored, with changes, by Oliver H. Clark for Daniel Bradford Devore, from 1920. Landscape: Ellen Biddle Shipman, from 1922. David Hanlon, gardener By the time the Shipmans divorced in 1910, Ellen Shipman was well on her way to establishing herself as a talented garden designer nationwide. She and Platt played off their mutual requirements: Platt needed Ellen for her knowledge of horticulture and Ellen needed Platt for his knowledge of drafting and design. Shipman was also heavily influenced by Gertrude Jekyll's brilliant use of borders, as well as memories of her grandparents‚Äô farm. By 1920 she was working independently of Platt, though they continued to collaborate on his residential projects. = Designs = Among Shipman's earliest collaborations with Platt was the Cooperstown, New York estate of Fynmere in 1913, owned by the Cooper family on the edge of the village. This project, for descendants of William Cooper, provided significant visibility for Shipman. While the stone mansion was demolished in 1979, a few elements of the landscape work survive. Shipman also designed the adjoining Cooper estate of Heathcote, which is extant today in private hands. A similar task was undertaken at the Gwinn Estate in Cleveland, where she was asked by Platt to aid him and Warren H. Manning in their garden designs. It was finished in 1912, one of her earliest projects, and one where her job was largely planting oriented, filling the designs of Platt with lush flower arrangements. The courtyard gardens of Manhattan's Astor Court Building were another Platt-Shipman collaboration. Platt and Shipman's 1915 design for the Parmelee estate, The Causeway, in Washington D.C. included a Wild Garden surrounding the mansion and formal gardens. It featured mature trees, large clumps of plants such as rhododendron, walking and riding paths, stone bridges and a pond. This, and a substantial one-acre Wild Garden at Longue Vue House and Gardens, are the only surviving examples of Shipman's Wild Gardens. The Causeway is now called Tregaron Estate and is open to the public. Seen in many ways as Platt's prot√©g√©, Shipman was asked on various occasions to rework one of his gardens, including Platt's first major commission, High Court. Located across the road from Platt's own house in Cornish, New Hampshire, Anson Goodyear hired Shipman to revitalize the plantings and reconfigure the garden walls. The reflecting pool at Stan Hywet Hall, Akron, Ohio, 1929 Her other significant gardens include the Bayou Bend Gardens, Longue Vue Gardens in New Orleans, Stan Hywet Gardens, the Graycliff Estate (now under restoration), Stranahan Estate (also under reconstruction), Middleton House and Robert M. Hanes House at Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Duke University's Sarah P. Duke Gardens, which is often named one of her finest works. Shipman created her own residential gardens all over the United States, collaborating with many architects. Her planting plans softened the bones of geometric architecture with planting designs that were muscular enough to speak for themselves. She once said, \\"Remember that the design of your place is its skeleton upon which you will later plant to make your picture. Keep that skeleton as simple as possible.\\" Public recognition and solo work Shipman designed The Moonlight Garden at the Edison and Ford Winter Estates in Fort Myers, Florida for Thomas Edison's wife Mina. Shipman's gardens often appeared in magazines, including House Beautiful. In 1933, House & Garden named her the \\"Dean of Women Landscape Architects\\". She lectured widely, and completed over 400 projects. Her archives are at Cornell University. Because much of her work includes labor-intensive plantings and borders, many have not survived. However, it was because of these borders that she was able to connect with her female clientele. Her intent was to provide privacy and a place for interaction with the surroundings. Women found the gardens provided familiarity and comfort. It is said that throughout the 40 years she practiced landscape architecture, Shipman would only hire graduates from Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture, Gardening, and Horticulture for Women. Although it is not thoroughly understood why this was her hiring practice, it is widely believed that because of the time, women were not being given apprenticeships in male offices.

The novel is the first in a trilogy known as the Welsh Princes series set in medieval England, Wales and France that feature the Plantagenet kings.  Plot  Here Be Dragons is the first of Penman's trilogy about the medieval princes of Gwynedd and the monarchs of England. England's King John uses his out-of-wedlock daughter Joanna as a negotiating tool by marrying her to the Welsh noble Llewelyn to avoid war between England and Wales. Joanna and Llewelyn's marriage is marred by resentment from Llewelyn's illegitimate son, Gruffydd. Joanna gives birth to two legitimate children, Elen and Dafydd. Growing animosity between the English and Welsh results in Joanna having to act as a diplomatic intermediary between her husband and her father, and the situation deteriorates when Gruffydd is taken hostage by John and narrowly escapes execution. Joanna becomes determined that her own son, Dafydd, will be his father's heir as ruler of Gwynedd, disregarding the Welsh law that all sons should receive equal shares of their father's inheritance. Family disagreements lead Joanna into an affair with William de Braose, who is several years her junior and whom she has met earlier in the story when he was a hostage in Llewelyn's household. Their affair is discovered and William is executed. Joanna is placed in secluded captivity, but at the end of the book Llewelyn comes to find her and offers her forgiveness.  Style and genre  Penman utilizes characters who are in conflict and develops them well. Penman's characterizations are strong, with innocuous historical figures added to the story. She takes the slight historical mention of a character, such as Llewelyn's brother Adda, and adds him to the story, about whom she says, \\"All we know of Adda is his name.\\" Llewelyn's seneschal Ednyfed Fychan, the forebear of King Henry VII, is important as Llewelyn's trusted friend. Of Fychan, Penman remarks: \\"I can't recall a time when I didn't know that Ednyfed was the ancestor of Henry Tudor. I assume I must have encountered that fact early in my research. Despite his dubious descendants, I was rather fond of Ednyfed as a character.\\" Although set in the 12th and 13th centuries, narrative in her novels takes place in medieval sites that still exist and can be visited, including castles, churches and archeological areas. Areas such as Aber Falls and Dolwyddelan Castle have important scenes in Here Be Dragons. The possible remains of the Palace have recently been excavated in Abergwyngregyn. In a discussion about teaching with historical fiction, scholars Alun Hicks and Dave Martin note that Penman is careful to make the details of her novel reflect the needs of the genre, talking about objects and practices which give the reader historical immersion.  Themes  Penman juxtaposes the central love story between Joanna and Llewelyn the Great against a tapestry of medieval conventions, wars for territory, and the conflict between Llewelyn's fight to maintain an independent Wales and to appease the English King John. Of her research and characterization of Joanna, Penman explains: \\"All we know about Joanna ... are the bedrock facts about her life. I took those facts and did my best to breathe life into them, seeking to create a woman who would have acted as we know she did. ... Joanna is a rare exception, a woman who made an impact upon her times and who is still remembered today in Wales as Llewelyn's Siwan.\\" In the early 1980s, Penman moved to the Welsh mountains to conduct research for the novel. In particular, Penman's characters are strong individuals, sometimes, as some reviewers pointed out, too strong. However, Rhian Piprell looks to Penman's treatment of Joan as a reminder that the idea of women wielding power and being influential is not a something unique to the modern world. Penman explains in an interview: \\"I think Dragons ... was virgin territory for most readers. The saga of the Plantagenets was much better known, but not many people were familiar with medieval Wales or its princes. And then, too, the story of Llewelyn and Joanna, King John‚Äôs illegitimate daughter, is a remarkable one, which struck an emotional chord with many readers.\\"  Reception  One critic wrote of Here Be Dragons that although it is a \\"good solid book\\" the 700 page read \\"lacks magic\\". The review in Library Journal cautions readers about the book's slow start, and confusing use of names, but concedes the novel is \\"involving\\" and \\"enjoyable.\\" Moreover, the reviewer believes Joanna's character lacks depth, but other characters \\"are bigger than life.\\" New York Times Book Review was critical of list-like story telling which is too \\"brisk\\" and a tendency for tropes which slow the reader down too much. Other reviews are positive. For example, School Library Review claims Here Be Dragons \\"keeps readers enthralled,\\" and that the novel is a \\"wonderful melange of historical fiction.\\" A Publishers Weekly review of one of Penman's subsequent books, describes Penman's writing as a \\"magnificent combination of history and humanity that Penman's readers have come to expect again animates her latest work (after Here Be Dragons)\\".

He is chiefly known for his marriage (later invalidated by Henry) to Lady Margaret Douglas (1515‚Äì1578), the daughter of Henry VIII's sister, Margaret Tudor, for which he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he died on 31 October 1537. The affair is referenced in a verse by his nephew, the poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. Early life Howard was a younger son of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk by his second marriage to Agnes Tilney.; . He was a half-brother of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, son of the 2nd duke by his first marriage, and is often confused with his elder brother. Lord Thomas was at court in 1533 when his niece, Anne Boleyn, married King Henry VIII as his second wife, and helped to bear the canopy at the christening of Anne's daughter, Elizabeth. In the years which followed he was often at court, and it was there that he met Lady Margaret Douglas (1515‚Äì1578), the daughter of Henry VIII's sister, Margaret Tudor, and her second husband, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus (c. 1489 ‚Äì 1557). By the end of 1535 Lord Howard and Lady Margaret Douglas had fallen in love and become secretly engaged.; . Imprisonment and death Howard's niece, Queen Anne, fell from power in May 1536. This undoubtedly contributed to the King's fury when in early July 1536 he learned of the marriage contract of Lord Thomas and Lady Margaret since Lady Margaret was at the time next in the line of succession as a result of the King's bastardization of his daughters Mary and Elizabeth. The couple were committed to the Tower, and on 18 July 1536 an Act of Attainder accusing Howard of attempting to 'interrupt ympedyte and lett the seid Succession of the Crowne' was passed in both houses of Parliament. The Act sentenced Howard to death, and forbade the marriage of any member of the King's family without his permission.. The death sentence was not carried out, and Lord Thomas languished in the Tower despite the fact that Lady Margaret was required to renounce their relationship by King Henry's minister Thomas Cromwell. While in the Tower Lady Margaret fell ill, and the King allowed her to be moved to Syon Abbey under the supervision of the abbess. There are many reports that her illness was her pregnancy with Lord Thomas Howard's son and thus she was sent to the Abbey during her confinement. She was released from the Abbey on 29 October 1537. Howard remained in the Tower, where he caught an illness and died on 31 October 1537. There is an unsubstantiated tradition that he was poisoned. His body was given to his mother, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk, with the stipulation that it be buried 'without pomp'. Howard was interred at Thetford Abbey.; . In 1540 Lady Margaret Douglas was disgraced in a similar affair with Thomas Howard's nephew Sir Charles Howard, the son of Lord Thomas's elder half-brother Lord Edmund Howard, and a brother of Henry VIII's fifth wife, Katherine Howard.; . Poem Lord Thomas's nephew, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, referred to his death in a poem to \\"his Geraldine\\" (Lady Elizabeth Fitsgerald):‚Äî If you be fair and fresh, am I not of your hue? And for my vaunt I dare well say, my blood is not untrue; For you yourself doth know, it is not long ago Sith that for love one of the race did end his life in woe, In Tower both strong and high, for his assured truth, Whereas in tears he spent his breath, alas, the more the ruth! This gentle beast so died, whom nothing could remove, But willingly to seek his death for loss of his true love.

Early life and acting career Sullivan is a native of San Francisco who began his career as a child actor. He grew up in St. Francis Square in the Fillmore district of San Francisco as the youngest of three children. His father was a bus driver, and his mother was a receptionist for the St. Mary's hospital. According to Sullivan, he was \\"one step up from a housing project\\".Fenjves, Pablo F., and Rocky Lang. How I Broke into Hollywood: Success Stories from the Trenches. New York: Regan, 2006. Print. During sixth grade while performing A Midsummer Night's Dream, Sullivan's talents were picked up by Ann Brebner, who placed him and his entire class as extras in a movie by Sidney Poitier, They Call Me Mr. Tibbs! in 1970. This was his first experience with cinema. Brebner would continue to give him auditions for various roles. In 1970, he was picked up for a job in an Alpha-Bits Cereal commercial, making over $7,000 off of that role alone. He continued to obtain small roles in theater productions and doing commercials. Most notably, He got a role as the Master of Ceremonies during a show of Sesame Street that was being filmed live at Golden Gate Park. He was made to \\"sit on this big garbage can with a microphone and introduce the various skits,\\" with Jim Henson controlling the puppets. Sullivan then went on to get a part in a movie called Thumb Tripping, with Meg Foster, following which he got a part in a series called Wee Pals on the Go. The series was based on a comic strip by Morrie Turner and featured an integrated neighborhood. He played the part of Randy, \\"a kid with a big afro who loved sports,\\" according to Sullivan. For Christmas, the producer of that series gave Sullivan his first 8-millimeter camera with which he first experimented in film. He acquired a scholarship to St. Ignatius College Preparatory, which was a Jesuit all-boys high school located in the Sunset District of San Francisco. \\"The school had 1,200 boys, only forty of them were black,\\" according to Sullivan. At St. Ignatius, Sullivan was challenged in his class work for the first time, and because of his race, was barred from the theater program as well. \\"I felt out of place and no one tried to make me feel otherwise,\\" Says Sullivan. At one point he joined the Young Conservatory of the American Theater, located in downtown San Francisco. As a senior at St. Ignatius, he convinced the theater department to allow him to direct Ceremonies in Dark Old Men, by Lonne Elder; and following this, the school asked him to be the lead in a production of The Tea House of the August Moon. Due to his successes in his acting career, Sullivan applied to the Juilliard School in New York, which emphasizes the arts. John Houseman, who had at the time recently received an Oscar for his role in The Paper Chase, was his interviewer. Houseman's comments on Sullivan's abilities at the time were thus: \\"You have talent, but you're only seventeen years old. Most of our students come here after four years of college. I don't think you're ready for New York City just yet\\". And so, Sullivan ended up at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon instead, where he was offered a scholarship through their theater program. He applied to be an English major, as he was growing increasingly interested in writing. \\"I was a whale in a fish bowl,\\" says Sullivan, who was quite overqualified for the college's theater program. He ended up being the lead, Proteus, in Two Gentlemen of Verona, for which he had only auditioned as a supporting role. Sullivan was in quite a few plays following that, and was chosen by the school to direct a production of Slow Dance on the Killing Ground, a play by William Hanley. He then decided to produce a play of his own creation, leaving the school to do it as an independent study. He never went back. In the summer of 1987, Sullivan left for Los Angeles. He began by working with a friend and fellow actor in Hollywood. From there he began to write scripts. On a particular four-day trip to DC, he picked up inspiration for characters in his later works from fellow passengers on his ride who he'd spent time talking to. While his scripts were largely unnoticed, his trip would inspire later works. In the meantime, however, his acting was noticed after he auditioned for small parts in a few movies, including as Lieutenant in More American Graffiti (1979), Tyrone in Night Shift (1982), March in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), and John Grant in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984). Early screenwriting At the age of twenty-two when he was able to sell a television script for the first time, it was for an episode of Fame for the ABC network. This connection to ABC allowed him to write the TV drama series Knightwatch in 1988. In 1992, Sullivan directed the pilot for a television series on ABC entitled Moe's World, which is a story narrated by a kid who has been killed in a car crash. The story \\"tackled\\" topics such as teenage pregnancy and death as well as other topics that tend to affect teenagers today. Handy, Debra. Variety and Daily Variety Television Reviews, 1991-1992: Volume 17. New York: Garland, 1994. Print. However, while ABC bought the pilot, the show was never picked up by that network. Fox considered purchasing the show as well, but did not follow through. Despite that minor setback, this background allowed Sullivan to jump into directing movies for HBO: the short film \\"Long Black Song\\", which was one of three in the America's Dream (1996) anthology movie, and Soul of the Game (1996). The later was a docudrama on how African Americans \\"broke the baseball color barrier\\" which follows the \\"triumphant and tragic stories\\" of Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige, and Josh Gibson as they make their way out of the Negro Leagues, and into the Majors. Ribowsky, Mark. Josh Gibson: the Power and the Darkness. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2004. Print. \\"For African Americans in this century,\\" Sullivan told The New York Times regarding Soul of the Game, \\"one man's victory is often the result of others paving the way, sometimes making the triumph both bitter and sweet\\". The movie was eventually pulled from air and is no longer available on television. Sullivan's successes presented him with many opportunities, including the ability to collaborate with George Lucas on Red Tails, a story about the Tuskegee airmen, a famous African American Aerial unit from World War II; as well as with Norman Jewison on an adaptation of The Good Times Are Killing Me.Kevin Rodney Sullivan - Filmbug Kevin Rodney Sullivan In addition to these series, Sullivan also produced Frank's Place (1987), I'll Fly Away (1991), Boy Meets Girl (1993), and Cosmic Slop (1994), before his first major production.Kevin Rodney Sullivan The National Name Database: Kevin Rodney Sullivan Major film productions The movie How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998) swept the NAACP Image Awards, won the award for Outstanding Picture and was Kevin Rodney Sullivan's Hollywood directorial debut. The movie was based on a popular novel at the time, and follows the story of Stella (played by Angela Bassett) who is a single mother of one who finds love in Jamaica with a man much younger than her named Winston (played by Taye Diggs). It also had other notable stars such as Whoopi Goldberg, who plays Stella's best friend in the movie. Donalson, Melvin Burke. Black Directors in Hollywood. Austin, TX: University of Texas, 2003. Print. The film, while not the first to use a tropic paradise as its background, \\"may be the first to blatantly portray a tropical paradise as a sexual mecca beckoning tired American businesswomen to shed their clothes and inhibitions,\\" according to a review by The New York Times.FILM REVIEW - FILM REVIEW - He Likes Video Games? Nobody's Perfect - Review - NYTimes.com The New York Times. By Stephen Holden Despite some mixed reviews, Sullivan still \\"provides a movie that speaks in a recognizable way to a black audience, particularly black women who have found themselves omitted from serious screen depiction over the decades\\". Sullivan's next major production was Conviction (2002), based on the autobiography of Carl Upchurch entitled Convicted in the Womb. The movie wrestles with race relations, and issues pertaining to jail and gang violence, as well as the use of derogatory terms towards people of African descent. The main character, after being reformed in jail goes on a mission to help lower youth violence in America, by inviting all the largest gang's leaders to a church meeting about violence. Upchurch himself had a cameo within the movie as a jail cell guard. He then went on to produce Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2004), which was a sequel to the original Barbershop (2002), with the entire original cast returning with some additions. Notable cast members include: Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer, Anthony Anderson, and a brief cameo by Queen Latifah in promotion of her own spinoff of the Barbershop franchise. The latest major film production by Kevin Sullivan was Guess Who (2005); the idea for the movie was originally a collaborative effort by Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac. As Kutcher explained in an interview about his choice of directors, \\"I had a conversation with Kevin before we started the movie. And the reason that I liked Kevin -- we picked Kevin to do the movie, Bernie and I did, because what he knew the movie needed was heart. And he was more concerned about the heart than the comedy\\".Ashton Kutcher Interview - Punk'd, Guess Who, That 70s Show Hollywood Movies: An Interview with Ashton Kutcher The movie focuses on a young white man (played by Kutcher) attempting to marry an African American woman, while trying to seek the approval of her overprotective father (played by Bernie Mac). Working with Sullivan did have its impact upon the film, as Kutcher explains, \\"Well, working for Kevin Sullivan was a very different experience for me. Kevin didn't just let us go. At no point in time did Kevin just let us go... And I think that that brought a different performance for each of us from what we'd done before\\". The movie received mostly mixed reviews. Recent screenwriting In the four years between How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Conviction, Sullivan wrote and collaborated with the producers of The West Wing (2000), which followed a fictional White House staff about on various fictional activities. Sullivan then developed a pilot for the series Watching Ellie (2002), and wrote some scripts for The Guardian (2002) which was a crime drama that ran for two seasons. Following the release of Conviction, he began working on scripts for The Henry Lee Project (2003). This series followed a veteran policeman turned private detective. The part of the policeman was played by notable actor Danny Glover. The most notable of his recent screenplays is 30 Rock (2008), which has received national acclaim and many awards including Emmy awards for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The show was renewed by NBC for a sixth season in 2010. Tina Fey was the original project writer, and created the storyline to be based on her own life story. Sullivan collaborated with three other producers, including Alec Baldwin on this show, especially on the second season. However, despite winning awards for being an outstanding comedy, 30 Rock has been chronically underrated throughout its six seasons of being on air, with a viewership of nearly 5.3 million viewers.

A novelisation based on the script was published in 1989 by Target Books, as the first volume of its Missing Episodes series. The script and novelisation were written by former series producer Graham Williams, and would have been directed by Matthew Robinson had it gone to air. It is the first novel-length text featuring The Doctor not to be based upon a previously transmitted production, although being a novelisation it is not strictly speaking an \\"original\\" novel. An audio play closely based on Williams' script was released in May 2003, with profits going to the charity Sense. For this adaptation, the Sixth Doctor was played by Steve Hill, and Peri by Jennifer Adams Kelley. A second audio adaption, done by Big Finish, was released in 2009. Adapted by John Ainsworth, it featured both Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant reprising their television roles of the Sixth Doctor and Peri respectively. Synopsis The TARDIS falls through a time well, landing in modern-day Blackpool at an amusement fair. The Doctor and Peri, finding nothing else amiss, start to enjoy the fair's attractions. They are separated on an amusement ride; the Doctor's car is directed into the depths of the fair, while Peri encounters Kevin, a teenaged-boy looking for his brother who is missing but had last been seen at the fair weeks ago. The two are also eventually captured and brought to a prison where the Doctor has also been caged. They discover their captor is the Celestial Toymaker, who has been stuck on Earth for several millennia, tricking a few unsuspecting humans into playing games with him and losing, become his perpetual servants. The Toymaker created the time well to bring the Doctor here, and added elements to the fair to help capture the Doctor. The Toymaker is on the verge of completing his \\"great work\\": an arcade game that feeds on the souls that lose to it, which then can generate powerful creatures with which the Toymaker plans to take over Earth. He is prepared to have the game mass-produced in America to complete his plan. The Doctor, who knows that the Time Lords do not fully know who or what the Toymaker is, learns that he is a powerful psychic being from another dimension where time moves much slower, giving him his seemingly immortality. Knowing that he cannot hurt the Toymaker physically, he works with Peri, Kevin, a Venusian engineer and a human android who is also one of the Toymaker's captives, to construct a device to disrupt the Toymaker's psychic field. The Doctor then traps him in a time field of his device that prevents the Toymaker from being able to control anyone outside of it and that will last forever. The other creatures captured by the Toymaker are freed, including Kevin's brother. The Doctor decides to return with Peri back to enjoy the fair a bit more. Background Several stories were in the planning stages for the 23rd Season of Doctor Who, three of which were in the middle of being scripted when the (temporary) cancellation announcement was made. Former series Producer Graham Williams was to have written the season opener, featuring a return of the Celestial Toymaker as seen in the 1966 serial. Being the first slated for production, Williams script was by far the most advanced at the time of cancellation, with Matthew Robinson (who had helmed Resurrection of the Daleks and Attack of the Cybermen in the previous two seasons) pencilled in as director. Intended Production Studio days were booked for this story to be recorded, starting on 20 May 1985. Location filming was also planned to take place in Blackpool at the Pleasure Beach, on the promenade and at south shore police station.https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/retro/dr-whos- abandoned-blackpool-adventure-2888537 The story however was never produced due to Doctor Who first being cancelled by the BBC, then this being revised to an 18-month break, with all planned storylines being junked and a new, shorter season being assembled for transmission in September 1986.Doctor Who- The Lost Season (dvd documentary)- retrieved October 2008 Novelisation In 1988, Target Books, which had been successfully publishing novelisations of Doctor Who stories for many years, saw itself running out of available televised materiala. Although a number of serials remained unadapted, most were off- limits due to licensing problems. While negotiations went forward with the BBC for the publication of new adventures, three of the cancelled scripts were published in book form. The writers of all three were approached, and all were signed to write the novels. The Nightmare Fair required far less additional material than the other two, and in May 1989 it became the first to be published under the Missing Episodes banner. It was the first of 275 releases from different publishers as of 2007 that were not televised or broadcast on radio (the novelisation of the radio story Slipback had been published in 1986). The next two books in the series were The Ultimate Evil by Wally K. Daly, released in August 1989, and Mission to Magnus by Philip Martin, published in July 1990 (the first Doctor Who novel based on non-televised material to be published after the end of the original series). =Notes= *The original ending of the 1985 series finale, Revelation of the Daleks, had the Doctor telling Peri he was going to take her to Blackpool. Before broadcast, however, the decision was made to freeze frame the Doctor before he says this. Williams' novelisation of the serial does not, therefore, take its lead from the original ending of Revelation. At the start of this novel TARDIS is drawn into \\"the nexus of the primeval cauldron of Space-Time itself\\" and he and Peri are surprised to find themselves in Blackpool. *The Past Doctor Adventures novel Divided Loyalties ends with the Toymaker telling his companion Stefan \\"I'll take you to Blackpool\\", both setting up this story and pastiching the original end of Revelation. *In the text of the novel, the character Kevin is given the surname Stoney. Kevin Stoney is the name of an actor who appeared in earlier stories in the televised series. Big Finish audio play Big Finish Productions produced an audio drama adaptation of The Nightmare Fair in 2009.https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/heritage-and- retro/retro/dr-whos-abandoned-blackpool-adventure-2888537 In early March 2009, Big Finish announced that the role of the Toymaker was to be played by David Bailie, who had previously played Dask in the 1977 story The Robots of Death.

Background Richard II rewarded those who had supported him against Gloucester and the Lords Appellant with a plethora of new titles. Upon the usurpation and accession of King Henry IV in 1399, many of those titles were placed under attainder, due to the complicity of their holders in the murder of the Duke of Gloucester. Conspiracy The ringleaders of the conspiracy were John Montagu, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, John Holland, 1st Earl of Huntingdon (formerly Duke of Exeter) and half-brother to Richard II, Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent (formerly Duke of Surrey), and Thomas le Despenser, 4th Baron le Despencer (formerly Earl of Gloucester). Other members included Edward of Norwich, 1st Earl of Rutland (formerly Duke of Aumale), Ralph Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley, Sir Thomas Blount and Sir Bernard Brocas. They met on 17 December 1399 at the Abbey house in Westminster and plotted to capture the new King Henry IV while he was at Windsor for the feast of Epiphany. They hoped to seize the king during a tournament, kill him, and restore Richard II to the throne. However, Edward of Norwich betrayed the conspirators to King Henry, although according to Tait, contemporary English sources which describe the conspiracy make no mention of Rutland, and his role in it is open to doubt. Nevertheless, forewarned, Henry failed to appear at Windsor and began to raise an army in London. Kent and Salisbury arrived at the castle with a force of about 400 men-at-arms and archers, but hearing that the king, forewarned, was no longer there, quickly left. Aftermath The conspirators fled to the western counties and raised the standard of rebellion. However, they obtained little support and were quickly apprehended by local authorities. While attempting to seize Cirencester, Lumley was beheaded in a short but violent skirmish by the townsfolk and Salisbury and Kent were captured. Held briefly in custody, they were abruptly beheaded without trial on 7 January 1400. Le Despencer was captured at Bristol by a mob and was also summarily beheaded on 13 January 1400. Huntingdon was captured at Pleshey and dealt with likewise on 16 January 1400. Blount escaped to Oxford, where he was hanged, drawn and quartered on 12 January 1400. Brocas was captured in Cirencester and beheaded at Tyburn. Those executed were subsequently attainted in March; the brother of Kent and the sons of Salisbury and Huntingdon were later restored to their fathers' titles. The attainders were formally reversed in 1461 by a Yorkist parliament. The rebellion also convinced Henry IV that a deposed, imprisoned and alive King Richard was a very dangerous liability for him. The deposed monarch would come to his death 'by means unknown' in Pontefract Castle by 17 February 1400.

They emerged from the UK anarcho-punk scene with a guitar/bass/drums line-up, but also incorporated trumpet and other instruments not commonly found in punk music at that time. Their composition style incorporated many genres of music outside of rock, including folk, jazz, ambient and noise music with often unorthodox instrumentation. History =1980s= Dog Faced Hermans formed in Edinburgh, Scotland out of the female-fronted funk-punk sextet Volunteer Slavery, named after an album by Rahsaan Roland Kirk. Londoner Andy Moor, who was studying anthropology in Edinburgh, first met Colin McLean at a benefit for the Scottish Campaign to Remove the Atomic Menace, and the two shared a love of James Brown, free jazz, reggae, and African music. McLean owned both a guitar and a bass, which he traded off with Moor, eventually setting on who was to play which in the band after realizing that the songs they liked best were the ones with McLean on bass and Moor on guitar. Wilf plum had been moonlighting with local noise bands Finitribe and Stretchheads, and Marion Coutts took time off from her studies at Edinburgh College of Art to play trumpet, and the whole group also took to banging on oil drums and other percussion. They band got their new name from a scene in a Frankenstein movie, \\"where a woman dreams that her husband, whose name is Herman, gets turned into a dog.\\" When the group started, they played primarily improvised music, \\"like bashing oil drums and hitting the guitars without actually playing very many tunes,\\" according to drummer Wilf Plum. The group's longer improvisations were condensed into shorter arranged songs that maintained their experimental qualities. The Hermans' line-up stayed constant throughout their tenure, with Marion Coutts fronting the band on vocals, trumpet and percussion, Andy Moor on guitar, Colin Mclean on bass, and Wilf Plum on drums. Within their first three years as a band, the Hermans recorded and released a few singles and two albums on their own Demon Radge Records and on journalist Everett True‚Äôs label, Calculus.Strong, Martin C.: \\"The Great Alternative & Indie Discography\\", 1999, Canongate, These early records demonstrated the breadth of the band's influences, including English and Scottish post-punk, American no wave, and various styles of folk music, exemplified in their renditions of the Italian partisan song \\"Bella Ciao\\" and the blues standard \\"John Henry\\". While in the UK, the Dog Faced Hermans made numerous appearances on the BBC, recording three songs for The John Peel Show in 1987 and appearing on the TV programme FSD in 1988. =1990s= The group found affinity in Dutch anarchist group The Ex, whom they'd been introduced to through members of Chumbawamba. The Ex and Dog Faced Hermans toured Europe, the United States, and Canada together and released the single \\"Stonestamper's Song\\" under the name Ex Faced Hermans, a split live cassette, and began a longstanding collaboration with the free jazz ensemble Instant Composers Pool. The Dog Faced Hermans also served as the backing band for Kurdish musician Brader with whom The Ex had also collaborated. By 1990 the Dog Faced Hermans relocated to Amsterdam taking on The Ex's sound engineer Gert Jan as a member of the group, and in 1991 Andy Moor joined The Ex, and for some years played guitar for both bands. The Hermans struck up a deal with the Dutch label Konkurrent for the release of 1991's Mental Blocks for All Ages and 1993's Hum of Life, which featured covers of songs by free jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman and American no wave group 8 Eyed Spy. Part of the lead track, \\"Jan 9\\", is lifted from the Rumanian folk tune \\"Rumelaj\\". An American fan of the group, Geoffery Treistadt from Minneapolis band Jonestown, released the Hermans' records simultaneously in North America on his tiny Project A Bomb label. Seeking wider distribution, the Hermans approached former Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra who released the Hermans' final studio and live albums on his Alternative Tentacles label before the group disbanded in 1995. About the break-up, Andy Morr later said, \\"As a four-piece band, we had said what we had to say.\\" The Hermans gave their final three concerts in San Francisco in October 1995, having played nearly 450 gigs in their decade as a band. = Post-Hermans= Wilf Plum went to drum for the Canadian ensemble Rhythm Activism and the projects Two Pin Din and Orchestre Tout Puissant Marcel Duchamp. Andy Moor continues to play with The Ex as a permanent member, as well as numerous other projects. Colin McLean also toured with The Ex as the band's live sound engineer and played bass for their collaboration with Ethiopian saxophonist Getatchew Mekuria. Marion Coutts returned to the UK, dedicating herself to making and teaching visual art and writing books, with a few brief sojourns into playing and recording music. Sound engineer Gert Jan toured with The Ex for many years, as well as the bands Red Monkey and Zea.

It has been preserved in the National Museum of American History, because it was where the series of Greensboro sit-ins, protests against racial segregation caused by Jim Crow laws, began. A drugstore lunch counter in Hermiston, Oregon A lunch counter (also known as a luncheonette) is a small restaurant, similar to a diner, where the patron sits on a stool on one side of the counter and the server or person preparing the food serves from the opposite side of the counter, where the kitchen or limited food preparation area is located. As the name suggests, they were primarily used for the lunch meal. Lunch counters were once commonly located inside retail variety stores (\\"five and dimes\\" or \\"five and tens\\" as they were called in the United States) and smaller department stores. The intent of the lunch counter in a store was to profit from serving hungry shoppers, and to attract people to the store so that they might buy merchandise. History Woolworth's, an early five and dime chain of stores, opened their first luncheonette in New Albany, Indiana around 1923, and expanded rapidly from there.Barksdale, David C. & Sekula, Robyn Davis (2005). New Albany in Vintage Postcards, p. 2; Lunch counters were often found in other dimestores, like Newberry's, S. H. Kress, H.L. Green, W.T. Grant, McLellan's or McCrory's. Members of the retail staff who had taken lunch counter training would staff the counter during lunch time. Typical foods served were hot and cold sandwiches (e.g., ham and cheese, grilled cheese, BLT, patty melt, egg salad), soups, pie, ice cream (including sundaes, ice cream sodas and milkshakes), soda, coffee and hot chocolate. During the Civil Rights Movement Integrating lunch counters in the Southern United States through the use of sit-in political protests in the 1960s was a major accomplishment of the Civil Rights Movement. These involved African Americans and their supporters sitting at the lunch counter in areas designated for \\"whites only\\", insisting that they be served food and beverages. The Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina was the site of one of the first such sit-ins in 1960. In recognition of its significance, part of the Greensboro lunch counter has been installed at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, while the former Woolworth's building is now the site of International Civil Rights Center and Museum.

He was the last surviving cardinal elevated by Pope Pius XI, and his cardinalate of forty-eight years was the longest since the fifty-eight-year cardinalate of Henry Benedict Mary Clement Stuart of York which lasted from 1747 to 1805. He took part in three conclaves: in 1939, 1958 and 1963. Although there were seven other cardinals elevated by Pius XI who participated in the 1963 conclave, Cerejeira was the longest-serving living cardinal from the death of Jozef-Ernest van Roey on 6 August 1961 until his own death almost exactly sixteen years later. Family Cerejeira was the eldest of three sons and four daughters of Avelino Gon√ßalves Cerejeira (1857Baptised in Vila Nova de Famalic√£o, Lousado, on 16 April 1857. ‚Äì 1927), a merchant from Lugar da Serra, and his wife, Joaquina Gon√ßalves Rebelo (1864Baptised in Fafe, (S√£o Bartolomeu de) Vila Cova, on 1 June 1864 ‚Äì 1918). His mother had resided at the Parish of Lousado since her childhood and became a country woman (i.e., a peasant woman) upon marriage. Manuel's younger brothers were J√∫lio (b. 1901), a medical doctor, Joaquim, a lawyer, and Ant√≥nio, a university employee. One of his younger sisters was a nun and one was called Carolina.Fotobiografias do S√©culo XX, Photobiography of Cardinal Cerejeira, C√≠rculo de Leitores Early life He was educated at the seminary in Braga from a young age and became a priest in 1911. Following his ordination, he became a faculty member of the University of Coimbra, during which time he became a respected and revered intellectual and religious figure. He also met Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar and the two later became leading figures in the Centro Acad√©mico de Democracia Crist√£ (Academic Centre for Christian Democracy), which supported the Catholic Church's social doctrine. Career RVCMBSM) In 1928, Cerejeira became a bishop and was elevated to the patriarchate of Lisbon the following year, at the age of forty-one. He replaced Ant√≥nio Mendes Belo, who had experienced two very different periods during his twenty-year cardinalate: a time of anti- church hostility in the first years of the Portuguese republic and a more church-friendly climate following the military coup of 1926. Cerejeira was appointed cardinal a month after his appointment as patriarch. At the time of his elevation, he became the youngest member of the College of Cardinals. The closest approach was made by Ant√≥nio Ribeiro, his successor as Patriarch of Lisbon, who was made a cardinal in 1973, three months before his forty-fifth birthday. During his extraordinarily long career as Portugal's leading Catholic churchman, Cerejeira often became associated with the authoritarian right-wing Estado Novo. This was the result of his friendship with Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, who had been a university colleague of his at Coimbra, and his endorsement of many of the Estado Novo's policies. He signed the Concordat of 1940 between Portugal and the Catholic Church. However, although he was considered a conservative, he accepted the Vatican Council II reforms more readily than Salazar. He was criticized for not being more vocal on his support of the Bishop of Porto, Ant√≥nio Ferreira Gomes, who was forced to a 10 years exile after having written a critical letter to the Portuguese dictator. On January 1, 1971, he lost the right to participate in a conclave, having already reached age 80.

Despite originally being a sympathizer for the right of secession, she fought bravely on both sides. She followed her husband, William Blalock, and joined the CSA's 26th North Carolina Regiment, disguising herself as a young man and calling herself Samuel Blalock. The couple eventually escaped by crossing Confederate lines and joining the Union partisans in the mountains of western North Carolina. During the last years of the war, she was a pro-Union marauder raiding the Appalachia region. Today she is one of the most remembered female combatants of the Civil War. Early life and marriage Sarah Pritchard was born March 10, 1839, in Caldwell County, North CarolinaEggleston, Larry G. (2003).

(now part of Avery County) which is located in the steep region of Grandfather Mountain.Evidence her gravestone in North Carolina listing both dates Sarah Pritchard was the daughter of John and Elizabeth Pritchard, and the sixth of nine children. Points of interest from Malinda's life in North Carolina. When she was a child, Sarah Pritchard resided in Watauga County (also now Avery County) which was her main residence until her death. There, she attended a single-room schoolhouse. She became a close friend of William McKesson Blalock, nicknamed \\"Keith\\" after a contemporary boxer, due to his skill at boxing. Despite their families having been rivals for many years, she married William in 1861, aged 19. Civil War After the Civil War began, the western North Carolina communities in the Appalachian Mountains were divided over their political adherences. Neighbors and families argued with each other. Originally Malinda expressed her sympathy for the right of secession, but Keith and his stepfather Austin Coffey were ardent unionists, although Keith was opposed to President Lincoln, and they had planned to desert toward the Union someday. The Blalocks' opposing views did not affect their marriage. When the Confederate 26th North Carolina Infantry, commanded by Colonel Zebulon Vance, showed up in the region to recruit, Keith began to plan an escape across the frontier from his local political enemies. He was hesitant about whether to flee directly toward Kentucky or enroll temporarily with the Confederate Army to desert across the enemy lines later. Keith also considered the consequences of an untimely escape on Malinda, fearful that local distaste of his actions would cause her to be scapegoated in his absence. Spurred by the good pay in serving the \\"Greys\\", Keith trusted that he would receive a light military commission, possibly to northern Virginia for example, from where it would be easy to desert to the nearest \\"Yankee\\" regiment. He accompanied his neighbors to the recruitment office, signing up with the Confederate infantry. =Samuel Blalock= Fearing for Malinda, Keith had made sure that all local secessionists would see him leaving with the Confederates. However, when arriving at the enlistment gathering at the town's railroad depot, someone began to walk by his side, a mysterious recruit who was wearing a forage cap and had a particularly little physique and delicate features. Surprisingly, \\"He\\" turned out to be Malinda, his own wife. Malinda was officially registered on March 20 of 1862 at Lenoir, North Carolina, as \\"Samuel 'Sammy' Blalock\\", Keith's 20-year-old brother. This document and her discharge papers survive as one of the few existing records of a female soldier from North Carolina, from the many ones who may have actually served. =Confederate military life= Their plan to defect proved unworkable because, already before their arrival, the 26th had fought its biggest battle, which was the loss to the Union of the town of New Bern in eastern North Carolina. Instead of moving to Virginia's battlefront, they remained stationed far from the northern frontier at Kinston, North Carolina, on the Neuse River. While maintaining her hidden identity, Malinda was a good soldier. One of their assistant surgeons, named Underwood, pointed out that \\"her disguise was never penetrated. She drilled and did the duties of a soldier as any other member of the Company, and was very adept at learning the manual and drill.\\" Later Keith became a respected brevet sergeant, ordering Malinda then to \\"stay close to him\\". They fought in three battles together, but \\"Samuel\\"'s true identity remained still unknown. =The desertion= In April 1862, Keith's squad received the order to range the Neuse River's region by fording it during the night, to detect any enemy guarding-posts. Their ultimate objective was to track down the location of a particular Union regiment commanded by US General Ambrose Burnside. At one point of the mission, a hard skirmish began. Most of Keith's squad retreated to safety, crossing back over the Neuse River. However, after regrouping, it was found that \\"Samuel\\" was missing. Keith promptly returned to the battlefield. He found Malinda clinging to a pine and bleeding profusely, with a bullet lodged in her left shoulder. As quickly as he could, Keith carried Malinda back to the 26th. He brought her to the infirmary tent where she was attended by its surgeon, Dr. Thomas J. Boykin. The bullet was successfully removed, but the truth about \\"Samuel\\" was discovered during the medical examination. After obtaining a promise from Boykin that he would spare them some time before reporting, Keith went to a nearby field of poison ivy. He stripped his clothes and flailed through the underbrush for about half an hour. The next morning, he suffered a persistent fever while his affected skin was inflamed and covered by blisters. Keith told the doctors that he had a serious recurrent illness which was highly contagious, adding the ailment of a hernia also. Fearing an outbreak of smallpox, the doctors discharged Keith expeditiously from the regiment and confined him to his tent. Malinda would remain stranded in the camp because her recent wound didn't yet merit a discharge. She decided to confront Colonel Vance once and for all. She offered herself as a volunteer to aid the sick Sergeant Keith on his return to Watauga. Vance's response was a clear \\"no\\", communicating to \\"Samuel\\" that instead \\"he\\" would be his new personal orderly. At that point Malinda decided to tell Vance the truth. Vance's first reaction was of disbelief while calling the surgeon and commenting to him: \\"Oh Surgeon, have I a case for you!\\" However, the physician corroborated Malinda's statement. Immediately, Vance discharged \\"Samuel\\" and demanded the restitution of \\"his\\" original enlisting reward of 50 dollars. Marauders Malinda and her husband could return to Watauga then. Once there, though, Keith was soon required by the local Confederate forces, which demanded that he enlist again‚Äîafter noting his healthy status‚Äîand return to the front. Otherwise, he would be judged by the new Confederate laws of military draft. Therefore, Malinda and Keith fled again, toward Grandfather Mountain. There, they found more local deserters in the same condition. They stayed with them until the Confederate Army intercepted the group, injuring Keith in his arm. Malinda and Keith moved then to Tennessee, where they joined the US-10th Michigan Cavalry of Colonel George Washington Kirk, who was later succeeded by General George Stoneman. For some time, Keith accomplished some administrative chores as a recruitment agent. However, the couple decided to enter in action again, this time for the Union, by joining Colonel Kirk's voluntary guerrilla squadrons, the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry, on scouting and raiding missions throughout the Appalachia region of North Carolina. With Malinda next to him, Keith began in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, as one of the leaders of the guides for the Watauga Underground Railroad. This was a way of escape from the Confederate jail at Salisbury, North Carolina, which was the largest facility of the state. Keith had to guide the escaped Union soldiers to safety in Tennessee. However, from 1863 on, the skirmishes against the patrolling enemy forces in the region were increasingly tougher. Keith's pro-union guerrilla forces began to raid Watauga County. Because once they had been harshly humbled by the southern loyalists, the outlaws pitilessly raided their farms, stole and killed. Marauding throughout North Carolina's Appalachia region, they were soon feared by the entire state. In 1863 Malinda realised she was pregnant, so she travelled to Tennessee to stay with another of the marauders wives. Giving birth to a son on 8 April, 1864, she spent some time with relatives in the area before leaving her young son with them and returning to military activities. Confederate vigilantes then murdered Keith's stepfather, Austin Coffey, and one of Austin's four brothers (William), while the other two survived the attack. The Coffeys had been betrayed by some local folks who were found and killed by Keith after the war. During the war, some of the most ill-fated actions of Malinda and Keith were their two pillaging incursions to the Moore family's farm in Caldwell County, late in 1863. One of Moore's sons, James Daniel, was the 26th's officer who recruited them originally. In the first incursion, Malinda was injured in her shoulder. During the second one, Moore's son was at home, recovering after the Battle of Gettysburg, while Keith got a shot in his eye and lost it. During the war, Keith lost the use of a hand. He also murdered one of his uncles who had turned to the Confederacy. Later life After the war, Malinda and Keith returned to Watauga, to live the rest of their lives as farmers, with their four children. For some time, they had troubles getting Keith's government pension. Afterward, they joined the Republican Party where, in 1870, Keith ran unsuccessfully for a place in the Congress of the United States. Sarah Malinda Pritchard Blalock died in 1901, at age 59, due to natural causes while she was sleeping. She was buried in the Montezuma Cemetery of Avery County. Very affected, Keith moved to Hickory, North Carolina, taking his son Columbus with him. On April 11, 1913, Keith died in a railroad accident. He lost control of his handcar on a curve, and was crushed to death. Some versions attribute his death to a local payback for his past years with Malinda. He was buried beside her at Montezuma Cemetery.

Formation of CAP Scientific CAP Scientific was formed in 1979 by four colleagues who had previously worked in Scicon, a BP subsidiary. Seeking to start a specialist software company for defence applications in the United Kingdom, they approached CAP-CPP, a commercial software house, to back a start-up operation. By 1985, CAP Scientific had established significant work in several areas. It had a strong naval business based on supporting the Admiralty Research Establishment. This Maritime Technology business applied the technologies fostered in research contracts on major development programmes. CAP worked with Vosper Thornycroft Controls to develop machinery control and surveillance systems for the Royal Navy's new generation ships and submarines. An associated Naval Command Systems business had built a strong Action Information Organisation design team, working with both surface and submarine fleets, and a Land Air Systems business also took research and development contracts and was prime contractor for the British Army's Brigade and Battlegroup Trainer (BBGT). The non-defence scientific sector was addressed by setting a Scientific Systems business with expertise in energy generation and conservation. In that year, CAP Scientific established the Centre for Operational Research and Defence Analysis (CORDA) as an independent unit to provide impartial assistance for investment appraisal. At that time military computer systems were purpose-built by major contractors, and CAP Scientific's strategy was to form joint ventures with companies which had market access but could not afford the investment to move into the new technology of microprocessors and distributed systems. The Falklands breakthrough, and DCG In its early years, CAP Scientific took time to establish itself, but in 1982 there came a breakthrough. While the UK was mustering its naval taskforce for the Falklands War, it became clear that for some purposes the Royal Navy needed more computational power. An Urgent Operational Requirement was raised to provide improved fire control solutions for RN Sub-Harpoon. Working in frantic haste, CAP's engineers were able to add an experimental Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 installation into a Royal Navy submarine before she sailed to the South Atlantic. This was one of the first examples of commercial off-the-shelf equipment being employed for military use. The success of this experimental deployment led to the development of a standard RN submarine fit, DCG, which allowed extra processing power to be added to submarine command systems.Some of the above is supported by the following: Friedman, Norman, The Naval Institute guide to world naval weapons systems, 1997-1998, p149 SMCS and Gresham-CAP By its prompt response to the needs of the Falklands War, CAP Scientific demonstrated its ability to supply naval computer technology. With the decision to build the new to carry the Trident missile system, the UK Ministry of Defence proceeded for the first time to run an open competition for the command system. In 1983, CAP Scientific teamed with Gresham-Lion, a British manufacturer of torpedo launch control equipment and now part of Ultra Electronics plc, to form a special purpose company, Gresham-CAP Ltd, to bid for the system. Up to that point all RN ships and submarines had command systems built by Ferranti using custom-built electronics. Gresham-CAP offered a novel distributed processing system based on commercial off-the-shelf components and utilising a modular software architecture largely written in the Ada programming language. The Gresham-CAP consortium won the bid, and their solution, known as Submarine Command System (SMCS) became the basis for subsequent products from the company. The choice of Intel 80386 processors and MultiBus, when many competing chips were available and the PC had only recently reached the market, showed foresight as the basic architecture remains in service today on RN submarines. (The choice of an array of INMOS Transputer chips to process sonar tracking data was less successful - whilst they did the job, the lack of long term support / future product line meant they have been phased out once general purpose processors were able to fulfill the role.) The impact of this still-young company displacing one of the great names of British electronics in the Royal Navy shocked the industry and can be seen as one of the first open competitions in modern British defence procurement and followed a long post-war period of 'preferred contractor' policies. The founders of CAP Scientific sold their complete shareholding to CAP-CPP, which subsequently listed on the London Stock Exchange as CAP Group plc. In June 1986, the Group acquired YARD (Yarrow-Admiralty Research Department) Ltd, a marine engineering consultancy, formerly part of Yarrow Shipbuilders, based in Glasgow. DNA (SSCS) and Merger The Falklands War prompted a further competition in British naval equipment supply when an analysis of the loss of showed that improvements were necessary in surface ship combat systems. A contract for the command system for the navy's new Type 23 frigates was cancelled and put out to competition, and after a long campaign was awarded to the CAP and Gresham consortium, teamed with Racal Electronics. The consortium developed the architecture of SMCS to create a derivative distributed system known internally as Surface- Ship Command System (SSCS). By now Gresham-Lion was under Dowty ownership and CAP Group had merged with the French company SEMA-METRA SA to form Sema Group plc. The Type 23 command system proved to be a step too far for Sema Scientific, as it was now called. The enormous fixed-price contract overran, causing problems for both Sema and Dowty. Dowty was taken over by TI Group, who sold their interests in Dowty-Sema back to Sema Group for ¬£1. Sema Group invited British Aerospace in as a co-investor in the business, and the activities which once formed CAP Scientific, Gresham-CAP and YARD, together with some BAe interests were merged in 1991 into a new entity, BAeSEMA. Ultimately, BAe purchased Sema Group's interest in BAeSEMA. Ironically, with the BAe/Marconi Electronic Systems merger to form BAE Systems in 1999, the CAP Scientific business found itself under the same parent as its erstwhile competitor Ferranti.

History The main street A. Giovanola The local inhabitants probably became subject to Roman rule by the time of the emperor Augustus. Sarcophagi from the 2nd‚Äì3rd century CE have been found and conserved in the \\"Palazzo della Ragione\\". The first documented mention of Cannobio dates to 909. During medieval times, the town became a center for wool and tanning industries, as well as the lumber trade. Cannobio was named as a village by 1207, and was granted administrative autonomy. The Palazzo della Ragione was constructed by 1291 under the government of the podest√† Ugolino da Mandello. Cannobio was assigned to the archdiocese of Milan and from 1817 was under the authority of the bishop of Novara. Its \\"pieve\\" comprised the areas of Cannobina, Cannero, Brissago and several areas on the eastern side of the lake. The church of St. Vittore, already present in 1076, and with a bell tower from the 13th century, was completely rebuilt between 1733 and 1749. Autonomous rule for the community of Cannobio and its valley came about in 1342, with the spontaneous submission to Luchino and Giovanni Visconti, lords of Milan. From then on, its administration remained closely connected to that of the Duchy of Milan. In 1522 a painting of the Virgin Mary allegedly started bleeding. Shortly after this apparition, a plague swept through the area devastating lakeside and valley towns and villages, but leaving Cannobio relatively unscathed. Religious minds linked these two events and Cardinal Charles Borromeo ordered a chapel to be built to hold the painting which is still there today. The economy went through a renewal in the 15th and 16th centuries. The built-up area spread from the original nucleus (the village) down towards the lake. Large residences were built including the Omacini and Pironi palaces. During the Risorgimento the town repelled an Austrian attack from the lake (27-28 May 1859) and was visited by Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1862. The opening of the lakeside road to the Swiss border in 1863 created favorable conditions for the arrival of factories, including silk mills. In 1927 the territory of the comune of Cannobio was extended to incorporate some small villages in the vicinity (Traffiume, Sant‚ÄôAgata, San Bartolomeo). During the Second World War the people of Cannobio rose up against the Nazi and fascist regime, from 2 to 9 September 1944, and proclaimed the Republic of the Ossola. Since the end of the war the community has undergone further changes. From 1995 the town has come within the Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola. Main sights Cannobio lakefront The large lakefront piazza named after King Victor Emmanuel III was given a major refurbishment when in the winter of 2003‚Äì04 it was completely relaid in cobblestones and granite slabs. Also added was of a set of wide flagstone steps down to the lake, where people may sit and watch the lake steamers come and go from the landing stages nearby, and the sailing boats and wind-surfers skimming across the lake. Some of the buildings both on the lakefront and further back in the old part of town date back over 600 years, from when Cannobio was a renowned smuggling town, and most of these have been restored in fine style. From one, Giuseppe Garibaldi addressed the people of Cannobio in 1859, and on another stands a plaque celebrating an important event in Cannobio in 1627. Each building is painted a different colour, creating a traditional Italian port scene. To one side of the Piazza is Cannobio‚Äôs old harbour, which houses the sailing, rowing and speedboats belonging to the locals. The Santuario della Piet√† church commemorates the events of 1522, when a painting of the Virgin Mary was believed to have bled. With its open dome it stands by the lakeside. The painting itself is now housed in another church in the town, and though it is not removed itself, a \\"Sacra Costa\\", representing the painting, is processed through the streets on 7 January every year. Cannobio has its own \\"Lido\\" at the north end of town with a large sandy beach. The beach has a European Union Blue Flag for its cleanliness and facilities.

The name was also applied to a fashionable style of woman's coat worn in the early 19th century. Military uniform The style of uniform incorporating the pelisse originated with the hussar mercenaries of Hungary in the 17th Century. As this type of light cavalry unit became popular in Western Europe, so too did their dress. In the 19th century pelisses were in use throughout most armies in Europe, and even some in North and South America. Uniform of French Second Empire Hussar with the characteristic loose-hanging pelisse over-jacket In appearance the pelisse was characteristically a very short and extremely tight fitting (when worn) jacket, the cuffs and collar of which were trimmed with fur. The jacket was further decorated with patterns sewn in bullion lace, often in a pattern matching that of the dolman worn beneath it. The front of the jacket was distinctive and typically featured several rows of parallel froggings and loops, and either three or five vertical lines of buttons. For officers of the British Hussars this frogging, regimentally differentiated, was generally of gold or silver bullion lace, to match either gold (gilt) or silver buttons. Other ranks had either yellow lace with brass buttons or white lace with 'white-metal' (nickel) buttons. Lacing varied from unit to unit and country to country. It was held in place by a lanyard. In cold weather the pelisse could be worn over the dolman. The prevalence of this style began to wane towards the end of the 19th Century, but it was still in use by some cavalry regiments in the Imperial German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies up until World War I. In the Prussian Army the pelisse had been abolished in 1853 but between 1865 and 1913 it was reintroduced for ceremonial wear by nine hussar regiments and the Life-Guard Hussar Regiment, usually at the request of the regimental Colonel-in-Chief. The two hussar regiments of the Spanish Army retained pelisses until 1931. The Danish Garderhusarregimentet are the only modern military unit to retain this distinctive item of dress, as part of their mounted full-dress uniform.Rinaldo D. D'Ami, page 85 \\"World Uniforms in Colour. Volume 1 - The European Nations\\", S B N 85059 031 1 Ladies fashion In early 19th-century Europe, when military clothing was often used as inspiration for fashionable ladies' garments, the term was applied to a woman's long, fitted coat with set-in sleeves and the then-fashionable Empire waist. Although initially these Regency-era pelisses copied the Hussars' fur and braid, they soon lost these initial associations, and in fact were often made entirely of silk and without fur at all. They did, however, tend to retain traces of their military inspiration with frog fastenings and braid trim. Pelisses lost even this superficial resemblance to their origins as skirts and sleeves widened in the 1830s, and the increasingly enormous crinolines of the 1840s and '50s caused fashionable women to turn to loose mantles, cloaks, and shawls instead.

Birth and early life Portrait of Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay about 1844 (age 22) Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay was born in Belfast, Ireland, the youngest of 6 children. He was distantly related to the Courtenay family who held the title Earls of Devon and were seated at Powderham Castle in Exeter, and was a distant cousin to the novelist Maria Edgeworth, but his own family was not well-to-do. His oldest brother inherited the family property and his other siblings had all come to America to seek a better life. Courtenay came to the United States in 1842, first staying with his brother William in Vicksburg, Mississippi, before settling down in St. Louis, Missouri. He and his brother were brokers, shipping supplies down the Mississippi River to plantation owners, and buying their cotton for shipment to England. Thomas also established himself as an insurance agent, selling fire, marine, and life insurance from an office at the corner of Main and Olive streets in St. Louis. In January, 1860, Courtenay was appointed sheriff of St. Louis county to fill out the term of Sheriff Cere, who had died in office. The office dealt mainly with civil matters such as foreclosures and sheriff's sales. Courtenay did not run for election to a full term as sheriff and was out of office by the end of August. When he left office, there was a significant shortfall in the books of the sheriff's office. Courtenay blamed the problem on his chief deputy, but the matter was Courtenay's responsibility, and the unresolved debt put a damper on his business efforts. When the Civil War broke out, he moved his family to relatives in Harford County, Maryland and established a new insurance office in Baltimore. The Civil War Thomas Courtenay in the uniform of a Confederate Army Captain. In 1863 Courtenay returned to St. Louis to pursue a lawsuit against his former deputy for recovery of the funds missing from the sheriff's office. It became clear that the suit was hopeless and that he would be held financially responsible. Moreover, the Union authorities were suspicious that Courtenay was a rebel sympathizer, due to his business dealings in the South. In fact, Courtenay was a Confederate sympathizer, and had written to Confederate Secretary of War Leroy Pope Walker in May, 1861, offering to act as a purchasing agent for Confederate supplies in the Trans-Mississippi Department. With no prospect of recovering his business in St. Louis and his family well cared for in Maryland, Courtenay turned to the Confederacy. He obtained a volunteer appointment to General Sterling Price's staff, although exactly what he was doing is unknown. In August 1863, Courtenay approached Price with a plan to attack Union shipping by means of an explosive device disguised as a lump of coal, the coal torpedo. The coal bombs would be planted in the coal piles used to fuel Union steamships and locomotives by a team of operatives working behind enemy lines. When a coal bomb was shovelled into the firebox, it would explode, resulting the explosion of the pressurized steam boiler and the destruction of the vessel. Courtenay was sent to Richmond, Virginia carrying military dispatches, and he remained in Richmond to implement his plan. He first wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis on November 30, 1863, explaining his scheme. Davis approved and forwarded Courtenay's letter to Secretary of War James A. Seddon, who arranged for the castings to be made by the army artillery shop in January, 1864. Courtenay was motivated by a Confederate Bounty Law that offered a reward of up to 50% of the value of Union shipping destroyed by means of new inventions. However, the Confederacy had not established a legal framework that would allow private citizens to conduct attacks that were essentially military in nature. A secret bill authorizing the formation of independent secret service corps was passed by the Confederate Congress on February 15, 1864. Courtenay was given a captain's commission in the Confederate Army and permission to form a Secret Service Corps of up to 25 men. The Corps was authorized to attack any Union military vessel or transport carrying military goods found in Confederate waters, but was forbidden to attack civilian shipping or Union shipping in Northern waters. Courtenay would not draw a regular Army salary, but would receive up to 50% of the value of ships and cargo destroyed or captured, payable in Confederate war bonds. Courtenay planned to purchase a coal barge and seed it with coal torpedoes, as a means of getting his bombs into the ships of the Union blockading fleet, but the plan either failed, or was never carried out. Unfortunately for Courtenay, Confederate correspondence giving details of the plan was captured and Courtenay and his associates became wanted men. Union Admiral of the Mississippi David D. Porter ordered, \\"I have given orders to commanders of vessels not to be very particular about the treatment of any of these deperadoes if caught--only summary punishment will be effective.\\" Captain Courtenay obtained permission from President Davis to leave the country and go to the UK to raise money for the Confederacy. Courtenay kept in contact with his corps, and directed their actions from abroad. The coal torpedo was credited with sinking the Greyhound, a private steamboat that had been commandeered by General Butler for use as a floating headquarters on the James River, on November 27, 1864. Courtenay also took credit for the destruction of the gunboat USS Chenango as she sailed from New York Navy Yard on April 15, 1864. After the war While in England, Courtenay attempted to sell his coal torpedo to a number of foreign governments, including England, France, Spain, and Turkey, all without success. He returned to the United States in 1868, but he was in poor health for the rest of his life, and died at the age of 53 at Jordan's Sulphur Springs near Winchester, Virginia, on September 3, 1875. He is buried in Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland. Marriage and children Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay married Mildred Ann Clendenin on August 25, 1847 in Louisville, Kentucky. Mildred's father, James Clendenin, was a merchant in Louisville, who had met Courtenay on a trip to St. Louis. Mildred's mother was from the Peay family of Virginia. Mildred's Uncle Austin Peay had married Peachy Speed, sister of Joshua Fry Speed and James Speed. Since Mildred's father had sold his home and was in the middle of moving to St. Louis, Thomas and Mildred were married at Farmington, the Speed family plantation in Louisville, Kentucky. Thomas and Mildred had five children: *Austin Matlack Courtenay (1850‚Äì1938) *James Clendenin Courtenay (1852‚Äì1853) *Charles Edgeworth Courtenay (1854‚Äì1854) *Ellen Watters Courtenay (1856‚Äì1938) *Mary Amelia Isabel Courtenay (1867‚Äì1943) Mildred, Austin and Ellen went to England with Thomas in 1864 and returned in 1867. When Mary was born in 1867, Mildred was living with relatives in Maryland, while Thomas remained in England trying to sell his invention. References *Perry, Milton F.

Built for the Michigan Central Railroad, it replaced the original depot in downtown Detroit, which was shuttered after a major fire on December 26, 1913, forcing the still unfinished station into early service. Formally dedicated on January 4, 1914, the station remained open for business until the cessation of Amtrak service on January 6, 1988. Comprising a train depot and an office tower with thirteen stories, two mezzanine levels, and a roof height of 230 feet (70 m). The Beaux-Arts style architecture was designed by architects who had previously worked together on Grand Central Terminal in New York, and it was the tallest rail station in the world at the time of its construction. The building is located in the Corktown district of Detroit near the Ambassador Bridge, approximately southwest of downtown Detroit. It is located behind Roosevelt Park, and the Roosevelt Warehouse is adjacent to the east, with a tunnel connection to the MCS. The city's Roosevelt Park serves as a grand entryway to the station. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Since 2011, demolition works, minor structural repairs, repairs of the roof structure, and covering the glass roof openings in the concourse have been performed. The basement, which was once full of water, has been fully drained. Barbed wire fencing has been installed in an attempt to keep out vandals and the windows in the tower have been replaced. Restoration projects and plans had gone as far as the negotiation process, but none had come to fruition until May 2018 when Ford Motor Company purchased the building for redevelopment into a mixed use facility and cornerstone of the company's new Corktown campus. Images of the building prior to the Ford purchase remain a premier example of ruins photography. History =As an active station= The building began operating as Detroit's main passenger depot in 1913 after the older Michigan Central Station burned on December 26, 1913. It was owned and operated by Michigan Central Railroad and was planned as part of a large project that included the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel below the Detroit River for freight and passengers. The old station was located on a spur line, which was inconvenient for the high volume of passengers it served. The new Michigan Central placed passenger service on the main line. Postcard of the Michigan Central Station (c.1914) The growing trend toward increased automobile use was not a large concern in 1912, as is evident in the design of the building. Most passengers would arrive at and leave from Michigan Central Station by interurban service or streetcar, due to the station's distance from downtown Detroit. The station was placed away from downtown in order to stimulate related development to come in its direction. An ambitious project to connect the station to the Cultural Center via a wide boulevard was never realized. Nonetheless, the station remained active for several decades. The trains of the New York Central Railroad, the company which acquired the Michigan Central Railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Canadian Pacific Railroad operated from the station. At the beginning of World War I, the peak of rail travel in the United States, more than 200 trains left the station each day and lines would stretch from the boarding gates to the main entrance. In the 1940s, more than 4,000 passengers a day used the station and more than 3,000 people worked in its office tower. Among notable passengers arriving at MCS were Presidents Herbert Hoover, Harry S. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt, actor Charlie Chaplin, inventor Thomas Edison and artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. The other major station of Detroit was the Fort Street Union Depot. In the 1920s Henry Ford began to buy land near the station and made construction plans, but the Great Depression and other circumstances squelched this and many other development efforts. The original design included no large parking facility. When the interurban service was discontinued less than two decades after MCS opened, the station was effectively isolated from the large majority of the population who drove cars and needed parking to use the facility. =Named trains= Major trains and destinations included: *Baltimore & Ohio **Ambassador to New York City (Jersey City CNJ terminal) via Pittsburgh, PA and Washington, D.C. **Shenandoah, route as above **Cincinnatian, to Cincinnati via Dayton **Great Lakes Limited, to Louisville via Dayton and Cincinnati *New York Central **Detroiter, to New York City **Empire State Express, to New York City **Mercury, Chicago to the west, Cleveland to the east **Northerner, to Mackinaw City, Michigan via Bay City, Michigan **Timberliner, to Mackinaw City, Michigan via Bay City, Michigan **Twilight Limited, to Chicago **Wolverine, Chicago to New York City via Southwestern Ontario =Decline and abandonment= Passenger volume did not decrease immediately. During World War II, the station was used heavily by military troops. After the war, with a growth in automobile ownership, people used trains less frequently for vacation or other travel. Service was reduced and passenger traffic became so low that the New York Central attempted to sell the facility in 1956 for , one-third of its original 1913 building cost. Another attempted sale in 1963 failed for lack of buyers. In 1967, maintenance costs were seen as too high relative to the decreasing passenger volume. The restaurant, arcade shops, and main entrance were closed, along with much of the main waiting room. This left only two ticket windows to serve passengers and visitors, who used the same parking-lot entrance as railroad employees working in the building. Michigan Central Station 1988 Amtrak assumed operation of the nation's passenger rail service in 1971, reopening the main waiting room and entrance in 1975. It started a $1.25 million renovation project in 1978. Six years later, the building was sold for a transportation center project that never materialized. On January 6, 1988, the last Amtrak train pulled away from the station after owners decided to close the facility. Amtrak service continued at a platform on Rose Street near the former station building until the new Detroit station opened several miles away in New Center in 1994. In July 1992, the Detroit Master Plan of Policies for the southwest sector's urban design identified the station as an attractive or interesting feature to be recognized, enhanced and promoted. =Moroun ownership= Controlled Terminals Inc. acquired the station in 1996. Its sister company, the Detroit International Bridge Co., owns the nearby Ambassador Bridge and both are part of a group of transportation-related companies owned by businessman Manuel Moroun, Chairman and CEO of CenTra Inc. The company demolished the train shed in 2000, and converted the remaining tracks and platforms into an intermodal freight facility, named \\"Expressway\\" and operated by Canadian Pacific Railway. This facility was closed in June 2004. MCRR Terminal track diagram (1914) In 2004, Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick announced that the city was pursuing options to relocate its Detroit Police Department headquarters and possibly consolidate other law enforcement offices to MCS. However, in mid-2005, the city canceled the plan and chose to renovate its existing headquarters. In 2006 it was proposed that the station be redeveloped into a Trade Processing Center adapting the station as a customs and international trade processing center due to its proximity to the Ambassador Bridge. Although the City of Detroit considered the building a \\"Priority Cultural Site\\" in 2006, the City Council on April 7, 2009, passed a resolution to demolish the structure. Seven days later, Detroit resident Stanley Christmas sued the city of Detroit to stop the demolition effort, citing the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. In 2008, the station owners said that their goal was to renovate the decaying building. The estimated cost of renovations was $80 million, but the owners viewed finding the right use as a greater problem than financing. Moroun proposed making the station into a convention center and casino Such a project would have cost $1.2 billion, including $300 million to restore the station. Dan Stamper, president of Detroit International Bridge, noted that the station should have been used as one of the city's casinos. In 2010, State Senator Cameron S. Brown and Mickey Bashfield, a government relations official for the building owner CenTra Inc., suggested that the station could become the Detroit headquarters of the Michigan State Police, include some United States Department of Homeland Security offices, and serve as a center for trade inspections. The development never came to fruition. Before window re- installation (2010) On March 25, 2011, in an effort to push forward a potential sale and redevelopment, Dan Stamper, spokesperson for Ambassador Bridge owner Manuel \\"Matty\\" Moroun, announced plans to work with the City of Detroit on funding replacement of the tower's roof, and installing new windows on the structure. Stamper told the Detroit News: \\"It would be much easier to help a developer to come up with a package to use the depot if some improvements were made.\\" In June 2011, work began on partial asbestos abatement on the first floor; other work conducted included interior demolition work, removal of broken glass from first floor windows, and removal of water. In June 2012, electricity was restored to the interior. Lights have illuminated the main lobby nightly. On May 5, 2011, the Detroit International Bridge Company announced it engaged the Ann Arbor firm of Quinn Evans on behalf of the Moroun family that owns the building to oversee restoration of the roof and windows of the structure. Bridge Company owner Moroun stated, \\"We hope this is just the beginning of a renaissance for the depot.\\" The once flooded basement was largely drained, with about 4 inches of water at its highest still remaining in a sub-basement of the building. On June 10, 2014, it was reported that the owners of Michigan Central Station were moving forward with about $676,000 in rehab work, and had received permits to install a new 9,000-pound capacity freight elevator, which will allow for the smooth installation of new windows and roof work. In late 2014 work to install the elevator started, with an expected completion by February. In February 2015, the owners announced that they would replace more than 1,000 windows above the first level. In late April the city announced a land swap deal with the Bridge Company to transfer a 3-acre strip of Riverside Park near the Ambassador Bridge for 4.8 acres of adjacent property owned by the Bridge Company. As part of that agreement, the city would receive up to $5 million for park improvements, and the Bridge Company agreed to replace the windows in the train station. In July the Detroit City Council approved the land transfer. As of December 2015, all of the new windows have been installed. As of August 2016, the Moroun family had spent 10 years and $12 million on electricity, windows and the elevator shaft, to revitalize the building. Matthew Moroun said he might put part of his family's operations in the 18-story Corktown building. In September 2017 the \\"Detroit Homecoming\\" event was held in the station, the first legal event to occur there since the building's closure in 1988. =Ford ownership= On March 20, 2018, The Detroit News published an article noting the Ford Motor Company was in talks to buy the structure. On May 22, 2018, ownership of the building was transferred from the Moroun-owned MCS Crown Land Development Co. LLC to New Investment Properties I LLC. Ford's representatives neither confirmed nor denied if this ownership exchange was made by them. The Moroun family confirmed on June 11, 2018, that Ford was the new owner of the building. Ford purchased the station along with the Roosevelt Warehouse. Ford plans to turn the building into a hub for its autonomous vehicle development and deployment, and it will be the anchor for the company's Corktown campus. The building will hold both Ford offices and offices of suppliers and partner companies. The first floor concourse will reopen to the public with restaurants and retail. Housing will also be created on the top floors. Restoration and renovations are expected to be completed by 2022. On June 19, 2018, Ford held a community celebration, in which local rapper Big Sean performed, and the building was opened to the public for the first time since its closure in the 1980s. According to local Detroit media outlets, Ford plans to renovate the station, the warehouse next door, and complete construction on the rest of its campus within four years, and is part of the company's $1 billion capital improvements project, which also includes the creation of a development on the West side of Dearborn, Michigan, as well as a renovation of the company's main headquarters in Dearborn. As part of that $1 billion, Ford Land is actively seeking at least $250 million in tax and other incentives, and has claimed that the project would not be financially feasible without the support of incentives. CEO of Ford Land, Dave Dubensky, stated during an interview with the Detroit Free Press that Ford plans to retain four of the passenger tracks at MCS in the event that Amtrak returns from the station in New Center as well as for potential commuter rail. Previous Amtrak routes that utilized MCS included the Wolverine, Lake Cities, Twilight Limited, and Niagara Rainbow. There have been other rail related projects in the area around the station in recent years. In 2010, The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded $244 million in grants for high-speed rail upgrades between Chicago and Detroit. A consortium of investors, including the Canadian Pacific Railway, has proposed a new, larger rail tunnel capable of handling large double-stacked freight cars under the Detroit River. In December 2018 Ford began Phase I of the building restoration. The work involved drying out the building and reinforcement of structural columns and archways. Phase II began in May 2019 and consisted of masonry restoration of the tower and concourse, retiling of the ceiling of the waiting room, and repair of the structural steel. Architecture Floor plan The building is of the Beaux-Arts Classical style of architecture, designed by the Warren & Wetmore and Reed and Stem firms who also designed New York City's Grand Central Terminal. Michigan Central was designed at the same time, and is seen as a spiritual twin to Grand Central in New York, as both were meant as flagship stations on Vanderbilt's rail lines, both were designed to have office towers in their original design concepts (though Grand Central's tower was never built), both have the same detailing, and were opened six months apart. The price tag for this building was $15 million when it was built. Roosevelt Park creates a grand entryway for the station, which was fully realized around 1920. Waiting Room, 2009 The building is composed of two distinct parts: the train station and the 18-story office tower. The roof height is . The original plan for the tower included a hotel, offices for the rail company, or a combination of both. The tower was used only for office space by the Michigan Central Railroad and subsequent owners of the building. The tower was never completely used; the top floors were never completely furnished, and served no function. The main waiting room on the main floor was modeled after an ancient Roman bathhouse, with walls of marble and vaulted ceilings. The building also housed a large hall adorned with Doric columns that housed the ticket office and arcade shops. Beyond the arcade was the concourse, which had brick walls and a large copper skylight. From here, passengers would walk down a ramp to a tunnel from which the platforms could be accessed by stairs and elevators. Under the shed there were ten passenger platforms consisting of one side platform and five island platforms along ten paired tracks. In addition, one track served the Railway Express Agency (REA) mail service at the southern end of the shed. Immediately outside the shed were seven additional freight tracks. Below the tracks and building was a large area for baggage and mail handling and offices. After the purchase of the building by Ford in 2018, several individuals came forward looking to return property and architectural features that were stripped and stolen from the station after its closing in 1988. The biggest item of note being the main station clock. The building renovation for Ford is being designed by Quinn Evans Architects of Detroit. In popular culture The station has been featured in several films. In September 2002, extensive closeups and fly-by shots were featured in the movie Naqoyqatsi. The 2005 film Four Brothers opens with the main character driving his car along the front of Michigan Central Station toward Michigan Avenue. In January 2005, it was used as a location set for the movie The Island (directed by Michael Bay). MCS was used for scenes in the movie Transformers (also directed by Michael Bay) in October 2006. The building has been used in some of rapper Eminem's work, including the title sequence of the movie 8 Mile and his music video for the song \\"Beautiful\\", during the beginning of which the building features prominently. A scene from the ABC crime drama Detroit 1-8-7 was shot and set inside the station, and it often appeared in the background in other episodes. The building's lobby was significant in the closing scenes of the 2012 documentary Detropia. It was also used in a climactic fight scene in the 2016 movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Its exterior was used in the Arrow episode titled \\"Doppelganger\\". It is also featured in the video game Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition and the novel Influx by Daniel Suarez. It is also shown in the 2016 movie \\"Abattoir\\" as the exterior for a jail that houses the criminally insane.

Its boundaries are East 38th Street to the north, Chicago Avenue to the west, East 42nd Street to the south and Cedar Avenue to the east. The neighborhood provides convenient access to downtown via Interstate 35W, the Hiawatha Corridor, and the airport and Bloomington area via Cedar Avenue. For residents who like recreation, Bancroft lies just blocks north of Lake Nokomis, the Hiawatha Golf Course and the scenic Minnehaha Creek. Bancroft is a small but vibrant residential community consisting mostly of single-family dwellings built before 1940 that are owner-occupied. The neighborhood does have some commercial property along Bloomington Avenue and along 38th Street. The Bancroft neighborhood is home to two schools- Bancroft Elementary School, a continuous progressive school, and the newly opened El Colegio/ CreArte center for the arts.  History  The urban history of the Bancroft Neighborhood dates back to the early 1910s through the 1930s. More than 80% of the structures were built before 1940 and are today primarily owner-occupied. The neighborhood was named for Bancroft Elementary School, one of the oldest education buildings in the Minneapolis School District. In the 1920s, Bancroft residents would hop on the Bloomington or Cedar Avenue street cars to go downtown or to work. Many neighbors would get visits from the Milkman, the Watkins Spice man, and the Fuller Brush man. Other shopping and business could be done right in the neighborhood. You could find a butcher, grocer, drug store, doctor's office and a nursery all within a few blocks. Organ grinders with monkeys would provide entertainment for local children along local streets. Children in the 1920s, same as children today, tore out of their homes to catch the ice cream man. In the winter and summer fun could be found at nearby Powderhorn Lake, Lakes Nokomis and Hiawatha. In 1986, the city moved the northern boundary of the neighborhood from 36th Street to 38th Street, transferring 24 city blocks from Bancroft to the Powderhorn Park neighborhood. The significant population decline between 1980 and 1990 can mostly be attributed to this boundary change.

Built in 1396‚Äì1495, it was once located on the border of a large hunting park belonging to the Visconti family of Milan, of which today only scattered parts remain. It is one of the largest monasteries in Italy. Certosa is the Italian name for a house of the cloistered monastic order of Carthusians founded by St. Bruno in 1044 at Grande Chartreuse. Though the Carthusians in their early centuries were known for their seclusion and asceticism and the plainness of their architecture, the Certosa is renowned for the exuberance of its architecture, in both the Gothic and Renaissance styles, and for its collection of artworks which are particularly representative of the region. History Gian Galeazzo Visconti, hereditary lord and first Duke of Milan, commissioned the building of the Certosa to the architect Marco Solari, inaugurating the works and laying the foundation stone on August 27, 1396, as recorded by a bas-relief on the facade. The location was strategically chosen midway between Milan and Pavia, the second city of the Duchy, where the Duke held his court. The interior of the church. The church, the last edifice of the complex to be built, was to be the family mausoleum of the Visconti. It was designed as a grand structure with a nave and two aisles, a type unusual for the Carthusian Order. The nave, in the Gothic style, was completed in 1465. However, since the foundation, the Renaissance had spread in Italy, and the rest of the edifice was built according to the new style, redesigned by Giovanni Solari, continued by his son Guiniforte Solari, and including some new cloisters. Solari was followed as director of the works by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, (1481‚Äì1499). The church was consecrated on May 3, 1497. The lower part of the fa√ßade was not completed until 1507. The construction contract obliged the monks to use part of the revenue of the lands held in benefice to the monastery to continue to improve the edifice. Consequently, the Certosa includes a huge collection of artworks of all centuries from the 15th to the 18th. In 1782, the Carthusians were expelled by the Emperor Joseph II of Austria, and were succeeded at the Certosa by the Cistercians in 1784 and then by the Carmelites in 1789. In 1810 the monastery was closed until the Carthusians reacquired it in 1843. In 1866 it was declared a National Monument and sequestrated by the Italian State, although some Benedictines resided there until 1880. The monks currently living in the monastery are Cistercians admitted to it in the 1960s. In August 1946 the illegally exhumed body of Benito Mussolini was discovered in the complex. Two Franciscan friars were charged with assisting in the concealment of the body. The church View of the fa√ßade. The portal. The path to the church. Side view of the church with cupola. The church is built on a Latin cross plan,The ancient plan was ascribed to Bernardo Veneziano, by A. M. Romanini (L'Architettura viscontea nel 15mo secolo [Storia di Milano vol. 6] Milan, 1955:611‚Äì82), who recovered Bernardo's building activity from scattered traces in documents. with a nave, two aisles and transept, typical of Gothic architecture. The chancel terminates with an apse. It is covered by crossed vaults on Gothic arches and is inspired, on a reduced scale, by the Duomo of Milan. The vaults are alternatively decorated with geometrical shapes and starry skies. The transept and the main chapel end with square-plan chapels with smaller, semi-circular apses on three sides. The fa√ßade of the church is famous for its exuberant decorations, typical of Lombard architecture, every part being decorated with reliefs, inlaid marble and statues. Sculptors who worked on it include Cristoforo Mantegazza and Giovanni Antonio Amadeo himself. In addition to applied sculpture, the facade itself has a rich sculptural quality because of the contrast between richly textured surfaces, projecting buttresses, horizontal courses and arched openings, some of which are shadowed, while those in the small belfries are open to the sky. The sober form of the roughly finished brick front can be seen in a fresco by Ambrogio Bergognone in the apse of the right transept, painted in 1492‚Äì1495,For these dates, see Giampiero Borlini, \\"The Fa√ßade of the Certosa in Pavia\\" The Art Bulletin 45.4 (December 1963:323‚Äì336) p. 325ff; several paintings by Bergognone and a relief by Briosco show the facade in active stages of erection. when work was commencing on the new facade, portraying Gian Galeazzo Visconti offering the model of the Certosa to the Blessed Virgin. Its profile, with roofs on three levels, has been compared to the churches of San Giovanni in Monza and San Petronio in Bologna; among the architects in close correspondence at all three projects, Borlini ascribes the form of the original facade at the Certosa to Giacomo da Campione, who was working at Pavia while his uncle Matteo was completing San Giovanni in Monza.Borlini 1963:324. The architect Giovanni Solari, in building the double row of arcades down the flanks of the church, modified its appearance. After his death he was succeeded in Pavia by his son Guiniforte Solari, but work came to a halt with the death of Guiniforte in 1478.Borlini 1963:325. In 1492 Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono took up the construction, assisted on site, for he was concurrently occupied with the cathedrals at Pavia and at Milan and other churches, by his inseparable collaborator on both cathedrals, Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. In their hands the project was thoroughly redesigned.An annotation by the abbot Valerio, ca 1634‚Äì45, records Il disegno della facciata fu fatta da Jacomo Antonio Dolcebono e Ambrogio Fossano (noted by Borlini 1963:325f.) Scores of artists were involved. The classicist style portal is by Benedetto Briosco (1501). The porch has a large arch of classicist form resting on paired Corinthian columns which are each surmounted by a very strongly modelled cornice on which the arch rests, the construction being derived from the Classical, used by Brunelleschi, and employed here for a bold and striking effect. The decoration is of bas-reliefs illustrating the History of the Certosa. Above the central arch is a shallow balcony of three arches, above which rises the central window. This campaign was interrupted in 1519 as work was going forward by the condition of French occupation in Lombardy after the War of the League of Cambrai. French troops were encamped round the Certosa. Notations of work on the facade did not resume until 1554, when a revised design under the direction of Cristoforo Lombardo was approved for the completion of the facade above the second arcade; there marble intarsia was substituted for the rich sculptural decorations of the lower area. Some final details were added by Galeazzo Alessi.Borlini 1963:332‚Äì33. The Small and Grand Cloisters The Grand Cloister An elegant portal, with sculptures by the Mantegazza brothers and Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, leads from the church to the Small Cloister (in Italian: Chiostro Piccolo.) This has a small garden in the center. The most striking feature is the terracotta decoration of the small pilasters, executed by Rinaldo de Stauris between 1463 and 1478. Some arcades are decorated by frescoes by Daniele Crespi, now partially ruined. Also noteworthy is the late-14th century lavabo in stone and terracotta, with scenes of the Jesus with the Woman of Samaria at the Well. Similar decorations also characterize the Grand Cloister (Italian: Chiostro Grande), which measures c.125x100 meters. The elegant cells of the monks open to the central garden. The arcades have columns with precious decorations in terracotta, with tondoes portraying saints, prophets and angels, alternatively in white and pink Verona marble. There were once also paintings by Vincenzo Foppa, now disappeared.  Paintings  Panel of St. Ambrose by Ambrogio Bergognone In the main apse of the church is a fresco by Bergognone celebrating the Incoronation of Mary between Francesco and Ludovico Sforza. Other frescoes with saints and prophets were executed by Lombard artists, including a young Bernardino Zenale. The Certosa has painted masterpieces by Bergognone including the panels of St. Ambrose (1490), and San Siro (1491) and, most significantly, the Crucifixion (1490). Other works by Bergognone are now found in other museums of Europe. Other paintings in the church include a Holy Father, panels by Giovanni Battista Crespi, Il Morazzone, Guercino, Francesco Cairo and Daniele Crespi, and a remnant of a polyptych by Perugino.Three panels of this forming a triptych are in the National Gallery, London: Pietro Perugino, including the Certosa Altarpiece Originally depicting the Madonna and Saints, it is now disassembled and scattered among museums: the only portion in the Certosa is God the Father with cherubim. An Annunciation has disappeared; three panels, the Virgin Adoring the Infant Christ, St. Michael and St. Raphael with Tobias are on display at the National Gallery of London, in the United Kingdom. In the southern transept is the tomb of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, begun in 1494‚Äì1497 by Giovanni Cristoforo Romano and Benedetto Briosco, but completed only in 1562. The northern transept houses the tomb of Ludovico Sforza, 7th Duke of Milan, and his wife Beatrice d'Este. The sculptures on the tomb were carried here in 1564 from the Milanese church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the statues generally being considered the masterwork of Cristoforo Solari. In the Cappella di San Michele (St Michael's Chapel) are frescoes by Carlo Francesco Nuvolone.Francesco Frangi. \\"Nuvolone.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

For many years it was one of the three men's hockey conferences that operated under the umbrella of the Eastern College Athletic Conference; the others were the ECAC East (now the New England Hockey Conference), and the ECAC West (soon to be the United Collegiate Hockey Conference). Member institutions were located in the New England region of the United States, in the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Unlike the ECAC East and ECAC West, there was no women's division of the ECAC Northeast. Most ECAC Northeast schools did not sponsor women's ice hockey; the two that did (Nichols & Salve Regina) played in the ECAC East. The ECAC Northeast dissolved in 2016 when The Commonwealth Coast Conference, a Division III all-sports conference and the primary conference of most ECAC Northeast members, decided to sponsor men's ice hockey as a varsity sport.http://cccathletics.com/sports/general/2015-16/Releases/CCCHockey Becker, Johnson and Wales, and Suffolk joined the CCC as associate members for ice hockey, while CCC member University of New England moved their men's team from the ECAC East to play in the CCC league. History The foundation of the ECAC Northeast was laid in 1971 when ECAC 2, the college division of the ECAC created a third conference called ECAC 3. When the NCAA created Division III in 1973 ECAC 3 was placed at that level and remained there for the rest of its existence. In 1985, as a result of the NCAA beginning a Division III Tournament, ECAC 2 was reorganized into two separate conferences, ECAC East and ECAC West, with each becoming D-III leagues. To prevent confusion, ECAC 3 was renamed as ECAC North/South with all members split into North and South divisions (similar to how ECAC 2 had been divided into East and West divisions). This arrangement continued until 1992 when ECAC North/South was rearranged into three divisions (North, South and Central) and renamed ECAC North/South/Central. Over the course of the 1997‚Äì98 season the South Division lost 6 of its 8 teams, mostly to Division I, but rather than return to a two- division arrangement the league rebranded as ECAC Northeast. A year later the four member schools who were from Division II schools began playing in a separate tournament which allowed the other programs to play in an NCAA- sanctioned D-III conference tournament for the first time. As a result, ECAC Northeast got its first automatic bid to the tournament in 2000. In 2009 the nine schools whose primary conference was either MASCAC or Northeast-10 left when those two leagues began sponsoring ice hockey. The remaining teams stayed on for another seven years but in 2016 the Commonwealth Coast Conference, the primary conference for seven of the nine member teams, began sponsoring ice hockey. All nine teams joined CCC as either full or associate members and the ECAC Northeast was dissolved. ECAC Northeast Tournament Upon its founding, ECAC 3 instituted a tournament. Originally only a single game the championship slowly expanded along with the league. Members There were nine member schools as of the conference's final season in 2015-16\\\\. {  |- ! !Location !Athletic nickname !Colors !Founded !Joined !Left !Current Conference‚Ä† |- ! |Amherst, Massachusetts |Lord Jeffs style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 1821 |1972 |1992 |NESCAC |- !

In Jack Kirby's Fourth World setting, the Anti-Life Equation is a formula for total control over the minds of sentient beings, that is sought by Darkseid, who, for this reason, sends his forces to Earth, as he believes part of the equation exists in the subconsciousness of humanity. Various comics have defined the equation in different ways, but a common interpretation is that the equation is a mathematical proof of the futility of living. History Jack Kirby's original comics established the Anti-Life Equation as giving the being who learns it power to dominate the will of all sentient and sapient races. It is called the Anti-Life Equation because \\"if someone possesses absolute control over you - you're not really alive.\\"Forever People #5 Most stories featuring the Equation use this concept. The Forever People's Mother Box found the Anti- Life Equation in Sonny Sumo, but Darkseid, unaware of this, stranded him in ancient Japan. When Metron and Swamp Thing attempt to breach the Source, which drives Swamp Thing temporarily mad, Darkseid discovers that part of the formula is love.Swamp Thing #62 Upon being told by the Dominators of their planned invasion of Earth, Darkseid promises not to interfere on the condition that the planet is not destroyed so his quest for the equation is not thwarted.Invasion! #1 It is later revealed in Martian Manhunter vol.2 #33 that Darkseid first became aware of the equation approximately 300 years ago when he made contact with the people of Mars. Upon learning of the Martian philosophy that free will and spiritual purpose could be defined by a Life Equation, Darkseid postulated that there must exist a negative equivalent. In Walt Simonson's Orion (2001), it is revealed that Darkseid and Desaad have gained the Equation from clones of Billion Dollar Bates. In stopping them Orion learned the Equation, and tried to use it to make people happy and good, but decided that the suppression of free will is always a bad thing. It was later revealed that Mister Miracle knows the formula, but is one of the few with the willpower not to use it. During the series Young Justice, it was stated that the mystical heroine Empress holds within her a piece of an Anti- Life Equation, which allows her to control the minds of others to limited extents. Countdown to Final Crisis #10 reveals that the Pied Piper also contained the equation within his mind and can manifest it through music. Desaad attempts to use Piper as his pawn to help him destroy Brother Eye and Darkseid so that he could rule Apokolips. During the Final Crisis, Darkseid's plan comes to fruition even without Pied Piper's help. In fact, using the \\"spoken form\\" of the Anti-Life, Darkseid (reborn after his death as \\"Boss Dark Side\\" on Earth) is able to rebuild a strong power base on Earth by having Mokkari unleash the Anti-Life Equation through the internet by email, turning those exposed to it into his mindless slaves. Libra used the Anti-Life Equation to turn several members of his Secret Society of Super Villains into Justifiers while some of Earth's superheroines and supervillainesses were converted into new versions of the Female Furies. It was revealed that the Equation can be countered by drawing the New Genesis word for \\"freedom\\" on one's face. Also, Doctor Sivana invented a device that allowed Lex Luthor to wrest control of the Equation-controlled Justifiers from Libra and Darkseid. In Terror Titans #4, it is revealed that because of the brain's status as an electromagnetic organ, Static is immune to the Equation's effects. In Final Crisis #7, Wonder Woman breaks the Equation's hold over the people of Earth by binding Darkseid's body with the Lasso of Truth. After Darkseid's disappearance, the Calculator tasks himself with the role of tracking down the fragments of the Equation left in the internet, which had taken the appearance of floating diamonds in Alta Viva, an in-universe multi-player online game similar to Second Life. By having real diamonds cut in the shape of the virtual ones, the Calculator hopes to harness and restore its power for himself.Oracle: The Cure #1-3 The Multiversity features a different version to the Anti-Life Equation known as the Anti-Death Equation: a dark, mysterious power used by the Gentry, capable of transforming and corroding anything from the laws of physics to even beings as powerful as Monitors, turning its victims into gruesome and evil creatures who are incapable of dying. In DCU continuity the Equation itself retains its importance to a great many interested parties having come into the control of a host of users both in incomplete and whole formulations of itself. It is first possessed by the evil Old God Yuga Khan who uses it to resurrect many of his fallen brethren in a final battle against his sons Uxas and Izaya before falling in battle.Infinity Man and The Forever People #5 (2014) Eventually many an individual would come to possess either finite understanding or complete utilization of the Anti- Life Equation for their own personal use over time. Some eons later Darkseid would use a fraction of its nightmarish will-sapping power in his invasion cycles of the Earth 2 parallel universe;Earth 2 #0 soon it was revealed that others possessed the full Equation but lacked the incentive to use it. The formula itself however is revealed to be a sentient being able to express itself to its current hosts.Infinity Man and The Forever People #3 It was revealed that the Anti-Life Equation was the source of the Anti-Matter Universe's creation, and that the Anti-Monitor used to be a Qwardian scientist in the Anti-Matter Universe named Mobius who was the first to find and touch the Anti-Life Equation; it then fused with him and transformed him into the Anti-Monitor, the Anti-Life Equation's living embodiment.Justice League vol. 2 #44 When Darkseid died in the battle against him and his daughter Grail, Mobius forfeited the equation in order to return to his original form. The power itself which possessed him is now in the hands of his original benefactor, establishing her as the Goddess of Anti-Life.Justice League vol. 2 #46 Interpretations of the Equation Over the years, the Anti-Life Equation has changed as various writers have offered their own definitions of the concept. In Jim Starlin's mini-series Cosmic Odyssey, the Anti-Life Equation is revealed as a living shadow-based deity that corrupts and destroys everything it touches. This revelation shocks even Darkseid, who teams up with the New Gods and a group of superheroes from Earth to stop the Anti-Life Equation entity, ultimately sealing it off from their reality. The Anti-Life Equation Entity would be retconned as a creature who had been mislabeled as far as having anything to do with the Anti-Life Equation. In Issue #4 of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, the demon Choronzon mimics the form of 'Anti-Life' when challenging Dream to 'the Oldest Game' - a battle of wits in which the two must define increasingly powerful entities in turn. Attempting to end the game, Chronozon states \\"I am Anti-Life, the beast of judgement. I am the dark at the end of everything. The end of universes, gods, worlds...of everything\\", at which point he takes on the appearance of a large, blank face against a white background. Dream counters this by proclaiming \\"I am hope\\".The Sandman issue #4 The most current incarnation was established in the 2005 Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle mini-series, written by Grant Morrison. In it Darkseid (or Dark Side, as he was calling himself) gained full control of the Anti-Life Equation, which is revealed to be: > loneliness + alienation + fear + despair + self-worth √∑ mockery √∑ > condemnation √∑ misunderstanding √ó guilt √ó shame √ó failure √ó judgment n=y > where y=hope and n=folly, love=lies, life=death, self=dark side By speaking said equation, Darkseid can insert the full formula into people's minds, giving them the mathematical certainty that life, hope and freedom are all pointless. According to Oracle, who barely escaped the \\"full\\" effects of the Equation by shutting down the entire Internet just in time, the Anti-Life Equation further states that the only point in anything is to conform to Darkseid's will.Grant Morrison (w), J.G. Jones, Carlos Pacheco (p), J.G. Jones, Jesus Merino (i). \\"Darkseid Says\\". Final Crisis issue #4 of 7. November 2008. DC Comics. Shilo Norman (the current Mister Miracle) is able to break free from this with the help of Metron, gaining immunity from the Equation in the process. He passes this immunity to his allies by drawing a specific pattern (the pattern is shown to be the New Genesis word for freedom) on their face. When Jim Starlin returned to writing the New Gods in 2007's Death of the New Gods mini-series, the retcon was revised, with the Anti-Life Equation Entity being revealed to be one-half of a cosmic being that was split into two by the war of the old gods (the other half of the cosmic entity being the Source). In a text page published in \\"Final Crisis Secret Files\\", Grant Morrison attempts to reconcile the Starlin version of the Anti-Life Equation with his own version, by suggesting that the Equation is indeed sentient (as Starlin suggests) and that even after \\"mastering\\" the Equation, Darkseid still does not understand the true horrific nature of what the Anti-Life Equation is and its relationship with the Source.Final Crisis Secret Files (w)Grant Morrison In the New 52 the Anti-Life has much of the same powers it had as well as interesting newer ones, for starters aside from its ability to give one complete control over a person's thoughts and actions, right down to the motor functions of a living being.Infinity Man and The Forever People #6 It can also resuscitate the dead reviving them as soulless automatons slaved to the users will, Yuga Khan having used it to bring back the dead Old Gods to aid him in battle against his sons, Dreamer Beautiful using it for the first time to resurrect a deceased Mark Moonrider, and Darkseid himself using a fraction of it to draw unsuspecting victims to their end by broadcasting it over his parademon hive factories. Life Equation The Anti-Life's opposite member takes more prominence within the New 52, The white Light of Life is said to be the spark that originally gave birth to the positive matter universe of Earth-Zero just as the Anti-Life gave rise to the antimatter universe. Unlike the Anti-Life Equation which saps a person of their free will, The Life Equation is an all consuming power which has the capability to restructure reality by changing its formula around rewriting the very multiverse itself, representing the attributes of life itself pertaining to change and variance. The make up of the equation formula seems to vary from iteration to iteration. One instance relates it to the Emotional Spectrum and its corresponding seven lights. > rage, greed, fear, will, hope, compassion and love Initially believing all of these refraction's of the source light to lead in becoming the Life Equation, it is then realized that the formula itself is a separate power all its own connected directly to The Source of all things. Its power once hidden behind the wall of its namesake had been removed and supplanted within the White Ring utilized by Kyle Rayner to escape it after the seven emotional entities gave themselves to both him and it in order to replenish the Emotional Reservoir. It is later revealed that Kyle managed to escape with the equation in hand after he reached out into the source itself and unknowingly claimed the equation.\\"Green Lantern Annual\\" Vol 5 #2 Once claimed the Life Equation has the power or redefine reality on a universal to multiversal degree enabling the user to change the formula in order to remake all of existence. In another manifest, the formula reads as a direct contradiction to that of the Anti-Life Equation presenting as follows. > companionship + understanding + assurance + joy + altruism √∑ respect √∑ > commendation √∑ sympathy x innocence x dignity x success x acceptance y=n > where y=despair and n=caution, love=truth, death=rebirth, and self=light > side For reality embodies life and the equation is the tangible abstract of how it is defined, also similarly to Anti-Life; the Life variant can subjugate life to follow the user in the creation of a new world order in favor of protection of life, rather than accepting it as meaninglessness. The Life Equation was split into seven parts and placed into Kyle's and six newly created White Power rings. These seven rings can be brought together to restore the Life Equation if needed but until that time the White Lantern Corps can protect the equation.Green Lantern: New Guardians (vol. 1) #40 (May 2015) Alternate realities * In the Elseworlds graphic novel Superman: The Dark Side (1998) Darkseid raises Kal-El as his own (evil) son and later finds that Krypton had been in possession of the Anti-Life Equation before it was destroyed and Jor- El had sent it with his son so that he could use it to subjugate Earth and create a new Krypton. Naturally Darkseid finds it and builds a series of towers which broadcast \\"...the ANTI-LIFE EQUATION which obliterates free will and individual identity\\". * In the World's Funnest Elseworlds one-shot (2001), created by Evan Dorkin and a variety of artists, a conflict between Bat-Mite and Mister Mxyzptlk inadvertently destroys the DCU (including many pre-crisis worlds). When they destroy Apokolips the sole survivor is Darkseid who is left floating in space with a piece of paper with the equation drawn on it; The paper has a diagram to the effect of \\"Mister Mxyzptlk + Bat-Mite = Anti-life\\". This causes Darkseid to die laughing. * In the DCeased written by Tom Taylor, Darkseid has captured Cyborg, who possesses one half of the Anti-Life Equation. With the other half already in his possession, Darkseid attempts to mix the two halves together, but DeSaad warns him that if Cyborg dies, the Equation will cease to exist. Darkseid thus summons the Black Racer to control Cyborg's life and activates the Equation. However, Black Racer's connection tampers the Anti-Life Equation and makes it autonomous. This causes Darkseid to lose control to the now tainted Equation, and in his despair he destroys Apokolips. DeSaad manages to teleport Cyborg away beforehand, but as soon as Cyborg appears on Earth, the Equation breaches the Global Internet and infects the world via mobile devices connected to it. In other media =DC animated universe= * In Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"Apokolips... Now!, Part 1\\", Orion arrives to Earth and uses his Mother Box, to explain to Superman about Apokolips, and its ruler, Darkseid. During its explanation, Mother Box spoke of how Darkseid was after the Anti-Life Equation, which was said to give him great power. * In the Justice League episode \\"Twilight\\", Darkseid hacks into the systems of Brainiac, with potentially catastrophic results. As he explains to the captured Superman, this will give him the solution to the Anti-Life Equation, allowing him to destroy the universe and rebuild it - this time in his own image. * In Justice League Unlimited's final episode, \\"Destroyer\\", during an assault on Earth by Darkseid and the armies of Apokolips, Lex Luthor is taken into The Source by Metron. Just as Darkseid ensnares Superman in a powerful, agony-inducing net, Lex Luthor returns from The Source and reveals the Anti-Life Equation, shown as a glowing, swirling light in the palm of his hand, to Darkseid. Darkseid places a hand over the glow, Lex places a hand on Darkseid's hand, both agreeing the equation \\"is beautiful\\", and they both disappear. It is not known what happened to either Lex Luthor or Darkseid. Superman believes that they both died, but both Batman and Green Lantern doubt it, believing instead that they will both be back. According to Dwayne McDuffie, upon learning the Anti-Life Equation, both Lex Luthor and Darkseid became part of the Source Wall. = Smallville = * The Anti-Life Equation is briefly featured in the Smallville season 8 episode \\"Legion\\". During the episode, Brainiac attempts to capture the knowledge of others through a computer virus; the voice echoing through the computer states \\"Hate plus fear plus loneliness...\\". * During season 9 episode \\"Roulette\\", the Anti-Life Equation was briefly referenced by Clark Kent. * The Anti-Life Equation's Omega symbol appears in the tenth and final season of Smallville. It serves as a sign when a being is influenced by Darkseid. Notable people are Orion, Slade Wilson in the episode \\"Patriot\\", and Oliver Queen in \\"Masquerade\\", and then reversed in \\"Finale, part 2\\". =Other= * In Teen Titans Go!, Darkseid mentions the Anti-Life Equation, but he is criticized as being a \\"math nerd\\" by Beast Boy. * In the DC Super Hero Girls episode \\"My So Called Anti-Life\\", Darkseid, posing as a human math teacher named Dr. Seid, tricks the Super Hero Girls into solving the Anti-Life Equation for him by putting it on a test. With the completed equation, Darkseid begins transforming Earth's population into duplicates of himself. Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Bumblebee, and Raven manage to reverse the effects by reminding the people of who they really are, which they refer to as \\"introducing new variables to the equation to change the answer\\". * In the video game Injustice 2, the Anti-Life Equation is mentioned in pre-battle dialogue between Darkseid and Wonder Woman. Darkseid asks what primitive weapon she is wielding and she claims to be the Anti-Life Equation. Darkseid states that she has revealed her true form, implying Wonder Woman has been corrupted by the Anti-Life Equation. * In Lego DC Super-Villains, Darkseid is after the Anti-Life Equation. He sends the Crime Syndicate to replace the Justice League in order to find the Equation on Earth. Towards the end of the game, the Rookie would then absorb the equation and use it to change Darkseid and his army. * During the Justice League Action episode \\"It'll Take a Miracle\\", Mr. Miracle is revealed to be in possession of a piece to Darkseid's Anti-Life Equation machine. Darkseid's plan was to erase all sentient thought in the universe with the device and enslave everyone. However Batman was able to destroy the machine when he replaced the missing component with one of Miracle's light show props. * In the third season of the DC animated series Young Justice, the phrase \\"Prepare The Anti Life Equation\\" can be spelt out from the first letter of each episode title. In the episode \\"Influence\\", an experimental Anti-Life equation is used by Granny Goodness against Superman, Wonder Woman, and Hawkwoman, as well as the Female Furies they are fighting. Superman later manages to stop Granny Goodness from using the equation on them. In \\"Unknown Factors\\", after an encounter with Halo (who contains the spirit of a Mother Box), Goodness theorizes that she can access the Anti-Life Equation, and contacts Darkseid after the encounter to let him know she has found it. In \\"Antisocial Pathologies\\", Halo is taken by Granny into the X-Pit, a space that is the access point to what is called the ghost dimension, allowing her to decipher the equation into being. Granny then tests it on Helga Jace, who retains her emotions but loses her free will, and thus follows Granny's orders. Thus, Granny confirms the revelation that the ghost dimension and Halo's powers are a form of the equation: ghost dimension + Halo = Anti-Life. Despite interference from the Light via Geo-Force and Terra, Granny is able to escape with Halo. In \\"Terminus\\", after a majority of the Justice League and the Team attempt to raid Granny's space station base, she succeeds in using the equation to enslave them all before spreading the equation's influence throughout the universe to place it under Apokolips rule; beginning the Age of Darkseid. In \\"Into the Breach\\", she would have succeeded, had Victor Stone not come to her base when he did and allowed for the heroes to stop her by freeing Halo. By the season finale, Darkseid's quest to find the Anti-Life Equation supposedly continues elsewhere in the universe, while Vandal Savage and the Light keep an eye on Halo for their future plans. * In the Supergirl episode \\"The Bottle Episode\\", one of Brainiac 5's doppelgangers uses the Anti-Life Equation to murder another version of himself.

If the string is attached to a stick the rotation can be maintained by whipping the side of the body. The string may also be wound around the point while the trompo is spinning in order to control its position or even lift the spinning top to another surface. Etymology These toys are popular in Latin America where the name trompo emerged, but there are many different local names. In Spain, these toys may be called trompo or peonza, perinola, and pirinola. In the Philippines, they are called trumpo or turumpo, while in Portugal they are called pi√£o. In India it is called Bugari (Kannada); children make these tops by nailing wood and spin them with twisted jute rope. In Japan, similar tops are known as koma, with most cities having a particular design. In Germany a Peitschenkreisel may also be called Doppisch, Dildop, Pindopp, Dilledopp, Triesel or Tanzknopf (roughly dancing top) In Morocco it is called Trombia, and it is often made out of wood and painted in a reddish brown color. In Dutch it is called \\"priktol\\" (see https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priktol). A \\"tol\\" is a top. An other type of top is the \\"zweeptol\\". A \\"zweep\\"is a whip. (see https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderspelen and find \\"zweep\\" on that page)  History  There is historical evidence suggesting the existence of trompos as early as 4000 BCE, and trompos have been found on the bank of the Euphrates river, likely belonging to an ancient civilization. There is also evidence that members of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations used trompos as well.  Description of motion  The gyroscopic effect allows the trompo to spin over its point until the force of gravity ends up at an angle with respect to the top's axis of rotation, causing a variation in the location of the center of gravity as the trompo undergoes precession (where the axis of rotation of the trompo moves in a circular path). The fall of the top is directly proportional to the angle between the direction of gravity on the trompo and the top's axis of rotation. The fall is also directly proportional to the magnitude of the force of gravity and is inversely proportional to the trompo's angular velocity. As air resistance and friction with the ground begin to slow the trompo's spin, its center of gravity begins to destabilize and the top's bottom point begins to trace a circular path with the ground. Soon the trompo becomes fully unbalanced and it falls to the ground, rolling until it comes to rest. This general motion is largely shared among many trompo variants, but differences in several design parameters (such as the mass distribution, friction between the bottom point and the ground, and the spinning method) can still lead to significant variation in the aforementioned variables. Form The trompo's form has varied enormously throughout history. Though trompos have traditionally been cone-shaped, there are also diverse variations in trompo form across regions. However, despite these regional differences in design, all trompos are constructed to be capable of employing the gyroscopic effect. Trompos generally have an approximately pear- shaped body and are usually made of a hard wood such as hawthorn, oak or beech, although new resins and strong plastic materials have also been used. Clay trompos have also been found from ancient civilizations near the Euphrates river. Whipping tops often have a more cylindrical shape to provide a bigger surface to be struck by the whip. A trompo has a button-shaped on top, usually bigger than the tip on which it spins, and it is generally made of the same material as the rest of the body. The base of a trompo is a stud or spike which may have a groove or roller-bearing to facilitate lifting the spinning trompo with a whip or string without imposing much friction on the body. The trompo surface may be painted or decorated, and some versions incorporate synthetic sound devices. The small size diameter and low mass of most trompos means that mechanical whistles would cause excessive drag (physics) and reduce their spinning time. The Philippine trumpo differs in the tip, which is straight and pointed. It usually looks like a nail embedded in a wooden spheroid. Play Winding the trompo Basic throw Playing with a trompo consists of throwing the top and having it spin on the floor. Due to its shape, a trompo spins on its axis and swirls around its conic tip which is usually made of iron or steel. A trompo uses a string wrapped around it to get the necessary spin needed. The player must roll the cord around the trompo from the metallic tip up. The user must then tie the string in a knot on the button-shaped tip before releasing it. When rolling the cord around the trompo, the cord must be tightly attached to it. The technique for throwing a trompo varies. One end of the cord must be rolled around the player's fingers and with the same hand the trompo must be held with the metallic tip facing upwards. Championships are held in different Latin American countries, especially in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico where it is very popular among children of the middle and lower classes. In Mexico most trompos sold are made of plastic, with a metal tip, and sometimes they are made of wood. There is a popular game called picotazos, where the main goal is to destroy the opponents' trompo. Another game is where a circle is drawn on the ground and a coin is placed in the middle, and the goal here is to strike the coin. In Puerto Rico, trompos are sometimes played similarly to certain marble games, with trompos being placed in a circle drawn on the ground. The goal of this variant is to knock the trompos out of the circle. Failure to spin or spinning in the circle causes your trompo to be placed in the circle, and another person has a turn to spin. Trompos in Puerto Rico and Chile are frequently modified to have a sharper point. Jos√© Miguel Agrelot, a Puerto Rican comedian, hosted a long-standing television program, Encabulla y Vuelve y Tira, whose name described the action of throwing and spinning a trompo. One of his comedic characterizations, mischievous boy Torito Fuertes, was a one-time sponsor of a line of trompos. The Filipino trumpo is basically played in the same manner, except that a knot is not tied into the tip before throwing it for the spin.

Hitchcock graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1817 (17th out of 19) and was commissioned a third lieutenant of Field Artillery. Career He was promoted to captain in 1824. From 1829 to 1833, he served as commandant of cadets at West Point and was promoted to major in 1838. By 1842 he achieved the rank of the lieutenant colonel in the 3rd Infantry Regiment, in command of Fort Stansbury.Hitchcock, Ethan Allen, Croffut, William Augustus, Fifty years in camp and field: diary of Major- General Ethan Allen Hitchcock, U.S.A., G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1909. He served in the Seminole War in Florida, in the Pacific Northwest, and in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, where he served as Gen. Winfield Scott's inspector general in the march on Mexico City. He received a brevet promotion to colonel for Contreras and Churubusco and to brigadier general for Molino del Rey. In 1851, became the colonel of the 2nd Infantry. From 1851 to 1854, he commanded the Pacific Division and then the Department of the Pacific. In October 1855, he resigned from the Army following a refusal by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis to extend a four-month leave of absence that he had requested for reasons of health. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and began a presumed retirement, occupying himself with writing and studies of general literature and philosophy. Hitchcock was a diarist, and his journal entries from this time have served as a crucial source of evidence for Howard Zinn's reinterpretation of United States history, Voices of A People's History of the United States. =Civil War= After the start of the Civil War, Hitchcock applied to return to the service, but was rejected. It was only after the intervention of Winfield Scott that he was commissioned a major general in February, 1862 and became special adviser to the Secretary of War. From March 17 to July 23, 1862, he served as the chairman of the War Board, the organization that assisted President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton in the management of the War Department and the command of the Union armies during the period in which there was no general-in-chief. (Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan had been relieved of his responsibilities as general-in-chief and Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck had not yet replaced him.) Hitchcock sat on the court-martial of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which convicted the general of disobedience and cowardice. From November 1862 through the end of the war, he served as Commissioner for Prisoner of War Exchange, and then Commissary-General of Prisoners. Hitchcock was mustered out in 1867 and moved to Charleston, South Carolina, then to Sparta, Georgia. Personal life On April 20, 1868, he was married to Martha Rind Nicholls (1833‚Äì1918) in Washington, D.C. Martha was a daughter of Isaac Smith Nicholls and Joanna Maria (n√©e Rind) Nicholls. Hitchcock died on August 5, 1870 at Glen Mary Plantation in Sparta, two years after his marriage. He was buried in West Point National Cemetery, New York. His widow died on August 15, 1918. =Contributions to alchemy studies= By the time of his death, Hitchcock had amassed a large private library, including over 250 volumes on the subject of alchemy. This collection was widely regarded as one of the finest private holdings of rare alchemical works and is preserved by St. Louis Mercantile Library at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Through Remarks upon Alchemy and the Alchemists and other writings, Hitchcock argued that the alchemists were actually religious philosophers writing in symbolism. In Problems of Mysticism and its Symbolism, the Viennese psychologist Herbert Silberer credited Hitchcock with helping to open the way for his explorations of the psychological content of alchemy. A manuscript from the Hitchcock collection =Musical collection= Hitchcock also played the flute and amassed a sizable collection of flute music. In the 1960s, almost one hundred years after his death, part of Hitchcock's personal music collection was discovered in Sparta, Georgia. This collection, which consists of 73 bound volumes and approximately 200 loose manuscripts, currently resides in the Warren D. Allen Music Library at Florida State University. Included in this collection are works by some of the general's contemporaries, music manuscripts handwritten by Hitchcock himself, and items of personal correspondence. The library's acquisition of these materials was celebrated in 1989 by a recital given by F.S.U. flute students and attended by several of Hitchcock's descendants.

His bookDe' secreti del reuerendo donno Alessio Piemontese, prima parte, diuisa in sei libri, In Venetia: per Sigismondo Bordogna, 1555. was published in more than a hundred editions and was still being reprinted in the 1790s. The work was translated into Latin, German, English, Spanish, French, and Polish. The work unleashed a torrent of 'books of secrets' that continued to be published down through the eighteenth century.W. Eamon, Science and the Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994). Piemontese was the prototypical 'professor of secrets'. His description of his hunt for secrets in the preface to the Secreti helped to give rise to a legend of the wandering empiric who dedicated his life to the search for natural and technological secrets. The book contributed to the emergence of the concept of science as a hunt for the secrets of nature, which pervaded experimental science during the period of the Scientific Revolution.W. Eamon, \\"Science as a Hunt\\", Physis 31 (1994), 393-432.

Origins of Methodist episcopacy Francis Asbury's ordination as bishop by Thomas Coke at the 1784 Christmas Conference John Wesley consecrated Thomas Coke a \\"General Superintendent\\" and directed that Francis Asbury also be consecrated for the United States in 1784, where the Methodist Episcopal Church first became a separate denomination apart from the Church of England. Coke soon returned to England, but Asbury was the primary builder of the new church. At first he did not call himself bishop, but eventually submitted to the usage by the denomination. Notable bishops in Methodist history include Coke, Asbury, Richard Whatcoat, Philip William Otterbein, Martin Boehm, Jacob Albright, John Seybert, Matthew Simpson, John S. Stamm, William Ragsdale Cannon, Marjorie Matthews (the first female Methodist bishop), Leontine T. Kelly, William B. Oden, William Willimon, R.S. Williams (the first Methodist (CME)bishop elected from Louisiana) and Thomas Bickerton. Duties =African Methodist Episcopal Church= In the African Methodist Episcopal Church, \\"Bishops are the Chief Officers of the Connectional Organization. They are elected for life by a majority vote of the General Conference which meets every four years.\\" =Free Methodist Church= The Book of Discipline of the Free Methodist Church states that \\"Bishops are the overseers of the church. They lead the church to fulfill its mission which requires them to be holy examples with skill and experience to provide oversight. They must understand the nature and purpose of our church. They must also be able to communicate clearly the gospel, the church's mission and the vision of the Free Methodist Church; possess a well cultivated understanding of other cultures; and identify, develop, and lead godly, competent leaders.\\" =United Methodist Church= In the United Methodist Church, a resident bishop is appointed to a specific episcopal area (i.e., the bishop resident in the area; unless a bishop happens to be retired and simply residing in the area, not assigned to it). A resident bishop is the Presiding Bishop of any and all annual (i.e., regional) conferences of the church within the area. Such bishops are said to have residential as well as presidential duties within his/her area. In the UMC, bishops serve as administrative and pastoral superintendents of the church. They are elected for life from among the ordained elders (presbyters) by vote of the delegates in regional (called jurisdictional) conferences, and are consecrated by the other bishops present at the conference through the laying on of hands. (Central conferences may choose to elect their bishop for a term shorter than life; in many cases the practice is election for a term of four years.) In The United Methodist Church bishops are not ordained in the traditional sense (i.e. belonging to the threefold ministry of bishop, presbyter, deacon) but remain members of the \\"Order of Elders\\" while being consecrated to the \\"Office of the Episcopacy.\\" Within The United Methodist Church only bishops are empowered to consecrate bishops and ordain clergy. Among their most critical duties is the ordination and appointment of clergy to serve local churches as pastor, presiding at sessions of the annual, jurisdictional, and general conferences, providing pastoral ministry for the clergy under their charge, and safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the church. Furthermore, individual bishops, or the Council of Bishops as a whole, often serve a prophetic role, making statements on important social issues and setting forth a vision for the denomination, though they have no legislative authority of their own. In all of these areas, bishops of United Methodist Church function very much in the historic meaning of the term. According to the Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church, a bishop's responsibilities are Annual conference In each annual conference, United Methodist bishops serve for four year terms, and may serve up to three terms before either retirement or appointment to a new annual conference. Council of Bishops The collegial expression of episcopal leadership in the United Methodist Church is known is the Council of Bishops. The Council of Bishops speaks to the church and through the church into the world and gives leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships.The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: Council of Bishops ‚Äî ¬∂ 526 (retrieved 27 May 2007). The Conference of Methodist Bishops includes the United Methodist Council of Bishops plus bishops from affiliated autonomous Methodist or United churches.

He was the leader of the first US expedition to the Pacific Northwest. He is known for his role in the 1789 Nootka Crisis, having been present at Nootka Sound when the Spanish naval officer Jos√© Esteban Mart√≠nez seized several British ships belonging to a commercial enterprise owned by a partnership of companies under John Meares and Richard Cadman Etches. This incident nearly led to war between Britain and Spain and became the subject of lengthy investigations and diplomatic inquiries. Kendrick was the first American to try to open trade with Japan. He began the Hawaiian sandalwood trade. He was killed during an exchange of cannon salutes with the ship Jackal when one of the cannons was loaded, purportedly by accident. John Kendrick was instrumental in pioneering trade in the Pacific Northwest, the Hawaiian Islands, and China, as well as helping the young United States establish itself as global trade power.Ridley (2010), pp. 368‚Äì369  Early life  Kendrick was born in 1740 in what was then part of the Town of Harwich, Massachusetts (now Orleans, Massachusetts), on Cape Cod. He was the third of seven children of Solomon Kendrick (or Kenwick) and Elizabeth Atkins. His family name was originally spelled \\"Kenwrick\\", later \\"Kenwick\\" and \\"Kendrick\\". John Kendrick came from a long family line of seamen. Solomon Kenrick, his father, was master of a whaling vessel. John began going to sea with his father by the time he was 14 years old. By his late teens he was sailing with crews out of Potonumecut (today part of Orleans). The Potonumecut area was home to remnant native tribes such as the Wampanoag. Kendrick's friendly relations with these natives later helped him forge friendships and alliances with native peoples in the Pacific Northwest, excepting the Haida chief Koyah.Ridley (2000), pp. 4, 89 At the age of 20 he joined a whaling crew, working on a schooner owned by Captain Bangs. In 1762, near the end of the French and Indian War, John Kendrick served under his cousin Jabez Snow, on a militia mission in the frontier of Western New York. Like most Cape Codders of the time, he served for only eight months and did not re-enlist. During the 1760s John's father, Solomon, moved to Barrington, Nova Scotia. John stayed in Massachusetts, in Cape Cod and Boston, where an atmosphere of defiance and dissent was quickly growing during the early years of the American Revolution. There was widespread opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of the late 1760s. John may have been involved in the boycotts of British goods, riots over British impressment of American sailors, and other rebellious acts such as unrest around the Boston Custom House which led to the 1770 Boston Massacre. In late 1767 John Kendrick married Huldah Pease, who came from a seafaring family of Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard. American Revolution Kendrick was reputed to have participated in the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. He was an ardent Patriot. During the American Revolutionary War he commanded the privateer Fanny (also known as the Boston), an eighteen-gun sloop of the Continental Navy with a crew of 104, which Kendrick converted into a brigantine. He was commissioned May 26, 1777. The Fanny disrupted British shipping and captured a few vessels, which won Kendrick a degree of fame and wealth. In August, 1777, the Fanny and another privateer, General Mercer, captured two West Indiaman ships full of valuable cargo, the Hanover Planter and the Clarendon, after a battle with two 28-gun frigates. The captured ships were taken to Nantes in mid-August, 1777, causing an international stir. France had not yet joined the war and the prizes tested France's neutrality. The incident helped expedite France's decision to join the war against Britain. Kendrick returned home in the fall of 1778 a hero. With the prize money he had received from Louis XVI of France Kendrick bought a house, wharf, and store in Wareham, Massachusetts, and built the first public school there. He lived there with his family through the winter. In early 1779 he sailed to war again in command of the privateer Count d‚ÄôEstang, which he owned in partnership with Isaac Sears. In April, southwest of the Azores, he was captured by the 28-gun British frigate Brutus and its 10-gun tender. The British captain impressed most of Kendrick's crew, eventually releasing Kendrick and the remaining 30 men in a boat. They travelled to the Azores and then Lisbon. In June, 1779, Kendrick and his remaining crew traveled to France, and then returned to America with the French fleet. Shortly after returning to America Kendrick sailed for the Caribbean in command of the Marianne, where he captured at least one more rich prize. He returned home once again shortly before the British surrender at Yorktown in October of 1781. By this time he had fathered six children during his sporadic visits home. When the war ended in 1783, Kendrick returned to whaling and coastal shipping until he became commander of the first American ships of discovery. The Columbia Expedition Not much is known about what happened to John Kendrick between the Revolution's end and his voyage to the Pacific Northwest. A syndicate led by Boston merchant Joseph Barrell financed the Columbia Expedition in 1787. The vessels included were the ship and the sloop . Columbia heeling as she approaches a squall. Drawing by George Davidson in 1793, who served as the ship's artist. The command of the larger Columbia was given to Captain Kendrick, then 47 years old, and 32-year-old one-eyed Robert Gray was given Washington. Overall command of expedition was given to Kendrick. The combined crews of the two ships numbered about 40 men, most hailing from Cape Cod, Boston, Rhode Island, and the North Shore of Massachusetts. Many were veterans of the Revolutionary War.Ridley (2000), pp. 20‚Äì21 The first officer of the Columbia was Simeon Woodruff, the oldest man on the voyage. Woodruff had sailed with James Cook aboard on his famous third voyage around the world. As such, Woodruff had already been to the Pacific Northwest, Hawaii, and China.Ridley (2000), pp. 20‚Äì21 The second officer of Columbia was 25-year-old Joseph Ingraham, a veteran of the Massachusetts State Navy and POW during the Revolution. Later, Ingraham became captain of the , which sailed in 1790 to compete in the fur trade. Unlike Gray and Haswell, Ingraham was an admirer and supporter of Kendrick. Ingraham kept a journal of the voyage, but it has been lost. He wrote a separate journal describing Nootka Sound in 1789, which has survived. The third officer of the Columbia was 19-year-old Robert Haswell, who kept an account of the voyage that came to serve as the main chronicle of the first two years. He also kept a journal during Gray's second voyage without Kendrick. Ridley (2000), pp. 20‚Äì21 The first officer of the Lady Washington was Robert Davis Collidge. Kendrick also brought two of his sons: Eighteen year old John Kendrick, Jr, as fifth officer of the Columbia, and sixteen year old Solomon Kendrick, as a common seaman.Ridley (2000), pp. 20‚Äì21 =Outward voyage 1787‚Äì1788= The Columbia Expedition set sail from Boston Harbor on the morning of October 1, 1787, after a brief party with family and friends. The vessels reached the Cape Verde Islands on November 9, where Simeon Woodruff, after a dispute with Kendrick, left Columbia and went onto the islands with all his baggage. Kendrick was unhappy with the way Columbia handled, and felt that the hold had not been well packed, which Woodruff had been responsible for. When Kendrick ordered the hold broken up and repacked, Woodruff refused to help and after continued bickering Kendrick removed Woodruff from his position as first officer, after which Woodruff opted to leave the expedition entirely.Ridley (2000), pp. 30‚Äì31 A Spanish captain passing by the islands offered to take Woodruff to Madeira. He eventually returned to America and lived in Connecticut most of the remainder of his life. This incident deepened Haswell's dislike of Kendrick, as Haswell had been friendly with Woodruff and held him in high esteem. In his journal Haswell complained bitterly, describing Woodruff as \\"an officer under the Great Captain James Cook on his last Voyage\\". Haswell was mistaken: Woodruff was a gunner's mate under Cook, not an officer.Ridley (2000), p. 31 While at Cape Verde Kendrick unpacked and reorganized the hold of the Columbia, hoping to improve its handling under sail. The hold of Columbia contained most of the expedition's provisions for the next two years, as well as a large assortment of trade goods hoped to be useful for acquiring sea otter pelts on the Pacific Northwest coast. These trade goods included such things as tin mirrors, beads, calico, mouth harps, hunting knives, files, and bar metal that could be worked into chisels or other tools. Despite the reorganization of the hold, Columbia continued to handle poorly.Ridley (2000), pp. 25‚Äì26 Kendrick continued the journey on December 21, 1787, and reached Brett Harbour on Saunders Island in the western Falkland Islands on February 16, 1788. Here they collected water and made final preparations for the voyage around Cape Horn. While sailing to the Falklands tensions between Kendrick and Haswell increased. One day Haswell struck a sailor named Otis Liscomb, who had failed to respond to Haswell's order to come on deck. When Kendrick saw Liscomb's bloody face he became angry and slapped Haswell and had him removed from his cabin to the common quarters. Haswell requested that Kendrick let him leave the expedition and Kendrick agreed, saying he could take the next vessel they encountered. But no other ship appeared. At the Falkland Islands Haswell was transferred from Columbia to Washington to serve under Gray. Haswell's dislike for Kendrick and Gray's ambition to be free from Kendrick's overall command reinforced one another. Ridley (2000), p. 32 Kendrick considered wintering in the Atlantic, but decided to leave the Falklands on February 28, 1788. They sailed south toward Cape Horn. Five days later they passed Isla de los Estados (Staten Island), the eastern extremity of Tierra del Fuego. A storm was approaching from the west. Kendrick continued south, trying to skirt the edge of the storm. Other ships had escaped storms near Cape Horn by sailing farther south, a plan that Kendrick used. He evaded the worst of the storm by sailing to nearly 62¬∞ south latitude, about south of Cape Horn. Through March the ships struggled through cold and heavy weather, dealing with frost, sleet, twenty foot swells, high winds, and icebergs. About a month later William Bligh tried rounding Cape Horn in but was forced back.Ridley (2000), pp. 26‚Äì30 On March 22 the ships were about south-southwest of Cape Horn. They had passed west of the cape and so changed course toward the northwest. But during the night of April 1 the winds shifted, indicating dangerous weather. Kendrick had the Columbia adjust course in an attempt to race ahead. A signal gun was fired and the Washington followed. But in the morning light, with the storm still approaching, the two ships had lost sight of each other. Over three more days of heavy seas and blizzard-like conditions, they were entirely lost to one another. The Columbia, badly damaged, was driven back eastward, while the crew made what repairs they could. For ten days Washington continued on through a series of violent squalls, culminating in a gale that Haswell described as \\"greatly sirpassing [sic] any thing before I had aney [sic] Idea of.\\" Once the storm cleared Gray was pleased to be separated and saw a chance to free himself from Kendrick's command. Kendrick had written orders for Gray in the event they were separated. They would rendezvous at Alejandro Selkirk Island (then known as M√°s Afuera), the westernmost island of the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, west of the coast of Chile. Gray made his way there, arriving on April 22, 1788. He brought the Washington to within a few miles of the island, then waited over night. In the morning Gray scanned the horizon and saw no sign of the Columbia, unsurprisingly since Washington was a faster vessel. Nevertheless, Gray figured he had fulfilled Kendrick's order and was now free to continue on alone.Ridley (2000), pp. 47‚Äì48 Gray was in need of water and wood, but there was no place to land at Alejandro Selkirk Island, so he headed north to Ambrose Island (Isla San Ambrosio), part of the Desventuradas Islands. Arriving on May 3, Gray sent men ashore. Spending the day on the island they did not find water but returned to the ship with a catch of fish, seals, and sea lions. Then Gray continued on, passing far west of the Gal√°pagos Islands by May 24.Ridley (2000), pp. 48‚Äì50 Kendrick reached the rendezvous at M√°s Afuera about a month after Gray had left it. Kendrick had been instructed by Joseph Barrell \\"not to touch at any part of the Spanish dominions...unless driven there by some unavoidable accident\\". With Columbia badly in need of repairs and running out of water and wood, and Kendrick's eagerness for any news of Washington, he decided to risk visiting M√°s a Tierra, today known as Robinson Crusoe Island, where there was a small Spanish settlement.Ridley (2000), pp. 49‚Äì55 Kendrick had the Columbia approach the harbor, stopping about a mile offshore, unsure what sort of treatment he might receive. The Spanish governor of the island, Don Blas Gonzales, recognized a ship in distress. He sent out a fishing boat with a few armed men. The Spanish officer Nicholas Juanes came on board Columbia. He noted the ten cannons but thought the crew friendly and unthreatening. Kendrick said he needed a safe anchorage for making repairs and to take on water and wood. Juanes took first mate Joseph Ingraham back to shore to request permission to enter the harbor. Don Blas Gonzales was intrigued by this American ship, the first he had ever seen, and granted permission. The Columbia moored near the fort. Kendrick came ashore and met Gonzales, who found him affable and respectful. Inspecting the ship, Gonzales agreed with Juanes that the voyagers meant no harm. Although under Spanish law he was to seize foreign ships, mercy was permitted for ships in distress. Gonzales granted Kendrick six days for repairs and provisioning. The crew set to work repairing the damaged mast, sternpost, rudder, and many leaks. They filled water casks from a creek by the fort. After four days the Spanish packet boat Delores arrived with supplies and mail for the settlement. Kendrick wrote a letter to Joseph Barrell, informing him of their situation and separation from the Washington. He entrusted the letter to the captain of the packet boat. After the six days were up Kendrick prepared to leave, but heavy winds from the north forced Columbia to remain at anchor until June 3. Meanwhile the packet boat had reached Valpara√≠so, where news of Columbia resulted in orders to seize the ship. On June 12 a merchant brig, the San Pablo, was armed and sent to capture the Columbia. Shortly after the warship Santa Maria followed. By then Columbia was sailing north far off the coast and the Spanish ships did not find her. After a few days the San Pablo put into Lima with the news, prompting the Viceroy of Peru, Teodoro de Croix, to send another ship in pursuit of Columbia. After the pursuit ships returned without having found the Columbia Don Blas Gonzales was stripped of his office. Gonzales defended his actions in a court case that continued for years. Later, Kendrick enlisted Thomas Jefferson to try to help Gonzales. The Viceroy also sent warnings to the Viceroy of New Spain in Mexico City, which was forwarded to the Spanish naval bases at San Blas and Acapulco, and to the Spanish missions in California. The messages described the Columbia and Washington and details of their expedition, with orders that if either appeared they were to be seized and the crews arrested as pirates. The crews of both Columbia and Washington began to suffer from scurvy as they continued north.Ridley (2000), pp. 58‚Äì59 On August 2, 1788, the crew of Washington sighted land near the present border of California and Oregon, near the mouth of the Klamath River. After a friendly but brief encounter with a group of natives in a large redwood canoe, they continued north, looking for a safe harbor. They sailed past many native villages and encampments before finding a harbor deemed safe, in the vicinity of Tillamook Bay. They attracted the attention of many natives who began visiting the sloop for trade, offering, among other things, sea otter skins and fresh food, including baskets of berries, which helped relieve the symptoms of scurvy. Haswell noted that these natives had smallpox scars and carried steel knives, indicating previous encounters with trading vessels. On August 13, Gray anchored Washington in a protected inlet near a native village.Ridley (2000), pp. 60‚Äì61 The sloop remained in this harbor for five days. Many natives came to trade and parties were sent ashore to collect water and wood. After a couple days Gray decided to leave but Washington grounded on a rocky reef. While waiting for high tide one last party was sent ashore where an altercation occurred. In the ensuing chaos crewmember Marcus Lopius was killed. Officers Coolidge and Haswell, and another crewmember were wounded as they fled into the surf to their longboat. Native war canoes tried to capture the longboat and, failing that, positioned themselves between Washington and the open sea. During the night Washington was freed from the reef and tried to escape but grounded again, on a shoal. At high tide the next day, August 18, Washington was freed again. The sloop's swivel guns were used to hold off the war canoes and Washington escaped into the open ocean. Gray set a course for Nootka Sound, still far to the north.Ridley (2000), pp. 62‚Äì65 Shortly after this the Spanish war frigate Princesa, under Jos√© Esteban Mart√≠nez, and the packet San Carlos, under Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro, both sailing south from Alaska, passed but failed to spot Washington. Two weeks later they passed Columbia, again without visual contact. The next year Mart√≠nez and Haro would establish Santa Cruz de Nuca at Nootka Sound and, with Kendrick and Gray present, trigger events leading to the Nootka Crisis.Ridley (2000), pp. 69‚Äì70 =Nootka Sound 1788‚Äì1789= Friendly Cove in 1792. From volume I, plate VII from: A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean and Round the World by George Vancouver. Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez. Callicum and Maquinna from the Italian translation of John Meares' Voyages (Naples 1796). Washington arrived at Friendly Cove in Nootka Sound on September 16, 1788, finding another ship already there: Felice Adventurer, under John Meares, a British vessel but flying a Portuguese false flag to avoid paying for an East India Company licence, required of British merchants in China. Two more vessels arrived, Iphigenia Nubiana under William Douglas, who would later partner with Kendrick, and North West America under Robert Funter. The North West America was built at Nootka Sound and launched on September 20. All three vessels were part of a fur trading venture under Meares. After a few days Meares left, and shortly after, on September 22, Kendrick's Columbia arrived. Kendrick re- assumed command of both ships and the expedition as a whole.Ridley (2000), pp. 75‚Äì77, 81 On October 26, 1788, the remaining two British ships left for Hawaii and China. Once they were gone Kendrick announced that the expedition would spend the winter in Nootka Sound. They would befriend the native Nuu-chah- nulth people and gain an advantage in the fur trade over the competing British ships. During the winter Kendrick met and established friendly relations with the Nuu-chah-nulth chiefs Maquinna and Wickaninnish.Nokes, pp. 85-88 Kendrick knew Meares's ships would return after the winter. By staying at Nootka Sound he hoped to preempt the British by getting an early start. After the winter, Kendrick sent Washington under Gray out on a short trading voyage to the south. Departing on March 16, 1789, Gray visited Wickaninnish in Clayoquot Sound and cruised south looking for the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He collected many sea otter pelts in Clayoquot Sound and found the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca before returning to Nootka Sound on April 22. Gray found the Iphigenia under William Douglas anchored at Friendly Cove, having arrived on April 19 after wintering in Hawaii. A few days later Funter's North West America arrived, also from Hawaii.Pethick (1976), p. 147 Kendrick had moved Columbia to a cove known as Mawina or Mowina, today called Marvinas Bay, about deeper into Nootka Sound. He had fortified a small island and built an outpost on it, with a house, gun battery, blacksmith forge, and outbuildings. Kendrick called it Fort Washington. It was the first US outpost on the Pacific coast. Kendrick intended it to be the foundation of an American presence on the Pacific Northwest coast, and as a headquarters for controlling the fur trade. Over the summer Kendrick used the outpost and his friendship with the Nuu- chah-nulth to collect hundreds of furs from the region.Ridley (2000), pp. 97, 112‚Äì113 Kendrick had decided that Columbia was too unwieldy for close sailing on the Pacific Northwest coast. The smaller, more maneuverable Washington was better suited for trading. Therefore, almost immediately after arriving Washington was readied for another trading voyage. The British captains Douglas and Funter had discovered that Kendrick had control of the fur trade around Nootka Sound and that Gray had been trading in the south. Therefore the North West America set off northward to seek furs and Iphigenia prepared to do likewise. On May 2, days after North West America had left, Gray took Washington north as well.Nokes, pp. 90Ridley (2000), p. 98 While sailing away from Nootka Sound Gray encountered Princesa, under Spanish naval officer Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez, who had come to take possession of Nootka Sound for Spain. Mart√≠nez informed the officers of the Washington that they were trespassing in Spanish waters and demanded to know their business. Gray and his officers showed him a passport and made weak excuses for being on the Northwest Coast. Mart√≠nez knew they were dissembling but let them go, knowing that the command ship Columbia was trapped in Nootka Sound.Haswell (1990), pp. 84‚Äì86 Mart√≠nez anchored in Friendly Cove, Nootka Sound, on May 5, 1789. Within the day Douglas and Francisco Jos√© Viana, the nominal captain of the Iphigenia, were meeting with Mart√≠nez on Princesa. Kendrick soon arrived and joined them. When questioned about his presence at Nootka Sound Kendrick dissembled, saying Columbia had been badly damaged and the crew suffering from scurvy. They had put into Nootka for repairs and recovery. Kendrick told Mart√≠nez that, expecting to have to winter at Nootka, he had built a house for the crew, a blacksmith forge, and a gun emplacement for protection. He said he had sent Washington north to look for material for barrel hoops. Kendrick readily acknowledged Spanish authority in the region and said he would leave as soon as Columbia was repaired.Ridley (2000), pp. 103‚Äì105 Douglas gave similar excuses for Iphigenia and gave over the ship's papers which, being in Portuguese, Mart√≠nez held for translation.Ridley (2000), pp. 103‚Äì105 Fort San Miguel, Friendly Cove, in 1793. Kendrick saw the arrival of Mart√≠nez as potentially beneficial for his own goals, and he treated Mart√≠nez with deference and courtesy. He offered Mart√≠nez the use of his blacksmith, provided sail canvas, deck fixtures, and introduced him to the local Nuu-chah- nulth, seeking to promote friendship. Douglas later claimed that Kendrick and Mart√≠nez made an alliance against him and the British in general. Later still, John Meares accused Kendrick of convincing Mart√≠nez to seize British ships, though Kendrick denied it. It is not clear whether Kendrick agreed with Mart√≠nez's plan for seize Iphigenia, but Mart√≠nez did tell Kendrick he planned to arrest Meares when his command ship arrived, and gained Kendrick's complicity in that regard. Whatever the case, Kendrick had a motive for encouraging Spanish‚ÄìBritish conflict, whether tacitly or directly, since it would reduce British competition in the fur trade and give him more time to establish an American outpost.Ridley (2000), pp. 106‚Äì107 On May 12, 1789, the Spanish vessel San Carlos arrived. With this reinforcement in place, Mart√≠nez seized Iphigenia and arrested the crew. This alarmed Chief Maquinna, who moved his Nuu-chah-nulth people from Friendly Cove to a village deeper into Nootka Sound.Ridley (2000), pp. 108‚Äì110 After a couple weeks Mart√≠nez, in a tricky diplomatic situation, decided to let Iphigenia go after Douglas agreed to certain conditions. Kendrick and Ingraham acted at witnesses to the agreements. Among the conditions Mart√≠nez required Douglas to promise to leave the Pacific Northwest and never return‚Äîa promise he broke immediately upon leaving Nootka Sound as he sailed north to cruise the coast for furs.Ridley (2000), pp. 110‚Äì112 Douglas sailed from Nootka Sound around the start of June. On June 8, 1789, the North West America returned. Mart√≠nez confiscated the vessel as security for payments Douglas owed for repairs and supplies given to Iphigenia.Ridley (2000), pp. 112‚Äì113 On June 15, 1789, Meares's small sloop , under Thomas Hudson, arrived at Friendly Cove. Needing repairs and in no condition to resist, Hudson readily accepted Mart√≠nez's authority.Ridley (2000), p. 114 Robert Gray returned to Nootka Sound on June 17, finding the Spanish in control, Fort San Miguel built, North West America captured and Princess Royal detained. Gray sailed Lady Washington directly to Kendrick's outpost at Marvinas Bay. While Gray had been away Kendrick's friendship with the natives had resulted in his collecting of hundreds of furs. Thinking they would soon depart, Kendrick took Columbia and Washington to Friendly Cove, anchoring there on June 28. On July 2, Mart√≠nez let the Princess Royal depart. Within hours Meares's command ship Argonaut under James Colnett arrived.Ridley (2000), pp. 112‚Äì118 The arrest of James Colnett. Mart√≠nez and Colnett clashed right away, each claiming Nootka Sound by authority of their respective kings. Despite his misgivings, Colnett allowed Argonaut to be brought into Friendly Cove and tied to Princesa and Columbia. As tensions rose while Mart√≠nez and Colnett continued to argue, Kendrick, knowing that Mart√≠nez was planning to seize Argonaut, prepared for the possibility of violence. The next day the arguments between Mart√≠nez and Colnett nearly turned violent, and Mart√≠nez had Colnett arrested. Mart√≠nez had Princesa's cannon loaded and ready, and asked Kendrick to do the same with Columbia, which he did. Seeing Argonaut trapped between the two ships as well as the cannon of Fort San Miguel, Colnett realized that resistance was futile.Ridley (2000), pp. 119‚Äì126 The events set in motion during the summer of 1789, especially the seizure of Argonaut, lead to the Nootka Crisis. It took time for the news to reach Europe, but when it did it nearly resulted in war between Britain and Spain. =Northwest coast 1789= On July 13, 1789, the day after Mart√≠nez seized Princess Royal, the Nuu-chah-nulth leader, Callicum, the son of Maquinna, went to Friendly Cove. He called angrily to Mart√≠nez, who shot him dead with a musket. Sources differ over the details of the event, but whatever the case it deepened the rift between the Spanish and Nuu-chah-nulth. Maquinna fled to Clayoquot Sound. online at Google Books The next day Kendrick decided it was time to leave Nootka Sound.Ridley (2000), pp. 133‚Äì136 Kendrick asked Mart√≠nez if he would be allowed to return to Nootka Sound the next year. Mart√≠nez agreed, with certain conditions and requests, to which Kendrick agreed. Mart√≠nez asked Kendrick to take the prisoners from North West America to Macau, offering 96 sea otter skins to cover expenses. He also asked Kendrick to sell 137 prime sea otter skins in Macau for him. Mart√≠nez also offered to deliver letters from the Americans. Kendrick wrote to Joseph Barrell, but knowing the letter would probably be read by the Spanish, kept his message short. He said he would cruise north then proceed to China, where he expected to receive instructions from Barrell. He also wrote a letter to his wife Huldah. Kendrick's son, John Kendrick Jr, announced that he had decided to stay at Nootka Sound and join the Spanish Navy. An account by a Spanish officer described the elder Kendrick standing in tears as he gave advice and said goodbye to his son. On July 15 Columbia and Washington, under Kendrick and Gray, left Nootka Sound. Instead of cruising north they sailed south to Clayoquot Sound, where they stayed for two weeks. The ships anchored near Opitsaht, the largest native village in the area and home to Chief Wickaninnish. Kendrick and his men knew many of the natives at Opitsaht, some of whom had recently come from Nootka Sound. Trading began immediately and continued during their time there.Ridley (2000), pp. 137‚Äì138 While at Clayoquot Sound, Kendrick and Gray switched vessels. Kendrick ordered Gray to take Columbia to China, and Kendrick would take Washington north, trading for furs. Kendrick recognized that with the British driven off out of the trade due to the Nootka Crisis the Americans had a window of opportunity on the Northwest Coast. All the furs in Washington were transferred to Columbia and the crews were divided so Kendrick would have a full complement of experienced sailors on Washington. On July 30 Gray sailed Columbia out of Clayoquot Sound, making for Hawaii and China.Nokes, pp. 109-110 The reason for this exchange of ships remains unknown, but one reason could be that Kendrick thought Washington was easier to handle because she was smaller. Whatever the reason, Gray returned to Boston via Canton, later taking a second expedition in Columbia that would enter the Columbia River on the modern Washington-Oregon border, and result in its naming for the ship. Kendrick's movements after leaving Clayoquot Sound are unknown. The next confirmed report dates to September, about a month after leaving Clayoquot. Kendrick encountered Thomas Metcalfe's Fair American near Dundas Island and Dixon Entrance. Metcalfe continued to Nootka Sound and told Mart√≠nez about meeting Kendrick. Mart√≠nez wrote that Kendrick was in \\"one of the mouths of the Strait of Fonte\\". How Kendrick got from Clayoquot to Dixon Entrance is not known. There is some evidence that he might have entered the Salish Sea, passing east of Vancouver Island.Ridley (2000), pp. 142‚Äì145 After his meeting with Metcalfe, Kendrick sailed across Hecate Strait to Haida Gwaii. His activities there are not known in detail but he likely stopped at several Haida villages such as Skidegate and Skedans. At Anthony Island, or SGÃ±ang Gwaay, he traded with the Haida village of Ninstints, under Chief Koyah, or Coyah.Ridley (2010), pp. 145-149 Ninstints had been visited by George Dixon in 1787, and by Robert Gray in June, 1789, when Kendrick sent him north to trade. Robert Haswell's account of Ninstints during Gray's visit is the earliest written description. Kendrick arrived at Ninstints about three months after Gray's visit. While Kendrick trading at Ninstints minor thefts from the ship caused some tension. One day Kendrick's clothes, which had been hung out to dry, were stolen. Kendrick had Chief Koyah and Chief Skulkinanse held as hostages until the stolen goods were returned. The clothes and most other missing items were returned. Knowing that trading would be over once the chiefs were released Kendrick demanded all the remaining furs be brought for trade. Some accounts say Kendrick paid for these furs at the same rate he had been paying, others say he forced the Haida to accept a lower rate. After this the chiefs were released and Kendrick left. The incident caused Koyah to lose his chieftainship, although later traders still had to work with him and he seemed to retain an important role in Ninstints. Robert Gray returned to Ninstints in 1792 and Robert Haswell wrote what he claimed was the Haida account of the incident. He said that Kendrick had tied a rope around Koyah's neck, whipped him, cut off his hair and painted his face, among other things. Two years later, when Kendrick returned, the Haida had not forgotten this treatment and a battle ensued. The natives captured the arms chest of Washington. Kendrick and his crew had to retreat below decks. He and his officers fought off the attack. Kendrick, seeking revenge, killed a native woman who had encouraged the attack in the water after her arm had been severed by a cutlass and killed many other natives with cannon and small arms fire as they retreated. =Hawaii 1789= Kendrick went to the Hawaiian Islands, arriving in November, 1789. Lady Washington was the 15th Western ship known to have visited Hawaii after James Cook.Ridley (2000), pp. 160‚Äì161 Kendrick sailed around the Island of Hawaii and anchored in Kealakekua Bay, not far from where Cook had been killed in 1779. Native Hawaiians came aboard to trade. Kendrick asked for Chief Ka ªiana, who had been on the Iphigenia at Nootka Sound and was friendly to Kendrick and other traders. Ka ªiana brought Kendrick a letter from Richard Howe, the clerk of Columbia, which had been in Hawaii in August. The letter warned of native duplicity and told of an attack on Iphigenia that summer. Kendrick also learned of the complicated and changing political situation in Hawaii. Chief Kamehameha I and his sub-chiefs, such as Ka ªiana were expanding their power and eager to acquire firearms, which they had been obtaining from other traders. Kendrick was reluctant to trade firearms, fearing his own safety, but probably provided a few in trade for provisions.Ridley (2000), pp. 166‚Äì175 During his stay at Kealakekua Bay Kendrick recognized sandalwood. Knowing that sandalwood was prized in China he asked Kamehameha for permission to leave a man to harvest sandalwood for later pickup. Kamehameha wanted assistance training his men in the use of firearms. The details of the deal are not known, but whatever the exact terms Kamehameha agreed and Kendrick left his carpenter Isaac Ridler and two others, James Mackay and Samuel Thomas. After leaving Kealakekua Bay Kendrick sailed through the island chain. He stopped at Kauai and Niihau to top off his provisions with water, yams, and hogs. Then he made for Macau, China. Shortly after Kendrick's visit to Hawaii, another trader, Simon Metcalfe killed about a hundred Hawaiians in an event called the Olowalu Massacre. About the same time the small ship Fair American, captained by Simon Metcalfe's son Thomas Metcalfe, was attacked and captured. The Fair American and the one survivor, Isaac Davis, came under the control of Kamehameha. Kendrick's three men, along with Isaac Davis and a man left by Simon Metcalfe, John Young, all found their lives at risk and survived by serving under Kamehameha, teaching Hawaiians not only how to use muskets but also how to sail the Fair American and use its cannons. These things helped Kamehameha invade Maui and begin his conquest of all the Hawaiian Islands.Ridley (2000), pp. 176‚Äì178 =Macau 1790‚Äì1791= Modern replica of Lady Washington as a brig or brigantine, imitating Kendrick's refit at Macau. Kendrick anchored about a mile offshore of Macau on January 26, 1790. Gray had arrived in November and by January had made it to Whampoa, a trading center near Guangzhou (Canton), about up the Pearl River. Both captains found trading difficult under the Canton System. Kendrick sent a letter to Gray, telling of his arrival and asking for advice on how to proceed. Gray sent a letter back along with letters from Joseph Barrell, the owner of their venture. Gray described his difficulties with the Canton System and suggested Kendrick go to a smuggling area called Dirty Butter Bay on the west side of Montanha Island (today part of Hengqin). Gray also provided the names of buyers who would assist in smuggling. The letters from Barrell were friendly and reaffirmed Kendrick's command of the venture and broad authority to continue as he judged best.Ridley (2000), pp. 180‚Äì188 Kendrick took Lady Washington to Dirty Butter Bay on January 30, 1790. He found it rife with smuggling and illegal activity. There were two East India Company hulks acting as floating warehouses full of opium. Kendrick received another letter from Gray, who suggested Kendrick sell his cargo to Gray's agent in Whampoa, and that Gray would take the money himself. Kendrick refused, saying he might bring Washington up to Whampoa. To this Gray replied, warning of the difficulties involved and suggesting Kendrick remain where he was. Kendrick wrote back with various questions. He asserted his command of the joint venture by asking for a full account of the cargo sold and remaining on Columbia, the amount and quality of Chinese goods acquired, and other details. Gray refused to provide Kendrick with this information. Gray wrote to Barrell that he had brought 700 skins to China although it was later determined that he had sold 1,215 skins and tampered with the inventory records from Clayoquot Sound. Whatever the case, Gray's cargo was sold for $21,400, a fairly low price per skin. About half of this money was spent on the costs of his long stay at Whampoa, leaving $11,241. With that he bought 221 chests of cheap tea. About half of the tea was spoiled by the time Gray returned to Boston and Barrell took a financial loss for Gray's first voyage. Before Gray left China Kendrick sent him a number of artifacts he had collected on the Pacific Northwest Coast, to be brought back to New England for a new museum (today the Peabody Essex Museum). Kendrick, having not received an accounting of Gray's business in Whampoa, sent a copy of his letter asking for such, but again Gray ignored it. On February 9, 1790, Gray left Whampoa. While waiting for a storm to pass Gray anchored Columbia less than from Lady Washington, but avoided all contact and communication. On February 12, he left for Boston. Kendrick fell ill with a long fever, and fell into debt. But by spring his prospects improved. The fever abated. He sold Mart√≠nez's furs for $8,000 and his own for $18,000, a far better price per fur than Gray had managed. Now flush with cash he paid his debts and rented a house in Macau while making various preparations for a return voyage to the Pacific Northwest. He had Lady Washington refitting as a brigantine similar to the privateer Fanny he had captained during the Revolutionary War. A second mast was added to Washington, along with new sails and rigging.Ridley (2000), pp. 188‚Äì191 As spring progressed Kendrick found himself stuck in Macau. The Chinese refused to give him permission to leave port and the Portuguese Governor of Macau, Lazaro da Silva Ferreira, would not intervene. The reason for this is unclear. Stuck in Macau, Kendrick asked William Douglas for assistance. Douglas had been captain of Iphigenia but had left Meares's company and taken command of the American schooner Grace, sailing under a US flag. Kendrick's first mate, Davis Coolidge, became Douglas's first mate. Kendrick and Douglas formed a loose partnership. Douglas was about to sail to the Pacific Northwest. He agreed to stop in Hawaii on the way back and pick up Kendrick's sandalwood. Around this time John Meares arrived in London, where he began to fan the flames of the Nootka Crisis, which was rapidly heading toward war between Britain and Spain. Part of Meares's claims, made to Parliament and Prime Minister William Pitt, was that Kendrick was the true architect behind the Spanish seizure of British ships at Nootka Sound. News of impending war between Britain and Spain reached Macau in the summer of 1790. Kendrick was arrested by soldiers in Macau and ordered to leave. He retreated to Washington in Dirty Butter Bay.Ridley (2000), pp. 195‚Äì198 On August 9, 1790, Gray returned to Boston with Columbia. There were large celebrations of this first US circumnavigation and Gray became a national hero. However, the venture was a failure financially. Gray and Haswell blamed Kendrick for the failure. Some were skeptical of Gray's claims about Kendrick, such as the clerk John Hoskins and Joseph Barrell himself. In addition, questions were raised about the total number of furs Gray sold in China. Gray said they sold 700 skins, with Haswell's records as evidence. Barrell's agent at Canton said there were at least 1,215 furs, and perhaps more than 1,500. The discrepancy was never resolved.Ridley (2000), pp. 199‚Äì211 Gray proposed another venture in which he would have command of Columbia, with Haswell as first mate, and without Kendrick's overall command. While Columbia was being made ready controversy grew over Kendrick's role in the first venture. Newspapers published articles condemning Kendrick and calling him a rogue and a cheat. He was also held responsible for the Nootka Crisis and the looming war. John Quincy Adams wrote about Kendrick's \\"egregious knavery and unpardonable stupidity\\". Solomon Kendrick, who had returned with Gray, quickly joined another venture and left Boston for the Pacific Northwest on Jefferson, under captain Josiah Roberts. Joseph Ingraham did likewise, obtaining command of the sloop and leaving Boston on September 17, 1790. The Columbia left Boston on October 2, 1790, with Gray as captain and Haswell as first mate. Joseph Barrell placed John Hoskins on board as supercargo. Barrell gave Hoskins broad authority in the management of cargo and instructed Gray to consult with him on all matters of trade. On October 28, 1790, the First Nootka Convention was signed, averting a British‚ÄìSpanish war. Under the agreement Spain was to pay damages for John Meares's seized ships and to return the land in Nootka Sound that Meares claimed to have purchased. George Vancouver was to sail to Nootka Sound to implement the agreement. His voyage, known as the Vancouver Expedition, along with the Butterworth Squadronwould later play a major role in John Kendrick's life as well as his death.Ridley (2000), pp. 212‚Äì221 During all this time Kendrick remained at Dirty Butter Bay, unable to leave due to the restrictions that had been placed upon him. In late 1790 a new governor of Macau, Vasco Luis Caneiro de Sousa de Faro, was appointed, and Kendrick's restrictions were lifted. By this time Douglas had returned with a cargo of furs, Kendrick's Hawaiian sandalwood, and Kendrick's men James Mackay and Samuel Thomas. After selling the furs and sandalwood the two captains decided to sail together to Japan in an attempt to open trade there. They left China on March 31, 1791. =Japan= Kendrick left Macau in March, 1791, along with William Douglas, formerly captain of the Iphigenia but now of an American ship called Grace. They decided to attempt to open trade with Japan, which was closed to almost all foreign trade under the sakoku policy.Ridley (2010), pp. 219‚Äì220 Kendrick and Douglas approached the Kii Peninsula of Japan on May 6. Seeking shelter from an approaching typhoon Kendrick and Douglas sailed into the channel between the mainland and the island of Kii ≈åshima, near the fishing villages of Kushimoto and Koza. Both villages immediately sent messages to the daimy≈ç at Wakayama Castle. After the storm passed a few Japanese fishermen visited the ships. Kendrick offered food and drink, and a few of the fishermen went on board. None of the ships crewmembers spoke Japanese, but the Chinese crewmen were able to communicate via writing. Kendrick and Douglas learned that there was no market for sea otter furs in Japan, contrary to the rumors they had heard in Macau. The fishermen also persuaded Kendrick and Douglas not to go to Osaka, where they would have faced certain arrest.Ridley (2010), pp. 222‚Äì225 While they waited for favorable weather five men were sent ashore on Oshima Island to collect water and wood. They fired a warning musket shot at a local farmer who tried to stop them. In the meantime the messages from the villages reached Wakayama Castle and the daimy≈ç sent a force of samurai. On May 17, Kendrick and Douglas departed, perhaps having heard that troops were coming. The samurai arrived two days later.Ridley (2010), pp. 224‚Äì225 The result of this first visit of Americans to Japan was largely symbolic for the United States. For Japan it resulted in a new system of alarms and coastal patrols, increasing Japan's isolation under sakoku.Ridley (2010), p. 225 A few days after leaving the Kii Peninsula Kendrick and Douglas came across some islands not on any charts they had. Possibly part of the Nanp≈ç Islands, they named them the \\"Water Islands\\". Here they decided to separate. Douglas sailed to Alaska, perhaps by way of Hawaii, while Kendrick made for the Pacific Northwest coast.Ridley (2010), p. 226 Northwest Coast 1791 In early June, 1791, Kendrick arrived at Bucareli Bay. He spent about a week trading in Tsimshian and Haida territory. He visited several villages in Haida Gwaii before arriving at the southern end of the islands.Ridley (2000), pp. 226‚Äì229 On June 13 he visited the Haida village XÃ±yuu Daw Llnagaay, also spelled Ce- uda‚Äôo Inagai. The village is located on a point north-east of Saawdaan GÃ±awGÃ±a, or Keeweenah Bay, near Ninstints in the territory of Koyah, with whom Kendrick had had trouble in 1789. Sources differ over exactly how events unfolded. Whatever the details, trading proceeded in a friendly manner for a couple of days and many Haida from the region came. A festive mood developed and Kendrick relaxed his security. Kendrick was told that Koyah was no longer a chief, and when Koyah came he appeared to hold no ill feelings. Kendrick allowed about 50 Haida, men and women, aboard his ship. Koyah joined the Haida trading on board, having brought his own furs to trade. By some accounts Kendrick traded a blue nankeen coat to Koyah. During the trading on board one of the Haida chiefs, perhaps Koyah according to some versions of the story, went to the quarterdeck and gained control of one of the weapon chests. At this point Haida warriors, in what seems to have been an unplanned attack, drew knives and menaced the crew, who retreated to the middle deck and then below deck. The Haida gained control of the ship's deck. Haida canoes had crowded alongside Washington and more warriors boarded. According to some accounts Koyah began taunting Kendrick, now alone on the quarterdeck. There was little Kendrick could do. He tried to bargain with Koyah, offering to pay the Haida to leave the ship, to no avail. While the men below were arming themselves with weapon stores in the hold, and preparing to blow up the ship if necessary, Kendrick and Koyah fought near the companionway. Koyah wounded Kendrick with his knife twice in the abdomen. Crewmembers began to fire at the Haida warriors. Kendrick retrieved a pistol from his cabin and led the crew back on deck. A hand-to-hand battle ensued. About 15 Haida, men and women, were killed in the struggle. One Haida woman had climbed up the chains supporting the mainmast and had been shouting encouragement to the Haida, urging them to fight. Although badly wounded she remained aloft until all the other Haida had fled the ship, at which point she jumped into the sea and attempted to swim despite having lost an arm in the battle. She was shot as she struggled in the water. The crew fired upon the retreating Haida with muskets and cannon, and pursued them in boats. Many Haida died in the battle. Koyah was shot but survived. His wife and child were killed according to some accounts. The battle became a famous and oft-told story, and accounts portrayed Kendrick in differing ways. One second-hand account claimed that Kendrick had been drinking. Others blamed for letting the Haida gain control of the ship as well as allowing the brutal retaliation following the regaining of control. Still others found the slaughter hard to believe and supported Kendrick's actions. Having been treated as 'ahliko', or a lower class person, Koyah had lost face according to Haida law. His family and allies went on to capture two vessels to restore the honour of his matrilineage according to Haida law. Kendrick left immediately and went to Bucareli Bay where he and his crew spent a few weeks recuperating before sailing to Nootka Sound. He did not know what the current situation would be at Nootka Sound. He had not yet that the Nootka Convention had been signed in late 1790, preventing war. For all he knew a global war might have begun. Therefore Kendrick entered Nootka Sound in a dramatic fashion, with cannons loaded and matches lit, and the crew all armed and ready to fire.Ridley (2000), pp. 229‚Äì231 The Spanish officer Francisco de Eliza had re-established the fort at Friendly Cove but was away exploring the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Strait of Georgia. The acting commandant, Ram√≥n Saavedra, sent an armed boat, telling Kendrick that Nootka Sound belonged to Spain and no one could enter or trade without permission. Kendrick defiantly said they had come to trade and would do so. Saavedra decided to take no action and await the return of Eliza. Kendrick arrived at his old base in Marvinas Bay, Nootka Sound, on July 12. At Marvinas Bay Kendrick was welcomed by the native Nuu-chah-nulth. The friendship he had forged with them had lasted and was even strengthened by their continued frustration with the Spanish. Kendrick began to negotiate alliances with chiefs Maquinna, Claquakinnah, Wickaninish, and others. From Saavedra he learned of the Nootka Convention and that British traders would be allowed back to Nootka Sound and permitted to trade along the coast. Kendrick hoped that a strong alliance with the natives could help him out-compete the British traders who would soon be returning.Ridley (2000), pp. 231‚Äì232 Many chiefs gathered at Marvinas Bay. Kendrick entertained them with Chinese fireworks. He warned them that both the Spanish and British were coming in larger numbers with the intention of taking over the land. Kendrick told them that if he held deeds to their land it could prevent Spanish and British conquest. He promised that they would retain all the rights and that he was essentially asking for the right to use the region as one of the Nuu-chah-nulth. Additionally he would be bound to defend the lands against Europeans and other tribes outside their confederation. But the most important thing he offered, from the Nuu- chah-nulth perspective, was firearms. If they were well-armed they could defend themselves against traders who previously had felt free to raid villages and shoot natives. The memory of Maquinna's brother Callicum being shot to death by the Spanish was still fresh.Ridley (2000), pp. 232‚Äì238 The chiefs agreed to Kendrick's proposal. In July 1791 Kendrick purchased Marvinas Bay from Maquinna and other chiefs, with \\"all the land, rivers, creeks, harbours, islands, etc., with all the produce of sea and land appertaining thereto.\\" Kendrick then went to Tahsis, deeper into Nootka Sound, and made a similar agreement. Then he maneuvered Washington through the narrows north of Nootka Island into Esperanza Inlet, thereby avoiding the Spanish fort at Friendly Cove. In Esperanza Inlet and Nuchatlitz Inlet he made two more land purchases of the same sort. In early August 1791, Kendrick sailed south to Clayoquot Sound. Chief Wickaninnish, having heard of Kendrick's activities, was waiting for him, prepared to make a similar deal of land for firearms. On August 11, 1791, Wickaninnish and other chiefs granted Kendrick essentially all the land around Clayoquot Sound. The deed mentions only four muskets traded in exchange, although by 1792 Wickaninnish was said to have acquired about 200 muskets from Kendrick.Ridley (2000), pp. 238‚Äì246 Kendrick's land purchases collectively gave him title to over of Vancouver Island, including nearly all of Nootka Island and the lands around Nootka Sound and Clayoquot Sound. Following these purchases, Kendrick built a new Fort Washington on an island in Clayoquot Sound. On August 29, 1791, the Columbia arrived at Clayoquot Sound, having returned to the Pacific Northwest on a second voyage. Robert Gray was captain and no longer under Kendrick's command. Robert Haswell was first mate. The supercargo was John Hoskins, sent by Joseph Barrell to oversee the business and finances of the venture. From Hoskins Kendrick learned of other traders on the coast‚Äîat least three American and five British ships. These vessels were mostly trading in the north, having found few furs on Vancouver Island: Kendrick had already acquired most of them and had negotiated advance payments for future furs. Joseph Ingraham later wrote that the natives around Nootka Sound always asked about Kendrick, saying they had many furs for him and would not sell to anyone else. The day after arriving some of the officers of Columbia visited Kendrick's Fort Washington, which Hoskins described as a rough log outpost with living quarters and a warehouse, with a US flag flying. Lady Washington had been hauled on shore and was being graved in preparation for sailing to Hawaii and China. Kendrick was given a letter from Joseph Barrell, from which he learned that Columbia was no longer under his command. In a reply letter Kendrick pointed out how unfortunate this was, since he could have added over 1,000 sea otter skins to the 500‚Äì600 Gray had gathered. Seeking some way to make this work, Kendrick offered Hoskins 1,000 furs in exchange for payment for his men and his Macau debts, which were about $4,000. Hoskins said he did not have the authority. Thus, lacking further instructions from Barrell, Kendrick found himself on his own with Washington. He decided to continue on as he had been. Matters with Barrell could be resolved later. Launch of Adventure with Columbia and Robert Gray's Fort Defiance in background. Painting by George Davidson, who served as an artist on Columbia. Borrowing Kendrick's strategy from the first voyage, Gray planned to winter in Clayoquot Sound so as to get an early start the next year. Kendrick helped tow Columbia to a cove for the winter. After Kendrick left Gray had his men build an outpost he named Fort Defiance. On September 29, 1791, Kendrick sailed for Hawaii. Over the winter Gray proved unable to maintain the friendship with Wickaninnish's people that Kendrick had built. In an incident over a coat Gray took Wickaninnish's brother hostage, threatening to kill him. Later, Gray's Hawaiian servant deserted and went into hiding among the natives. In retaliation Gray took another hostage. Toward the end of the winter Gray discovered what he thought was a conspiracy to attack his outpost and ship. In response Gray decided to destroy Opitsaht, the main native town of Clayoquot Sound and seat of Wickaninnish. As Columbia left Clayoquot Sound in March 1792, Gray ordered a cannonade upon Opitsaht, which was utterly destroyed. Although the town was empty at the time it contained over 200 ornately carved buildings. John Boit wrote of his sadness to see the town destroyed, noting that every door had been elegantly carved, often in the form of a totemic animal whose mouth functioned as the entry. Wickaninnish's people remained loyal to Kendrick, but their good feelings toward American traders over the British, which Kendrick had obtained, was largely ruined by Gray's actions. Hawaii and Macau 1791‚Äì1793 Kendrick arrived at Kealakekua Bay on the Island of Hawaii in late October, 1791. From Ka ªiana Kendrick learned that Kamehameha was now king of the entire island and that there was turmoil, danger, and ongoing war among most of the Hawaiian Islands. Kendrick left Kealakekua Bay after a few days and sailed to the island of Kauai, which was relatively safe at the western end of the main islands. By October 27, 1791, he was at Kauai. With the approval of Chief Inamo ªo, who was serving as regent while Chief Kaumualii was away, Kendrick left three men on the nearby island of Niiahu. John Williams, John Rowbottom, and James Coleman were to work on Niihau and Kauai, trading for pearls and preparing cargoes of sandalwood.Ridley (2000), pp. 246‚Äì249 Kendrick arrived at Macau on December 7, 1791, and was soon again anchored at the smugglers haven Dirty Butter Bay. Several other American traders were there, including Joseph Ingraham of the Hope, Crowell of the Hancock, and Coolidge of the Grace. The Fairy arrived soon after Kendrick. From these traders Kendrick learned of his diminished reputation in Boston. On March 28, 1792, he wrote to Joseph Barrell, defending himself against the charges made against him and describing how Gray had cheated Barrell by under-reporting furs sold in Macau and selling the difference for his personal profit. He also described the land purchases he had made and promised to send copies of the deeds. Lacking specific instructions he proposed that he would continue in Barrell's employ \\"as usual\\", including, he suggested, command of Columbia. Alternatively, if Barrell was not interested in continuing the relationship, he proposed buying Lady Washington for $14,000, plus interest, and operating on his own. He entrusted the letter to Ebenezer Dorr, who had come to Macau with Ingraham on the Hope and was returning to Boston on the Fairy.Ridley (2000), pp. 263‚Äì266 Kendrick could not expect a reply from Barrell for at least a year. In the meantime he decided to strengthen his position in Hawaii and on the Northwest Coast. Not longer after Dorr and most of the other traders left Kendrick fell ill. When Ingraham left on April 1, 1792, he described Kendrick as near death. In time Kendrick recovered and, over the summer of 1792, built a tender for Washington. Named Avenger or Adventure, it was probably a sloop about long, with a crew of about ten. It was finished in the late summer and command was given to John Stoddard, who had served as clerk on Washington for two years.Ridley (2000), pp. 280‚Äì287 Kendrick and Stoddard sailed from Macau in September, 1792, planning to winter in Clayoquot Sound. Only a few days out they were caught in a violent typhoon, during which Washington was badly damaged and Avenger was lost, never to be seen again. Kendrick returned to Macau and took loans to pay for the major repairs Washington needed. About two months after this, the Columbia arrived at Macau. Kendrick sent a letter telling of the death of Stoddard and the crew of Avenger, news that the crew of Columbia would want to know. Otherwise Kendrick and Gray did not meet or communicate with each other. Gray found the price of furs very low and the second voyage of Columbia made little profit. On February 8, 1793, Columbia left for Boston. Through others Kendrick learned that Gray had fought with Wickaninnish's people in Clayoquot Sound, and had killed Wickaninnish's brother. He also learned of Gray's discovery of the Columbia River. In addition Kendrick learned about the British Vancouver Expedition under George Vancouver and the Butterworth Squadron under William Brown. Kendrick learned much of this information from John Howell, who joined the crew of Washington as clerk in Macau. Howell, who was fluent in Spanish, had served as interpreter for Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra at Nootka Sound during the diplomatic negotiations with George Vancouver in 1792. Howell arrived in Macau on the Margaret, under James Magee. Magee had hired Howell as a \\"historian\\". The two had collected native artifacts from the Pacific Northwest Coast and the Hawaiian Islands. Howell would take command of Washington after Kendrick's death. In late February, 1793, Kendrick sailed the repaired Washington about east to Hong Kong Island. There, knowing that both Britain and Spain were seeking to lay claim to the Pacific Northwest and wanting to secure his own claims for the United States, Kendrick wrote to Thomas Jefferson. He described the land purchases he had made and included copies of the deeds. He wrote of his hope and belief that the United States would sanction and secure them, and protect them from Britain and Spain if necessary. He described the commercial advantages that could come from American possession of lands on the Northwest Coast, and suggested that a settlement there might be \\"worth the attention of some associated company, under the protection of the Government.\\"Ridley (2000), pp. 287‚Äì291 The letter was received by the State Department on October 24, 1793. Jefferson was already trying to organize an overland expedition, under Andr√© Michaux, to the Pacific coast. The Michaux expedition never came to be, but the plan eventually resulted in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jefferson's reaction to Kendrick's letter is unknown, but the timing was not good. France had declared war on Britain and Spain just as Kendrick was writing the letter. Joseph Barrell had told Kendrick that any lands purchased could be authorized by Congress after the fact. Although this was true, in early 1793 Congress was unwilling to provoke Britain and Spain by annexing land on the Pacific coast. Kendrick, unaware of these events and knowing that at best there would be a long delay in any response, prepared to sail to the Pacific Northwest. He loaded Washington with trade goods, including cases of muskets, barrels of gunpowder, and ammunition. He left China and sailed to Nootka Sound, arriving in May, 1793. Northwest Coast 1793 Kendrick sailed across the Pacific from Macau, reaching Nootka Sound in late May, 1793, just days after George Vancouver had left. Salvador Fidalgo was the new commandant of the Spanish outpost, taking over after Bodeya y Quadra returned to San Blas, Mexico.Ridley (2000), pp. 300‚Äì309 Unlike Quadra, Fidalgo deeply mistrusted the Nuu-chah- nulth and other Northwest natives, and his attitude and behavior toward them had quickly led to unrest, undoing the friendly relations that had been built by Quadra and Alejandro Malaspina. Some of the Nuu-chah-nulth chiefs wanted to attack and destroy the Spanish post. Fidalgo knew that Kendrick was allied with the natives and had probably brought more firearms for them. After anchoring in Friendly Cove Kendrick went ashore with John Howell as translator. Fidalgo told Kendrick that he was under orders to deny Washington entry at Nootka Sound. Kendrick responding by threatening to \\"raise the Indians and drive [the Spanish] from their settlement\\" if Fidalgo gave him any trouble. Shortly after this meeting Kendrick took Washington to his old outpost at Marvinas Bay a few miles to the north. There he found the 90 ton American schooner Resolution and was surprised and delighted to find his son, Solomon Kendrick, now 22 years old, was second mate. He was also pleased with the very warm welcome he received from Chief Maquinna and the local natives. Solomon Kendrick had sailed with his father when they first came to the Pacific Northwest but was with the Columbia when Gray first sailed to China in 1789. Solomon brought news from home and how things were going for John's wife Huldah, his other children, and various friends. John and Solomon shared their stories about their many adventures at sea. One of Solomon's tales involved a stop at the Valpara√≠so, Chile, where he met Don Blas Gonzales, who had been stripped of rank for having helped Kendrick in 1788. Gonzales had spent four years trying to regain his post and his reputation, to no avail. He gave Solomon a letter begging John Kendrick to intercede on his behalf. Kendrick immediately wrote to Thomas Jefferson, describing what had happened and requesting whatever assistance Jefferson could provide for Gonzales. Jefferson asked the American ambassador in Spain to advocate for Gonzales, but ultimately no restoration was granted. In late June, 1793, Solomon Kendrick sailed with Resolution to trade in Haida Gwaii. John Kendrick traded locally in Nootka Sound, then went to Clayoquot Sound briefly, where a dispute between his allies Maquinna and Wickaninnish was threatening to turn violent. Kendrick returned to Marvinas Bay on July 13, 1793. He made at least one more visit to Clayoquot Sound before departing for Hawaii in early October, 1793.Ridley (2000), pp. 315‚Äì322 Hawaii 1793‚Äì1794 Kendrick arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in late 1793. During the early winter he met with King Kamehameha on the Island of Hawaii. By January, 1794, he had given his carpenter John Boyd into the service of Kamehameha at Waiakea on Hilo Bay. Boyd began to work on building a ship for Kamehameha, planned to be a 40-ton, long armed sloop. As the work proceeded Kendrick toured the islands, trading and meeting the various men he had left. He had learned from Kamehameha that George Vancouver and William Brown had been trying to find a way to put the Hawaiian Islands under British control. Brown had already made a deal with Chief Kahekili that Brown believed gave him ownership of the islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai, and Oahu. Kendrick returned to Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii and began making plans to disrupt the plans of Vancouver and Brown. On January 9, 1794, Vancouver's ships Discovery, Chatham, and Daedalus passed Kealakekua Bay as they sailed to Waiakea to meet with Kamehameha. When Vancouver met with Kamehameha he learned about Kendrick's shipwright John Boyd and the ship being built. This caused Vancouver dismay, in part because he had refused when Kamehameha had asked him for a ship. Vancouver also learned that Kendrick was at Kealakua Bay, attended by Kamehameha's aide and advisor John Young. Vancouver, eager to obstruct Kendrick, asked Kamehameha to come with him to Kealakekua Bay. The king declined, citing the makahiki season and its taboos, as well as his need to host various ceremonial events. Vancouver felt he needed Kamehameha with him to effectively proscribe Kendrick. After much persuading and inveigling Kamehameha agreed and went with Vancouver. On the way Vancouver convinced Kamehameha to let him take over the ship construction that Boyd had begun. He dismissed Boyd's abilities and offered to move the frame to Kealakekua and have his own carpenters build the rest of the ship with Vancouver's own supplies. Vancouver declared that the ship, to be named Britannia, would be a \\"man-of-war\\". Nonetheless, Kamehameha was very pleased with the proposal. Vancouver's ships neared Kealakekua Bay on June 12, 1794. As they the crew worked to enter the bay John Young came with a letter of welcome from Kendrick's agent John Howell, who was living ashore under the protection of Keeaumoku PƒÅpaiahiahi, chief of the Kona district and one of Kamehameha's highest ministers. While Vancouver's ships lay becalmed outside the bay Young brought Kamehameha ashore. As the ships‚ÄîDiscovery, Chatham, and Daedalus‚Äîmade their way into the bay late in the day, Kendrick raised the US flag. As dusk turned to night Vancouver's ships anchored close to Washington. The 90 ton, long Washington was dwarfed by the 340 ton, long, Discovery, 135 ton, Chatham, and the massive store ship Daedalus. In addition, Vancouver's men, numbering over 180, far outnumbered Kendrick's crew of less than 30.Ridley (2000), pp. 322‚Äì326 The next day Kendrick, John Howell, and Keeaumoku PƒÅpaiahiahi went aboard Discovery. Vancouver and Kendrick met face-to-face for the first time. Vancouver and Howell had met at Nootka Sound when Howell was serving as translator for Bodega y Quadra. Kendrick told Vancouver he was wintering in Hawaii and planning to return to the Pacific Northwest coast in the spring. Howell would stay in Hawaii to manage Kendrick's business. Vancouver knew that Kendrick had already sailed among the islands, inspecting his operations in Kauai and Oahu, and was continuing to strengthen his ties and trade with the Hawaiians. Among the items he had acquired was the largest feathered war cloak, about long and wide. Reportedly, he had traded his two stern chaser cannons for the cloak. He had also obtained chunks of ambergris worth thousands of dollars. His men on Kauai were collecting sandalwood and pearls and were starting to produce molasses, a valuable trade good on the Northwest Coast. The next day Kendrick and Howell again dined on Discovery. Kendrick wanted to talk about William Brown and his Butterworth Squadron. He knew that Vancouver, as a royal naval officer, was under certain constraints, while Brown, a private merchant, was free to do as he pleased. On February 1, 1794, Vancouver's carpenters, having taken Boyd's ship frame, began working on the promised warship for Kamehameha. With Kamehameha increasingly pleased with him, Vancouver relaunched discussions about ceding Hawaii to Britain. Many chiefs met at a grand council on Discovery on February 19 and again on February 25. At the second council Kamehameha agreed to the cession of the island, according to Vancouver's journal. But when Vancouver required the removal of all of Kendrick's men, Kamehameha and the other chiefs refused, making the cession appear symbolic and hollow.Ridley (2000), pp. 326‚Äì333 Despite Vancouver's efforts, Kendrick was able to proceed as if nothing had happened. He ignored both Vancouver's claim over the Island of Hawaii and Brown's claim over the islands from Maui to Oahu. Vancouver left Kealakekua Bay on February 26, 1794, and briefly cruised among the Hawaiian Islands. He was finishing his survey of the islands and evaluation of harbors, as well as looking to strengthen British power and drive Kendrick away. Kendrick, however, sailed ahead, arriving at key harbors and meeting with chiefs before Vancouver. He spent five days at Waikiki (part of Honolulu today) with Kahekili and his chiefs. When Vancouver arrived the chiefs would not even meet with him. When Vancouver reached Kauai he found Kendrick at Waimea, having arrived two days before. Vancouver met with Kendrick and tried to pressure him into withdrawing his men. Kendrick dissembled and Vancouver thought he had succeeded. But when Vancouver finally left for the Pacific Northwest coast, on March 14, 1794, Kendrick and his men remained in the Hawaiian Islands. On February 24, 1794, Brown had set sail from China, making for the Pacific Northwest coast. Vancouver and Brown encountered each other on July 3, 1794, near Cross Sound, southeast Alaska. Brown had just arrived with the Jackall. Vancouver told him of his recent experiences in Hawaii, and his failure to seize or drive off the Americans, as Brown had been hoping.Ridley (2000), pp. 335‚Äì339 Not long after Vancouver left Hawaii, Kendrick also sailed to the Pacific Northwest coast. He found the situation at Nootka Sound bleak. Chief Maquinna's people had suffered a hard winter and famine. The conflict with Wickaninnish was ongoing. Maquinna wanted to move his people closer to the Spanish fort at Friendly Cove, but the new commandant, Ram√≥n Saavedra Guir√°ldez y Ord√≥nez, refused. Kendrick soon sailed north, seeking sea otter skins, which had become scarce at Nootka and Clayoquot. He cruised the Alexander Archipelago, acquiring furs. At the Tlingit settlement that would later become Sitka he disposed all his remaining trade goods, including some molasses his men had made in Kauai. Then he headed back to Nootka Sound. In early September, 1794, Kendrick was anchored in Friendly Cove, Nootka Sound, along with three Spanish ships and two British trading ships, including Prince Lee Boo, one of Brown's ships. Vancouver and his three ships soon arrived as well. He found his eldest son, John, now called Juan Kendrick, was there, having arrived as master of the Spanish frigate Aranzazu. He also learned that the Resolution had disappeared and his son Solomon was probably dead.Ridley (2000), pp. 339‚Äì344 Neither John nor his son Juan knew that Resolution had been attacked and captured by Chief Cumshewa and possibly Kendrick's old enemy Koyah. All but one of the crew were killed, including Solomon Kendrick. Juan Kendrick learned about this later and in 1799, with others who had lost friends or family members on Resolution, exacted revenge. At Friendly Cove Kendrick continued to prepared Washington for another voyage to China. It would be his fifth voyage across the Pacific Ocean. His situation seemed good. He had two seasons of furs in the hold, along with more than of ambergris from Oahu. The ambergris alone was worth about $16,000 in Macau. Awaiting him in Macau was a letter from Joseph Barrell offering Kendrick ownership of Washington, discharge from service to Barrell, and complete independence, if Kendrick could send 400 chests of tea, valued at about $14,000. But Kendrick would be killed before reaching Macau. In September, 1794, Juan Kendrick was given command of Aranzazu and sailed for San Blas. On the way he stopped at Monterey, California, thus becoming the first American known to have set foot in California. Being part of the Spanish Navy's San Blas Department, it was probably not his first time in California. On October 5, 1794, William Brown arrived on Jackall. He learned that he could no longer count on help from Vancouver, who with failing health was soon to return to England. On October 16, 1794, Vancouver left for Monterey. The next day the Spanish also left, abandoning their outpost at Nootka Sound, Santa Cruz de Nuca, as required by the Third Nootka Convention. Brown's Jackall and Prince Lee Boo soon left for Oahu, leaving only Lady Washington and the Spanish packet ship San Carlos. Around the end of October, 1794, Kendrick finally sailed for Hawaii. Hawaii and death Sloop Jackal, c. 1792.}} The story of Kendrick's return to Hawaii and his subsequent death has been told in many ways and has been the subject of much speculation and debate.Ridley \\"Morning of Fire\\"(2000), pp. 422 note 350 The earliest account comes from the log of Captain John Boit as told to him by John Young, just 10 months after the incident. Boit reported: \\"On the 3rd of December Capt John Kendrick in the snow Lady Washington of Boston arrived at Fairhaven and was met with a very friendly reception by Captain Brown. And on the 6th of the same month in consequence of a long quarrel between the Chiefs of Oahu and Kauai a battle was fought and victory was gained by the King of Oahu by the assistance of Kendrick who immediately informed Captain Brown that on the morrow he should cause the flag of the United States to be hoisted and fire a federal salute, which he begged might be answered by the two Englishmen, and it was accordingly agreed to, and Captain Brown ordered three guns to be unshotted for that purpose. And about ten the next morning the ship Jackal began to salute, but on coming to the third gun it was discovered not to be primed, so the apron of the 4th gun was taken off and fired, and being shotted with round and grapeshot it pierced the side of the Lady Washington and killed Captain Kendrick as he sat at his table, and killed and wounded many on deck.\\" James Rowan, the mate of Lady Washington at the time, would later say that \\"he had sworn since Captain Kendrick's death he would salute no vessel in a hurry, except at a safe distance.\\"Howay, F. W. The Ship Eliza in Hawaii 1799 Annual Report of Hawaiian Historical Society, 1934 Most narratives of Kendrick's death also refer to the account published by Sheldon Dibble, a missionary who worked in Hawaii from 1836 to 1845, because his sources included local oral traditions of the battle. According to Dibble: \\"Captain Brown interested himself in the war, but Captain Kendrick took no part in it. The first engagement was at Punahawale, where victory leaned to the side of Kaeo and several foreigners who aided Kalanikupule. The next engagement was at Kalauao in which it is said that Captain Brown with his men rendered efficient aid to Kalanikupule. In this engagement Kalanikupule was victorious and Kaeo was slain. On the return of the party to Honolulu, Captain Brown fired a salute in honor of Kalanikupule's victory. The American sloop was at anchor only a few yards distant, and Captain Kendrick was at dinner in the cabin. A wad, as is supposed, from one of the guns passed into the cabin and struck him in the head and killed him instantly. There was an investigation in the case held by foreigners on board one of the vessels and the decision was that the occurrence was a casualty.\\" Dibble, Sheldon,A History of the Sandwich Islands, 1909 pp. 54-55 It is believed that Kendrick's body was buried in the same location as those of Captain Derby in 1802 and Isaac Davis in 1810, in what would become the cemetery for foreigners near the corner of King St. and Pi'ikoi St. in Honolulu. Grave stones for Derby and Davis stood at this site until 1900, and it has been speculated that if the chiefs had designated a burial location for Kendrick and the other Lady Washington casualties it would have been used to bury other foreigners in the years to come. John Howell, the clerk onboard Lady Washington whom George Vancouver described as having \\"once been a clergyman of the Church of England\\" is presumed to have presided over Kendrick's burial service. The Rt. Rev. Henry B. Restarick, \\"The First Clergyman Resident in Hawaii\\", 32nd Annual Report of Hawaiian Historical Society, 1923 Nineteen days after Kendrick's death a group of Kalanik≈´pule's warriors attacked from canoes, killing Brown and many of his men. The survivors managed to escape to Kealakekua Bay with the ships. Ridley (2000), pp. 355‚Äì356 Whatever journals, logs, and other papers Kendrick had kept over the years were lost.Ridley (2000), pp. 356‚Äì360 Legacy With the loss of Kendrick's own journals and logs his story was pieced together from other sources, especially Haswell's journal and the miscellaneous papers of the financiers of the expedition. Howay, Frederic W. (1941). Voyages of the 'Columbia' to the Northwest Coast 1787-1790 and 1790-1793. Boston: Massachusetts Historical Society. Soon after his death Americans came to dominate the maritime fur trade that Kendrick had helped pioneer. Many of those who followed in his footsteps praised him, such as Amasa Delano and William F. Sturgis. Kendrick's harbor at Marvinas Bay, also known as Kendrick's Cove and Safe Harbor Retreat, became a common anchorage for American ships trading on the Northwest Coast.Ridley (2000), pp. 361‚Äì364 Kendrick Bay and Kendrick Islands, in southern Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, are named for John Kendrick. Several places in British Columbia are named for John Kendrick, including Kendrick Inlet in Nootka Sound, and Kendrick Point in Haida Gwaii. The Captain John Kendrick House is a full Cape Cod style house located on Route 28 in South Orleans. Built in the late 1700s, this is the oldest house in good condition in Orleans. The Kendrick Woods Conservation Area and John Kendrick Road also exist in the town of Orleans, Massachusetts. References Further reading    Boit, J., & Meany, E. (1921). New Log of the Columbia.

American publicist Georges Obolensky also called it the Gang of Eight. The coup ultimately failed, with the provisional government collapsing by 22 August 1991 and several of the conspirators being prosecuted by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. Members The eight members were: *Gennady Yanayev (1937‚Äì2010), Vice President *Valentin Pavlov (1937‚Äì2003), Premier *Boris Pugo (1937‚Äì1991), Interior Minister *Dmitry Yazov (1924‚Äì2020), Defense Minister and Marshal of the Soviet Union *Vladimir Kryuchkov (1924‚Äì2007), Chairman of the KGB *Oleg Baklanov (b. 1932), First Deputy Chairman of the Defense Council of the USSR *Vasily Starodubtsev (1931‚Äì2011), Chairman of the Peasants' Union of the USSR * (1926‚Äì2019), President of the Association of State Enterprises Pugo committed suicide via gunshot to avoid arrest, while the other seven members were arrested. Coup d'√©tat The 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt, occurring between 19‚Äì21 August 1991, was an attempt by the Gang of Eight to take control of the country from then President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. The Gang of Eight were hard-line members of the Communist Party (CPSU) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the new union treaty he had negotiated, which dispersed much of the central government's power to the republics. The coup collapsed after only two days, and although Gorbachev was restored as President, his authority was irreparably damaged and he became less influential outside of Moscow. The event destabilized the Soviet Union and many speculate that it played a role in both the demise of the CPSU and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After the coup failed, the seven living members of the Gang of Eight were arrested. Court trials On December 15, 1992, over a year after the attempted coup, the Prosecutor General sent the criminal case against the Gang of Eight to the Military Collegiate of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. Anatoliy Ukolov, a deputy chairman of the Collegiate, was charged with reviewing the case, and the hearing was scheduled for 26 January 1993. The defendants included the aforementioned seven living members of the group plus Oleg Shenin (1937‚Äì2009), Politburo and secretariat member; Anatoly Lukyanov (b. 1930), Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; and Valentin Varennikov (1923‚Äì2009), General of the Army, Deputy Minister of Defense, and Commander of Land Forces. The trials lasted more than ten months, from 14 April 1993 until 1 March 1994. They were open to the public and press; however, foreign press did not participate due to lack of space in the courtroom. A prosecution commission was assigned to the case by the Collegiate, consisting of nine people and headed by Denisov, a Deputy Prosecutor General. The defense attorneys, Genri Reznik (Shenin), Genrikh Padva, Yuriy Ivanov (Kryuchkov), and Dmitriy Shteinberg (Varennikov) were hired, but in total, there were seventeen defense attorneys. After various delay tactics staged by the defense, the trial began on 30 November 1993. The main prosecutors were Yazov, Kryuchkov, Shenin, and Varennikov. On 23 February 1994, the State Duma issued an amnesty to the defense, and on 1 March 1994, the case was closed with all ten defendants accepting amnesty. Varennikov requested amnesty on the condition that Mikhail Gorbachev would be the next to be prosecuted, as he accused Gorbachev of creating the recent political disorder. The court rejected his petition, and upon Varennikov sending his request to the Prosecutor General's office, it was rejected again. Ten days after the close, the Presidium of the Supreme Court revived the prosecution, ruling that procedural infringements regarding the amnesty had occurred. The Presidium arranged a new hearing and assigned a new judge, Viktor Aleksandrovich Yaskin. He conducted the case review using revised court procedures. Yaskin offered the defendants amnesty, and all but Varennikov accepted it. Varennikov was acquitted on the argument that he was following the orders of Minister of Defense. Kryuchkov, Yazov, Shenin, and Pavlov were named as the main conspirators. Further fate of GKChP members Pugo committed suicide, together with his wife. However, some sources speculate that he may have been murdered. Yazov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, a prison in northern Moscow. According to the magazine Vlast No. 41(85) of 14 October 1991, he contacted the President from jail with a recorded video message, in which he repented and called himself \\"an old fool\\". Yazov denies ever doing that, and he also accepted the amnesty offered by the Russians stating that he was not guilty. He was dismissed from military service by the Presidential Order, and at his discharge, was awarded a ceremonial weapon. He was also awarded an order of honor by the President of Russian Federation. Yazov later worked as a military adviser at the General Staff Academy. He died in 2020 in Moscow, after a prolonged illness. Varennikov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, refused to accept the offered amnesty, and was eventually found not guilty to the Russians. Prior to the formation of the Gang of Eight, Varennikov participated in the January Events, an attempt to capture the TV- station in Vilnius, Lithuania. According to Gorbachev's aide, Anatoly Chernyaev, Varennikov personally made the decision to use force against the Lithuanians, without discussion with the President. Varennikov was a people's deputy, starting in 1995 and until his death. In 2008, he publicly stated that the military force used during the 1991 coup attempt was intended for security purposes, including the protection of Yeltsin. Varennikov died in 2009 and was buried in Moscow. Baklanov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, and then accepted amnesty in 1994, stating that he was not guilty. He later worked as a director of Rosobshchemash. Yanayev spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina. He later became a chairman of the department of national history at the Russian International Academy of Tourism. Pavlov had been taken to a hospital during the coup with the diagnosis of hypertension, but on 29 August 1991, he was transferred to Matrosskaya Tishina. He accepted amnesty stating that he was not guilty, and later became the head of the Chasprombank. Pavlov resigned from the bank on 31 August 1995, and six months later the bank was left without license. Afterwards he was an adviser at Promstroibank, today known as Bank VTB. Pavlov died in 2003 after a series of heart attacks and was buried in Moscow. =Evaluations of Ukolov's interviews= According to Vzglyad, Anatoliy Ukolov, the original person charged with the prosecution of the Gang of Eight, blamed the occurrence of the 1991 coup attempt on Gorbachev, implying that the leader should not have taken a vacation at the time. However, in an interview with Komsomol Pravda, Ukolov also mentioned how the members of GKChP chose not to follow the letter of law, but rather to take the situation into their own hands.

The CMOS sensor has resolution of 1920x1440 for digital still pictures and captures video at 1440x1080 interlaced, which is the resolution defined for HDV 1080i. The camera may also use the extra pixels for digital image stabilization. The camcorder can also convert the captured HDV data to DV data for editing the video using non- linear editing systems which do not support HDV or for creating edits which are viewable on non-HDTV television sets. The HVR-A1 is the prosumer version of the HDR-HC1. It has more manual controls and XLR ports.  Unique features  = Expanded focus = Expanded focus lets the user magnify the image temporarily to obtain better manual focus. Expanded focus works in pause mode only; it is not possible to magnify the frame during recording. A similar feature, named Focus Assist, appeared on the Canon HV20, which was released two years after the HDR-HC1. Focus Assist on Canon camcorders also works only when recording is paused. = Spot meter and spot focus = Spot meter and Spot focus are possible thanks to a touch-sensitive LCD screen, employed on most modern Sony consumer camcorders. The user can touch the screen to specify a specific region of the image; the camcorder automatically adjusts focus or exposure according to distance to the object and to illumination of the selected spot. Depending on a scene, changing focus with Spot Focus can cause focus \\"breathing\\" or \\"hunting\\", when the subject goes in and out of focus several times before the image stabilizes. = Shot transition = Shot transition allows for a smooth automatic scene transition. In particular, it makes rack focus easy. Two sets of focus and zoom can be preset and stored in \\"Store-A\\" and \\"Store-B\\" memory slots. The settings can then be gradually applied from one to another within 4 seconds. The transition time is not adjustable. Presently, the HDR-HC1 is the only consumer camcorder that offers this feature. Newer Sony consumer models offer Spot Focus mode as a means for rack focus. Changing focus with Spot Focus is faster than with Shot Transition, but is not as reliable because the camera has to search for correct focus each time instead of switching to a stored value. = Cinema effect = Cinema effect produces the jerky look usually attributable to a motion picture film. In the world of professional Sony camcorders this effect is known as CineFrame shooting mode. When Cinema effect is turned on, important manual controls such as shutter speed and aperture are disabled. Implementation of Cinema effect depends on the television system (50 Hz or 60 Hz) used in the target market. The 50 Hz version of the camcorder, HDR-HC1E, throws away one field from the original interlaced video and doubles another, effectively halving both temporal and spatial resolution. The result can be treated as 25- frame/s progressive video because there is no motion between the two fields of one video frame. The modification for 60 Hz market records 24- frame/s (more precisely, 23.98- frame/s) video instead, using the process known as 2-3 pulldown. While this recording scheme is widely used in other camcorders that offer 24- frame/s shooting mode, the camera employs an unusual algorithm of generating progressive frames, and then converting them back into video fields. As Cinema effect is a synthetic method of achieving film-like motion on an interlaced camcorder, it does not improve vertical resolution or light sensitivity. On contrary, spatial resolution is reduced compared to native interlaced recording. The same or better film look effect can be achieved by shooting regular interlaced video and then converting it into pseudo-progressive format with computer software. Other consumer-grade camcorders are more suitable for film-style recording. In particular, the Canon HV20 and the Canon HV30 camcorders have progressive imaging sensors and are capable of shooting true progressive video preserving spatial resolution and having an added benefit of better light sensitivity compared to interlaced shooting modes.

Founded in 1998 as a retailer of yoga pants and other yoga wear, Lululemon has since expanded to sell its products internationally in 460 stores as well as online. The company has expanded to sell a variety of athletic wear, including performance shirts, shorts, and pants, as well as lifestyle apparel and yoga accessories.  History  The Lululemon Athletica store in Westport, Connecticut The Promenade (Toronto, Canada) lululemon was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, British Columbia,Rob Walker, July 21, 2009, New York Times, Marketing Pose, Retrieved , \\"...it‚Äôs no surprise that some yoga devotees have zeroed in on it as an annoying phony-baloney symbol.

Wilson created the name to have many L's so that it would sound western to Japanese buyers, who often have difficulty pronouncing the letter. The company's initial public offering was in July 2007, raising $327.6 million by selling 18.2 million shares. Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks, became chief executive officer in 2008. In 2013, the company made its third consecutive appearance on Fortune's Fastest-Growing Companies list. In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that the president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.

In 2019, lululemon announced an investment in Mirror, a fitness startup that sells an interactive mirror with a camera and speakers for at-home workouts. The companies planned to create new content for the device, starting with meditation classes. In June 2020, Lululemon announced a $500 million deal to purchase Mirror, capitalizing on a growing trend of people conducting virtual workouts at home instead of going to a gym due to the COVID-19 pandemic. = Management = From its founding through 2015, lululemon incorporated elements of Landmark Forum into its leadership and development training. According to a company source, seventy percent of managers are hired internally. Store managers are responsible for their store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.  Products  Lululemon sells athletic wear including tops, yoga pants, shorts, sweaters, jackets and undergarments, as well as hair accessories, bags, yoga mats and water bottles. Lululemon trademarked its original fabric, Luon, which included a higher-than-average amount of nylon microfiber, in 2005. Since then, the company has produced several different types of fabrics, including compression and moisture-wicking designs. In 2017, Lululemon and Athletic Propulsion Labs began selling women's and men's shoes in 23 stores across North America. In 2019, the company launched a luxury streetwear brand called Lab in a few of its stores. Lululemon maintains a research and development lab, \\"Whitespace\\", within its headquarters. It has around 50 employees including scientists and physiologists.  Marketing  Originally known for women's yoga apparel, by 2019 Lululemon had grown by acquiring more male customers, adapting its product and marketing strategies accordingly, and plans to increase awareness of the brand among men. The company has been stated to use \\"holistic guerrilla marketing\\", aiming to make customers feel that by wearing Lululemon clothing they are part of a larger community. Lululemon uses social media including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as one of its main methods of marketing the company and its products.  Controversies  = False advertising = In November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that the clothing, made from seaweed, provided \\"anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits\\" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between ordinary T-shirt cotton and Vitasea fabric. Lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada. = Product quality = In 2013, some customers complained that the clothing was of poor quality, with some items being \\"too sheer\\", having holes appear, and falling apart after a few uses.\\"What Lululemon's revealing pants say about yoga\\". Los Angeles Times. \\"It seems that Lululemon, the Vancouver-based company, had to recall some of its yoga pants because they are too sheer.

The resulting financial loss and damage to the brand led to the forced departure of the company's Chief Product Officer, Sheree Waterson, and of its CEO, Christine Day. Lululemon Athletica pop-up shop in Traverse City, Michigan = Founder's statements = Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements that have been widely derided as offensive. In a 2004 interview, Wilson mocked Japanese pronunciation of the company's name. In 2013 he said that the company did not make clothes for plus-size women because it was too costly. In an effort to explain away excessive pilling in the brand's clothing, he blamed some customers for wearing Lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes. In an interview for Bloomberg TV in 2013, he stated that some women's bodies were unsuitable for the brand's clothing. Time called the remarks \\"fat shaming\\".Eliana Dockterman, November 13, 2013, Time magazine, \\"What Lululemon Could Learn From Abercrombie About Fat Shaming: A co-founder of Lululemon said his yoga pants just aren‚Äôt built for 'some women's bodies.'

In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders stating that the company had \\"lost its way\\" and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings. Since then, Wilson has used his website \\"Elevate Lululemon\\" to criticize the brand and business. = Legal disputes = In 2012, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three of its design patents for yoga pants. The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert intellectual property protection in clothing through patent rights. The case was settled out of court the same year.

Born in Gary, Indiana, Barreiro was a sports columnist at the Star Tribune for 17 years after previously working for the Dallas Morning News . Barreiro left the Star Tribune in March 2004. Bumper to Bumper Dan is known as \\"The Big Ticket\\" on KFAN due to his high ratings. He is also known as \\"Hi-Fi\\" because he spends a large amount of his disposable income on stereo equipment. Producer of the show is Minnesota Golden Gophers football sideline reporter and Edina High School tennis star Justin Gaard. Barreiro began his career at KFAN in 1992 partnered on-air with Chad Hartman, who is the son of longtime Star Tribune columnist Sid Hartman. The duo was selected as the \\"Best Sports Talk Radio Hosts\\" in 2000 by local weekly City Pages. In 2001, the pair broke up, with Hartman hosting the show leading into Barreiro's. Hartman was let go due to Clear Channel budget cuts in 2009. On his own, Barreiro earned the title \\"Best Sports Talk Radio Host\\" from City Pages in 2005 and 2006. In 2005, Barreiro also began airing a show called Sunday Sermons that airs Sunday mornings. Justin Gaard also does a Sunday show called \\"Cake Show\\".Sunday Sermons on Fan on Demand Barreiro is known to work politics into his show and is known for his rants. On November 8, 2007, rumors were surfacing in local Twin Cities newspapers regarding a potential move down the dial for Barreiro to AM 1500 KSTP. However, Barreiro had been in contract talks with Clear Channel regarding a long term extension at KFAN, and he did acknowledge the situation by stating \\"We're letting the process play out, I'll just leave it at that.\\" Barrerio's offer from KSTP was finally matched by Clear Channel on November 28, and Dan decided to stay with KFAN for the long term. The Sunday Sermons program ended April 6, 2008; the following Saturday, April 12, Barreiro began a new two-hour Saturday morning show (10 a.m. to noon) on KTLK-FM 100.3. Barreiro's new show is \\"almost exclusively non- sports,\\" and is similar to the past Sunday morning show. Barreiro remains on KFAN weekday afternoons. After a brief run on KLTK Barreiro returned to Sunday Sermons in 2010. He is no longer on KLTK unless it is as a fill in for one of their regulars. More on Carl Gerbschmidt Carl Gerbschmidt is a fictional diehard Green Bay Packers fan who lives in Elk Mound, Wisconsin. He is notable for often guesting on the Bumper to Bumper show with Dan Barreiro which airs on Minnesota's KFAN 100.3 FM radio station. He was introduced on KFAN in August 2001 under the guise that a tornado had blown over his property and left the remains of a damaged building situated in a manner that looked like the goal line formation of the famous 1967 Ice Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys. Gerbschmidt was reportedly born as Starr crossed the goal line. He normally discusses professional football on the show, especially the Packers and the Minnesota Vikings. Gerbschmidt started a blog which can be read on Barreiro's page on KFAN's website but it has not been updated since 2010. An Eau Claire, Wisconsin newspaper contained an article with Gerbschmidt as its featured subject and questioned his very existence. Gerbschmidt used to run an Ice Bowl exhibit and a Packers wax museum (now closed) at his house in Elk Mound. Gerbschmidt is married to Mrs. Gerbschmidt, who works in biophysics. The Gerbschmidts also have a daughter who played strong safety and punter. Gerbschmidt's hobbies include drinking beer, clog dancing, Kool & the Gang memorabilia, and Star Trek. Gerbschmidt moved to the Milwaukee suburb of Oconomowoc where he worked for the Wisconsin DOT. Gerbschmidt lived in West Baraboo until 2012, but moved home to Elk Mound when he was promoted to Supervisor by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. He recently purchased Brett Favre's truck on EBay, and possibly out-bid himself while doing so. However, after Favre signed with the Vikings on August 18, 2009, Gerbschmidt claimed that he lit the truck on fire. That was part of a memorable rant with Barreiro on the day Favre signed with the Vikings in which Barreiro allegedly called Gerbschmidt, who was at a bar in Chippewa Falls with his brother Randy after leaving work early the morning that the Favre news broke. Admittedly drunk, Gerbschmidt spent nearly 10 minutes fuming, and at times nearly crying, over Favre's signing, saying he was sad \\"for the children of Wisconsin who worshiped him\\", and saying Favre \\"best watch himself\\" when he comes back to Wisconsin. Gerbschmidt is a fictional character. The voice of Carl Gerbschmidt has not been confirmed and Barreiro has never admitted he is fictional. Through 18 years he has never made a public appearance. Barreiro has mentioned on his show that he has frequently heard from listeners who believe ESPN football analyst Kevin Seifert, a frequent guest on the show, provides the voice of Gerbschmidt. Barreiro and Seifert attempted to put that rumor to rest by having Seiftert in studio talking to Gerbschmidt while he called in on the phone. According to Paul Lambert (Meatsauce) at the 2016 Minnesota State Fair, Carl Gerbschmidt is voiced by Chad Abbott, but Lambert has named over nine members of the KFAN staff as doing Carl's voice.

The artist never saw Joan.Alain-Gilles Minella (2012). Jeanne d'Arc pour les Nuls, First Gr√ºnd, Paris, (online French) There are a number of revisionist theories about Joan of Arc which contradict the established account of her life. These include the theory that she was in fact guilty of the heresy for which she was condemned; that bones and other alleged relics come from her; that she escaped death at the stake and lived out her life in secret. The following interpretations are sometimes advanced to the public but have not gained significant acceptance among academic historians. For avowedly fictional representations of Joan in art, literature, and popular culture see Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc.  Royal bastard  In 1819, Pierre Caze published La V√©rit√© sur Jeanne d'Arc, which argued that Joan of Arc was the illegitimate daughter of the Queen, Isabeau of Bavaria, and Duke Louis of Orl√©ans. According to Caze's reasoning, the queen hid their daughter in the countryside with the d'Arc family. When Joan of Arc met the future King Charles VII she would have given him a private sign that she was his half-sister. It has been theorized that the coat of arms he later granted her included a sword as a baton of bastardy. Although this would provide an explanation for how she gained the trust of Charles VII in early 1429, this hypothesis has too many other difficulties to be taken seriously. Foremost among them is that the duke of Orleans died on November 23, 1407. Isabeau of Bavaria delivered a son on November 10, 1407. The likelihood of conceiving a daughter in the interim is exceedingly small. Assuming Joan of Arc was born the following year, she would have been 23 years old at her trial in 1431. She estimated her own age at 19 and all but one of the 115 witnesses at the trial of rehabilitation concurred with that age. Furthermore, if the sword in Joan of Arc's coat of arms represented a baton of bastardy, then it would be unique in heraldry; it is inconsistent with the laws of heraldry that a sword party per pale (see \\"Coat of Arms of Jeanne d'Arc\\") be considered a sign of illegitimacy. It would also mean that Joan of Arc and several witnesses perjured themselves about her birth. In the words of Regine Pernoud and Marie-Veronique Clin, \\"Yet amateur historians still insist that all these people ‚Äì as well as Charles VII, the duke of Alen√ßon, Dunois, Bertrand de Poulengy ‚Äì carried out an intricate plot to disguise Joan's authentic royal parents. This thesis lacks credible documentation.\\"Pernoud and Clin, p. 222.  Survival  Several impostors claimed to be Joan of Arc after the execution date. The most successful was Jeanne (or Claude) des Armoises. Claude des Armoises married the knight Robert des Armoises and claimed to be Joan of Arc in 1436. She gained the support of Joan of Arc's brothers. She carried on the charade until 1440, gaining gifts and subsidies. One chronicle states, \\"In this year there came a young girl who said she was the Maid of France and played her role so well that many were duped by her, and especially the greatest nobles.\\" Claude finally confessed she was a fraud after Charles VII asked her to repeat the secret which the real Joan had revealed to him when they first met at Chinon in March 1429, which Claude could not do.Pernoud, Regine. \\"Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses\\" p. 246. Some modern authors attempt to revive this claim by asserting that some other victim was substituted for Joan of Arc at the stake. The likelihood of this is extremely thin, since the trial of nullification records sworn testimony from numerous witnesses who were present at the execution and confirmed her identity.Pernoud and Clin, pp. 234‚Äì35.Pernoud, Regine. Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses, pp. 228‚Äì34. Dr. Cobham Brewer wrote in his nineteenth century volume Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable: The revisionist theory described by Brewer has been criticized on a number of grounds, including the significant number of eyewitnesses to Joan's execution, as well as the fact that Claude des Armoises subsequently confessed before a number of witnesses on multiple occasions to being an impostor.St. Joan Center. Misconceptions Series: \\"Did Joan Survive as Claude des Armoises?\\" Graeme Donald argues that much of the story of Joan of Arc is a myth. He says there are no accounts or portraits of Joan of Arc's victories during her time period, nor is she mentioned as a commander of the French army by Chastellain. He also states that the most definitive work of her life was written by Jules Quicherat between 1841 and 1849, after he discovered a cache of documents relating to her trial. Donald argues that she was most likely not burned.Graeme, Donald (2009). Lies, damned lies, and history. pp. 99‚Äì103. Historians have contradicted this view by pointing out that there is a wealth of information about Joan of Arc's campaigns and life from her contemporaries, including eyewitness accounts of the battles which frequently mention Joan's presence.Among the books which present translations of extensive excerpts from the eyewitness accounts: Pernoud, Regine. \\"Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses\\", pp. 59‚Äì60, 70-71, 80‚Äì93, 113‚Äì19, 12‚Äì24, 130, 132‚Äì34, 138‚Äì39, 147‚Äì52. Many of these were written during the campaigns themselves, such as Guy de Laval's letter on 8 June 1429.Pernoud, Regine. \\"Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses\\", pp. 111‚Äì12. Witch In 1921, anthropologist Margaret Murray argued that Joan was correctly identified as a witch by the religious authorities who condemned her to death, but that what they called witchcraft was, in fact, a survival of the pagan \\"old religion\\" of pre-Christian Europe. She claimed that Joan and Gilles de Rais were leaders of a pagan witch-cult that was a rival to the Catholic church.Sheppard, Kathleen L. (2013). The Life of Margaret Alice Murray: A Woman's Work in Archaeology. New York: Lexington Books, p. 170 Joan was the \\"incarnate God\\" of a cult derived from the worship of the virgin huntress Diana.Karen Sullivan, The Interrogation of Joan of Arc. Contributors, University of Minnesota Press, 1999, p. 19. Murray claimed that this was still the religion of most of the common people and the reason Joan inspired the ordinary soldier: According to Murray, the destruction of Joan was orchestrated by the Catholic Church itself and was its first major victory against the surviving pagan cult: Murray's views have been dismissed by later scholars as pseudo-historical fantasy.Michael Bailey. \\"Witchcraft Historiography\\" (review) in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 81‚Äì85. One historian called her ideas \\"vapid balderdash\\".C. L'Estrange Ewen (1938) \\"Some Witchcraft Criticism: A Plea for the Blue Pencil\\". Her claims about Joan of Arc were dismissed by historians based on the extensive evidence of Joan's actual religious views, such as the letters she dictated in which she defines her faith in \\"King Jesus, King of Heaven and of all the earth, my rightful and sovereign Lord.\\"Pernoud, Regine; and Clin, Marie-Veronique. \\"Joan of Arc: Her Story\\", p. 67. and the many eyewitness accounts of her beliefs and behaviour.  Relics and sites  Joan of Arc dictated her letters. Three of the surviving ones are signed. The Joan of Arc museum at Chinon, France has a charred bone fragment reputed to belong to Joan of Arc. Its authenticity is unconfirmed and appears to be unlikely, given the circumstances of her death. Indeed, forensic analysis has indicated that the bone is actually from an Egyptian mummy. The English ordered her body burned to ashes and the ashes cast into the River Seine. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has a helmet in its Arms and Armor collection with a legendary attribution to Joan of Arc. The museum makes no claims that this legend is true, but notes that the helmet dates from the right time period. Several locations associated with Joan of Arc still exist, including the house where she was born, at Domr√©my-la-Pucelle. The site has been converted to a museum. The adjacent church has undergone extensive alterations since the fifteenth century but still contains a fourteenth-century statue of Saint Margaret, before which Joan of Arc probably prayed. By contrast, the royal castle at Chinon is now a ruin. Little more than the outer wall remains. One wall remains of the great hall where she met Charles VII.

The call letters stood for \\"Charles River Broadcasting extension,\\" the station being a sister and extension of 102.5 FM WCRB-FM in Boston, Massachusetts. Both the Springfield, Massachusetts and Boston, Massachusetts stations programmed a classical music radio format overseen by Charles River Broadcasting owner Theodore Jones. =Switch to rock as WAQY= In the mid-1970s, Owners Don Wilks and Mike Schwartz decided to put the first automated Rock and Roll station on the air. Their program direction, Jim Boldebook, was given the task of programming a Shafer automation system. WAQY broadcast top 40 music with song titles every third song and no on-the-air DJ. DJs went live starting in 1976. August 1981, WAQY switched to a Rock music format known as AOR. Now known simply by the station‚Äôs call letters WAQY, they played a mix of new rock music from the 1980s mixed with older rock artists of the '60s (The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix etc.) and 1970s (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, etc.) Artists played included then current and popular Arena rock favorites Blue √ñyster Cult, Journey, Foreigner and Fleetwood Mac as well as singer and songwriter artists from Tom Petty to Billy Joel. Hard rock and heavy metal acts like AC/DC, Van Halen and Rush were also core artists. In the mid-1980s, WAQY adopted its current moniker \\"Rock 102\\" playing up to five current rock songs an hour. By 1992, WAQY stopped playing current music and completed its evolution from an AOR to a classic rock format.

It is a simple reflectory reaction in response to stimuli indicative of danger, that initiates an escape motion of an animal. The escape response has been found to be processed in the telencephalon.The above diagram is a simplified version showing that a cockroach will not venture towards a dangerous stimuli. Due to the escape reflex, the cockroach will take an alternative route once it has sensed the said stimuli. Escape reflexes control the seemingly chaotic motion of a cockroach running out from under a foot when one tries to squash it. As the stimulus on the left side enters the ear, the signal is processed and inhibits the muscles on the same side as the stimulus. Muscles on the opposite side remaining working, which allows the creature to quickly pull away from the stimulus if it is threatening. This depiction is a simplified version and does not contain all accurate structures involved. In higher animals, examples of escape reflex include the withdrawal reflex (e.g. the withdrawal of a hand) in response to a pain stimulus. Sensory receptors in the stimulated body part send signals to the spinal cord along a sensory neuron. Within the spine, a reflex arc switches the signals straight back to the muscles of the arm (effectors) via an intermediate neuron (interneuron) and then a motor neuron; the muscle contracts. There often is an opposite response of the opposite limb. Because this occurs automatically and independently in the spinal cord, the brain only becomes aware of the response after it has taken place.  Crossed extensor reflex  The crossed extensor reflex is another escape reflex, but it's a type of withdrawal reflex. It is a contralateral reflex that allows for the affected limb to have the flexor muscles contract and the extensor muscles to relax while the unaffected limb has the flexor muscles relax and the extensor muscles to contract. For example, stepping on a piece of glass causes the affected leg to be lifted or withdrawn and the unaffected leg to carry the additional burden of weight and maintain postural support. In this example, the afferent nerve fibers are stimulated on the right foot. The nerve fibers travel up to the spinal cord where they cross the midline, go to the left side, and synapse on an interneuron. When the afferent nerve fibers synapse on the interneuron, they can either inhibit or excite an alpha motor neuron on the muscles on side contralateral to the stimulus.  Escape reflex arcs  Escape reflex arcs have a high survival value enabling organisms to take rapid action to avoid potential danger or physical damage. The effectiveness of escape reflexes can be lowered when an organism is experiencing high levels of fatigue and or stress. These factors cause delays or weakness in the reflex, and they can even develop into learned helplessness, which has been found in animals and Drosophila flies. The reflex can also be habituated as seen in the tail-flip escape reflex of crayfish. More recent studies have also indicated that, once this crayfish escape response is habituated, it can also be recovered. A similar long-term habituation of the C-start escape response has also been studied in the larvae of zebrafish. Various animals may have specialized escape reflex arcs.

History A small monastery was founded here by and named after Saint Alto, a wandering monk, in about 750. The vita of Alto, likely written by Otloh of St. Emmeram after 1056 and ostensibly based on oral knowledge (written lore having been lost through plunder), reports that the monastery was visited by Saint Boniface, who dedicated the church. Another 11th-century text notes that Boniface also dedicated the church in nearby Benediktbeuern Abbey. Sometime before 1000 the Welfs enlarged it and made it into a Benedictine abbey. Welf I, Duke of Bavaria resettled the monks in 1056 to the newly founded Weingarten Abbey in Altdorf (now also called Weingarten), while the nuns formerly resident at Altdorf moved to Altom√ºnster, where they lived until the monastery was dissolved in 1488 by Pope Innocent VIII. In 1496 by grant of Duke George the Rich the Bridgettines of Maihingen were permitted to establish a Bridgettine monastery at Altom√ºnster.

Foot drop is a gait abnormality in which the dropping of the forefoot happens due to weakness, irritation or damage to the common fibular nerve including the sciatic nerve, or paralysis of the muscles in the anterior portion of the lower leg. It is usually a symptom of a greater problem, not a disease in itself. Foot drop is characterized by inability or impaired ability to raise the toes or raise the foot from the ankle (dorsiflexion). Foot drop may be temporary or permanent, depending on the extent of muscle weakness or paralysis and it can occur in one or both feet. In walking, the raised leg is slightly bent at the knee to prevent the foot from dragging along the ground. Foot drop can be caused by nerve damage alone or by muscle or spinal cord trauma, abnormal anatomy, atoxins, or disease. Toxins include organophosphate compounds which have been used as pesticides and as chemical agents in warfare. The poison can lead to further damage to the body such as a neurodegenerative disorder called organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy. This disorder causes loss of function of the motor and sensory neural pathways. In this case, foot drop could be the result of paralysis due to neurological dysfunction. Diseases that can cause foot drop include trauma to the posterolateral neck of fibula, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis, Charcot Marie Tooth disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, Welander distal myopathy, and Friedreich's ataxia. It may also occur as a result of hip replacement surgery or knee ligament reconstruction surgery. Signs and symptoms Mild steppage gait after treatment for foot drop Foot drop is characterized by steppage gait. While walking, people suffering the condition drag their toes along the ground or bend their knees to lift their foot higher than usual to avoid the dragging. This serves to raise the foot high enough to prevent the toe from dragging and prevents the slapping. To accommodate the toe drop, the patient may use a characteristic tiptoe walk on the opposite leg, raising the thigh excessively, as if walking upstairs, while letting the toe drop. Other gaits such as a wide outward leg swing (to avoid lifting the thigh excessively or to turn corners in the opposite direction of the affected limb) may also indicate foot drop.http://www.painontopoffoottalk.com Patients with painful disorders of sensation (dysesthesia) of the soles of the feet may have a similar gait but do not have foot drop. Because of the extreme pain evoked by even the slightest pressure on the feet, the patient walks as if walking barefoot on hot sand. Human lower leg anatomy Pathophysiology The causes of foot drop, as for all causes of neurological lesions, should be approached using a localization-focused approach before etiologies are considered. Most of the time, foot drop is the result of neurological disorder; only rarely is the muscle diseased or nonfunctional. The source for the neurological impairment can be central (spinal cord or brain) or peripheral (nerves located connecting from the spinal cord to an end-site muscle or sensory receptor). Foot drop is rarely the result of a pathology involving the muscles or bones that make up the lower leg. The anterior tibialis is the muscle that picks up the foot. Although the anterior tibialis plays a major role in dorsiflexion, it is assisted by the fibularis tertius, extensor digitorum longus and the extensor hallucis longus. If the drop foot is caused by neurological disorder all of these muscles could be affected because they are all innervated by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve, which branches from the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve exits the lumbar plexus with its root arising from the fifth lumbar nerve space. Occasionally, spasticity in the muscles opposite the anterior tibialis, the gastrocnemius and soleus, exists in the presence of foot drop, making the pathology much more complex than foot drop. Isolated foot drop is usually a flaccid condition. There are gradations of weakness that can be seen with foot drop, as follows according to MRC: * 0 = complete paralysis, * 1 = flicker of contraction, * 2 = contraction with gravity eliminated alone, * 3 = contraction against gravity alone, * 4 = contraction against gravity and some resistance, and * 5 = contraction against powerful resistance (normal power). Foot drop is different from foot slap, which is the audible slapping of the foot to the floor with each step that occurs when the foot first hits the floor on each step, although they often are concurrent. Treated systematically, possible lesion sites causing foot drop include (going from peripheral to central): # Neuromuscular disease; # Peroneal nerve (common, i.e., frequent) --chemical, mechanical, disease; # Sciatic nerve--direct trauma, iatrogenic; # Lumbosacral plexus; # L5 nerve root (common, especially in association with pain in back radiating down leg); # Cauda equina syndrome, which is cause by impingement of the nerve roots within the spinal canal distal to the end of the spinal cord; # Spinal cord (rarely causes isolated foot drop) --poliomyelitis, tumor; # Brain (uncommon, but often overlooked) --stroke, TIA, tumor; # Genetic (as in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies); # Nonorganic causes, e.g. as part of a functional neurological symptom disorder. If the L5 nerve root is involved, the most common cause is a herniated disc. Other causes of foot drop are diabetes (due to generalized peripheral neuropathy), trauma, motor neuron disease (MND), adverse reaction to a drug or alcohol, and multiple sclerosis. =Gait cycle= Drop foot and foot drop are interchangeable terms that describe an abnormal neuromuscular disorder that affects the patient's ability to raise their foot at the ankle. Drop foot is further characterized by an inability to point the toes toward the body (dorsiflexion) or move the foot at the ankle inward or outward. Therefore, the normal gait cycle is affected by the drop foot syndrome. The normal gait cycle is as follows: *Swing phase (SW): The period of time when the foot is not in contact with the ground. In those cases where the foot never leaves the ground (foot drag), it can be defined as the phase when all portions of the foot are in forward motion. *Initial contact (IC): The point in the gait cycle when the foot initially makes contact with the ground; this represents the beginning of the stance phase. It is suggested that heel strike not be a term used in clinical gait analysis as in many circumstances initial contact is not made with the heel. Suggestion: Should use foot strike. *Terminal contact (TC): The point in the gait cycle when the foot leaves the ground: this represents the end of the stance phase or beginning of the swing phase. Also referred to as foot off. Toe-off should not be used in situations where the toe is not the last part of the foot to leave the ground. The drop foot gait cycle requires more exaggerated phases. *Drop foot SW: If the foot in motion happens to be the affected foot, there will be greater flexion at the knee to accommodate the inability to dorsiflex. This increase in knee flexion will cause a stair- climbing movement. *Drop foot IC: Initial contact of the foot that is in motion will not have normal heel-toe foot strike. Instead, the foot may either slap the ground or the entire foot may be planted on the ground all at once. *Drop foot TC: Terminal contact that is observed in patients that have drop foot is quite different. Since patients tend to have weakness in the affected foot, they may not have the ability to support their body weight. Often, a walker or cane will be used to assist in this aspect. Drop Foot is the inability to dorsiflex, evert, or invert the foot. So when looking at the Gait cycle, the part of the gait cycle that involves most dorsiflexion action would be Heel Contact of the foot at 10% of Gait Cycle, and the entire swing phase, or 60-100% of the Gait Cycle. This is also known as Gait Abnormalities. Diagnosis Initial diagnosis often is made during routine physical examination. Such diagnosis can be confirmed by a medical professional such as a physiatrist, neurologist, orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon. A person with foot drop will have difficulty walking on his or her heels because he will be unable to lift the front of the foot (balls and toes) off the ground. Therefore, a simple test of asking the patient to dorsiflex may determine diagnosis of the problem. This is measured on a 0-5 scale that observes mobility. The lowest point, 0, will determine complete paralysis and the highest point, 5, will determine complete mobility. There are other tests that may help determine the underlying etiology for this diagnosis. Such tests may include MRI, MRN, or EMG to assess the surrounding areas of damaged nerves and the damaged nerves themselves, respectively. The nerve that communicates to the muscles that lift the foot is the peroneal nerve. This nerve innervates the anterior muscles of the leg that are used during dorsi flexion of the ankle. The muscles that are used in plantar flexion are innervated by the tibial nerve and often develop tightness in the presence of foot drop. The muscles that keep the ankle from supination (as from an ankle sprain) are also innervated by the peroneal nerve, and it is not uncommon to find weakness in this area as well. Paraesthesia in the lower leg, particularly on the top of the foot and ankle, also can accompany foot drop, although it is not in all instances. A common yoga kneeling exercise, the Varjrasana has, under the name \\"yoga foot drop,\\" been linked to foot drop. Treatment AFO (Ankle Foot Orthosis) brace is a type of orthotic used to support the foot and ankle. The underlying disorder must be treated. For example, if a spinal disc herniation in the low back is impinging on the nerve that goes to the leg and causing symptoms of foot drop, then the herniated disc should be treated. If the foot drop is the result of a peripheral nerve injury, a window for recovery of 18 months to 2 years is often advised. If it is apparent that no recovery of nerve function takes place, surgical intervention to repair or graft the nerve can be considered, although results from this type of intervention are mixed. Non-surgical treatments for spinal stenosis include a suitable exercise program developed by a physical therapist, activity modification (avoiding activities that cause advanced symptoms of spinal stenosis), epidural injections, and anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or aspirin. If necessary, a decompression surgery that is minimally destructive of normal structures may be used to treat spinal stenosis. Non-surgical treatments for this condition are very similar to the non-surgical methods described above for spinal stenosis. Spinal fusion surgery may be required to treat this condition, with many patients improving their function and experiencing less pain. Nearly half of all vertebral fractures occur without any significant back pain. If pain medication, progressive activity, or a brace or support does not help with the fracture, two minimally invasive procedures - vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty - may be options. Dynamic advanced orthosis for drop foot Ankles can be stabilized by lightweight orthoses, available in molded plastics as well as softer materials that use elastic properties to prevent foot drop. Additionally, shoes can be fitted with traditional spring- loaded braces to prevent foot drop while walking. Regular exercise is usually prescribed. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a technique that uses electrical currents to activate nerves innervating extremities affected by paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), head injury, stroke and other neurological disorders. FES is primarily used to restore function in people with disabilities. It is sometimes referred to as Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) The latest treatments include stimulation of the peroneal nerve, which lifts the foot when you step. Many stroke and multiple sclerosis patients with foot drop have had success with it. Often, individuals with foot drop prefer to use a compensatory technique like steppage gait or hip hiking as opposed to a brace or splint. Treatment for some can be as easy as an underside \\"L\\" shaped foot-up ankle support (ankle-foot orthoses). Another method uses a cuff placed around the patient's ankle, and a topside spring and hook installed under the shoelaces. The hook connects to the ankle cuff and lifts the shoe up when the patient walks.

One thousand copies of each book were produced in 1992 signed by Zelazny with illustrations by Vaughn Bodƒì.Kovacs 2010, p. 119. Zelazny wrote Here There Be Dragons and Way Up High for his children in 1968-69. He admired the work of underground comics artist Vaughn Bodƒì and commissioned him to illustrate the two books. The drawings were exhibited at the 1969 World Science Fiction Convention in St. Louis, but before the books could be published Bodƒì informed Zelazny that although Zelazny owned the pictures he did not have the reproduction rights. Christopher S. Kovacs in his literary biography of Zelazny explains the issue: ‚ÄúZelazny saw the book as two of his tales illustrated by Bodƒì, but Bodƒì viewed it as a showcase of his art illuminated by Zelazny‚Äôs text.‚Äù The publication of the books foundered when Zelazny and Bodƒì insisted on equal royalties.

However, at the party he transforms himself into Belkis, a large, ferocious, flame-breathing dragon.  Plot synopsis  In an isolated kingdom, people do not travel abroad because the kingdom is surrounded by high mountains and because they think there are ferocious dragons beyond the mountains. They think there are dragons because the royal cartographer, Mr. Gibberling, does not know what is beyond the mountains so in the blank areas on the edges of his maps he writes \\"HERE THERE BE DRAGONS\\". The king wants fireworks for his daughter's birthday party, but the fireworks maker dies without passing on his skills to another. The king consults with his four advisers. The first adviser comes up with the idea of importing a medium-sized dragon with colored lights for the party. The king thinks this is a splendid idea and after some discussion the first three advisers assign the dragon hunting job to the fourth adviser, a young man named William. William goes on a quest to find such a dragon, but all he captures is a lizard named Bell. The lizard promises William that he will produce a medium-sized dragon with colored lights for the party. At the party, however, Bell transforms himself into a huge, menacing, fire-breathing dragon named Belkis. The dragon, it turns out, is interested in only one thing‚ÄîMr. Gibberling's practice of writing \\"HERE THERE BE DRAGONS\\" on his maps. He says that there are very few dragons, they wish to be left alone, and disguise themselves as innocuous animals such as lizards to avoid humans. He insists that Mr. Gibberling fly on his back and make accurate maps of the lands around the kingdom and eliminate all references to dragons. Mr. Gibberling then makes excellent maps of the whole region. But on one side of his maps is an enormous ocean with unknown lands beyond it. Since he does not know what is there he writes: \\"HERE THERE BE SEA SERPENTS\\".  Reception  Carolyn Cushman in Locus calls Here There Be Dragons ‚Äúa Thurberesque idea and [Zelazny] handles it quite well.‚Äù She goes on to write: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cute story, without intrusively obvious educational elements, and with just enough truth, wonder and silliness to catch the imagination of all ages.‚Äù She likes it ‚Äúfor its satiric wit and appeal across ages.‚ÄùCushman 1992, p. 31 Darrell Schweitzer in Aboriginal Science Fiction writes that Here There Be Dragons and its companion piece, Way Up High, ‚Äúare charming, and worthy of widespread circulation.‚ÄùSchweitzer 1993, p. 57  Notes   References   * Kovacs, Christopher S.

He married Suzette Hustead and became the father of a son and two daughters. Career and politics Kirby worked for Western Surety Company from 1977-92 as corporate secretary and senior claim counsel. He was a founding partner in South Dakota's largest venture capital firm, Bluestem Capital Company, which was established in 1992. After serving as Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota from 1993 to 1995, Kirby ran for the Republican nomination for Governor of South Dakota in 2002. 2002 South Dakota Gubernatorial Election He entered the race after John Thune declared he would not run, but lost the election to Mike Rounds. It was one of South Dakota's greatest political upsets. Until late in 2001, then-Congressman Thune was the front-runner for the nomination. When Thune passed on the race in order to challenge Senator Tim Johnson, state Attorney General Mark Barnett and Kirby quickly became candidates. Rounds declared his candidacy late, in December 2001 and was out-raised and outspent ten-to-one by each of his opponents. However, the contest between Kirby and Barnett soon became very negative and \\"dirty\\". Barnett attacked Kirby for not investing in companies based in South Dakota and for his involvement with Collagenesis, a company which removed skin from donated human cadavers and processed them for use. It became the subject of a massive scandal when it was revealed that the company was using the skins for much more lucrative cosmetic surgery like lip and penis enhancements while burn victims \\"lie waiting in hospitals as nurses scour the country for skin to cover their wounds, even though skin is in plentiful supply for plastic surgeons\\". Kirby invested in the company after the scandal broke and Barnett attacked him for it in television advertisements. However, the advertisements backfired because \\"the claims were so outlandish, that people thought for sure that they were exaggerated or completely fabricated.\\" As the two front-runners concentrated on attacking each other, Rounds insisted on running a positive campaign and was not attacked by his opponents. Rounds' positive image and extensive knowledge of state government won him many supporters who were alienated by the front-runners. On the day of the primary election, Rounds won a stunning victory, with 44.3% of the vote to Barnett's 29.5% and Kirby's 26.1%. =Other political aspirations= Kirby considered running for the U.S. Senate in 2008 but declined to do so.

A sequel, followed by several more books, have since been released, including The Search for the Red Dragon (January 2008), The Indigo King (October 2008), The Shadow Dragons (October 2009), The Dragon's Apprentice (October 2010), The Dragons of Winter (August 2012), and The First Dragon (November 2013). Plot synopsis John, Charles, and Jack are three Oxford scholars united by the death of Stellan Sigurdsson, John's mentor, who thereafter receive The Imaginarium Geographica, which records mythical and fictional locations. When pursued by the anthropophagous, plural Wendigo, they are rescued by Bert, with whom they travel aboard the ship Indigo Dragon (captained by Bert's daughter Aven), to Avalon, and then to Paralon, the capital of the Geographica's 'Archipelago of Dreams', where they discover this Archipelago in an interregnum and discover that its social order can be restored by a descendant of Arthur Pendragon. Desirous of obtaining the royal 'Ring of Power', and thus the kingship, is the 'Winter King' (Mordred). Upon a visit to shipbuilder 'Ordo Maas' (Deucalion), the protagonists learn that the Winter King is using Pandora's Box to create the wraithlike 'Shadow-Born', his principal servants, from the citizens of lands conquered by himself. Fearing that the Winter King may gain an advantage by possession of the Imaginarium Geographica, they visit its author, the Cartographer of Lost Places, in his refuge, the Keep of Time, where they discover that their servant 'Artus' is a descendant of Arthur. Knowing this, they challenge the Winter King to pitched battle, wherein the still-loyal Elves, Dwarves, and Centaurs etc. oppose Shadow-Born, Trolls, and Goblins while Charles and the badger 'Tummeler' close Pandora's Box in secret. On the battlefield, Jack accidentally causes the death of Captain Nemo, while John and Artus approach the 'Ring of Power' (a ring of standing stones resembling Stonehenge) to summon the Archipelago's dragons, who rout the enemy. Mordred is cast from the Edge of the World by the dragon Samaranth. Upon return to their own world, John, Jack, Charles, and Bert are identified as J.R.R Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and H.G. Wells. Characters A number of people referenced in the novel were members of the Inklings, a literary discussion group at the University of Oxford, England, that produced some famous novelists. *John (J.R.R. Tolkien) is an ex-soldier, but becomes the 'Caretaker Principia' of the Imaginarium Geographica after the former Caretaker Principa is killed. Initially unable to read the Geographica, he eventually becomes proficient in so doing, and thereafter guides the others. *Jack (C.S. Lewis) is the youngest of the three central characters, having not yet attended university (Oxford). Early on he demonstrates the most imagination of the three; but his recklessness briefly costs him his integrity, and Captain Nemo's life. Thereafter he restores to their former characters, all the lands conquered by antagonist Mordred. *Charles (Charles Williams) is editor of the Oxford Press. Contemptuous of lesser antagonist 'Magwich', but gradually befriended by the badger 'Tummeler'. *Bert (H.G. Wells) is former Caretaker of the Imaginarium Geographica, alongside Stellan Sigurdsson and J.M. Barrie, and identified with the protagonist of the historic Wells' novel The Time Machine. *Aven is the captain of the ship Indigo Dragon, on which the protagonists initially travel; the daughter of H.G. Wells by his character Weena. *Bug/Artus is a boy who stows away on the Indigo Dragon after release from the service of three Norns. A descendant of King Arthur, and thus the heir to the Archipelago. *The Winter King/Mordred/Captain Hook is the antagonist, desirous of conquering the Archipelago by control of its population's shadows, and eventually of the dragons that guard the Archipelago itself. He is defeated by the dragon Samaranth. *Magwich is Mordred's spy and assistant, and formerly an apprentice to Charles Dickens. He is constantly threatened and beaten by the protagonists, among whom he briefly travels. In the end of the first book he becomes a Green Knight to protect Avalon. *Tummeler is a talking badger who accompanies the protagonists‚Äîeventually to close Pandora's Box by the shield of Perseus (given him by Samaranth), and thus terminate Mordred's 'Shadow- Born'. *Ordo Maas combines the characters of Thoth, Noah, and Deucalion. To him are attributed the sentient Dragonships: the Indigo Dragon, the Violet Dragon, the Blue Dragon, the Orange Dragon, the Yellow Dragon, the White Dragon and the Red Dragon (a modified Argo). An advisor to the protagonists. *Samaranth is the first dragon. Like Ordo Maas, he gives the protagonists advice and (among other dragons) aids them in the final battle. Film In the intro to The Search of the Red Dragon it was announced that Warner Brothers purchased the rights to make Here, There Be Dragons into a feature film.

No catholic and no-one whose close relatives are catholic may be a member.\\" Northern Ireland The Orange State, Michael Farrell Although many Orange marches are without incident, marches through mainly Catholic and Irish nationalist neighbourhoods are controversial and have often led to violence. History William III (\\"William of Orange\\") King of England, Scotland and Ireland, Stadtholder of the Netherlands The Orange Institution commemorates the civil and religious privileges conferred on Protestants by William of Orange, the Dutch prince who became King of England, Scotland, and Ireland in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In particular, the Institution remembers the victories of William III and his forces in Ireland in the early 1690s, especially the Battle of the Boyne. =Formation and early years= Since the 1690s commemorations‚ÄîBritish state-sponsored and those held by the lower British classes‚Äîhad been held throughout Ireland celebrating key dates in the Williamite War such as the Battle of Aughrim, Battle of the Boyne, Siege of Derry and the second Siege of Limerick. These followed a tradition started in Elizabethan England of celebrating key events in the Protestant calendar. By the 1740s there were organisations holding parades in Dublin such as the Boyne Club and the Protestant Society, both seen as forerunners to the Orange Order. Armagh disturbances Throughout the 1780s, sectarian tension had been building in County Armagh, largely due to the relaxation of the Penal Laws. Here the number of Protestants and Catholics (in what was then Ireland's most populous county) were of roughly equal number, and competition between them to rent patches of land near markets was fierce. Drunken brawls between rival gangs had by 1786 become openly sectarian. These gangs eventually reorganised as the Protestant Peep o' Day Boys and the Catholic Defenders, with the next decade in County Armagh marked by fierce sectarian conflict between both groups, which escalated and spread into neighbouring counties. Battle of the Diamond In September 1795, at a crossroads known as \\"The Diamond\\" near Loughgall, Defenders and Protestant Peep o' Day Boys gathered to fight each other. This initial stand-off ended without battle when the priest that accompanied the Defenders persuaded them to seek a truce, after a group called the \\"Bleary Boys\\" came from County Down to reinforce the Peep o' Day Boys. When a contingent of Defenders from County Tyrone arrived on 21 September, however, they were \\"determined to fight\\". The Peep o' Day Boys quickly regrouped and opened fire on the Defenders. According to William Blacker, the battle was short and the Defenders suffered \\"not less than thirty\\" deaths. After the battle had ended, the Peep o' Days marched into Loughgall, and in the house of James Sloan they founded the Orange Order, which was to be a Protestant defence association made up of lodges. The principal pledge of these lodges was to defend \\"the King and his heirs so long as he or they support the Protestant Ascendancy\\". At the start the Orange Order was a \\"parallel organisation\\" to the Defenders in that it was a secret oath-bound society that used passwords and signs. One of the very few landed gentry that joined the Orange Order at the outset, William Blacker, was unhappy with some of the outcomes of the Battle of the Diamond. He says that a determination was expressed to \\"driving from this quarter of the county the entire of its Roman Catholic population\\", with notices posted warning them \\"to Hell or Connaught\\". Other people were warned by notices not to inform on local Orangemen or \\"I will Blow your Soul to the Low hils of Hell And Burn the House you are in\\". Within two months, 7,000 Catholics had been driven out of County Armagh. According to Lord Gosford, the governor of Armagh: A former Grand Master of the Order, also called William Blacker, and a former County Grand Master of Belfast, Robert Hugh Wallace have questioned this statement, saying whoever the Governor believed were the \\"lawless banditti\\", they could not have been Orangemen as there were no lodges in existence at the time of his speech.William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795‚Äì1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg 37 According to historian Jim Smyth: > Later apologists rather implausibly deny any connection between the > Peep-o'-Day Boys and the first Orangemen or, even less plausibly, between > the Orangemen and the mass wrecking of Catholic cottages in Armagh in the > months following 'the Diamond' ‚Äì all of them, however, acknowledge the > movement's lower-class origins.The Men of No Popery: The Origins of The > Orange Order, Jim Smyth, History Ireland Vol 3 No 3 Autumn 1995 The Order's three main founders were James Wilson (founder of the Orange Boys), Daniel Winter and James Sloan.\\"James Wilson and James Sloan, who along with 'Diamond' Dan Winter, issued the first Orange lodge warrants from Sloan's Loughgall inn, were masons.\\" The Men of no Popery, The Origins Of The Orange Order , by Jim Smyth, from History Ireland Vol 3 No 3 Autumn 1995 The first Orange lodge was established in nearby Dyan, and its first grandmaster was James Sloan of Loughgall.A New Dictionary of Irish History from 1800, D.J.

The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture. Wiley-Blackwell, 2001. Page 317. United Irishmen rebellion The Society of United Irishmen was formed by liberal Presbyterians and Anglicans in Belfast in 1791. It sought reform of the Irish Parliament, Catholic Emancipation and the repeal of the Penal Laws. By the time the Orange Order was formed, the United Irishmen had become a revolutionary group advocating an independent Irish republic that would \\"Unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter\\". United Irishmen activity was on the rise, and the government hoped to thwart it by backing the Orange Order from 1796 onward.The Cause of Ireland: From the United Irishmen to Partition, Liz Curtis, Beyond the Pale Publications, Belfast, 1994, pg.9 Irish nationalist historians Thomas A. Jackson and John Mitchel argued that the government's goal was to hinder the United Irishmen by fomenting sectarianism, thereby creating disunity and disorder under pretence of \\"passion for the Protestant religion\\".Thomas A Jackson, Ireland Her Own, page 142‚Äì3 Mitchel wrote that the government invented and spread \\"fearful rumours of intended massacres of all the Protestant people by the Catholics\\".Mitchel, John. History of Ireland, from the Treaty of Limerick to the Present Time: Vol I. 1869. Page 223. Historian Richard R Madden wrote that \\"efforts were made to infuse into the mind of the Protestant feelings of distrust to his Catholic fellow- countrymen\\". Thomas Knox, British military commander in Ulster, wrote in August 1796 that \\"As for the Orangemen, we have rather a difficult card to play ... we must to a certain degree uphold them, for with all their licentiousness, on them we must rely for the preservation of our lives and properties should critical times occur\\". The United Irishmen saw the Defenders as potential allies, and between 1794 and 1796 they formed a coalition.Welsh, Frank: The Four Nations: A History of the United Kingdom, page 230‚Äì1 The United Irishmen, despite seeing the Defenders as \\"ignorant and poverty- stricken houghers and rick-burners\\" would claim in 1798 that they were indebted to the Armagh disturbances as the Orangemen had scattered politicised Catholics throughout the country and encouraged Defender recruitment, creating a proto-army for the United Irishmen to utilise. The United Irishmen launched a rebellion in 1798. In Ulster, most of the United Irish commanders and many of the rebels were Protestant. Orangemen were recruited into the yeomanry to help fight the rebellion and \\"proved an invaluable addition to government forces\\". No attempt was made to disarm Orangemen outside the yeomanry because they were seen as by far the lesser threat. It was also claimed that if an attempt had been made then \\"the whole of Ulster would be as bad as Antrim and Down\\", where the United Irishmen rebellion was at its strongest. However, sectarian massacres by the Defenders in County Wexford \\"did much to dampen\\" the rebellion in Ulster. The Scullabogue Barn massacre saw over 100 non- combatant (mostly Protestant) men, women, and children imprisoned in a barn which was then set alight,Dunne, Tom; Rebellions: Memoir, Memory and 1798. The Lilliput Press, 2004. with the Catholic rebels ensuring none escaped, not even a child who it is claimed managed to break out only for a rebel to kill with his pike. In the trials that followed the massacres, evidence was recorded of anti-Orange sentiments being expressed by the rebels at Scullabogue. Partly as a result of this atrocity, the Orange Order quickly grew and large numbers of gentry with experience gained in the yeomanry came into the movement. The homeland and birthplace of the Defenders was mid-Ulster and here they failed to participate in the rebellion, having been cowed into submission and surrounded by their Protestant neighbours who had been armed by the government. The sectarian attacks on them were so severe that Grand Masters of the Orange Order convened to find ways of reducing them. According to Ruth Dudley Edwards and two former Grand Masters, Orangemen were among the first to contribute to repair funds for Catholic property damaged in the rebellion.Ruth Dudley Edwards: The Faithful Tribe, pages 236‚Äì237. Harper Collins, London, 2000.William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795‚Äì1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg 139‚Äì140 One major outcome of the United Irishmen rebellion was the 1800 Act of Union that merged the Irish Parliament with that of Westminster, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Many Catholics supported the Act, but the Orange Order saw it as a threat to the \\"Protestant constitution\\" and 36 lodges in counties Armagh and Monaghan alone passed declarations opposing the Union. =Suppression= Battle of Dolly's Brae\\" (1849) between Orangemen and Catholic Ribbonmen In the early nineteenth century, Orangemen were heavily involved in violent conflict with an Irish Catholic secret society called the Ribbonmen. One instance, publicised in a 7 October 1816 edition of the Boston Commercial Gazette, included the murder of a Catholic priest and several members of the congregation of Dumreilly parish in County Cavan on 25 May 1816. According to the article, \\"A number of Orangemen with arms rushed into the church and fired upon the congregation\\".Murder in Ireland. (7 October 1816 ). Boston Commercial Gazette, http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3410213113_a106a44149_o.jpg On 19 July 1823 the Unlawful Oaths Bill was passed, banning all oath-bound societies in Ireland. This included the Orange Order, which had to be dissolved and reconstituted. In 1825 a bill banning unlawful associations ‚Äì largely directed at Daniel O'Connell and his Catholic Association, compelled the Orangemen once more to dissolve their association. When Westminster finally granted Catholic Emancipation in 1829, Roman Catholics were free to take seats as MPs (and take up various other positions of influence and power from which they had been excluded) and play a part in framing the laws of the land. The likelihood of Irish Catholic members holding the balance of power in the Westminster Parliament further increased the alarm of Orangemen in Ireland, as O'Connell's 'Repeal' movement aimed to bring about the restoration of a separate Irish Parliament in Dublin, which would have a Catholic majority, thereby ending to the Protestant Ascendancy. From this moment on, the Orange Order re-emerged in a new and even more militant form.Tony Gray The Orange Order, Rodley Head London (1972), pp. 103‚Äì106 In 1836 the Order was accused of plotting to place Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Order, on the throne in place of Victoria when King William IV died; once the plot was revealed the House of Commons called upon the King to disband the Order.\\"The Cumberland Plot\\" New Zealand Tablet, Volume XXIX, Issue 5, 31 January 1901, Page 3 Under pressure from Joseph Hume, William Molesworth and Lord John Russell, the King indicated measures would have to be taken and the Duke of Cumberland was forced to dissolve the Orange lodges.Murphy, James H. Abject Loyalty: Nationalism and Monarchy in Ireland During the Reign of Queen Victoria The Catholic University of America Press (2001) p18 In 1845 the ban was again lifted, but the notorious Battle of Dolly's Brae between Orangemen and Ribbonmen in 1849 led to a ban on Orange marches which remained in place for several decades. This was eventually lifted after a campaign of disobedience led by William Johnston of Ballykilbeg. =Revival= By the late 19th century, the Order was in decline. However, its fortunes were revived in the 1880s after its embrace by the landlords in opposition to both the Irish Land League and later Home Rule. The Order was heavily involved in opposition to Gladstone's first Irish Home Rule Bill 1886, and was instrumental in the formation of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). Protestant opposition to Irish self-government under Roman Catholic influence was intense, especially in the Protestant-dominated province of Ulster. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the Order suffered a split when Thomas Sloan left the organisation to set up the Independent Orange Order. Sloan had been suspended after running against the official unionist candidate on a pro-Belfast Protestant Association platform in the 1902 Belfast South by-election. =Role in the partition of Ireland= Orange banner showing the signing of the Ulster Covenant In 1912 the Third Home Rule Bill was introduced in the British House of Commons. However, its introduction would be delayed until 1914. The Orange Order, along with the British Conservative Party and unionists in general, were inflexible in opposing the Bill. The Order helped to organise the 1912 Ulster Covenant ‚Äì a pledge to oppose Home Rule which was signed by up to 500,000 people. In 1911 some Orangemen began to arm themselves and train as militias. In 1913 the Ulster Unionist Council decided to bring these groups under central control, creating the Ulster Volunteer Force, an Ulster-wide militia dedicated to resisting Home Rule. There was a strong overlap between Orange Lodges and UVF units. A large shipment of rifles was imported from Germany to arm them in April 1914, in what became known as the Larne gun- running. However, the crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the World War I in August 1914, which caused the Home Rule Bill to be suspended for the duration of the war. Many Orangemen served in the war with the 36th (Ulster) Division, suffering heavy losses, and commemorations of their sacrifice are still an important element of Orange ceremonies. The Fourth Home Rule Act was passed as the Government of Ireland Act 1920; the six northeastern counties of Ulster became Northern Ireland and the other twenty-six counties became Southern Ireland. This self-governing entity within the United Kingdom was confirmed in its status under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, and in its borders by the Boundary Commission agreement of 1925. Southern Ireland became first the Irish Free State in 1922 and then in 1949 a Republic. =Since 1921= James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. The Orange Order had a central place in the new state of Northern Ireland. From 1921 to 1969, every Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was an Orangeman and member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP); all but three Cabinet Ministers were Orangemen; all but one unionist Senators were Orangemen; and 87 of the 95 MPs who did not become Cabinet Ministers were Orangemen.Harbinson, John. The Ulster Unionist Party, 1882‚Äì1973. Blackstaff Press, 1973. pp. 90‚Äì91 James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, maintained always that Ulster was in effect Protestant and the symbol of its ruling forces was the Orange Order. In 1932, Prime Minister Craig maintained that \\"ours is a Protestant government and I am an Orangeman\\". This was in response to a speech the year before by Eamonn de Valera in the Irish Free State claiming that Ireland was a \\"Catholic nation\\" in a debate about protests against Protestant woman Letitia Dunbar-Harrison being appointed as County Librarian in County Mayo. Two years later he stated: \\"I have always said that I am an Orangeman first and a politician and a member of this parliament afterwards ... All I boast is that we have a Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State\\".Ireland: A History from the Twelfth Century to the Present Day, Paul Johnson, HarperCollins Ltd; New (1981), , Pg.209, Unionism and Orangeism in Northern Ireland Since 1945: The Decline of the Loyal Family, Henry Patterson and Eric Kaufmann, Manchester University Press (2007), , Pg.28, Orange Parades: The Politics of Ritual, Tradition and Control, Dominic Bryan, Pluto Press, (2000), , Pg.66Northern Ireland House of Commons Official Report, Vol 34 col 1095. Sir James Craig, Unionist Party, then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, 24 April 1934. This speech is often misquoted as \\"A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People\\", or \\"A Protestant State for a Protestant People\\". At its peak in 1965, the Order's membership was around 70,000, which meant that roughly 1 in 5 adult Ulster Protestant males were members. Since 1965, it has lost a third of its membership, especially in Belfast and Derry. The Order's political influence suffered greatly after the unionist-controlled government of Northern Ireland was abolished in 1973. In 2012, it was stated that estimated membership of the Orange Order was around 34,000.\\"Orange Order has 34,000 members.\\" The Newsletter 15 September 2012 After the outbreak of \\"the Troubles\\" in 1969, the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland encouraged Orangemen to join the Northern Ireland security forces, especially the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). The response from Orangemen was strong. Over 300 Orangemen were killed during the conflict, the vast majority of them members of the security forces.\\"Memorial to honour the Orange victims\\" . Portadown Times. 27 April 2007. Retrieved 1 April 2011. Some Orangemen also joined loyalist paramilitary groups. During the conflict, the Order had a fractious relationship with loyalist paramilitary groups,Various Orange Order leaders have condemned Loyalist paramilitaries over the years. For example, see Belfast Telegraph, 12 July 1974, p.3 and 12 July 1976, p.9; Tyrone Constitution, 16 July 1976, p.1 and 14 July 1978, p.14. the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Independent Orange Order and the Free Presbyterian Church. The Order urged its members not to join these organisations, and it is only recently that some of these intra- unionist breaches have been healed. Drumcree dispute Drumcree Church near Portadown. The Drumcree dispute is perhaps the most well-known episode involving the Order since 1921. On the Sunday before 12 July each year, Orangemen in Portadown would traditionally march to-and-from Drumcree Church. Originally, most of the route was farmland, but is now the densely populated Catholic part of town. The residents have sought to re-route the march away from this area, seeing it as \\"triumphalist\\" and \\"supremacist\\".Mulholland, Peter. \\"Drumcree: A Struggle for Recognition\\". Irish Journal of Sociology, Vol. 9. 1999 and [https://www.scribd.com/doc/26105917/. There have been intermittent violent clashes during the march since the 19th century.Bryan, Fraser, Dunn. Political Rituals: Loyalist Parades in Portadown ‚Äì Part 3 ‚Äì Portadown and its Orange Tradition. CAIN The onset of the Troubles led to the dispute intensifying in the 1970s and 1980s. At this time, the most contentious part of the march was the outward leg along Obins Street. After serious violence two years in a row, the march was banned from Obins Street in 1986. The focus then shifted to the return leg along Garvaghy Road. Each July from 1995 to 2000, the dispute drew worldwide attention as it sparked protests and violence throughout Northern Ireland, prompted a massive police/army operation, and threatened to derail the peace process. The situation in Portadown was likened to a \\"war zone\\"\\"Parade fervour turns country lane into war zone\\". The Guardian. 3 July 1999. and a \\"siege\\".\\"Siege of Drumcree\\". BBC News. 5 July 1998. During this time, supporters of the Orangemen murdered at least six Catholic civilians. In 1995 and 1996, residents succeeded in stopping the march. This led to a standoff at Drumcree between the security forces and thousands of loyalists. Following a wave of loyalist violence, the march was allowed through. In 1997, security forces locked down the Catholic area and forced the march through, citing loyalist threats. This sparked widespread protests and violence by Irish nationalists. From 1998 onward the march was banned from Garvaghy RoadDaugherty Rasnic, Carol (2003). Northern Ireland: can Sean and John live in peace? Brandylane Publishers Inc, p. 54. and the Catholic area was sealed-off with large barricades. For a few years, there was an annual major standoff at Drumcree and widespread loyalist violence. Since 2001, things have been relatively calm, but the Order still campaigns for the right to march on Garvaghy Road.\\"Groundhog Day at Drumcree parade\\" . Portadown Times, 13 July 2013. Retrieved 10 February 2014. The dispute led to a short-lived boycott of businesses owned by Orangemen and their supporters elsewhere in the region. Membership rates Membership of the Order was historically lower in areas where Protestants are in the majority, and vice versa. In County Fermanagh, where the Catholic and Protestant populations are close to parity, membership in 1971 was three times as high as in the more Protestant counties of Antrim and Down, where it was just over 10% of adult Protestant males.http://www.sneps.net/wp- content/uploads/2011/09/1-Dominant-Ethnicity-demography-and-conflict_revision- Dec2010.pdf Other factors that are associated with high rates of membership are levels of unemployment that more closely match Catholic levels, and low levels of support for the Democratic Unionist Party among unionists. Beliefs and activities Orange Order poster depicting historical and religious symbols. =Protestantism= The basis of the modern Orange Order is the promotion and propagation of \\"biblical Protestantism\\" and the principles of the Reformation. As such the Order only accepts those who confess a belief in a Protestant religion. As well as Catholics, non-creedal and non-Trinitarian Christians are also banned. This includes members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Unitarians, and some branches of Quakers. Previous rules specifically forbade Roman Catholics and their close relatives from joining but the current rules use the wording \\"non-reformed faith\\" instead. Converts to Protestantism can join by appealing to Grand Lodge. Masonic influences James Wilson and James Sloan, who issued the warrants for the first Lodges of the Orange Order along with 'Diamond' Dan Winter, were Freemasons, and in the 19th century many Irish Republicans regarded the Orange Order as a front group established by Unionist Masons as a more violent and jingoist vehicle for the promotion of Unionism. Some anti-Masonic evangelical Christian groups have claimed that the Orange Order is still influenced by freemasonry. (An example) Many Masonic traditions survive, such as the organisation of the Order into lodges. The Order has a similar system of degrees through which new members advance. These degrees are interactive plays with references to the Bible. There is particular concern over the ritualism of higher degrees such as the Royal Arch Purple and the Royal Black Institutions. (\\"On top of these previous concerns, there has been a growing evangelical opposition to the highly degrading ritualistic practices of the Royal Arch Purple and the Royal Black Institutions within the Orange over this past number of years.\\") Sabbatarianism The Order considers important the Fourth Commandment, and that it forbids Christians to work, or engage in non-religious activity generally, on Sundays. When the Twelfth of July falls on a Sunday the parades traditionally held on that date are held the next day instead. In March 2002, the Order threatened \\"to take every action necessary, regardless of the consequences\\" to prevent the Ballymena Show being held on a Sunday. The County Antrim Agricultural Association complied with the Order's wishes. =Politics= The Orange Order is strongly linked to British unionism.Tonge, Johnathan. Northern Ireland. Polity, 2006. Pages 24, 171, 172, 173.David George Boyce, Robert Eccleshall, Vincent Geoghegan. Political Thought in Ireland Since The Seventeenth Century. Routledge, 1993. Page 203.Mitchel, Patrick. Evangelicalism and national identity in Ulster, 1921‚Äì1998. Oxford University Press, 2003. Page 136. This is a political ideology that supports the continued unity of the United Kingdom. Unionism is thus opposed to, for example, the unification of Ireland and Scottish independence. An Orange Hall in Ballinrees bedecked with Union Flags. An anti-Orange Order sign in Rasharkin. The Order, from its very inception, was an overtly political organisation.For the Cause of Liberty, Terry Golway, Touchstone, 2000, p.179; Ireland: A History, Robert Kee, Abacus, First published 1982 Revised edition published 2003, 2004 and 2005, p61; Ireland History of a Nation, David Ross, Geddes & Grosset, Scotland, First published 2002, Reprinted 2005 & 2006, p.195 In 1905, when the Ulster Unionist Council (UUC) was formed, the Orange Order was entitled to send delegates to its meetings. The UUC was the decision-making body of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). Between 1922 and 1972, the UUP was consistently the largest party in the Northern Ireland Parliament, and all Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland and the vast majority of senior UUP figures were members of the Order. Due to its close links with the UUP, the Orange Order was able to exert great influence. The Order was the force behind the UUP no-confidence votes in reformist Prime Ministers Terence O'Neill (1969), James Chichester-Clark (1969‚Äì71), and Brian Faulkner (1972‚Äì74). At the outbreak of The Troubles in 1969, the Order encouraged its members to join the Northern Ireland security forces. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) attracted the most seats in an election for the first time in 2003. DUP leader Ian Paisley had been clashing with the Order since 1951, when the Order banned members of Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church from acting as Orange chaplains and later, from the 1970s, when it openly endorsed the UUP against the DUP.; Recently, however, Orangemen have begun voting for the DUP in large numbers due to their opposition to the Good Friday Agreement. Relations between the DUP and Order have healed greatly since 2001, and there are now a number of high-profile Orangemen who are DUP MPs and strategists. In December 2009, the Orange Order held secret talks with Northern Ireland's two main unionist parties, the DUP and UUP. The main goal of these talks was to foster greater unity between the two parties, in the run-up to the May 2010 general election. Sinn F√©in's Alex Maskey said that the talks exposed the Order as a \\"very political organisation\\". Shortly after the election, Grand Master Robert Saulters called for a \\"single unionist party\\" to maintain the union. He said that the Order has members \\"who represent all the many shades of unionism\\" and warned, \\"we will continue to dilute the union if we fight and bicker among ourselves\\". In the October 2010 issue of The Orange Standard, Grand Master Robert Saulters referred to 'dissident' Irish republican paramilitaries as the \\"Roman Catholic IRA\\". SDLP MLA John Dallat asked Justice Minister David Ford to find if Saulters had broken the hate speech laws. He said: \\"Linking the Catholic community or indeed any community to terror groups is inciting weak-minded people to hatred, and surely history tells us what that has led to in the past\\". In a 2011 survey of 1,500 Orangemen throughout Northern Ireland, over 60% believed that \\"most Catholics are IRA sympathisers\\".\\"60% of Order view Catholics as 'IRA sympathisers'\\". BBC News. 22 November 2011. Retrieved 25 November 2011. In 2015, the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland made a submission to the Northern Ireland Department of Arts, Culture and Leisure opposing the introduction of an Irish Language Bill. In its submission, the Lodge stated that it respected \\"Irish as one of the indigenous languages of the British Isles\\". However, the Lodge argued an Irish Language Act would promote inequality because it would be \\"directed towards a section of the Roman Catholic community\\".Submission dated 19 March 2015 of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland and signed by Dr. David Hume, Director of Services of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland in respect of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure consultation paper entitled \\"Consultation on Proposals for an Irish Language Bill\\" Bangor on 12 July 2010. =Parades= Parades are a big part of the Order's activities. Most Orange lodges hold a yearly parade from their Orange hall to a local church. The denomination of the church is quite often rotated, depending on local demographics. The highlights of the Orange year are the parades leading up to the celebrations on the Twelfth of July. The Twelfth, however, remains in places a deeply divisive issue, not least because of the alleged triumphalism, anti-Catholicism and anti-Irish nationalism of the Orange Order.Drumcree: The Orange Order's Last stand, Chris Ryder and Vincent Kearney, Methuen, .; Through the Minefield, David McKittrick, Blackstaff Press, 1999, Belfast, . In recent years, most Orange parades have passed peacefully.; http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking- news/ireland/article2763784.ece All but a handful of the Orange Order parades, at so-called \\"interface areas\\" where the two communities live next to each other, are peaceful. The locations used for the annual Twelfth parades are located throughout the six counties of Northern Ireland with County Down having the most venues with thirty-three. Counties Armagh and Fermanagh having a smaller population both have twelve host venues.Material Conflicts-Parades and Visual Displays in Northern Ireland, Neil Jarman page 127 Some smaller villages such as Carrickmore, Cushendall, Rostrevor, Crossmaglen and Draperstown are not marched in at all and areas with a sizeable population like Coalisland and Dungiven have never been the host for a major Twelfth parade.Material Conflicts-Parades and Visual Displays in Northern Ireland, Neil Jarman page 128 The Grand Lodge of Ireland does not recognise the Parades Commission, which it sees as having been founded to target Protestant parades, as Protestants parade at ten times the rate of Catholics. Grand Lodge is, however, divided on the issue of working with the Parades Commission. 40% of Grand Lodge delegates oppose official policy while 60% are in favour. Most of those opposed to Grand Lodge policy are from areas facing parade restrictions like Portadown District, Bellaghy, Derry City and Lower Ormeau. In a 2011 survey of Orangemen throughout Northern Ireland, 58% said they should be allowed to march through Irish nationalist and Catholic areas with no restrictions; 20% said they should negotiate with residents first.\\"Order poll on Catholic 'IRA sympathy'\\" . UTV News. 22 November 2011. Retrieved 25 November 2011. =Orange halls= Rasharkin Orange hall daubed with republican graffiti. William Batt and completed in 1889, which has a protective cage. The equestrian statue on the roof by Harry Hems is the only one of King William III of Ireland, Scotland and England on any Orange hall in Ireland. Monthly meetings are held in Orange halls. Orange halls on both sides of the Irish border often function as community halls for Protestants and sometimes those of other faiths, although this was more common in the past. The halls often host community groups such as credit unions, local marching bands, Ulster- Scots and other cultural groups as well as religious missions and unionist political parties. Of the approximately 700 Orange halls in Ireland, 282 have been targeted by arsonists since the beginning of the Troubles in 1968. Paul Butler, a prominent member of Sinn F√©in, has said the arson is a \\"campaign against properties belonging to the Orange Order and other loyal institutions\\" by nationalists.Irish News, 18 December 2007, pg16 (letter from Paul Butler) On one occasion a member of Sinn F√©in's youth wing was hospitalised after falling off the roof of an Orange hall. In a number of cases halls have been badly damaged or completely destroyed by arson,http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2539736.ece while others have been damaged by paint bombings, graffiti and other vandalism.Belfast Newsletter 18 December 2007, p.1 The Order claims that there is considerable evidence of an organised campaign of sectarian vandalism by Irish republicans. Grand Secretary Drew Nelson claims that statistical analysis shows that this campaign began in the last years of the 1980s and continues to the present. =Historiography= One of the Orange Order's activities is teaching members and the general public about William of Orange and associated subjects. Both the Grand Lodge and various individual lodges have published numerous booklets about William and the Battle of the Boyne, often aiming to show that they have continued relevance, and sometimes comparing the actions of William's adversary James II with those of the Northern Ireland Office. Furthermore, historical articles are often published in the Order's monthly newspaper The Orange Standard (available in a print edition and also electronically) and the Twelfth souvenir booklet. While William is the most frequent subject, other topics have included the Battle of the Somme (particularly the 36th (Ulster) Division's role in it), Saint Patrick (who the Order argues was not Roman Catholic), and the Protestant Reformation. There are at least two Orange Lodges in Northern Ireland which they claim represent the heritage and religious ethos of Saint Patrick. The best known is the Cross of Saint Patrick LOL (Loyal Orange lodge) 688, instituted in 1968 for the purpose of (re)claiming Saint Patrick. The lodge has had several well-known members, including Rev Robert Bradford MP who was the lodge chaplain who himself was killed by the Provisional IRA, the late Ernest Baird. Today Nelson McCausland MLA and Gordon Lucy, Director of the Ulster Society are the more prominent members within the lodge membership. In the 1970s there was also a Belfast lodge called Oidhreacht √âireann (Ireland's Heritage) LOL 1303, which argued that the Irish language and Gaelic culture were not the exclusive property of Catholics or republicans.Andrew Boyd, 'The Orange Order, 1795‚Äì1995', History Today, September 1995, pp.22‚Äì3. William was supported by the Pope in his campaigns against James' backer Louis XIV of France,Tim Pat Coogan, 1916: The Easter Rising, Phoenix, 2001, , p. 14 and this fact is sometimes left out of Orange histories.For example M.W. Dewar, John Brown and S.E. Long, Orangeism: A New Historical Appreciation, Belfast, 1967, pp.43‚Äì6. Occasionally the Order and the more fundamentalist Independent Order publishes historical arguments based more on religion than on history. British Israelism, which claims that the British people are descended from the Israelites and that Queen Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of the Biblical King David, has from time to time been advanced in Orange publications.For example, Orange Standard, July 1984, p.8; Alan Campbell, Let the Orange Banners Speak, 3rd edn, 2001, section on 'The Secret of Britain's Greatness'. =War commemoration= Thiepval Memorial Lodge parade in remembrance of the Battle of the Somme. The Order has been prominent in commemorating Ulster's war dead, particularly Orangemen and particularly those who died in the Battle of the Somme (1916) during World War I. There are many parades on and around 1 July in commemoration of the Somme, although the war memorial aspect is more obvious in some parades than others. There are several memorial lodges, and a number of banners which depict the Battle of the Somme, war memorials, or other commemorative images. In the grounds of the Ulster Tower Thiepval, which commemorates the men of the Ulster Division who died in the Battle of the Somme, a smaller monument pays homage to the Orangemen who died in the war.Steven Moore, The Irish on the Somme: A Battlefield Guide to the Irish Regiments in the Great War and the Monuments to their Memory, Belfast, 2005, p.110 =Relationship with loyalist paramilitaries= Orangemen carrying a banner of killed UVF member and Orangeman Brian Robinson in 2003. The Orange Order has been criticised for associating with loyalist paramilitary groups such as the UVF and UDA, which are classified as terrorist organisations. However, it has publicly condemned terrorism and paramilitary violence. Some bands that appear at Orange marches openly display support for loyalist paramilitary groups, such as by carrying paramilitary flags or sporting paramilitary names and emblems. For example, prominent loyalist John Gregg was a member of Cloughfern Young Conquerors band,Ian S. Wood, Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 200 while Coleraine- based Freeman Memorial band was named after a UVF member who was killed by his own bomb.Martin McGuinness accuses unionists of bowing to 'extreme loyalist agenda' Belfast Telegraph It has also been claimed that paramilitary groups approach certain bands asking the band to carry a flag of their organisation with financial assistance sometimes offered for doing so.Orange Parades-The Politics of Ritual, Tradition and Control Dominic Byrne Pluto Press page 127 A number of prominent loyalist militants were members of the Orange Order at the same time.

However, his expulsion was blocked by 300 Orangemen at a special disciplinary hearing.Bruce, p.158Booker, pp. 96‚Äì97 His successor as Scottish UDA commander, James Hamilton, was also an Orangeman. Many Scottish Orangemen were also convicted for loyalist paramilitary activity, and some Orange meetings were used to raise funds for loyalist prisoners' welfare groups.Booker, p.226Wood, p.333 In 2006, three Liverpool Orangemen were jailed for possession of weapons and UVF membership.

Following a police raid on the hall, two Orangemen were convicted for possession of \\"documents likely to be of use to terrorists\\", an automatic rifle, and membership of the Orange Volunteers. Their Orange lodge refused to expel them. An Orangeman and DUP election candidate with links to the Real UFF in Antrim was jailed in 2013 for his part in a sectarian attack on a Polish family. He was expelled from the Order.\\"Former DUP candidate jailed for sectarian pipe-bomb attack\\" The Newsletter The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland has issued several statements condemning violence and paramilitarism. Answering accusations of paramilitary links by Sinn F√©in in 2011, an Orange spokesman said: \\"The Orange Order has consistently condemned all terrorist violence\\". In 2008, Armagh Orangemen condemned the flying of paramilitary flags. Denis Watson, the then secretary of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, has publicly called for anyone convicted of terrorist offences to be thrown out. Addressing a 12 July demonstration in 2000, Orangeman and Democratic Unionist politician Jeffrey Donaldson said \\"It is essential that the Orange Order does not allow the paramilitaries to infiltrate its parades or hijack legitimate protests as a means of flaunting their aggression and engaging in displays of naked intimidation ... The Orange Order stands for higher ideals than this and must at every opportunity condemn the illegal activities of the paramilitaries and of all those who engage in acts of violence\\".Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Grand Orange Lodge Eric Kaufmann, in his book The New Unionism, writes: \\"The Orange Order actually took a firm stand against violence and paramilitarism throughout the Troubles. This opposition was rooted in the large contingent of Protestant clergymen who are built into the power structure of the Order. Young Orangemen were urged to join the RUC (police) or UDR (local security forces) and to stay away from paramilitaries\\". Requirements for entry \\"An Orangeman should have a sincere love and veneration for his Heavenly Father, a humble and steadfast faith in Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, believing in Him as the only Mediator between God and man. He should cultivate truth and justice, brotherly kindness and charity, devotion and piety, concord and unity, and obedience to the laws; his deportment should be gentle and compassionate, kind and courteous; he should seek the society of the virtuous, and avoid that of the evil; he should honour and diligently study the Holy Scriptures, and make them the rule of his faith and practice; he should love, uphold, and defend the Protestant religion, and sincerely desire and endeavour to propagate its doctrines and precepts; he should strenuously oppose the fatal errors and doctrines of the Church of Rome and other Non-Reformed faiths, and scrupulously avoid countenancing (by his presence or otherwise) any act or ceremony of Roman Catholic or other non-Reformed Worship; he should, by all lawful means, resist the ascendancy, encroachments, and the extension of their power, ever abstaining from all uncharitable words, actions, or sentiments towards all those who do not practice the Reformed and Christian Faith; he should remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day, and attend the public worship of God, and diligently train up his offspring, and all under his control, in the fear of God, and in the Protestant faith; he should never take the name of God in vain, but abstain from all cursing and profane language, and use every opportunity of discouraging those, and all other sinful practices, in others; his conduct should be guided by wisdom and prudence, and marked by honesty, temperance, and sobriety, the glory of God and the welfare of man, the honour of his Sovereign, and the good of his country, should be the motives of his actions.\\" Most jurisdictions require both the spouse and parents of potential applicants to be Protestant, although the Grand Lodge can be appealed to make exceptions for converts. Members have been expelled for attending Roman Catholic religious ceremonies. In the period from 1964 to 2002, 11% of those expelled from the order were expelled for their presence at a Roman Catholic religious event such as a baptism, service or funeral.Eric Kaufmann, The Orange Order: A Contemporary Northern Irish History, Oxford, 2007, p.288. This is based on Reformed Christian theology, which teaches that the Roman Catholic Mass is idolatry, a view promulgated by Protestant Reformers such as Martin Luther.Evangelical Protestant Society, \\"Martin Luther on Popery\\", http://www.ulsterbulwark.org/ROMANISM(2623567).htm The Order takes as its basis the Open Bible and historical Reformed documents such as the Presbyterian Westminster Confession, Anglican 39 Articles and other Protestant creeds.Evangelical Protestant Society, April 2011, \\"Why Protestants must never attend the Papal Mass\\", http://www.ulsterbulwark.org/ULSTER-BULWARK- AprJune-2011(2625528).htm Baptist Confession of Faith 1689, http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bcof.htm#part30 All prospective members must affirm their Reformed Christian Faith prior to membership. The Laws and Constitutions of the Loyal Orange Institution of Scotland of 1986 state, \\"No ex-Roman Catholic will be admitted into the Institution unless he is a Communicant in a Protestant Church for a reasonable period.\\" Likewise, the \\"Constitution, Laws and Ordinances of the Loyal Orange Institution of Ireland\\" (1967) state, \\"No person who at any time has been a Roman Catholic ... shall be admitted into the Institution, except after permission given by a vote of seventy five per cent of the members present founded on testimonials of good character ...\\" In the 19th century, Rev. Mortimer O'Sullivan, a converted Roman Catholic, was a Grand Chaplain of the Orange Order in Ireland. In the 1950s, Scotland also had a former Roman Catholic as a Grand Chaplain, the Rev. William McDermott. Structure The Orange Institution in Ireland has the structure of a pyramid. At its base are about 1400 private lodges; every Orangeman belongs to a private lodge. Each private lodge sends six representatives to the district lodge, of which there are 126. Depending on size, each district lodge sends seven to thirteen representatives to the county lodge, of which there are 12. Each of these sends representatives to the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, which heads the Orange Order. The Grand Lodge of Ireland has 373 members. As a result, much of the real power in the Order resides in the Central Committee of the Grand Lodge, which is made up of three members from each of the six counties of Northern Ireland (Down, Antrim, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh) as well as the two other County Lodges in Northern Ireland, the City of Belfast Grand Lodge and the City of Londonderry Grand Orange Lodge, two each from the remaining Ulster counties (Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan), one from Leitrim, and 19 others. There are other committees of the Grand Lodge, including rules revision, finance, and education. Despite this hierarchy, private lodges are basically autonomous as long as they generally obey the rules of the Institution. Breaking these can lead to suspension of the lodge's warrant ‚Äì essentially the dissolution of the lodge ‚Äì by the Grand Lodge, but this rarely occurs. Private lodges may disobey policies laid down by senior lodges without consequence. For example, several lodges have failed to expel members convicted of murder despite a rule stating that anyone convicted of a serious crime should be expelled,Peter Taylor, Loyalists, London, 1999, pp.151‚Äì2. and Portadown lodges have negotiated with the Parades Commission in defiance of Grand Lodge policy that the Commission should not be acknowledged. Private lodges wishing to change Orange Order rules or policy can submit a resolution to their district lodge, which may submit it upwards until it eventually reaches the Grand Lodge. All Lodge meetings commence with the reading of the Bible and prayers that non- practising Protestants, Roman Catholics and people of other faiths and none, 'may become wise unto salvation' (which is direct quote from 2 Timothy 3:15 in the Bible).Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Resolutions 2011, http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/press/Orange- Standard/2011-Standard/1107-Julyl2011/article2.html Related organisations An Orangewoman marching in an Orange Order parade in Glasgow. =Association of Loyal Orangewomen of Ireland= A distinct women's organisation grew up out of the Orange Order. Called the Association of Loyal Orangewomen of Ireland,Ruth Dudley Edwards, The Faithful Tribe: An Intimate Portrait of the Loyal Institutions, London, 2000, p.190 this organisation was revived in December 1911 having been dormant since the late 1880s. They have risen in prominence in recent years, largely due to protests in Drumcree. The women's order is parallel to the male order, and participates in its parades as much as the males apart from 'all male' parades and 'all ladies' parades respectively. The contribution of women to the Orange Order is recognised in the song \\"Ladies Orange Lodges O!\\". =Independent Orange Institution= The Independent Orange Institution was formed in 1903 by Thomas Sloane, who opposed the main Order's domination by Unionist Party politicians and the upper classes. A dispute between unionist candidates in East Belfast who were both Orangemen, saw one being kicked out of the Order for embarrassing an Orange grandee who had apparently not voted against a nationalist motion. The Independent Order originally had radical tendencies, especially in the area of labour relations, but this soon faded. In the 1950s and 60s the Independents focused primarily on religious issues, especially the maintenance of Sunday as a holy day and separation of politics from religion. With the outbreak of the Troubles, Ian Paisley began regularly speaking at Independent meetings, although he was never a member. As a result, the Independent Institution has become associated with Paisley and the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and Democratic Unionist Party. Recently the relationship between the two Orange Institutions has improved, with joint church services being held. Some people believe that this will ultimately result in a healing of the split which led to the Independent Orange Institution breaking away from the mainstream Order. Like the main Order, the Independent Institution parades and holds meetings on the Twelfth of July. It is based mainly in north Antrim. =Royal Black Institution= The Royal Black Institution was formed out of the Orange Order two years after the founding of the parent body. Although it is a separate organisation, one of the requirements for membership in the Royal Black is membership of the Orange Order and to be no less than 17 years old. The membership is exclusively male and the Royal Black Chapter is generally considered to be more religious and respectable in its proceedings than the Orange Order. =Apprentice Boys of Derry= The Apprentice Boys of Derry exist for their acts during the siege of Derry from James II. Although they have no formal connection with the Orange Order, the two societies have overlapping membership. Throughout the world The Orange Order was brought to other parts of the English-speaking world by Ulster Protestant migrants and missionaries. Grand Lodges have been set up in Scotland, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and West Africa. However, the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland have always been the largest by far. The Imperial Grand Orange Council is made up of representatives from all of these various Grand Lodges. It has the power to arbitrate in disputes between Grand Lodges, and in internal disputes when invited. Famous Orangemen have included Dr Thomas Barnardo, who joined the Order in Dublin; Mackenzie Bowell, who was Grandmaster of the Orange Order of British North America before becoming the Prime Minister of Canada; William Massey, who was Prime Minister of New Zealand; Harry Ferguson, inventor of the Ferguson tractor; and Earl Alexander, the Second World War general. Mohawk chief Dr Oronhyatekha, an Oxford scholar, was also a member.http://roughian.tripod.com/index-29.html =Republic of Ireland= An Orange Hall in Monaghan The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland represents lodges in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, where Orangeism remains particularly strong in border counties such as Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan. Before the partition of Ireland the Order's headquarters were in Dublin, which at one stage had more than 300 private lodges. After partition the Order declined rapidly in the Republic of Ireland. Following partition parades continued to take place in counties Monaghan and Cavan but none have taken place since 1931. The last 12 July parade in Dublin took place in 1937. The last Orange parade in the Republic of Ireland is at Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, an event which has been largely free from trouble and controversy.An Orange day out in the Republic, 9 July 2001 It is held on the Saturday before the Twelfth as the day is not a holiday in the Republic of Ireland. There are still Orange lodges in nine counties of the Republic of Ireland ‚Äì counties Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Laois, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Wicklow, but most either do not parade or travel to other areas to do so. In February 2008 it was announced that the Orange Order was to be granted nearly ‚Ç¨250,000 from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The grant is intended to provide support for members in border areas and fund the repair of Orange halls, many of which have been subjected to vandalism. In July 2011 there were 45 Orange Lodges in the Republic. =Scotland= Orange parade in Glasgow (1 June 2003) The Scottish branch of the Orange Order is the largest outside Ireland. The vast majority of Scotland's lodges are found in the Lowlands, especially the west Central Lowlands (Glasgow, Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, Lanarkshire). Scotland's first Orange lodges were founded in 1798 by soldiers returning home from Ireland, where they had helped suppress an Irish republican rebellion.Booker, Ronnie Michael. Orange Alba: The Civil Religion of Loyalism in the Southwestern Lowlands of Scotland since 1798. University of Tennessee, 2010. p.33 The Scottish branch grew swiftly in the early 1800s, when there was an influx of working-class Ulster Protestant immigrants into the Scottish Lowlands. Many of these immigrants saw themselves as returning to the land of their forefathers (see Plantation of Ulster).Booker, p.34 As such, the Scottish branch has always had strong links with Northern Ireland, and tends to be largest wherever there are most descendants of Irish Protestants. In 1881, three- quarters of its lodge masters were born in Ireland and, when compared to Canada, the Scottish branch has been both smaller (no more than two percent of adult male Protestants in west central Scotland have ever been members) and had more of an Ulster link. Scottish Orangeism was associated with the Tory party. The Order's political influence crested between the World Wars, but was effectively nil thereafter as the Tory party began to move away from Protestant politics. After the onset of the Troubles, many Scottish Orangemen began giving support to loyalist militant groups in Northern Ireland,Booker, Ronnie Michael. Orange Alba: The Civil Religion of Loyalism in the Southwestern Lowlands of Scotland since 1798. University of Tennessee, 2010. p.87 such as the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Although the Grand Lodge publicly denounced paramilitary groups, many Scottish Orangemen were convicted of involvement in loyalist paramilitary activity,Booker, pp. 101‚Äì102 and Orange meetings were used to raise funds for loyalist prisoners' welfare groups.Booker, p.226Wood, Ian S. Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. p.333 The Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland has long been opposed to Scottish independence. In 2007, 12,000 Orangemen and women marched along Edinburgh's Royal Mile to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union. It registered as an official participant in the 2014 independence referendum\\"Scottish independence: Orange Lodge registers to campaign for a 'No' vote\\". BBC News. 25 June 2014. Retrieved 12 July 2014. and formed an anti-independence campaign group called British Together.British Together campaign In 2004 former Scottish Orangeman Adam Ingram, then Armed Forces Minister, sued George Galloway for stating in his book I'm Not the Only One that Ingram had \\"played the flute in a sectarian, anti-Catholic, Protestant-supremacist Orange Order band\\". The Lord Ordinary, Lord Kingarth, ruled that the phrase was 'fair comment' on the Orange Order and that Ingram had been a member, although he had not played the flute. =England= Hyde Park, London, June 2007 The Orange Order reached England in 1807, spread by soldiers returning to the Manchester area from service in Ireland. Since then, the English branch of the Order has generally supported the Conservative and Unionist Party.Tim Pat Coogan, 1916: The Easter Rising, Phoenix, 2001, , p.15 The Orange Order in England is strongest in Liverpool including Toxteth and Garston. Its presence in Liverpool dates to at least 1819, when the first parade was held to mark the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, on 12 July. The Order was an important component in the founding of the Liverpool Protestant Party in 1909, keeping an association until the party's demise in 1974. The Orange Order in Liverpool holds its annual Twelfth parade in Southport, a seaside town north of Liverpool. The Institution also holds a Junior parade there on Whit Monday. The Black Institution holds its Southport parade on the first Saturday in August. The parades in Southport have attracted controversy in recent times, with criticism of the disruption that results from the closure of main roads. Other parades are held in Liverpool on the Sunday prior to the Twelfth and on the Sunday after. These parades along with St George's day; Reformation Sunday and Remembrance Sunday go to and from church. Other parades are held by individual Districts of the Province, in all approximately 30 parades a year. One location is Petersfield in Hampshire, where the town square has an equestrian statue of King William III, as does Hull. = Wales = Cymru LOL 1922 was the only Orange lodge in Wales. A new Lodge in Cardiff opened on 17 March 2012, the first new Orange Lodge to be opened there for over 90 years. =Canada= An Orange parade in Toronto (1860s). Founded by Ogle Gowan, in Brockville Ontario, the Orange Order played an important role in the history of Canada, where it was established in 1830. Most early members were from Ireland, but later many English, Scots, Italians and other Protestant Europeans joined the Order, as well as Mohawk Native Americans. Four Canadian prime ministers were Orangemen. Toronto was the epicentre of Canadian Orangeism: most mayors were Orange until the 1950s, and Toronto Orangemen battled against Ottawa-driven initiatives like bilingualism and Catholic immigration. The Toronto lodge has held an annual Orange parade since 1821, claiming it to be the longest running consecutive parade on the North American continent. A third of the Ontario legislature was Orange in 1920, but in Newfoundland, the proportion has been as high as 50% at times. Indeed, between 1920 and 1960, 35% of adult male Protestant Newfoundlanders were Orangemen, as compared with just 20% in Northern Ireland and 5%‚Äì10% in Ontario in the same period. In addition to Newfoundland and Ontario, the Orange Order played an important role in the frontier regions of Quebec, including the Gatineau- Pontiac, Quebec region. The region's earliest Protestant settlement occurred when fifteen families from County Tipperary settled in the valley in Carleton County after 1818.Johanne Devlin Trew, Place, Culture and Community: The Irish Heritage of the Ottawa Valley, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars 2009): 64. These families spread across the valley, settling towns near Shawville, Quebec. Despite these early Protestant migrants, it was only during the early 1820s that a larger wave of Irish migrants, many of them Protestants, came to the Ottawa valley region.Johanne Devlin Trew, Place, Culture and Community: The Irish Heritage of the Ottawa Valley, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars 2009): 62. Orangism developed throughout the region's Protestant communities, including Bristol, Lachute- Brownsburg, Shawville and Quyon.Johanne Devlin Trew, Place, Culture and Community: The Irish Heritage of the Ottawa Valley, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars 2009): 106. After further Protestant settlement throughout the 1830s and 40s, the Pontiac region's Orange Lodges developed into the largest rural contingent of Orangism in the Province.Cecil Houston, and William Smyth, The Sash Canada Wore, a Historical Geography of the Orange Order in Canada, (University of Toronto Press 1980):53‚Äì54. The Orange Lodges were seen as community cultural centres, as they hosted numerous dances, events, parades, and even the teaching of step dancing. Orange Parades still occur in the Pontiac-Gatineau- Ottawa Valley area; however, not every community hosts a parade.Johanne Devlin Trew, Place, Culture and Community: The Irish Heritage of the Ottawa Valley, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars 2009): 110. Now one larger parade is hosted by a different town every year. =United States= A picture of the Orange Order headquarters in New York City during the 1871 riot. Participation in the Orange Institution was not as large in the United States as it was in Canada. In the early nineteenth century, the post-Revolutionary republican spirit of the new United States attracted exiled Protestant United Irishmen such as Wolfe Tone and others.Kerby A. Millar, Emigrants and Exiles, Oxford University Press, USA (1988), pg 186. Most Protestant Irish immigrants in the first several decades of the century were those who held to the republicanism of the 1790s, and who were unable to accept Orangeism. Loyalists and Orangemen made up a minority of Irish Protestant immigrants during this period.Kerby A. Millar, Emigrants and Exiles, Oxford University Press, USA (1988), pg 191. America offered a new beginning, and \\"... most descendents of the Ulster Presbyterians of the eighteenth century and even many new Protestant Irish immigrants turned their backs on all associations with Ireland and melted into the American Protestant mainstream.\\"Timothy Meagher, The Columbia Guide to Irish American History, Columbia University Press (2005), pgs 91‚Äì92. Most of the Irish loyalist emigration was bound for Upper Canada and the Maritime provinces, where Orange lodges were able to flourish under the British flag. By 1870, when there were about 930 Orange lodges in Ontario, there were only 43 in the entire eastern United States. The few American lodges were founded by newly arriving Protestant Irish immigrants in coastal cities such as Philadelphia and New York.Donald McRaild, Faith, Fraternity, and Fighting, Liverpool University Press (2005), pg. 298. The Institution maintained a home for sick and aged members.Preuss p.257 Qualifications for membership were restrictive, according to their \\"Declaration of Principles\\", and \\"no person who ever was or is a Roman Catholic, or who shall educate, or cause to be educated, his children or any children in his charge, in any Roman Catholic school, convent, nunnery or monastery, shall ever be admitted to membership.\\" Preuss p.256 These ventures were short-lived and of limited political and social impact, although there were specific instances of violence involving Orangemen between Catholic and Protestant Irish immigrants, such as the Orange Riots in New York City in 1824, 1870 and 1871. The first \\"Orange riot\\" on record was in 1824, in Abingdon, New York, resulting from a 12 July march. Several Orangemen were arrested and found guilty of inciting the riot. According to the State prosecutor in the court record, \\"the Orange celebration was until then unknown in the country\\". The immigrants involved were admonished: \\"In the United States the oppressed of all nations find an asylum, and all that is asked in return is that they become law-abiding citizens. Orangemen, Ribbonmen, and United Irishmen are alike unknown. They are all entitled to protection by the laws of the country.\\"\\"History of the Orange Riots in New York\\", New York Times (12 July 1871). The Orange riots of 1870 and 1871 killed nearly 70 people, and were fought out between Irish Protestant and Catholic immigrants. After this the activities of the Orange Order were banned for a time, the Order dissolved, and most members joined Masonic lodges. After 1871, there were no more riots between Irish Catholics and Protestants.Michael Gordon, The Orange Riots: Irish Political Violence in New York City, 1870 and 1871, Cornell University Press (1993), pg 221. In 1923 the Loyal Orange Institution of the United States of America had 32,862 members in 256 lodges. The office of the \\"Supreme Grand Secretary\\" was at 229 Rhode Island Avenue, Washington, D.C.. There was apparently a split in the group in the early 1920s.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; pp.256‚Äì7 There are currently two Orange Lodges in New York City, one in Manhattan and the other in the Bronx. The Ulster-Scots LOL 1690 was established in Torrance, California in 1998. It was the first new lodge to be instituted in the US for more than 20 years. The latest American Lodge, Heirs of Cromwell LOL 1599 was formed in 2011 in Naples, Florida. =Australia= Flag of the Grand Orange Lodge of Australia. The first Orange Institution Warrant (No. 1780) arrived in Australia with the ship . It was sewn in the tunic of Private Andrew Alexander of the 50th Regiment. The 50th was mainly Irish; many of its members were Orangemen belonging to the Regimental lodge and they had secretly decided to retain their lodge warrant when they had been ordered to surrender all military warrants, believing that the order would eventually be rescinded and that the warrant would be useful in Australia. There are five state Grand Lodges in Australia which sit under the warrant of the Grand Lodge of Australia, the overall governing body for the institution in Australia. =New Zealand= Former Orange hall in Auckland, New Zealand, now a church. New Zealand's first Orange lodge was founded in Auckland in 1842, only two years after the country became part of the British Empire, by James Carlton Hill of County Wicklow. The lodge initially had problems finding a place to meet, as several landlords were threatened by Irish Catholic immigrants for hosting it.Kevin Haddick-Flynn, Orangeism: The Making of a Tradition, Dublin, 1999, pp.395‚Äì6; Rory Sweetman, 'Towards a History of Orangeism in New Zealand', in Brad Patterson, ed., Ulster-New Zealand Migration and Cultural Transfers, Dublin, 2006, p.158 The arrival of large numbers of British troops to fight the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s provided a boost for New Zealand Orangeism, and in 1867 a North Island Grand Lodge was formed. A decade later a South Island Grand Lodge was formed, and the two merged in 1908.Sweetman, p.157. From the 1870s the Order was involved in local and general elections, although Rory Sweetman argues that 'the longed-for Protestant block vote ultimately proved unobtainable'.Sweetman, p.160. Processions seem to have been unusual before the late 1870s: the Auckland lodges did not march until 1877 and in most places Orangemen celebrated the Twelfth and 5 November with dinners and concerts. The emergence of Orange parades in New Zealand was probably due to a Catholic revival movement which took place around this time. Although some parades resulted in rioting, Sweetman argues that the Order and its right to march were broadly supported by most New Zealanders, although many felt uneasy about the emergence of sectarianism in the colony.Sweetman, pp.160‚Äì2. From 1912 to 1925 New Zealand's most famous Orangeman, William Massey, was Prime Minister. During World War I Massey co-led a coalition government with Irish Catholic Joseph Ward. Historian Geoffrey W. Rice maintains that William Massey's Orange sympathies were assumed rather than demonstrated.Rice in Brad Patterson, ed., Ulster-New Zealand migration and cultural transfers, p259. Flag of the Grand Orange Lodge of New Zealand. Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand argues that New Zealand Orangeism, along with other Protestant and anti-Catholic organisations, faded from the 1920s. The Order has certainly declined in visibility since that decade, although in 1994 it was still strong enough to host the Imperial Orange Council for its biennial meeting. However parades have ceased,Ruth Dudley Edwards, The Faithful Tribe: An Intimate Portrait of the Loyal Institutions, London, 2000, p.136. and most New Zealanders are probably unaware of the Order's existence in their country. The New Zealand Order is unusual in having mixed-gender lodges,Haddick-Flynn, p.396. and at one point had a female Grand Master. =West Africa= ;Ghana The Orange Order in Ghana was founded by Ulster-Scots missionaries some time during the early twentieth century, and is currently supported by the Institute of Ulster Scots Studies. Its rituals mirror those of the Orange Order in Ulster, though it does not place restrictions on membership for those who have Roman Catholic family members. The Orange Order in Ghana appears to be growing, largely based with the growing democracy there. ;Nigeria The first Orange Lodge in Nigeria was the Lagos Fine Blues LOL 801, which was first listed in 1907 in the returns of Woolwich District 64 to the Grand Orange Lodge of England, this District providing the traditional 'home' to overseas and military Lodges.http://lol584.webstarts.com/the_orange_order_in_ww1.html The Orange Order in WW1 - LOL 585 Altogether there were three male lodges and one female lodge. They all appear to have died out some time in the 1960s, due to political unrest. Conversely the Ghana lodges increased greatly in popularity with the return of democracy. ;Togo In 1915 John Amate Atayi, a member of the Lagos Fine Blues LOL 801 moved to Lome, Togo, for work. Here he founded the Lome Defenders of the Truth LOL 867, under warrant of the Grand Orange Lodge of England. In 1916 a second lodge, Paline Heroes LOL No 884 was constituted. 'Diamond Dan' As part of the re-branding of Orangeism to encourage younger people into a largely ageing membership, and as part of the planned rebranding of the July marches into an 'Orangefest', the 'superhero' Diamond Dan was created ‚Äì named after one of its founding members, 'Diamond' Dan Winter ‚Äì Diamond referring to the Institution's formation at the Diamond, Loughgall, in 1795. Initially unveiled with a competition for children to name their new mascot in November 2007 (it was nicknamed 'Sash Gordon' by several parts of the British media); at the official unveiling of the character's name in February 2008, Orange Order education officer David Scott said Diamond Dan was meant to represent the true values of the Order: \\"... the kind of person who offers his seat on a crowded bus to an elderly lady. He won't drop litter and he will be keen on recycling\\". There were plans for a range of Diamond Dan merchandise designed to appeal to children. There was however, uproar when it was revealed in the middle of the 'Marching Season' that Diamond Dan was a repaint of illustrator Dan Bailey's well-known \\"Super Guy\\" character (often used by British computer magazines), and taken without his permission, leading to the character being lampooned as \\"Bootleg Billy\\".

P.20-1910 Victoria and Albert Museum, London Plumbago drawings are graphite drawings from the 17th and 18th centuries. There was a group of artists whose work in plumbago is remarkable for their portraits drawn with finely pointed pieces of graphite and on vellum. Initially these works were often prepared as the basis of an engraving. As time went by they would be produced as works in their own right. Early artists in plumbago One of the earliest of this group of workers was Simon Van de Pass (1595‚Äì1647), and his pencil drawings were probably either for reproduction on silver tablets or counters or for engraved plates. The earlier miniature painters also drew in this manner, notably Nicholas Hilliard in preparing designs for jewels and seals, and Isaac Oliver and Peter Oliver in portraits. A few pencil portraits by Abraham Blooteling, the Dutch engraver, have been preserved, which appear to have been first sketches, from which plates were afterwards engraved. David Loggan (1635‚Äì1700), a pupil of Van de Pass, also left a few portraits, as a rule drawn on vellum and executed with dexterity. These works were not always prepared for engraving. There is one representing Charles II, set in a gold snuff box, which was given by the King to the Duchess of Portsmouth, and which went to the Duke of Richmond, and a similar portrait of Oliver Cromwell which was in the possession of Lord Verulam; and there are no engravings corresponding to these. Later works William Faithorne (1616‚Äì1691) derived much of his skill from the time he spent with Robert Nanteuil, whose style he followed. There are drawings by him in the Bodleian Library, at Welbeck Abbey and at Montagu House, and two fine portraits in the British Museum. Thomas Forster (c. 1695‚Äì1712) was one of the major draughtsmen in this form of portraiture, on vellum and on paper. His work was at Welbeck Abbey, in the Holburne Museum at Bath, in the Victoria and Albert Museum and elsewhere. Robert and George White, were English artists, father and son. The former (1645‚Äì1704) was a pupil of Loggan and a prolific engraver, and most of his drawings executed on vellum were for the purpose of engraving. George White (c. 1684‚Äì1732) was taught by his father, and finished some of his father's plates. Forster and the two Whites signed their drawings and dated them. By Robert White there are portraits of John Bunyan and Sir Matthew Hale in the British Museum, and his own portrait at Welbeck; and by him and his son there are other drawings, depicting Sir Godfrey Kneller, Archbishop Tenison and others. The two John Fabers, John Faber Senior (c.1660‚Äì1721) and John Faber Junior (1660‚Äì1721), were Dutch; they usually added drawn inscriptions, often found within circles around the portraits and occasionally extending to many lines below them. The son was the more significant artist, known for mezzotints. The portrait painter Jonathan Richardson (1665‚Äì1745) executed many drawings in pencil, examples of which can be seen in the British Museum. The Scot David Paton was working in 1670. Most of his drawings belonged to the Earl of Dysart and were at Ham House; examples of his portraiture were in the possession of the Daizell family. Paton was attached to the court of Charles II, when the king was in Scotland; at that time he drew his portrait of the King. There are drawings of the same character as his, the work of George Glover (d. 1618) and Thomas Cecill (fl. 1630), but they were evidently studies for engravings. A Swiss artist, Joseph Werner (b. 1637) drew in pencil, adopting brown paper as the material on which his best drawings were done, and in some cases heightening them with touches of white paint. Later miniature artists, including Nathaniel Hone, Grimaldi, Bernard Lens and John Downman, also drew in plumbago. Other exponents of this art were Thomas Worlidge (1700‚Äì1766), F. Steele (c. 1714), W. Robins (c. 1730), G. A. Wolffgang (1692‚Äì1775), George Vertue the engraver (1684‚Äì1756), Johann Zoffany (1733‚Äì1810), and the Swede, Charles Bancks (c. 1748).

Hearst Castle, Historic People. HearstCastle.org, (California State Parks). Retrieved 2014-04-14. Life and career She was the daughter of vaudevillian George Willson and Hannah Murray Willson. Following in their father's footsteps, Millicent and her older sister Anita performed at the Herald Square Theater on Broadway in 1897 as \\"bicycle girls\\" in Edward Rice's The Girl From Paris. Millicent caught the eye of the 34-year-old Hearst, and their first dates were chaperoned by her sister Anita. After a six-year courtship, the publisher and aspiring politician Hearst married 20-year-old Millicent Willson on April 28, 1903. Hearst, photographed by James E. Purdy around 1905 Hearst, sketched by Marguerite Martyn in 1908 Millicent gave birth to five sons: George Randolph Hearst, born on April 23, 1904; William Randolph Hearst, Jr., born on January 27, 1908; John Randolph Hearst, born in 1909; and the twins, Randolph Apperson Hearst and David Whitmire (n√© Elbert Willson) Hearst, born on December 2, 1915. Hearst's mother, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, was dismayed by Millicent‚Äôs humble origins, but warmed to her daughter-in-law with the birth of the grandchildren. She was a member of the New York State Commission for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915, and acted as chief official hostess at the New York Pavilion during the exposition.State of New York at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, California, 1915 (Albany, 1916; pg. 28) New York City Mayor John Hylan appointed her chairman of the Mayor‚Äôs Committee of Women on National Defense during World War I. The committee sponsored entertainments for servicemen, operated a canteen, encouraged enlistments, sponsored patriotic rallies, and provided staples such as coal, milk, and ice to the needy. Hearst also served on wartime committees to raise funds for the rebuilding of France and the relief of French orphans. In 1921, she founded the Free Milk Fund for Babies, which provided free milk to the poor of New York City for decades. She also hosted charitable fundraisers for a variety of causes, including crippled children, unemployed girls, the New York Women‚Äôs Trade League, the Democratic National Committee, the Evening Journal - New York Journal Christmas Fund, and the Village Welfare of Port Washington, New York. Eleanor Roosevelt joined Millicent Hearst at many of these charitable events during the Great Depression. The Hearsts remained married until his death in 1951, but were estranged beginning in 1926 when his liaison with Marion Davies became public. Millicent established a separate life and residence in New York City as a socialite and philanthropist, rarely visiting her husband at their estate in San Simeon, California, known as Hearst Castle. She was close to her five sons throughout her life and they generally sided with her. Millicent Willson Hearst died on December 5, 1974, more than two decades after the death of her husband, and was buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

It was founded in 1894 by Charles Robert Ashbee, an Arts-and-Crafts designer, architect and social reformerhttps://www.bloomsburydesignlibrary.com/person?docid=iid-bdl-1220, Charles Robert Ashbee and was motivated by a desire to record and preserve London's ancient monuments. The first volume was published in 1900, but the completion of the series remains far in the future. The London Survey Committee was initially a volunteer effort, but from 1910 published the surveys jointly with the London County Council (later the GLC). From 1952 the voluntary committee was disbanded, and all survey work was wholly council-run. Following the abolition of the GLC in 1986, responsibility for the survey was taken over by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME).Hobhouse, H. (1984) London Survey'd, RCHME. Since 2013 it has been administered by The Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London.Bartlett School of Architecture: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/research/survey-london The series borrows its title from John Stow's A Survay of London (first edition 1598; revised edition 1603). Scope The Survey consists of a series of volumes based mainly on the historical parish system. Each volume gives an account of the area, with sufficient general history to put the architecture in context, and then proceeds to describe the notable streets and individual buildings one by one. The accounts are exhaustive, reviewing all available primary sources in detail. The Survey devotes thousands of words to some buildings that receive the briefest of mentions in the Buildings of England series (itself a vast and detailed reference work by most standards). However the earlier volumes largely ignored buildings built after 1800. Due to the scale of the existing endeavour there are no current plans to extend the project to take in the whole of Greater London. As of 2020, 53 volumes in the main series have been published. Separately, 18 monographs on individual buildings have been published. Most of the volumes have not been updated since publication, but those published online (up to Vol. 47) have received a limited amount of updating. Since 2008 the Survey of London has been published by Yale University Press. With the publication of the volumes on Clerkenwell in 2008, colour photography was used for the first time, and the images incorporated in the text ‚Äì previously they had been grouped separately as plates. A further volume on Woolwich was published in 2012, and two on Battersea appeared in late 2013. Two volumes on the eastern part of Marylebone, south of Marylebone Road, were issued in late 2017. Work has begun on Whitechapel, the historically rich and complex area on the eastern fringe of the City of London. The British History Online digital library project of the Institute of Historical Research has published all volumes, sponsored by English Heritage. Volumes # Bromley-by-Bow ‚Äì C. R.

The first monograph predated the first Survey volume, and work on the subsequent publications was always outside the auspices of the LCC. The original sequence ended with the disbanding of the voluntary committee; the sixteenth volume represented work which had started under the committee's governance. Almost thirty years later, a further monograph (No. 17) was published, focusing on County Hall and written by Hermione Hobhouse (1991). It was intended as a tribute to the LCC/GLC which, until its abolition in 1986, had responsibility for the Survey. Nearly twenty years after that an eighteenth volume was issued, describing the Charterhouse in Smithfield and written by Philip Temple (2010). # Trinity Hospital, Mile End ‚Äì C. R.

KNAI is owned by the Farmworker Educational Radio Network, Inc. Its studios are located in Phoenix near Piestewa Peak and its transmitter is in South Phoenix near Broadway and 27th Avenue. KNAI operates by day with 940 watts non-directional and at 1,000 watts at night with a directional antenna. Its programming is also heard on two translator stations, K270BZ (101.9 FM) and K271CR (102.1 FM). 860 AM is a Canadian clear-channel frequency, on which CJBC in Toronto, Ontario is the dominant Class A station. History =KIFN and KVVA= On June 8, 1949, the Western Broadcasting Company received the construction permit to build a new radio station in Phoenix on 860 kHz. Construction work on KIFN's facilities in Riverside Park began in September, and an accelerated schedule allowed Arizona's first full- time Spanish-language radio station, KIFN signed on at midnight on Tuesday, November 22. KIFN initially broadcast with 250 watts but benefitted from an increase to 1,000 watts in 1952. From the time it signed on until the early 1980s, KIFN operated as a daytime-only station. (860 is a Canadian clear channel frequency, limiting the coverage of American stations operating at 860.) The partners in Western sold their interests to H. Walker Harrison in 1959. Harrison sold KIFN in 1966 to the Tichenor family, which owned a group of Spanish-language stations that ultimately became the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation. Mauricio M√©ndez, operating as Hispanic Communications Corporation, acquired KIFN in 1979. Citing the difficulty of getting authorization to go to 24-hour operation on 860 and facing competition from 24-hour station KPHX, M√©ndez sold KIFN in 1982 to Beta Communications, bringing it under common ownership with Apache Junction's KSTM-FM. Beta relaunched the station as KVVA (\\"Viva\\"), retaining its Spanish-language format. In 1987, Beta changed KSTM-FM, a rock station known as \\"The Storm\\", to KVVA-FM, a more contemporary Spanish-language station, to pair with KVVA AM; it was the first Spanish-language FM station for Phoenix since 99.9 KNNN had been sold in 1984 and flipped formats. Among the programs aired in this era was a simulcast of Channel 10 KTSP-TV's 10 p.m. news, which began in 1988. =As a sports station= In 1996, KVVA-AM-FM went bankrupt, and the two stations found different buyers at auction. All of the Spanish-language programming moved to KVVA-FM, which was bought by Z-Spanish Network, a predecessor to Entravision Communications Corporation. The AM frequency, however, was purchased by Pulitzer Broadcasting Company, which acquired it with intentions on moving play-by-play sports contracts from 620 KTAR (then a news/talk outlet) to 860. Pulitzer beat out MAC America Communications, owners of KTVK-TV and KESZ, for the frequency. On December 12, 1996, KVVA left AM, ending 47 straight years of Spanish-language radio on 860. Pulitzer relaunched the station with new call letters KMVP (for \\"most valuable player\\"). Eventually, fans and team owners found the KMVP nighttime signal too weak to cover the entire Phoenix metropolitan area for play-by-play coverage, and the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Diamondbacks moved back to KTAR with KMVP retaining broadcasts of the Phoenix Mercury and Arizona Rattlers games. Over time, KMVP added more national sports talk (including ESPN Radio) and less local programs. Along with KTAR, ownership passed from Pulitzer to Hearst-Argyle, then Emmis Communications, and then Bonneville International, a subsidiary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When KTAR became a full-time sports station in 2007, it simulcast the programs of KMVP. The simulcast of KTAR and KMVP ended on April 14, 2007. On August 27, KMVP converted to Spanish language religious programming from Radio Vida Abundante. It later became a gospel music station, under a time brokerage agreement. KMVP continued to air some sports programs. When Bonneville's two Phoenix sports stations, 98.7 KMVP-FM and 620 KTAR, were already committed to running other sporting events, KMVP aired the \\"overflow\\" games, such as Phoenix Coyotes play-by-play and Arizona State Sun Devils basketball. In 2016, Bonneville reassumed control of KMVP, and started simulcasting sister sports station KMVP-FM. =Sale to CCF= On March 9, 2017, Bonneville announced that it would sell KMVP to C√©sar Ch√°vez Foundation‚Äôs Farmworker Educational Radio Network, Inc. for $800,000; the foundation already owned KNAI (88.3 FM) in Phoenix. The sale was completed on May 15, 2017; concurrently, the call letters changed to KNAI while 88.3 became KNAI-FM. On May 15, 2017, 860 AM dropped the KMVP-FM simulcast and began simulcasting KNAI-FM's Regional Mexican format, including programming after KNAI-FM's handover to KPHF at 7:30 pm each night. In August, after remediating interference concerns, newly bought translator K270BZ, which prior to going dark had been relaying KKFR from South Mountain, re-emerged to be fed by KNAI. In October 2017, the \\"La Campesina\\" programming moved exclusively to 860 AM and 101.9 FM; 88.3 FM, which changed its call letters to KCCF-FM, then began carrying a loop directing listeners to KNAI. KCCF-FM was sold to VCY America in 2018.

Route description  View north along CR 585 at Royal Avenue in Linwood CR 585 begins at the former location of the Somers Point Circle in Somers Point, intersecting Route 52 and the southern terminus of CR 559. The route heads north-northeast on two-lane undivided Shore Road through residential and commercial areas, intersecting CR 635 and CR 665 before passing west of Shore Medical Center and coming to CR 620, which provides access to Route 152. CR 585 intersects with the eastern terminus of CR 559 Alternate at the point it crosses into Linwood. In Linwood, the road passes several homes as well as the Linwood Country Club. Continuing into Northfield, CR 585 reaches a junction with CR 563 and CR 662. Past this intersection, the road turns northeast and passes the Atlantic City Country Club and meets CR 615 and CR 644. Upon entering Pleasantville, the route becomes Main Street and passes a mix of homes and businesses as it reaches the US 40/US 322 junction. Following this, CR 585 crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Pleasantville Industrial Track line and CR 608 as it heads through commercial areas. The road passes over the Atlantic City Expressway as it enters a mix of homes and commercial establishments. The route crosses CR 646 before intersecting CR 663, at which point it enters Absecon. In Absecon, CR 585 becomes Shore Road again and passes residences, intersecting CR 631 and CR 630. Immediately after the intersection with the latter, the route passes under NJ Transit‚Äôs Atlantic City Line and reaches US 30. Here, CR 585 ends and Shore Road continues north as Route 157.  History  CR 585 once continued farther to the south, ending at Route 109 in Lower Township, Cape May County. From its current southern terminus, it followed Route 52 into Ocean City, where it then continued on 9th Street before heading south on CR 656\\\\. It then headed west onto CR 623 into Upper Township. The route then headed to the southwest on CR 631 and then onto CR 610 passing through the eastern part of Woodbine and entering Dennis Township. CR 585 then ran concurrent with Route 47 through South Dennis before heading to the south on CR 657\\\\. It headed into Middle Township and into Cape May Court House, where CR 657 currently continues to Stone Harbor. At this point, CR 585 headed south concurrent with US 9\\\\. It then headed east on Route 147 into North Wildwood, where it turned south on CR 621\\\\. It then shifted to Park Boulevard, which carried it south through Wildwood and into Wildwood Crest, where it rejoined CR 621\\\\. It then headed into Lower Township to its terminus at Route 109. A spur route, CR 585 Spur, existed, which is now CR 618. As part of improvements to Route 52, including the construction of a new causeway over the Great Egg Harbor Bay, the Somers Point Circle at the southern terminus of CR 585 was replaced with a traffic light in October 2010.

It participated in the NCAA's Division III as a hockey-only conference. The conference included only men's teams. History The league was founded in 1998 with six teams: Benedictine University, the University of Findlay, Lawrence University, Marian University, the Milwaukee School of Engineering, and Northland College. After one year in the conference, Benedictine dropped hockey, and Findlay moved to the Division I College Hockey America conference. The University of Minnesota Crookston joined in 1999. As a Division II school, Minnesota Crookston operated the hockey team with no scholarships like the other Division III members of the league. While they competed in the conference championship, they were ineligible for the NCAA Division III Tournament, but they were eligible for the Harris Cup. In 2007, in order to meet NCAA guidelines and receive an automatic bid for the Division III tournament, the NCHA mandated that all member programs be Division III by the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Minnesota‚ÄìCrookston continued to play in the conference for the next two years but after the '09 season the university dropped varsity hockey and were replaced by Lake Forest. Finlandia University joined the conference for the 2004‚Äì05 season. Before the 2007‚Äì08 season, the MCHA added Concordia University in Mequon, Wisconsin, and Adrian College in Adrian, Michigan. In the summer of 2012, the five hockey-playing schools in the University of Wisconsin System announced that they would leave the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association (NCHA) to begin playing hockey in their all-sports conference, the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. The move would have left only two men's teams in the NCHA, leading St. Norbert College and the College of St. Scholastica to join the MCHA. In April 2013, the NCHA and MCHA announced a merger, where the NCHA would absorb the MCHA's teams (of the MCHA's 10 schools, all seven who also sponsored women's hockey played in the NCHA). The men's and women's sides will retain separate administrative structures, as well as their automatic bids to the NCAA Tournament.

It forms a conurbation with the coastal town of De Panne, which in turn is part of the west Belgian coastal conurbation. Adinkerke railway station is also the western terminus of the Belgian coast tram line to De Panne; Nieuwpoort, Ostend and beyond. Near the city is Plopsaland, formerly Meli Park. The 'kerke' suffix is common in west Flanders as an area surrounding a church (similar to kirk in Scotland and North East England). The closest French towns are Ghyvelde and Bray-Dunes, which can be accessed via the E40 (A16) motorway, N39 (N1) main road, or N386 (D 60) minor road in addition to a canal. The roads names in brackets employ French nomenclature once crossing the border. There are regular NMBS trains to Brussels. Access by train to Dunkirk is via Gare de Lille Flandres which is in France. The line across the border is out of use. Dk' bus run buses from the station forecourt to Gare de Dunkerque. A campaign group called Trekhaak-73 is seeking to re-open the railway line. History Adinkerke Military Cemetery In the First World War, from June to November 1917 the Commonwealth XV Corps held the front from the Belgian coast to St. Georges . The 24th and 39th Casualty Clearing Stations were posted at Oosthoek (between Adinkerke and Veurne) from July to November, and the 1st Canadian Casualty Clearing Station was at Adinkerke for a short time in June and July.http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e061/e001509384.jpg During the Second World War, the British Expeditionary Force was involved in the later stages of the defence of Belgium following the German invasion in May 1940, and suffered many casualties in covering the withdrawal to Dunkirk. Commonwealth forces did not return until September 1944, but in the intervening years, many airmen were shot down or crashed in raids on strategic objectives in Belgium, or while returning from missions over Germany. Adinkerke Military Cemetery contains 365 burials (168 Commonwealth dead of the First World War, 55 from the Second World War, also 142 Czech, Slovak and German war graves). Further Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves can be found in the Adinkerke Churchyard Extension, which contains a Belgian military cemetery as well as 67 Commonwealth burials. Tobacco Belgium has lower taxes on tobacco than France or the UK; as Adinkerke is the closest Belgian town accessible to the French ferry ports, it attracts many French smokers and British booze cruisers every day to make the trip across the border to buy cheaper tobacco. Adinkerke has the unusual claim to fame of having the greatest number of tobacconists per capita of any area in Europe. Previously, tobacconists were open around the clock, which provided the advantage of offering other commercial and fuel services that would not normally be found in a town of such a small size. While this may have proved beneficial to travellers, local people were inconvenienced by the constant traffic, so the local mayor ordered the tobacco stores to close during the night. Due to the smuggling associated with reduced tobacco duty, it is not uncommon for the E40 to be closed at night at junction 1 and French and Belgian police to question drivers and passengers of vehicles on the N34 road over the motorway. A weak eurohttp://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/08/uk- markets-forex-sterling-poll-idUKBREA070YP20140108 combined with increasingly expensive tobacco prices has resulted in more and more UK shoppers to make the day trip to Adinkerke to stock up on cheap tobacco.

Scott was born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Her family moved to Berkeley, California when she was 4 years old. She attended the University of California, Berkeley where she studied mathematics and astronomy. There were few options for further study in astronomy, as the field was largely closed to women at the time, so she completed her graduate studies in mathematics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949, and received a permanent position in the Department of Mathematics at Berkeley in 1951. She wrote over 30 papers on astronomy and 30 on weather modification research analysis, incorporating and expanding the use of statistical analyses in these fields. She also used statistics to promote equal opportunities and equal pay for female academics. In 1957 Scott noted a bias in the observation of galaxy clusters. She noticed that for an observer to find a very distant cluster, it must contain brighter-than-normal galaxies and must also contain a large number of galaxies.

As WEB it was one of the first radio stations to have been established and licensed in the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area, and used the callsign WIL for most of 1925 to 2008. The Federal Communications Commission revoked the license for the station and its three co-owned stations in March 2020 after discovering that a convicted felon had effective control of the stations in their last years; despite the revocation, KZQZ and KQQZ continued to broadcast without a valid license into April 2020. History =Experimental broadcasts by The Benwood Company= Participants at a February 9, 1922 radio broadcast from The Benwood Company's second floor studio, made in cooperation with the St. Louis Star newspaper. KZQZ traces its founding to April 5, 1922, the date that radio station WEB was first licensed to The Benwood Company of St. Louis.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, May 1, 1922, page 5. Limited Commercial license, serial #604. This makes it one of four St. Louis radio stations awarded a license in the spring of 1922. In the year-and-a-half prior to WEB's first license, the Benwood Company and its owners had made several experimental broadcasts on an irregular schedule. The Benwood Company was a small electrical firm, specializing in radio, that was named after its co-founders, the company's president William E. Woods, and vice president Lester Arthur \\"Eddie\\" Benson. On election night November 2, 1920, the two men broadcast election results provided by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper, over a radiotelephone transmitter operated at Woods' home at 4312 De Tonty Street.\\"Wireless Phone Relays Returns of Post-Dispatch\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, November 3, 1920, page 3. (At least three other stations made election night broadcasts: the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company at East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under a Special Amateur authorization, 8ZZ (now KDKA), the Detroit News' \\"Detroit News Radiophone\\" station, operating under an amateur station authorization, 8MK (now WWJ),\\"Screen, Radio Give Returns\\", Detroit News, November 3, 1920, pages 1-2. and the Buffalo Evening News, over an amateur station operated by Charles C. Klinck, Jr.\\"'News' Wireless Service on Election Wins Praise\\", Buffalo Evening News, November 4, 1920, page 2.) Benson and Woods continued to work on developing radiotelephone equipment, and an early December 1920 newspaper article stated that they had successfully communicated with an automobile over a distance of 30 miles (48 kilometers). At the time, it was noted that \\"The wireless telephone will be the last word in luxury tourists\\", and it also could be installed on police department automobiles for emergency communication.\\"Wireless Telephone for Autos Perfected\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, December 3, 1920, page 16. The two also made a few additional experimental radio broadcasts, from a variety of sites and apparently under multiple station licenses, although details are limited.In the June 30, 1920 issue of Amateur Radio Stations of the United States, Benson is listed as holding a standard amateur license with the call sign 9KV, with Woods licensed as 9LC. In late 1920, Benson was upgraded to a Special Amateur license, with the call sign 9ZB. The June 30, 1921 issue of Amateur Radio Stations of the United States still has Woods as 9LC, with The Benwood Company now having its own standard amateur license, 9LA. These same two assignments also appear in the June 30, 1922 edition. On January 29, 1922 it was announced that Woods was preparing a radio concert for the upcoming Friday evening featuring the City Club Quartet, to be followed at noon on Saturday by an address by Beatrice Forbes Robertson on the \\"Causes and Cure of Labor Unrest\\".\\"Three Club Speakers on City Club Program this Week\\", St. Louis Star, January 29, 1922, page 8. The St. Louis Star began working in conjunction with The Benwood Company, a partnership that would expand over the next few years. The newspaper arranged for Benson and Woods to conduct a broadcast on February 9, 1922 from the Benwood building located at 1110 Olive Street, and following its successful completion the effort was hailed by the paper as \\"the first elaborate program given by wireless in this section of the United States\\".\\"Radio Association in St. Louis is Live Wire Organization\\", St. Louis Star, February 11, 1922, page 3. A second Star-promoted broadcast was made two weeks later, on February 23.\\"The Star's Next Radio Concert on Thursday\\", St. Louis Star, February 21, 1922, page 3. It was announced that a third concert would be held on March 16, 1922, transmitting on the standard amateur radio station wavelength of 200 meters (1500 kHz) from Benson's home at 4942 Wiesehan Avenue.\\"Wesley Barry on the Star's Radio Program Tonight\\", St. Louis Star, March 16, 1922, page 3. However, this broadcast was canceled shortly before it was scheduled to take place, when L. R. Schmidt, in charge of monitoring the federal government's ninth Radio Inspection district, notified the participants that he had begun strictly enforcing a rule, adopted effective December 1, 1921, that banned amateur radio stations from making broadcasts intended for the general public.\\"St. Louis Radio Amateurs Take Examination for U. S. License\\", St. Louis Star, March 17, 1922, page 15. =WEB= May 4, 1922 advertisement for The Benwood Company and its radio station, WEB. The December 1, 1921 regulations mandated that stations wishing to make broadcasts now had to hold a Limited Commercial license that explicitly authorized the broadcasts. The Benwood Company filed the necessary paperwork, and on April 5, 1922 was issued a broadcasting station license with the randomly assigned call letters of WEB. The authorization included permission to use both wavelengths that had been set aside by the government for broadcasting stations: 360 meters (833 kHz) for \\"entertainment\\" and 485 meters (619 kHz) for \\"market and weather news\\".\\"Date First Licensed\\", Federal Communications Commission \\"History Cards\\" for WIL. WEB was the fourth St. Louis radio station to receive a broadcasting license, preceded by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch's KSD (March 14, 1922, now KTRS), St. Louis University's WEW (March 23, 1922), and the Stix-Baer-Fuller department store's WCK (April 3, 1922, deleted November 30, 1928 as WSBF). At this time all broadcasters transmitted their entertainment programs on 360 meters, so the stations in a given area had to establish a time-sharing agreement specifying the time periods during which each would operate. A Benwood Company advertisement that appeared in early May listed WEB's schedule as 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday evenings.Benwood Company advertisement, St. Louis Star, May 4, 1922, page 10. In late April it was announced that WEB had installed a 300-watt transmitter ‚Äî a high power for the time ‚Äî consisting of six fifty-watt tubes.\\"1,000-Mile Set Installed by St. Louis Concern\\", St. Louis Star, April 23, 1922, page 2. =WIL= 1933 station advertisement.WIL Advertisement Broadcasting, April 15, 1933, page 5. In November 1924, ownership of WEB was transferred to the Benson Radio Company, and in January 1925 the station's call sign was changed to WIL.\\"Additions and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 2, 1925, page 9. Shortly thereafter primary responsibility for the station's operations was taken over by the Star. A new studio was built on the eighth floor of the Star building, and the station licensee was changed to \\"St. Louis Star and the Benson Co.\\" After a short series of tests, the newspaper announced that regular programming from the new studio would start on January 31, and the station's schedule would be 10p.m. to midnight on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, and 9p.m. to 11p.m. on Friday. WIL was now broadcasting on 1100 kHz, a frequency it shared with WCK.\\"Tune in on The Star, WIL, Saturday Night\\", St. Louis Star, January 29, 1925, page 1. This arrangement lasted until early 1927, when the Benson Radio Broadcasting Company resumed as the sole operator, and the station's studios were moved to the Missouri Hotel Building.\\"First Radio Broadcast Here 8 Years Ago to be Repeated on Anniversary\\", St. Louis Star, February 3, 1930, page 8. There were numerous frequency shifts during the WIL's early history, until, in mid-1929, the station was assigned to part-time operation on a low-powered \\"local\\" frequency, 1200 kHz. It initially shared this frequency with two other St. Louis stations, WMAY and KFWF, but after both of these stations were deleted in the early 1930s WIL was able to operate fulltime.History of WIL (route56.com) A station advertisement in a 1933 issue of Broadcasting magazine claimed a number of \\"firsts\\" for WIL, including: *first commercial station on the air in St. Louis *first to broadcast police news *first to broadcast election returns and *first to have its own news- gathering organization. In the 1930s, WIL branded itself as \\"The Biggest Little Station in the Nation\\".WIL Advertisement, Broadcasting, May 15, 1935, page 37. Under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, in March 1941 it, along with all the other stations transmitting on 1200 kHz, was moved to 1230 kHz. In 1949, WIL received permission to shift to a \\"regional\\" frequency, 1430 kHz, where it and its successors have been ever since. This new dial position also resulted in a major power increase, from 250 to 5,000 watts. WIL replaced KXOK (now KYFI) as St. Louis's ABC Radio affiliate on April 28, 1957. Later that year, the Bensons sold WIL, along with Fort Lauderdale, Florida sister station WWIL, to H. &. E. Balaban Corp. for $650,000. Beginning in the 1950s WIL was the first station in St. Louis to air a popular music format, and it was an early career stop in the late 1950s and early 1960s for some personalities who later achieved success in New York City radio, including WABC's Dan Ingram and Ron Lundy. It also boasted Jack Carney. WIL's rating eventually shrank due to competition from Storz Broadcasting's KXOK. In 1967, the Balabans sold WIL and its FM sister station, WIL-FM at 92.3 MHz, to LIN Broadcasting for $1.65 million; LIN immediately announced plans to program WIL as an all-news station. After one year, LIN changed WIL's format to country music on July 8, 1968. It became St. Louis's top country music outlet, while featuring personalities such as Davey Lee. In the mid-1970s, facing competition from startup country station WGNU-FM in Granite City, Illinois at 106.5 (now WARH), WIL's programs began to be simulcast over WIL- FM. By the early 1980s, WIL-FM was established as the top country music station in town, so the programming at the two stations was again separated, with WIL, on the AM band, adopting a classic country format. LIN Broadcasting put its radio stations up for sale on September 23, 1986; that November, it agreed to sell WIL and WIL-FM, along with its stations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Rochester, New York, to Heritage Communications in a $23 million deal. The following year, as part of Heritage's merger with Tele-Communications Inc., its stations were spun off to the company's executives for $200 million, forming Heritage Media. =WRTH= On June 21, 1990, WIL switched to an adult standards format, using Unistar's \\"Hits of the '40s, '50s and '60s\\" programming. That December, it announced a call sign change to WRTH, which took effect on January 18, 1991. The station inherited the format and call sign used for many years at 590 AM in Wood River, Illinois (now KFNS AM). Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire the Heritage Media stations for $630 million on July 14, 1997; the sale was completed in early 1998. Heritage was in the process of being acquired by News Corporation, which had no interest in operating radio stations. Emmis Communications announced plans to acquire Sinclair's St. Louis stations in June 1999; a year later, following subsequent litigation, Emmis agreed to only acquire six radio stations for $220 million, with Sinclair retaining television station KDNL-TV. Emmis then turned around and swapped WRTH, WIL-FM, and WVRV (now WXOS), along with its own WKKX (now WARH), to Bonneville International in exchange for KZLA-FM in Los Angeles; both deals were completed in October 2000. Facing the aging demographics of the nostalgia format, WRTH to a short-lived 50s/60s oldies format, dubbed \\"Real Oldies 1430\\", on June 27, 2003.\\"'Real Oldies' Arrives in St. Louis\\", Radio & Records, July 4, 2003, page 3. The adult standards format returned October 12, 2004. =Return to WIL= The call sign was changed back to WIL on June 29, 2005; on July 1, the station relaunched as \\"Country Legends 1430\\" with a classic country format. On July 20, 2006, severe thunderstorms caused major damage around St. Louis, leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity, and knocking down one of WIL's transmitting towers. (At the same time, two of the KTRS AM 550 towers were toppled, and KSLG AM 1380 was knocked off the air as well.) WIL had to apply for a special temporary authority from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate non-directionally with reduced power until the tower was replaced.(beradio.com) =KZQZ= In January 2008, Bonneville agreed to sell the station to the Entertainment Media Trust for $1.2 million; the deal did not include the rights to the WIL call sign. Following the sale's completion, on March 5, 2008, the call sign was changed to KZQZ, and the format was changed to oldies, branded as \\"Krazy Q\\". KZQZ and its sister Entertainment Media Trust stations had their licenses revoked on March 20, 2020 for being controlled by Bob Robanik, a convicted felon. Despite the license revocation, KZQZ programming continued on 1430 kHz, effectively as pirate radio, until early April 2020, just after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published stories about the continuing illegal broadcasts.

At Sutri, the two reached an agreement by which the city and some hill towns in Latium (like Vetralla) were given to the Papacy, \\"as a gift to the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul\\" according to the Liber Pontificalis. The pact formed the first extension of papal territory beyond the confines of the Duchy of Rome. History Sutri held a strategic importance as a fortified place near the borders of the Duchy of Rome, which commanded the road into Tuscany. In 728 the Lombard king Liutprand took the Castle of Sutri, which dominated the highway at Nepi on the road to Perugia. But Liutprand, softened by the entreaties of Pope Gregory II, restored Sutri \\"as a gift to the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul\\". According to Gustav Schn√ºrer, > This expression of the \\"Liber pontificalis\\" was erroneously interpreted to > mean that in this gift the beginning of the States of the Church was to be > recognized.

Penguin, 2004. p. 273. The suggestion for the rule came from Winston Churchill, who in 1919 was Secretary of State for War and Air. Former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour unsuccessfully argued to the Committee of Imperial Defence, which adopted the rule, that \\"nobody could say that from any one moment war was an impossibility for the next ten years ... we could not rest in a state of unpreparedness on such an assumption by anybody. To suggest that we could be nine and a half years away from preparedness would be a most dangerous suggestion.\\"Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power. Pan, 2002. p. 278. In 1928 Churchill, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, successfully urged the Cabinet to make the rule self-perpetuating, and hence it was in force unless specifically countermanded. In 1931 the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald wanted to abolish the Ten Year Rule because he thought it unjustified based on the international situation. This was bitterly opposed by the Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson who succeeded in keeping the rule.Kennedy, Rise and Fall, p. 296. There were very large cuts in defence spending as a result of this rule, with defence spending going down from ¬£766 million in 1919‚Äì20, to ¬£189 million in 1921‚Äì22, to ¬£102 million in 1932.Paul Kennedy, The Realities behind Diplomacy. Fontana, 1981. p. 231. In April 1931 the First Sea Lord, Sir Frederick Field, claimed in a report to the Committee of Imperial Defence that the Royal Navy had declined not only in relative strength compared to other Great Powers but \\"owing to the operation of the 'ten-year-decision' and the clamant need for economy, our absolute strength also has ... been so diminished as to render the fleet incapable, in the event of war, of efficiently affording protection to our trade\\". Field also claimed that the navy was below the standard required for keeping open Britain's sea communications during wartime and that if the navy moved to the East to protect the Empire there would not be enough ships to protect the British Isles and its trade from attack and that no port in the entire British Empire was \\"adequately defended\\".Barnett, The Collapse of British Power, p. 297. The Ten Year Rule was abandoned by the Cabinet on 23 March 1932, but this decision was countered with: \\"this must not be taken to justify an expanding expenditure by the Defence Services without regard to the very serious financial and economic situation\\" which the country was in due to the Great Depression.Kennedy, Rise and Fall, p. 285.Barnett, p. 301.

WXOS held the radio rights to the St. Louis Rams of the National Football League from 2009 to 2015 after which they relocated to Los Angeles. Rams games were previously aired on KLOU. History WXOS has adopted several call letters and formats since it began airing on May 13, 1966. The station first broadcast under WMRY and had studios based out of the Our Lady of the Snows shrine near Belleville. The station, however, never broadcast a religious format. Rather, they aired non- commercial pop music with periodic positive motivational messages from different faiths interspersed. In the mid-1980s, the station became a commercial station, and aired a progressive rock format. Their studios were relocated to an office park in St. Louis County, Missouri. In January 1991, the station flipped to soft AC as \\"Sunny 101\\", WSNL. Two months later, the station flipped to \\"mellow rock\\" as WFXB, \\"The Fox\\", and simulcasted on KFXB (105.7 FM). In February 1993, the simulcasting ended, though 101.1 would continue to carry the mellow rock format, which would evolve to a AAA format, and then an \\"Arrow\\"-type classic hits format, while still being called \\"The Fox.\\" On November 24, 1994, the station would return to AAA as \\"101 The River\\" and the WVRV call letters.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-11-25.pdf By Summer of 1997, the format evolved to modern AC.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-07-03.pdf In 2004, the format shifted to adult top 40, but retained the \\"River\\" moniker and call letters. MoViN' logo (2006‚Äì2008) On September 8, 2006, at 11:00 a.m., WVRV changed its format to Rhythmic adult contemporary, changed its moniker to \\"MOViN 101.1\\", and adopted the slogan of \\"Makes You Feel Good.\\" The first song on \\"MOViN\\" was \\"Good Vibrations\\" by Marky Mark & the Funky Bunch.http://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2006/09/18/the-river-runs-dry They were the fourth station to adopt the \\"MOViN\\" moniker, after KQMV Seattle, KMVN Los Angeles and KYMV Salt Lake City. The announcement was made with no prior notification to its on-air personalities, and they were dismissed on short notice, as is the norm in format switches. The station announced that it would go 90 days without personalities before DJs would be announced. Under the Rhythmic AC format, the station's playlist consisted of \\"adult rhythmic hits from today, the 1980s and 1990s, plus a sprinkling of rhythmic classics.\\" The station would change call letters to WMVN shortly afterward. The first on- air DJs were former Steve & DC castmember Jill Devine (10a-3p), Mysti (2-7p) and Raven Rush (7p-mid), who joined on December 15. On February 12, 2007, former KYKY morning show co-host Steph Duran joined MOViN' for mornings. Prior to joining WMVN, Duran had been at KZON and KUPD in Phoenix. She was joined on September 1, 2007 by co host Eric Schmidt. Schmidt had previously worked at WMVN sister station WARH. A veteran of the St. Louis market he had also worked at WVRV, KPNT, WXTM, WMLL, KCLC, and KFAV. WMVN was programmed by Jules Riley, who also programs WARH. After an economic-related shakeup on March 3, 2008, Mysti and Raven Rush were let go. Schmidt moved to the 2-7p slot and Steph Duran took a solo morning shift. The format was shifted to Hot AC after this. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that WMVN would flip to an all-sports format on January 1, 2009, featuring a combination of local and ESPN Radio programming. The station would also change call letters to the current WXOS. To prepare for the change, on October 10, WMVN began stunting with all- Christmas music, which lasted until the full format flip occurred. Bonneville International announced the sale of WXOS, as well as 16 other stations, to Twin Cities-based Hubbard Broadcasting on January 19, 2011. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011.

Left panel shows tissue section with selected cells removed. Right panel shows isolated epithelial cells on transfer film. Laser capture microdissection (LCM), also called microdissection, laser microdissection (LMD), or laser-assisted microdissection (LMD or LAM), is a method for isolating specific cells of interest from microscopic regions of tissue/cells/organisms (dissection on a microscopic scale with the help of a laser). Principle Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) is a method to procure subpopulations of tissue cells under direct microscopic visualization. LCM technology can harvest the cells of interest directly or can isolate specific cells by cutting away unwanted cells to give histologically pure enriched cell populations. A variety of downstream applications exist: DNA genotyping and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, RNA transcript profiling, cDNA library generation, proteomics discovery and signal-pathway profiling. The total time required to carry out this protocol is typically 1‚Äì1.5 h. Extraction A laser is coupled into a microscope and focuses onto the tissue on the slide. By movement of the laser by optics or the stage the focus follows a trajectory which is predefined by the user. This trajectory, also called element, is then cut out and separated from the adjacent tissue. After the cutting process, an extraction process has to follow if an extraction process is desired. More recent technologies utilize non-contact microdissection. There are several ways to extract tissue from a microscope slide with a histopathology sample on it. Press a sticky surface onto the sample and tear out. This extracts the desired region, but can also remove particles or unwanted tissue on the surface, because the surface is not selective. Melt a plastic membrane onto the sample and tear out. The heat is introduced, for example, by a red or infrared (IR) laser onto a membrane stained with an absorbing dye. As this adheres the desired sample onto the membrane, as with any membrane that is put close to the histopathology sample surface, there might be some debris extracted. Another danger is the introduced heat: Some molecules like DNA, RNA, or protein don't allow to be heated too much or at all for the goal of being isolated as purely as possible. For transport without contact. There are three different approaches. Transport by gravity using an upright microscope (called GAM, gravity-assisted microdissection) or transport by laser pressure catapult; the most recent generation utilizes a technology based on laser induced forward transfer (LIFT). With cut-and-capture, a cap coated with an adhesive is positioned directly on the thinly cut (5-8 Œºm) tissue section, the section itself resting on a thin membrane (polyethylene naphthalene). An IR laser gently heats the adhesive on the cap fusing it to the underlying tissue and an UV laser cuts through tissue and underlying membrane. The membrane-tissue entity now adheres to the cap and the cells on the cap can be used in downstream applications (DNA, RNA, protein analysis).  Procedure Laser Capture Microdissection Under a microscope using a software interface, a tissue section (typically 5-50 micrometres thick) is viewed and individual cells or clusters of cells are identified either manually or in semi-automated or more fully automated ways allowing the imaging and then automatic selection of targets for isolation. Currently six primary isolation/collection technologies exist using a microscope and device for cell isolation. Four of these typically use an ultraviolet pulsed laser (355 nm) for the cutting of the tissues directly or the membranes/film, and sometimes in combination with an IR laser responsible for heating/melting a sticky polymer for cellular adhesion and isolation. IR laser provides a more gentle approach to microdissection. A fifth ultraviolet laser based technology uses special slides coated with an energy transfer coating which, when activated by the laser pulse, propels the tissue or cells into a collection cap. The laser cutting width is usually less than 1 Œºm, thus the target cells are not affected by the laser beam. Even live cells are not damaged by the laser cutting and are viable after cutting for cloning and reculturing as appropriate. The various technologies differ in the collection process, possible imaging methods (fluorescence microscopy/bright field microscopy/differential interference contrast microscopy/phase contrast microscopy/ etc.) and the types of holders and tissue preparation needed before the imaging and isolation. Most are primarily dedicated micro- dissection systems, and some can be used as research microscopes as well, only one technology (#2 here, Leica) uses an upright microscope, limiting some of the sample handling capabilities somewhat, especially for live cell work. The first technology (used by Carl Zeiss PALM) cuts around the sample then collects it by a \\"catapulting\\" technology. The sample can be catapulted from a slide or special culture dish by a defocused U.V laser pulse which generates a photonic force to propel the material off the slide/dish, a technique sometimes called Laser Micro-dissection Pressure Catapulting (LMPC). The dissected material is sent upward (up to several millimetres) to a microfuge tube cap or other collector which contains either a buffer or a specialized tacky material in the tube cap that the tissue will adhere to. This active catapulting process avoids some of the static problems when using membrane- coated slides. Another process follows gravity-assisted microdissection method that turns on gravity to collect samples in tube cap under the slide used (used by ION LMD system, Jungwoo F&B;). In case of this system, it moves the motorized stage to cut the cells of interests, keeping the laser beam fixed. And the system uses a 355 nm Solid-state laser(UV-A) which is the safest way to cut the tissues without RNA or DNA damage. Another closely related LCM process (used by Leica) cuts the sample from above and the sample drops via gravity (gravity-assisted microdissection) into a capture device below the sample. The different point with upper one is, the laser beam here is moving to cut tissue by moving dichroic mirror. When the cells (on a slide or special culture dish) of choice are in the center of the field of view, the operator selects the cells of interest using instrument software. The area to be isolated when a near-IR laser to activate transfer film on a cap placed on the tissue sample, melting the adhesive which then fuses the film with the underlying cells of choice (see Arcturus systems); and/or by activating a UV laser to cut out the cell of interest. The cells are then lifted off the thin tissue section, leaving all unwanted cells behind. The cells of interest are then viewed and documented prior to extraction. The fourth UV based technology (used by Molecular Machines and Industries AG) offers a slight difference to the 3rd technology here by essentially creating a sandwich of sorts with slide>sample>and membrane overlying the sample by the use of a frame slide whose membrane surface is cut by the laser and ultimately picked up from above by a special adhesive cap. A fifth UV based technology uses standard glass slides coated with an inert energy transfer coating and a UV based laser microdissection system (typically a Leica LMD or PALM Zeiss machine). Tissue sections are mounted on top of the energy transfer coating. The energy from a UV laser is converted to kinetic energy upon striking the coating, vaporizing it, instantly propelling selected tissue features into the collection tube. The energy transfer coated slides, commercialized under the trade name DIRECTOR slides by Expression Pathology Inc. (Rockville, MD), offer several advantages for proteomic work. They also do not autofluoresce, so they can be used for applications using fluorescent stains, DIC or polarized light. In addition to tissue sections, LCM can be performed on living cells/organisms, cell smears, chromosome preparations, and plant tissue. Applications The laser capture microdissection process does not alter or damage the morphology and chemistry of the sample collected, nor the surrounding cells. For this reason, LCM is a useful method of collecting selected cells for DNA, RNA and/or protein analyses. LCM has also been used to isolate acellular structures, such as amyloid plaques. LCM can be performed on a variety of tissue samples including blood smears, cytologic preparations, cell cultures and aliquots of solid tissue. Frozen and paraffin embedded archival tissue may also be used.

Some types of escape response may include camouflage, freezing behaviour, and fleeing, among others It is an anti-predator behaviour that varies from species to species. In fact, variation between individuals is linked to increased survival. In addition, it is not merely increased speed that contributes to the success of the escape response; other factors, including reaction time and the individual's context can play a role. The individual escape response of a particular animal can vary based on an animal's previous experience and current state.  Evolutionary importance The escape response, a particular type of anti-predator behaviour, is vital to the survival of species. Individuals that are able to execute an escape response quickly are more likely to flee from predators and avoid predation. Arjun et al. (2017) found that it is not necessarily the speed of the response itself, but the greater distance between the targeted individual and the predator when the response is executed. In addition, the escape response of an individual is directly related to the threat of the predator. Predators that pose the biggest risk to the population will evoke the greatest escape response. Therefore, it may be an adaptive trait selected for by natural selection. Law & Blake (1996) argue that many morphological characteristics could contribute to an individual's efficient escape response, but the escape response has undoubtedly been molded by evolution. In their study, they compared more recent sticklebacks to their ancestral form, the Paxton Lake stickleback, and found that the performance of the ancestral form was significantly lower. Therefore, one may conclude that this response has been ripened by evolution.  Neurobiology  The neurobiology of the escape response varies from species to species, but some consistencies exist. In fish and amphibians, the escape response appears to be elicited by Mauthner cells, two giant neurons located in the rhombomere 4 of the hindbrain. In larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), they sense predators using their lateral line system. When larvae are positioned lateral to a predator, they will escape in a likewise lateral direction. According to game theory, zebrafish who are positioned lateral and ventral to the predator are more likely to survive, rather than any alternate strategy. Finally, the faster (cm/s) the predator is moving, the faster downward the fish will move to escape predation. In vertebrates, the avoidance behaviour appears to be processed in the telencephalon. This has been shown repeatedly in goldfish, as individuals with ablated telencephalons were significantly impaired in acquiring avoidance behaviour. As a result, some researchers conclude that damage to the telencephalon can interfere with the emotion internal fear to produce an avoidance response. Researchers will often evoke an escape response to test the potency of hormones and/or medication and their relationship to stress. As such, the escape response is fundamental to anatomical and pharmacological research.  Role of learning  Research has found that habituation, the process that allows individuals to learn to identify harmless events, has a significant impact on the perception of fear in the presence of a predator. Habituation allows animals to discriminate between false alarms and real, dangerous events. While many do not consider habituation a form of learning, many researchers are beginning to suggest that it could be a form of associative learning. For example, zebra danios who are habituated to predators are more latent to flee than those who were not habituated to predators. However, habituation did not affect the fish's angle of escape from the predator. If an animal engages in an escape response, but is repeatedly unable to escape, they will eventually cease to escape. This is known as learned helplessness. In Drosophila melanogaster, the frequency of an escape reaction will decrease in an individual who is subjected to uncontrollable shocks. However, this learning is context-dependent, as when these flies are placed in a new environment, they will again exhibit the escape response.  Examples  = In birds = Avian species also display unique escape responses. The escape response of birds may be particularly important when considering aircraft and vehicle traffic. In one experiment by Devault et al. (1989), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were exposed to a demonstration of traffic travelling at speeds between 60 ‚Äì 360 km/hr. When approached by a vehicle travelling at 120 km/h, the birds only allotted 0.8s to escape before a possible collision. This study showed that fast traffic speeds may not allow enough time for birds to initiate an escape response. = In fish = Generally, when faced with a dangerous stimuli, fish will contract their axial muscle, resulting a C-shaped contraction away from the stimulus. This response occurs in two separate stages: a muscle contraction that allows them to speed away from a stimulus (stage 1), and a sequential contralateral movement (stage 2). This escape is also known as a \\"fast-start response\\". The majority of the fish respond to an external stimulus (pressure changes) within 5 to 15 milliseconds, while some will exhibit a slower response taking up to 80 milliseconds. While the escape response generally only propels the fish a small distance away, this distance is long enough to prevent predation. While many predators use water pressure to catch their prey, this short distance prevents them from feeding on the fish via suction. Particularly in the case of fish, it has been hypothesized that the differences in escape response are due to the evolution of neural circuits over time. This can be witnessed by observing the difference in the extent of stage 1 behaviour, and the distinct muscle activity in stage 2 of the C-start or fast-start response. Recent research in guppies has shown that familiarity can affect the reaction time involved in the escape response. Guppies that were placed in familiar groups were more likely to respond than guppies who were assigned to unfamiliar groups. Wolcott et al. (2017) suggest that familiar groups may lead to reduced inspection and aggression among conspecifics. The theory of limited attention states that the brain has a limited amount of information processing, and, as an individual is engaged in more tasks, the less resources it can provide to one given task. As a result, they have more attention that they can devote toward anti-predator behaviour. = In insects = Recent research suggests that the escape response in Musca domestica may be controlled by the compound eyes. When house flies (Musca domestica) encounter an aversive stimulus, they jump rapidly and fly away from the stimulus. A recent research suggests that the escape response in Musca domestica is controlled by a pair of compound eyes, rather than by the ocelli. When one of the compound eyes was covered, the minimum threshold to elicit an escape response increased. In short, the escape reaction of Musca domestica is evoked by the combination of both motion and light. Cockroaches are also well known for their escape response. When individuals sense a wind puff, they will turn and escape in the opposite direction. The sensory neurons in the paired caudal cerci (singular: cercus) at the rear of the animal send a message along the ventral nerve cord. Then, one of two responses are elicited: running (through the ventral giant interneurons) or flying/running (through the dorsal giant interneurons). = In mammals = Higher-order mammals often evoke a withdrawal reflex. A withdrawal reflex is defined as a type of spinal reflex designed to protect the body from damaging stimuli, and involves pulling the body part away from the dangerous stimuli. In one study, Stankowich & Coss (2007) studied the flight initiation distance of Columbian black-tailed deer. According to the authors, the flight initiation distance is the distance between prey and predator when the prey attempts an escape response. They found that the angle, distance, and speed that the deer escaped was related to the distance between the deer and its predator, a human male in this experiment. = Other examples = Squids have developed a multitude of anti-predator escape responses, including: jet-driven escape, postural displays, inking and camouflage. Inking and jet-driven escape are arguably the most salient responses, in which the individual squirts ink at the predator as it speeds away. These blobs of ink can vary in size and shape; larger blobs can distract the predator while smaller blobs can provide a cover under which the squid can disappear. Finally, the released ink also contains hormones such as L-dopa and dopamine that can warn other conspecifics of danger while blocking olfactory receptors in the targeted predator. Cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) avoid predation using a freezing behaviour. Some cuttlefish also use a jet-driven escape response. Cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) are also well known for their escape responses. Unlike squids, who may engage more salient escape responses, the cuttlefish has few defences so it relies on more conspicuous means: jet-driven escape and freezing behaviour. However, it appears that the majority of cuttlefish use a freezing escape response when avoiding predation. When the cuttlefish freeze, it minimizes the voltage of their bioelectric field, making them less susceptible to their predators, mainly sharks.

It wasn't going anywhere so the Zarlors decided to hire outside help. There are six key installations on the Mendicant's home planet of Yorith. The first mission is the Cadmar Desert where you are to locate and destroy a super weapon. The second mission Mesort Swamp holds a secret base. Third mission is in the Docrit Sea where you have to destroy the Mendicant Navy. Forth mission titled Sedimor Domes is to attack a moon in the sector. Mardic Ice is the fifth mission where you fly to the ice caps of Mardi Koldavia, these ice caps are described as radioactive and here the Mendicants have built nuclear reactors, power plants and weapons factories. The sixth and final mission is Cedmite City the only city on the Mendicant planet, the Zarlors have ask for everything to be destroyed, all to be cleared out for colonisation. Development Peter Engelbrite at Epyx who was known for including easter eggs and mini-games in Atari Lynx games also included a version of the cellular automata, Conway's Game of Life in Zarlor Mercenary. Reception In Computer and Video Games, Paul Glancey called Zarlor Mercenary \\"a decent- looking shoot 'em up, but quite difficult and not overly exciting to play.\\" Clayton Walnum wrote in STart, \\"As you struggle to destroy the attacking aliens and blast the ground targets, you'll begin to understand what people mean by the term 'control pad ache'. This blastathon will please all players with a thirst for destruction.\\" In a 1999 retrospective review, Robert Jung of IGN stated \\"A great no-nonsense action game, perfect for people who love the 'shoot it if it exists' philosophy. The game itself is not easy, and the addition of four-player teamups and cash payments/transfers/power-ups ensure quite a bit of variety to the game. Though there are only six levels, they are quite varied, and should offer many challenging hours to the average player.\\" Kyle Knight of AllGame praised the graphics but stated that \\"Zarlor Mercenary moves sluggishly\\".

Summary =New York Yankees vs. Kansas City Royals= Game summaries =Game 1= The opener was played on a bright Saturday afternoon at Royals Stadium and pitted Yankee ace Jim \\"Catfish\\" Hunter against left-hander and ex-Yankee Larry Gura. The Yankees got off to a quick start, scoring two in the first aided by a pair of George Brett throwing errors. Hunter was in top form and went the distance, not going to a three-ball count the entire game. While the Royals were able to halve that margin going into the ninth, Roy White's two-run double in the top of the frame gave the Yanks two insurance runs that were the final scoring in a tidy 4‚Äì1 win. =Game 2= Five Yankee errors helped key the Royals series-tying win. Lefty Paul Splittorff was solid with innings of work in relief of Brooklyn native Dennis Leonard, while Yankee reliever Dick Tidrow was ineffective and permitted three more Kansas City runs to score in the eighth after relieving starter Ed Figueroa with one out in the sixth. The series, now tied at one, moved to New York and newly remodelled Yankee Stadium for the remaining three games. =Game 3= The first Yankee post-season home game since 1964 started ominously for the Bombers, as the Royals tagged righty Dock Ellis for three runs in the first. He settled down immediately after though and went eight solid innings, aided by several double plays and two base runners caught stealing. The Yankees narrowed the margin to one in the fourth on a Chris Chambliss two-run homer off Andy Hassler and then tacked on three more in the sixth, as Kansas City manager Whitey Herzog carted in four relievers in that inning alone. Sparky Lyle got the save by pitching a scoreless ninth inning, as the Bronx Bombers took a two games to one lead. =Game 4= Hoping to wrap up the series in four games, Yankee manager Billy Martin brought back Catfish Hunter on three days' rest while the Royals did the same, bringing back Larry Gura. Neither fared well, as Gura gave up six hits and two runs in two innings, while Hunter lasted three and surrendered five runs on five hits. Though the Yankees' bullpen was able to hold Kansas City to only two runs over six innings, winning pitcher Doug Bird only gave up one in , while lefty Steve Mingori pitched and allowed only one tally, picking up the save. The Yankee offense was highlighted by Graig Nettles' two homers and three RBI. The series was then knotted at two, with a deciding Game 5 to be played the next night. =Game 5= The deciding game was a fitting ending to a thrilling series, as both teams fought tooth and nail to bring home the AL flag. It culminated in a moment of sheer, unbridled joy for the winners and stunned disbelief for the losers. The Yankees started Ed Figueroa on three days rest, as the Royals did likewise, starting Dennis Leonard. The Royals jumped out on top in the first, as Brett doubled and scored on John Mayberry's two-run homer. The Yankees quickly countered in their half, with Mickey Rivers tripling and scoring on Roy White's infield single. White went to third after Thurman Munson singled. Herzog removed Leonard and brought in Game 2 winner Paul Splittorff, who limited the damage by allowing only Chambliss' sacrifice fly. The Royals countered with one in the second, but the Yanks jumped ahead in the third, as they tacked on two; one on a Munson single and the other on a Chambliss' ground out. The Yanks added on in the sixth, scoring twice; once on a Munson single and a second time on a Brett throwing error. Figueroa held that lead going into the eighth. After Al Cowens led off with a single, Billy Martin brought in lefty Grant Jackson. He allowed a single to pinch hitter Jim Wohlford. Brett then stunned the sell-out crowd of 56,821 by planting Jackson's second pitch just over the short right-field wall, tying the game at six. All this was a prelude to the bottom of the ninth inning, when, at 11:43 pm, Chris Chambliss turned on Kansas City reliever Mark Littell's first pitch and sent it over the right center field wall. Thousands of fans vaulted over the dugouts and walls and celebrated the Yankees' first pennant in 12 years. Chambliss reached second, then dodged hordes of spectators in trying to reach third. He then proceeded to make a beeline towards the safety of the clubhouse, as the area around home plate and much of the field was covered with celebrating fans. Some time later, Chambliss was escorted back out onto the field to touch home, but the plate had been stolen. He touched the area where the plate had been. He was later informed by the umpires that given the circumstances of the situation, they would have counted the run regardless. Composite box 1976 ALCS (3‚Äì2): New York Yankees over Kansas City Royals Aftermath Chambliss was later cornered in the Yankee locker room by Graig Nettles, who asked him if he had touched home. Chambliss responded that he had not, because there were too many people in the way. Nettles then told him that home plate umpire Art Frantz was waiting for him out on the field for him to touch home so that the home run could be ruled official. Chambliss was then escorted out to the field and touched the area where home had been. Kansas City manager Whitey Herzog did not attempt to contest the home run, although major league rules state that a player must touch all the bases on any hit or when running the bases. In this case, the mayhem on the field made that task impossible, and the magnitude of the game was such that Herzog would have never tried to have it restarted or protested it due to a technicality. As mentioned above, the umpires had already decided that his home run counted. As a result, MLB amended rule 4.09 calling it \\"The Chris Chambliss Rule\\" The exception states: Rule 4.09(b) Comment: An exception will be if fans rush onto the field and physically prevent the runner from touching home plate or the batter from touching first base. In such cases, the umpires shall award the runner the base because of the obstruction by the fans. This had the effect of codifying the decision the umpires made in Game 5. Brett's home run was the first of nine that he hit in ALCS competition. Six of those came against the Yankees: one in 1976, three in 1978, and two in 1980. His other three ALCS home runs, which came in the 1985 ALCS, were all against one pitcher, Doyle Alexander of the Blue Jays. Alexander was a Yankee in 1976. He warmed up in the bullpen during Game 5, and started the first game of the World Series for them against the Cincinnati Reds. The series also contained some interesting side stories. Kansas City pitcher Larry Gura publicly criticized Yankee manager Billy Martin prior to the series, saying that Martin treated him shabbily in the short time Martin was his manager in New York. Gura was on the Yankees' roster from spring training till the time he was traded to Kansas City on May 16. He did not appear in any games for the Yankees in that time. Martin responded by saying that if he had him there with the Yankees at that moment, he'd get rid of him again. George Brett also had harsh words for Martin, as he claimed that Martin had lied to his brother, pitcher Ken Brett, when Ken spent the first two months of 1976 with the Yanks. George's brother appeared in two games for the Yankees over two months, and was then traded to the Chicago White Sox. This was the first of three consecutive ALCS between the two teams. They also went head to head in 1977 and 1978, with the Yankees coming out on top again. The Royals, however, exacted a big measure of revenge when they met again in the 1980 ALCS and swept the Bombers in three straight. References Further reading *Catfish: My Life in Baseball.

The affair resulted in the shutdown of the Bank and its replacement by state banks. The Second Bank of the United States was established as a private organization with a 20-year charter, having the exclusive right to conduct banking on a national scale. The goal behind the B.U.S. was to stabilize the American economy by establishing a uniform currency and strengthening the federal government. Supporters of the Bank regarded it as a stabilizing force in the economy due to its ability to smooth out variations in prices and trade, extend credit, supply the nation with a sound and uniform currency, provide fiscal services for the treasury department, facilitate long-distance trade, and prevent inflation by regulating the lending practices of state banks. Jacksonian Democrats cited instances of corruption and alleged that the B.U.S. favored merchants and speculators at the expense of farmers and artisans, appropriated public money for risky private investments and interference in politics, and conferred economic privileges on a small group of stockholders and financial elites, thereby violating the principle of equal opportunity. Some found the Bank's public‚Äìprivate organization to be unconstitutional, and argued that the institution's charter violated state sovereignty. To them, the Bank symbolized corruption while threatening liberty. In early 1832, the president of the B.U.S., Nicholas Biddle, in alliance with the National Republicans under Senators Henry Clay (KY) and Daniel Webster (MA), submitted an application for a renewal of the Bank's twenty-year charter four years before the charter was set to expire, intending to pressure Jackson into making a decision prior to the 1832 presidential election, in which Jackson would face Clay. When Congress voted to reauthorize the Bank, Jackson vetoed the bill. His veto message was a polemical declaration of the social philosophy of the Jacksonian movement that pitted \\"the planters, the farmers, the mechanic and the laborer\\" against the \\"monied interest\\". The B.U.S. became the central issue that divided the Jacksonians from the National Republicans. Although the Bank provided significant financial assistance to Clay and pro-B.U.S. newspaper editors, Jackson secured an overwhelming election victory. Fearing economic reprisals from Biddle, Jackson swiftly removed the Bank's federal deposits. In 1833, he arranged to distribute the funds to dozens of state banks. The new Whig Party emerged in opposition to his perceived abuse of executive power, officially censuring Jackson in the Senate. In an effort to promote sympathy for the institution's survival, Biddle retaliated by contracting Bank credit, inducing a mild financial downturn. A reaction set in throughout America‚Äôs financial and business centers against Biddle's maneuvers, compelling the Bank to reverse its tight money policies, but its chances of being rechartered were all but finished. The economy did extremely well during Jackson's time as president, but his economic policies, including his war against the Bank, are sometimes blamed for contributing to the Panic of 1837. Resurrection of a national banking system The First Bank of the United States was established at the direction of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton in 1791. Hamilton supported the Bank because he believed that it would increase the authority and influence of the federal government, effectively manage trade and commerce, strengthen the national defense, and pay the debt. It was subject to attacks from agrarians and constructionists led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. They believed that it was unconstitutional because the Constitution did not expressly allow for it, would infringe on the rights of the states, and would benefit a small group while delivering no advantage to the many, especially farmers. Hamilton's view won out and the Bank was created. More states and localities began to charter their own banks. State banks printed their own notes which were sometimes used out-of-state, and this encouraged other states to establish banks in order to compete. President Madison and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin supported recharter of the First Bank in 1811. They cited \\"expediency\\" and \\"necessity,\\" not principle. Opponents of the Bank defeated recharter by a single vote in both the House and Senate in 1811. State banks opposed recharter of the national bank because when state bank notes were deposited with the First Bank of the United States, the Bank would present these notes to state banks and demand gold in exchange, which limited the state banks' ability to issue notes and maintain adequate reserves of specie, or hard money. At that time, bank notes could be exchanged for a fixed value of gold or silver. alt=An old stone building with pillars. Classical Greek style architecture. The arguments in favor of reviving a national system of finance, as well as internal improvements and protective tariffs, were prompted by national security concerns during the War of 1812. The chaos of the war had, according to some, \\"demonstrated the absolute necessity of a national banking system\\". The push for the creation of a new national bank occurred during the post-war period of American history known as the Era of Good Feelings. There was a strong movement to increase the power of the federal government. Some people blamed a weak central government for America's poor performance during much of the War of 1812. Humiliated by its opposition to the war, the Federalist Party, founded by Hamilton, collapsed. Nearly all politicians joined the Republican Party, founded by Jefferson. It was hoped that the disappearance of the Federalist Party would mark the end of party politics. But even in the new single party system, ideological and sectional differences began to flare up once again over several issues, one of them being the campaign to recharter the Bank. In 1815, Secretary of State James Monroe told President Madison that a national bank \\"would attach the commercial part of the community in a much greater degree to the Government [and] interest them in its operations‚Ä¶This is the great desideratum [essential objective] of our system.\\" Support for this \\"national system of money and finance\\" grew with the post-war economy and land boom, uniting the interests of eastern financiers with southern and western Republican nationalists. The roots for the resurrection of the Bank of the United States lay fundamentally in the transformation of America from a simple agrarian economy to one that was becoming interdependent with finance and industry. Vast western lands were opening for white settlement, accompanied by rapid development, enhanced by steam power and financial credit. Economic planning at the federal level was deemed necessary by Republican nationalists to promote expansion and encourage private enterprise. At the same time, they tried to \\"republicanize Hamiltonian bank policy.\\" John C. Calhoun, a representative from South Carolina and strong nationalist, boasted that the nationalists had the support of the yeomanry, who would now \\"share in the capital of the Bank\\". Despite opposition from Old Republicans led by John Randolph of Roanoke, who saw the revival of a national bank as purely Hamiltonian and a threat to state sovereignty, but with strong support from nationalists such as Calhoun and Henry Clay, the recharter bill for the Second Bank of the United States was passed by Congress. The charter was signed into law by Madison on April 10, 1816. The Second Bank of the United States was given considerable powers and privileges under its charter. Its headquarters was established in Philadelphia, but it could create branches anywhere. It enjoyed the exclusive right to conduct banking on a national basis. It transferred Treasury funds without charge. The federal government purchased a fifth of the Bank's stock, appointed a fifth of its directors, and deposited its funds in the Bank. B.U.S. notes were receivable for federal bonds. \\"Jackson and Reform\\": Implications for the B.U.S. =Panic of 1819= alt=A thin man with gray hair and a tall black collar and block overcoat. The inside of the overcoat is red. The rise of Jacksonian democracy was achieved through harnessing the widespread social resentments and political unrest persisting since the Panic of 1819 and the Missouri Crisis of 1820. The Panic was caused by the rapid resurgence of the European economy after the Napoleonic Wars, where improved agriculture caused the prices of American goods to drop, and a scarcity of specie due to unrest in the Spanish American colonies. The situation was exacerbated by the B.U.S. under Bank President William Jones through fraud and the rapid emission of paper money. He eventually began to call in loans, but nonetheless was removed by the Bank's directors. Langdon Cheves, who replaced Jones as president, worsened the situation by reducing the Bank's liabilities by more than half, lessening the value of Bank notes, and more than tripling the Bank's specie held in reserve. As a result, the prices of American goods abroad collapsed. This led to the failure of state banks and the collapse of businesses, turning what could have been a brief recession into a prolonged depression. Financial writer William Gouge wrote that \\"the Bank was saved and the people were ruined\\". After the Panic of 1819, popular anger was directed towards the nation's banks, particularly the B.U.S. Many people demanded more limited Jeffersonian government, especially after revelations of fraud within the Bank and its attempts to influence elections. Andrew Jackson, previously a major general in the United States Army and former territorial governor of Florida, sympathized with these concerns, privately blaming the Bank for causing the Panic by contracting credit. In a series of memorandums, he attacked the federal government for widespread abuses and corruption. These included theft, fraud, and bribery, and they occurred regularly at branches of the National Bank. In Mississippi, the Bank did not open branches outside of the city of Natchez, making small farmers in rural areas unable to make use of its capital. Members of the planter class and other economic elites who were well- connected often had an easier time getting loans. According to historian Edward E. Baptist, \\"A state bank could be an ATM machine for those connected to its directors.\\" One such example was in Kentucky, where in 1817 the state legislature chartered forty banks, with notes redeemable to the Bank of Kentucky. Inflation soon rose and the Kentucky Bank became in debt to the National Bank. Several states, including Kentucky, fed up with debt owed to the Bank and widespread corruption, laid taxes on the National Bank in order to force it out of existence. In McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Supreme Court ruled that the Bank was both constitutional and that, as an agent of the federal government, it could not be taxed. In 1819, Monroe appointed Nicholas Biddle of Philadelphia as Government Director of the Bank. In 1823, he was unanimously elected its president. According to early Jackson biographer James Parton, Biddle \\"was a man of the pen‚Äîquick, graceful, fluent, honorable, generous, but not practically able; not a man for a stormy sea and a lee shore\\". Biddle believed that the Bank had the right to operate independently from Congress and the Executive, writing that \\"no officer of the Government, from the President downwards, has the least right, the least authority\\" to meddle \\"in the concerns of the Bank\\". =Rise of Jackson= The end of the War of 1812 was accompanied by an increase in white male suffrage. Jackson, as a war hero, was popular with the masses. With their support, he ran for president in 1824. The election turned into a five-way contest between Jackson, Calhoun, John Quincy Adams, William H. Crawford, and Clay. All were members of the Republican Party, which was still the only political party in the country. Calhoun eventually dropped out to run for vice president, lowering the number of candidates to four. Jackson won decisive pluralities in both the Electoral College and the popular vote. He did not win an electoral majority, which meant that the election was decided in the House of Representatives, which would choose among the top three vote-getters in the Electoral College. Clay finished fourth. However, he was also Speaker of the House, and he maneuvered the election in favor of Adams, who in turn made Clay Secretary of State, an office that in the past had served as a stepping stone to the presidency. Jackson was enraged by this so-called \\"corrupt bargain\\" to subvert the will of the people. As president, Adams pursued an unpopular course by attempting to strengthen the powers of the federal government by undertaking large infrastructure projects and other ventures which were alleged to infringe on state sovereignty and go beyond the proper role of the central government. Division during his administration led to the end of the single party era. Supporters of Adams began calling themselves National Republicans. Supporters of Jackson became known as Jacksonians and, eventually, Democrats. In 1828, Jackson ran again. Most Old Republicans had supported Crawford in 1824. Alarmed by the centralization in the Adams administration, most of them flocked to Jackson. The transition was made relatively easy by the fact that Jackson's own principles of government, including commitment to reducing the debt and returning power to the states, were largely in line with their own. Jackson ran under the banner of \\"Jackson and Reform\\", promising a return to Jeffersonian principles of limited government and an end to the centralizing policies of Adams. The Democrats launched a spirited and sophisticated campaign. They characterized Adams as a purveyor of corruption and fraudulent republicanism, and a menace to American democracy. At the heart of the campaign was the conviction that Andrew Jackson had been denied the presidency in 1824 only through a \\"corrupt bargain\\"; a Jackson victory promised to rectify this betrayal of the popular will. alt=A stocky black-haired man with a white shirt, black bow-tie, and black suit Although slavery was not a major issue in Jackson's rise to the presidency, it did sometimes factor into opposition to the Second Bank, specifically among those in the South who were suspicious of how augmented federal power at the expense of the states might affect the legality of slavery. Old Republican Nathaniel Macon remarked, \\"If Congress can make banks, roads and canals under the Constitution, they can free any slave in the United States.\\" In 1820, John Tyler of Virginia wrote that \\"if Congress can incorporate a bank, it might emancipate a slave\\". Jackson was both the champion and beneficiary of the revival of the Jeffersonian North‚ÄìSouth alliance. The Jacksonian movement reasserted the Old Republican precepts of limited government, strict construction, and state sovereignty. Federal institutions that conferred privileges producing \\"artificial inequality\\" would be eliminated through a return to strict constructionism. The \\"planter of the South and the plain Republican of the North\\" would provide the support, with the aid of universal white male suffrage. In the end, Jackson won the election decisively, taking 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The Jacksonian coalition had to contend with a fundamental incompatibility between its hard money and paper money factions, for which reason Jackson‚Äôs associates never offered a platform on banking and finance reform, because to do so \\"might upset Jackson's delicately balanced coalition\\". Jackson and other advocates of hard money believed that paper money was part of \\"a corrupting and demoralizing system that made the rich richer, and the poor poorer\\". Gold and silver was the only way of having a \\"fair and stable\\" currency. The aversion to paper money went back before the American Revolution. Inflation caused during the Revolutionary War by printing enormous amounts of paper money added to the distrust, and opposition to it was a major reason for Hamilton's difficulties in securing the charter of the First Bank of the United States. Supporters of soft money tended to want easy credit. Aspiring entrepreneurs, a number of them on the cotton frontier in the American southwest, resented the Bank not because it printed paper money, but because it did not print more and loan it to them. Banks have to lend more money than they take in. When banks lend money, new money is actually created, which is called \\"credit\\". This money has to be paper; otherwise, a bank can only lend as much as it takes in and hence new currency cannot be created out of nothing. Paper money was therefore necessary to grow the economy. Banks making too many loans would print an excess of paper money and deflate the currency. This would lead to lenders demanding that the banks take back their devalued paper in exchange for specie, as well as debtors trying to pay off loans with the same deflated currency, seriously disrupting the economy. Because of the failure to emphasize the distinction between hard money and paper money, as well as the Bank's popularity, the Second Bank of the United States was not a major issue in the 1828 elections. In fact, Biddle voted for Jackson in the election. Jackson himself, though naturally averse to the Bank, had recommended the establishment of a branch in Pensacola. He also signed a certificate with recommendations for president and cashier of the branch in Nashville. The Bank had largely recovered in the public eye since the Panic of 1819 and had grown to be accepted as a fact of life. Its role in managing the nation's fiscal affairs was central. The Bank printed much of the nation's paper money, which made it a target for supporters of hard money, while also restricting the activities of smaller banks, which created some resentment from those who wanted easy credit. As of 1830, the Bank had $50 million in specie in reserve, approximately half the value of its paper currency. It tried to ensure steady growth by forcing state-chartered banks to keep specie reserves. This meant that smaller banks lent less money, but that their notes were more reliable. Jackson would not publicly air his grievances with the B.U.S. until December 1829. Prelude to war =Initial attitudes= When Jackson entered the White House in March 1829, dismantling the Bank was not part of his reform agenda. Although the President harbored an antipathy toward all banks, several members of his initial cabinet advised a cautious approach when it came to the B.U.S. Throughout 1829, Jackson and his close advisor, William Berkeley Lewis, maintained cordial relations with B.U.S. administrators, including Biddle, and Jackson continued to do business with the B.U.S. branch bank in Nashville. The Second Bank's reputation in the public eye partially recovered throughout the 1820s as Biddle managed the Bank prudently during a period of economic expansion. Some of the animosity left over from the Panic of 1819 had diminished, though pockets of anti-B.U.S. sentiment persisted in some western and rural locales. According to historian Bray Hammond, \\"Jacksonians had to recognize that the Bank's standing in public esteem was high.\\" Unfortunately for Biddle, there were rumors that the Bank had interfered politically in the election of 1828 by supporting Adams. B.U.S. branch offices in Louisville, Lexington, Portsmouth, Boston, and New Orleans, according to anti-Bank Jacksonians, had loaned more readily to customers who favored Adams, appointed a disproportionate share of Adams men to the Bank's board of directors, and contributed Bank funds directly to the Adams campaign. Some of these allegations were unproven and even denied by individuals who were loyal to the President, but Jackson continued to receive news of the Bank's political meddling throughout his first term. To defuse a potentially explosive political conflict, some Jacksonians encouraged Biddle to select candidates from both parties to serve as B.U.S. officers, but Biddle insisted that only one's qualifications for the job and knowledge in the affairs of business, rather than partisan considerations, should determine hiring practices. In January 1829, John McLean wrote to Biddle urging him to avoid the appearance of political bias in light of allegations of the Bank interfering on behalf of Adams in Kentucky. Biddle responded that the \\"great hazard of any system of equal division of parties at a board is that it almost inevitably forces upon you incompetent or inferior persons in order to adjust the numerical balance of directors\\". By October 1829, some of Jackson‚Äôs closest associates, especially Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, were developing plans for a substitute national bank. These plans may have reflected a desire to transfer financial resources from Philadelphia to New York and other places. Biddle carefully explored his options for persuading Jackson to support recharter. He approached Lewis in November 1829 with a proposal to pay down the national debt. Jackson welcomed the offer and personally promised Biddle he would recommend the plan to Congress in his upcoming annual address, but emphasized that he had doubts as to the Bank's constitutionality. This left open the possibility that he could stymie the renewal of the Bank's charter should he win a second term. =Annual address to Congress, December 1829= In his annual address to Congress on December 8, 1829, Jackson praised Biddle's debt retirement plan, but advised Congress to take early action on determining the Bank's constitutionality and added that the institution had \\"failed in the great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency\\". He went on to argue that if such an institution was truly necessary for the United States, its charter should be revised to avoid constitutional objections. Jackson suggested making it a part of the Treasury Department. Many historians agree that the claim regarding the Bank‚Äôs currency was factually untrue. According to historian Robert V. Remini, the Bank exercised \\"full control of credit and currency facilities of the nation and adding to their strength and soundness\\". The Bank's currency circulated in all or nearly all parts of the country. Jackson's statements against the Bank were politically potent in that they served to \\"discharge the aggressions of citizens who felt injured by economic privilege, whether derived from banks or not\\". Jackson‚Äôs criticisms were shared by \\"anti-bank, hard money agrarians\\" as well as eastern financial interests, especially in New York City, who resented the central bank's restrictions on easy credit. They claimed that by lending money in large amounts to wealthy well-connected speculators, it restricted the possibility for an economic boom that would benefit all classes of citizens. After Jackson made these remarks, the Bank's stock dropped due to the sudden uncertainty over the fate of the institution. A few weeks after Jackson's address, Biddle began a multi-year, interregional public relations campaign designed to secure a new Bank charter. He helped finance and distribute thousands of copies of pro-B.U.S. articles, essays, pamphlets, philosophical treatises, stockholders' reports, congressional committee reports, and petitions. One of the first orders of business was to work with pro-B.U.S. Jacksonians and National Republicans in Congress to rebut Jackson's claims about the Bank's currency. A March 1830 report authored by Senator Samuel Smith of Maryland served this purpose. This was followed in April by a similar report written by Representative George McDuffie of South Carolina. Smith's report stated that the B.U.S. provided \\"a currency as safe as silver; more convenient, and more valuable than silver, which... is eagerly sought in exchange for silver\\". This echoed the arguments of Calhoun during the charter debates in 1816. After the release of these reports, Biddle went to the Bank's board to ask for permission to use some of the Bank's funds for printing and dissemination. The board, which was composed of Biddle and like-minded colleagues, agreed. Another result of the reports was that the Bank's stock rose following the drop that it experienced from Jackson's remarks. A alt=A thin older man uses a sword to attack a snake with multiple human heads representing different public figures In spite of Jackson's address, no clear policy towards the Bank emerged from the White House. Jackson‚Äôs cabinet members were opposed to an overt attack on the Bank. The Treasury Department maintained normal working relations with Biddle, whom Jackson reappointed as a government director of the Bank. Lewis and other administration insiders continued to have encouraging exchanges with Biddle, but in private correspondence with close associates, Jackson repeatedly referred to the institution as being \\"a hydra of corruption\\" and \\"dangerous to our liberties\\". Developments in 1830 and 1831 temporarily diverted anti-B.U.S. Jacksonians from pursuing their attack on the B.U.S. Two of the most prominent examples were the Nullification Crisis and the Peggy Eaton Affair. These struggles led to Vice President Calhoun's estrangement from Jackson and eventual resignation, the replacement of all of the original cabinet members but one, as well as the development of an unofficial group of advisors separate from the official cabinet that Jackson's opponents began to call his \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\". Jackson's Kitchen Cabinet, led by the Fourth Auditor of the Treasury Amos Kendall and Francis P. Blair, editor of the Washington Globe, the state- sponsored propaganda organ for the Jacksonian movement, helped craft policy, and proved to be more anti-Bank than the official cabinet. =Annual address to Congress, December 1830= In his second annual address to Congress on December 7, 1830, the president again publicly stated his constitutional objections to the Bank's existence. He called for a substitute national bank that would be wholly public with no private stockholders. It would not engage in lending or land purchasing, retaining only its role in processing customs duties for the Treasury Department. The address signaled to pro-B.U.S. forces that they would have to step up their campaign efforts. On February 2, 1831, while National Republicans were formulating a recharter strategy, Jacksonian Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri launched an attack against the legitimacy of the Bank on the floor of the Senate, demanding an open debate on the recharter issue. He denounced the Bank as a \\"moneyed tribunal\\" and argued for \\"a hard money policy against a paper money policy\\". After the speech was over, National Republican Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts called for a vote to end discussions on the Bank. It succeeded by a vote of 23 to 20, closer than he would have liked. According to Benton, the vote tally was \\"enough to excite uneasiness but not enough to pass the resolution\\". The Globe, which was vigorously anti-B.U.S., published Benton's speech, earning Jackson's praise. Shortly after, the Globe announced that the President intended to stand for reelection. Recharter =Post-Eaton cabinet and compromise efforts= After replacing most of his original cabinet members, Jackson included two Bank-friendly executives in his new official cabinet: Secretary of State Edward Livingston of Louisiana and Secretary of the Treasury Louis McLane of Delaware. alt=A dark-haired, partially bald man with a white shirt, white collar, and dark suit McLane, a confidant of Biddle, impressed Jackson as a forthright and principled moderate on Bank policy. Jackson called their disagreements an \\"honest difference of opinion\\" and appreciated McLane's \\"frankness\\". The Treasury Secretary's goal was to ensure that the B.U.S. survived Jackson‚Äôs presidency, even in a diminished condition. He secretly worked with Biddle to create a reform package. The product presented to Jackson included provisions through which the federal government would reduce operations and fulfill one of Jackson's goals of paying down the national debt by March 1833. The debt added up to approximately $24 million, and McLane estimated that it could be paid off by applying $8 million through the sale of government stock in the Bank plus an additional $16 million in anticipated revenue. The liquidation of government stock would necessitate substantial changes to the Bank's charter, which Jackson supported. After the liquidation of the debt, future revenues could be applied to funding the military. Another part of McLane's reform package involved selling government lands and distributing the funds to states, a measure consistent with Jackson's overall belief in reducing the operations of the central government. With this accomplished, the administration would permit re-authorization of the central bank in 1836. In return, McLane asked that Jackson not mention the Bank in his annual address to Congress. Jackson enthusiastically accepted McLane's proposal, and McLane personally told Biddle about his success. Biddle stated that he would have preferred that Jackson, rather than remaining silent on the question of recharter, would have made a public statement declaring that recharter was a matter for Congress to decide. Nonetheless, he agreed to the overall plan. These reforms required a rapprochement between Jackson and Biddle on the matter of recharter, with McLane and Livingston acting as liaisons. The President insisted that no bill arise in Congress for recharter in the lead up to his reelection campaign in 1832, a request to which Biddle assented. Jackson viewed the issue as a political liability‚Äîrecharter would easily pass both Houses with simple majorities‚Äîand as such, would confront him with the dilemma of approving or disapproving the legislation ahead of his reelection. A delay would obviate these risks. Jackson remained unconvinced of the Bank's constitutionality. =Annual address to Congress, December 1831= Jackson acceded to McLane's pleas for the upcoming annual address to Congress in December, assuming that any efforts to recharter the Bank would not begin until after the election. McLane would then present his proposals for reform and delay of recharter at the annual Treasury Secretary's report to Congress shortly thereafter. Despite McLane's attempts to procure a modified Bank charter, Attorney General Roger B. Taney, the only member of Jackson's cabinet at the time who was vehemently anti-B.U.S., predicted that ultimately Jackson would never relinquish his desire to destroy the central bank. Indeed, he was convinced that Jackson had never intended to spare the Bank in the first place. Jackson, without consulting McLane, subsequently edited the language in the final draft after considering Taney‚Äôs objections. In his December 6 address, Jackson was non-confrontational, but due to Taney's influence, his message was less definitive in its support for recharter than Biddle would have liked, amounting to merely a reprieve on the Bank‚Äôs fate. The following day, McLane delivered his report to Congress. The report praised the Bank‚Äôs performance, including its regulation of state banks, and explicitly called for a post-1832 rechartering of a reconfigured government bank. The enemies of the Bank were shocked and outraged by both speeches. The Jacksonian press, disappointed by the president‚Äôs subdued and conciliatory tone towards the Bank, launched fresh and provocative assaults on the institution. McLane‚Äôs speech, despite its call for radical modifications and delay in recharter, was widely condemned by Jacksonians. They described it as \\"Hamiltonian\\" in character, accused it of introducing \\"radical modifications\\" to existing Treasury policy and attacked it as an assault on democratic principles. For example, Representative Churchill C. Cambreleng wrote, \\"The Treasury report is as bad as it can possibly be‚Äîa new version of Alexander Hamilton's reports on a National Bank and manufacturers, and totally unsuited to this age of democracy and reform.\\" Secretary of the Senate Walter Lowrie described it as \\"too ultra federal\\". The Globe refrained from openly attacking Secretary McLane, but in lieu of this, reprinted hostile essays from anti-Bank periodicals. After this, McLane secretly tried to have Blair removed from his position as editor of the Globe. Jackson found out about this after Blair offered to resign. He assured Blair that he had no intention of replacing him. Troubled by accusations that he had switched sides, Jackson said, \\"I had no temporizing policy in me.\\" Although he did not fire McLane, he kept him at a greater distance. Taney's influence meanwhile continued to grow, and he became the only member of the President's official cabinet to be admitted to the inner circle of advisors in the Kitchen Cabinet. =National Republican Party offensive= alt=A brown-haired man with sideburns wearing a white shirt, white tie, and black suit National Republicans continued to organize in favor of recharter. Within days of Jackson's address, party members gathered at a convention on December 16, 1831, and nominated Senator Clay for president. Their campaign strategy was to defeat Jackson in 1832 on the Bank re- authorization issue. To that end, Clay helped introduce recharter bills in both the House and Senate. Clay and Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster warned Americans that if Jackson won reelection, he would abolish the Bank. They felt secure that the B.U.S. was sufficiently popular among voters that any attack on it by the President would be viewed as an abuse of executive power. The National Republican leadership aligned themselves with the Bank not so much because they were champions of the institution, but more so because it offered what appeared to be the perfect issue on which to defeat Jackson. Administration figures, among them McLane, were wary of issuing ultimatums that would provoke anti-B.U.S. Jacksonians. Biddle no longer believed that Jackson would compromise on the Bank question, but some of his correspondents who were in contact with the administration, including McDuffie, convinced the Bank president that Jackson would not veto a recharter bill. McLane and Lewis, however, told Biddle that the chances of recharter would be greater if he waited until after the election of 1832. \\"If you apply now,\\" McLane wrote Biddle, \\"you assuredly will fail,‚Äîif you wait, you will as certainly succeed.\\" Most historians have argued that Biddle reluctantly supported recharter in early 1832 due to political pressure from Clay and Webster, though the Bank president was also considering other factors. Thomas Cadwalader, a fellow B.U.S. director and close confidant of Biddle, recommended recharter after counting votes in Congress in December 1831. In addition, Biddle had to consider the wishes of the Bank's major stockholders, who wanted to avoid the uncertainty of waging a recharter fight closer to the expiration of the charter. Indeed, Jackson had predicted in his first annual message of 1829 that the Bank's stockholders would submit an early application to Congress. On January 6, 1832, bills for Bank recharter were introduced in both houses of Congress. In the House of Representatives, McDuffie, as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, guided the bill to the floor. Fellow Jacksonian George M. Dallas introduced the bill into the Senate. Clay and Webster secretly intended to provoke a veto, which they hoped would damage Jackson and lead to his defeat. They did however assure Biddle that Jackson would not veto the bill so close to the 1832 election. The proposals included some limited reforms by placing restrictions on the Bank's powers to own real estate and create new branches, give Congress the ability to prevent the Bank from issuing small notes, and allow the president to appoint one director to each branch of the Bank. =Jacksonian counter-offensive= The alliance between Biddle and Clay triggered a counter-offensive by anti-B.U.S. forces in Congress and the executive branch. Jackson assembled an array of talented and capable men as allies. Most notably, these were Thomas Hart Benton in the Senate and future president James K. Polk, member of the House of Representatives from Tennessee, as well as Blair, Treasury Auditor Kendall, and Attorney General Roger Taney in his cabinets. On February 23, 1832, Jacksonian Representative Augustin Smith Clayton of Georgia introduced a resolution to investigate allegations that the Bank had violated its charter. The intent was to put pro- Bank forces on the defensive. These delaying tactics could not be blocked indefinitely since any attempt to obstruct the inquiry would raise suspicions among the public. Many legislators benefited from the largesse supplied by Bank administrators. The plan was approved, and a bipartisan committee was sent to Philadelphia to look into the matters. Clayton's committee report, once released, helped rally the anti-Bank coalition. The months of delay in reaching a vote on the recharter measure served ultimately to clarify and intensify the issue for the American people. Jackson‚Äôs supporters benefited in sustaining these attacks on the Bank even as Benton and Polk warned Jackson that the struggle was \\"a losing fight\\" and that the recharter bill would certainly pass. Biddle, working through an intermediary, Charles Jared Ingersoll, continued to lobby Jackson to support recharter. On February 28, Cambreleng expressed hope that if the recharter bill passed, the President would \\"send it back to us with his veto‚Äîan enduring moment of his fame\\". The following day, Livingston predicted that if Congress passed a bill that Jackson found acceptable, the President would \\"sign it without hesitation\\". In the words of historian Bray Hammond, \\"This was a very large 'if,' and the secretary came to realize it.\\" Jackson decided that he had to destroy the Bank and veto the recharter bill. Many moderate Democrats, including McLane, were appalled by the perceived arrogance of the pro-Bank forces in pushing through early recharter and supported his decision. Indeed, Livingston was alone in the cabinet, for only he opposed a veto, and Jackson ignored him. Taney's influence grew immensely during this period, and Cambreleng told Van Buren that he was \\"the only efficient man of sound principles\\" in Jackson's official cabinet. Biddle traveled to Washington, D.C. to personally conduct the final push for recharter. For the past six months he had worked in concert with B.U.S. branch managers to elicit signatures from citizens for pro-B.U.S. petitions that would be aired in Congress. Congressmen were encouraged to write pro-Bank articles, which Biddle printed and distributed nationally. Francis Blair at the Globe reported these efforts by the B.U.S. president in the legislative process as evidence of the Bank‚Äôs corrupting influence on free government. After months of debate and strife, pro-B.U.S. National Republicans in Congress finally prevailed, winning reauthorization of the Bank's charter in the Senate on June 11 by a vote of 28 to 20. The House was dominated by Democrats, who held a 141‚Äì72 majority, but it voted in favor of the recharter bill on July 3 by a tally of 107 to 85. Many Northern Democrats joined the anti-Jacksonians in supporting recharter. The final bill sent to Jackson's desk contained modifications of the Bank's original charter that were intended to assuage many of the President's objections. The Bank would have a new fifteen-year charter; would report to the Treasury Department the names of all of the Bank's foreign stockholders, including the amount of shares they owned; would face stiff penalties if it held onto property for longer than five years, and would not issue notes in denominations of less than twenty dollars. Jacksonians argued that the Bank often cheated small farmers by redeeming paper with discounted specie, meaning that a certain amount was deducted. They alleged that this was unfair to farmers and allowed creditors to profit without creating tangible wealth, while a creditor would argue that he was performing a service and was entitled to profit from it. Biddle joined most observers in predicting that Jackson would veto the bill. Not long after, Jackson became ill. Van Buren arrived in Washington on July 4, and went to see Jackson, who said to him, \\"The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me, but I shall kill it.\\" Veto Contrary to the assurances Livingston had been rendering Biddle, Jackson determined to veto the recharter bill. The veto message was crafted primarily by members of the Kitchen Cabinet, specifically Taney, Kendall, and Jackson's nephew and aide Andrew Jackson Donelson. McLane denied that he had any part in it. Jackson officially vetoed the legislation on July 10, 1832, delivering a carefully crafted message to Congress and the American people. One of the most \\"popular and effective documents in American political history\\", Jackson outlined a major readjustment to the relative powers of the government branches. The executive branch, Jackson averred, when acting in the interests of the American people, was not bound to defer to the decisions of the Supreme Court, nor to comply with legislation passed by Congress. He believed that the Bank was unconstitutional and that the Supreme Court, which had declared it constitutional, did not have the power to do so without the \\"acquiesence of the people and the states\\". Further, while previous presidents had used their veto power, they had only done so when objecting to the constitutionality of bills. By vetoing the recharter bill and basing most of his reasoning on the grounds that he was acting in the best interests of the American people, Jackson greatly expanded the power and influence of the president. He characterized the B.U.S. as merely an agent of the executive branch, acting through the Department of the Treasury. As such, declared Jackson, Congress was obligated to consult the chief executive before initiating legislation affecting the Bank. Jackson had claimed, in essence, legislative power as president. Jackson gave no credit to the Bank for stabilizing the country's finances and provided no concrete proposals for a single alternate institution that would regulate currency and prevent over- speculation‚Äîthe primary purposes of the B.U.S. The practical implications of the veto were enormous. By expanding the veto, Jackson claimed for the president the right to participate in the legislative process. In the future, Congress would have to consider the president's wishes when deciding on a bill. alt=A partially bald black-haired man with large eyes stares directly out of the frame. He is wearing a white shirt, white collar, and black suit. The veto message was \\"a brilliant political manifesto\\" that called for the end of monied power in the financial sector and a leveling of opportunity under the protection of the executive branch. Jackson perfected his anti-Bank themes. He stated that one fifth of the Bank's stockholders were foreign and that, because states were only allowed to tax stock owned by their own citizens, foreign citizens could more easily accumulate it. He pitted the idealized \\"plain republican\\" and the \\"real people\\"‚Äîvirtuous, industrious and free‚Äîagainst a powerful financial institution‚Äîthe \\"monster\\" Bank, whose wealth was purportedly derived from privileges bestowed by corrupt political and business elites. Jackson's message distinguished between \\"equality of talents, of education, or of wealth\\", which could never be achieved, from \\"artificial distinctions\\", which he claimed the Bank promoted. Jackson cast himself in populist terms as a defender of original rights, writing: To those who believed that power and wealth should be linked, the message was unsettling. Daniel Webster charged Jackson with promoting class warfare. Webster was at around this time annually pocketing a small salary for his \\"services\\" in defending the Bank, although it was not uncommon at the time for legislators to accept monetary payment from corporations in exchange for promoting their interests. In presenting his economic vision, Jackson was compelled to obscure the fundamental incompatibility of the hard-money and easy credit wings of his party. On one side were Old Republican idealists who took a principled stand against all paper credit in favor of metallic money. Jackson's message criticized the Bank as a violation of states' rights, stating that the federal government's \\"true strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible to themselves.\\" Yet the bulk of Jackson‚Äôs supporters came from easy lending regions that welcomed banks and finance, as long as local control prevailed. By diverting both groups in a campaign against the central bank in Philadelphia, Jackson cloaked his own hard-money predilections, which, if adopted, would be as fatal to the inflation favoring Jacksonians as the B.U.S. was purported to be. Despite some misleading or intentionally vague statements on Jackson's part in his attacks against the Bank, some of his criticisms are considered justifiable by certain historians. It enjoyed enormous political and financial power, and there were no practical limits on what Biddle could do. It used loans and \\"retainer's fees\\", such as with Webster, to influence congressmen. It assisted certain candidates for offices over others. It also regularly violated its own charter. Senator George Poindexter of Mississippi received a $10,000 loan from the Bank after supporting recharter. Several months later, he received an additional loan of $8,000 despite the fact that the original loan had not been paid. This process violated the Bank's charter. Too late, Clay \\"realized the impasse into which he had maneuvered himself, and made every effort to override the veto\\". In a speech to the Senate, Webster rebuked Jackson for maintaining that the president could declare a law unconstitutional that had passed Congress and been approved by the Supreme Court. Immediately after Webster spoke, Clay arose and strongly criticized Jackson for his unprecedented expansion, or \\"perversion\\", of the veto power. The veto was intended to be used in extreme circumstances, he argued, which was why previous presidents had used it rarely if at all. Jackson, however, routinely used the veto to allow the executive branch to interfere in the legislative process, an idea Clay thought \\"hardly reconcilable with the genius of representative government\\". Benton replied by criticizing the Bank for being corrupt and actively working to influence the 1832 election. Clay responded by sarcastically alluding to a brawl that had taken place between Thomas Benton and his brother Jesse against Andrew Jackson in 1813. Benton called the statement an \\"atrocious calumny\\". Clay demanded that he retract his statements. Benton refused and instead repeated them. A shouting match ensued in which it appeared the two men might come to blows. Order was eventually restored and both men apologized to the Senate, although not to each other, for their behaviors. The pro-Bank interests failed to muster a supermajority‚Äîachieving only a simple majority of 22‚Äì19 in the Senate‚Äîand on July 13, 1832, the veto was sustained. The election of 1832 This cartoon, \\"alt=A man wearing a crown and thick robe holding a scepter stands over a pile of papers, one of which is marked as the \\"Constitution of the United States\\" Jackson's veto immediately made the Bank the main issue of the 1832 election. With four months remaining until the November general election, both parties launched massive political offensives with the Bank at the center of the fight. Jacksonians framed the issue as a choice between Jackson and \\"the People\\" versus Biddle and \\"the Aristocracy\\", while muting their criticisms of banking and credit in general. \\"Hickory Clubs\\" organized mass rallies, while the pro-Jackson press \\"virtually wrapped the country in anti-Bank propaganda\\". This, despite the fact that two-thirds of the major newspapers supported Bank recharter. The National Republican press countered by characterizing the veto message as despotic and Jackson as a tyrant. Presidential hopeful Henry Clay vowed \\"to veto Jackson\\" at the polls. Overall, the pro-Bank analysis tended to soberly enumerate Jackson's failures, lacking the vigor of the Democratic Party press. Biddle mounted an expensive drive to influence the election, providing Jackson with copious evidence to characterize Biddle as an enemy of republican government and American liberty through meddling in politics. Some of Biddle's aides brought this to his attention, but he chose not to take their advice. He also had tens of thousands of Jackson's veto messages circulated throughout the country, believing that those who read it would concur in his assessment that it was in essence \\"a manifesto of anarchy\\" addressed directly to a \\"mob\\". \\"The campaign is over, and I think we have won the victory\\", Clay said privately on July 21. Jackson's campaign benefited from superior organization skills. The first ever Democratic Party convention took place in May 1832. It did not officially nominate Jackson for president, but, as Jackson wished, nominated Martin Van Buren for vice president. Jackson's supporters hosted parades and barbecues, and erected hickory poles as a tribute to Jackson, whose nickname was Old Hickory. Jackson typically chose not to attend these events, in keeping with the tradition that candidates not actively campaign for office. Nevertheless, he often found himself swarmed by enthusiastic mobs. The National Republicans, meanwhile, developed popular political cartoons, some of the first to be employed in the nation. One such cartoon was entitled \\"King Andrew the First\\". It depicted Jackson in full regal dress, featuring a scepter, ermine robe, and crown. In his left hand he holds a document labelled \\"Veto\\" while standing on a tattered copy of the Constitution. Clay was also damaged by the candidacy of William Wirt of the Anti-Masonic Party, which took National Republican votes away in crucial states, mostly in the northeast. In the end, Jackson won a major victory with 54.6% of the popular vote, and 219 of the 286 electoral votes. In Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, Jackson won with absolutely no opposition. He also won the states of New Hampshire and Maine, fracturing the traditional Federalist/National Republican dominance in New England. The House also stood solidly for Jackson. The 1832 elections provided it with 140 pro-Jackson members compared to 100 anti-Jacksons. Jackson's dismantling of the B.U.S. =Renewal of war and 1832 address to Congress= Jackson regarded his victory as a popular mandate to eliminate the B.U.S. before its 20-year term ended in 1836. During the final phase of the 1832 election campaign, Kendall and Blair had convinced Jackson that the transfer of the federal deposits‚Äî20% of the Bank's capital‚Äîinto private banks friendly to the administration would be prudent. Their rationale was that Biddle had used the Bank's resources to support Jackson's political opponents in the 1824 and 1828 elections, and additionally, that Biddle might induce a financial crisis in retaliation for Jackson's veto and reelection. The President declared the Bank \\"Scotched, not dead\\". In his December 1832 State of the Union Address, Jackson aired his doubts to Congress whether the B.U.S. was a safe depository for \\"the people's money\\" and called for an investigation. In response, the Democratic-controlled House conducted an inquiry, submitting a divided committee report (4‚Äì3) that declared the deposits perfectly safe. The committee's minority faction, under Jacksonian James K. Polk, issued a scathing dissent, but the House approved the majority findings in March 1833, 109‚Äì46. Jackson, incensed at this \\"cool\\" dismissal, decided to proceed as advised by his Kitchen Cabinet to remove the B.U.S. funds by executive action alone. The administration was temporarily distracted by the Nullification Crisis, which reached its peak intensity from the fall of 1832 through the winter of 1833. With the crisis over, Jackson could turn his attention back to the Bank. =Search for a Treasury secretary= Kendall and Taney began to seek cooperative state banks which would receive the government deposits. That year, Kendall went on a \\"summer tour\\" in which he found seven institutions friendly to the administration in which it could place government funds. The list grew to 22 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Jackson sought to prepare his official cabinet for the coming removal of the Bank's deposits. Vice President Martin Van Buren tacitly approved the maneuver, but declined to publicly identify himself with the operation, for fear of compromising his anticipated presidential run in 1836. Treasury Secretary McLane balked at the removal, saying that tampering with the funds would cause \\"an economic catastrophe\\", and reminded Jackson that Congress had declared the deposits secure. Jackson subsequently shifted both pro-Bank cabinet members to other posts: McLane to the Department of State, and Livingston to Europe, as U.S. Minister to France. The President replaced McLane with William J. Duane, a reliable opponent of the Bank from Pennsylvania. Duane was a distinguished lawyer from Philadelphia whose father, also William Duane, had edited the Philadelphia Aurora, a prominent Jeffersonian newspaper. Duane's appointment, aside from continuing the war against the Second Bank, was intended to be a sign of the continuity between Jeffersonian ideals and Jacksonian democracy. \\"He's a chip of the old block, sir\\", Jackson said of the younger Duane. McLane met Duane in December 1832 and urged him to accept appointment as Treasury Secretary. He sent a letter of acceptance to Jackson on January 13, 1833, and was sworn in on June 1. By the time Duane was appointed, Jackson and his Kitchen Cabinet were well-advanced in their plan to remove the deposits. Despite their agreement on the Bank issue, Jackson did not seriously consider appointing Taney to the position. He and McLane had disagreed strongly on the issue, and his appointment would have been interpreted as an insult to McLane, who \\"vigorously opposed\\" the idea of Taney being appointed as his replacement. alt=A middle-aged man with light brown moderately long hair sits on a green chair beside a table covered with a green cloth. There are books on the table. There is a red curtain behind the man. Under the Bank charter terms of 1816, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury was empowered, with Congress, to make all decisions regarding the federal deposits. On his first day at his post, Secretary Duane was informed by Kendall, who was in name his subordinate in the Treasury Department, that Duane would be expected to defer to the President on the matter of the deposits. Duane demurred, and when Jackson personally intervened to explain his political mandate to ensure the Bank‚Äôs demise, his Treasury Secretary informed him that Congress should be consulted to determine the Bank's fate. Van Buren had cautiously supported McLane's proposal to delay the matter until January 1, 1834. Jackson declined. To Van Buren, he wrote, \\"Therefore to prolong the deposits until after the meeting of Congress would be to do the very act [the B.U.S.] wishes, that is, to have it in its power to distress the community, destroy the state Banks, and if possible to corrupt congress and obtain two thirds, to recharter the Bank.\\" Van Buren capitulated. Jackson's position ignited protest not only from Duane but also McLane and Secretary of War Lewis Cass. After weeks of clashing with Duane over these prerogatives, Jackson decided that the time had come to remove the deposits. On September 18, Lewis asked Jackson what he would do in the event that Congress passed a joint resolution to restore the deposits, Jackson replied, \\"Why, I would veto it.\\" Lewis then asked what he would do if Congress overrode his veto. \\"Under such circumstances,\\" he said, standing up, \\"then, sir, I would resign the presidency and return to the Hermitage.\\" The following day, Jackson sent a messenger to learn whether Duane had come to a decision. Duane asked to have until the 21st, but Jackson, wishing to act immediately, sent Andrew Donelson to tell him that this was not good enough, and that he would announce his intention to summarily remove the deposits the next day in Blair's Globe, with or without Duane's consent. Sure enough, the following day, a notice appeared in the Globe stating that the deposits would be removed starting on or before October 1. Secretary Duane had promised to resign if he and Jackson could not come to an agreement. When questioned by Jackson about this earlier promise, he said, \\"I indescreetly said so, sir; but I am now compelled to take this course.\\" Under attack from the Globe, Duane was dismissed by Jackson days later, on September 22, 1833. Two days later, McLane and Cass, feeling Jackson had ignored their advice, met with the President and suggested that they resign. They eventually agreed to stay on the condition that they would attend to their own departments and not say anything publicly which would bolster the Bank's standing. Attorney General Taney was immediately made Secretary of the Treasury in order to authorize the transfers, and he designated Kendall as special agent in charge of removal. With the help of Navy Secretary Levi Woodbury, they drafted an order dated September 25 declaring an official switch from national to deposit banking. Beginning on October 1, all future funds would be placed in selected state banks, and the government would draw on its remaining funds in the B.U.S. to cover operating expenses until those funds were exhausted. In case the B.U.S. retaliated, the administration decided to secretly equip a number of the state banks with transfer warrants, allowing money to be moved to them from the B.U.S. These were to be used only to counteract any hostile behavior from the B.U.S. =Removal of the deposits and panic of 1833‚Äì34= Taney, in his capacity as an interim treasury secretary, initiated the removal of the Bank's public deposits, spread out over four quarterly installments. Most of the state banks that were selected to receive the federal funds had political and financial connections with prominent members of the Jacksonian Party. Opponents referred to these banks derisively as \\"pet banks\\" since many of them financed pet projects conceived by members of the Jackson administration. Taney attempted to move tactfully in the process of carrying out the removals so as not to provoke retaliation by the B.U.S. or eviscerate the central bank's regulatory influence too suddenly. He presented five state-charted \\"pet\\" banks with drafts endorsed by the U.S. Treasury totaling $2.3 million. If Biddle presented any of the state banks with notes and demanded specie as payment, the banks could present him with the drafts to remove the deposits from the Bank and protect their liquidity. However, one of the banks drew prematurely on B.U.S. reserves for speculative ventures. At least two of the deposit banks, according to a Senate report released in July 1834, were caught up in a scandal involving Democratic Party newspaper editors, private conveyance firms, and elite officers in the Post Office Department. Jackson predicted that within a matter of weeks, his policy would make \\"Mr. Biddle and his Bank as quiet and harmless as a lamb\\". Biddle urged the Senate to pass joint resolutions for the restoration of the deposits. He planned to use \\"external pressure\\" to compel the House to adopt the resolutions. Clay demurred. Historian Ralph C.H. Catterall writes, \\"Just as in 1832 Biddle cared 'nothing for the campaign,' so in 1833 Henry Clay cared little or nothing for the bank.\\" Webster and John C. Calhoun, who was now a senator, broke away from Clay. Webster drafted a plan to charter the Bank for 12 years, which received support from Biddle, but Calhoun wanted a 6 year charter, and the men could not come to an agreement. In the end, Biddle responded to the deposit removal controversy in ways that were both precautionary and vindictive. On October 7, 1833, Biddle held a meeting with the Bank's board members in Philadelphia. There, he announced that the Bank would raise interest rates in the coming months in order to stockpile the Bank's monetary reserves. In addition, Biddle reduced discounts, called in loans, and demanded that state banks honor the liabilities they owed to the B.U.S. At least partially, this was a reasonable response to several factors that threatened the Bank's resources and continued profitability. Jackson's veto and the decreasing likelihood of obtaining a new federal charter meant that the Bank would soon have to wind up its affairs. Then there was the removal of the public deposits, congressional testimony indicating that the Jacksonians had attempted to sabotage the Bank's public image and solvency by manufacturing bank runs at branch offices in Kentucky, the responsibility of maintaining a uniform currency, the administration's goal of retiring the public debt in a short period, bad harvests, and expectations that the Bank would continue to lend to commercial houses and return dividends to stockholders. \\"This worthy President thinks that because he has scalped Indians and imprisoned Judges, he is to have his way with the Bank. He is mistaken\\", Biddle declared. Yet there was also a more punitive motivation behind Biddle's policies. He deliberately instigated a financial crisis to increase the chances of Congress and the President coming together in order to compromise on a new Bank charter, believing that this would convince the public of the Bank's necessity. In a letter to William Appleton on January 27, 1834, Biddle wrote: At first, Biddle's strategy was successful. As credit tightened across the country, businesses closed and men were thrown out of work. Business leaders began to think that deflation was the inevitable consequence of removing the deposits, and so they flooded Congress with petitions in favor of recharter. By December, one of the President's advisors, James Alexander Hamilton, remarked that business in New York was \\"really in very great distress, nay even to the point of General Bankruptcy \\". Calhoun denounced the removal of funds as an unconstitutional expansion of executive power. He accused Jackson of ignorance on financial matters. Jackson, however, believed that large majorities of American voters were behind him. They would force Congress to side with him in the event that pro-Bank congressmen attempted to impeach him for removing the deposits. Jackson, like Congress, received petitions begging him to do something to relieve the financial strain. He responded by referring them to Biddle. When a New York delegation visited him to complain about problems being faced by the state's merchants, Jackson responded saying: > Go to Nicholas Biddle. We have no money here, gentlemen. Biddle has all the > money. He has millions of specie in his vaults, at this moment, lying idle, > and yet you come to me to save you from breaking. I tell you, gentlemen, > it's all politics. The men took Jackson's advice and went to see Biddle, whom they discovered was \\"out of town\\". Biddle rejected the idea that the Bank should be \\"cajoled from its duty by any small driveling about relief to the country.\\" Not long after, it was announced in the Globe that Jackson would receive no more delegations to converse with him about money. Some members of the Democratic Party questioned the wisdom and legality of Jackson's move to terminate the Bank through executive means before its 1836 expiration. But Jackson's strategy eventually paid off as public opinion turned against the Bank. =Origins of the Whig Party and censure of President Jackson= By the spring of 1834, Jackson's political opponents‚Äîa loosely-knit coalition of National Republicans, anti-Masons, evangelical reformers, states' rights nullifiers, and some pro-B.U.S. Jacksonians‚Äîgathered in Rochester, New York to form a new political party. They called themselves Whigs after the British party of the same name. Just as British Whigs opposed the monarchy, American Whigs decried what they saw as executive tyranny from the president. Philip Hone, a New York merchant, may have been the first to apply the term in reference to anti- Jacksonians, and it became more popular after Clay used it in a Senate speech on April 14. \\"By way of metempsychosis,\\" Blair jeered, \\"ancient Tories now call themselves Whigs.\\" Jackson and Secretary Taney both exhorted Congress to uphold the removals, pointing to Biddle's deliberate contraction of credit as evidence that the central bank was unfit to store the nation's public deposits. The response of the Whig-controlled Senate was to try to express disapproval of Jackson by censuring him. Henry Clay, spearheading the attack, described Jackson as a \\"backwoods Caesar\\" and his administration a \\"military dictatorship\\". Jackson retaliated by calling Clay as \\"reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel\\". On March 28, Jackson was officially censured for violating the U.S. Constitution by a vote of 26‚Äì20. The reasons given were both the removal of the deposits and the dismissal of Duane. The opposing parties accused one another of lacking credentials to represent the people. Jacksonian Democrats pointed to the fact that Senators were beholden to the state legislatures that selected them; the Whigs pointing out that the chief executive had been chosen by electors, and not by popular vote. The House of Representatives, controlled by Jacksonian Democrats, took a different course of action. On April 4, it passed resolutions in favor of the removal of the public deposits. Led by Ways and Means Committee chairman James K. Polk, the House declared that the Bank \\"ought not to be rechartered\\" and that the deposits \\"ought not to be restored\\". It voted to continue allowing the deposit banks to serve as fiscal agents and to investigate whether the Bank had deliberately instigated the panic. Jackson called the passage of these resolutions a \\"glorious triumph\\", for it had essentially sealed the Bank's destruction. When House committee members, as dictated by Congress, arrived in Philadelphia to investigate the Bank, they were treated by the Bank's directors as distinguished guests. The directors soon stated, in writing, that the members must state in writing their purpose for examining the Bank's books before any would be turned over to them. If a violation of charter was alleged, the specific allegation must be stated. The committee members refused, and no books were shown to them. Next, they asked for specific books, but were told that it might take up to 10 months for these to be procured. Finally, they succeeded in getting subpoenas issued for specific books. The directors replied that they could not produce these books because they were not in the Bank's possession. Having failed in their attempt to investigate, the committee members returned to Washington. In Biddle's view, Jackson had violated the Bank's charter by removing the public deposits, meaning that the institution effectively ceased functioning as a central bank tasked with upholding the public interest and regulating the national economy. Thenceforth, Biddle would only consider the interests of the Bank's private stockholders when he crafted policy. When the committee members reported their findings to the House, they recommended that Biddle and his fellow directors be arrested for \\"contempt\\" of Congress, although nothing came of the effort. Nevertheless, this episode caused an even greater decline in public opinion regarding the Bank, with many believing that Biddle had deliberately evaded a congressional mandate. The Democrats did suffer some setbacks. Polk ran for Speaker of the House to replace Andrew Stevenson, who was nominated to be minister to Great Britain. After southerners discovered his connection to Van Buren, he was defeated by fellow Tennessean John Bell, a Democrat-turned-Whig who opposed Jackson's removal policy. The Whigs, meanwhile, began to point out that several of Jackson's cabinet appointees, despite having acted in their positions for many months, had yet to be formally nominated and confirmed by the Senate. For the Whigs, this was blatantly unconstitutional. The unconfirmed cabinet members, appointed during a congressional recess, consisted of McLane for Secretary of State, Benjamin F. Butler for Attorney General, and Taney for Secretary of the Treasury. McLane and Butler would likely receive confirmation easily, but Taney would definitely be rejected by a hostile Senate. Jackson had to submit all three nominations at once, and so he delayed submitting them until the last week of the Senate session on June 23. As expected, McLane and Butler were confirmed. Taney was rejected by a vote of 28‚Äì18. He resigned immediately. To replace Taney, Jackson nominated Woodbury, who, despite the fact that he also supported removal, was confirmed unanimously on June 29. Meanwhile, Biddle wrote to Webster successfully urging the Senate not to support Stevenson as minister. The Bank's final years =Demise of the Bank of the United States= The economy improved significantly in 1834. Biddle received heavy criticism for his contraction policies, including by some of his supporters, and was compelled to relax his curtailments. The Bank's Board of Directors voted unanimously in July to end all curtailments. The Coinage Act of 1834 passed Congress on June 28, 1834. It had considerable bipartisan support, including from Calhoun and Webster. The purpose of the act was to eliminate the devaluation of gold in order for gold coins to keep pace with market value and not be driven out of circulation. The first Coinage Act was passed in 1792 and established a 15 to 1 ratio for gold to silver coins. Commercial rates tended towards about 15.5-1. Consequentially a $10 gold eagle was really worth $10.66 and 2/3. It was undervalued and thus rarely circulated. The act raised the ratio to 16 to 1. Jackson felt that, with the Bank prostrate, he could safely bring gold back. It was not as successful as Jackson hoped. However, it did have a positive effect on the economy, as did good harvests in Europe. The result was that the recession that began with Biddle's contraction was brought to a close. For his part, Jackson expressed his willingness to recharter the Bank or establish a new one, but first insisted that his \\"experiment\\" in deposit banking be allowed a fair trial. Censure was the \\"last hurrah\\" of the Pro-Bank defenders and soon a reaction set in. Business leaders in American financial centers became convinced that Biddle's war on Jackson was more destructive than Jackson's war on the Bank. All recharter efforts were now abandoned as a lost cause. The national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the Bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. On January 1, 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished. The objective had been reached in part through Jackson's reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds, and through the veto of legislation he deemed extravagant. In December 1835, Polk defeated Bell and was elected Speaker of the House. alt=A very large man with dark hair and sideburns. He is wearing a white shirt, dark bow-tie, and dark suit. On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, tried to shoot Jackson with two pistols, both of which misfired. Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, and Lawrence was restrained and disarmed. Lawrence offered a variety of explanations for the shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the President dead, \\"money would be more plenty\\", (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank) and that he \\"could not rise until the President fell\\". Finally, Lawrence told his interrogators that he was a deposed English king‚Äîspecifically, Richard III, dead since 1485‚Äîand that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and was institutionalized. Jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies might have orchestrated the attempt on his life. His suspicions were never proven. In January 1837, Benton introduced a resolution to expunge Jackson's censure from the Senate record. It began nearly 13 consecutive hours of debate. Finally, a vote was taken, and it was decided 25‚Äì19 to expunge the censure. Thereafter, the Secretary of the Senate retrieved the original manuscript journal of the Senate and opened it to March 28, 1834, the day that the censure was applied. He drew black lines through the text recording the censure and beside it wrote: \\"Expunged by order of the Senate, this 16th day of January, 1837\\". Jackson proceeded to host a large dinner for the \\"expungers\\". Jackson left office on March 4 of that year and was replaced by Van Buren. Including when taking into account the recession engineered by Biddle, the economy expanded at an unprecedented rate of 6.6% per year from 1830 to 1837. In February 1836, the Bank became a private corporation under Pennsylvania commonwealth law. This took place just weeks before the expiration of the Bank's charter. Biddle had orchestrated the maneuver in a desperate effort to keep the institution alive rather than allowing it to dissolve. This managed to keep the Philadelphia branch operating at a price of nearly $6 million. In trying to keep the Bank alive, Biddle borrowed large sums of money from Europe and attempted to make money off the cotton market. Cotton prices eventually collapsed because of the depression (see below), making this business unprofitable. In 1839, Biddle submitted his resignation as Director of the B.U.S. He was subsequently sued for nearly $25 million and acquitted on charges of criminal conspiracy, but remained heavily involved in lawsuits until the end of his life. The Bank suspended payment in 1839. After an investigation exposed massive fraud in its operations, the Bank officially shut its doors on April 4, 1841. =Speculative boom and Panic of 1837= Jackson's destruction of the B.U.S. is believed by some to have helped set in motion a series of events that would eventually culminate in a major financial crisis known as the Panic of 1837. The origins of this crisis can be traced to the formation of an economic bubble in the mid-1830s that grew out of fiscal and monetary policies passed during Jackson's second term, combined with developments in international trade that concentrated large quantities of gold and silver in the United States. Among these policies and developments were the passage of the Coinage Act of 1834, actions pursued by Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, and a financial partnership between Biddle and Baring Brothers, a major British merchant banking house. British investment in the stocks and bonds that capitalized American transportation companies, municipal governments, and state governments added to this phenomenon. Woodbury ensured that banks' specie ratios remained consistent with those of the early 1830s. However, since lending was tied directly to the amount of gold and silver that banks stored in their vaults, the influx of precious metals into the United States encouraged American banks to print more paper money. The money supply and number of bank notes in circulation increased significantly in these years. State-chartered financial institutions, unshackled from the regulatory oversight previously provided by the B.U.S., started engaging in riskier lending practices that fueled a rapid economic expansion in land sales, internal improvement projects, cotton cultivation, and slavery. The federal government earned an average of about $2 million each year from land sales in the 1820s. This number increased to about $5 million in 1834, $15 million in 1835, and $25 million in 1836. In 1836, President Jackson signed the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred funds from the Treasury Department‚Äôs budget surplus into various deposit banks located in the interior of the country. The treasury secretary could no longer regulate lending requirements in the deposit banks as a result of this legislation. Soon afterward, Jackson signed the Specie Circular, an executive order mandating that sales of public lands in parcels over 320 acres be paid for only in gold and silver coin. Both of these measures diverted precious metals from the Atlantic Coast to western regions, leaving the nation‚Äôs financial centers vulnerable to external shocks. Another major problem was that bountiful crop harvests in cotton from the United States, Egypt, and India created a supply glut. The resulting drop in the price of cotton precipitated much of the damage of the financial panic. This is because cotton receipts not only gave value to many American credit instruments, but they were inextricably linked to the bubble then forming in the American Southwest (then centered in Louisiana and Mississippi). Southern planters bought large amounts of public land and produced more cotton to try to pay off their debts. The price of cotton steadily declined during Jackson's second term. In late 1836, the Bank of England began denying credit to American cotton producers. The Bank's directors raised interest rates from three to five percent and restricted some of the open trade practices that they had previously granted to American import merchants. The directors had grown alarmed that their specie reserves had dwindled to four million pounds, which they blamed on the purchase of American securities and poor harvests that forced England to import much of its food (if food imports created a trade deficit, this could lead to specie exports). Within months, cotton prices entered a full free-fall. In March 1837, Hermann, Briggs & Company, a major cotton commission house in New Orleans, declared bankruptcy, prompting the New York bill brokerage company, J.L. & S. Joseph & Company, to do the same. In May, New York banks suspended specie payments, meaning that they refused to redeem credit instruments in specie at full face value. Over the next several years, domestic trade slumped, the price of banking, railroad, and insurance company stocks declined, and unemployment rose. 194 of the 729 banks with charters closed their doors. Thousands of people in manufacturing districts lost their jobs as credit dried up. Farmers and planters suffered from price deflation and debt-default spirals. By the summer of 1842, eight states and the Florida territory had defaulted on their debts, which outraged international investors. Whigs and Democrats blamed each other for the crisis. The Whigs attacked Jackson's specie circular and demanded recharter of the Bank. Democrats defended the circular and blamed the panic on greedy speculators. Jackson insisted that the circular was necessary because allowing land to be purchased with paper would only fuel speculator greed more, thereby worsening the crisis. The circular, he claimed, was necessary to prevent excessive speculation. Legacy The Bank War far from settled the status of banking in the United States. Van Buren's solution to the Panic of 1837 was to create an Independent Treasury, where public funds would be managed by government officials without assistance from banks. A coalition of Whigs and conservative Democrats refused to pass the bill. It was not until 1840 that the Independent Treasury system was finally approved. When Whig candidate William Henry Harrison was elected in 1840, the Whigs, who also held a majority in Congress, repealed the Independent Treasury, intending to charter a new national bank. However, Harrison died after only a month in office, and his successor, John Tyler, vetoed two bills to reestablish the Bank. The nation returned to deposit banking. The Independent Treasury was recreated under the Polk presidency in 1846. The United States would never have another central banking system again until the Federal Reserve was established in 1913. The Bank War has proven to be a controversial subject in the scholarly community long after it took place. Quite a few historians over the years have proven to be either extremely celebratory or extremely critical of Jackson's war on the Bank. However, many agree that some sort of compromise to recharter the Bank with reforms to restrict its influence would have been ideal. 1930s Jackson biographer Marquis James commemorates Jackson's war against the Bank as the triumph of ordinary men against greedy and corrupt businessmen. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who wrote The Age of Jackson (1945), adopts a similar theme, celebrating Jacksonian democracy and representing it as the triumph of Eastern workers. Schlesinger portrays Jackson's economic program as a progressive precursor to the New Deal under Franklin D. Roosevelt. Robert V. Remini believes that the Bank had \\"too much power, which it was obviously using in politics. It had too much money which it was using to corrupt individuals. And so Jackson felt he had to get rid of it. It is a pity because we do need a national bank, but it requires control.\\" He refutes the idea that the collapse of the Bank was responsible for the Panic of 1837, which he describes as \\"a world-wide economic collapse\\", but concedes that it \\"may have exacerbated\\" the crisis. Richard Hofstadter accepts that the Bank had too much power to interfere in politics but excoriates Jackson for making war on it. \\"By destroying Biddle's Bank Jackson had taken away the only effective restraint on the wildcatters... he had strangled a potential threat to democratic government, but at an unnecessarily high cost. He had caused Biddle to create one depression and the pet banks to aggravate a second, and he had left the nation committed to a currency and credit system even more inadequate than the one he had inherited.\\" Hofstadter criticizes Schlesinger's contention that Jackson's program was a forerunner to the New Deal, arguing that the two were distinct because Jackson wanted less government involvement in finance and infrastructure, while Roosevelt wanted more. Hammond, in his Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War, renews the criticism of Schlesinger. He praises the Bank and Biddle's conduct, claiming that Jackson's war on it created a periodic of economic instability that would not be remedied until the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913. Historian Jon Meacham, in his 2008 biography of Jackson, concludes that the destruction of the Bank went against the country's interests. Daniel Walker Howe criticizes Jackson's hard money policies and claims that his war on the Bank \\"brought little if any benefit\\" to the common men who made up the majority of his supporters. In the end, he believes, the government was deprived of the stabilizing influence of a national bank and instead ended up with inflationary paper currency. \\"It was America's failure that the future of the national bank could have been resolved through compromise and a larger measure of government supervision\\", Howe writes. \\"Jackson and Biddle were both too headstrong for the country's good. The great Bank War turned out to be a conflict both sides lost.\\" References Bibliography                      * Further reading * Carpenter, Daniel, and Benjamin Schneer. \\"Party formation through petitions: The Whigs and the Bank War of 1832‚Äì1834.\\" Studies in American Political Development 29.2 (2015): 213‚Äì234.

Description The term buy-write is used because the investor buys stocks and writes call options against the stock position. The writing of the call option provides extra income for an investor who is willing to forego some upside potential. The BXM Index is designed to show the hypothetical performance of a strategy in which an investor buys a portfolio of the S&P; 500 stocks, and also sells (or writes) covered call options on the S&P; 500 Index. History Investors have used exchange-listed options to engage in buy-write strategies since the 1970s, but prior to 2002 there was no major benchmark for buy-write strategies. To develop the CBOE S&P; 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker BXM), the Chicago Board Options Exchange commissioned Professor Robert Whaley of Vanderbilt University. In April 2002, the index was announced with the publication of Whaley's \\"Return and Risk of CBOE Buy-Write Monthly Index\\" in Journal of Derivatives (Winter 2002). Investors have used covered call strategies for more than three decades. As noted in a magazine article ‚ÄúBuy Writing Makes Comeback as Way to Hedge Risk.‚Äù Pensions & Investments, (May 16, 2005), two developments have enhanced the interest in covered call strategies in recent years: (1) in 2002 the Chicago Board Options Exchange introduced the first major benchmark index for covered call strategies, the CBOE S&P; 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker BXM), and (2) in 2004 the Ibbotson Associates consulting firm published a case study on buy-write strategies. In 2006 Callan Associates published A Review of the CBOE S&P; 500 BuyWrite Index. The BXM Index won the Most Innovative Benchmark Index award at the 2004 Super Bowl of Indexing Conference.

Club career  Lee's foray as a professional footballer began with the Suwon Samsung Bluewings as a draftee, and he spent two seasons with the club without ever featuring in the K-League before departing for single season spells with Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i and Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma. A two-year stint at Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors followed. Despite spending six years at K-League clubs, Lee had still to establish himself as a first team regular, accumulating a mere 24 games in the K-League, with a few matches in Cup competitions. Lee then dropped out of the K-League ranks to spend the 2002 season with amateur side Seoul City FC before returning to the K-League with Daegu FC for their inaugural season in the K-League. He finally was able to consider himself as a regular starter in Daegu's side for the 2003 season, playing 22 matches in the K-League. However, the following season he fell out of favour and saw much less match play. By this time Chinese Super League side Sichuan Guancheng was showing interest in Lee's services, and he subsequently signed with the club for the 2004 season. He spent only a single season in China before returning to South Korea for a final season in the K-League with Daejeon Citizen.  Management career  After retiring as a player at the conclusion of the 2005 K-League season, Lee took up a coaching position with FC MB. MB means initial of Hong Myung-bo's given name.  International career  Lee was a member of the South Korea under-20 football team.

The sequels were written and directed by Antonio Passolini and did not have the same degree of popularity and cult appeal as the first film.  Plot  In the aftermath of nuclear apocalypse, 99% of the survivors are sex Negatives - they become violently ill if they attempt to have sex. The minority sex Positives are forced to engage in carnal theater for the entertainment of the Negatives at Caf√© Flesh. Everyone is excited about the arrival at the club of the famous Positive Johnny Rico, and one Negative woman is beginning to question her negativeness as she and her boyfriend grow more distant from each other. History By the early 1970s, the pornographic film industry had gained popularity, through the success of films such as Behind the Green Door and Deep Throat. During this period, there were many attempts to create artistic pornography, including The Devil in Miss Jones. There were also non- pornographic films with hardcore sex, such as I Am Curious (Yellow) and In the Realm of the Senses. By the early 1980s, home video technology shifted the porn industry, and pornography theaters were becoming less successful. In 1982, Caf√© Flesh, which mixed sex, satire, and avant-garde theater, was released. The film was created and co-written by Stephen Sayadian, under the name \\"Rinse Dream\\",\\"The Next Best Thing To Being There\\", by Robert Rossney, Wired 3.05, May 1995.

Ethanol fuel will have increased production from a current level of about per year (19 Gl/a, almost exclusively from corn) to over annually (76 Gl/a, mainly from cellulosic materials). Potentially of ethanol could be produced annually in a sustainable manner from domestic biomass resources. To achieve these goals some believe it will be necessary to develop and commercialize technology for the production of ethanol from cellulose and hemicellulose. Xethanol says it plans to increase production and profitability with new technology it has under development. Xylose Technologies, Inc. (XTI), a subsidiary of Xethanol, is conducting collaborative research through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. The work focuses on genetically engineering proprietary yeast strains for the efficient production of xylitol from xylose. Xylose, an abundant five carbon sugar found predominantly in hemicellulose of angiosperms, can be converted to xylitol through biochemical or chemical reduction. The USDA and other university research labs have hundreds of such CRADAs with many companies exploring the technology. History Xethanol was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2000 through a reverse merger with Zen Pottery Equipment. It is based in New York City and has operated two production facilities in Iowa since 2003. It began with the acquisition of Permeate Refining, Inc., and in 2004, Xethanol purchased a second plant which operates as Xethanol Biofuels, LLC. In early 2005 it acquired Superior Separation Technologies, Inc. from UTEK Corporation. It has announced plans to build new ethanol plants in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina through a newly formed subsidiary known as CoastalXethanol LLC. In August 2006, investors and scientists following Xethanol's progress were disturbed by a series of accusations brought against Xethanol on a website called ShareSleuth.com. Follow-up articles appearing in theStreet.com reiterated the story and claimed that it was difficult for reporters and stock analysts to get information from Xethanol officials. A Soleil Securities alternative energy analyst cut Xethanol's rating to \\"Sell-target $1.53\\" from \\"Hold-target $10\\" after he became disillusioned by the response from Xethanol. The analyst had been trying to obtain information from Xethanol for institutions interested in investing. The ShareSleuth article revealed that people connected with the Xethanol's secondary stock offering had been sanctioned by the SEC and that the resume of Xethanol's chief executive officer, Christopher D'Arnaud Taylor had been inflated. In response, D'Arnaud Taylor, as well as several of his associates who dominated the company's board of directors, resigned or took less prominent roles. The ShareSleuth article pointed out that one of the company's smaller facilities was shuttered and rusting. The company noted that it had not been operational when they purchased it, and that it was intended for use in pilot development operations. However, there was no explanation why company officials suggested in interviews that the facility was in use, and later that \\"it is being renovated as we speak.\\" This rapid increase in Xethanol's stock price could be attributed largely to President Bush's 2006 State of the Union Address on January 31 in which he announced that the administration was undertaking a major new effort to develop technology for the production of \\"cellulosic ethanol\\" from agricultural materials such as switchgrass. This speech was followed the next day by an announcement from the Department of Energy that it would be funding 40% of the capital costs of two large (700 ton per day) cellulosic ethanol demonstration plants. Even though there are about five companies currently working on production of ethanol from cellulose, Xethanol was virtually the only company public at the time. Within days, its stock price shot up to $6 per share. Even though much of the population had never heard of switch grass, the idea of a renewable source of energy sparked their interest. Xethanol's small capitalization combined with a public anxious about rising petroleum costs and global warming drove Xethanol's run-up in price. The decrease in share price‚Äîalong with falling share prices of other companies associated with ethanol production‚Äîfollowed as investors began to realize the technological differences between making ethanol from corn starch or sugar cane and making it from cellulose. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in September 2006, Xethanol acknowledged that it was not as close to the breakthrough technology as previously represented. The value of the technologies it had purchased were written down as an accounting measure, and Xethanol also warned that it did not have the financing to complete its previously announced plans. Renaming and bankruptcy On August 28, 2008, Xethanol relaunched itself as Global Energy Holdings Group, Inc., with the intention to diversify away from ethanol to other alternative fuels including woody biomass, orange peels, and methane from landfills. By September, 2009, Global Energy Holdings had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Background  NBCI initially opened in January 2003 as an extension of the earlier adjacent Western Correctional Institution, with full independent operation beginning in the summer 2008 with the completion of housing unit construction. Final construction costs amounted to more than $175 million. In 2011, operating costs totaled $50,613,215 for 1,471 inmates, equating to approximately $34,407 per inmate per year. With 555 employees as of 2011, NBCI is the eighth-largest employer in Allegany County.  Security and safety  Since the closure of the Maryland House of Correction in Jessup, Maryland in 2007 NBCI has housed the most serious offenders within the state of Maryland, including death row inmates (before the death penalty sentences were commuted to LWOP following Maryland's abolition of the death penalty). At the time of its construction, NBCI was one of the most technologically advanced prisons in the world, and was the first of its kind in the United States. The prison was constructed using an \\"inverted fortress\\" style of building placement, with a master control tower sitting in the middle of a complex that is ringed with housing units and support structures. The control tower is designed for maximum oversight with minimum staffing, requiring only two officers to maintain the entire security system. It has an unobstructed view of the entire grounds, as well as a complete surveillance of every area accessed by inmates. Additionally, the tower has control over all security doors, cameras, and even the flow of water into individual cells. Instead of one large cell block, the prison features separate housing blocks all zoned and protected so the movement of inmates is eased reducing the risk of riots and violence. Four units of 256 cells house the inmate population. Each cell is just over 60 square feet and is constructed of cast concrete that prevents seams in construction in which to hide contraband. Cell door windows are made of ballistic-resistant glass to allow easier observation and enhance officer safety. The cell's furnishings are relatively minimal. The beds are bolted directly into the concrete and the bolts are rounded down so the inmates cannot remove them to use the beds to ram the doors. The toilets and sinks are brushed stainless steel instead of porcelain to avoid porcelain shards being broken off and being made into weapons. The piping behind the fixtures is also reinforced so if an inmate were to remove the fixture, they cannot escape and even if they could successfully tunnel through they would end up in the plumbing box which has a similar cell door. The cell doors are by far the most evolved feature of the prison as opposed to the classic cell bar doors. The doors feature micro- perforations to allow corrections officers to speak with inmates and vice versa. The cell doors also have small slots that can be opened to provide meals to inmates perceived to be too dangerous to be let out to the dining area; and to handcuff the inmates before exiting providing corrections officers maximum control over inmate movement. The door frames are filled with concrete to prevent tampering. The walls of the cells are coated with a high grade epoxy paint resistant to scratching, chipping and even acid. The perimeter consists of fifteen miles of inwardly-curved razor wire and motion sensors, as well as regular patrols and fence inspections. Trained dogs are used to find illicit materials, including cell phones.  Notable incidents  In March 2008, several inmates were injured in what was deemed excessive use of force at NBCI. These inmates had allegedly been assaulted by North Branch staff shortly after transfer to the facility from nearby Roxbury Correctional Institution after being uncooperative and violent towards RCI officers. This incident led to six NBCI officers being fired and assault charges being filed. Several homicides have occurred since operations began. On February 10, 2013, an inmate was found dead in his cell in what was described as an apparent homicide. An inmate's death in January at a Baltimore hospital was ruled a homicide. The inmate had been assaulted by another inmate at NBCI the previous November. An inmate was found dead in his cell on September 27, 2012, after an apparent strangulation. This led to the indictment of his cellmate on murder charges in January 2013. On December 8, 2011, an inmate was found unresponsive in his cell. His death was ruled a homicide by strangulation. On Monday May 8, 2013, an inmate stabbed a correctional officer several times in the head, neck and upper torso at around 8:40 am. Officials with the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services said the officer, who is in his 30s and a four-year DPSCS veteran, was taken by ambulance to Western Maryland Regional Medical Center with non-life threatening injuries.http://www.your4state.com/story/officer-stabbed-at-north-branch- correctional-institution/d/story/jAyWys2uQ0qPBT6s_iCzTg  In popular culture  NBCI has been featured on the television programs MegaStructures, Big, Bigger, Biggest, and Lockdown.

Founded by Hildegard of Bingen in 1165, it was dissolved in 1804, but restored, with new buildings, in 1904. The nuns produce wine and crafts. They can be heard singing their regular services, which have been at times recorded. The church is also used as a concert venue. The abbey is a Rhine Gorge World Heritage Site.  History  The original community was founded in 1165 by Hildegard of Bingen. This was the second community founded by her. It was disestablished in 1804. After the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss (German mediatization), the land once owned by the convent became part of the domains of the prince of Nassau-Weilburg who, in 1831, even bought both the monastery and its church. The community was reestablished by Charles, 6th Prince of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg in 1904 and resettled from St. Gabriel's Abbey, Bertholdstein. The nunnery belongs to the Beuronese Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation. A new building was erected in Neo-Romanesque style. In 1941, the nuns were expelled by the Nazis; they were not able to return until 1945. In 1988, the sisters founded Marienrode Priory at Hildesheim, which became independent of Eibingen in 1998. The nuns work in the vineyard and in the craft workshops, besides undertaking the traditional duties of hospitality. A visitor watched the nuns using GPS systems, computers and modern kitchen tools. They can be heard (but not seen) singing their regular services. The nuns have recorded their Vespers. A first recording was made in 1973 and contained only two works by Hildegard of Bingen, a Kyrie and O virga ac diadema. A second recording appeared in 1979, to remember the 800th anniversary of Hildegard's death, including the same pieces and antiphones, a hymn, a responsory and parts of Ordo virtutum. In 1989, a third recording appeared, conducted by P. Johannes Berchmans G√∂schl, a scholar of Gregorian chant. A reviewer of Gramophone noted about a 1998 recording: \\"These nuns are living the same life as that of Hildegard's community, singing daily the same Benedictine Office, breathing the same air and trying to capture the spirit of their great twelfth-century predecessor.\\"  Abbesses  * Hildegard of Bingen (1098‚Äì1179), first abbess and founder of the community Statue of Hildegard of Bingen, bronze by Karlheinz Oswald (1998) From 1603 the abbesses held the title of \\"Abbess of Rupertsberg and Eibingen\\". * Kunigunde Frey von Dehrn, abbess around 1600 * Anna Lerch von Dirmstein, abbess until 1666 * Kunigunde Sch√ºtz von Holtzhausen, abbess from 1666 to 1669 * Scholastica von Manteuffel, abbess from 1670 * Maria Antonetta M√ºhl zu Ulmen, abbess from 1711 Philippine zu Guttenberg, last abbess of the convent prior to the German mediatization * Philippine zu Guttenberg, last abbess from 1790 to 1804.

The film was released in the United States on December 22, 1995. Set at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, the film was written by Gene Quintano, based on a story by Karen Elise Baldwin, the wife of then-Pittsburgh Penguins owner Howard Baldwin, who was a co-producer. It was the second collaboration between Van Damme and Hyams, after Timecop (1994). The film grossed $64 million at the box office on a $35 million budget and received mixed reviews at the time of its release, although retrospective reviews have been more positive and it is seen by many as one of Van Damme's best. Plot Darren McCord is a French Canadian-born firefighter for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire now serving as the fire marshal for the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, after being unable to save a young girl from a house fire two years prior. During the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks (a fictional rematch of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals), a group of terrorists take the Vice President of the United States and several other VIPs hostage in a luxury suite. Former CIA operative Joshua Foss has the arena wired with explosives, and plans to blow it up at the end of the game, while having hundreds of millions of dollars wired into several off shore accounts. Darren takes his son Tyler and daughter Emily to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals as a birthday gift for Tyler. A spat between brother and sister causes Emily to run off before getting kidnapped by Carla, the sole female member of the terrorists (who is disguised as the local mascot Iceburgh after killing the original performer). Carla places Emily in the suite with the other hostages about to be executed. Not wanting his son to go missing, Darren orders Tyler to stay in his seat while he goes searching for Emily. Carla is about to kill Darren, but he evades her attacks in a fight and kills her. Afterward, Darren asks for a security guard's help, but the guard is another terrorist in disguise and reveals their criminal operation before being killed by Darren. Now aware of the situation, Darren finds a mobile phone in the executive offices and uses it to contact Secret Service Agent Matthew Hallmark; Hallmark advises Darren to stand by while the agents take charge. He angrily refuses, saying that he will handle this himself. The Secret Service and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police team up to surround the arena and a standoff ensues. Meanwhile, Darren manages to find and disarm a few of the bombs (as well as killing and evading a few of Foss' men), whilst Foss himself kills several hostages after the end of the first and second periods. Hallmark finally makes his way inside and meets Darren, who explains where the rest of the bombs are most likely located. Hallmark is revealed to be in league with Foss, and tries to kidnap Tyler, but fails. Hallmark then reveals his true self to Darren, who sets him on fire and ultimately kills him. Darren then uses Hallmark's phone to contact Foss, who taunts that he is holding his daughter captive. As time ticks down, Darren disables more bombs, but is severely slowed by confrontations with Foss' men. At one point, Darren, dressed as the Pittsburgh goalie to escape the thugs, enters the game and successfully defends a shot on goal. As the third period runs down, Luc Robitaille scores the game-tying goal for Pittsburgh in the last second, prompting sudden death overtime and prolonging the game. Deciding that there's no time left to find the remaining bombs, Darren climbs to the roof of the arena. He fights off two of Foss' henchmen; one of them falls onto the score display, blowing it up. As the arena erupts into chaos, Darren advances upon the owner's box from above and forces his way in, rescuing Emily, the Vice President and the remaining hostages. Darren and Emily reunite with Tyler and set out to leave the arena. Foss manages to escape and blend in with the panicking crowd. He sets off one of the bombs, flooding part of the arena, and recaptures Emily when she recognizes him. They head towards the top of the arena, where a helicopter is waiting to lift Foss away. Darren intervenes and saves his daughter before Foss could shoot her. As Foss attempts to flee, Darren shoots the pilot, causing the chopper to stall and fall into the arena, sending a screaming Foss to his death as the chopper explodes on impact with the ice. Darren is led to an awaiting Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS medic unit while his children tell the paramedics of his heroism. As a contented Darren is loaded into the ambulance, it is presumed that he was restored back to his position.

Howard Baldwin, chairman of the Pittsburgh Penguins, was one of the film's backers. He had a two-year deal with Universal. Baldwin wanted to use footage from the October 1 game opener between Pittsburgh and Chicago, but the game was delayed due to a lockout. He arranged an exhibition game, but the players from Pittsburgh and Chicago apparently did not display the correct intensity. So they arranged another game involving players from the Johnstown Chiefs and Wheeling Thunderbirds of the East Coast Hockey League (now ECHL). Crowd shots were done over one night using between 2,000 and 3,000 extras, plus cardboard cut outs to make the stadium seem like 17,000. Sudden Death was filmed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it is set, and Middletown, New York, in 98 days between August 29 and December 7, 1994. Parts were filmed at the then-unopened and now closed Veterans Hospital in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania.DVD production notes. The final helicopter crash was filmed with a 400 ft crane that could pick up and lower the helicopter into the arena. Nine cameras recorded the event, which was filmed several times, and hundreds of emergency vehicles were on standby in case of an accident. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 5.11/10. The website's consensus states \\"Sudden Death may not be a classic, but exciting set pieces and strong work from Jean- Claude Van Damme help this action thriller pay off part of its Die Hard debt.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two and half stars out of four and stated that, \\"Sudden Death isn't about common sense. It's about the manipulation of action and special-effects sequences to create a thriller effect, and at that it's pretty good.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"A treat for Jean-Claude Van Damme fans, a superior action thriller loaded with jaw-dropping stunts and special effects, and strong in production values.\\" TVGuide gave it 2 out of 4 calling it \\"Good clean fun, with just the right ratio of explosions to dialogue.\\" Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly said the film wants to be a \\"comical Die Hard knockoff\\" but criticizes the director for the \\"inept editing and a plodding pace\\". He gave it a D- grade. In 2013 Den of Geek included it at 5 in a list of the Top 10 Van Damme movies. =Box office= Sudden Death opened in the United States on the weekend of December 22, 1995, in eighth place, making $4,782,445 at 1681 theaters, with a poor $2,845 per screen average, and a $20,350,171 final tally. Internationally it fared better, with a worldwide gross of nearly $64 million. In other countries, it made close to 50 million in profit with video sales. Novelization The novelization of the film was written by American writer Stephen Mertz. The audio book is read by Powers Boothe. Remake On August 20, 2019, it was reported that a Remake titled Welcome to Sudden Death, was in production from both Universal 1440 and Netflix, originally set for a June 2020 release date.

More simply it is the property of having life. The perception of vitality is regarded as a basic psychological drive and, in philosophy, a component to the will to live. As such, people seek to maximize their vitality or their experience of vitality‚Äîthat which corresponds to an enhanced physiological capacity and mental state.  Overview  The pursuit and maintenance of health and vitality have been at the forefront of medicine and natural philosophy throughout history. Life depends upon various biological processes known as vital processes. As such, vitality is also the characteristic distinction of living from non-living things. Historically, these vital processes have been viewed as having either mechanistic or non-mechanistic causes. The latter of which is characteristic of vitalism, the doctrine that the phenomena of life cannot be explained by purely chemical and physical mechanisms. Prior to the 19th century, theoreticians often held that human lifespan had been less limited in the past, and that aging was due to a loss of, and failure to maintain, vitality. A commonly held view was that people are born with finite vitality, which diminishes over time until illness and debility set in, and finally death.  Religion  In traditional cultures, the capacity for life is often directly equated with the or . This can be found in the Hindu concept , where vitality in the body derives from a subtle principle in the air and in food, as well as in Hebrew and ancient Greek texts. = Jainism =  See also  * Jƒ´vitindriya * Vitalism  References  Jain philosophical concepts Natural philosophy Philosophy of life Quality of life ","title":"Vitality"},{"id":"4021186","text":"View of the priory. Church and fishpond. Saint Cosmas and Damian Chapel. Marienrode Priory is a Benedictine nunnery in Marienrode, a district of Hildesheim in Germany. An Augustinian monastery was founded here in 1125 by the Bishop of Hildesheim, Berthold I von Alvensleben, in a place then known as Baccenrode. It lasted until 1259. The site was re-settled later, at first by Augustinians and afterwards as a Cistercian monastery. The Cistercians gave the community its current name of Marienrode which has officially been used since 1439. The foundation stone of the present church was laid in 1412. The church was built in gothic style with three naves and completed in 1462. The Baroque ridge turret was added in the 18th century. In the church, there are two noteworthy baroque altars dating from 1750 approximately and a gothic sandstone sculpture of Saint Mary which was made in 1460. The organ dates from the middle of the 18th century. Most of the present buildings of the monastery consisting of sandstone were built in the 18th century. In the inner court there is a noteworthy pigeon tower. After the secularization of 1806, the monastery was used as a farm until 1987. A small chapel of the priory, Saint Cosmas and Damian, which was built in 1792 was converted into a small Protestant church in 1830. It is not only used by the Protestants living in Marienrode, but also by those from Neuhof and Hildesheimer Wald, two districts of Hildesheim which do not have churches. The altar dates from 1835 and the organ from the end of the 18th century. According to Cistercian tradition, the chapel has a ridge turret instead of a tower. From 1983, the new Bishop of Hildesheim, Josef Homeyer, was active in the re-establishment of monastic houses. As a result, Marienrode Priory was re-settled by ten Benedictine nuns from Eibingen Abbey on 5 May 1988. Since 1998, Marienrode has been an independent priory within the Beuronese Congregation. Around the priory, a small village (Marienrode) developed which was incorporated into Hildesheim in 1974. The former village school which was operated by the priory was built in 1716. The windmill of Marienrode was built in 1839 and used as such until 1939. From the village it can be reached through a tree-lined avenue consisting of 200-year-old lindens, with a historic pavement. The large fishpond in the South of the village was laid out by the Cistercians in the Middle Ages.

The smallest portion of DNA that can be isolated using this method comprises 10 million base pairs - hundreds or thousands of individual genes. Scientists who study chromosomes are known as cytogeneticists. They are able to identify each chromosome based on its unique pattern of dark and light bands. Certain abnormalities, however, cause chromosomes to have unusual banding patterns. For example, one chromosome may have a piece of another chromosome inserted within it, creating extra bands. Or, a portion of a chromosome may be repeated over and over again, resulting in an unusually wide, dark band (known as a homogeneously staining region). Some chromosomal aberrations have been linked to cancer and inherited genetic disorders, and the chromosomes of many tumor cells exhibit irregular bands. To understand more about what causes these conditions, scientists hope to determine which genes and DNA sequences are located near these unusual bands. Chromosome microdissection is a specialized way of isolating these regions by removing the DNA from the band and making that DNA available for further study. To prepare cells for chromosome microdissection, a scientist first treats them with a chemical that forces them into metaphase: a phase of the cell's life-cycle where the chromosomes are tightly coiled and highly visible. Next, the cells are dropped onto a microscope slide so that the nucleus, which holds all of the genetic material together, breaks apart and releases the chromosomes onto the slide. Then, under a microscope, the scientist locates the specific band of interest, and, using a very fine needle, tears that band away from the rest of the chromosome. The researcher next produces multiple copies of the isolated DNA using a procedure called PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The scientist uses these copies to study the DNA from the unusual region of the chromosome in question.

Marion Crawford, first published as a serial in Blackwood's Magazine and then as a book in New York (Macmillan) and Edinburgh (Blackwood) in 1887. Set chiefly in Rome of twenty years earlier, the novel paints a rich picture of the period, detailing the spiritual and economic problems of the aristocracy at a time when its influence and status were under attack from the emerging forces of modernity. This romance tells the tale of Giovanni Saracinesca and his courting of Corona d'Astradente, complete with intrigue and sword fights (Crawford was an expert fencer). It can be categorized as a work of historical fiction in that it relates a time when the author was only a child, and also in the sense that the particulars of that time and place are carefully delineated. In a sense, Crawford had been researching for this book all his life: his parents had witnessed the brief 1848 revolution, and his cousin, in her memoirs of Crawford, insisted that \\"[t]here is little doubt that Crawford as a boy had heard first-hand descriptions of [the] exciting events\\" of the 1860s. Saracinesca proved to be both an immediate hit and Crawford's greatest critical success. It was also a commercial triumph: he negotiated separate contracts for the serial printing and the simultaneous American and British publication, as well as future royalties. He followed it with two brilliant sequels, Sant' Ilario and Don Orsino, the three of which are usually considered a trilogy. Subsequent sequels, such as Corleone, continue the saga of Saracinesca family, but with a diversion from the previous focus on the drama and status of family members into heavily plotted, incident-heavy melodrama. Characters from Saracinesca and its sequels also appear in A Lady of Rome (1906) and The White Sister (1909). Crawford, though an American by parentage and citizenship, was born in the Italian resort of Bagni de Lucca, spent most of his life abroad, and wrote Saracinesca while living in Sant' Agnello di Sorrento, Italy.

The highway extends from CR 509 in Westfield to Route 23 and Bloomfield Avenue (CR 506) in Verona. Route description View of CR 577 near Route 124 in Springfield CR 577 begins at the intersection of Springfield Avenue and East Broad Street (both part of CR 509) in the northern reaches of Westfield. The county road first heads northwest on Springfield Avenue but then curves to the north-northeast. After passing mostly residential neighborhoods, it passes the entrance to the Echo Lake Country Club. The road crosses the Nomahegan Brook and crosses partially into Mountainside then fully into Springfield Township where it passes businesses and apartment complexes. After an interchange with U.S. Route 22 (US 22), CR 577 proceeds further into Springfield Township passing houses, schools, and small businesses. The road name changes to Meisel Avenue and then approaches a complex intersection with Route 82 (its western terminus) and Route 124, both of which carry Morris Avenue. CR 577 has a brief concurrency with Route 124 through the traffic circle-like intersection where Maple Avenue carries the nominal route northbound while Meisel Avenue carries the southbound traffic. From this intersection, the route heads north as two- lane undivided Main Street. After crossing over Interstate 78 (I-78), the road enters Millburn, Essex County where the road becomes municipally maintained. The road runs through suburban residential developments. In Millburn, CR 577 reaches a junction with CR 527, at which point the route turns east onto a one-way pair that is county maintained. Northbound CR 577 follows three-lane Millburn Avenue and southbound CR 577 follows two-lane Essex Avenue on this pairing, which passes through the commercial downtown of Millburn. At the end of the one-way pair, the route becomes four-lane undivided Millburn Avenue and continues east through a mix of homes and businesses. At the Wyoming Avenue intersection, CR 577 turns northeast onto that road while CR 630 continues along Millburn Avenue. Wyoming Avenue, which is a two-lane road, carries the route over New Jersey Transit‚Äôs Morristown Line and into wooded residential neighborhoods a short distance to the east of the South Mountain Reservation. The road continues through Maplewood before crossing into South Orange, where it reaches CR 510. At this point, CR 577 turns east to form a brief concurrency with CR 510, which is four-lane South Orange Avenue. Upon splitting from that route, CR 577 continues northeast on two-lane Wyoming Avenue. The road enters West Orange and becomes Gregory Avenue. Here, the route crosses CR 508 prior to reaching the CR 660 junction. CR 577 northbound past CR 508 in West Orange At CR 660, CR 577 turns north onto Mt. Pleasant Avenue and crosses First Watchung Mountain as the road makes a turn to the west. This road is four lanes at first, soon narrowing to two lanes. After crossing the mountain, the route intersects Prospect Avenue, which it turns north onto. At this intersection, Prospect Avenue heads south as CR 677 while Mt. Pleasant Avenue continues west as Route 10. Along Prospect Avenue, CR 577 is a two-lane undivided road that turns into a four-lane divided highway as it passes through commercial areas. The route comes to an interchange with I-280 and becomes a five-lane undivided road past that point, with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. At the CR 611 intersection, CR 577 becomes three lanes with two lanes southbound and one lane northbound The road runs between homes and the Montclair Golf Course to the west and the Eagle Rock Reservation to the east before becoming two lanes and crossing into Verona. In Verona, CR 577 passes residences before reaching its end at an intersection with CR 506. Past this intersection, the road continues north as Route 23. History CR 577 Spur signed at the junction of CR 577 and Route 10 in West Orange A spur route, County Route 577 Spur, existed, which is now Essex County Route 677, however some newer signage along the road has brought back the CR 577 Spur designation. The portion of CR 577 south of Route 124 was previously part of CR 509 Spur. Though the CR 509 Spur designation was officially designated on this section by the state until 2019, CR 577 signage appeared on this section of road prior to then.

A member of the Democratic Party, he represented in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011 and was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in 2010. A three-star vice admiral, he was the highest-ranking military official ever elected to the United States Congress at the time of his election. He was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, launching his campaign on June 23, 2019 and ending it on December 1, 2019, subsequently endorsing Amy Klobuchar. Graduating second in his class at the United States Naval Academy, Sestak served in the United States Navy for over 31 years and rose to the rank of three-star admiral. He served as the Director for Defense Policy on the National Security Council staff under President Bill Clinton and held a series of operational commands, including commanding the USS George Washington carrier strike group during combat operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean in 2002. Sestak was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006 in a heavily Republican district, and reelected in 2008 by a 20% margin. He declined to run for reelection in 2010, instead running for the Senate. In the Democratic primary he defeated incumbent Senator Arlen Specter, 54% to 46%, but he lost the general election to Republican nominee Pat Toomey in a close race. Sestak sought a rematch with Toomey in the 2016 election, but lost the primary to Katie McGinty by just under ten points, in the closest and costliest Senate primary of the 2016 cycle, while facing opposition from prominent Democrats. Sestak then became president of FIRST Global, a nonprofit with the objective of promoting STEM education that brought high-school age teams from 157 countries to Washington, D.C., for the inaugural robotics Olympics. Early life, education and early career Sestak was born in Secane, Pennsylvania, the son of Kathleen L. (Schlichte) and Joseph Ambrose Sestak His grandfather Martin ≈†est√°k came to America from the Slovak village of Doln√© Lovƒçice in 1922, after World War I, while his father, Joseph Sr., was sent to join Martin in America in 1924.

Sestak's tough fight for Senate seat. The Philadelphia Inquirer. 11 April 2010. He continued his service after the war as an engineering officer at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Sestak attended Cardinal O'Hara High School in Springfield, Pennsylvania, where his mother worked as a math teacher. He was deeply inspired by his father and has recalled the time his father spent five hours fixing the family car in the freezing cold of a Philadelphia winter: > I remember going to the window and watching him. And the admiration that I > had‚Äîjust that strong determination of his. Never give in. Following in his father's footsteps, Sestak was accepted into the U.S. Naval Academy immediately after graduating from high school, during the Vietnam War. In 1974 Sestak graduated second in his class of over 900 midshipmen, with a Bachelor of Science degree in American political systems.VADM Joseph Sestak, USN Ret., Officer Bio File, United States Navy Operational Archives, U.S. Naval Historical Center, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.

Naval career Sestak commanded the to the title of best surface vessel in the Atlantic Fleet in the 1993 competition for the Battenberg Cup. As a surface warfare officer Sestak served division officer tours as damage control assistant, combat information center officer and weapons officer on the guided missile destroyer USS Richard E. Byrd, and later as weapons officer on the guided missile destroyer USS Hoel. He then served as aide and flag lieutenant to the admiral in charge of United States Navy surface forces in the Pacific. In January 1986 Sestak became executive officer of the guided missile frigate USS Underwood and was instrumental in the Underwood's winning the coveted battle E and the Battenberg Cup (awarded to the best ship in the Atlantic fleet). He then served in the Politico-Military Assessment Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On August 30, 1991, Sestak took command of the guided missile frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts, which was named the Atlantic Fleet's best surface combatant in the 1993 Battenberg Cup competition. In July 1993 Sestak became the head of the Strategy and Concepts Branch in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations. From November 1994 to March 1997 he was the Director for Defense Policy on the National Security Council staff at the White House, where he was responsible for the Clinton Administration's national security strategy, policies, programs, inter-agency and congressional coordination and regional political-military advice. In May 1997 he became the commander of Destroyer Squadron 14. Sestak then directed the CNO's Strategy and Policy Division (N51), and led the navy's efforts toward the 2000 Quadrennial Defense Review, for which he analyzed military strategic requirements and the economic value of U.S. defense spending. After the September 11 attacks he became the first director of the Navy Operations Group (Deep Blue), the navy's strategic anti-terrorism unit, which sought to redefine strategic, operational and budgetary policies in the Global War on Terrorism, reporting directly to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Vern Clark. In 2002 Sestak assumed command of the George Washington Aircraft Carrier Battle Group of 10 U.S. ships and 10,000 sailors, SEALs, marines, and 100 aircraft. He integrated it with a coalition of 20 allied ships and 5,000 sailors. It conducted combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sestak became the director of the CNO's Analysis Group, again reporting directly to CNO Clark as policy adviser and administrator, where he directed independent analysis on strategy, warfare requirements, and resources for the CNO outside of the normal bureaucratic process of the Navy staff. Under Clark, Sestak worked to rein in military spending by maximizing fleet efficiency. In 2004 he was appointed Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs (N6/N7), where he implemented his ideas and analyses in the Navy's $350 billion Five Year Defense Plan to transform the Navy from a less effective, expensive platform-centric force structure to a more effective capabilities-based force posture with cyber and sensors. It resulted in a shipbuilding plan that departed from the traditional goal for a 375-ship level to one as low as 260. In 2005 Sestak pushed for the addition of a second aircraft carrier in the Pacific to support allies, deter challenges from an emerging China, and be closer to potential hotspots such as the Koreas and the Taiwan Strait, saying, \\"if you don‚Äôt have the speed to get to the conflict when you really need to be there, you‚Äôre interesting, but irrelevant.‚Äù =Controversy over reassignment= Sestak as a vice admiral and serving as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs. In the summer of 2005, after CNO Clark retired, Sestak was administratively removed from his position as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs (N6/N7), a three-star position.Jacobson, Louis. Sestak: Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead. Real Clear Politics. 9 June 2009. His removal was one of the first changes made by Admiral Michael Mullen when he took over as the new Chief of Naval Operations in July 2005, according to Navy Times. Sestak was reassigned as a Special Assistant to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, and then opted to retire when his three-year-old daughter was diagnosed with malignant brain cancer. Controversy ensued over his departure: it was reported that he was pushed out because he \\"ruffled feathers\\" within the Bush Administration and came into conflict with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over Sestak's advocacy for spending cuts; Sestak's plan to change the Navy's force structure goals from 375 to as low as 260 by commanding the new emerging capability of cyberspace was controversial. 100 senior and junior officers as well as enlisted personnel who served with Sestak later signed a letter supporting him as ‚Äúa leader of the highest caliber, a man of tremendous character, and a military officer of uncommon compassion.‚Äù In an investigative report by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Chief of Naval Operations Vern Clark said of Sestak: > \\"He did what I asked him to do; I wanted straight talk, and this put him in > the cross-hairs. People are going to say what they want to say, but [Sestak] > challenged people who did not want to be challenged. The guy is courageous, > a patriot's patriot. Clark told that Associated Press that Sestak \\"was an incredible officer, the best I've ever seen. Incredible moral courage, the courage to take the independent stand. When everybody else was saying, 'This is what we ought to do,' he would stand up and say, 'I don't see it that way.'\\" Of Sestak's reassignment by Mullen, Clark told The New York Times, ‚ÄúI put him in that environment where he was in a position to create enemies,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI should have given him better top cover.‚Äù After Sestak retired from the United States Navy, his daughter made a full recovery from cancer. He retired as a two-star admiral, not having maintained the rank of three-star admiral long enough to retain it in retirement. =Military decorations= Sestak as a rear admiral. Sestak's decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, two Legion of Merit awards, two Meritorious Service Medals, Joint Service Commendation Medal, three Navy Commendation Medals and the Navy Achievement Medal. U.S. House of Representatives =2006 election= Sestak and Senator Chris Dodd at a children's issues talk in August 2006 Sestak was the second Democrat to win in Pennsylvania's traditionally Republican 7th congressional district since the Civil War. The race was in the national spotlight, as it was profiled in Time magazine as the harbinger of the national political climate of the 2006 elections and the most-watched swing district in the country. In 2006, with his daughter's recovery going smoothly, Sestak was motivated to run for Congress by the benefits he received under the United States Military's TRICARE health care program, which gave his daughter the care she needed to treat her brain tumor. Sestak stated that, during his travels to find the best treatment for his daughter, he saw children who did not have the same quality of care, or could not afford the necessary care. Sestak made health-care reform a pillar of his campaign in hopes of giving everyone the same care his family had. He called his congressional service a continuation of his military service, \\"paying back\\" the country that took care of his daughter. Sestak began laying the groundwork for a Congressional run in his home district in Pennsylvania as a Democrat. He was then told he had to first receive the endorsement of the \\"DCCC.\\" Sestak first thought this meant his hometown's Delaware County Community College, but he was eventually steered toward the correct DCCC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and informed its head, Rahm Emanuel, of his candidacy. Emanuel told Sestak he was not ready for the election. Pennsylvania's 7th district is heavily conservative, Republicans outnumbering Democrats 2:1. Sestak decided to run anyway and turned to his brother, Richard, and sisters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who served as his campaign manager, top fundraiser and treasurer, respectively. Sestak challenged ten-term Republican incumbent Curt Weldon in the race, and proved a capable fundraiser. In the second quarter of 2006, he raised $704,000 to Weldon's $692,000; in the third, $1.14 million to $912,000. As of September 30, 2006, Sestak had $1.53 million cash on hand, while Weldon had $1.12 million in the bank after making a $500,000 TV ad buy that had not started as of the close of the third quarter. Sestak received campaign donations from people around the world, including performer Jimmy Buffett, John Grisham, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and many Naval officers. A late September 2006 poll showed Sestak and Weldon locked in a statistical dead heat. Sestak led Weldon 44-43 among likely voters in a Franklin & Marshall College Keystone Poll released September 29. The poll also found that 49% of registered voters in the district felt it was time for change in the district and only 37% said Weldon deserved reelection.Bender, William. Sestak's coffers continue to grow. Delaware County Daily Times. 4 October 2006. The numbers suggested Sestak had seriously eroded Weldon's previous lead; an April 2006 poll conducted by the pro-Democratic Party organization Democracy Corps had Weldon leading 51% to 41%. On October 6 the nonpartisan Cook Political Report moved the race from \\"Lean Republican\\" to \\"Toss Up.\\" An October 8‚Äì10 survey by nonpartisan pollster Constituent Dynamics put Sestak ahead 51‚Äì44.

Most significantly, Sestak created the House Pediatric Cancer Caucus, which he co-chaired; extended benefits for those seeking work (COBRA) as a part of the JOBS bill; co-wrote the amendment to give small businesses tax credits, as a part of health care reform; and moved the first significant federal funds into autism care and research, nicknamed the \\"Sestak Amendment.\\" As Congress's senior veteran, Sestak was an original cosponsor of the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell as well as the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. He also strongly advocated ending bailouts to banks in the Wall Street Reform Bill. Sestak voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 but lamented that it did not provide enough accountability measures.Final Vote Results for Roll Call 46.

The Pennsylvania Progressive =Social media= In 2007 Sestak's campaign was the first federal campaign to create a Facebook Fan Page. Sestak joined Twitter shortly before he was sworn in for his second term. His congressional account made him the first congressperson on Twitter to use it on an official basis. After he left office his social networks were merged with his personal accounts, which have been verified. Sestak is said to have been a prime example of the Colbert Bump. After appearing on \\"The Colbert Report\\" in 2008, Sestak spoke of the positive impact of social media and viral video clips of the appearance. He appeared on the show even after Democratic leaders Rahm Emanuel and Nancy Pelosi instructed Democrats not to. After his first appearance, Sestak won his election in a landslide in a Republican majority district, and after appearing again in 2009 as a part of his announcement of his candidacy against incumbent Senator Arlen Specter in the 2010 Democratic primary, Sestak won by a surprising eight points. He did not appear on the show during the 2010 general election, which he narrowly lost. The day after the loss, host Stephen Colbert lamented the loss on air, calling Sestak a \\"friend\\". =Congressional staff= Sestak and his staff were recognized for their successful tenure and he was voted \\"The Most Productive Member of Congress.\\" Sestak focused heavily on the constituent services his office provided the people of his district as he entered Congress just as the Great Recession began, homes were being foreclosed, and health care and other services were being denied as people lost their jobs and missed payments. During his four years in Congress from 2007 to 2011, Sestak's office handled 18,000 cases, between three to four times the number of the average congressional office. \\"Every person who has worked for me has been tremendous,\\" he said. Sestak hosted an average of 15 large summit gatherings in his district each year on key issues. Some critics were quick to cite Sestak's handling of his Congressional staff as supporting \\"the perception that he is a taskmaster with a prickly streak.\\" During his first term in office, Sestak employed 61 people as staff in his official congressional office, while comparable representatives employed a total of 28, 26, and 25 staff members, indicating that Sestak had a high turnover rate, although a number of them were interns or had been hired as temporary staff members. The Hill reported that several former staffers said that \\"aides are expected to work seven days a week, including holidays, often 14 hours each day, going for months without a day off. These are very long hours even by Capitol Hill standards\\". A former aide added that Sestak's staff turnover was not as much of a drawback as one might expect. \\"Other Members rely on their staff to keep themselves informed, but with him, it's top-down,\\" the former aide said. \\"He knows what he wants to accomplish, so in a sense, he just needs people to dictate to.\\" Sestak acknowledged that his aides spend long hours on duty and that the work is \\"pretty demanding.\\" He added that the staff was becoming stabler over time, with the turnover rate normalizing by the end of his second term. Contemporaneous staff accounts were published in the Delaware County Times, including Clarence Tong, a spokesman who had been with Sestak since the campaign, who said \\"They're getting off. The only person who does work Sunday is someone who travels with the congressman when he goes to different constituent meetings... I think the reality is, my boss doesn't deny he asks a lot of people who work for him ... I think he's someone who's very fair to work for\\"; Ashley Miller, a former aide, who said, \\"We were working long hours, there's no doubt about that, but it was absolutely what was needed to do it. None of us were happy leaving things half done at the end of the day\\"; Bryan Branton, Sestak's former chief of staff, who said, \\"Every freshman office has to work that much harder because you're starting an office from scratch. The people who have since left the campaign have done so because they had other things they were planning on doing\\"; and Ryan Rudominer, Sestak's communications director during the campaign, who said, \\"Just like it took hard work to defeat a 20-year incumbent ... it takes hard work to pass as much legislation as Joe has passed as a first-term congressman, to hold as many summits and town halls as Joe has held and to be as responsive to constituents as Joe is.\\" =2008 presidential election= Sestak endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the 2008 Democratic primaries and served as her campaign national security adviser, specializing in veterans. He told Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report that he trusted her leadership after serving with her in the White House. In addition to being Clinton's foreign policy adviser, Sestak served as her superdelegate and was a surrogate throughout the primary, making appearances at several rallies and on television, including in an ad emphasizing Clinton's foreign policy strengths. Sestak endorsed Barack Obama in the general election after Obama received the Democratic nomination. =Committee assignments= * Committee on Armed Services ** Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces ** Subcommittee on Air and Land Forces ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * Committee on Education and Labor ** Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education ** Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions * Committee on Small Business (Vice Chairman) ** Subcommittee on Finance and Tax ** Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology ** Subcommittee on Regulations, Healthcare and Trade 2010 U.S. Senate election =Primary election= Sestak speaking at an \\"Employee Free Choice Act Rally\\" at the Pennsylvania State Democratic Convention in Pittsburgh in June 2009. Sestak ran against Arlen Specter (right) Whispers of a possible U.S. Senate campaign appeared in 2008 after Sestak's landslide victory and $3 million campaign surplus after his reelection. Even before Arlen Specter's announcement to switch parties, draft efforts were organized. But after Specter switched from a Republican to a Democrat to ensure that (once Al Franken was seated) Democrats had a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority, Democrats, including President Obama and Governor Rendell, promised to support Specter in both the primary and the general election. Nationwide support mounted for Sestak's possible senatorial campaign, a primary challenge to Specter. Most prominent was a straw poll conducted by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee titled \\"Should a Draft Sestak movement be created to take on Sen. Arlen Specter in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary?\\" Almost 8,000 votes were cast nationwide, with 86% responding yes, including 85% of Pennsylvanians. Sestak faced significant opposition to his candidacy from President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, the national Democratic Party and the state party, even though Sestak pointed out Specter's humiliation of Anita Hill during her testimony about her harassment by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and other votes of Specter's. Then-Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell said on national television, \\"Joe Sestak should not run for the Senate in the Democratic primary.\\"'The Ed Show' for Friday, May 29. NBC News. Sestak responded, \\"there's no more kings, there's no more kingmakers in America,\\" and proceeded to visit all 67 counties of Pennsylvania. On May 27, 2009, Sestak indicated that he intended to challenge Specter in the 2010 Democratic primary (pending a final family decision because he had not \\"had the time to sit down with my eight-year-old daughter or my wife to make sure that we are all ready to get in\\"). In June he was overheard saying \\"[i]t would take an act of God for me to not get in now\\". In a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted May 20‚Äì26, Specter led the Democratic primary with 50 percent, with Sestak at 21 percent and 27 percent undecided. Despite the gap, it was noted that Sestak did not have much statewide recognition at the time, as he represented only one of Pennsylvania's 19 congressional districts. On August 4 Sestak officially announced his candidacy. His brother, Richard, was his campaign manager. In discussing Specter's switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party, Sestak has said that the switch was \\"100 percent\\" motivated by politics.March 17, 2010. Midweek Politics with David Pakman. Democratic opposition Throughout the primary election the Obama administration and the Democratic Party campaigned heavily against Sestak, as the President, Vice President, and numerous cabinet members and Senators hosted many fundraisers and events for Specter. On September 19, 2009, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid even shut down the entire United States Senate, as he, the President, and many Senators instead flew to Philadelphia to host a prominent fundraiser for Specter. The event drew controversy for closing federal business and because the money raised during the event would be given to Republicans and conservative PACs that asked for refunds of contributions given before Specter's party switch. Obama's presidential campaign, called \\"Organizing for America\\" during the off years, also led efforts against Sestak. Even the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) decided to spend the maximum \\"coordinated funds\\" for Specter, which differ from most party spending in that the committee can use the money to work with the candidate and supplement his or her ad buys. Job offer to Sestak In a February 2010 interview Sestak responded affirmatively when asked if the Obama administration had offered him a \\"federal job\\" if he would end his candidacy for the Senate. Sestak stated that he had quickly refused the offer.Fitzgerald, Thomas. Sestak holds to story of job offer. The Philadelphia Inquirer. 20 February 2010. When asked to give the specifics of the offer on Midweek Politics with David Pakman, he refused. The White House initially \\"vociferously\\" denied that an offer had been made, and Sestak continued to offer no further details until the Obama administration released White House Counsel Robert F. Bauer's official report on the incident on May 28, clarifying that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to approach Sestak about potential, uncompensated executive branch positions on senior advisory boards and stating Bauer's official opinion that nothing inappropriate, illegal or unethical had taken place. The official report also stated that Clinton had made the offer on behalf of the Obama administration. After the report's release, Sestak issued a statement essentially confirming it. Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, the minority leader on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, initially alleged that such an offer and Sestak's failure to report it could be felonies. Legal analysts disagreed, and Issa subsequently backtracked and dismissed the issue; his spokesperson said, ‚Äúit was a mistake‚Äù, and Issa said, \\"as we discovered, that it turns out that Republicans and previous administrations thought it was OK.\\" Primary result Specter held a 20-point lead in polls as late as April 2010, and enjoyed support from the Democratic establishment, including Rendell and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, with the latter trying to mobilize voters in that city for Specter. A moderate Republican, Specter had switched parties after polls showed him likely being defeated by the more conservative Pat Toomey in the Republican primary, a rematch of the 2004 nomination contest where Specter narrowly defeated Toomey. Sestak attacked Specter's switch as \\"self-interested\\", and the move was disapproved of by a majority of registered Democrats in Pennsylvania, while a \\"fervent anti-incumbent mood\\" prevailed nationwide in the 2010 midterm elections. The Sestak campaign also ran an ad showing Specter with President George W. Bush, which seriously damaged Specter's standing. Sestak gained momentum in the last days of the primary contest as the turnout in Philadelphia for Specter failed to meet expectations. At a little after 10 p.m. on May 18 the Associated Press called the primary for Sestak, 53% to 47%.Toeplitz, Shira. The admiral sinks Arlen Specter. Politico. 18 May 2010. =General election= Many cited the Pennsylvania Senate general election as the \\"marquee race of 2010\\", a bellwether of the national stage. After securing the Democratic Party's nomination, calling it \\"a win for the people, over the establishment, over the status quo, even over Washington, DC,\\" Sestak enjoyed a slight lead in the polls against the Republican nominee, former Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey. But while Sestak tried to recoup his financial losses after a long primary, Toomey had not faced a competitive primary and aired TV ads much earlier than Sestak. Toomey's effective fundraising and advertising allowed him to rise in the polls, at one point gaining a double-digit lead, causing political pundits to move the race from \\"Toss Up\\" to \\"Lean Republican.\\" Many stopped short of calling the race \\"Solid Republican\\" as Sestak had a reputation for campaigning until he \\"sees the whites of their eyes\\" and 11th-hour comebacks. Sestak began airing ads in mid- fall and overcame his deficit in opinion polls, closing to within the margin of error. Toomey had been running unanswered ads depicting Sestak as a liberal for several months before the DSCC purchased airtime toward the end of the campaign. At the beginning of election night Sestak led in the exit polls by a wide margin, but as more votes were counted and central Pennsylvania's \\"red T\\" area began reporting, Toomey caught up. Counting continued until early morning, as the numbers were too close for a winner to be declared. As the percentages stabilized, it became clear Toomey was the winner. Sestak conceded the race to a ballroom full of his supporters at the Radnor Hotel. Toomey defeated Sestak, 51% to 49%, a margin of 80,229 votes out of almost four million cast, a margin large enough to avoid a recount. Percentage-wise, it was the smallest losing margin of any Pennsylvania Democratic candidate in 2010.Picture of Joe Sestak and family at Radnor Hotel, 11/3/2010. http://twitpic.com/33ghxo The total spent on the race was $20 million, the most of any federal election in 2010. After Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was decided, conservative Political Action Committees and corporations broke the record for outside spending, airing ads on Toomey's behalf and causing Sestak to be outspent 3 to 1. Sestak received little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), which had spent significantly to assist Specter in the primary. The gap between pro-Toomey and pro-Sestak ads was the largest of any Senate race in the nation. Sestak responded to this outside spending at Philadelphia Constitution Hall, arguing, \\"It is we, the people. Not we, the corporations, nor we, Wall Street.\\" Despite the funding gap, Sestak outperformed Pennsylvania's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, who lost by 9%, as well as the four Democratic Representatives who lost reelection by broad margins (Patrick Murphy by 7%, Paul Kanjorski by 9%, Kathy Dahlkemper by 11%, and Chris Carney by 10%). Sestak returned to each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties to thank his supporters, including numerous African American churches, synagogues, and mosques that had welcomed him. 2016 U.S. Senate election After his defeat, Sestak served as a professor at Cheyney University, the oldest historically black university in America, and as a Distinguished Practice Professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. In May 2013 he was named the 2013‚Äì14 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership, a joint initiative among the United States Army War College, Dickinson College and the Pennsylvania State University ‚Äì Dickinson School of Law. Previous recipients of the Bradley Chair include former Assistant Secretary of State Philip J. Crowley and retired Major General John D. Altenburg. Sestak taught courses on \\"Ethical Leadership\\" and \\"Restoring the American Dream.\\" Sestak remained active in public service through the Center for Refugee and Disaster Response at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; the Ploughshares Fund working on nuclear disarmament; the Lenfest Foundation focused on education in Philadelphia, pre-K through early childhood, and those in danger of leaving or having left high school; co-chair with former Republican governor Mark Schweiker of the Pennsylvania State Advisory Committee of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, focused on U.S. diplomacy and development; and then-Secretary of State Clinton's Advisory Committee on U.S. educational programs. =Primary election= In 2013 Sestak announced he was considering a rematch with Toomey. In September 2014, as he campaigned with 2014 gubernatorial nominee Tom Wolf, he said he would make an official announcement soon. In November 2014 he sent out an email confirming that he would run, and in March 2015 he officially launched his campaign by walking 422 miles across Pennsylvania from the New Jersey to the Ohio borders, holding town hall meetings each day, saying throughout his campaign kickoff and the remainder of the election that \\"we are in a fight for the soul of America.\\" Sestak simultaneously published his vision in a policy-based book, \\"Walking in Your Shoes to Restore the American Dream,\\" co-authored with Jake Sternberger. If Sestak had been nominated to run against Toomey in 2016 it would have been the first rematch for a United States Senate seat in Pennsylvania history. But starting in early 2015 after he refused to hire a party-approved campaign manager and other designated staffers as well as Washington, D.C.-based political consultants and firms, Sestak faced considerable opposition from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and EMILY's List. Many establishment Democrats also resented Sestak for defeating Arlen Specter in the 2010 primary. Sestak had led consistently in the polls, sometimes by as much as 17 points, though national Democrats including Obama encouraged six candidates to challenge Sestak in the primary, with Katie McGinty emerging as the establishment's preferred nominee. The DSCC provided over $1.5 million to McGinty's campaign, when no other non- incumbent Democrat in the nation received more than $14,000, with over $6 million being spent by pro-McGinty Super PACs on mailings, digital ads, and TV commercials. One of the commercials was an attack ad that the Washington Post assigned its highest rating of falsity and called \\"a sleazy way to win a campaign.\\" Sestak's initial lead in polls dwindled and McGinty won the April 26 Democratic primary. The national Democrats' meddling in the primary was largely unpopular with their liberal base, as Sestak consistently polled higher than McGinty in a hypothetical matchup against Toomey. The Toomey campaign had also regarded Sestak as a stronger challenger since he was \\"a political outsider, well-attuned to the public's anti-establishment mood.\\" In the most expensive election for a U.S. Senate seat ever, Toomey narrowly defeated McGinty to win reelection.  2020 presidential campaign  Sestak campaigning in Clear Lake, Iowa in August 2019 On June 23, 2019, Sestak announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election in a video posted on his website. Sestak entered the race days before the first Democratic presidential debate was held, and did not participate in any debates held in subsequent months, failing to meet the minimum requirements for eligibility. He attracted very little media attention and never polled above 1%. On December 1, 2019, he ended his bid for the Democratic nomination. He endorsed Amy Klobuchar on February 7, 2020.

Once in office, in 2007, he supported Congressional efforts to redeploy forces and submitted legislation for commencing the redeployment, allowing one year to safely withdraw the troops. He also voted for the war supplemental the House constructed after President Bush's veto, a bill many critics of the Bush administration called a \\"blank check\\" for the four month continuation of administration policies in the Middle East.Joe Sestak and Allyson Schwartz Vote to Continue the War Unabated. Young Philly Politics. 22 June 2008. In response, Sestak and other veterans argued that they should not punish soldiers for the President's actions, and supported the bill in order to give the armed forces adequate protection and equipment until withdrawn for the one year it would take to do it safely. Sestak supported the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which critics contended continued the Bush administration's policy of warrantless wiretapping and provided retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies who participated in the National Security Agency's \\"terrorist surveillance program.\\"Roll Call Vote for HR 6304, FISA Amendments Act.

Sestak was an opponent of the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy that excluded LGBT people from serving openly in the United States military, stating that the policy means \\"[w]e're absolutely not adhering to the ideals of our nation\\". He was instrumental in bringing to light a two-year pattern of abuse, including anti-gay hazing, that took place in a Military Working Dog unit stationed in Bahrain, sparking an investigation that turned up nearly 100 instances of abuse. Electoral history Nonprofit work In 2017, Sestak became the first president of FIRST Global, a nonprofit founded by Dean Kamen with the objective of promoting STEM education and careers in the developing world through Olympics-style robotics competitions. In July 2017, the inaugural FIRST Global Challenge brought together high school student teams from 157 countries. Afghanistan's team made headlines when its visa requests were denied twice and it almost missed the competition, until President Donald Trump intervened to urge the State Department authorities to reconsider. The five girls were granted entry to the U.S. less than a week before the competition. Each country that applied to be in the competition, including those on the Trump Administration's travel ban list‚Äîfrom Iran to a Syrian Refugee team‚Äîobtained U.S. visas to attend the competition. Women were responsible for leading, organizing, or funding 60% of all nations' teams. 84 of the teams had not had either STEM education or robotics. Sestak established \\"The Global STEM Corps\\" of approximately 800 U.S. and international college, high school, and other STEM volunteers to \\"adopt\\" a team for online assistance in the engineering and electronics \\"best assemblage\\" of their robot for the game competition. Personal life Sestak is married to the former Susan L. Clark, who works in international environmental issues from Kazakhstan to Mozambique; Russian relations, including the U.S. team searching for clues for Prisoners of War/Missing in Action within Soviet Union archives; and on suicide prevention for the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense.

Functions * Coordinates the activities of more than 70 polypeptides required for initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II * Binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly * Serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex * Acts as a channel for regulatory signals Structure TFIID is itself composed of TBP and several subunits called TATA-binding protein Associated Factors (TBP-associated factors, or TAFs). In a test tube, only TBP is necessary for transcription at promoters that contain a TATA box. TAFs, however, add promoter selectivity, especially if there is no TATA box sequence for TBP to bind to. TAFs are included in two distinct complexes, TFIID and B-TFIID. The TFIID complex is composed of TBP and more than eight TAFs. But, the majority of TBP is present in the B-TFIID complex, which is composed of TBP and TAFII170 (BTAF1) in a 1:1 ratio. TFIID and B-TFIID are not equivalent, since transcription reactions utilizing TFIID are responsive to gene specific transcription factors such as SP1, while reactions reconstituted with B-TFIID are not. Subunits in the TFIID complex include: * TBP (TATA binding protein), or: ** TBP-related factors in animals (TBPL1; TBPL2) * TAF1 (TAFII250) * TAF2 (CIF150) * TAF3 (TAFII140) * TAF4 (TAFII130/135) * TAF4B (TAFII105) * TAF5 (TAFII100) * TAF6 (TAFII70/80) * TAF7 (TAFII55) * TAF8 (TAFII43) * TAF9 (TAFII31/32) * TAF9B (TAFII31L) * TAF10 (TAFII30) * TAF11 (TAFII28) * TAF12 (TAFII20/15) * TAF13 (TAFII18) * TAF15 (TAFII68)  See also  * Eukaryotic transcription * General transcription factor * Preinitiation complex * Regulation of gene expression * RNA polymerase II holoenzyme * TATA binding protein * Transcription (genetics)  References  External links  3D electron microscopy structures of TFIID from the EM Data Bank(EMDB) Gene expression Molecular genetics Proteins Transcription factors ","title":"Transcription factor II D"},{"id":"4021273","text":"Nabataean trade routes in Pre-Islamic Arabia Gravestone of a young woman named Aban, portrayed frontally with a raised right hand and a sheaf of a wheat in her left hand, symbolizing fertility. British Museum, London Pre-Islamic Arabia (Arabic: ÿ¥ÿ®Ÿá ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ŸÇÿ®ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ) is the Arabian Peninsula prior to the emergence of Islam in 610 CE. Some of the settled communities developed into distinctive civilizations. Information about these communities is limited and has been pieced together from archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions which were later recorded by Islamic historians. Among the most prominent civilizations were the Thamud civilization, which arose around 3000 BCE and lasted to around 300 CE, and the Dilmun civilization, which arose around the end of the fourth millennium and lasted to around 600 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BCE, Southern Arabia was the home to a number of kingdoms such as the Sabaeans, and Eastern Arabia was inhabited by Semitic speakers who presumably migrated from the southwest, such as the so-called Samad population. A few nodal points were controlled by Iranian Parthian and Sassanian colonists. Pre-Islamic religion in Arabia included indigenous polytheistic beliefs, various forms of Christianity, Judaism, Manichaeism, and Zoroastrianism. Studies Scientific studies of Pre-Islamic Arabs starts with the Arabists of the early 19th century when they managed to decipher epigraphic Old South Arabian (10th century BCE), Ancient North Arabian (6th century BCE) and other writings of pre-Islamic Arabia. Thus, studies are no longer limited to the written traditions, which are not local due to the lack of surviving Arab historians' accounts of that era; the paucity of material is compensated for by written sources from other cultures (such as Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, etc.), so it was not known in great detail. From the 3rd century CE, Arabian history becomes more tangible with the rise of the ·∏§imyarite, and with the appearance of the Qa·∏•·π≠ƒÅnites in the Levant and the gradual assimilation of the Nabataeans by the Qa·∏•·π≠ƒÅnites in the early centuries CE, a pattern of expansion exceeded in the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. Sources of history include archaeological evidence, foreign accounts and oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars‚Äîespecially in the pre-Islamic poems‚Äîand the ·∏§adƒ´th, plus a number of ancient Arab documents that survived into medieval times when portions of them were cited or recorded. Archaeological exploration in the Arabian Peninsula has been sparse but fruitful; and many ancient sites have been identified by modern excavations. The most recent detailed study of pre-Islamic Arabia is Arabs and Empires Before Islam, published by Oxford University Press in 2015. This book collects a diverse range of ancient texts and inscriptions for the history especially of the northern region during this time period.

Claudius Ptolemy's Geographos (2nd century CE) refers to the area as the \\"land of the Iobaritae\\" a region which legend later referred to as Ubar. The origin of the Midianites has not been established. Because of the Mycenaean motifs on what is referred to as Midianite pottery, some scholars including George Mendenhall,George Mendenhall, \\"Qurayya and the Midianites,\\" in Studies in the History of Arabia, Vol. 3, ed. A. R. Al-Ansary (Riyadh: King Saud University), pp. 137‚Äì45 Peter Parr,Peter J.

The question of the origin of the Midianites still remains open.  Overview of major kingdoms  The history of Pre-Islamic Arabia before the rise of Islam in the 610s is not known in great detail. Archaeological exploration in the Arabian peninsula has been sparse; indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern Arabia. Existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, Romans, etc.) and oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Many small kingdoms prospered from Red sea and Indian Ocean trade. Major kingdoms included the Sabaeans, Awsan, Himyar and the Nabateans The first known inscriptions of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut are known from the 8th century BC. It was first referenced by an outside civilization in an Old Sabaic inscription of Karab'il Watar from the early 7th century BC, in which the King of Hadramaut, Yada\`'il, is mentioned as being one of his allies. Dilmun appears first in Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets dated to the end of 4th millennium BC, found in the temple of goddess Inanna, in the city of Uruk. The adjective Dilmun refers to a type of axe and one specific official; in addition, there are lists of rations of wool issued to people connected with Dilmun.Crawford, Harriet E. W. (1998). Dilmun and its Gulf neighbours. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 5. The Sabaeans were an ancient people speaking an Old South Arabian language who lived in what is today Yemen, in south west Arabian Peninsula; from 2000 BC to the 8th century BC. Some Sabaeans also lived in D'mt, located in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, due to their hegemony over the Red Sea.Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity, 1991. They lasted from the early 2nd millennium to the 1st century BC. In the 1st century BC it was conquered by the Himyarites, but after the disintegration of the first Himyarite empire of the Kings of Saba' and dhu-Raydan the Middle Sabaean Kingdom reappeared in the early 2nd century. It was finally conquered by the Himyarites in the late 3rd century. The ancient Kingdom of Awsan with a capital at Hagar Yahirr in the wadi Markha, to the south of the wadi Bayhan, is now marked by a tell or artificial mound, which is locally named Hagar Asfal. Once it was one of the most important small kingdoms of South Arabia. The city seems to have been destroyed in the 7th century BC by the king and mukarrib of Saba Karib'il Watar, according to a Sabaean text that reports the victory in terms that attest to its significance for the Sabaeans. The Himyar was a state in ancient South Arabia dating from 110 BC. It conquered neighbouring Saba (Sheba) in c. 25 BC, Qataban in c. 200 AD and Hadramaut c. 300 AD. Its political fortunes relative to Saba changed frequently until it finally conquered the Sabaean Kingdom around 280 AD.See, e.g., Bafaqih 1990. It was the dominant state in Arabia until 525 AD. The economy was based on agriculture. Foreign trade was based on the export of frankincense and myrrh. For many years it was also the major intermediary linking East Africa and the Mediterranean world. This trade largely consisted of exporting ivory from Africa to be sold in the Roman Empire. Ships from Himyar regularly traveled the East African coast, and the state also exerted a considerable amount of political control of the trading cities of East Africa. The Nabataean origins remain obscure. On the similarity of sounds, Jerome suggested a connection with the tribe Nebaioth mentioned in Genesis, but modern historians are cautious about an early Nabatean history. The Babylonian captivity that began in 586 BC opened a power vacuum in Judah, and as Edomites moved into Judaean grazing lands, Nabataean inscriptions began to be left in Edomite territory (earlier than 312 BC, when they were attacked at Petra without success by Antigonus I). The first definite appearance was in 312 BC, when Hieronymus of Cardia, a Seleucid officer, mentioned the Nabateans in a battle report. In 50 BC, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus cited Hieronymus in his report, and added the following: \\"Just as the Seleucids had tried to subdue them, so the Romans made several attempts to get their hands on that lucrative trade.\\" Petra or Sela was the ancient capital of Edom; the Nabataeans must have occupied the old Edomite country, and succeeded to its commerce, after the Edomites took advantage of the Babylonian captivity to press forward into southern Judaea. This migration, the date of which cannot be determined, also made them masters of the shores of the Gulf of Aqaba and the important harbor of Elath. Here, according to Agatharchides, they were for a time very troublesome, as wreckers and pirates, to the reopened commerce between Egypt and the East, until they were chastised by the Ptolemaic rulers of Alexandria. The Lakhmid Kingdom was founded by the Lakhum tribe that immigrated out of Yemen in the 2nd century and ruled by the Banu Lakhm, hence the name given it. It was formed of a group of Arab Christians who lived in Southern Iraq, and made al-Hirah their capital in (266). The founder of the dynasty was 'Amr and the son Imru' al-Qais converted to Christianity. Gradually the whole city converted to that faith. Imru' al-Qais dreamt of a unified and independent Arab kingdom and, following that dream, he seized many cities in Arabia. The Ghassanids were a group of South Arabian Christian tribes that emigrated in the early 3rd century from Yemen to the Hauran in southern Syria, Jordan and the Holy Land where they intermarried with Hellenized Roman settlers and Greek-speaking Early Christian communities. The Ghassanid emigration has been passed down in the rich oral tradition of southern Syria. It is said that the Ghassanids came from the city of Ma'rib in Yemen. There was a dam in this city, however one year there was so much rain that the dam was carried away by the ensuing flood. Thus the people there had to leave. The inhabitants emigrated seeking to live in less arid lands and became scattered far and wide. The proverb \\"They were scattered like the people of Saba\\" refers to that exodus in history. The emigrants were from the southern Arab tribe of Azd of the Kahlan branch of Qahtani tribes. Eastern Arabia The sedentary people of pre-Islamic Eastern Arabia were mainly Aramaic speakers and to some degree Persian speakers while Syriac functioned as a liturgical language. In pre-Islamic times, the population of Eastern Arabia consisted of Christianized Arabs (including Abd al-Qays), Aramean Christians, Persian-speaking Zoroastrians and Jewish agriculturalists. According to Robert Bertram Serjeant, the Baharna may be the Arabized \\"descendants of converts from the original population of Christians (Aramaeans), Jews and ancient Persians (Majus) inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal provinces of Eastern Arabia at the time of the Arab conquest\\". Other archaeological assemblages cannot be brought clearly into larger context, such as the Samad Late Iron Age.Paul A. Yule, Cross-roads ‚Äì Early and Late Iron Age South-eastern Arabia, Abhandlungen Deutsche Orient- Gesellschaft, vol. 30, Wiesbaden 2014, Zoroastrianism was also present in Eastern Arabia. The Zoroastrians of Eastern Arabia were known as \\"Majoos\\" in pre-Islamic times. The sedentary dialects of Eastern Arabia, including Bahrani Arabic, were influenced by Akkadian, Aramaic and Syriac languages. =Dilmun= Dilmun and its neighbors in the 10th century BCE. The Dilmun civilization was an important trading centre which at the height of its power controlled the Persian Gulf trading routes. The Sumerians regarded Dilmun as holy land. Dilmun is regarded as one of the oldest ancient civilizations in the Middle East. The Sumerians described Dilmun as a paradise garden in the Epic of Gilgamesh. The Sumerian tale of the garden paradise of Dilmun may have been an inspiration for the Garden of Eden story. Dilmun appears first in Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets dated to the end of fourth millennium BCE, found in the temple of goddess Inanna, in the city of Uruk. The adjective \\"Dilmun\\" is used to describe a type of axe and one specific official; in addition there are lists of rations of wool issued to people connected with Dilmun.Dilmun and Its Gulf Neighbours by Harriet E. W. Crawford, page 5 Dilmun was an important trading center from the late fourth millennium to 1800 BCE. Dilmun was very prosperous during the first 300 years of the second millennium. Dilmun's commercial power began to decline between 2000 BCE and 1800 BCE because piracy flourished in the Persian Gulf. In 600 BCE, the Babylonians and later the Persians added Dilmun to their empires. The Dilmun civilization was the centre of commercial activities linking traditional agriculture of the land with maritime trade between diverse regions as the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia in the early period and China and the Mediterranean in the later period (from the 3rd to the 16th century CE). Dilmun was mentioned in two letters dated to the reign of Burna-Buriash II (c. 1370 BCE) recovered from Nippur, during the Kassite dynasty of Babylon. These letters were from a provincial official, Ilƒ´-ippa≈°ra, in Dilmun to his friend Enlil-kidinni in Mesopotamia. The names referred to are Akkadian. These letters and other documents, hint at an administrative relationship between Dilmun and Babylon at that time. Following the collapse of the Kassite dynasty, Mesopotamian documents make no mention of Dilmun with the exception of Assyrian inscriptions dated to 1250 BCE which proclaimed the Assyrian king to be king of Dilmun and Meluhha. Assyrian inscriptions recorded tribute from Dilmun. There are other Assyrian inscriptions during the first millennium BCE indicating Assyrian sovereignty over Dilmun. Dilmun was also later on controlled by the Kassite dynasty in Mesopotamia. Dilmun, sometimes described as \\"the place where the sun rises\\" and \\"the Land of the Living\\", is the scene of some versions of the Sumerian creation myth, and the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, Utnapishtim (Ziusudra), was taken by the gods to live forever. Thorkild Jacobsen's translation of the Eridu Genesis calls it \\"Mount Dilmun\\" which he locates as a \\"faraway, half-mythical place\\". Dilmun is also described in the epic story of Enki and Ninhursag as the site at which the Creation occurred. The promise of Enki to Ninhursag, the Earth Mother: > For Dilmun, the land of my lady's heart, I will create long waterways, > rivers and canals, whereby water will flow to quench the thirst of all > beings and bring abundance to all that lives. Ninlil, the Sumerian goddess of air and south wind had her home in Dilmun. It is also featured in the Epic of Gilgamesh. However, in the early epic \\"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\\", the main events, which center on Enmerkar's construction of the ziggurats in Uruk and Eridu, are described as taking place in a world \\"before Dilmun had yet been settled\\". =Gerrha= Gerrha and its neighbors in 1 CE. Gerrha (), was an ancient city of Eastern Arabia, on the west side of the Persian Gulf. More accurately, the ancient city of Gerrha has been determined to have existed near or under the present fort of Uqair. This fort is 50 miles northeast of al-Hasa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. This site was first proposed by R. E. Cheesman in 1924. Gerrha and Uqair are archaeological sites on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula.Potts (1990), p. 56.Bibby, pp. 317-318. Prior to Gerrha, the area belonged to the Dilmun civilization, which was conquered by the Assyrian Empire in 709 BCE. Gerrha was the center of an Arab kingdom from approximately 650 BCE to circa 300 CE. The kingdom was attacked by Antiochus III the Great in 205-204 BCE, though it seems to have survived. It is currently unknown exactly when Gerrha fell, but the area was under Sassanid Persian control after 300 CE. Gerrha was described by StraboStrabon, Geography, i6. 4. 19-20 as inhabited by Chaldean exiles from Babylon, who built their houses of salt and repaired them by the application of salt water. Pliny the Elder (lust. Nat. vi. 32) says it was 5 miles in circumference with towers built of square blocks of salt. Gerrha was destroyed by the Qarmatians in the end of the 9th century where all inhabitants were massacred (300,000). It was 2 miles from the Persian Gulf near current day Hofuf. The researcher Abdulkhaliq Al Janbi argued in his bookGerrha, The Ancient City Of International Trade ÿ¨ÿ±Ÿá ŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ¨ÿßÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÇÿØŸäŸÖÿ© that Gerrha was most likely the ancient city of Hajar, located in modern-day Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Al Janbi's theory is the most widely accepted one by modern scholars, although there are some difficulties with this argument given that Al Ahsa is 60 km inland and thus less likely to be the starting point for a trader's route, making the location within the archipelago of islands comprising the modern Kingdom of Bahrain, particularly the main island of Bahrain itself, another possibility.Larsen, Curtis (1983). Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient Society. University of Chicago Press. . Various other identifications of the site have been attempted, Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville choosing Qatif, Carsten Niebuhr preferring Kuwait and C Forster suggesting the ruins at the head of the bay behind the islands of Bahrain. =Tylos= Asia in 600 CE, showing the Sassanid Empire before the Arab conquest. Bahrain was referred to by the Greeks as Tylos, the centre of pearl trading, when Nearchus came to discover it serving under Alexander the Great.Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient Society By Curtis E. Larsen p. 13 From the 6th to 3rd century BCE Bahrain was included in Persian Empire by Achaemenians, an Iranian dynasty.Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography By Pirouz Mojtahed-Zadeh, page 119 The Greek admiral Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit this islands, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: \\"That in the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton tree, from which are manufactured clothes called sindones, a very different degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia.\\"Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, Historical Researches Into the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Principal Nations of Antiquity, Henry Bohn, 1854 p38 The Greek historian, Theophrastus, states that much of the islands were covered in these cotton trees and that Tylos was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.Arnold Heeren, ibid, p441 Ares was also worshipped by the ancient Baharna and the Greek colonists.See Ares, Ares in the Arabian Peninsula section It is not known whether Bahrain was part of the Seleucid Empire, although the archaeological site at Qalat Al Bahrain has been proposed as a Seleucid base in the Persian Gulf.Classical Greece: Ancient histories and modern archaeologies, Ian Morris, Routledge, p184 Alexander had planned to settle the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf with Greek colonists, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Tylos was very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.Phillip Ward, Bahrain: A Travel Guide, Oleander Press p68 Tylos even became the site of Greek athletic contests.W. B. Fisher et al. The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge University Press 1968 p40 The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic, Tilmun (from Dilmun).Jean Francois Salles in Traces of Paradise: The Archaeology of Bahrain, 2500BC-300AD in Michael Rice, Harriet Crawford Ed, IB Tauris, 2002 p132 The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until Ptolemy's Geographia when the inhabitants are referred to as 'Thilouanoi'.Jean Francois Salles p132 Some place names in Bahrain go back to the Tylos era, for instance, the residential suburb of Arad in Muharraq, is believed to originate from \\"Arados\\", the ancient Greek name for Muharraq island.Curtis E. Larsen. Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society University Of Chicago Press, 1984 p13 Assyrian king Sennacherib, during his war against the Chaldeans in the Persian Gulf, c. 700 BCE Herodotus's account (written c. 440 BCE) refers to the Io and Europa myths. (History, I:1). The Greek historian Strabo believed the Phoenicians originated from Eastern Arabia. Herodotus also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was Eastern Arabia. This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: \\"In the Greek geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Arad, Bahrain, which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples.\\"Arnold Heeren, p441 The people of Tyre in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words \\"Tylos\\" and \\"Tyre\\" has been commented upon. However, there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place. With the waning of Seleucid Greek power, Tylos was incorporated into Characene or Mesenian, the state founded in what today is Kuwait by Hyspaosines in 127 BCE. A building inscriptions found in Bahrain indicate that Hyspoasines occupied the islands, (and it also mention his wife, Thalassia). =Parthian and Sassanid= From the 3rd century BCE to arrival of Islam in the 7th century CE, Eastern Arabia was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and Sassanids. By about 250 BCE, the Seleucids lost their territories to Parthians, an Iranian tribe from Central Asia. The Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons in the southern coast of Persian Gulf.Bahrain By Federal Research Division, page 7 In the 3rd century CE, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and held the area until the rise of Islam four centuries later. Ardashir, the first ruler of the Iranian Sassanians dynasty marched down the Persian Gulf to Oman and Bahrain and defeated Sanatruq Robert G. Hoyland, Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam, Routledge 2001p28 (or Satiran), probably the Parthian governor of Eastern Arabia.Conflict and Cooperation: Zoroastrian Subalterns and Muslim Elites in ... By Jamsheed K. Choksy, 1997, page 75 He appointed his son Shapur I as governor of Eastern Arabia. Shapur constructed a new city there and named it Batan Ardashir after his father. At this time, Eastern Arabia incorporated the southern Sassanid province covering the Persian Gulf's southern shore plus the archipelago of Bahrain. The southern province of the Sassanids was subdivided into three districts of Haggar (Hofuf, Saudi Arabia), Batan Ardashir (al-Qatif province, Saudi Arabia), and Mishmahig (Muharraq, Bahrain; also referred to as Samahij) (In Middle-Persian/Pahlavi means \\"ewe- fish\\".Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a) which included the Bahrain archipelago that was earlier called Aval. The name, meaning 'ewe-fish' would appear to suggest that the name /Tulos/ is related to Hebrew /·π≠ƒÅleh/ 'lamb' (Strong's 2924).Strong's Hebrew and Aramaic Dictionary of Bible Words =Beth Qatraye= The Christian name used for the region encompassing north-eastern Arabia was Beth Qatraye, or \\"the Isles\\".\\"Nestorian Christianity in the Pre-Islamic UAE and Southeastern Arabia\\" , Peter Hellyer, Journal of Social Affairs, volume 18, number 72, winter 2011, p. 88 The name translates to 'region of the Qataris' in Syriac. It included Bahrain, Tarout Island, Al-Khatt, Al-Hasa, and Qatar. By the 5th century, Beth Qatraye was a major centre for Nestorian Christianity, which had come to dominate the southern shores of the Persian Gulf.Curtis E. Larsen. Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society University Of Chicago Press, 1984. As a sect, the Nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the Byzantine Empire, but eastern Arabia was outside the Empire's control offering some safety. Several notable Nestorian writers originated from Beth Qatraye, including Isaac of Nineveh, Dadisho Qatraya, Gabriel of Qatar and Ahob of Qatar.Kozah, Abu-Husayn, Abdulrahim. p. 1. Christianity's significance was diminished by the arrival of Islam in Eastern Arabia by 628. In 676, the bishops of Beth Qatraye stopped attending synods; although the practice of Christianity persisted in the region until the late 9th century. The dioceses of Beth Qatraye did not form an ecclesiastical province, except for a short period during the mid-to-late seventh century. They were instead subject to the Metropolitan of Fars. =Beth Mazunaye= Oman and the United Arab Emirates comprised the ecclesiastical province known as Beth Mazunaye. The name was derived from 'Mazun', the Persian name for Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

Minaean inscriptions have been found far afield of the Kingdom of Maƒ´in, as far away as al-≈™lƒÅ in northwestern Saudi Arabia and even on the island of Delos and Egypt. It was the first of the Yemeni kingdoms to end, and the Minaean language died around 100 CE .Nebes, Norbert. \\"Epigraphic South Arabian\\", Encyclopaedia: D-Ha pp. 334; Leonid Kogan and Andrey Korotayev: ·π¢ayhadic Languages (Epigraphic South Arabian) // Semitic Languages. London: Routledge, 1997, p. 157‚Äì183. =Kingdom of Saba (9th century BCE ‚Äì 275 CE)= During Sabaean rule, trade and agriculture flourished, generating much wealth and prosperity. The Sabaean kingdom was located in Yemen, and its capital, Ma'rib, is located near what is now Yemen's modern capital, Sana'a. According to South Arabian tradition, the eldest son of Noah, Shem, founded the city of Ma'rib. During Sabaean rule, Yemen was called \\"Arabia Felix\\" by the Romans, who were impressed by its wealth and prosperity. The Roman emperor Augustus sent a military expedition to conquer the \\"Arabia Felix\\", under the command of Aelius Gallus. After an unsuccessful siege of Ma'rib, the Roman general retreated to Egypt, while his fleet destroyed the port of Aden in order to guarantee the Roman merchant route to India. The success of the kingdom was based on the cultivation and trade of spices and aromatics including frankincense and myrrh. These were exported to the Mediterranean, India, and Abyssinia, where they were greatly prized by many cultures, using camels on routes through Arabia, and to India by sea. During the 8th and 7th century BCE, there was a close contact of cultures between the Kingdom of D ømt in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea and Saba. Though the civilization was indigenous and the royal inscriptions were written in a sort of proto-Ethiosemitic, there were also some Sabaean immigrants in the kingdom as evidenced by a few of the D ømt inscriptions.Sima, Alexander. \\"D ømt\\" in Siegbert Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 185.Munro-Hay, Stuart. Aksum: a Civilization of Late Antiquity, (Edinburgh: University Press, 1991), p. 58. Agriculture in Yemen thrived during this time due to an advanced irrigation system which consisted of large water tunnels in mountains, and dams. The most impressive of these earthworks, known as the Marib Dam, was built ca. 700 BCE and provided irrigation for about of land and stood for over a millennium, finally collapsing in 570 CE after centuries of neglect. =Kingdom of Hadhramaut (8th century BCE ‚Äì 3rd century CE)= The first known inscriptions of Hadramaut are known from the 8th century BCE. It was first referenced by an outside civilization in an Old Sabaic inscription of Karab'il Watar from the early 7th century BCE, in which the King of Hadramaut, Yada\`'il, is mentioned as being one of his allies. When the Minaeans took control of the caravan routes in the 4th century BCE, however, Hadramaut became one of its confederates, probably because of commercial interests. It later became independent and was invaded by the growing Yemeni kingdom of Himyar toward the end of the 1st century BCE, but it was able to repel the attack. Hadramaut annexed Qataban in the second half of the 2nd century CE, reaching its greatest size. The kingdom of Hadramaut was eventually conquered by the Himyarite king Shammar Yahri'sh around 300 CE, unifying all of the South Arabian kingdoms.M√ºller, Walter W. \\"·∏§a·∏çramawt\\"Encyclopaedia: D-Ha, pp. 965‚Äì66. =Kingdom of AwsƒÅn (8th century BCE ‚Äì 6th century BCE)= The ancient Kingdom of AwsƒÅn in South Arabia (modern Yemen), with a capital at ·∏§agar Ya·∏•irr in the wadi Markhah, to the south of the WƒÅdƒ´ Bay·∏•ƒÅn, is now marked by a tell or artificial mound, which is locally named ·∏§ajar Asfal. =Kingdom of Qataban (4th century BCE ‚Äì 3rd century CE)= Qataban was one of the ancient Yemeni kingdoms which thrived in the Beihan valley. Like the other Southern Arabian kingdoms, it gained great wealth from the trade of frankincense and myrrh incense, which were burned at altars. The capital of Qataban was named Timna and was located on the trade route which passed through the other kingdoms of Hadramaut, Saba and Ma'in. The chief deity of the Qatabanians was Amm, or \\"Uncle\\" and the people called themselves the \\"children of Amm\\". =Kingdom of Himyar (late 2nd century BCE ‚Äì 525 CE)= Statue of Ammaalay, 1st century BCE, Yemen The Himyarites rebelled against Qataban and eventually united Southwestern Arabia (Hejaz and Yemen), controlling the Red Sea as well as the coasts of the Gulf of Aden. From their capital city, ·∫íafƒÅr, the Himyarite kings launched successful military campaigns, and had stretched its domain at times as far east as eastern Yemen and as far north as NajranYule, Paul.

During the 3rd century CE, the South Arabian kingdoms were in continuous conflict with one another. Gadarat (GDRT) of Aksum began to interfere in South Arabian affairs, signing an alliance with Saba, and a Himyarite text notes that Hadramaut and Qataban were also allied against the kingdom. As a result of this, the Aksumite Empire was able to capture the Himyarite capital of Thifar in the first quarter of the 3rd century. However, the alliances did not last, and Sha\`ir Awtar of Saba unexpectedly turned on Hadramaut, allying again with Aksum and taking its capital in 225. Himyar then allied with Saba and invaded the newly taken Aksumite territories, retaking Thifar, which had been under the control of Gadarat's son Beygat, and pushing Aksum back into the Tihama.Sima, Alexander. \\"GDR(T)\\", Encyclopaedia: D-Ha, p. 718‚Äì9.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 72.

The 'Crowned Man' excavated from the Stone Building in Zafar. Aksumite occupation of Yemen (525 ‚Äì 570 CE) The Aksumite intervention is connected with Dhu Nuwas, a Himyarite king who changed the state religion to Judaism and began to persecute the Christians in Yemen. Outraged, Kaleb, the Christian King of Aksum with the encouragement of the Byzantine Emperor Justin I invaded and annexed Yemen. The Aksumites controlled Himyar and attempted to invade Mecca in the year 570 CE. Eastern Yemen remained allied to the Sassanids via tribal alliances with the Lakhmids, which later brought the Sassanid army into Yemen, ending the Aksumite period. Sassanid period (570 ‚Äì 630 CE) The Persian king Khosrau I sent troops under the command of Vahriz (), who helped the semi-legendary Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan to drive the Ethiopian Aksumites out of Yemen. Southern Arabia became a Persian dominion under a Yemenite vassal and thus came within the sphere of influence of the Sassanid Empire. After the demise of the Lakhmids, another army was sent to Yemen, making it a province of the Sassanid Empire under a Persian satrap. Following the death of Khosrau II in 628, the Persian governor in Southern Arabia, Badhan, converted to Islam and Yemen followed the new religion. Hejaz =Thamud= The Thamud () was an ancient civilization in Hejaz, which flourished from 3000 BCE to 200 BCE. Recent archaeological work has revealed numerous Thamudic rock writings and pictures. They are mentioned in sources such as the Qur'an, old Arabian poetry, Assyrian annals (Tamudi), in a Greek temple inscription from the northwest Hejaz of 169 CE, in a 5th- century Byzantine source and in Old North Arabian graffiti within Tayma. They are also mentioned in the victory annals of the Neo-Assyrian King, Sargon II (8th century BCE), who defeated these people in a campaign in northern Arabia. The Greeks also refer to these people as \\"Tamudaei\\", i.e. \\"Thamud\\", in the writings of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Pliny. Before the rise of Islam, approximately between 400‚Äì600 CE, the Thamud completely disappeared.

Xerxes I tomb relief. =Kingdom of Qedar (8th century BCE ‚Äì ?)= The most organized of the Northern Arabian tribes, at the height of their rule in the 6th century BCE, the Kingdom of Qedar spanned a large area between the Persian Gulf and the Sinai. An influential force between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE, Qedarite monarchs are first mentioned in inscriptions from the Assyrian Empire. Some early Qedarite rulers were vassals of that empire, with revolts against Assyria becoming more common in the 7th century BCE. It is thought that the Qedarites were eventually subsumed into the Nabataean state after their rise to prominence in the 2nd century CE. =The Achaemenids in Northern Arabia= Achaemenid Arabia corresponded to the lands between Egypt and Mesopotamia, later known as Arabia Petraea. According to Herodotus, Cambyses did not subdue the Arabs when he attacked Egypt in 525 BCE. His successor Darius the Great does not mention the Arabs in the Behistun Inscription from the first years of his reign, but mentions them in later texts. This suggests that Darius conquered this part of Arabia.Encyclopaedia Iranica =Nabateans= Al Khazneh in the ruins of Petra (Jordan) The Nabataeans are not to be found among the tribes that are listed in Arab genealogies because the Nabatean kingdom ended a long time before the coming of Islam. They settled east of the Syro-African rift between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, that is, in the land that had once been Edom. And although the first sure reference to them dates from 312 BCE, it is possible that they were present much earlier. Petra (from the Greek petra, meaning 'of rock') lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, east of Wadi \`Araba in Jordan about south of the Dead Sea. It came into prominence in the late 1st century BCE through the success of the spice trade. The city was the principal city of ancient Nabataea and was famous above all for two things: its trade and its hydraulic engineering systems. It was locally autonomous until the reign of Trajan, but it flourished under Roman rule. The town grew up around its Colonnaded Street in the 1st century and by the middle of the 1st century had witnessed rapid urbanization. The quarries were probably opened in this period, and there followed virtually continuous building through the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. =Roman Arabia= There is evidence of Roman rule in northern Arabia dating to the reign of Caesar Augustus (27 BCE ‚Äì 14 CE). During the reign of Tiberius (14‚Äì37 CE), the already wealthy and elegant north Arabian city of Palmyra, located along the caravan routes linking Persia with the Mediterranean ports of Roman Syria and Phoenicia, was made part of the Roman province of Syria. The area steadily grew further in importance as a trade route linking Persia, India, China, and the Roman Empire. During the following period of great prosperity, the Arab citizens of Palmyra adopted customs and modes of dress from both the Iranian Parthian world to the east and the Graeco-Roman west. In 129, Hadrian visited the city and was so enthralled by it that he proclaimed it a free city and renamed it Palmyra Hadriana. Map showing Roman emperor Trajan control of northwestern Arabia until Hegra (actual Mada'in Saleh) The Roman province of Arabia Petraea was created at the beginning of the 2nd century by emperor Trajan. It was centered on Petra, but included even areas of northern Arabia under Nabatean control. Recently has been discovered evidence that Roman legions occupied Mada'in Saleh in the Hijaz mountains area of northwestern Arabia, increasing the extension of the \\"Arabia Petraea\\" province. The desert frontier of Arabia Petraea was called by the Romans the Limes Arabicus. As a frontier province, it included a desert area of northeastern Arabia populated by the nomadic Saraceni. =Qahtanites= In Sassanid times, Arabia Petraea was a border province between the Roman and Persian empires, and from the early centuries CE was increasingly affected by South Arabian influence, notably with the Ghassanids migrating north from the 3rd century. *The Ghassanids revived the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized Syria. They mainly settled the Hauran region and spread to modern Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Jordan. The Ghassanids held Syria until engulfed by the expansion of Islam. Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Greeks called Yemen \\"Arabia Felix\\" (Happy Arabia). The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the Roman Empire \\"Arabia Petraea\\" after the city of Petra, and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east Arabia Magna (Larger Arabia) or Arabia Deserta (Deserted Arabia). *The Lakhmids settled the mid Tigris region around their capital Al-Hirah they ended up allying with the Sassanid against the Ghassanids and the Byzantine Empire. The Lakhmids contested control of the central Arabian tribes with the Kindites, eventually destroying Kindah in 540 after the fall of Kindah's main ally at the time, Himyar. The Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid kingdom in 602. *The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais Rabi'a tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arabia from Qaryah dhat Kahl (the present-day Qaryat al-FƒÅw) in Central Arabia. They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian Peninsula until the fall of the Himyarites in 525 CE. Central Arabia =Kingdom of Kindah= Kindah was an Arab kingdom by the Kindah tribe, the tribe's existence dates back to the second century BCE.D. H. M√ºller, Al-Hamdani, 53, 124, W. Caskel, Entdeckungen In Arabien, Koln, 1954, S. 9. Mahram, P.318 The Kindites established a kingdom in Najd in central Arabia unlike the organized states of Yemen; its kings exercised an influence over a number of associated tribes more by personal prestige than by coercive settled authority. Their first capital was Qaryat DhƒÅt KƒÅhil, today known as Qaryat Al-FƒÅw.History of Arabia ‚Äì Kindah . Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 11 February 2012. The Kindites were polytheistic until the 6th century CE, with evidence of rituals dedicated to the idols Athtar and KƒÅhil found in their ancient capital in south-central Arabia (present day Saudi Arabia). It is not clear whether they converted to Judaism or remained pagan, but there is a strong archaeological evidence that they were among the tribes in Dh≈´ NuwƒÅs' forces during the Jewish king's attempt to suppress Christianity in Yemen.Le Mus√©on, 3-4, 1953, P.296, Bulletin Of The School Of Oriental And African Studies, University Of London, Vol., Xvi, Part: 3, 1954, P.434, Ryckmans 508 They converted to Islam in mid 7th century CE and played a crucial role during the Arab conquest of their surroundings, although some sub-tribes declared apostasy during the ridda after the death of Mu·∏•ammad. Ancient South Arabian inscriptions mention a tribe settling in Najd called kdt, who had a king called rbÀÅt (Rabi‚Äôah) from ·∏èw ·πØwr-m (the people of Thawr), who had sworn allegiance to the king of Saba‚Äô and Dh≈´ RaydƒÅn.Jamme 635. See: JawƒÅd 'Alƒ´: Al- Mufa·π£·π£al fƒ´ TƒÅrƒ´kh al-'Arab Qabl al-Islam, Part 39. Since later Arab genealogists trace Kindah back to a person called Thawr ibn ‚ÄòUqayr, modern historians have concluded that this rbÀÅt ·∏èw ·πØwrm (Rabƒ´‚Äôah of the People of Thawr) must have been a king of Kindah (kdt); the Musnad inscriptions mention that he was king both of kdt (Kindah) and qhtn (Qa·∏•·π≠ƒÅn). They played a major role in the Himyarite-·∏§a·∏ëramite war. Following the Himyarite victory, a branch of Kindah established themselves in the Marib region, while the majority of Kindah remained in their lands in central Arabia. The first Classical author to mention Kindah was the Byzantine ambassador Nonnosos, who was sent by the Emperor Justinian to the area. He refers to the people in Greek as Khindynoi (Greek ŒßŒπŒΩŒ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒøŒπ, Arabic Kindah), and mentions that they and the tribe of Maadynoi (Greek: ŒúŒ±Œ±Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒøŒπ, Arabic: Ma'ad) were the two most important tribes in the area in terms of territory and number. He calls the king of Kindah Ka√Øsos (Greek: ŒöŒ±ŒπœÉŒøœÇ, Arabic: Qays), the nephew of Aretha (Greek: ŒÜœÅŒµŒ∏Œ±, Arabic: ·∏§ƒÅrith). People =Sedentary Arabs= Approximate locations of some of the important tribes and Empire of the Arabian Peninsula at the dawn of Islam (approximately 600 CE / 50 BH). Sedentary Arabs who inhabited cities or rural areas (towns, villages or oases). In pre-Islamic Arabia, most sedentary Arabs were of Arabian origin. =Bedouin tribes= Consisted many of major clans and the tribes were nomadic. The lineage followed through males, since the tribes were named after the male ancestors. =Solluba= The Solluba were a ·∏§utaymi tribal group in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula who were clearly distinguishable from the Arabs. The Solubba maintained a distinctive lifestyle as isolated nomads. The origin of the Solluba is obscure. They have been identified with the Selappayu in Akkadian records, and a clue to their origin is their use of desert kites and game traps, first attested to in around 7,000 BCE, which makes them the pre-Semitic inhabitants of Arabia. Cambridge linguist and anthropologist Roger Blench sees the Solubba as the last survivors of Palaeolithic hunters and salt-traders who once dominated Arabia. Those were assimilated in the next wave of humans consisted of cattle herders in the 6th millennium BCE who introduced cows, wild donkeys, sheep and dogs, wild camels and goats. Those peoples may have engaged in trade across the Red Sea with speakers of Cushitic or Nilo-Saharan. In the 3rd and 2nd millennium BCE speakers of Semitic languages arrived from the Near East and marginalised and absorbed the rest. Western travelers reported that the Bedouin did not consider the Solluba to be descendants of Qa·∏•·π≠ƒÅn. One legend mentions that they originated from ancient Christian groups, possibly Crusaders who were taken into slavery by the Bedouin. Werner Caskel criticizes the Crusader origin theory and instead proposes that the term \\"Solluba\\" describes a host of groups hailing from different backgrounds: those of al-·∏§asƒÅ being of 12th- to 13th-century CE migrants from southern Persia, and the group to the west being composed of communities emerging after their defeat by the Wahhabis. Another theory sees the Solubba as a former Bedouin group that lost their herds and fell in the eyes of other Bedouin. =Arab genealogical tradition= Arab traditions relating to the origins and classification of the Arabian tribes is based on biblical genealogy. The general consensus among 14th-century Arabic genealogists was that Arabs were three kinds: #\\"Perishing Arabs\\": These are the ancients of whose history little is known. They include  øƒÄd, Thamud, Tasm, Jadis, Imlaq and others. Jadis and Tasm perished because of genocide.  øƒÄd and Thamud perished because of their decadence. Some people in the past doubted their existence, but Imlaq is the singular form of 'Amaleeq and is probably synonymous to the biblical Amalek. #\\"Pure Arabs\\" (Qahtanite): These are traditionally considered to have originated from the progeny of Ya‚Äòrub bin Yashjub bin Qahtan so were also called Qahtanite Arabs. #\\"Arabized Arabs\\" (Adnanite): They are traditionally seen as having descended from Adnan. Modern historians believe that these distinctions were created during the Umayyad period, to support the cause of different political factions. \\"The 'arabicised or arabicising Arabs', on the contrary, are believed to be the descendants of Ishmael through Adnan, but in this case the genealogy does not match the Biblical line exactly. The label 'arabicised' is due to the belief that Ishmael spoke Hebrew until he got to Mecca, where he married a Yemeni woman and learnt Arabic. Both genealogical lines go back to Sem, son of Noah, but only Adnanites can claim Abraham as their ascendant, and the lineage of Mohammed, the Seal of Prophets (khatim al- anbiya'), can therefore be traced back to Abraham. Contemporary historiography unveiled the lack of inner coherence of this genealogical system and demonstrated that it finds insufficient matching evidence; the distinction between Qahtanites and Adnanites is even believed to be a product of the Umayyad Age, when the war of factions (al-niza al-hizbi) was raging in the young Islamic Empire.\\" The several different Bedouin tribes throughout Arabian history are traditionally regarded as having emerged from two main branches: the Rabi\`ah, from which amongst others the Banu Hanifa emerged, and the Mudhar, from which amongst others the Banu Kinanah (and later Muhammad's own tribe, the Quraysh) emerged. Religion Rising from a roundel, the sculpture represents a priestess who intercedes with the sun goddess on behalf of the donor, Rathadum Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia included polytheism, Christianity, Judaism, and Iranian religions. Arabian polytheism, the dominant form of religion in pre-Islamic Arabia, was based on veneration of deities and spirits. Worship was directed to various gods and goddesses, including Hubal and the goddesses al-LƒÅt, Al-‚ÄòUzz√° and ManƒÅt, at local shrines and temples such as the Kaaba in Mecca. Deities were venerated and invoked through a variety of rituals, including pilgrimages and divination, as well as ritual sacrifice. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in Meccan religion. Many of the physical descriptions of the pre-Islamic gods are traced to idols, especially near the Kaaba, which is said to have contained up to 360 of them. Other religions were represented to varying, lesser degrees. The influence of the adjacent Roman, Aksumite and Sasanian Empires resulted in Christian communities in the northwest, northeast and south of Arabia. Christianity made a lesser impact, but secured some conversions, in the remainder of the peninsula. With the exception of Nestorianism in the northeast and the Persian Gulf, the dominant form of Christianity was Miaphysitism. The peninsula had been a destination for Jewish migration since Roman times, which had resulted in a diaspora community supplemented by local converts. Additionally, the influence of the Sasanian Empire resulted in Iranian religions being present in the peninsula. While Zoroastrianism existed in the eastern and southern Arabia, there was no existence of Manichaeism in Mecca. Art The art is similar to that of neighbouring cultures.

Exhibition \\"Roads of Arabia\\": Funeral mask and glove (1st century AD), gold, from Thaj, Tell Al-Zayer (National Museum, Riyadh) Late Antiquity The early 7th century in Arabia began with the longest and most destructive period of the Byzantine‚ÄìSassanid Wars. It left both the Byzantine and Sassanid empires exhausted and susceptible to third-party attacks, particularly from nomadic Arabs united under a newly-formed religion. According to historian George Liska, the \\"unnecessarily prolonged Byzantine‚ÄìPersian conflict opened the way for Islam\\". The demographic situation also favoured Arab expansion: overpopulation and lack of resources encouraged Arabs to migrate out of Arabia. Compare: =Fall of the Empires= Before the Byzantine‚ÄìSassanid War of 602‚Äì628, the Plague of Justinian had erupted (541-542), spreading through Persia and into Byzantine territory. The Byzantine historian Procopius, who witnessed the plague, documented that citizens died at a rate of 10,000 per day in Constantinople.\\"Bury, John.\\", \\"A history of the later Roman empire: from Arcadius to Irene.\\", \\"(New York: 1889)\\", \\"401\\" The exact number; however, is often disputed by contemporary historians. Both empires were permanently weakened by the pandemic as their citizens struggled to deal with death as well as heavy taxation, which increased as each empire campaigned for more territory. Despite almost succumbing to the plague, Byzantine emperor Justinian I (reigned 527-565) attempted to resurrect the might of the Roman Empire by expanding into Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula had a long coastline for merchant ships and an area of lush vegetation known as the Fertile Crescent which could help fund his expansion into Europe and North Africa. The drive into Persian territory would also put an end to tribute payments to the Sasanians, which resulted in an agreement to give of tribute to the Persians annually in exchange for a ceasefire.\\"Sicker, Martin\\", \\"The Pre-Islamic Middle East\\",\\"(Connecticut:2000)\\", \\"201.\\" However, Justinian could not afford further losses in Arabia. The Byzantines and the Sasanians sponsored powerful nomadic mercenaries from the desert with enough power to trump the possibility of aggression in Arabia. Justinian viewed his mercenaries as so valued for preventing conflict that he awarded their chief with the titles of patrician, phylarch, and king ‚Äì the highest honours that he could bestow on anyone.\\"Egger, Vernon\\", \\"Origins\\" in A History of the Muslim World to 1405: The Making of a Civilization\\", \\"(New Jersey: 2005)\\", \\"10\\" By the late 6th century, an uneasy peace remained until disagreements erupted between the mercenaries and their patron empires. The Byzantines' ally was a Christian Arabic tribe from the frontiers of the desert known as the Ghassanids. The Sasanians' ally; the Lakhmids, were also Christian Arabs, but from what is now Iraq. However, denominational disagreements about God forced a schism in the alliances. The Byzantines' official religion was Orthodox Christianity, which believed that Jesus Christ and God were two natures within one entity.\\"Ware, Timothy\\", \\"The Orthodox Church\\", \\"(New York:1997)\\", \\"67 ‚Äì 69\\" The Ghassanids, as Monophysite Christians from Iraq, believed that God and Jesus Christ were only one nature.\\"Bowersock\\", \\"Brown\\", and \\"Grabar\\", \\"\\"Alphabetical Guide\\" in Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Post-Classical World\\", \\"(Cambridge: 2000)\\", \\"469\\". This disagreement proved irreconcilable and resulted in a permanent break in the alliance. Meanwhile, the Sassanid Empire broke its alliance with the Lakhmids due to false accusations that the Lakhmids' leader had committed treason; the Sasanians annexed the Lakhmid kingdom in 602.\\"Singh, Nagendra\\", \\"International encyclopaedia of Islamic dynasties\\", \\"(India: 2005)\\", \\"75\\" The fertile lands and important trade routes of Iraq were now open ground for upheaval. =Rise of Islam= thumb|250px|right|Expansion of the caliphate, 622‚Äì750 CE. When the military stalemate was finally broken and it seemed that Byzantium had finally gained the upper hand in battle, nomadic Arabs invaded from the desert frontiers, bringing with them a new social order that emphasized religious devotion over tribal membership. By the time the last Byzantine-Sassanid war came to an end in 628, Arabia had started to unite under Muhammad's politico-religious leadership. The Muslims were able to launch attacks against both empires, which resulted in destruction of the Sassanid Empire and the conquest of Byzantium's territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, Syria and North Africa. Over the following centuries, most of the Byzantine Empire and the entirety of the Sassanid Empire came under Muslim rule. > \\"Within the lifetime of some of the children who met Muhammad and sat on the > Prophet's knees, Arab armies controlled the land mass that extended from the > Pyrenees Mountains in Europe to the Indus River valley in South Asia.

Archaeological researchers from France, Saudi Arabia and Italy, headed by Olivia Munoz believe that these findings illuminate a pastoralist nomadic lifestyle and a ritual used in prehistoric Arabia.

Opened in 1889, the Grocery was a cooperative venture run along corporate lines and owned by 11 prominent African Americans, including postman Thomas Moss, a friend of Ida B. Wells. In March 1892, in the aftermath of a fight outside the store, Thomas Moss and two of his workers, Will Stewart and Calvin McDowell, were lynched by a white mob while in police custody.  Leadup to the lynching  =March 2-4, 1892= By the 1890s there were increasing racial tensions in the neighborhood and increasing tensions between the successful Moss and white grocer William Barrett, whose grocery, despite its bad reputation as a \\"low-dive gambling den\\" and a location where liquor could be illegally purchased, had had a virtual monopoly prior to Moss's venture. On Wednesday, March 2, 1892, the trouble began when a young black boy, Armour Harris, and a young white boy, Cornelius Hurst, got into a fight over a game of marbles outside the People's Grocery. When the white boy's father stepped in and began beating the black boy, two black workers from the grocery (Will Stewart and Calvin McDowell) came to his defense. More blacks and whites joined the fray, and at one point William Barrett was clubbed. He identified Will Stewart as his assailant. On Thursday, March 3, Barrett returned to the People's Grocery with a police officer and were met by Calvin McDowell. McDowell told them no one matching Stewart's description was within the store. The frustrated Barrett hit McDowell with his revolver and knocked him down, dropping the gun in the process. McDowell picked it up and shot at Barrett, but missed. McDowell was subsequently arrested but released on bond on March 4. Warrants were also issued for Will Stewart and Armour Harris. The warrants enraged the black residents of the neighborhood who called a meeting during which they vowed to clean out the neighborhood's \\"damned white trash\\", which Barrett brought to the authorities' attention as evidence of a black conspiracy against whites. =March 5-8, 1892= On Saturday, March 5, Judge Julius DuBose, a former Confederate soldier, was quoted in the Appeal-Avalanche newspaper as vowing to form a posse to get rid of the \\"high-handed rowdies\\" in the Curve. That same day John Mosby, a black painter, was fatally shot after an altercation with a clerk in another white grocery in the Curve; as reported in the Appeal-Avalanche, Mosby cursed at the clerk after being denied credit for a purchase and the clerk responded by punching him. Mosby returned that evening and hit the clerk with a stick, whereupon the clerk shot him. The People's Grocery men were increasingly concerned about an attack upon them, based on Dubose's threat and the Mosby shooting. They consulted a lawyer but were told since they were outside the city limits they could not depend on police protection and should prepare to defend themselves. On the evening of March 5, six armed white men‚Äîincluding a county sheriff and recently deputized plainclothes civilians‚Äîheaded toward the People's Grocery. White papers claimed their purpose was to inquire after Will Stewart and arrest him if he was there. In an account written by five black ministers in the St. Paul Appeal, the men were said to arrive with a rout in mind, for they had first gone to William Barrett's place then divided up and surreptitiously posted themselves at the front and back entrance to the People's Grocery. The men inside, already anticipating a mob attack, were being surrounded by armed whites and did not know they were officers of the law. When the whites entered the store they were shot at and several were hit; McDowell was captured at the scene and identified as an assailant. The black postman Nat Trigg was seized by deputy Charley Cole but Trigg shot Cole in the face and managed to escape. The injured whites retreated to Barrett's store and more deputized whites were dispatched to the grocery where they eventually arrested thirteen blacks and seized a cache of weapons and ammunition. Reports in white papers described the shooting as a cold-blooded, calculated ambush by the blacks and, though none of the deputies had died, they predicted the wounds of Cole and Bob Harold, who was shot in the face and neck, would prove fatal. The five ministers writing in theSt. Paul Appeal said as soon as the black men realized the intruders were law officers they dropped their weapons and submitted to arrest, confident they would be able to explain their case in court. =March 5-8, 1892= On Sunday, March 6, hundreds of white civilians were deputized and fanned out from the grocery to conduct a house-to-house search for blacks involved in \\"the conspiracy\\". They eventually arrested forty black people, including Armour Harris and his mother, Nat Trigg, and Tommie Moss. The story in the black paper contended that Moss was tending his books at the back of the store on the night of the shooting and couldn't have seen what happened when the whites arrived. When he heard gunshots he left the premises. In the eyes of many whites, however, Moss' position as a postman and the president of the co-op made him a ringleader of the conspiracy. He was also indicted in the white press for an insolent attitude when he was arrested. Upon news of the arrest armed whites congregated around the fortress-like Shelby County Jail. Members of the black Tennessee Rifles militia also posted themselves outside the jail to keep watch and guard against a lynching. On Monday, March 7, Tommie's pregnant wife Betty Moss came to jail with food for her husband but was turned away by Judge DuBose who told her to come back again in three days. On Tuesday, March 8, lawyers for several of the black men filed writs of habeas corpus but DuBose quashed them. After news filtered out that the injured deputies were not going to die the tensions outside the jail seemed to abate and the Tennessee Rifles thought it was no longer necessary to guard the jail grounds, especially as the Shelby County Jail itself was thought to be impregnable. But, as Ida B. Wells would write in retrospect, the news that the deputies would survive was actually a catalyst for violence for the black men could not now be legally executed for their crime.  The lynching, March 9, 1892 On Wednesday, March 9, at about 2:30 a.m. 75 men in black masks surrounded the Shelby County Jail and nine entered. They dragged Tommie Moss, Will Stewart, and Calvin McDowell from their cells and brought them to a Chesapeake & Ohio railroad yard a mile outside of Memphis.https://lynchingsitesmem.org/news/how-location-peoples-grocery- lynching-was-rediscovered What followed was described in such harrowing detail by white papers that it was clear reporters had been called in advance to witness the lynching. At the railroad yard McDowell \\"struggled mightily\\" and at one point managed to grab a shotgun from one of his abductors. After the mob wrested it from him they shot at his hands and fingers \\"inch by inch\\" until they were shot to pieces. Replicating the wounds the white deputies had suffered they shot four holes into McDowell's face, each large enough for a fist to enter. His left eye was shot out and the \\"ball hung over his cheek in shreds.\\" His jaw was torn out by buckshot. Where \\"his right eye had been there was a big hole which his brains oozed out.\\" The account by the five ministers in the Appeal-Avalanche added that his injuries were in accord with his \\"vicious and unyielding nature.\\" Will Stewart was described as the most stoic of the three, \\"obdurate and unyielding to the last.\\" He was also shot on the right side of the neck with a shotgun, and was shot with a pistol in the neck and left eye. Moss was also shot in the neck; his dying words, reported in the papers, were: \\"Tell my people to go West, there is no justice for them here.\\"  Aftermath  Cover of Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases The murders led to increasing grief and unrest among the black population, along with rumors that blacks planned to meet at the People's Grocery and take revenge against whites. Judge DuBose ordered the sheriff to take possession of the swords and guns belonging to the Tennessee Rifles and to dispatch a hundred men to the People's Grocery where they should \\"shoot down on sight any Negro who appears to be making trouble.\\" Gangs of armed white men rushed to the Curve and began shooting wildly into any groups of blacks they encountered, then looted the grocery. Subsequently, the grocery was sold for one-eighth its cost to William Barrett. The lynching became a front-page story in the New York Times on March 10, which countered the image of the \\"New South\\" that Memphis was trying to promote. The lynching sparked national outrage, and Ida B. Wells' editorial embraced Moss' dying words, which encouraged blacks to strike out for the West and \\"leave a town which will neither protect our lives and property, nor give us a fair trial in the courts, but takes us out and murders us in cold blood when accused by white persons.\\" This sparked an emigration movement that eventually saw 6,000 blacks leave Memphis for the Western Territories. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church in Chicago in response to this lynching as well as two earlier lynchings (Ed Coy in Texarkana, Arkansas, and a woman in Rayville, Louisiana), a call by the presiding minister for the crowd to sing the then de facto national anthem, \\"America (My Country, 'Tis of Thee)\\" was refused in protest, and the song, \\"John Brown's Body\\" was substituted. The widespread violence and particularly the murder of her friends drove Wells to research and document lynchings and their causes. She began investigative journalism by looking at the charges given for the murders, which officially started her anti-lynching campaign.

He created the popular character Michael Lanyard, a criminal-turned-detective known as The Lone Wolf. Biography Louis Joseph Vance was born September 19, 1879, in Washington, D. C., the only child of Wilson J. Vance, a Medal of Honor recipient, and Lillian Beall Vance. He was educated at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. Vance was married to Anne Elizabeth Hodges on February 19, 1898. Their son, Wilson Beall Vance, was born in 1900. He wrote short stories and verse after 1901, then composed many popular novels. His character Michael Lanyard, known as The Lone Wolf, was featured in eight books and 24 films between 1914 and 1949 and also appeared in radio and television series. Vance moved to Los Angeles to work with Universal Pictures on films based on his work, including The Trey o' Hearts (1914) and a serial and film series (1914‚Äì1916) based on his Terence O'Rourke stories. In 1915, he founded Fiction Pictures, Inc., a motion picture production company whose films were distributed by Paramount Pictures. Its first release was The Spanish Jade (1915), with a screenplay by Vance based on his stage adaptation of a novel by Maurice Hewlett. Vance was president and general manager of the company; other principals were Wilfred Lucas (director-general), Gilbert Warrenton (cinematographer) and Bess Meredyth (scenario editor). Fiction Pictures operated in Glendale until a new studio in Hollywood was completed in April 1915. The studio was sold to Famous Players in June, when Fiction Pictures went out of business. Vance died alone in his New York City apartment on December 16, 1933, in a fire that resulted from his falling asleep with a lighted cigarette. His death was ruled accidental. A simple funeral took place December 20, 1933, at St. George's Protestant Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, with honorary pallbearers including Marc Connelly, Will Irwin and Samuel Merwin. Vance's widow received an estate of less than $10,000.

He seems to have advocated a moderate democratic policy, opposing motions to expand the franchise and restore the levels of pay for civil service that had typified the golden days of Periclean democracy in Athens in the mid-5th century BC.

Political history Mario Bachand was a member of the Front de Liberation du Quebec, imprisoned for his role in planting bombs in Montreal. On 17 May 1963 a bomb crippled Walter Leja, a Canadian army explosives technician. After his release, Bachand remained politically active in Montreal, founding several activist, leftist movements. He was an effective organizer, and was largely responsible for organizing the McGill-fran√ßais demonstration of March 1969. He was close friends with Jacques Lanct√¥t, who in 1970 would lead the Liberation Cell in the kidnapping of British diplomat James Cross, the event that initiated the October Crisis. Bachand had earlier fled Canada to avoid another criminal prosecution. Bachand and Lanct√¥t were close friends with a young man born in France, Richard Bros. On 22 November 1970, during the October Crisis, days before the Liberation Cell released their hostage, Bros would die in a London police cell, reportedly a suicide. In April 1969 Bachand fled to Havana, where he met up with other FLQ who had sought refuge in Cuba, including Pierre Charette, Alain Allard and Raymond Villeneuve. Bachand was very much a socialist, and did not view Quebec nationalism, particularly its Parti Qu√©b√©cois manifestation, very positively. This brought him in conflict with certain other FLQ who were more sovereigntist, such as Raymond Villeneuve and Denis Lamoureux. Death In June 1970 he left Cuba for Paris.

He is known for founding and developing the retirement community of Sun City, Arizona, and for many works of his firm, Del E. Webb Construction Company. Early years Webb was born in Fresno, California, to Ernest G. Webb, a fruit farmer, and Henrietta S. Webb. He dropped out of high school to become a carpenter's apprentice, and in 1919, he married Hazel Lenora Church, a graduate nurse. In 1920, Webb was a ship fitter, and they were living with his parents and two younger brothers in Placer County, California. At the age of 28, he suffered typhoid fever, and as a result moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to recover. Career In 1928, Webb began his namesake company which was a construction contractor. He received many military contracts during World War II, including the construction of the Poston War Relocation Center near Parker. Poston interned over 17,000 Japanese-Americans and at the time was the third largest \\"city\\" in Arizona. Webb was associated with Howard Hughes and played golf with Hughes, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Barry Goldwater. A former semi-professional baseball player and a lifelong fan, Webb and partners Dan Topping and Larry MacPhail purchased the New York Yankees in 1945 for $2.8 million from the estate of Col. Jake Ruppert Jr. After buying out MacPhail in October 1947, Webb and Topping remained owners of the Yankees until selling the club to CBS in 1964. During those 20 seasons, the Yankees were in 15 World Series and won 10 of them. In 1946 and 1947, mob boss Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel hired Webb as the general contractor for the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. After boasting about his claim that he'd personally had killed 16 men, Siegel said to Webb, \\"Del, don't worry, we only kill each other.\\"Jennings, We Only Kill Each Other. (1992). p. 17The Green Felt Jungle In 1948, Webb was contracted to build 600 houses and a shopping center called Pueblo Gardens in Tucson, Arizona. San Manuel, Arizona, a mining company town and currently a resort town, followed. Established in 1953, the town was built by Webb (along with M.O.W. Homes Inc.) for The Magma Copper Company. It required the building of streets, shopping centers, schools, a hospital and parks. This was a prelude to Sun City, Arizona, which was launched January 1, 1960, with five home models, a shopping center, recreation center and golf course. The opening weekend drew 100,000 people, ten times more than expected, and resulted in a Time magazine cover story. In between these two projects, in 1951, Webb was given the huge contract to build the Hughes Missile Plant (now Raytheon) in Tucson, Arizona.David Leighton, The History of the Hughes Missile Plant in Tucson, 1947-1960, Private Publication, 2015 [Page 5] Personal life Del Webb Memorial Hospital Del Webb Boulevard In 1919, Webb married his childhood sweetheart, Hazel Lenora Church. They divorced in 1952. In 1961, Webb married Toni Ince, then aged 41, a buyer for Bullocks Wilshire department store in Los Angeles. Toni Ince Webb lived in Beverly Hills, California, until her death in 2008. =Death and legacy= Webb died at age 75 in Rochester, Minnesota, at the Mayo Clinic, following surgery for lung cancer, less than two months after Topping's death. Webb was portrayed by Andy Romano in the 1991 film Bugsy. Webb was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2000. The Del Webb Middle School, named in his honor, opened in Henderson, Nevada, in 2005.

Acoustic Research, under Villchur's leadership, was also innovative during this period in the way the company offered equal opportunity, liberal employee benefits, insurance, and profit sharing to every employee.Acoustic Research Employee Handbook, November, 1969, Acoustic Research, Inc. 24 Thorndike Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02141 =Acoustic suspension loudspeaker= The acoustic suspension woofer provided an elegant solution to the age-old problem of bass distortion in loudspeakers caused by non-linear, mechanical suspensions in conventional loudspeakers. The state-of-the-art at the time of AR's invention was the bass reflex speaker, which boosted bass response for a given amount of cone travel by directing sound energy from the rear of the speaker cone through a port in the cabinet \\"tuned\\" for reinforcement of the direct signal from the front of the cone by the signal from the rear of the cone. Amongst the drawbacks of that system are the stringent design parameters for successfully achieving accurate bass reinforcement, requiring great precision and, with the technology of the day, large cabinets. Some loss of accuracy (\\"smearing\\" or \\"vooming\\" of low frequencies) was inevitable and the results of specific designs were not entirely predictable. The making of many prototypes drove up the development costs of new designs, keeping them out of popular price ranges. High fidelity woofers were also vulnerable to damage from extreme low frequency signals. Those issues were addressed with the invention of the acoustic suspension woofer. The acoustic suspension woofer (sometimes known as ‚Äúair suspension‚Äù) used the elasticity of air within a small, sealed enclosure of about to provide the restoring force for the woofer cone. The entrapped air of the sealed-loudspeaker enclosure (unlike the mechanical springs of conventional speakers) provided an (almost) linear spring for the woofer's diaphragm, enabling it to move back and forth great distances (‚Äúexcursion‚Äù) in a linear fashion: a requirement in the reproduction of deep bass tones. The disadvantage of this arrangement is low efficiency. Since the restoring force is large with a large woofer in a small cabinet, the cone must be massive to keep the resonant frequency in the required low bass region. The AR-1s were about 10 per cent as efficient as other (physically much larger) existing speakers with the same bass response, but since higher power amplifiers were becoming available about the same time, this was a reasonable trade-off to get good bass response from a relatively small speaker. The AR-1 set new standards of low-frequency performance and low distortion that were unsurpassed for many years and some of the best loudspeakers available fifty-two years later continue to use the acoustic suspension principle for highest quality, low distortion bass reproduction. The small size of the high performance AR-1 (permitted by the acoustic suspension design) helped usher in the age of stereophonic sound reproduction. Two bookshelf-sized loudspeakers were far more acceptable in a living room than the two refrigerator-sized boxes previously necessary to reproduce low frequency bass notes. By March 1957, AR began shipping a smaller, less expensive, acoustic suspension system, the US$87 Model AR-2. The AR-2 was selected by Consumer Reports as a 'best buy' and the company's sales went from $383,000 in 1956 to nearly $1,000,000 by the end of 1957. Also that year, co-founder and Vice President Henry Kloss left AR to form a new loudspeaker company, KLH. AR-3 loudspeaker In 1958, AR once again pioneered loudspeaker technology with the introduction of the landmark model AR-3, which used the AR-1‚Äôs acoustic-suspension woofer in conjunction with the first commercially available hemispherical (‚Äúdome‚Äù) mid-frequency midrange unit (squawker) and high-frequency tweeter. For nearly ten years after its introduction, the AR-3 was widely regarded as the most accurate loudspeaker available at any cost, and was used in many professional installations, recording studios, and concert halls. Many well-known professional musicians used AR-3 loudspeakers because of their excellent sound reproduction. In the early 1960s, AR conducted a series of over 75 live vs. recorded demonstrations throughout the United States in which the sound of a live string quartet was alternated with echo-free recorded music played through a pair of AR-3s. In this ‚Äúultimate‚Äù subjective test of audio quality, the listeners were largely unable to detect the switch from live to recorded, a strong testament to Acoustic Research's audio quality.http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/villchur.html The company also established music demonstration rooms on the mezzanine of Grand Central Terminal in New York City and on a street corner of Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the public could stop by and listen to its products, but no sales were made there. This low-key marketing innovation caused a major increase in the company's business. The AR-3 was subsequently replaced by the AR-3a in 1969, with a new dome midrange and tweeter reduced in dimensions, for even better mid and high frequency dispersion. On September 13, 1993, an AR-3 was placed on permanent display in the Information Age Exhibit of National Museum of American History at The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The AR-3a was subsequently replaced by the AR-11 and AR-10pi in 1977, which both shared the same improved tweeter and midrange domes. The 10pi even had woofer/bass response adjustment switches to allow for a variety of room placements. The new tweeter used in the AR-11/10pi had notably brighter high-frequency response partly to compensate for less dispersion than the tweeter of the AR3a. AR went on to introduce many other notable designs, and by 1966 the company had grown to hold 32.2% of the U.S. domestic loudspeaker market, based on the IHFM and High Fidelity surveys statistics for that year. This was the largest product market share ever held by a loudspeaker manufacturer since statistics have been kept in the industry. Turntables AR also produced a low-cost ($78) belt-drive turntable, a type of phonograph, using a cast aluminum 3.3 lb (1.5 kg) turntable platter suspended with a T-bar sub-chassis that greatly reduced acoustic feedback. A 24-pole hysteresis-synchronous, permanent magnet Hurst AC motor propelled the platter via a precision ground rubber belt to produce very low wow and flutter, exceeding the NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) standards for turntable measurements.AR Turntable History Acoustic Research Ed Villchur Vinyl Nirvana Many AR turntable models AR Turntable Models Vinyl Nirvana are still sought after today. In particular, the mid-1980s models are highly modifiable to become first-rate vinyl playback units. Teledyne buyout  In 1967, Acoustic Research was bought by Teledyne, Inc., and for the next 22 years it continued development and operations in Cambridge as Teledyne Acoustic Research. Technological breakthroughs in this period included the high-current amplifier. When purchased by Teledyne, AR was the world's second largest supplier of branded loudspeakers. Although Acoustic Research had continued in product development, by 1989 AR had dropped to fifth place worldwide, and Teledyne sold the company to their major competitor, Jensen Electronics. In 1996, Jensen, including AR, was sold to Recoton Audio Corporation. Under both Jensen and Recoton, the AR brand continued to make technology breakthroughs in the speaker industry; these included the environmental controls that allowed a speaker to be placed in different room areas, the Acoustic Blanket that minimized diffraction and interference in speaker baffles, and a speaker line designed to complement home theater and the digital technologies of the 1990s. In 2003, Audiovox (now Voxx International) acquired the U.S. audio operations of Recoton, and continues with AR-brand speaker development and sales. An associated firm, AB Tech Services (http://www.abtechservices.com), provided maintenance of AR speakers until mid 2014. Web-based audiophile communities lamented the closure of the company and apparent liquidation of stock. As of July 2014 CM Tech Support took over the responsibility of providing Acoustic Research Parts and Service (http://www.cmtechsupport.com).

It is the first part of the Imriel Trilogy, followed by Kushiel's Justice and Kushiel's Mercy.  Plot summary  To find his lost mother, the mission of his foster mother and his own personal quest, he must discover who trained Ph√®dre n√≥ Delaunay's mentor, Anafiel Delaunay. Imriel de la Courcel's blood parents are history's most reviled traitors, but his adoptive parents, the Comtesse Ph√®dre and the warrior-priest Joscelin, are Terre d'Ange's greatest champions. Stolen, tortured, and enslaved as a young boy, Imriel is now a Prince of the Blood, third in line for the throne in a land that revels in art, beauty, and desire. It is a court steeped in deeply laid conspiracies ... and there are many who would see the young prince dead. Some despise him out of hatred for his birth mother Melisande, who nearly destroyed the realm in her quest for power. Others because they fear he has inherited his mother's irresistible allure - and her dangerous gifts. And as he comes of age, plagued by dark yearnings, Imriel shares their fears. At the royal court, where gossip is the chosen poison and assailants wield slander instead of swords, the young prince fights character assassins while struggling with his own innermost conflicts. But when Imriel departs to study at the famed University of Tiberium, the perils he faces turn infinitely more deadly. Searching for wisdom, he finds instead a web of manipulation, where innocent words hide sinister meanings, and your lover of last night may become your hired killer before dawn. Now a simple act of friendship will leave Imriel trapped in a besieged city where the infamous Melisande is worshiped as a goddess; where a dead man leads an army; and where the prince must face his greatest test: to find his true self.

It is the sequel to Kushiel's Scion. Kushiel's Scion is itself the sequel to the Kushiel's Legacy Trilogy (Kushiel's Dart, Kushiel's Chosen, and Kushiel's Avatar). Since they are directly connected, this is at times described as the fifth in a series; however, it is also often described as the second of the latter series, dubbed the 'Imriel Trilogy'.  Imriel de la Courcel  Imriel n√≥ Montr√®ve de la Courcel is the son of the great-uncle of the D'Angeline Queen Ysandre de la Courcel. His mother, Melisande Shahrizai, is a traitor who twice attempted to seize the D'Angeline throne, once with the help of his father, Benedicte de la Courcel. Rescued from slavery by Ph√®dre n√≥ Delaunay and her consort Joscelin Verreuil in Kushiel's Avatar, he is formally adopted into House Montr√®ve and begins to understand his history and that of his blood relatives. Despite his being the son of two infamous traitors, he is also the adoptive son of the realms perhaps most loyal royalists. He has no aspirations for the throne and is ashamed of his heritage. After having studied at the University of Tiberium (see Kushiel's Scion), he has now returned to Terre d'Ange and agreed to marry the Alban Princess Dorelei.  Plot summary  = The Forbidden = The novel begins with Imriel sitting down to read the letters that his mother, Melisande Shahrizai, has written him all these years. After the occurrences in Kushiel's Scion, especially with Canis in Lucca, he is now concerned with where she is and the influence she is trying to have on his life. The letters, while not exactly comforting, tell him much and help soothe some of his resentment. Ph√®dre n√≥ Delaunay, his foster-mother, asks him if he wants to discuss them but he declines. When he presents himself to the Queen, he tells her his decision to wed the Alban Princess Dorelei. He met her when he was eighteen and Prince Talorcan, Drustan's nephew and heir apparent, came to visit. While Drustan would like to name Alais as his heir, he cannot without risking another civil war. If Alais were to wed Talorcan, she would rule at his side but their children wouldn't inherit the throne, as Alba works by matrilineal succession. However, if Imriel were to wed Dorelei, his son would become Cruarch and Terre d'Ange's influence in Alba would not wane. For this reason, he agrees to wed Dorelei to preserve stability. At the same time, however, he has discovered that he is attracted to his cousin, Sidonie de la Courcel. He knows that she feels the same. He is still the son of two infamous traitors and she is the dauphine. They cannot be together. Despite this, during the Midwinter Masque at the palace, Imriel and Sidonie kiss, and a secret relationship begins. Only Sidonie's lady-in-waiting, Amarante, and Imriel's best friend, Mavros, know of their relationship. They often assist Imriel and Sidonie and warn them if people are going to burst in and see them together. Because of his impending wedding, Imriel begins to take lessons with Alais on Alban history, law, religion, and linguistic nuances. After these classes he would often meet Sidonie at her quarters and then they would use their few hours alone to make love. While Alais does not approve of their relationship, predominantly due to the necessary secrecy, she does nothing to stop them. During one of these lustful afternoons, Imriel tells Sidonie about what happened to him in Drujan (see Kushiel's Avatar). She listens calmly but is greatly saddened. She then asks whether he would still be willing to be cruel with her because she would very much like it. For once Imriel seems to be more comfortable and willing to try this, as long as it is with her. Their relationship continues until the wedding. Imriel begins to get very frustrated that his consent to the wedding will soon rob him of another of the people he loves. He and Sidonie know they cannot be together and they suspect that they only like each other because it is forbidden. To release this frustration, Mavros takes him to Valerian House once again. Given that Imriel has been drinking, however, Mavros books them a showing rather than participating directly. This helps Imriel to deal with his past and the frustration caused by his situation and his Kusheline blood. = The Wedding = That summer, Prince Talorcan and Princess Dorelei accompany Drustan on his annual trip to Terre d'Ange in the spring. Dorelei is sweet and kind-hearted, but Imriel is distracted with his love for Sidonie. He still agrees to wed Dorelei though, because, as Sidonie herself said, they are likely only in love with each other because it is forbidden. As well, Sidonie is not yet eighteen and therefore can not cross her mother's will, making any true relationship with Imriel impossible. Even still, Imriel is sad to be leaving her. Dorelei, sensing that he loves another, says she is willing to share him, as she knows D'Angelines do, but that she herself will be only with him, as is Alban custom. Imriel takes this to heart but assures her there is no one else. Before the wedding, Imriel and Sidonie meet secretly at a Temple of Elua. There the Priest vows to keep his silence but discourages the two from being so secretive and continuing a relationship that will inevitably hurt others. Nevertheless, he provides them with a private room for their final love-making. Mavros Shahrizai also takes him on a bachelor's party. Imriel is frustrated, angry, and rough, being in the perfect mood for Valerian House. Mavros, however, makes sure that Imriel does not get carried away and is always safe and sane in his play. The next morning is the wedding. This is a public affair with all persons of import in attendance. They are given many gifts, though Imriel's most cherished gift is that from Drustan's family: vambraces carved with the image of the Cullach Gorym, their family emblem (their diadh-anam). Thus he is welcomed into the royal house of Alba. Imriel puts a good face on it but inside he feels nothing but sadness and a hollow feeling. It is hot, he is uncomfortable, and Sidonie is right there the whole time, watching him wed someone else. During the ceremony, Sidonie throws rose petals upon the couple. Imriel knows the true meaning of this: there is a passage in the Trois-Mille Joies that says to cover your lover in kisses is like falling flower petals. Everyone else at the wedding are happy, making Imriel's brooding and moping all the more poignant, though well-hidden. Dorelei and Imriel make love that night, as Dorelei wishes to have a child, having lit a candle to Eisheth. In the following days, Imriel confesses to Dorelei that he is in love with someone else, to which she answers that she knows, but understands that theirs is a marriage of politics. Eamonn arrives at court from Skaldia after winning the favor of his Skaldic bride Brigitta's family. Imriel tells to Eamonn of his relationship with Sidonie. The party bound for Alba make preparations for their departure when Sidonie returns from her pilgrimage to Naamah's shrine. She and Imriel meet at a temple of Naamah for a last rendezvous before his departure. The following morning, Imriel departs for Alba with a large D'Angeline escort, Drustan's family, Ph√®dre n√≥ Delaunay and Joscelin Verreuil. = The Lust Trap = After the wedding, they travel across Alba to the Prince's new home, Clunderry, with Dorelei's family using the 'open roads' (the taisgaidh), which are paths where no one is allowed to fight, be attacked or raided, and to which all Albans have access. During his first night on Alban soil, Imriel, missing Sidonie, fantasizes of her and pleasures himself, spilling his seed on the ground. Days later during his sleep he is woken by an irresistible lustful pull. He gets up and follows it. It leads him to a lone Alban woman, Morwen, who seems to have the ability to control him and wants him to have a child with her. Though he tries to refuse, the spell she has cast on him strong. Suddenly, some of the Albans from the escort interrupt them and the woman flees. The Albans tell him he was stupid indeed. By spreading his seed, filled with his lust and love, on the common soil, this woman has been given the tools to ensnared him by making a small mannekin of him, allowing her to call on him whenever she wishes. They also tell him that the two claw tattoos on her face means she is of the Maghuin Dhonn. The spell is strong and his only help is to go to an Ollamh, a religious druid-like figure. The Ollamh casts a spell that binds his desire and makes him unable to feel the lust and pain he has been fighting throughout the series. The spell requires red ribbons to be tied to his wrists and ankles. Imriel must also wear a croonie-stone around his neck to protect himself. If any of these are taken off or broken, the spell will be broken and he will be under the woman's control again. Imriel feels relieved and more clear-headed than he has been in months. There is a noticeable change in his mood. While he is still self- centered, he does not seem as sad as he was before and is able to grow to love. Dorelei, however, loses her visions of the future, saying that she feels as if a giant grey cloud were covering them from her sight. Still, Clunderry is peaceful and typical of an Alban noble's home. It is filled with people who are the salt of the earth. Though he is somewhat successful at winning over his household, many are still reserved about this new D'Angeline pretty-boy Prince. Imriel earns their respect, however, when he stages a raid on a neighbouring lord, Leodan of Briclaedh. This lord has challenged him and wants to steal his cattle and horses, perceiving Imriel to be in a position of weakness. Imriel stuns everyone by staging a preemptive raid on him before Leodan can attack Imriel. Such raids are done mainly to prove a ruler's mettle during times of peace. Imriel manages to escape from multiple attackers with no injuries, earning him praise and respect from all. This also garners him the friendship of Urist, a guard of Clunderry of good renown and well liked by the troops. On the ride back, Imriel is elated. He finally feels he is accepted and respected, not because of his birth but because he has earned it. Then he again feels the lustful pull supposedly bound within him. He is again seized by an outside force and he rides into a sheltered wooded area, where the woman is waiting. He tries to resist as much as he can, but his body responds to her regardless. The woman attempts intercourse, but they are disturbed before anything more can happen. During the encounter Imriel learns that one of his red ties has been cut off during the battle. When he arrives home he goes to the local Ollamh, who recasts the spell before he even attends the celebratory feast. Life continues in the Alban holding, and Dorelei and Imriel manage to develop a loving relationship. Dorelei is most certainly in love with Imriel, but Imriel's love is weak compared to his feelings for Sidonie. Dorelei has become pregnant and Imriel can not wait for his child. Imriel's cousin, Alais arrives at Clunderry. During her stay she grows and matures significantly. She has been learning the arts of the Ollamh and loves it. Though she does not love Talorcan, she is leaving open the possibility of love, and does not refuse him. One night, a letter arrives. Sidonie writes to Imriel telling him that, despite the distance, she is still in love with him. She tells him to stay in Alba, however, for at least the first year. Dorelei had promised him that, if Imriel was not happy after the first year, he could leave her and move back to Terre d'Ange. They could be as Drustan and Ysandre and see each other half the year, or even less. While reading this letter, Imriel is shocked at his lack of emotions. He can barely picture Sidonie's face, and all feelings for her are muted. Thus he decides to take a risk by removing the croonie-stone while he re-reads the letter. He is filled with sorrow and love. He misses her terribly and still loves her as well. After a short while and reading the letter a number of times, he returns the croonie- stone around his neck and returns to his bed with Dorelei. = Death, Change, and Magic = By spring, Dorelei is nearing the end of her pregnancy. She and Imriel are looking forward to their first child, and while love has grown between to the two, Imriel is still distracted by his love for Sidonie, though he is always caring and loving to Dorelei. Imriel also feels a commitment to being a part of his child's life. Soon after the Day of Misrule, however, Morwen appears out of the woods right in front of Clunderry's men. She remains on the taisgaidh roads, but demands to see Imriel. Imriel meets her with all of his guards, the Ollamh, Alais, and Dorelei who insisted on coming along. Morwen says she is willing to make a deal with Imriel: if he will come with her to the circle of standing stones and let her show him the future, she will give him his mannekin thereby freeing him of her magic. The circle is not far away and is on taisgaidh lands. Imriel does not trust her but she says that if he wants to bring his troops he may, so long as they stay outside of the circle. Imriel then asks the advice of the Ollamh. She does not trust Morwen as well and advises that before the ceremony and in the stone circle, Morwen should swear not to harm Imriel or any of his family. Morwen agrees without hesitation and with none of the tell-tales of a lie. Imriel says he will take the day to decide and give her his decision at sunset. Morwen agrees and leaves as though she had melted into the woods themselves. Imriel and Dorelei discuss the proposal and come to a decision. Imriel will take a large escort of the troops to the circle with him and be careful. Dorelei will not risk herself or the child by coming with him and will stay in Clunderry with the remaining guards. While it is dangerous, the reward would be Imriel's freedom, restoration of Dorelei's visions, and security for their unborn child. They deem the risk is worth the reward. They also finally decide on the name of the child: Aniel if it is a boy and Anielle if it is a girl. That evening, Dorelei helps Imriel put on his vambraces and prepare for his meeting with Morwen. At the edge of taisgaidh roads, Morwen waits. Upon Imriel's agreement, she leads them to the standing stones. Night has fallen, and though there are many of Imriel's men carrying torches, the circle still has an eerie look about it. Morwen tells him that he can not wear any metal within the circle and that the lights must be put out. He asks why and she only replies that that is how the spell works. To verify his safety, he asks her to make the pledge with the Ollamh first. Morwen and the Ollamh go into the circle. Morwen swears: ::\\"No harm will befall Imriel de la Courcel of Clunderry this night, nor any member of his household, nor any person dear to him. I swear it by the stone and sea and sky, by all the gods of Alba, and by the diadh-anam of the Maghuin Dhonn. If I lie, let my magic be broken and my life be forfeit. Let every man and woman's hand be raised against me, let my name be gall on their lips. Let the gods and the diadh-anam forsake me, and let the land itself despise my footfall. Let my spirit wander for ten thousand years without solace.\\" The Ollamh is satisfied and departs for the outside of the circle. Morwen leads Imriel into the circle, after telling him to take off his shoes. She seemingly lifts one of the standing stones and takes out her things from under it, letting it fall back down behind her. On the stone table, she places her things and takes some tea, which she drinks first before giving it to Imriel. He asks her what it is. She says it is mushroom tea and a gift of the earth. She then paints her eyelids and his. Picking up the stone knife and a leather bag she passes the bag to him. He feels the mannekin inside it. Morwen then suddenly cuts his bindings and all his love, lusts, and emotions come flooding back. Morwen then cuts her wrists and holds his hands. Waiting, the tea starts to have an effect. Eventually, he begins to see that the stones are telling him a story. He sees a boy who is obviously his unborn son, Aniel. He sees Dorelei dead with Aniel holding on to him. He sees his son with Alais and then, as a teen, yelling at Urist. Then there is a pause. Morwen says this is because he has left Alban shores. He returns, however, and Imriel can see the glitter of intelligence in his eyes and glee at the causing of arguments. These arguments lead to wars between the tribes of Alba and the death of Talorcan. He is then named Cruarch and brings hundreds of D'Angeline soldiers to Alba, crushing all resistance. He sees women and children taken out of their homes and their homes being torched. He sees Aniel kill a wounded man begging for mercy. Aniel burns the sacred groves and drags away the standing stones. He is a fearless and cruel leader who hunts down the Maghuin Dhonn until all are gone, and redesigns Bryn Gorrydum into a D'Angeline city. Finally, Imriel begs her to stop and she does, letting go of his hands. \\"Your son is a monster, Imriel,\\" she says. Imriel asks why this is. She replies that she does not know, and at first the visions were of many possibilities. Dorelei would die before her second child is born and Imriel leaves Alban shores. At first, there was Imriel and Morwen's daughter to balance Aniel, but now all that remained was this one vision. Imriel asks if she considered that her intervention caused this in the first place, and whether she considered not getting involved. With deep sorrow, she said she had considered it. Imriel hears horns and sees the flaws in Morwen. Realizing the cuts were deeper than he thought he learns an awful secret. Morwen has lied, harm is coming to Imriel's family. Her life is sacrificed for the good of the Maghuin Dhonn. Imriel and his guards rush back to Clunderry, still under the effects of the mushroom tea. All is in a daze and blurry. The gates of the castle are open; Leodan of Briclaedh staged his counter cattle-raid on this night after hearing that the troops would be elsewhere. A giant bear is now trying to exit the castle. Imriel charges him, but is wounded by its paw and falls unconscious. When he wakes, he sees Dorelei lying on a table nearby, clearly dead. Imriel falls into a deep depression. He has been severely injured by the bear, who is really the Maghuin Dhonn leader Berlik. He is transported to Bryn Gorrydum and being treated by an Eisandine healer. Alais would keep him company most days, but vengeance was what kept him alive; he wanted Berlik's death. The hunt for Berlik in Alba was unsuccessful, but Hyacinthe, the Master of the Straits, saw a large bear swim to Azzalle, across the straits. While he could not be sure it was Berlik, Imriel was. Imriel swears he will bring back Berlik's head and bury it at Dorelei's feet, a traditional custom in Alba. Urist promises to help him, as do a number of Clunderry's men. = The Long Hunt for Berlik = When Imriel is finally deemed to be well enough to ride, he tells Drustan of the arrangements, says goodbye to Alais, and departs for Terre d'Ange. In Azzalle, Urist and Imriel destroy the mannekin and cut his bindings. Imriel tells him who it was he loved all this time and, while shocked, Urist still dedicates himself to Imriel's service: \\"So you were good enough for the Cullach Gorrym, good enough to marry Dorelei mab Beidaia, good enough to beget Alba a successor, but not good enough for the Queen's daughter?\\" They all ride for the City of Elua, dedicated to true love and the hunt for Berlik. Upon arriving at the Palace, Imriel immediately goes to Sidonie's quarters, sinks to his knees before her and wraps his arms around her waist. Ysandre walks in on the scene and is furious. Imriel walks out from the Palace, but not before Sidonie kisses him before the all those watching. Mavros offers the Shahrizai hunting estates outside of the City for Imriel and the Albans to stay out of the turmoil of the City. Sidonie comes to see him. After lovemaking, a royal escort led by Lord Amaury Trente come to take her back home. She refuses, saying she is a grown woman now over the age of majority, and that she will love who she loves freely. Imriel learns that Ph√®dre and Joscelin still are not back from their mysterious journey, but he visits the house and has a pleasant visit with all. Upon gathering all the supplies and funding he needs, including from the royal coffers despite Ysandre's opinion of his affair with her daughter, he and the Albans depart for the north. Their journey takes them through the Flatlands toward the new kingdom of Vralia. Imriel and Urist then book passage by boat to the capital of Vralia, following Berlik's trail. After being lost on an island for at least a month, they both make it to the capital Vralgrad. Urist is too injured to continue, however, and stays in Vralgrad. Imriel continues to follow rumours of Berlik south to the small town of Tarkov. Imriel has the unfortunate bad timing, however, to be in Tarkov for a Tartar raid. Seeing the scars on his behind left from Dar≈°anga, the people think that he is a secret spy of the Tartars and put him in jail. He is stuck there for a long time with one other Tartar prisoner. He manages to escape through cunning, and helps free his Tartar companion so that he may be able to go back to the woman he loves. From there Imriel follows the long-stale path of Berlik, or what he thinks is Berlik's path. He stops at a small Yeshuite Temple in Miroslas, the last reaches of civilization, and learns that Berlik stayed there for a time, seeking forgiveness. They try to discourage him from hunting down Berlik, but Imriel departs, still dedicated to his quest. He spends many days and nights wandering the untamed forests in search of Berlik. He goes nearly mad with the silence, loneliness, and seemingly hopelessness of his mission. He is forced to send back his horse, hoping it will make it alive to a warm stable, for lack of sufficient food and fodder. Just before deciding that he must turn back before he starves, Berlik leaves him a sign. Following this trail he comes upon a small cabin that Berlik has built and obviously still lives in. There is a makeshift cross in his cabin and a fire still burning. Here, finally, Berlik appears. He is humbled and broken and asks only for his death, for only his death at the hands of Imriel can bring him atonement. Berlik tells him, \\"I prayed...I left a trail for you to follow, and I prayed that if you found me, the diadh-anam would accept my sacrifice as atonement, and not punish all of her people for my failure. When my magic returned to me, here in the woods, I knew it was so.\\" Imriel asks why Berlik made it so hard for him. He replies, \\"Would you have come here with a humble heart if I had not?\\" Berlik admits his mistakes, his fears, and admits that he should have trusted his gods more instead of only himself. He apologizes to Imriel and calls him \\"my avenging angel.\\" As Imriel raises his sword, he knows the true meaning that Kushiel, the punisher of god, loved his charges too well. Imriel says, \\"I'm sorry,\\" cuts off Berlik's head cleanly, and weeps. After a day in Berlik's cabin, gathering more food and supplies, he departs back for his far-away home. After days of trudging, he is shocked to hear voices arguing in Rus and D'Angeline! They are not rescuers, however: they are soldiers from Tarkov, come to capture him. The D'Angeline they are arguing with is Maslin of Lombelon, sent by Sidonie to find Imriel. Maslin and Imriel manage to fight off the guards and make a truce of their once jealousy of each other. Maslin, it seems, has grown much in his travels as well. During their trek through the forests, Maslin ends up boiling Berlik's head for Imriel, in a sort of penance. It is disgusting work, but Maslin refuses to let Imriel do it. They then continue on their travels. They travel together back to Tarkov. They try to disguise Imriel but Tarkov is the closest port for ferries headed to the city and eventually home. When they arrive in Tarkov, however, they find Ph√®dre and Joscelin, come to search for Imriel and join him on his long trek. Ph√®dre is arguing with the guards, trying to explain he is a royal Prince of Terre d'Ange and not a Tartar. While they do not believe her, none want to challenge them and grudgingly \\"allow\\" them to leave. In the capital, Joscelin meets his once pupil and now leader of the Yeshuites and most trusted advisor of King Vral, Micah ben Ximon. As the weather improves, they take a boat back to the Flatlands and travel to Azzalle. Maslin chooses to stay in Vralia as a representative of Terre d'Ange, and because he has fallen in love with a local woman. Once they are back in Terre d'Ange, all are happy to report their arrival. = Truly Home = (this material is obtained from the preview at the end of the paper-back edition of Kushiel's Justice) Imriel hurries back to Sidonie's side. The Queen has calmed down considerably but cannot countenance the relationship because of Imriel's parents. She cannot denounce it, however, because to do so would be to go against Elua's Precept. He, Sidonie, Ph√®dre, Joscelin, and his Alban escort return to Clunderry to bury Berlik's head, fulfilling Imriel's promise. On their return to the City of Elua, they are greeted by a large group of people with black armbands, the victims of Melisande and Benedicte's machinations, showing a thumbs-down (see Kushiel's Mercy).

Air knives are normally used in manufacturing or as the first step in a recursive recycling process to separate lighter or smaller particles from other components for use in later or subsequent steps, post manufacturing parts drying and conveyor cleaning, part of component cleaning. The knife consists of a high-intensity, uniform sheet of laminar airflow sometimes known as streamline flow. An industrial air knife is a pressurized air plenum containing a series of holes or continuous slots through which pressurized air exits in a laminar flow pattern. The exit air velocity then creates an impact air velocity onto the surface of whatever object the air is directed. This impact air velocity can range from a gentle breeze to greater than Mach 0.6 (40,000 ft/min) to alter the surface of a product without mechanical contact. Air knives remove liquids, control the thickness of liquids, dry the liquid coatings, remove foreign particles, cool product surfaces or create a hold down force to assist in the mechanical bonding of materials to the surface. Electrical currents from anti-static bars can also be injected into the exit air knife stream to neutralize the static electricity charge on some surfaces. In the majority of manufacturing applications for air knives, the air knives are stationary while the product passes through the air velocity air stream. In other circumstances, the product is stationary and the air knives move (reciprocate or rotate) over the surface of the stationary product. Although there are very few applications where an air knife can actually cut a product (break mechanical bonds between two points), air knives are often the most efficient method of removing or controlling unwanted or foreign substances on any surface. History In the 1950s and 60s, the term \\"air doctor\\" was first used to refer to the non- contact method of debris blow-off using compressed air. The printing and textile industries were some of the largest users of air doctors at that time. They often needed wide paths of air from a compressed air system to control the thickness of liquids on a surface, or to blow debris off the surface of materials prior to the next process. Other terms used were air bar, air squeegee, air curtain, air jet, air blast, air blow off, air nozzle, air comb, air blade and air doctor blade. Today the most commonly used term is simply \\"air knife\\". Although air knives powered by compressed plant air are used in a wide variety of industrial applications, industrial blower-powered air knives have proven to reduce the energy usage versus compressed air knives by 50‚Äì75% for most applications. Blower-powered air knife systems came of age with the advent of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which started the clock on the worldwide phase-out of atmospheric ozone depleting CFC‚Äôs (chlorofluorocarbons) then used as cleaning agents in many industries. Most of these solvent-based cleaning agents simply evaporated which required no blow-off or other drying methods. Although the printed circuit board industry was still in its infancy, it was among the first to initiate the conversion to aqueous and semi-aqueous-based parts cleaning systems. With nearly every existing and all future circuit board factories using the new environmentally friendly cleaning technology, they also needed a new method of drying the p.c. boards following their water- based cleaning to remove solder fluxes and other contaminants. The trend away from other types of solvent-based parts cleaning to water-based cleaning for other industries began soon thereafter. Additionally, the conversion to water- based inks, paints, coatings, adhesives and other solutions used in various manufacturing sectors has resulted in the need for air knife dryers where none had previously existed. As a result of the Montreal Protocol and worldwide industry compliance with environmental stewardship mandates, the former niche business of air knives became an industry. Description of operation Air knives on a production line commonly range from in length with a discharge air slot or holes ranging from . A stationary air knife configuration can require from one to a dozen air knives depending on the application criteria. Air is blasted through the air knife slots via an air generator, either an industrial blower or air compressor, to deliver the predetermined exit air volume and velocity needed. There are many application, environmental, efficiency and duty cycle aspects to consider when choosing between compressors and blowers. Compressed air, which is least efficient when used for air knives discharging into free air, allows for use of primary plant air. The piping sizes supplying the air knives can be as little as diameter, so they are ideal for confined spaces. Blower-powered air knives must be larger in size along with larger diameter supply piping, but the efficiency improvement over compressed air is easily justified with the electrical power cost savings. Air knife designs today have evolved to where some manufacturers produce a very efficient ‚Äúteardrop‚Äù shape with a .95 coefficient of discharge. These blower-powered air knife designs typically have a profile of approximately wide x tall x any length, but the teardrop profile can range from tall depending on the criteria of the product for which the impact air velocity must be engineered. With construction ranging from thick aluminum extrusion to 11 gauge fabricated stainless steel, air knives can weigh 1 lb/ft to 25 lbs/ft. Depending on the width and speed of the product, the air knife can provide effective blow-off performance from or more away from the surface of the product. Round air nozzles of diameter can be effective against surfaces which are up to several feet (1 to 2 meters) from the product surface when engineered for such applications. Types and applications The most common use of air knives is to contain or remove free-standing materials (liquids or solids) from the surface of material. The applications include drying bottles and cans after filling and rinsing, printed circuit boards following the conveyorized wash to remove solder paste and flux, metals castings after automatic machining and many more. They can also deliver heated or cooled air to a surface, or create an invisible air barrier to separate heated or cooled environments from one another in industrial applications such as continuous metal heat treating ovens, cold process or storage areas in food processing or dust containment for the entrance to clean rooms. There is a variety of uses for air knives in many different industries, applications and environments. The invisible-high velocity air streams can be discharged by air knife designs of numerous shapes and sizes. These range from ‚Äúgarage built‚Äù devices with a low level of precision to the most exotic metals of construction used in air knives for class 100 clean rooms. In instances where noise reduction and moisture containment around a conveyorized air knife installation becomes important, some manufacturing facilities have installed air knives within an enclosure. These enclosures keep water contained, reduce the amount of air knife noise and even eliminate any liquid that could create safety concerns. Basic design features =Compressed air-powered air knives= There has always been a wide assortment of blow-off appliances. Air knives and nozzles for compressed air blow-off range from home made round pipes with holes to engineered high pressure air knives. In order to achieve the highest efficiency using compressed air, many manufacturers of compressed air knives utilize the CoandƒÉ effect to improve compressed air knife design over other types of knives and nozzles. Although the efficiency of compressed air for low-pressure blow-off air is much lower than blowers, the Coanda-inspired air knives entrain ambient air into the high-velocity stream to enhance the blow off effect. =Blower-powered air knives= The teardrop-shaped air knife has a bulbous plenum which tapers down to a precise air discharge slot as the standard of the blower driven air knife industry. Whereas a round pipe with holes drilled has an average coefficient of discharge of 0.6 (60% efficient), the teardrop-shaped air knife is commonly 0.95 (95% efficient), which provides much higher-impact air velocity to the surface at which the air is directed with the lowest blower motor power demand. These teardrop designs are available in extruded aluminum shapes as well as fabricated carbon and stainless steels. =OSHA compliance= Information is needed regarding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and their standards and directives on Compressed Air, especially when used for cleaning.

The Te Arawa confederation of MƒÅori iwi and hap≈´ based in the Rotorua and Bay of Plenty areas trace their ancestry from the people of this canoe. Background Te Arawa's ancestors on board the Arawa were of the NgƒÅti Ohomairangi of Ra'iƒÅtea Island. Partially owing to a battle that broke out between them and Uenuku, in which their own Whakat≈´ria fell in battle, Tamatekapua promised to captain the voyage to the islands of New Zealand, which had already been discovered by NgƒÅhue of the TƒÅwhirirangi canoe. Construction of the canoe A large tree was felled and from this the waka which came to be known as Arawa was formed. The men who turned this log into a beautifully decorated canoe were Rata, Wahieroa, NgƒÅhue and Parata. \\"Hauhau-te-rangi\\" and \\"Tuutauru\\" (made from New Zealand greenstone brought back by NgƒÅhue) were the adzes they used for this time-consuming and intensive work.Stafford, 1967, p. 5) Upon completion, the waka was given the name NgƒÅ rƒÅkau kotahi puu a Atua Matua (also known as NgƒÅ rƒÅkau maatahi puu a Atua Matua, or more simply NgƒÅ rƒÅkau rua a Atuamatua - the two trunks of Atuamatua) in memory of Tamatekapua's grandfather Atuamatua. The waka was completed and berthed in Whenuakura Bay while Tamatekapua, in his capacity as chief of the canoe, set about trying to find a priest for the journey. NgƒÅtoroirangi and his wife Kearoa were tricked by Tamatekapua to board the canoe to perform the necessary appeasement incantations to the gods prior to the canoe's departure. However, while they were on board, Tamatekapua signalled his men to quickly set sail, and before NgƒÅtoroirangi and his wife could respond they were far out to sea.Stafford, 1967, p. 14 Voyage to Aotearoa One of the more dramatic stories pertaining to the voyage to New Zealand occurred because Tamatekapua became desirous of Kearoa. NgƒÅtoroirangi noticed the glint in Tamatekapua's eye and took precautions to protect his wife during the night while he was on deck navigating by the stars. This was done by tying one end of a cord to her hair and holding the other end in his hand. However, Tamatekapua untied the cord from Kearoa's hair and attached it to the bed instead. He then made love to her, following this pattern over a number of nights. One night however, he was nearly discovered in the act by NgƒÅtoroirangi, but just managed to escape. In his haste he forgot the cord. NgƒÅtoroirangi noticed this and therefore knew that Tamatekapua had been with Kearoa. He was furious and, in his desire to gain revenge, raised a huge whirlpool in the sea named Te korokoro-o-te-Parata (\\"The throat of Te Parata\\"). The waka was about to be lost with all on board but NgƒÅtoroirangi eventually took pity and caused the seas to become calm (Steedman, pp 99-100). One incident that occurred during this drama was that all the k≈´mara carried on board the canoe were lost overboard, save for a few that were in a small kete being clutched by Whakaotirangi.Stafford, 1967, p. 15 Immediately after the calming of the seas, a shark (known as an arawa) was seen in the water. NgƒÅtoro-i-rangi immediately renamed the waka Te Arawa, after this shark, which then accompanied the waka to Aotearoa, acting in the capacity of a kai-tiaki (guardian). The Arawa canoe then continued on to New Zealand without incident, finally sighting land at Whangaparaoa where feather headdresses were foolishly cast away due to greed and due to the beauty of the pohutukawa bloom. Upon landfall, an argument took place with members of the Tainui canoe over a beached whale and the ownership thereof. Tamatekapua again resorted to trickery and took possession of it despite rightful claim of the Tainui. The canoe then travelled north up the coast to the Coromandel Peninsula, where Tamatekapua first sighted the mountain Moehau, a place he was later to make home. Heading south again, it finally came to rest at Maketu, where it was beached and stood until being burnt by Raumati of Taranaki some years later.Stafford, 1967, pp 17‚Äì18, 47) Some items of note that were brought to New Zealand on the Arawa, other than the precious k≈´mara saved by Whakaotirangi, was a tapu k≈çhatu (stone) left by NgƒÅtoroirangi on the island Te Poito o te Kupenga a Taramainuku just off the coast of Cape Colville. This stone held the mauri to protect the Arawa peoples and their descendants from evil times (Stafford, 1967, p17). In addition, the canoe brought over two gods, one called Itupaoa, which was represented by a roll of tapa, and another stone carving now possibly buried at Mokoia Island, Lake Rotorua.Stafford, 1967, pp 11‚Äì12 See also *List of MƒÅori waka References *Best, E.

Saint Vicente Liem de la Paz (Vietnamese: Vinh S∆°n Ph·∫°m Hi·∫øu Li√™m) (1732 ‚Äì November 7, 1773) was a Tonkinese (present day northern Vietnam) Dominican friar venerated as a saint and martyr by the Catholic Church. He was born Ph·∫°m Hi·∫øu Li√™m at Tr√† L≈© village, in the ph·ªß of Thi√™n Tr∆∞·ªùng, Nam ƒê·ªãnh Province, Tonkin in 1732 to Christian parents, Antonio and Monica Daeon de la Cruz, members of the Tonkinese nobility. When he fell gravely ill several days after his birth, he was baptized by Fr. Chien de Santo Tomas, taking the name of Vicente Liem. Since Tr√† L≈© was one of those Tonkinese villages where Dominican friars preached the Catholic faith, Li√™m grew up to be a Christian. He was later brought by his parents to a missionary center where he learned catechism. In 1738, King Philip V of Spain opened the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in the Philippines to Chinese and Tonkinese students, since China and Tonkin did not have Christian educational institutions. The Dominican fathers decided to let Li√™m and four other Tonkinese (Jose de Santo Tomas, Juan de Santo Domingo, Pedro Martir and Pedro de San Jacinto) study in the Philippines. Vicente took the trivium and the quadrivium in Colegio de San Juan de Letran, now the equivalent of elementary and secondary education. He finished a degree of lector of humanities at Letran. He continued his collegiate education at the University of Santo Tomas while residing at Letran. In September 1753, after completing his studies at Letran, he entered the Dominican order, along with his three Tonkinese companions. A year later, they made their solemn professions. On January 28, 1755, he received the tonsure and minor orders at the Church of Sta. Ana. In 1758 Li√™m was ordained priest under the Dominican order. On September of that year, he passed the examinations to hear confessions. On October 3, he started his journey back to Tonkin. He arrived on January 20, 1759. He spent time at Tonkin on evangelizing the Tonkinese people. However the Tonkinese authorities did not agree with this. On October 2, 1773, he and his two assistants were arrested at \\"Co Dou\\". He and his assistants were beaten up, after which they traveled on foot to the village of recorded as \\"Dou Hoi.\\" There he met another Dominican priest, the Spaniard Jacinto Casta√±eda.Butler's Lives of the Saints: February - Alban Butler, Paul Burns - 1998 Page 23- \\"In 1773 two more Dominicans, Jacinto Castaneda and Vincent Liem, lost their lives. Castaneda, a Spaniard, had served for several years as a missionary in the Philippines and in China before being deported to Vietnam, where he spent three ...\\" They were presented to the Vice Governor and to the Royal Minister. They were thrown to a cage for a night. The arrival of a High Minister prompted their transfer to Kien Nam, where the King held his court. While under detention, they still managed to preach Catholicism to the people. Later they were taken to Tan Cau, then to the house of Canh Thuy. Finally they were brought to the King where they were tried. Their trial led for the King to be angry and they were thrown to jail. After several days, the King brought down the guilty verdict with the penalty of beheading. The execution occurred on November 7, 1773. After the execution, the Christians who were present at the site carried away the bodies of de la Paz and Casta√±eda, where they were laid to rest at the town of Trung Linh in Xuan Truong, Nam ƒê·ªãnh. Several more Christian missionaries were put to death by the Tonkinese authorities. The process of beatification of de la Paz and Caste√±eda, as well as other Dominican martyrs, was initiated through Vicar Apostolic Bishop Ignacio Delgado, O.P. They were beatified by Pope Pius X with his feast day on November 6. Pope John Paul II announced the canonization of de la Paz on June 19, 1988, with his feast day on November 24.

Some of Wells' more notable clients include Michael Espy, Senator Robert Torricelli, and Congressman Floyd Flake.The New York Times, November 5, 2005. He represented former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer against allegations stemming from his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring.The New York Times, March 14, 2008. In 2008 Wells won a $364.2 million verdict for Citigroup in a trial against Parmalat. Parmalat had been asking for $2 billion in damages. The jury found that Citi was not liable, and gave Citi the highest verdict award permissible. Wells also has represented several major corporations during class action lawsuits including Merck, Philip Morris, and Johnson and Johnson. In November 2013, the National Football League hired Wells to prepare a report on a bullying incident with the Miami Dolphins involving Richie Incognito. The report, released on February 14, 2014, made headlines for its finding of \\"a pattern of harassment\\". Wells also served as the national Treasurer to Democrat Bill Bradley's presidential campaign. In 2015, Ted Wells was again hired by the NFL, this time to investigate the New England Patriots' alleged \\"Deflategate\\" infractions. His report concluded that it was \\"more probable than not\\" that Tom Brady was \\"generally aware\\" of tampering with NFL game footballs during the 2015 AFC Championship Game. Ted Wells's independence and impartiality has been called into question in the wake of the report because of his extensive prior business relations with the NFL, his use of a scientific consultancy with a reputation for questionable client-serving results, and because of his track-record of success exculpating high-profile clients and corporations during public scandals. Eventually, Judge Richard Berman overturned Tom Brady's suspension in the Deflategate saga that had been based on Wells's report; however the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it in 2016.

Current members include Jim Santo, Aisha Cohen, Michelle Caputo, James Pertusi, and Andrea Dovalle. Career The band originated in the late 1990s as a recording project of Serpa and drummer Steve Gonzalez. The band's name was taken from the title of an unreleased demo tape, Here Come The Sharp Things, which in turn was taken from a lyric to a never-recorded song, the title of which is now forgotten. Guitarist Santo (formerly of Jenifer Convertible), joined in 1997 and the trio adopted The Sharp Things as its name for performances at small clubs on the Lower East Side of New York City. The Sharp Things steadily added members over the next few years and began to broaden its musical palette with strings, horns, woodwinds, keyboards and other instruments. The group's first album, Here Comes The Sharp Things (an entirely different set of songs from the similarly entitled demo tape) was released in the United States in 2002 on Dive Records. Comprising songs recorded by two different ensembles in 2000 and 2001, and largely produced by Serpa and Santo in the former's basement studio in Queens, New York, Here Comes The Sharp Things won critical acclaim for its lush, melancholy blend of British folk revival, classical music, jazz and 1970s radio pop influences. Favorable comparisons were drawn to a diverse list of artists, including Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, Nick Cave, Talk Talk, The Left Banke and Randy Newman. A cassette-only release appeared in 2003 on the Italian label Best Kept Secret, followed by a release in the United Kingdom on Setanta Records in the spring of 2004. In August of that year, the song \\"Demon Of Love\\" was released by Nettwerk on Public Display of Affection: The Sound of Independent Radio, a compilation of songs chosen by program directors from four of the most influential public radio stations in the United States; The Sharp Things were picked by Rita Houston of Fordham University station WFUV. Foxes & Hounds was released in 2005 on Bar/None Records. In contrast to the lo-fi, homemade approach of the debut, the second album was entirely recorded and mixed in professional recording studios in New York City. Foxes & Hounds also marked the emergence of The Sharp Things as a relatively stable line-up, and coincided with a stepped-up schedule of performances. R&B;, blues, disco and rock influences manifested themselves in the songs on the album. The Sharp Things began recording their third album on October 14, 2006. Entitled A Moveable Feast, the album features performances by The New York Symphonic Arts Ensemble. The 40-piece orchestra, conducted by Sybille Werner, was recorded on November 9, 2006, at the Julia Richman Education Complex in Manhattan. Other performers include Tony Award-winning actor and musician Michael Cerveris; Franz Nicolay, keyboardist for The Hold Steady; and tenor saxophonist Stuart D. Bogie of Antibalas. Returning to the homemade approach of Here Comes A Sharp Things, A Moveable Feast was recorded in various kitchens, living rooms and basements around New York City by producer Billy \\"Prince Polo\\" Szeflinski. The album was mixed March 8‚Äì12, 2007, by Alex Lipsen at Headgear Recording in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. At the urging of Bar/None owner Glenn Morrow, an additional song, \\"Cruel Thing,\\" was recorded April 26‚Äì27, 2007, at Truth & Soul, also in Williamsburg. Clay Wells Holley was recording engineer, and mixed the song with Szeflinski. A Moveable Feast was released June 26, 2007 on Bar/None Records. On September 28, 2009, The Sharp Things began recording what was to become a four-album series titled Dogs Of Bushwick. Again produced by Szeflinski, the recordings were primarily done at The Kennel Recording Studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn, a facility owned by Santo that closed in April 2014. Between July 23, 2010 and September 15, 2010, the band sponsored a Kickstarter fundraising drive that received more than $3,600 in pledges to fund the album's recording. A second campaign, on Indiegogo between February 1, 2014 and April 2, 2014, again raised more than $3,600. Further recording and mixing was done at Danbro Studios in Brooklyn and at Dubway Studios in Manhattan. A free digital single, \\"It's Alright,\\" originally recorded by Black Sabbath and written and sung by drummer Bill Ward, was released in November 2012 to promote the album series. The first album in the Dogs Of Bushwick series, Green Is Good, was released on February 26, 2013, on Dive Records. The second album in the series, The Truth Is Like The Sun, was released on November 26, 2013, also on Dive. On September 26, 2013, The Sharp Things returned to the concert stage for the first time in three years, performing at Galapagos Art Space, located in the DUMBO section of Brooklyn. The performance was recorded by Jon D'Uva and released on March 20, 2014 as Live At Galapagos Art Space. On July 17, 2014, Serpa announced on the band's Facebook page that the next album in the Dogs Of Bushwick series would be titled Adventurer's Inn. According to Serpa, the album was \\"named after a long dismantled amusement park where I spent many great days when I was child.\\" The album was released December 2, 2014. A single from the album, \\"Love Me Indigo,\\" received airplay on several Triple A radio stations in the United States, including WTMD, in Towson, Maryland, which hosted a live concert broadcast of The Sharp Things in February 2015. Drummer and founding member Steve Gonzalez died September 11, 2014. He was 49. The band, which had been booked to perform that evening at Mercury Lounge in New York City, learned of his death shortly before taking the stage. The performance was recorded and distributed digitally by the New York City-based concert blogger NYC Taper. Selected Songs 2002-2014, compiled from the band's discography to date, was released by Dive Records on December 25, 2014. In 2015 the band began performing in smaller ensembles, often without a drummer. The group supported The Church on nine U.S. dates in March of that year, as a duo and quartet. In September, Serpa and Pertusi played two shows in England, opening for Caravan Of Thieves and The Polyphonic Spree; this resulted in The Sharp Things being invited to open for the Spree on five dates of their U.S. tour in November 2015. EverybodyEverybody, the fourth and final album in the Dogs Of Bushwick series, was released February 19, 2016 on Ropeadope Records.

She was a member of Onyanko Club between May 1986 and September 1987 and went on to have a successful solo career with 11 number-one hits. Biography Kudo began her singing career at the age of 14 as a member of three-piece pop unit Seventeen Club formed by runner-ups from the 1984 Miss Seventeen Contest organized by Japanese teen magazine Seventeen, which Shuesha publishes. They had two singles released by CBS/Sony Records in 1985. Their first single \\"Su Ki Futari Tomo!\\" was released on January 21, 1985 and was used in a television advertisement for snack food products \\"Suzuki Kun\\" and \\"Sato Kun\\" manufactured and sold by S&B; Foods. The second single \\"Baajin Kuraishisu (Virgin Crisis)\\" was released on August 25, 1985. Its lyrics were written by Sunplaza Nakano- kun, who was a lead singer of Japanese rock band Bakufu Slump. Kudo later said that she hated the second single and that she joined the group \\"just to have fun\\". Onyanko Club made their television debut on April 1, 1985 on Fuji TV's daily live television variety show Y≈´yake Nyan Nyan. Initially the group consisted of nine high school girls and two high school graduates, namely Sayuri Kokusho (number 8) and Satomi Fukunaga (number 11). They were selected from participants in Fuji TV's show aired in February and March that year. Kudo auditioned for the group in May 1986 during her first year in high school and became a member with number 38 assigned on May 23.. The group gave a new approach to the idol formula with 52 official members and three associate members, with several subgroups, such as Ushiroyubi Sasaregumi, Nyangilas and Ushirogami Hikaretai. After having appeared in the one-hour daily TV show from Monday to Friday regularly and having participated in Onyanko Club's fifth single \\"Osaki ni Shitsurei\\" as well as their nationwide concert tour in the summer and fall of 1986, Kudo was selected as one of two backing vocals for Onyanko Club number 36 member Marina Watanabe's first single \\"Shinkokyu- shite\\", along with Akiko Ikuina (number 40). The single was released under the name of \\"Watanabe Marina with Onyanko Club\\" by Epic/Sony Records on October 8, 1986 and debuted at number one on the Oricon's Japanese single chart (the national single chart). Kudo continued to participate in Onyanko Club's recordings, such as their fourth album Side Line, which was the first one of their albums Kudo participated in and contains few songs in which Kudo had solo vocal parts, such as \\"Dare no Sei Kana\\" and \\"Shin-Shin Kaiin Bangou no Uta\\". In the spring of 1987, Kudo was selected as one of the three members of Ushirogami Hikaretai along with Akiko Ikuina and Makiko Saito (number 42). The group's first single \\"Toki no Kawa wo Koete\\" was released by Canyon Records on May 7, 1987 and debuted at number one on the Oricon's Japanese single chart. The song and its B-side \\"Ushirogami Hikaretai\\" were used as an opening theme and ending theme, respectively, of Fuji TV's anime High School! Kimengumi. Also, Kudo was featured as one of the four main vocals for Onyanko Club's eighth single \\"Katatsumuri Samba\\" released by Canyon Records on May 21, 1987. It debuted at number one on the Japanese single chart. Ushirogami Hikaretai subsequently released four more singles, two studio albums and two videos from July 1987 to June 1988 with a live album released as their final material in July 1988 (Hora ne, Haru ga Kita - First Concert). Kudo has said of her time in Onyanko Club that \\"it was a great experience, with good, bad and really dirty things\\", and that she tried not to draw too much attention to herself over senior Onyanko Club members who were more popular than her at that time. Less than three weeks before Onyanko Club disbanded on September 20, 1987 with their two-day final concerts at Yoyogi National Gymnasium, Kudo launched her solo career with her first single \\"Kindan no Telepathy\\" released by Canyon Records on August 31. It debuted at number one on the Japanese single chart and also became a favorite throughout Asia during the early 1990s. The second and third singles, \\"Again\\" and \\"Daite-kuretara-iinoni\\", had moderate success, both reaching number three on the Oricon's Japanese single chart. Released on June 1, 1988 the fourth single \\"Fu-ji-tsu\\" reached number one on the chart. The song drew attention as its lyrics were written by famed and critically acclaimed Japanese singer-songwriter Miyuki Nakajima. The number of its sales exceeded that of each of the three previous singles. The fifth single \\"Mugon... Iroppoi\\", whose lyrics were written by Nakajima again, was used in a television advertisement for cosmetics products of Japanese company Kanebo Cosmetics, and reached number one on the chart. It was sold more than double the previous single. She eventually enjoyed a run of eight consecutive number- one singles in Japan between 1988 and 1990, eleven in total, and four number- one albums between 1988 and 1991. She continued to release new music every year until 2000 with sporadic releases since then. Her most recent release came in 2008 when she teamed up with Miyuki Nakajima, co-composer of five of Kudo's late-1980s hits, for a double A-side, \\"Night Wing\\"/\\"Yuki Gasa\\". Kudo said of their long-term working relationship that \\"We are not that close. We have a nice distance. Sometimes when I hear her music, it scares me but I especially like her passionate lyrics.\\" Kudo also appears on television in jidaigeki roles and also creates her own jewelry sold in Japan. Personal life Kudo married Takuya Kimura of popular boy-band SMAP in 2000.https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/japanese-star- takuya-kimura-shares-rare-picture-taken-with-singer-wife They have two children named Kokomi and Mitsuki.

These colleges are accredited to deliver instruction at 58 teaching locations in 33 states. In the current academic year, these colleges are educating more than 30,000 future physicians‚Äî25 percent of all U.S. medical students. Seven of the colleges are public and 29 are private institutions. AACOM serves as a unifying voice for osteopathic medical education (OME), fostering collaboration among its member institutions, and is active in advocacy at the federal government level. The Association is governed by its Board of Deans and led by President Robert A. Cain, DO AACOM often works in collaboration with other allied organizations and promotes public awareness for osteopathic medicine and OME. The association provides centralized services to its members, including data collection and analysis, and operation of its online application service, AACOMAS, for prospective students applying to U.S. osteopathic medical schools.  Mission  AACOM provides leadership for the osteopathic medical education community by promoting excellence in medical education, research and service, and by fostering innovation and quality across the continuum of osteopathic medical education to improve the health of the American public.  History  Osteopathic medicine was founded in the late 1800s in Kirksville, Missouri, by Andrew Taylor Still, MD, DO, a medical doctor who recognized that the medical practices of the day often caused more harm than good. He focused on developing a system of medical care that would promote the body‚Äôs innate ability to heal itself and called this system of medicine osteopathy, now known as osteopathic medicine. In 2012, AACOM worked with the Association of American Medical Colleges to improve medical education on post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries. Osteopathic physicians, also known as DOs, work in partnership with their patients. They consider the impact that lifestyle and community have on the health of each individual, and they work to break down barriers to good health. DOs are licensed to practice the full scope of medicine in all 50 states. They practice in all types of environments, including the military, and in all types of specialties, from family medicine to obstetrics, surgery, and aerospace medicine. Publications AACOM publishes the Student Guide to Osteopathic Medical Colleges annually and Inside OME, a biweekly e-newsletter covering news related to osteopathic medicine and OME, legislation, updates on the transition to a single graduate medical education (GME) system, and more. AACOM also publishes a number of reports throughout the year which focus on original research and data in OME.

Part One of The Philosophy of Freedom examines the basis for freedom in human thinking, gives an account of the relationship between knowledge and perception, and explores the role and reliability of thinking as a means to knowledge. In Part Two Steiner analyzes the conditions necessary for human beings to be free, and develops a moral philosophy that he describes as \\"ethical individualism\\".Chapter 9, \\"The Idea of Freedom\\". The book's subtitle, Some results of introspective observation following the methods of natural science,An alternate translation reads, \\"Results of Introspective Observations According to the Method of Natural Science\\" (Rudolf Steiner, The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, trans. Rita Stebbing (N.Y.: Rudolf Steiner Publications, 1963), p. 3). The German original is, \\"Beobachtungs-Resultate nach naturwissenshcaftlicher Methode\\" (Steiner, 1894, title page). indicates the philosophical method Steiner intends to follow. Historical context Steiner had wanted to write a philosophy of freedom since at least 1880.Christoph Lindenberg, Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie, (Stuttgart: Verlag Freies Geistesleben 1997), pp. 212‚Äì3. The appearance of The Philosophy of Freedom in 1894Rudolf Steiner, Die Philosophie der Freiheit: Grundzuege einer modernen Weltanschauung, (Berlin: Emil Felder, 1894) was preceded by his publications on Goethe, focusing on epistemology and the philosophy of science, particularly Goethe the Scientist (1883)\\"Goethe the Scientist\\" and The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception (1886).The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception, with Specific Reference to Schiller, also translated as Goethe's Theory of Knowledge, An Outline of the Epistemology of His Worldview. In 1891, Steiner presented his doctoral dissertation, an epistemological study that includes discussion of Kant's and Fichte's theories of knowledge. A revised version of the thesis was published a year later in book form as Truth and Knowledge: Introduction to a Philosophy of Freedom.,Truth and Knowledge dedicated to Eduard von Hartmann. In the Preface to The Philosophy of Freedom itself, Steiner described the aim of the book: knowledge should become \\"organically alive\\". \\"All real philosophers have been artists in the realm of concepts. For them, human ideas were their artists' materials and scientific method their artistic technique.\\"Steiner, Preface to the First Edition, 1894, revised 1918. Wilson translation 1964. While a student in Vienna, Steiner attended some of the lectures of Franz Brentano, an important precursor of the phenomenological movement in philosophy (see School of Brentano).Owen Barfield in The Case for Anthroposophy, Selections from Von Seelenr√§tseln By Rudolf Steiner, London, 1970, remarks that Steiner was an admirer and assiduous reader of Brentano ; and see Steiner's remark that as a student Brentano's stimulus strongly affected him, and in following years he read most of what Brentano published. Like the later phenomenologists, Steiner was seeking a way to solve the subject‚Äìobject problem.Welburn, Andrew, Rudolf Steiner's Philosophy and the Crisis of Contemporary Thought (2004), chapter 2. Steiner's approach to freedom was also in part inspired by Schiller's On the Aesthetic Education of Man and a response to the scientific works of Goethe, whom Steiner believed had not focused sufficiently on the role of thinking in developing inner freedom.Sergei Prokofieff, Anthroposophy and The Philosophy of Freedom, Temple Lodge Press 2009, p. 206. Steiner was also deeply affected as a young man by Kant's argument in the Critique of Pure Reason that we cannot know things as they are in themselves, and he devotes a long chapter of The Philosophy of Freedom, \\"Are there Limits to Knowledge?\\", to a refutation of this view, arguing that there are in principle no limits to knowledge. This claim is important to freedom, because for Steiner freedom involves knowing the real basis of our actions. If this basis cannot be known, then freedom is not possible. Steiner's argument in favour of freedom also responds to determinists such as Spinoza, for whom human action is just as much determined as anything else in the necessity that governs nature as a whole. Other philosophers discussed or mentioned in The Philosophy of Freedom include George Berkeley, Pierre Jean George Cabanis, Descartes, Ernst Haeckel, Robert Hamerling, von Hartmann, Hegel, David Hume, Johannes Kreyenbuehl,Ethical- Spiritual Activity in Kant, A critical-speculative study of the true spirit in Kantian philosophy, Johannes Kreyenbuehl, article referenced by Steiner published in English translation 1986, Otto Liebmann, Friedrich Paulsen, Paul R√©e, Johannes Rehmke, Schelling, Schopenhauer, Herbert Spencer, and David Strauss.Rudolf Steiner, Philosophie der Freiheit, Rudolf Steiner Verlag 1987, see Index of Names, pp. 283‚Äì284. Arrangement and outline of the book The parts of the two-fold structure of The Philosophy of Freedom resemble the structure of Hegel's description of freedom: \\"Ethical life is the Idea of freedom as the living good which has its knowledge and volition in self- consciousness, and its actuality through self-conscious action\\", but Steiner differs from Hegel in an essential way: Steiner finds the activity of thinking to be something much greater and more real than the concepts which crystallize out of thinking.:\\"My remarks concerning the self-supporting and self- determined nature of thinking cannot...be simply transferred to concepts. I make special mention of this, because it is here that I differ from Hegel, who regards the concept as something primary and original. -- end of first paragraph, Chapter 4 \\"The World as Percept, The Philosophy of Freedom Steiner seeks to demonstrate that we can achieve a true picture of reality only by uniting perception, which reflects only the outer appearance of the world, and conception, which together give us access to the world's inner nature.Chapters 5 \\"The Act of Knowing\\", 7 \\"Are there Limits to Knowledge?\\" He proposes that freedom depends upon a person bridging the gap between ideals and the constraints of external reality, so that the person's external deeds begin to be inspired by moral imagination. Knowledge of freedom Steiner begins exploring the nature of human freedom by accepting \\"that an action, of which the agent does not know why he performs it, cannot be free,\\" but asking what happens when a person becomes conscious of his or her motives for acting. He proposes (1) that through introspective observation we can become conscious of the motivations of our actions, and (2) that the sole possibility of human freedom, if it exists at all, must be sought in an awareness of the motives of our actions.Wilson, Chapter 1 \\"Conscious Human Action\\" In Chapter 2, \\"The Fundamental Desire for Knowledge,\\" Steiner discusses how an awareness of the division between mind, or subject, and world, or object, gives rise to a desire to reestablish a unity between these poles. After criticizing solutions to this problem provided by dualism in the philosophy of mind and several forms of monism as one-sided, Steiner suggests that only by locating nature's manifestations within our subjective nature can we overcome this division. In Chapter 3, \\"Thinking in the Service of Knowledge,\\" Steiner observes that when confronted with percepts, we feel obliged to think about and add concepts to these: to observation we add thinking. Steiner seeks to demonstrate that what he considers the primary antithesis between observation and thinking underlies all other related antitheses and philosophical distinctions, such as subject vs. object, appearance vs. reality, and so on. For most objects of observation, he points out, we cannot observe both the percept and our thinking about this percept simultaneously, for a tree and thinking about a tree are fundamentally different; we can only attend to one at a time. In contrast, we can simultaneously observe thinking and observe our thoughts about thinking, for here the percept (thinking) and our thinking about the percept consist of the same element (thought): Just thinking and thinking about thinking are the same process; observing the latter, we are simultaneously observing the former. Normally, however, for just that reason we do not pay attention to the process of thinking, only its results, the thoughts themselves: \\"The first observation which we make about thinking is therefore this: that it is the unobserved element in our ordinary mental and spiritual life\\".Wilson, Ch. 3 p. 26. Steiner connects this \\"first observation\\" to the fact that thinking is entirely due to our own activity. It does not appear before us unless we ourselves produce it. Nevertheless, when I apprehend the content of thinking, a concept, this is self-justifying, in the sense that it can be asked why I feel this or that way about something, but not why it produces in me this or that concept. Such a question would be \\"simply meaningless\\".Wilson, Ch.3 p. 25. Their contents justify the relations of concepts to one another. Furthermore, when observing my thinking, it is always a past instance of thinking that I observe, not a present one. That the thinker and the observer of the thinker are one and the same explains why I can know thinking \\"more intimately and immediately than any other process in the world\\"Wilson, p. 27. This is what Steiner calls the transparency of our thinking process.Wilson, p. 28. To appreciate this point, we must be able to adapt to our own thinking the \\"exceptional\\" procedure mentioned above: we must apply it to itself. If we are unable to do this, and we think of thinking as a brain-process, it is because we do not see thinking, because we are unable to take up the exceptional position needed to do so. Steiner takes Descartes' dictum, \\"I think, therefore I am,\\" to signify that \\"I am certain . . . that [thinking] exists in the sense that I myself bring it forth,\\"Wilson, p 30. Cf. Steiner's own wording, in translation: \\"My investigation touches firm ground only when I find an object which exists in a sense which I can derive from the object itself. But I am myself such an object in that I think...\\" However, Steiner advances the objection (common to many others, beginning in Descartes' own time),Cottingham, Meditations, Objections and Replies that the further claim that I am is more problematic.Descartes, it could be said, began his Meditations on First Philosophy I) with doubt about his own outer experience, Steiner with trust about his own inner experience. Steiner's full view is found in the following passage. :...thinking must never be regarded as merely a subjective activity. Thinking lies beyond subject and object. It produces these two concepts just as it produces all others. When, therefore, I, as thinking subject, refer a concept to an object, we must not regard this reference as something purely subjective. It is not the subject that makes the reference, but thinking. The subject does not think because it is a subject; rather it appears to itself as a subject because it can think. The activity exercised by thinking beings is thus not merely subjective. Rather is it something neither subjective nor objective, that transcends both these concepts. I ought never to say that my individual subject thinks, but much more that my individual subject lives by the grace of thinking. The Chapter on thinking is followed by a shorter one on perception, Chapter 4. It contains two main and very important points. Steiner points out the inconsistency of treating all our perceptions as mere subjective mental images inside the brain. If that were true, the perception of the brain itself would have to be a mere subjective mental image inside the brain! In that case the basis for our knowledge of the brain would be completely undermined. The scientific claim is made, on the basis of physiology and psychology, that our percepts are produced by a causal process within the organism and hence are subjective. This is called \\"critical idealism\\" But physiology and psychology are based on these percepts. So our knowledge of physiology and psychology is subjective. But then it cannot validate the claim that percepts are subjective. Furthermore, critical idealism leaves unaccounted for the passage from the brain process to the sensation. What are the consequences of such a view of perception for the concept of knowledge? In Chapter 5 Steiner presents his concept of knowledge. Human beings are two-sided, as they both think and also perceive. The two activities together give a complete view of the world. Knowledge is the union of what is produced in thinking, the concept, and what is produced in perceiving, the percept. Steiner argues that there can be no relationship among the objects of perception other than what is revealed in the ideal element produced by thinking, the concept. Accordingly, the relation between some perceived object and ourselves is also an ideal one. An important passage analyzes the view that we cannot experience the world itself but only subjective images somewhere inside the brain, or in the soul inside the brain. This view is based on treating the perceptual relationship between self and world as other than ideal, as naively real, just as we perceive it, as a process derived in its content from perception itself. At the end of Chapter 5 Steiner completes the view of perception begun in Chapter 4. What is the percept that perceiving produces? Steiner rejects this question. 'The question asked in this way is absurd.' For a percept is the determinate content of the perception, and its \\"what?\\" - what it is - can only refer to this content. We can become conscious of our thought processes in a way that we cannot be of our feelings, will or sense perceptions. We know that what we experience in thinking is exactly what it seems, so that appearance and reality become one. By contrast, our feelings' meaning is not directly apparent, while we only perceive the meaning of a percept after some form of conceptual framework has been brought to bear (for example, we give the right spatial meaning to the visually converging lines of railroad tracks through our understanding of perspective). Mathematics is an example of thinking in which thought itself forms the perceptions; no sense-perceptions are needed to form a basis for mathematical principles. In this sense mathematics could be said to be one discipline that studies the inner aspect of reality. Steiner proposes that the apparent dualism of experience can be overcome by discovering the inner and initially hidden unity of perception and thinking.Johannes Hemleben, Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography, Henry Goulden, 1975, , pp. 61‚Äì64 (German edition: Rudolf Steiner: mit Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten, Rowohlt, 1990, ) By observing a thinking process sufficiently intensively, perceiving and thinking can begin to unify. This is knowledge. By the same token, a clear-eyed study of what is revealed in observation can lead to appropriate concepts - thinking. Steiner argues that thinking is more pervasive in our ordinary perceiving than we often recognize. If, for example, we had not as infants learned, unconsciously, to think with our eyes and limbs, then our eyes, even if functioning perfectly in a physical sense, would see only something like what the philosopher William James referred to as a \\"blooming buzzing confusion,‚Äù or what Steiner referred to as a highly chaotic stage of the ‚Äúgiven.‚Äù\\"In logic, all theory is pure empiricism; in the science of logic there is only observation. But when we want to know something other than thinking, we can do so only with the help of thinking; this means that thinking has to approach something given and transform its chaotic relationship with the world-picture into a systematic one. This means that thinking approaches the given world-content as an organizing principle.\\"GA3 We would not perceive spatial or temporal structure or recognize distinct qualities. If that conclusion seems surprising, that is because the thinking- in-perceiving learned in childhood becomes habitual and automatic long before we attain fully consciousness, so we rarely become aware of the key role cognition plays in even the simplest perceptions. Similarly, we are unconscious of the ways we perceive our thinking. 'Our next task must be to define the concept of \\"mental picture\\" more closely', Steiner writes at the end of the Chapter 6. With this concept we arrive at the relation of knowledge to the individual, and to life, and feeling. After an interesting refutation of the subjectivity of percepts, Steiner describes a mental picture as an intuition or thought related to an individual percept. And so the mental picture is defined as an individualized concept. Experience is the \\"sum total\\" of mental pictures of the individual. But there is more to the human being's cognitive inventory than percept, concept and mental picture. There is the relation of these things to the Ego; and this is feeling. Feeling gives our personal relation to the world, and we oscillate between it and the \\"universal world process\\" given in thinking. The mental pictures we form gives our mental life an individual stamp, and relates it to our own life. Chapter 7 takes up the consequences of the view that knowledge consists of the restoration of the unity of the content of the percept and the concept. Steiner calls those who make the epistemological distinction into a permanent metaphysical one dualists. For the monist ‚ÄòThe world is given to us as a duality, and knowledge transforms it into a unity.' Working with an irresolvable distinction, the dualist is bound to assert that there are limits to knowledge: ‚Äòthe ‚Äúin itself‚Äù of a thing.‚Äô For the monist there is no in-principle limit to knowledge. For monism in Steiner‚Äôs sense there are only concepts and percepts, which, united, form the object; for the dualist there is the subject, the object, the percept, and the concept.Wilson, p. 93. Nb in the 2008 printing ‚Äúpercept‚Äù is misspelled as ‚Äúprecept‚Äù. We must not conceive of the process of perception as though it is na√Øvely real, as we do when we take perception to be a causal effect of the things as they are in themselves on us. Metaphysical realism is the view that there is an object in the world that is imperceptible as it is in itself, but is also to be conceived na√Øve realistically. It 'is a contradictory mixture of na√Øve realism and idealism. Its hypothetical [elements] are imperceptible entities endowed with the qualities of percepts‚Äô.Wilson, p. 98 For the monist, the process of perception is an ideal relation. The metaphysical realist, however, is left with the unanswerable question how the metaphysically real objects are converted into subjective percepts. Here Steiner can be read as giving his account of the structure and basis of what is today called the mind-body problem. Steiner's summary of Part I of The Philosophy of Freedom, at the start of Chapter 8 in Part II, contains the following passage: :The world comes to meet me as a multiplicity, a sum of separate details. As a human being, I am myself one of these details, an entity among other entities. We call this form of the world simply the given and‚Äîinsofar as we do not develop it through conscious activity but find it ready-made‚Äîwe call it percept. Within the world of percepts, we perceive ourselves. But if something did not emerge out of this self-percept that proved capable of linking both percepts in general and also the sum of all other percepts with the percept of our self, our self-percept would remain simply one among many. This emerging something, however, is no longer a mere percept; nor is it, like percepts, simply present. It is produced through activity and initially appears linked to what we perceive as our self, but its inner meaning reaches beyond the self. It adds conceptual determinates to individual percepts, but these conceptual determinates relate to one another and are grounded in a whole. It determines conceptually what is achieved through self-perception conceptually, just as it determines all other percepts. It places this as the subject or ‚ÄúI‚Äù over against objects. This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is thinking, and the conceptual determinates are concepts and ideas.Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path, Michael LIpson translation, Chapter 8 The reality of freedom Steiner begins the second part of the book by emphasizing the role of self-awareness in objective thinking. Here he modifies the usual description of inner and outer experience by pointing out that our feelings, for example, are given to us as naively as outer perceptions. Both of these, feelings and perceptions, tell about objects we are interested in: the one about ourselves, the other about the world. Both require the help of thinking to penetrate the reasons that they arise, to comprehend their inner message. The same is true of our will. Whereas our feelings tell how the world affects us, our will tells how we would affect the world. Neither attains to true objectivity, for both mix the world's existence and our inner life in an unclear way. Steiner emphasizes that we experience our feelings and will - and our perceptions as well ‚Äì as being more essentially part of us than our thinking; the former are more basic, more natural. He celebrates this gift of natural, direct experience, but points out that this experience is still dualistic in the sense that it only encompasses one side of the world. With regard to freedom of the will, Steiner observes that a key question is how the will to action arises in the first place. Steiner describes to begin with two sources for human action: on the one hand, the driving forces springing from our natural being, from our instincts, feelings, and thoughts insofar as these are determined by our character - and on the other hand, various kinds of external motives we may adopt, including the dictates of abstract ethical or moral codes. In this way, both nature and culture bring forces to bear on our will and soul life. Overcoming these two elements, neither of which is individualized, we can achieve genuinely individualized intuitions that speak to the particular situation at hand. By overcoming a slavish or automatic response to the dictates of both our 'lower' drives and conventional morality, and by orchestrating a meeting place of objective and subjective elements of experience, we find the freedom to choose how to think and act (Wilson Ch. 9). Freedom for Steiner does not consist in acting out everything subjective within us, but in acting out of love, thoughtfully and creatively. In this way we can love our own actions, which are unique and individual to us, rather than stemming from obedience to external moral codes or compulsive physical drives. Both of the latter constitute limitations on freedom: :Whether his unfreedom is forced on him by physical means or by moral laws, whether man is unfree because he follows his unlimited sexual desire or because he is bound by the fetters of conventional morality, is quite immaterial from a certain point of view...let us not assert that such a man can rightly call his actions his own, seeing that he is driven to them by a force other than himself.Philosophy of Freedom, p. 40 Freedom arises most clearly at the moment when a human being becomes active in pure, individualized thinking; this is, for Steiner, spiritual activity. Achieving freedom is then accomplished by learning to let an ever larger portion of one's actions be determined by such individualized thought, rather than by habit, addiction, reflex, or involuntary or unconscious motives. Steiner differentiates pure thinking into \\"moral intuition\\" (formulation of individual purposes), \\"moral imagination\\" (creative strategies for realizing these larger purposes in the concrete situation), and \\"moral technique\\" (the practical capacity to accomplish what was intended). He suggests that we only achieve free deeds when we find an ethically impelled but particularized response to the immediacy of a given situation. Such a response will always be radically individual; it cannot be predicted or prescribed.Robert McDermott, The Essential Steiner: Basic Writings of Rudolf Steiner, Harper & Row, 1984, , pp. 41‚Äì44 Steiner's ethical philosophy is neither utilitarian nor deontological. For Steiner, the highest morality exists when a person acts in the world through deeds of love realized by means of individually developed and contextually-sensitive moral imaginations, This of course raises the difficulty of the one who loves evil and acts on the basis of this love. Are his actions of \\"the highest morality\\"? This all is by way of introduction and recapitulation. Steiner then introduces the principle that we can act out of the compulsions of our natural being (reflexes, drives, desires) or out of the compulsion of ethical principles, and that neither of these leaves us free. Between them, however, is an individual insight, a partly situational ethic, that arises neither from abstract principles nor from our bodily impulses.\\"...Steiner is not implying that the circumstances are...shaping the free deed.\\"Robert A. McDermott, American Philosophy and Rudolf Steiner, 2012 A deed that arises in this way can be said to be truly free; it is also both unpredictable and wholly individual. Here Steiner articulates his fundamental maxim of social life: :Live through deeds of love, and let others live with understanding for each person's unique intentions. Here he describes a polarity of influences on human nature, stating that morality transcends both the determining factors of bodily influences and those of convention: :A moral misunderstanding, a clash, is out of the question between people who are morally free. Only one who is morally unfree, who obeys bodily instincts or conventional demands of duty, turns away from a fellow human being if the latter does not obey the same instincts and demands as himself. For Steiner, true morality, the highest good, is the universal mediated by the profoundly individual and situational; it depends upon our achieving freedom from both our inner drives and outer pressures. To achieve such free deeds, we must cultivate our moral imagination, our ability to imaginatively create ethically sound and practical solutions to new situations, in fact, to forge our own ethical principles and to transform these flexibly as needed - not in the service of our own egotistical purposes, but in the face of new demands and unique situations. This is only possible through moral intuitions, immediate experiences of spiritual realities that underlie moral judgments. Moral imagination and intuition allow us to realize our subjective impulses in objective reality, thus creating bridges between the spiritual influence of our subjectivity and the natural influence of the objective world in deeds whereby \\"that which is natural is spiritual, that which is spiritual is natural\\".Agnes Nobel, Educating through Art, , p. 103. (Originally published as Filosofens Knapp, Carlsson Bokf√∂rlag, Stockholm, 1991) Toward the end of the second part of the book, Steiner writes that \\"The unique character of the idea, by means of which I distinguish myself as 'I', makes me an individual.\\" And then, \\"An act the grounds for which lie in the ideal part of my nature is free.\\" Steiner there is using the term ideal to refer to pure ideation or pure thinking in Steiner's sense. \\"The action is therefore neither stereotyped, carried out according to set rules, nor is it performed automatically in response to an external impetus; the action is determined solely through its ideal content.\\"The Philosophy of Freedom, Ch. X, \\"the Idea of Freedom\\", trans:(1) R.F.A. Hoernle; (2) R. Stebbing What is individual in us is to be distinguished from what is generic by its ideal character. If an act proceeds out of genuine thinking, or practical reason, then it is free. Steiner concludes by pointing out that to achieve this level of freedom, we must lift ourselves out of our group-existence: out of the prejudices we receive from our family, nation, ethnic group and religion, and all that we inherit from the past that limits our creative and imaginative capacity to meet the world directly. Only when we realize our potential to be a unique individual are we free. Thus, it lies in our freedom to achieve freedom; only when we actively strive towards freedom do we have some chance of attaining it. Relation to earlier and later work Before 1900, Steiner was laying the epistemological basis of his thought. Steiner mentioned that The Philosophy of Freedom was intended to give the philosophical foundations for what had been outlined in his earlier work Truth and Science (1892).The Riddles of Philosophy: A Brief Outline of an Approach to Anthroposophy, Chapter VIII A Brief Outline of an Approach to Anthroposophy. In works written after 1900, Steiner began to explain how thinking can evolve to become an organ of perception of higher worlds of living, creative, spiritual beings. Steiner frequently referred to The Philosophy of Freedom in his later lectures and in written works.Otto Palmer, \\"A Partial Bibliography of the Works of Rudolf Steiner in Which He refers to The Philosophy of Freedom included in Rudolf Steiner on His Book the Philosophy of Freedom, Compiled by Otto Palmer (1964), Near the end of his life, he suggested that The Philosophy of Freedom would outlive all his other works.Paul Marshall Allen, in Foreword to Stebbing's 1963 translation Steiner's principal works on philosophy include: * 1886 The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception. Steiner considered this to be \\"the epistemological foundation and justification for every thing I said and published later. It speaks of the essential being of knowing activity that opens the way from the sense perceptible world into the spiritual one.\\"Preface to the 1924 edition of The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World- Conception (1886)\\"Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception\\", also translated as Goethe's Theory of Knowledge, An Outline of the Epistemology of His Worldview. Online translation into English by William Lindeman see * 1892 Truth and Science (or Truth and Knowledge), dedicated to Eduard von Hartmann. * 1894 The Philosophy of Freedom. This presented the philosophical foundations for what had been outlined in Truth and Science, and its line of thought led to the same goal as Steiner's later book Theosophy: An Introduction to the Supersensible Knowledge of the World and the Destination of Man (1904).Theosophy, from the Prefaces to the First, Second, and Third Editions It contained, he claimed, the entire content, in a philosophical form, of what he later developed explicitly as anthroposophy.Sergei Prokofieff, May Human Beings Hear It!, Temple Lodge, 2004. p. 460 * 1914 A Brief Outline of an Approach to Anthroposophy, chapter 8 in the book The Riddles of Philosophy Presented in an Outline of Its History. Editorial history The first edition of Die Philosophie der Freiheit was published in 1893/4. A second revised edition appeared in 1918. Further German editions reprinted the 1918 text until 1973, when a revised edition was produced based on Steiner's corrections of the galley proofs of the 1918 edition. Minor changes, including corrections to some of Steiner's citations, were made in the 1987 German edition.Rudolf Steiner Archive publication history The first edition included the following passage Steiner removed from later editions: ‚ÄúWe no longer believe that there is a norm to which we must all strive to conform. Nothing is accepted as valid, unless it springs from the roots of individuality. The saying Each one of us must choose his hero in whose footsteps he toils up to Olympus no longer holds for us. If only we probe deep enough into the very heart of our being, there dwells something noble, something worthy of development.‚Äù In the appendix added to the 1918 edition, Steiner stated emphatically that the monism \\"of thought\\" proposed in his book was quite different from what Eduard von Hartmann and others called \\"epistemological\\" monism.Appendix added to 1918 edition English translations English translations include: *1916: The Philosophy of Freedom: A Modern Philosophy of Life Developed by Scientific Methods. trans.

There are three main types: open fetal surgery, which involves completely opening the uterus to operate on the fetus; minimally invasive fetoscopic surgery, which uses small incisions and is guided by fetoscopy and sonography; and percutaneous fetal therapy, which involves placing a catheter under continuous ultrasound guidance. Fetal intervention is relatively new. Advancing technologies allow earlier and more accurate diagnosis of diseases and congenital problems in a fetus. Fetal surgery draws principally from the fields of surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics- especially the subspecialties of neonatology (care of newborns, especially high-risk ones), maternal-fetal medicine (care of high-risk pregnancies), and pediatric surgery. It often involves training in obstetrics, pediatrics, and mastery of both invasive and non-invasive surgery, meaning it takes several years of residency, and at least one fellowship (usually more than one year), to be able to become proficient. It is possible in the U.S. to become trained in this approach whether one started in obstetrics, pediatrics, or surgery. Because of the very high risk and high complexity of these cases, they are usually performed at Level I trauma centers in large cities at academic medical centers,- offering the full spectrum of maternal and newborn care, including a high level neonatal intensive care unit (level IV is the highest) and suitable operating theaters and equipment, and a high number of surgeons and physicians, nurse specialists, therapists, and a social work and counseling team. The cases can be referred from multiple levels of hospitals from many miles, sometimes across state and provincial lines. In continents other than North America and Europe, these centers are not as numerous, though the techniques are spreading. Most problems do not require or are not treatable through fetal intervention. The exceptions are anatomical problems for which correction in utero is feasible and may be of significant benefit in the future development and survival of the fetus. Early correction (prior to birth) of these problems will likely increase the odds of a healthy and relatively normal baby. The pregnant woman bears as much, if not more, risk as her fetus during any form of fetal intervention. Besides the general risk that any surgery bears, there is also a risk to the health of the mother's uterus, potentially limiting her ability to bear more children. The risk is higher than from an elective Cesarean section because: *the incision typically will be a classical vertical one, with a greater risk of complications in subsequent pregnancies *the longer duration of the surgery, while the fetal intervention is performed *delivery of the baby will require a second Cesarean section days or weeks later Types =Open fetal surgery= Technique Tocolytics are generally given to prevent labor; however, these should not be given if the risk is higher for the fetus inside the womb than if delivered, such as may be the case in intrauterine infection, unexplained vaginal bleeding and fetal distress. An H2 antagonist is usually given for anaesthesia the evening before and the morning of the operation, and an antacid is usually given before induction to reduce the risk of acid aspiration. Rapid sequence induction is often used for sedation and intubation. Open fetal surgery is similar in many respects to a normal cesarean section performed under general anesthesia, except that the fetus remains dependent on the placenta and is returned to the uterus. A hysterotomy is performed on the pregnant woman, and once the uterus is open and the fetus is exposed, the fetal surgery begins. Typically, this surgery consists of an interim procedure intended to allow the fetus to remain in utero until it has matured enough to survive delivery and neonatal surgical procedures. Upon completion of the fetal surgery, the fetus is put back inside the uterus and the uterus and abdominal wall are closed up. Before the last stitch is made in the uterine wall, the amniotic fluid is replaced. The mother remains in the hospital for 3‚Äì7 days for monitoring. Often babies who have been operated on in this manner are born pre-term. Safety and complications The main priority is maternal safety, and, secondary, avoiding preterm labor and achieving the aims of the surgery. In 2008, open fetal surgery was considered a possibility after approximately 18 weeks of gestation due to fetal size and fragility before that, and up to approximately 30 weeks of gestation due to increased risk of premature labor and, practically, the preference for delivering the child and performing the surgery in ex utero/pediatric surgery, instead. The risk of premature labor is increased by concomitant risk factors such as multiple gestation, a history of maternal smoking, and very young or old maternal age. Open fetal surgery has proven to be reasonably safe for the mother. For the fetus, safety and effectiveness are variable, and depend on the specific procedure, the reasons for the procedure, and the gestational age and condition of the fetus. The overall perinatal mortality after open surgery has been estimated to be approximately 6%, according to a study in the United States 2003. All future pregnancies for the mother require cesarean delivery because of the hysterotomy. However, there is no presented data suggesting decreased fertility for the mother. Indications Neural tube defects(NTD), which begin to become observable at the 28th day of pregnancy, occur when the embryonic neural tube fails to close properly, the developing brain and spinal cord are openly exposed to amniotic fluid and with this, causes the nervous system tissue to break down. Prenatal repair of the most easily treated NTD, myelomeningocele (spina bifida cystica) is as of 2011, a growing option in the United States. Although the procedure is technically challenging, children treated with open fetal repair have significantly improved outcomes compared to children whose defects are repaired shortly after birth. Specifically, fetal repair reduces the rate of ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence and Chiari malformation, while improving motor skills at 30 months of age compared to post-natal repair. Children having fetal repair are twice as likely to walk independently at 30 months of age than children undergoing post-natal repair. As a result, open fetal repair of spina bifida is now considered standard of care at fetal specialty centers. Other conditions that potentially are treated by open fetal surgery include: * Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (if indicated at all, it is now more likely to be treated by endoscopic fetal surgery) * Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation * Congenital heart disease * Pulmonary sequestration * Sacrococcygeal teratoma = Minimally invasive fetal surgery = Minimally- invasive fetoscopic surgery has proven to be useful for some fetal conditions. * Twin-twin transfusion syndrome ‚Äì Laser Ablation of Vessels * Spina bifida ‚Äì Fetoscopic closure of the malformation. Prenatal repair of the spina bifida lesion through this approach has been purported to result in less complications to the mother, whilst affording benefit to the baby. History Fetal surgical techniques were first developed at the University of California, San Francisco in 1980 using animal models. On April 26, 1981, the first successful human open fetal surgery in the world was performed at University of California, San Francisco under the direction of Dr. Michael Harrison. The fetus in question had a congenital hydronephrosis, a blockage in the urinary tract that caused the kidney to dangerously extend. To correct this a vesicostomy was performed by placing a catheter in the fetus to allow the urine to be released normally. The blockage itself was removed surgically after birth. Further advances have been made in the years since this first operation. New techniques have allowed additional defects to be treated and for less invasive forms of fetal surgical intervention. The first two percutaneous ultrasound-guided fetal balloon valvuloplasties, a type of fetal surgery for severe aortic valve obstruction in the heart, were reported in 1991. Among the first dozen reported attempts at this repair in the 1990s, only two children survived long-term. Dr. Oluyinka Olutoye, alongside Darrell Cass, from the Texas Children's Fetal Centre, removed a 16 week old fetus from her mothers womb in order to perform surgery upon a spinal tumor she had. The girl was placed back in the womb after a 5 hour surgery and was born without complications.https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-05-09-born-twice-baby- removed-returned-to-womb-for-surgery/ List of hospitals with fetal surgery departments (or, at minimum, fetal surgical specialists) =North America= United States =Alabama= The Fetal Cardiac Diagnosis and Care Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB Medicine Russell Children's of Alabama Hospital Fetal Transfusion and Amnioinfusion Services in High-Risk OB-GYN Services at the University of South Alabama Children's and Women's Hospital =Arizona= The Fetal Care Center at Phoenix Children's Hospital (the Fetal Heart Center and Cardiology Program, Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Clinic, Nephrology, Neuroscience Center and neurosurgery, and Vascular Disorders, among others) Canada =Ontario= The Ontario Fetal Centre (OFC) at the Mount Sinai Hospitalhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai_Hospital_(Toronto)/ and in partnership with The Hospital for Sick Children is the first in Canada, and one of only a few centres worldwide, to offer a fully comprehensive range of fetal therapy. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hospital_for_Sick_Children_(Toronto)  See also  * ECMO * Fetoscopy * EXIT procedure * Maternal-fetal medicine, a discipline of high-risk obstetrics and gynecology; most fetal surgeons were previously trained in OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine before their fetal surgical training * Neonatology and neonatal surgery, related to high risk OB- GYN and maternal-fetal medicine and fetal surgery, are branches of pediatrics and pediatric surgery that focus on the treatment of newborn infants (less than one month of age) * Pediatric surgery, a related but distinct discipline of surgery and pediatrics, involving surgery on infants, toddlers, and children and adolescents * MOMS Trial * Spina bifida * NAFTNet * Samuel Armas References Further reading * External links * Pediatric Surgery Books Directory Surgery ","title":"Fetal surgery"},{"id":"4021625","text":"KFM may refer to: * Komet Flight Motor, an Italian aircraft engine manufacturer * Kearny fallout meter, an expedient radiation meter, which can be made from household items * The Kentucky Fried Movie, an American comedy film, released in 1977 and directed by John Landis * Keysi Fighting Method, a martial art with roots in Jeet Kun Do, Wing Chun, and street fighting * Knights of Father Matthew, a catholic temperance society that originated in Ireland * Komet Flight Motor, a division of IAME * KFM Records, a Scottish independent record label * The KDE file manager, now replaced by Konqueror * One of the following radio stations: ** KFM (Cape Town), Cape Town, South Africa ** Kfm, County Kildare, Ireland ** KFM Radio, an unlicensed radio station based in Stockport, Greater Manchester in the United Kingdom, now Imagine FM ** KFM, United Kingdom, now KMFM West Kent * Kelvin probe force microscope * Kommunistiska F√∂rbundet Marxist-Leninisterna, former Swedish communist party * Kronofogdemyndigheten, Swedish government agency handling debt collection, distraint and evictions ","title":"KFM"},{"id":"4021660","text":"Beevor's sign is medical sign seen in the selective weakness of the lower abdominal muscles, involving the movement of the navel towards the head on flexing the neck.

Pathophysiology Beevor‚Äôs sign is characteristic of spinal cord injury between T9 and T10 levels. This occurs when the upper part of the rectus abdominis muscle is intact but the lower part is weak because of the spinal injury. Thus when the patient is asked to raise his head as he lies supine on bed, only the upper part of the muscle contracts pulling the umbilicus toward the head. The sign has also been observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease causing progressive weakening of the muscles of multiple areas of the body, and in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a disease of weakness of predominantly the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles.

The film was directed by John Whitesell and written by Paul W. Shapiro. Set in 1962, it tells the story of three young men who go on a trip to Hollywood to fulfil their dream of meeting Marilyn Monroe. It has similarities to the real-life story of Gene Scanlon, who in 1953 crossed America with a friend and had a date with Marilyn Monroe for which she paid the bill.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID2MHknR4QU Plot While Marilyn Monroe is enjoying her rise to stardom and iconic pop culture status, three childhood friends are happy enough to sneakily obtain racy pictures of her for their pubescent enjoyment. Once they mature (at least by age), Roy has his eyes set on joining the Military despite his strained relationship with his father. His buddy, Scott, has a prosthetic leg and is to be married soon to his darling significant other Becky, and his other pal, Ned, known affectionately as \\"Bleuer\\", works at a small town store and is not initially as anxious to partake on this crazed notion as his friends. Thanks to Roy's Uncle, the three desirous and hapless friends shack up at his place out in California where they yearn to meet‚Äîif only for a brief second‚Äîthe fabulous and stunning Miss Marilyn Monroe. Their quest leads to shenanigans and silliness ensues as they arrange the most brainless ideas to win over their idol. One includes corralling a \\"sad\\" cow to moo outside of Miss Monroe's luxurious residence, another has the guys speeding after Marilyn towards a nude beach and an entirely separate subplot has them dodging some bad guys that are after Roy. Eventually, however, it is up to Marilyn to pity the trio's collectively desperate agony. The boys devise a clever scheme to avoid Miss Monroe's hawkish maid and Roy slips in the question, to which Marilyn refuses a date. This leads to further despair amongst the trio. They begin to regret coming out for the trip and they decide to go out on the town one last time. Surprisingly, in a sudden twist, Monroe finally does agree to a date upon the sandy splendor of the Californian beach. Initially, while animosity has grown between the three friends, Roy is designated to be the lucky one that gets to hopefully \\"canoe\\" Miss Monroe, but nonchalantly, he passes off the opportunity to his buddy \\"Bleuer\\" who surprisedly agrees and treats the lovely Miss Monroe to a wonderful platonic night. While Roy (in his macho way) is disappointed by Bleuer's effort, the boys return home to the sad news that Marilyn has abruptly died of a drug overdose. Back home, Scott continues his plans to marry his love, Becky, and Roy tussles with his father in the gym which leads to one last touching moment between the two before Roy is shipped out to boot camp. The last image seen is of Bleuer as he embraces his wild side and partakes in a wild telephone booth gathering that woos a local college girl in his favor.

Contrary to the ambitious Huan Wen, who at times considered seizing the throne, Huan Chong was known to be dedicated to the preservation of the imperial government. After Huan Wen's son Huan Xuan temporarily seized the throne as the emperor of Chu in 403, he posthumously honored Huan Chong as the Prince of Xuancheng. Early career under Huan Wen Huan Chong, one of Huan Wen's younger brothers (the other ones were Huan Yun (), Huan Huo, and Huan Mi (), was considered the most knowledgeable, and Huan Wen entrusted him with great responsibilities. By the time that he accompanied Huan Wen in his campaign against Yao Xiang () in 356, he was a governor of two commanderies and the military commander of seven. While on a campaign, he defeated and captured the rebel general Zhou Cheng (), and was made the Duke of Fengcheng and the governor of Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi and Fujian). The crisis of Huan Wen's succession By the time Huan Wen grew gravely ill in 373, Huan Wen was effectively in direct control of the western two thirds of the empire. As Huan Wen hesitated at seizing the throne and ultimately chose not to do so, he entrusted his command to Huan Chong, rather than his heir apparent Huan Xi (), because he considered Huan Xi lacking in the talent for military command. However, Huan Xi's younger brother Huan Ji (), along with Huan Mi, conspired to kill Huan Chong and take over. After Huan Wen died, Huan Chong acted first and arrested Huan Xi and Huan Ji. He then exiled Huan Mi and put Huan Xi and Huan Ji under house arrest. He instead reported to the imperial government that Huan Xuan, Huan Wen's youngest son, was designed by Huan Wen as heir, and the imperial government agreed to let the four-year-old Huan Xuan assume Huan Wen's title of Duke of Nan Commandery. There had been anticipation that there might be a confrontation between Huan Chong and the prime minister Xie An following Huan Wen's death. Xie avoided a direct confrontation by dividing Huan Wen's domain into three parts and putting them under the commands of Huan Chong, Huan Huo, and Huan Huo's son Huan Shixiu (), respectively. Huan Chong was allocated Yang (ÊèöÂ∑û, modern Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and southern Anhui) and Yu (Ë±´Â∑û, modern central Anhui) Provinces. Some of his advisors suggested that he kill some of the imperial officials and take over the imperial government, but he refused, and indeed returned the power to authorize executions (which Huan Wen had exercised) back to the imperial government. Later life, positions and death In 375, in further sign that he was showing submission to the imperial government, Huan Chong turned down the governorship of Yang Province (which included the capital Jiankang), instead becoming the governor of Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û, modern central and northern Jiangsu). Later, after Huan Huo's death in 377, Xie trusted Huan Chong sufficiently to give him the governorship of the important Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hunan and central and southern Hubei), as well as the military command over the western half of the empire‚Äînearly the domain that Huan Wen had controlled earlier. In 378, after a major attack by Former Qin led to the losses of the important cities of Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩ, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) and Weixing (È≠èËàà, in modern Ankang, Shaanxi), both of which were in his command zone and which he had failed to relieve, Huan Chong offered to resign, but his resignation was not accepted. In 383, when Former Qin launched another major attack, this time seeking to capture Jiankang and destroy Jin, Huan Chong was concerned about the capital's defenses and therefore sent several thousand elite soldiers to Xie to shore up Jiankang's defenses, which Xie declined, stating that the capital was already well- guarded (which, however, it actually was not). Upon receiving the soldiers back, Huan Chong lamented that while Xie was an able prime minister, he lacked military talent, making the exclamation, \\"I am finally going to have to wear barbarian clothes\\" (meaning that Jin would soon fall to Former Qin, which Huan considered a barbaric regime). After Former Qin forces were repelled at the Battle of Fei River, however, Huan Chong became embarrassed‚Äîand so much so that he grew ill. He died in early 384. Contrary to the customs for high level officials at the time, Huan Chong did not submit a petition to the emperor in his illness, asking for his family members to be given posts, but only wrote to Xie, lamenting that Huan Wen's youngest sons were still young and that he had thus failed in raising them properly, as Huan Wen asked him to. He was greatly praised at the time for this self-deprecation.

A new group of restaurants under the Gino's name, involving some of the principals of the original chain, was started in 2010. History The first Gino's was opened in Dundalk, Maryland, just outside Baltimore; it got its official name in 1959 when the owners Joe Campanella, Louis Fisher and Alan Ameche invited Colts' captain Gino Marchetti to become a partner. In 1967 Gino's merged with Tops Drive Inn, a chain of 18 drive-in restaurants located in the Washington, D.C., area; most Tops locations were rebranded as Gino's. In the early 1970s, the company attempted to expand from its East Coast base into the Midwest, however these locations only operated a short period. For one location, it purchased Orchestra Hall in Detroit and planned to demolish the structure to construct a restaurant. When the plan became public, it led to a grass-roots campaign to save and restore the abandoned structure. The chain had 359 company-owned locations when Marriott Corporation acquired it in 1982. Marriott discontinued the brand and converted locations to its Roy Rogers Restaurants chain. The last Gino's, located in Pasadena, Maryland and owned independently from Marriott, closed in 1986. Gino's also purchased and operated the Rustler Steak House chain started by Joe Campanella, which was sold by Marriott shortly after its purchase of Gino's. The restaurant was known for hamburgers such as the Sirloiner, which was made from sirloin steak (and was originally a staple of Tops Drive Inn), and the Gino Giant, which predated and later competed with the Big Mac. The company held the franchise for Kentucky Fried Chicken in the Mid-Atlantic states. The company's jingle, played during radio advertisements in the early years was \\"Everybody goes to Gino's, 'cause Gino's is the place to go!\\" The company also became known for its philanthropic efforts. Gino's Burgers and Chicken (2010) Marchetti, Romano, and Fischer have opened several new Gino's restaurants. Marchetti and Fischer will be serving as consultants. The new restaurants plan to serve burgers, chicken sandwiches, hand-cut french fries and hand-spun milkshakes. Initially, the chain plans to open locations in Pennsylvania and Maryland. In charge is Tom Romano, who worked for 20 years with the company, and was C.O.O. in 1982 when the chain was sold. \\"It's apparent there's a need for better burgers out there\\", said Romano, citing the success of such chains as Five Guys, and Gino's Burgers and Chicken has placed itself upscale of the earlier Gino's. Gino's plans to make its burgers to order from fresh beef. Their first location opened in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, the same town as the original chain's headquarters, on October 25, 2010. Plans were announced in Spring 2011 for franchise expansion into Baltimore. On August 17, 2011, a second Gino's location opened in Towson, Maryland. Another Gino's opened in Bensalem, Pennsylvania on October 11, 2011. A Gino's Burgers and Chicken opened in Oriole Park at Camden Yards at the start of the Orioles season in 2012, but closed by the end of the 2014 season. On January 22, 2013, Gino's Burgers and Chicken opened in Aberdeen, Maryland, however the Bensalem location closed around the same time. Later, on July 9, 2013, the King of Prussia location closed, effectively leaving the Philadelphia market. The location at Perry Hall, Maryland, which opened on March 5, 2012, closed on December 8, 2013. The Aberdeen location closed on March 27, 2016, leaving only the Towson and Glen Burnie locations.

Global version  Suppose a system is represented as : \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f \\\\left(\\\\mathbf x \\\\right) where \\\\mathbf x is the vector of variables, with : f \\\\left( \\\\mathbf 0 \\\\right) = \\\\mathbf 0. If a C^1 function V(\\\\mathbf x) can be found such that : \\\\dot{V}(\\\\mathbf x) \\\\le 0 for all \\\\mathbf x (negative semidefinite), then the set of accumulation points of any trajectory is contained in {\\\\mathcal I} where {\\\\mathcal I} is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf x : \\\\dot{V}( \\\\mathbf x) = 0 \\\\\\\\}. If we additionally have that the function V is positive definite, i.e. : V( \\\\mathbf x) > 0 , for all \\\\mathbf x eq \\\\mathbf 0 : V( \\\\mathbf 0) = 0 and if {\\\\mathcal I} contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory \\\\mathbf x(t) = \\\\mathbf 0 for t \\\\geq 0, then the origin is asymptotically stable. Furthermore, if V is radially unbounded, i.e. : V(\\\\mathbf x) \\\\to \\\\infty , as \\\\Vert \\\\mathbf x \\\\Vert \\\\to \\\\infty then the origin is globally asymptotically stable.  Local version  If : V( \\\\mathbf x) > 0 , when \\\\mathbf x eq \\\\mathbf 0 : \\\\dot{V}(\\\\mathbf x) \\\\le 0 hold only for \\\\mathbf x in some neighborhood D of the origin, and the set : \\\\\\\\{ \\\\dot{V}( \\\\mathbf x) = 0 \\\\\\\\} \\\\bigcap D does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory \\\\mathbf x(t)=\\\\mathbf 0, t \\\\geq 0, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally asymptotically stable.  Relation to Lyapunov theory  If \\\\dot{V} ( \\\\mathbf x) is negative definite, the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of Lyapunov's second theorem. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when \\\\dot{V} ( \\\\mathbf x) is only negative semidefinite.  Example: the pendulum with friction  This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local asymptotic stability of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation : m l \\\\ddot{\\\\theta} = - m g \\\\sin \\\\theta - k l \\\\dot{\\\\theta} where \\\\theta is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, m is the mass of the pendulum, l is the length of the pendulum, k is the friction coefficient, and g is acceleration due to gravity. This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations : \\\\dot{x}_1 = x_2 : \\\\dot{x}_2 = -\\\\frac{g}{l} \\\\sin x_1 - \\\\frac{k}{m} x_2 Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin x_1 = x_2 = 0 asymptotically converge to the origin. We define V(x_1,x_2) as : V(x_1,x_2) = \\\\frac{g}{l} (1 - \\\\cos x_1) + \\\\frac{1}{2} x_2^2 This V(x_1,x_2) is simply the scaled energy of the system Clearly, V(x_1,x_2) is positive definite in an open ball of radius \\\\pi around the origin. Computing the derivative, : \\\\dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \\\\frac{g}{l} \\\\sin x_1 \\\\dot{x}_1 + x_2 \\\\dot{x}_2 = - \\\\frac{k}{m} x_2^2 Observe that V(0) = \\\\dot{V}(0) = 0. If it were true that \\\\dot{V} < 0 , we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by Lyapunov's second theorem. Unfortunately, \\\\dot{V} \\\\leq 0 and \\\\dot{V} is only negative semidefinite since x_1 can be non-zero when \\\\dot{V}=0. However, the set : S = \\\\\\\\{ (x_1,x_2) \\\\dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \\\\\\\\} which is simply the set : S = \\\\\\\\{ (x_1,x_2) x_2 = 0 \\\\\\\\} does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory x = 0. Indeed, if at some time t, x_2(t)=0, then because x_1 must be less than \\\\pi away from the origin, \\\\sin x_1 eq 0 and \\\\dot{x}_2(t) eq 0 . As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set S. All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty .  History  The general result was independently discovered by J.P. LaSalle (then at RIAS) and N.N. Krasovskii, who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While LaSalle was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and Krasovskii, followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by Krasovskii .

Gantner was launched on 17 April 1943 by the Bethlehem Steel Company, Quincy, Massachusetts, sponsored by Mrs. Samuel M. Gantner, widow of Boatswain's Mate Gantner; commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 23 July 1943, with Lieutenant Commander Barklie M. Henry in command. Service history =World War II, 1943-1945= After shakedown out of Bermuda, Gantner escorted SS George Washington from Puerto Rico to New York, arriving there on 1 December 1943. She departed New York on 26 December 1943 as a part of the escort for a convoy which reached Derry, Northern Ireland on 8 January 1944. She returned to New York on 24 January and by 8 October had made seven more trans-Atlantic escort voyages from that port to Derry. Following repairs in the Boston Naval Shipyard and battle practice in Casco Bay, Gantner departed Boston on 3 November 1944 escorting fleet tug and towing concrete repair dock ARDC-1 to Crist√≥bal, Canal Zone. She then proceeded to Miami, Florida, to serve as floating school ship in waters extending to the Bahamas and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She departed Miami on 19 February 1945 for conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport in the New York Naval Shipyard. She was reclassified APD-42 on 23 February 1945. Gantner departed New York on 14 May 1945 for amphibious warfare landing exercises in the Chesapeake Bay area until 2 June, then proceeded via the Panama Canal and San Diego to Pearl Harbor where she reported for duty with the 5th Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, on 28 June. After training Underwater Demolition Teams in Maalea Bay until 3 August, she embarked UDT-3 at San Diego and sailed for the Far East via Hawaii and the Marshall Islands to Japan, entering Tokyo Bay on 4 September. Her frogmen reconnoitered beaches and reported on suitability of landing Army occupation forces at Shiogama Wan and Ominato Ko, Honsh≈´, Japan. From 30 September to 7 October 1945, her swimmers made surveys for the Port Director, Otaru, Hokkaid≈ç with the help of United States Army advance parties ashore. Gantner departed Tokyo Bay on 12 October 1945 to embark a returning Marine contingent at Apra Harbor, Guam, and sailed thence via the Marshalls and Hawaii to San Diego where she disembarked military passengers on 1 November 1945. =1946-1949 = For the next three years she was based at San Diego, largely employed as an amphibious warfare training ship for Marines. From 26 January to 6 March 1946 she made a cruise from San Diego with the 1st Marine Division Reconnaissance Detachment for cold weather maneuvers that took her to Kodiak, Juneau, Tolstoi Bay and Clarence Strait, Alaska. Her amphibious schedule on the California coast was again interrupted on 28 October-18 November 1948 by a cruise northward to act as guard ship on weather and air- sea rescue patrol station for Navy patrol planes scouting north to Seattle, and thence back to San Francisco. Gantner resumed her amphibious training out of San Diego until 19 January 1949 when she sailed for Shanghai, China. She reached her destination on 14 February and served on station at the Chinese ports of Shanghai, Nanking and Tsingtao. Departing the last named port on 7 April, she accompanied the escort carrier to Yokosuka, Japan, then sailed via Guam and Pearl Harbor for the west coast, arriving at San Diego on 4 May 1949. =Decommissioning and sale to the Republic of China= Gantner was decommissioned on 2 August 1949, and was assigned to the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Navy List on 15 January 1966. On 22 February 1966, Gantner was sold to Nationalist China under the Military Assistance Program. The ex-Gantner collided on 17 April 1966 with ex-Walter B. Cobb (former APD-106), while both were under tow to Taiwan, resulting in the loss of ex-Walter B. Cobb. Ex-Gantner was commissioned into the Republic of China Navy in May 1966 as frigate Wen Shan (PF-34). With a different hull number, 834, Wen Shan was scrapped in 1991.

W49AI dropped Fox and WOFL around 1991, when Ocala's WOGX affiliated with the Fox network. At that point, it offered more local programming, plus shows from other satellite networks, like America One (later becoming Youtoo America) and My Family TV. WYKE has also aired religious programming from Faith TV and Orlando independent station WACX. In May 1995, W49AI became WYKE- LP, named after the Key Training Center in Inverness, where Citrus County's handicapped learn basic occupational skills for employment. On February 9, 2005, WYKE relocated to channel 47 and became a Class-A station (though they kept the \\"-LP\\" suffix). Soon after, on March 21, 2005, the station completed a flash-cut to digital, becoming one of the first licensed digital Class-A stations in the United States. The station would not adopt a \\"-CD\\" suffix until 2009, however. The station is licensed to \\"Inglis-Yankeetown\\", two cities in Levy County‚Äîpart of the Gainesville market. However, its transmitter, studios (in Lecanto), and coverage area are located in Citrus County‚Äîpart of the Tampa Bay market.  Newscasts  WYKE presently airs a half hour morning show called Citrus Today, hosted by Dennis Miller. Originally called Citrus Sunrise, the show airs weekdays at 9:30am and features local news and public affairs segments. In the past, the station has aired simulcasts of Gainesville ABC affiliate WCJB's morning, evening, and late newscasts.

He also went by the pseudonym Rudolf Berg.cited by: Manfred Seidenfu√ü: Geschichtsdidaktik(er) im Griff des Nationalsozialismus?, p. 161, footnote 2  Youth and early career development  Memorial to the Rieseburg murdered r√©gime opponents. Klagges was the youngest of a forest ranger's seven children. He underwent training as a Volksschule teacher at the teaching seminary at Soest and worked as such beginning in 1911 in Harpen near Bochum. During the First World War he was badly wounded and therefore discharged from army service by 1916. In 1918 he joined the German National People's Party and stayed with the party until 1924. After the First World War, he became a Realschule teacher in Wilster in Holstein. After leaving the German National People's Party, Klagge was for a short time a member of the extreme rightwing German Nationalist Freedom Party (Deutschv√∂lkische Freiheitspartei), which had been founded late in 1922. He soon left it, eventually joining the NSDAP in 1925. From 1926 until 1930 he worked as a deputy headmaster at a middle school in Benneckenstein (now in Saxony-Anhalt), where from 1928 to 1930 he also served as the local Nazi Ortsgruppe leader. Because of his membership in the Party, he was dismissed from the Prussian school service and stripped of his pension. In the same year, he first rose to prominence in Braunschweig, where he busied himself as a Nazi propaganda speechmaker. = Writings = From 1921 on, Klagges was busy writing v√∂lkisch, antidemocratic, and anti-Semitic writings which appeared in right-wing newspapers and the like. He wrote for example for Die v√∂lkische Schule or Deutschlands Erneuerung and was himself the publisher of the magazine Nordlicht. His partly theological publications were moulded by radical religious racism.  Political office in Braunschweig  In the municipal elections in the state of Braunschweig on 1 March 1931, the Nazi party against expectation emerged as the third strongest party (10 seats) behind the SPD and KPD (18 seats between them). =Appointment to a government office= Anton Franzen and Hitler On 1 January 1931 Klagges was appointed Regierungsrat (a lower rank government official) in the Education Ministry by Anton Franzen, the Interior and Education Minister of the Braunschweig Free State and a fellow member of the NSDAP. After long political quarrels and intrigues, however, Franzen had to step down only a few months later owing to favouritism for a fellow party member. Franz Groh, chairman of the NSDAP faction, also had to step down; this triggered an internal political crisis in the Free State, threatening a coalition breakdown. = Election to State Minister = Owing to the imminent crisis in the Free State, Adolf Hitler intervened in the matter and gave the German National People's Party an ultimatum, which in the end led to Klagges being elected by the Braunschweig Landtag (the state parliament) to State Minister for the Interior and Education, thereby also becoming a member of the Braunschweig State Government, on 15 September 1931. Shortly thereafter, in 1932, Klagges also became a member of the Reichstag. Already in 1931, two years before the Nazis seized power, came professional bans, through Klagges's actions, against Social Democrats and Jews, which struck, among others, many teaching staff at the Braunschweig Technical College. = Naturalizing Adolf Hitler = The City of Braunschweig bears the stigma of being responsible for the former Austrian citizen ‚Äì and since 1925, at his instigation, stateless person ‚Äì Adolf Hitler's getting his first official job on 25 February 1932. He was a Regierungsrat (low-rank government official) at the Braunschweig State Culture and Surveying Office, stationed as a staff member of the Braunschweig legation in Berlin. This had the effect of granting Hitler German citizenship. The city itself, however, played no role in his naturalization; rather, it was Free State's, in whose name this deed was done by the State Minister for the Interior and Education, namely NSDAP member Dietrich Klagges. Unlike in the City of Braunschweig, by 1930, the National Socialists were already quite politically influential in the Braunschweig Free State. For Hitler, an appointment to a government office in Braunschweig was the only opportunity to obtain German citizenship, since the Free State was the only state in the Weimar Republic with Nazis in government who could influence and control the \\"F√ºhrer's\\" naturalization. For this reason, the Free State's government ‚Äì or more precisely its State Minister, Klagges ‚Äì was given the direct request by the NSDAP party leadership for Hitler's naturalization. Joseph Goebbels referred to the matter in his diary on 4 February 1932: The intention is to appoint the F√ºhrer an associate professor.  Professor Hitler  Klagges first tried to procure for Hitler an associate professorship in the made-up discipline of \\"Politics and Organic Sociology\\" at the Braunschweig Technical College. This plan soon leaked out to the public and then failed miserably in the face of opposition from, among others, the technical college's own leadership and educators themselves. (The now-renamed University of Braunschweig did not want someone who had never finished school.) The plan had to be dropped. Without meaning to, Klagges had given the Nazi Party the very thing that they had wanted to avoid at all costs: their intentions had now been made public and Hitler had become a target of ridicule. Moreover, Hitler's reputation had been damaged ‚Äì and not only in Braunschweig ‚Äì and Klagges would later get the \\"bill\\" for it.  Regierungsrat Hitler  There followed yet another attempt to get Hitler a government job, this time by Dr. Wessels, a German People's Party (DVP) Member of the Reichstag, who suggested that a post be procured for Hitler in the Braunschweig Legation at the Reichsrat in Berlin. This second try met with success in the end: On 25 February 1932, Hitler was successfully sworn in, making Hitler a citizen of Braunschweig, and thus of Germany. At the same time, he won the right to stand as a candidate in the 1932 Reich presidential election. In the Braunschweigische Landeszeitung newspaper, Klagges declared a short time later: :\\"If our participation in the government in Braunschweig had had no further success than procuring citizenship for our F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler, then this fact alone is enough to prove the necessity of our participation in the government.\\" Hitler's job at the legation did not last long. On 16 February 1933 the new Reichskanzler requested in a short telegram discharge from the Braunschweig State Service, which was promptly granted \\"effective immediately\\". Break between Hitler and Klagges  Hitler's naturalization was supposed to be dealt with quickly and above all, inconspicuously, without the public getting any knowledge of it. However, with Klagges's clumsy way of doing things, the whole business grew into a farce for the later \\"F√ºhrer\\", since the first attempt failed miserably, and publicly. Only on the second try was the coup successful. Hitler never forgave Klagges this public exposure and personal humiliation and settled the score with him on 17 July 1935 on his last visit to Braunschweig, which resulted in Klagges's de facto disempowerment. Henceforth, Klagges was to submit all plans to Reichsstatthalter Wilhelm Loeper in Dessau as well as Reichsminister Hanns Kerrl for approval, thereby being degraded to provincial politician and thrust off the stage of higher NSDAP politics. It is also likely that Klagges had only Hermann G√∂ring's pull in these matters to thank for not being dismissed by Hitler on the spot (which did not last much beyond 1940 anyway). = The Braunschweig Free State after the Nazis seize power = Almost immediately after 30 January 1933 came acts of terror in Braunschweig against those who disagreed with the National Socialist, followed by more such acts as the year wore on.  Appointment as Premier of the Braunschweig Free State  On 6 May 1933, Klagges was appointed Ministerpr√§sident of the Braunschweig Free State by Reichsstatthalter Wilhelm Loeper. Klagges's formulated goal was the creation of a National Socialist model province. Only a few days later, the first book burnings took place in Braunschweig at the Schlossplatz.  National Socialist model province  Klagges's plans for a National Socialist model province entailed the goal of further keeping Braunschweig as independent as possible from Berlin's overlordship so that he could go on running his little \\"Reich\\" as he deemed fit, doing whatever he liked to do. Klagges would not hear of his province being integrated into Prussia ‚Äì as this would have put an end to the faction that he led ‚Äì despite Hitler's assurances that Braunschweig would still be a cultural centre, and not merely part of a new \\"Reichsgau Hannover\\". The province was also to remain in place after the foreseen war. To hold onto ‚Äì and broaden ‚Äì his own power, Klagges next tried to bring into being a new Gau ‚Äì one that would also be independent of Hanover. It would include not only the Braunschweig but also the Regierungsbezirk of L√ºneburg and Hildesheim and would be called \\"Gau Ostfalen\\". Its capital would be Braunschweig and the Gauleiter would be, of course, himself. Klagges found support for his idea among Braunschweig educators, from the middle class, the chamber of commerce, and even the Protestant Church. To this end, Klagges undertook several things to strengthen Braunschweig's political and economic position in Germany: As of June 1933, a new suburb of Braunschweig, the \\"Dietrich Klagges Garden City\\" (Gartenstadt Dietrich Klagges) was built. Furthermore, he brought many important Nazi institutions to the city, such as the Academy for Youth Leadership (Akademie f√ºr Jugendf√ºhrung), the German Research Centre for Aviation (Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Luftfahrt), the F√ºhrer School for German Trades and Crafts (F√ºhrerschule des deutschen Handwerks), the Regional F√ºhrer School of the Hitler Youth (Gebietsf√ºhrerschule der Hitler-Jugend), the Luftwaffe Command 2, the Reich Hunting Lodge (Reichsj√§gerhof, intended to impress passionate hunter G√∂ring), the SS Ensigns' School (SS-Junkerschule), the SS Upper Division \\"Middle\\", and also the Bernhard Rust College for Teacher Training. Klagges also further developed Braunschweig's infrastructure by connecting it to the newly built Autobahn and the Mittellandkanal. In the end, thanks to Klagges, Braunschweig also became a centre of the National Socialist armament industry, since important industrial hubs were growing right nearby, namely the Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring in Salzgitter (on whose board of directors Klagges was as of 1937), and the Volkswagen Works in Fallersleben (now part of Wolfsburg).  Persecuting political dissenters  What follows is a few examples of how and by what means Dietrich Klagges persecuted politically undesirable persons (or had them persecuted), sometimes to death (see also \\"Klagge trials\\" below). = The Rieseberg Murders = The SPD's Volksfreundhaus A short time after the Nazis' seizure of power, the first acts of terror were seen in both the City and Province of Braunschweig in which the so-called \\"Hilfspolizei\\" (\\"Auxiliary Police\\") stood out. This force was directly answerable to Klagges and consisted of SA, SS and Der Stahlhelm men. Their actions were aimed mainly at members of various labour organizations, the SPD, the KPD, and also against Jews. They were carried out with extraordinary brutality. Klagges was therefore responsible for at least 25 Nazi r√©gime opponents' deaths. The murder of eleven communists and labour organisers in Rieseberg (about 15 miles east of Braunschweig) by members of the SS on 4 July 1933 was the most important of these events. There was to have been a judicial inquiry into the circumstances of the arrestees' deaths, but Klagges assisted in blocking and suppressing it. = Ernst B√∂hme = AOK Building\\", the Hilfspolizei's \\"protective custody\\" prison Lawyer and SPD member (1892‚Äì1968) was from 1929 until 1933 the democratically elected Mayor of the City of Braunschweig. After the National Socialists had risen to power, however, he found himself the target of growing repressive measures and ever greater persecution by Klagges, who on 13 March 1933 ordered B√∂hme's ouster and had him taken to the disused AOK Building, which was being used by the Nazis as a \\"protective custody\\" prison, as they called it. B√∂hme had the dedication of former Braunschweig Ministerpr√§sident Heinrich Jasper (who had likewise been persecuted by Klagges) to thank for the return of his freedom a short time later. Shortly thereafter, however, B√∂hme was once again arrested and this time is taken to the SPD's own, but now disused, Volksfreundhaus where he was mishandled. He was forced to sign a document declaring that he had given up his mandate. After he was let go, B√∂hme left Braunschweig and came back only in 1945. On 1 June 1945, Ernst B√∂hme was given back his mayoralty by the United States military administration. He stayed on as mayor until 17 December 1948. = Heinrich Jasper = Heinrich Jasper Lawyer and SPD member Heinrich Jasper (1875‚Äì1945) was, among other things, a city councillor since 1903, an SPD factional chairman in Braunschweig's Landtag, member of the Weimar National Assembly as well as Braunschweig State Minister between 1919 and 1930 and several times the Braunschweig Free State's premier. Jasper was, at Klagges's instigation, taken into \\"protective custody\\" on pretences on 17 March 1933, and taken to the AOK Building, where he was severely beaten in an attempt to force him to resign his political mandate, which Jasper, however, would not do. He was next taken to the Volksfreundhaus where he faced further mishandling until his temporary release on 19 April. On 26 June 1933, Jasper was once again arrested and taken to Dachau concentration camp, from which he was released in 1939 under circumstances that have yet to be explained. Jasper then returned to Braunschweig where he was placed under constant surveillance and had to report daily to the Gestapo. The failed attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia on 20 July 1944 furnished another pretense on which to arrest Jasper yet again on 22 August 1944. After spending time in various concentration camps, he ended up at Bergen-Belsen where he is believed to have died on 19 February 1945 of typhus. = August Merges = August Merges (1870‚Äì1945) belonged to various leftwing parties, was one of the leaders of the November Revolution in Braunschweig and was President of the Socialist Republic of Braunschweig. After 1933 he moved out of active party work and joined the resistance against the Nazi r√©gime. In April 1935, he was arrested together with other resistance fighters and severely beaten. He was sentenced for high treason but was released early, in 1937, for medical reasons. On Klagges's instructions, he was arrested once more and taken into \\"protective custody\\". After Merges had once more been set free, he was nevertheless repeatedly picked up by the Gestapo and detained for a short time. He died as a result of mishandling suffered at the Gestapo's hands.  Forced labour and concentration camps  Beginning on 21 January 1941, Klagges started having Braunschweig's Jews deported to the concentration camps. In 1944, there were 91,000 forced labourers in the Watenstedt- Salzgitter, Braunschweig and Helmstedt area. This was far and away the highest density at labour camps anywhere in the Reich. Indeed, a great number of the people killed in the massive air raid on 15 October 1944 were forced labourers and camp inmates. When US troops occupied Braunschweig on 12 April 1945, there were still 61,000 prisoners in the camps.  War's end and postwar developments  On 12 April 1945, Klagges was taken prisoner by the American troops thronging into Braunschweig, and in 1946, a military court in Bielefeld sentenced him to six years in labour prison (Zuchthaus) for crimes committed in his function as SS Gruppenf√ºhrer (the highest rank that he reached in the SS, in 1942, was actually Obergruppenf√ºhrer; he was furthermore \\"Honorary Leader\\" of the 49th SS Standard). = The Klagges Trials = The new General Prosecutor Fritz Bauer, who had come to Braunschweig in 1950, and who was later active in the 1960s, likewise as a prosecutor, in the Auschwitz Trials, contributed to a great extent to getting Klagges sentenced in a normal criminal trial on 4 April 1950 to a life term in labour prison for crimes committed by him as Braunschweig State Minister and Premier, including, among others, the Rieseberg murders. The Bundesgerichtshof (a federal court), however, overturned this sentence in 1952. In a second trial in which it could be proved that Klagges had taken part in murders, torture, false imprisonment, and so on, and that he had planned (by himself or with others) these deeds, his prison term was reduced to 15 years. In his defence, Klagges put it to the court that he had known nothing about all that, as he had only worked from a desk and he was deceived by his underlings as to the true extent of the Nazi terror that was being perpetrated. In 1955, Klagges's wife applied for her husband's early release from prison without further probationary conditions. This first application was rejected, as was another one made the next year. In 1957, however, Klagges was released after having served about 80% of his prison term, and moved with his wife to Bad Harzburg, where he busied himself mainly with editing rightwing writings and maintaining contacts with neo-Nazi groups in Lower Saxony until he died in 1971. In 1970, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (another federal court) decided that Klagges had to receive an amount accumulated from his pension as premier (Ministerpr√§sident), approximately DM 100,000.

Paringa is famous for its vineyards, almond, citrus and stone fruit orchards, and the steel bridge with a span that can be raised to allow houseboats and paddlesteamers to pass underneath and across the Murray River to Renmark. At the 2006 census, Paringa had a population of 946. Railway The railway line from Tailem Bend was extended north to Paringa soon after it had reached the Brown's Well district, with the official opening on 3 October 1913. However it took another 14 years for the railway to cross the river, when the bridge and the railway to Renmark opened in January 1927. The railway eventually extended to Barmera by August 1928. The historic Paringa Bridge was designed to carry a single railway line in the centre, with a road lane on each side of it. It has a total of six spans, including one lift span to allow river traffic to pass underneath. It was opened on 31 January 1927, enabling the railway to extend to Renmark. It is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. The railway closed December 1990 but the bridge continues to carry the Sturt Highway as part of the main road link between Adelaide and Sydney. The town today Paringa today is a satellite town to the much larger Renmark, 4 km downstream. It boasts a pub, general store, museum and antiques shop. It is a service centre for the large agricultural enterprises on the Murtho and Lindsay Point roads. There is a beautiful picnic area on the riverfront adjacent to the Bridge.

Between 1989 and 1996, IBM delivered four additional releases, culminating in V3R5. *In December 1997, IBM announced a TPNS V3R5 Service Level 9711 Functional and Service Enhancements release. *In September 1998, IBM announced Teleprocessing Network Simulator (TPNS) Test Manager (for TPNS V3R5) as a usability enhancement to automate the test process further in order to improve productivity through a logical flow, and to streamline TPNS-based testing of IBM 3270 applications or CPI-C transaction programs. *In December 2001, IBM announced a TPNS V3R5 Service Level 0110 Functional and Service Enhancements release. *In August 2002, IBM announced Workload Simulator for z/OS and S/390 (WSim) V1.1 as Program Number 5655-I39, a re-packaged successor product to TPNS, alongside Workload Simulator for z/OS and S/390 (WSim) Test Manager V1.1, a re-packaged successor to TPNS Test Manager. Features =Simulation support= Teleprocessing Network Simulator (TPNS) TPNS supports the simulation of a wide range of networking protocols and devices: SNA/SDLC, start-stop, BSC, TWX, TTY, X.25 Packet Switching Network, Token ring Local Area Networking, and TCP/IP servers and clients (Telnet 3270 & 5250, Telnet Line Mode Network Virtual Terminal, FTP and simple UDP clients). TPNS can also simulate devices using the Airline Line Control (ALC) and the HDLC protocols. The full implementation of SNA in TPNS enables it to simulate all LU types (including LU6.2 and CPI-C), PU types (including PU2.1), and SSCP functions. Finally, TPNS also provides extensive user exit access to its internal processes to enable the simulation of user-defined (home-grown) line disciplines, communications protocols, devices (terminals and printers) and programs. TPNS is therefore the appropriate test tool for installations that need to test: * either the entire system configuration path of hardware and software components, from the teleprocessing line interface (modem, for example) all the way to the subsystem (CICS, IMS, DB2, TSO/ISPF, etc.), the application and finally to the file or database record (disk I/O) and back; : _Note:_ In this configuration, TPNS transmits its generated data traffic from its MVS address space, first across a channel-adapter to its TPNS Control Program (TPNCP) running in a dedicated IBM 37x5 Communications Controller, and then across teleprocessing lines connected back-to-back between the TPNCP and the target IBM 37x5 channel-attached to the host system (server) under test and its subsystems, applications and databases/files. * or only application systems and their hardware and software components, from the networking access method API (either the VTAM API or the TCP/IP High Performance Native Sockets, or Macro, API) to the subsystem (CICS, IMS, DB2, TSO/ISPF, etc.), the application and finally to the file or database record (disk I/O) and back; : _Note:_ In this configuration, TPNS transmits its generated data traffic from its MVS address space to the target application directly across the networking access method's API and does not, therefore, require a dedicated IBM 37x5 Communications Controller to run its TPNCP, or any other networking hardware and software components except the networking access method (VTAM or IBM TCP/IP for MVS) that already runs in--or is already network-connected to--the host system (server) under test. * or both. Workload Simulator for z/OS and S/390 (WSim) WSim fully supports a subset of TPNS-simulated devices and programmed resources: CPI-C, Retrieved on January 13, 2016. TCP/IP servers and clients (Telnet 3270 & 5250, Telnet Line Mode Network Virtual Terminal, FTP and simple UDP clients), and SNA LU simulation. WSim relies solely on software interfaces to communicate with the system under test. WSim is therefore the appropriate test tool for installations that need to test application systems and their hardware and software components, from the networking access method API (either the VTAM API or the TCP/IP High Performance Native Sockets, or Macro, API) to the subsystem (CICS, IMS, DB2, TSO/ISPF, etc.), the application and finally to the file or database record (disk I/O) and back; that is to say, without the need to install any networking hardware and software components except the networking access method (VTAM or IBM TCP/IP for MVS) that already runs in--or is already network-connected to--the host system (server) under test. =Scripting languages= TPNS language TPNS initially provided its own 'TPNS language', a high-level, macro assembler-like language with programming statements and operands that a test programmer would use to define: *the configuration of the network device(s) to be simulated (NTWRK definitions, simply called the network), typically one or more terminal(s), such as IBM 3270 display screen(s); *one or more message text script(s) (MSGTXT definitions, simply called scripts), corresponding to the keystrokes and data transmission activity of the simulated user(s) at the simulated terminal(s). Separate scripts could be written to perform specific test scenarios, such as: 'login', 'data enquiry', 'data entry' and 'logout', for example; *the sequence in which scripts are to be executed by each (or all) simulated terminal(s): ** in the NTWRK, one or more PATH statement(s) define(s) the order in which MSGTXTs are executed, ** each NTWRK terminal has a PATH operand that names the PATH statement(s) assigned to the terminal. Once defined, these test scripts are executed during the simulation run, when the TPNS program ITPENTER (the simulator) processes the submitted statements and creates data streams in the required formats and protocols, prior to sending them to the system under test as if they had originated from real user(s) operating real terminal(s). In turn, the target application(s) running in the system under test respond(s) to the simulated terminal(s) and, if the simulation is successful, these exchanges would continue until the programmed scripts reach the end of the simulation run, at which time ITPENTER is terminated by the test programmer. During the simulation, ITPENTER keeps a log (on tape or disk) of all messages exchanged between the simulated device(s) and the real application(s) under test. After the simulation has completed, the test programmer can therefore run any of three TPNS-supplied log analysis utilities to list and review the data exchanges in detail (ITPLL), Retrieved on January 13, 2016 to calculate and print response times reports (ITPRESP), or to compare the 3270 screen images logged during two simulation runs of the same script(s) and report on differences between them (ITPCOMP). When TPNS was re-packaged and renamed 'WSim' in 2002, the term 'TPNS language' was changed to 'WSim language' in the product publications; however, all TPNS components re-packaged into WSim--such as the TPNS program names (ITPxxxxx), for example--retained their identity and the existing nomenclature was maintained. Structured Translator Language (STL) With TPNS V3R1 (1989), IBM added the Structured Translator Language --or 'STL', a TPNS high-level scripting language with a syntax based on REXX-- to make it easier for test scripts to be written by programmers familiar with REXX or similar structured programming languages. STL therefore made it possible to write test scripts, not only for the usual activity of simulated terminal operators, but also for exchanges between TPNS-simulated programs and real application programs or, for example, to prototype elements of an ATM shared network. Scripts written in STL must be translated into the TPNS language before the simulation run and a translator utility (ITPSTL) is supplied for that purpose. Another way of defining STL would be as a 'script generation language'; its programming clauses are identical to REXX, but they need to be translated (i.e. 'script-generated') into the TPNS language in order to be executable during the simulation run. Script coding facilities Both scripting languages provide a comprehensive set of coding facilities that enable the test programmer to: *specify the input data (TEXT) entered by the simulated user(s), along with related actions: think time delays (DELAY), pressing function keys (ENTER, PF3, etc.) and waiting for responses (WAIT) from the application under test; *logic-test the content of incoming and/or outgoing messages and taking one of a wide range of optional actions according to the results of the evaluation (IF-THEN-ELSE); *set up test verification clauses that create log records for 'predicted good'/'predicted bad' conditions (VERIFY); *group message text data in user tables, to make scripts more generic and data-independent (MSGUTBL); *invoke an extensive range of data field options, to create test data dynamically into messages; *collect real-time data into save areas, during the simulation run, to re-use as 'on-the-fly' test data; *generate random numbers; *maintain a wide range of counters and switches; *set up events to synchronise the activity of simulated users (ON/SIGNAL, WAIT/POST); *set up named queues to provide a queuing method for passing data between simulated resources (QUEUE); *perform sequential file I/O (QSAM) operations from a script to a user- defined, external dataset; *select script debugging facilities, including a message generation trace which logs the step-by-step flow of all logic tests, actions (taken and ignored), and data exchanges occurring during the execution of scripts (MSGTRACE); *log message traffic during the simulation run, for post-processing analysis (including test data verification, response time calculation and screen image comparison across repeated simulations of the same scripts); *define and alter the rate at which message traffic is generated during the simulation run (EMTRATE); *specify the protocols for session initiation and termination between simulated programmed resources and real programs, as well as for data exchanges between them; *and many more. WSim supports the same scripting language facilities as TPNS, except that its network configuration (NTWRK) definitions require only those statements provided for CPI-C, TCP/IP servers and clients (Telnet 3270 & 5250, Telnet Line Mode Network Virtual Terminal, FTP and simple UDP clients), and SNA LU simulation. Repeatability One of the benefits of using test scripts is that they can be run repeatedly throughout the test cycle, as functional errors and/or system-wide defects are gradually resolved over time, in order to improve the reliability, capacity or performance of any, or all, hardware or software components in the system under test. For functional and regression testing, test programmers would typically define a network of just one simulated terminal executing test scripts tailored to evaluate a comprehensive set of transactions (database enquiry or data entry) serially, and at slow or average rates of message traffic. For system testing, performance/capacity testing, stress testing and benchmarking, the same test programmers would define large networks of dozens or even thousands of simulated terminals, each running--for example--a range of these functional test scripts, now grouped together to exercise as many system components as possible at high rates of message traffic. =Script generation= TPNS provides a number of solutions to automate the creation of test scripts. The script generation facilities described in the next three sections are also available in Workload Simulator for z/OS and S/390 (WSim). The Interactive Data Capture (IDC) script generator (ITPIDC) The Interactive Data Capture (IDC) script generator is a 'pass-through & data intercept' VTAM application (ITPIDC) controlled by the test programmer from _one_ real 3270 display screen in session with a target application for which a script is required. ITPIDC maintains two SNA sessions simultaneously: a primary LU session with the real 3270 terminal operated by the test programmer, and a secondary LU session with the target application. During the data capture-or 'recording'-session, ITPIDC logs the data traffic exchanged between the test programmer's real 3270 device and the target application, and then uses that log to generate the equivalent script, in either of the two scripting languages (TPNS language or STL). Since the IDC log dataset is in exactly the same format as the log dataset TPNS creates during a simulation run, it can be used as input to the TPNS post-processing utilities to print its contents, to calculate response times of the IDC session, or to compare the screen images of the data capture session with the TPNS log obtained by running the IDC-generated script. The 3270 trace reformatter and script generator (ITPLU2RF & ITPLSGEN) When capturing the activity of a production network consisting of _one_ or _many_ 3270 devices, the 3270 trace reformatter and script generator processes the trace dataset produced by the IBM Network Performance Monitor (NPM V1R4 or later) VTAM PIU log (FNMVLOG), or by the IBM VTAM (V4R1 or later) Full Buffer Trace. When the tracing activity is completed, a utility (ITPLU2RF) reformats the trace dataset into a log dataset in the format required as input to the IDC script generator (see previous section), which can also create scripts in batch mode (ITPLSGEN). This reformatted IDC log can also be analyzed by the three post- processing utilities (list the log's contents, calculate response times or compare screen images). The script generator (ITPSGEN) The script generator processes the trace dataset produced by the IBM Network Performance Monitor (NPM), or by the IBM VTAM Buffer Trace in conjunction with the IBM Generalized Trace Facility (GTF), when tracing a production network of _one_ or _many_ 3270 devices, as well as devices of various types and protocols, including LU0, LU1, LU2, LU4, LU 6.2 and CPI-C resources. For CPI-C script generation, it is also possible to use the LU 6.2 trace dataset created by the OS/2 Communications Manager (CM/2) or the IBM Communications Server. Different TPNS-supplied utilities reformat any of these various trace datasets into a single-format dataset used as input to the script generator (ITPSGEN), which produces scripts: * optionally in either language (TPNS language or STL) for all supported device types except CPI-C programmed resources; * only in STL for CPI-C programmed resources. The TCP/IP script generator (ITPIPGEN) The TCP/IP script generator is unique to WSim and was introduced in December 2015. It processes a TCP/IP trace dataset produced by the WSim-supplied TCP/IP Trace Utility (ITPIPTRX), which invokes the z/OS Communication Server real- time, application-controlled TCP/IP trace Network Management Interface (NMI) to capture TCP/IP data trace records. These trace records contain HTTP messages (packets and data) exchanged between a server and client. The TCP/IP script generator (ITPIPGEN) then processes this trace dataset and creates a script, in the STL language, which replicates the communication that occurred between the server and client. After translation from STL into the WSim language and when running the simulation (ITPENTER), the generated script sends the client messages--obtained from the trace--to the server port, and waits to receive a message from the server. A separate utility (ITPIPFMT) is also supplied to format and print the contents of the trace dataset created by the TCP/IP Trace Utility (ITPIPTRX). The Test Manager It is established practice that a script obtained from a script generator is subsequently edited by test programmers in order to make such scripts more generally reusable. This editing process consists in adding advanced script- programming clauses that script generators cannot supply, such as re-locating hard-coded data into user data tables that can then be expanded with more test data, for example. This editing can be done directly into the NTWRK and MSGTXT datasets, or through the services of the TPNS Test Manager (or its affiliated WSim Test Manager) which, like TPNS (and WSim), also runs under TSO/ISPF. The Test Manager is a knowledge-based, interactive usability tool designed to boost the productivity of test personnel, and to optimize the test cycle by enabling test projects to be organized methodically during the development and execution of test cases, and in the subsequent analysis of test results. Retrieved on January 13, 2016. =Run-time interfaces= In its early releases, the TPNS program ITPENTER (the simulator) ran as a MVS procedure controlled from the MVS operator console. Its generated data traffic was transmitted from its MVS address space, first across a channel-adapter to its TPNS Control Program (TPNCP) running in a dedicated IBM 37x5 Communications Controller, and then across teleprocessing lines connected back-to-back between the TPNCP and the target IBM 37x5 channel-attached to the host system under test and its application subsystems (CICS, IMS, DB2, TSO/ISPF, etc.). Running under TSO With TPNS V1R5 (1979), ITPENTER was enhanced to run from a TSO command list (in the TSO user address space) and therefore to operate simulations from a remote display terminal in the VTAM network instead of the MVS system console. Running as a VTAM application With TPNS V2R3 (1985), ITPENTER was enhanced to run as a VTAM application, thus sending the data traffic generated by its simulated terminals or programmed resources (now defined as VTAM logical units) via the VTAM API to the application under test. This removed the requirement for a 37x5 and other dedicated teleprocessing hardware when using TPNS to test applications systems running under VTAM, such as CICS, IMS, DB2, ISPF, and other online transaction processing systems. Display Monitor With TPNS V2R4 (1987), ITPENTER was enhanced with the Display Monitor, so that the screen images of a simulated 3270 display could be externalized onto a real 3270 terminal, thus enabling test personnel to monitor the ongoing, live execution of a script during the simulation run, in real time. It also became possible to operate TPNS from the NetView console and, in turn, to automate TPNS simulation runs from NetView by means of TPNS-supplied NetView command lists. Running under ISPF With TPNS V3R3 (1992), all TPNS programs and utilities (ITPxxxxx) could be operated entirely from ISPF in a panel-driven fashion, instead of through the TSO command line, or through discrete JCL job streams. Running as a TCP/IP for MVS application With TPNS V3R5 (1997), ITPENTER was enhanced to run as a TCP/IP for MVS application, thus sending the data traffic generated by its simulated terminals and/or programmed resources (clients) to the application(s) (servers) under test via the IBM TCP/IP V3R2 for MVS High Performance Native Sockets (HPNS) API, subsequently renamed 'the Macro API'. Retrieved on October 29, 2015. Retrieved on October 29, 2015. Test Manager With TPNS V3R5 (1998), IBM introduced the TPNS Test Manager which added substantial automation features that streamline many repetitive tasks associated with planning, preparing, operating and analyzing a TPNS-based simulation run, while still enabling the test programmer optionally to retain full awareness, in real-time, of the events unfolding at every step and to intervene if necessary. =Post-processing utilities= During the simulation, ITPENTER keeps a log (on tape or disk) of all messages exchanged between the simulated device(s) and the real application(s) under test. After the simulation has completed, the test programmer can therefore run any of three TPNS-supplied log analysis utilities. Log list (ITPLL) The log list utility (ITPLL) is used to list and review the data exchanges in detail. Response time calculator (ITPRESP) The response time calculator (ITPRESP) is used to calculate and print response times reports. Log compare (ITPCOMP) The log compare utility (ITPCOMP) is used to compare the 3270 screen images logged during two simulation runs of the same script(s) and report on differences between them. =Additional facilities= The Echo program (ITPECHO) The Echo program (ITPECHO) is supplied with TPNS (and WSim) as a ready-made VTAM application that runs in the system under test as a target for messages sent by real or simulated 3270 display device(s). Using ITPECHO enables network connectivity and load testing to be carried out without the need to set up a copy of a production-level application and its databases, thereby saving test personnel the effort of writing scripts or allocating disk space for such an application and its datasets. As its name implies, ITPECHO will return exactly the message it has just received (when sent with the 'Enter' key), but it can also return the amount of data that was requested in the previous message (when sent with the 'PF5' key), from real or simulated display device(s). The latter feature is useful for creating test conditions where the 'send' and 'receive' messages need to be of different and variable lengths. To provide the amount of data requested, ITPECHO pads its message with as many occurrences of the alphabet as necessary, or a fraction of it if the amount of data requested in less than 26 characters. The AVailability MONitor (AVMON) facility Rather than applying TPNS as a test tool, AVMON (AVailability MONitor) is a TPNS implementation designed to monitor the availability and performance of real network subsystems running in production (NetView and TSO). The TPNS-supplied sample AVMON scripts monitor only NetView and TSO, but a user installation may add support for monitoring more subsystems (CICS, IMS, DB2, etc.) and any of their applications, by modifying or extending the AVMON scripts, perhaps through the use of the Interactive Data Capture script generator mentioned above to create the new script(s). During the TPNS simulation run, AVMON updates the TPNS log dataset, which can therefore be processed by the three TPNS log analysis utilities (log list, response times calculator and log compare). AVMON monitors availability by simulating a single terminal user in session with a real subsystem, periodically sending a brief probing message, and sensing when the subsystem becomes unavailable. When the simulated user detects unavailability, it sends a message to the operator console alerting the operator to the problem. AVMON also tracks the time it takes for the monitored subsystem to return a response, and reports whenever a user- specified performance threshold is exceeded. By using the TPNS Response Time utility, the performance statistics of the entire monitoring run can be compiled into a single report, thus providing an installation with evidence of the end-to-end response times experienced by the subsystem's end-users. For automated operations, AVMON may also be modified to perform operator functions when it senses that a real resource has become inoperative and therefore requires an operator intervention, such as restarting the resource for example.

It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas.Regi√£o Metropolitana de Campinas It lies about northwest of the State capital. It occupies an area of , of which is urban. In 2010, the population was estimated at 180,148 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, making it the 43rd most populous city in S√£o Paulo and the sixth largest in the metropolitan region of Campinas. Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste has an annual average temperature of , and the original vegetation of the area predominates. The city has an urbanization rate of 98.73%. As of 2009, there were 44 medical institutions in the city, and its human development index (HDI) is rated as 0.819 in relation to the rest of the state. Founded on 4 December 1818, when the Church was built, the city was named in honor of its patron saint, Santa Barbara, it was originally part of Piracicaba. It separated from Piracicaba in 1900. Since Margaret Grace Martins donated the land for the construction of the townsite, she is considered the founder, making the city the first and only Brazilian city founded by a woman. The city is also the birthplace of the automobile industry in Brazil, being where the first car was produced in Brazil. Today, Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste is subdivided into slightly more than 130 districts. Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste has an important cultural tradition, ranging from craft and theater, to music and sports. American immigration has brought various influences on both cultural and tourist events and attractions, including the Party of Immigration, and the Fair of Nations. In the midst of the city is a cemetery, best known as the Graveyard of the Americans. It is administered by the Fraternity of American Descendants, who regularly hold meetings and events aimed at preserving the traditions and customs of American immigrants.] History =Origins= Until around 1810, the area where the city of Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste now stands was virgin forest. That year, a road was constructed, linking the parish of Santo Ant√¥nio de Piracicaba to Villa de San Carlos de Campinas. With these improvements, the area turned into a good agricultural region due to its plentiful water sources, leading to the region being broken into allotments and put up for sale. Margaret Grace Martins, widow of sergeant major Francisco de Paula Martins, bought one of those allotments, measuring two leagues square, whose boundaries were the Piracicaba river to the north and by Quilombo Creek to the northeast. On the site, she founded a sugar plantation, putting her son, Captain Manoel Francisco Grace Martins, in charge of administering the property. In 1818, she initiated the formation of a settlement and the construction of a chapel, dedicated to Saint Barbara. Martins donated the lands the city would develop on, making the town the first and only Brazilian city founded by a woman. The chapel was dedicated on 4 December 1818, now considered to be the date of the town's founding. As the area was settled, other farmers settled in and around the city. On 16 April 1839, the municipality rose to the position of Capela Curada de Santa B√°rbara of Toledos (the name \\"Toledos\\" was added in reference to the stream that crossed the city, named Ribeirao of Toledos), and became the Fourth District of Vila Nova da Constitui√ß√£o (now the city of Piracicaba). Years later, the district of Santa Barbara was created by Provincial Law Number 9, on 18 February 1842, in addition, the chapel was elevated from a capela curada, an official title given by the Catholic Church, to a freguesia. It was then transferred on 23 January 1844, to become part of the municipality of Campinas, followed by a further transfer, by Provincial Law Number 12 on 2 March 1846, back to the Municipality of Piracicaba. Finally, by Provincial Law No. 2, on 15 June 1869 the municipality of Santa Barbara was officially created, parting from Piracicaba. The Municipality has always been made up of a single district. The town was officially renamed Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste on 30 November 1944. =20th and 21st centuries= The sugar industry boomed in the late 19th century due to the increase in the demand for sugar. At the time, large sugar mills were constructed in the city, such as the Plant de Cillo Santa B√°rbara (now disabled). In the 1920s several industries emerged, including textiles and agricultural implements. Over the years, other industries moved into the area. Eventually, on 5 September 1956, the first Brazilian car, the Romi-Isetta, was released. During the 1960s and 1970s, with the rapid development of the nearby settlement of Americana, many people came looking for jobs and housing. Due to the close proximity of the two municipalities, the area between them was settled, creating a conurbation. Initially there was some confusion, since the boundaries of the two towns were not officially set. The problem was solved with the creation of the Avenida da Amizade, which cut through the region, fixing the boundary between the two towns. The population expansion not only brought development, but also problems to the region, since it drained public accounts. This precipitated years of economic stagnation. Since the 2000s, due to both public and private investment, the city is reaching an economic and social balance, becoming increasingly competitive in the metropolitan region of Campinas. Legal incentives for businesses that invest in the city were created, and the expansion of the Rodovia dos Bandeirantes, whose route passes through the municipality, has brought new opportunities for development. Today, Santa B√°rbara is one of the major economic forces in the metropolitan region of Campinas, with a good quality of life. The city has a strong industrial character, and is home to companies such as Romi, Usina Furlan, Goodyear, Canatiba, Mazak, and Denso. The city boasts good leisure facilities such as the Tivoli, which opened in November 1998, and is one of the main shopping malls and meeting points in the city with almost 700,000 visitors every month. It serves the population of Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste, Americana, Nova Odessa, Sumar√© and Hortol√¢ndia, as well as the regions of Piracicaba and Limeira. American immigration After the end of the American Civil War, beginning in 1867, the region began to see immigration from the southern United States, these immigrants were known as the Confederados. Along with their customs and cultures, the Americans brought new agricultural methods and techniques, contributing greatly to the advancement of agriculture in the region. The Americans also brought new religions into Brazil, and on 10 September 1871 the first Brazilian Baptist Church was established in Santa B√°rbara. The first Americans to arrive in the city were Colonel William Hutchinson Norris, a Civil War veteran and former Senator from the State of Alabama, and his son, who began to teach courses on cotton cultivation techniques to local farmers. Once they were established, they sent for the rest of their family, as well as other countrymen. American immigration was crucial to one of the main cultural events of the city: the annual meeting of the Fraternity of American Descendants. Many immigrants who came to Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste achieved national prominence, such as P√©rola Byington, a philanthropist and social activist born in the city. =Descendants of the immigrants= Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste received an influx of immigrants from the Confederate States of America in the late 1860s (known as Confederados) The first generation of Confederados remained an insular community, but by the third generation, most of the families had intermarried with native Brazilians or immigrants of other origins. As time went on, these descendants of the Confederados increasingly spoke the Portuguese language and identified themselves as Brazilians. As the area around Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste and Americana turned increasingly to the production of sugar cane and the society became more mobile, the Confederados tended to migrate to cities. Today, only a few families still live on the original land owned by their ancestors. While the descendants of the original Confederados are scattered throughout Brazil, they maintain the headquarters of their descendant organization in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste. Today's Confederados maintain affection for the Confederate flag even though they consider themselves completely Brazilian. In Brazil, the Confederate flag does not have the historical association with slavery nor the corresponding stigma that exists in the United States. Many modern Confederados are of mixed-race and reflect the varied racial categories that make up Brazilian society in their physical appearance. Recently the Brazilian residents of Americana, now of primarily Italian descent, have removed the Confederate flag from the city's crest citing the fact that Confederados now make up only 10% of the city's population. In 1972, then Governor (and future President) Jimmy Carter of Georgia visited the city of Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste and visited the grave of his wife Rosalynn's great-uncle, who was one of the original Confederados. =Culture= Descendants of Americans during Confederado Festival in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste. The center of Confederado culture is the Campo Cemetery, known as the Cemetery of the Americans, in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste, where most of the original Confederados from the region are buried. Most of the Confederados were Protestant, and the only cemetery in town was the Catholic cemetery, where it was forbidden to bury non-Catholics. In 1867, with the death of Beatrice Oliver, wife of Colonel Oliver, he buried her (as he later buried his daughters) on a plot of land on his property. He earmarked an acre of his land so that American families could bury their dead. This became the Cemetery of the Americans. Today about 500 people are buried in the cemetery.The chapel of Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste The descendants still foster a connection with their history through the Fraternity of American Descendants, an organization dedicated to preserving the unique mixed culture. In April, the organization holds an annual festival, called the Festa Confederada in order to fund the Campo Cemetery. The festival is based on the culture of the old American south of the antebellum period. During the event there are typical American foods such as chicken fingers, burgers and baked corn; bands play jazz, dixieland, and traditional American folk songs, Confederate flags are everywhere. American folk dances, specifically square dances, are the highlight of the event. Women dress the part, much like the character Scarlett O'Hara in the film Gone with the Wind, and men in Confederate uniforms, boots and hats. The cemetery has a recreation area where the fraternity holds its quarterly meetings, as well as the Festa Confederada. The festival receives visitors from various parts of Brazil and the world; in 2006 the party attracted 1500 people, and has received such distinguished visitors as Georgia Governor (later US President) Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalyn, as well as representatives of the US Consulate and press agencies of the United States. The Confederado community established a Museum of Immigration in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste preserving the history of Brazilian immigration and its benefits to the nation. Sports The main football club of the city is the Uni√£o Barbarense, founded on 22 November 1914. They currently compete in the A1 series of the Campeonato Paulista. Their home stadium is \\"Stadium Antonio Lins Ribeiro Guimar√£es\\" with a capacity of 14,914. The record-setting swimmer C√©sar Cielo was born in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste. The Esporte Clube Barbarense has a swimming team which has done well in competitions throughout the State of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. The barbarense swimmer, C√©sar Cielo Filho, who started his career in this club, received international recognition when he won three gold medals and one silver medal at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro; he would go on to win the first gold medal by a Brazilian swimmer during the 2008 Summer Olympics. In September 2010 the Esporte Clube Barbarense hosted one of the most important competitions of Brazil's sports calendar: the Jose Finkel Trophy swim. This served as the Brazilian tryouts for the FINA World Swimming Championships of 2010, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In 2010, the municipal administration of Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste began construction of the Polo C√©sar Cielo. Following international standards, the first Olympic- size swimming pool in the region will be 50 x 25 meters with a depth of 2.5 meters. R$3.3 million was invested in the project, with funds provided by the Ministry of Sports and city itself. The total area of the water polo facility will be 3.6 million square feet, including bleachers, locker and training rooms.

Also known as \\"Hemlock\\", Stabler is a small unincorporated community in the southernmost region of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Stabler is primarily a bedroom community for commuters working in nearby Carson, Stevenson, and other towns in the Columbia River Gorge. Stabler is also home to the Wind River Experimental Forest, and the Wind River Ranger Station, a base of operations for the USFS. History The 26' Hemlock Lake dam was built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to provide water for hydroelectric power generation, and was modified in 1958 to provide irrigation water to the Wind River Tree Nursery. The hydropower was terminated in the 1950s, and the diversion that used to supply the nursery is not currently in use. The Wind River Tree Nursery was closed in 1997 and the dam is no longer used to divert water. It was the first in the Columbia basin to incorporate the use of a fish ladder. The dam was torn out in the summer of 2009 amid much debate with the idea that the removal of Hemlock Dam and restoration of lower Trout Creek would contribute to this whole watershed approach to habitat restoration, and is the culmination of many years of planning.

History Vandoren was founded in 1905 by Eug√®ne Van Doren (1873-1940), a clarinetist for the Paris Opera. The original location was eventually moved to 56 Rue Lepic, Paris where his son, Robert Van Doren (1904-1996), took over the business around 1935 and designed the 5RV mouthpiece In 1967, Bernard Van Doren (b. 1945), grandson of Eugene, took over the company and designed the B45 clarinet mouthpiece. Bernard also introduced new machinery to the company, and moved the factory to its current location in Paris at Bormes les Mimosas in 1990.http://www.vandoren-en.com/Vandoren- since-1905_a687.html With the improvements in technology, Vandoren was able to increase production, becoming a major manufacturer of reeds and mouthpieces for woodwind instruments.http://www.markmillermusic.com/clarreeds.html Mouthpieces Vandoren clarinet and saxophone mouthpieces are made of vulcanised rubber called ebonite. Their V16 tenor saxophone mouthpieces are also available in a metal variant. Reeds The company produces clarinet reeds in a variety of styles for French, German and Austrian style clarinets. =French styled clarinet reeds= Traditional reeds (blue packaging) are the most widely played style of reed. They are available in strengths from 1.5 to 5. They are made with a .09 mm thickness at the tip and a thickness of 2.8 mm at the heel. Vandoren V.12 reeds are produced from the thicker cane that is used to make saxophone reeds. At the tip, V.12 reeds have a thickness of .10 mm and at the heel, they have a thickness of 3.15 mm. This is equal to .124 inches, which is where the name V.12 comes from. The V.12 reeds come in strengths from 2.5 to 5. These strengths do not correspond to those of Vandoren Traditional reeds (a strength 4 V.12 has a similar hardness to a strength 3.5 Traditional reed). The V12 reed produces a darker tone than the traditional reed. The 56 rue Lepic reeds (black packaging) are named after the address of the Vandoren central offices on 56 rue Lepic, Paris. They differ from the other two types of Vandoren reeds in that they come from the thickest cane. At the tip, 56 rue Lepic reeds have a thickness of .11 mm and at the heel, they have a thickness of 3.25 mm. They are very similar to German style reeds. V21 reeds were released from 2015. They combine the shape of a 56 rue Lepic reed with a V.12 profile =German styled clarinet reeds= The White Master is designed for German clarinet players, respectively. Their cut is calculated to suit the characteristics of the German system clarinet mouthpieces. Black Master reeds have a larger and thicker cut than White Master reeds. = Austrian styled clarinet reeds = The Black Master is designed for Austrian clarinet players, respectively. They are available in two different models. The Black Master reed is designed for Austrian mouthpieces. This cut can also suit the Boehm system mouthpieces. The Black Master Traditional reed is designed in the tradition of the Viennese School for very closed Austrian mouthpieces, with a long facing. =Saxophone reeds= Like clarinet reeds, Vandoren saxophone reeds come in a variety of styles. The most basic is the Traditional reed, which is very similar to the Traditional clarinet reed. The JAVA reed, available in filed and unfiled varieties, is for playing jazz: the filed JAVA Red cut is more flexible with a slightly stronger tonal body than the original (green, unfiled) JAVA cut. In 1993, Vandoren began producing V16 reeds, also for jazz, which have a thicker tip and a longer pallet than the JAVAs. The ZZ is also intended for jazz. Vandoren has released from 2009 the V12 for classical music which is modeled after the success of the Vandoren V12 reed for clarinet. Then from 2016 the V21 reeds, a versatile model for various styles of music.http://www.vandoren- en.com/file/187077/ Accessories Vandoren has a large range of accessories for clarinet and saxophone: these include ligatures, reed cases, cleaning swabs, mouthpiece cushions and cork grease, and even instrument harnesses and neck straps. Some other accessories include mouthpiece pouches, reed trimmers and reed resurfacers. Saxophone and Clarinet Ligatures Vandoren produces a wide range of ligatures for clarinet and saxophone players. They are made from materials such as metal, leather, and woven materials. These ligatures can be found for the Bb clarinet, Bass clarinet, Eb clarinet, and the Alto clarinet. The same materials are used for saxophonists and can be found for the soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone and baritone saxophone. Vandoren's Optimum, M/O, Klassik ligature, and the leather ligature are all available for the clarinet and saxophone families.

It is a development of the Cirrus SR20, with a larger wing, higher fuel capacity, and a more powerful, 310-horsepower (231 kW) engine. The SR22 series has been the world's best-selling general aviation (GA) airplane every year since 2003. With 6,149 units delivered from 2001‚Äì19, and in combination with the SR20, a total of 7,645, it is the most-produced GA aircraft of the 21st century, and is the single most-produced GA aircraft made from composite material, accounting for over 30% of the entire piston aircraft market. The Cirrus SR22 is equipped with a whole-plane emergency recovery parachute system: the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). This has contributed to its market success and has given it the nickname \\"the plane with the parachute\\". Design and development 2004 Cirrus SR22 G2 front view, showing how the doors open 2007 Cirrus SR22-G3 Turbo 2013-built Cirrus SR22 Gen 5 The SR22, certified in November 2000, is a more powerful version of the earlier SR20. The SR22 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of composite construction, featuring fixed (non- retractable) tricycle landing gear with a castering nose wheel and steering via differential braking on the main wheels. It is powered by a nose-mounted 310 hp (231 kW) Continental IO-550-N piston engine. The four-seat cabin is accessed through doors on either side of the fuselage. The SR-series remains the only production airplane in its class to include side stick flight controls that combine aspects of a traditional yoke handle (referred to in the industry as a \\"side yoke\\"). The Cirrus SR22, like the SR20, is equipped with the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), which can lower the entire aircraft to the ground relatively gently in an emergency. In 2004, the company introduced the SR22 G2 (Generation 2) and in 2007 the SR22 G3 (Generation 3). Both were defined by airframe modifications, G2 by fuselage and G3 by modified wing and landing gear. Robert Goyer of Flying magazine wrote in a 2012 review that the Cirrus SR22 \\"is the most sophisticated single-engine civilian airplane ever built and by a long shot.\\" In 2013, the manufacturer introduced the SR22 G5 (Generation 5) (there was no G4). Key changes were an increase in gross weight to and a standard five-seat cabin arrangement. The G5 received only minor changes for 2014, including integrated LED lighting and Beringer brakes. In 2014, the SR22 and SR22T had been the best-selling four-to-five- seat fixed-wing aircraft in the world for 12 years in a row. In 2016, Cirrus introduced improvements to the SR Series, including Bluetooth wireless connectivity, a remote keyless entry, convenience lighting system, and an easy-access door latch. In 2017, the company introduced the SR22 G6 (Generation 6), with several major upgrades to the avionics and new navigation lighting. In September 2019, Cirrus unveiled the TRAC, a training-oriented version of the SR-series with a simplified interior, more durable seat material, backseat radio transmit switch to allow an observer to communicate with air traffic control, integrated engine indication and crew alerting/warning systems, and simulated retractable landing gear controls and position lights to allow cadets and instructors to feign landing gear operation and failures during instructional flights (the actual landing gear remains permanently fixed). In January 2020, the company introduced a new mobile app for the SR Series, called \\"Cirrus IQ\\", which enables remote aircraft communication including access to pre-flight status information like fuel and oxygen levels, battery voltage, oil temperature, aircraft location and flight hours. =Turbocharged models= Cirrus introduced the SR22 Turbo in 2006, with a Tornado Alley turbonormalizing upgrade kit that is factory installed under a Supplemental Type Certificate. It included twin turbonormalizers and twin intercoolers. The conversion includes built-in oxygen and a Hartzell three-blade (later four-blade as optional) lightweight composite propeller. The weight of the conversion reduces the SR22's useful load. Air conditioning is available with the SR22 Turbo, but this further reduces the useful load. The turbo version has a certified ceiling of , a maximum cruise speed of 211 knots (391 km/h), and a top speed of . In 2010, Cirrus introduced the SR22T. This used a new engine, the Continental TSIO-550K, which produces with a 7.5:1 compression ratio and can run on 94 octane fuel. =Glass cockpit= 2003‚Äì2008 era Cirrus instrument panel with the Avidyne Entegra PFD Post-2008 instrument panel with Cirrus Perspective avionics by Garmin SR22s and SR20s built before 2003 were equipped with traditional analog instruments and a 10\\" (later 12\\") Multi-function display (MFD). In February 2003, Cirrus began offering SR22s with the Avidyne Entegra primary flight display (PFD), making the plane the first of its kind to come with a glass cockpit. Later that year, this instrumentation became standard equipment on all SR-series aircraft and sparked a major transition in general aviation, whereby over 90% of all new light aircraft by the year 2006 were equipped with glass cockpits. Retrofits are available for the older SR aircraft that replace the analog instrument panels with one that includes a PFD, a new MFD and the installation of back-up mechanical instruments.Goyer, Robert: Avidyne Glass for Steam Gauge Cirrus Airplanes, Flying magazine February 2008, pp. 18‚Äì19. Hachette Filipacchi US Media On 22 May 2008, Cirrus revealed the \\"Cirrus Perspective\\" glass cockpit (by Garmin). Both cockpits were available for a while (the Avidyne cockpit was initially standard equipment) and after 2008 the SR22 was sold with only the Perspective panel. In 2009, the third-generation Cirrus SR22 GTS came equipped with a new enhanced vision system (EVS), a sophisticated dual-wavelength instrument that offers both infrared and synthetic vision. At the 2010 EAA AirVenture, Cirrus announced its plans to certify Garmin's ESP system (Electronic Stability and Protection) on the Cirrus SR22. It included advanced flight envelope protection that could stabilize the aircraft with the push of a button, to avoid spiral from developing. The Cirrus Perspective-Plus avionics flight deck was introduced in 2017, with a faster processing speed, animated datalink weather, payload management, visual approach capabilities, wireless database uploads, glass back-up instruments, and more. In 2020, the Perspective-Plus flight deck included a new stabilized approach advisory system which provides alerts to the pilot of unstable conditions during approach. =Flight into known icing= Cirrus completed testing for flight into known icing conditions (FIKI) on 12 January 2009. The equipment change involved installing a larger fluid tank for the TKS Ice Protection System and protecting more areas of the aircraft. The FAA approved the new installation in April 2009. Operational history Ryan Campbell departing OSH on record attempt in 2013 Australian pilot Ryan Campbell used an SR22 to become the youngest pilot to fly solo around the world (a title which he held for nearly a year), at age nineteen. He completed his trip on 7 September 2013 in Wollongong. His SR22, Spirit of the Sapphire Coast, was modified by removing three seats and adding a fuselage tank for a total of usable. As of September 2018, the SR-series has deployed the parachute system 79 times carrying 163 survivors. Variants Original version SR22 2006 Turbo Charged model ;SR22 :Original version ;SR22 G2 :Improved variant ;SR22 Turbo G2 :In July 2006, Cirrus announced a turbo normalized SR22. Some initial limited models were identified as Signature Edition SE22 G2s‚Äîequipped with additional features including an unequally painted exterior, black leather seats, and the signatures of Cirrus founders Dale and Alan Klapmeier on the cowling. ;SR22TN :Version with a Tornado Alley turbo-normalizing kit added to the Continental IO-550-N engine producing . ;SR22 G3 :Launched in 2007, the SR22 G3 variant has increased fuel capacity from , a lighter stronger carbon fiber wing spar and longer landing gear for increased prop clearance. Upgraded models, such as the GTS, come with airbag seatbelts. SR22T landing ;SR22T :Introduced in June 2010, with a turbocharged Continental TSIO-550-K producing . The engine has low-compression pistons, producing a 7.5 to 1 compression ratio to allow the engine to run on lower octane fuel, 94UL. The SR22T has a maximum cruise speed of , empty weight of , and a maximum operating altitude of . This model also has a decreased useful load of and reduced range of , as well as a Hartzell three-blade lightweight composite prop. ;SR22/22T G5 :On 17 January 2013 Cirrus Aircraft announced the fourth generation of the SR22 and SR22T (skipping G4 as a designation for the new version of the aircraft). Features included a increase in the maximum takeoff weight, and some previous options‚Äî60/40 split back seat, ADS-B transponder, and Garmin GFC700 autopilot‚Äîbecame standard equipment. The wheel pants were redesigned and included an access door for the inflator valve. Cirrus improved the aircraft's ballistic parachute using a larger canopy to account for the higher takeoff weight, and a more powerful rocket. The rocket firing changed to a fail-safe electronic ignition, with a maximum operating speed of 140 knots (up from 133 knots). Earlier versions used a pyrotechnic rocket ignition system. Maximum flap speeds were increased to 150 knots (first notch); 110 knots (second notch); and added another 3.5 degrees of extension. Fuel burn slightly increased at cruise speeds, rate of climb was reduced, liftoff speed increased to 80 knots (from 72 knots), and stall speed increased to 60 knots (from 58 knots). ;SR22/22T G6 :Introduced in January 2017, the G6 model adds new LED wingtip lights and an updated Garmin avionics flight deck (known as \\"Cirrus Perspective-Plus\\") with a 10-times faster instrument processing speed and several other upgrades. ;TRAC :Introduced in September 2019, the TRAC is a flight-training version SR22/22T with a simplified, more durable interior, Perspective+ flight deck, rear seat push-to-talk functionality, and simulated landing gear controls. Operators ImagineAir Cirrus SR22 The aircraft is used by flying schools, air charter and small air taxi carriers as well as private individuals and companies. For several years, the largest fleet was operated by ImagineAir, which was in operation from 2007‚Äì2018. Previously to this, the largest fleet‚Äî26 aircraft‚Äîhad been operated by SATSair, which began operations in 2004 and went out of business in 2009. The largest European operator of the Cirrus SR22 is Fly Aeolus, a Belgian fractional ownership company established in 2009 that operates 13 SR22s. The French Air Force uses six SR22s as training aircraft, and the Royal Saudi Air Force acquired 25 SR22s in 2013, replacing Cessna 172s as primary trainers at the King Faisal Air Academy. In 2015 Emirates purchased 22 aircraft for training purposes. The Minnesota State Patrol uses a special missions \\"Cirrus Perception\\" SR22 for law enforcement operations, surveillance, search and rescue missions and more. Accidents and incidents Between 2001 and May 2014, 147 US-registered Cirrus SR22 aircraft crashed, resulting in 122 fatalities. Nb.-Make=Cirrus, Model=SR22, Registration=\\"N\\" (US only) In 2011, the accident record of the SR20/SR22 was examined by Aviation Consumer magazine. It found that the series' overall accident record is better than average for light aircraft, exceeded only by the Diamond DA40 and DA42. However its fatal accident rate is worse, at 1.6 per 100,000 flight hours‚Äîwhich places it higher than the United States general aviation rate of 1.2, and higher than the Diamond DA40 (0.35), Cessna 172 (0.45), Diamond DA42 (0.54), Cessna 182 (0.69), and the Cessna 400 (1.0), despite the SR22's full aircraft parachute system. By the end of 2013, the accident rate had been reduced to a fatality rate of 1.01 per 100,000 flight hours. This was attributed to better training, particularly in use of the ballistic parachute system. The accident rate continued to decrease in 2014, with a fatal rate of .42 per 100,000 flight hours, one of the industry's lowest. This marked the fewest fatalities in a single year for Cirrus since 2001, and the first year where the number of CAPS deployments (12) exceeded the number of fatal accidents (3).

Using a shield allows for feeding to progress until the baby's suction draws out the nipple. * Small, weak or sick babies often have difficulty latching on to the breast. A nipple shield makes latching easier and prevents the baby becoming discouraged. * Babies who had to be bottle-fed since birth can become used to the bottle teat. Nipple shields feel more like teats, and aid with the transition to breast feeding. * A mother's nipples can become sore or cracked from breastfeeding. A shield allows the mother to continue breastfeeding until her cracked nipples heal and she improves her latching technique. * They make it easier to measure the quantity of milk consumed. Most doctors and lactation consultants stress that nipple shields use should be temporary; the aim is always to return to regular breastfeeding, unless otherwise indicated. Breast shells may be confused with nipple shields, but shields are intended for use during the act of breastfeeding, whereas breast shells are worn in preparation for breastfeeding. History Sterling silver, ivory, and glass nipple shields. Older nipple shields were made of latex and harder, thicker plastics, and often caused more problems than they solved. A 17th-century nipple shield held in Shakespeare's birthplace is made of pewter. Before the invention of plastics, nipple shields were made of metal, glass, or ivory.
