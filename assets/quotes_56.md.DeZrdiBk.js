The film is centered on former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo and both his playing days and his battle against diabetes. The film was written, co-produced, and directed by Santo's son Jeff. It is often mentioned during Cub game broadcasts by Pat Hughes, who was Santo's partner in the WGN Radio booth. The film was a gift from Jeff to his father as a part of the \\"Ron Santo Day\\" celebration that season after Santo had both his legs amputated and had just missed induction into the MLB Hall of Fame a few months earlier. A portion of all proceeds from the release of This Old Cub are donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The film has raised over a half-million dollars for the JDRF. Cub first baseman Ernie Banks, Gary Sinise, Bill Murray, former Chicago Bears linebacker Doug Buffone, and many others are interviewed in the film, which is narrated by actor Joe Mantegna. The documentary inspired an Arizona teacher and lifelong Cub fan named Bill Holden to engage a 2100-mile walk from Arizona to Wrigley Field to raise funds for the JDRF. Holden covered at least 12 miles each day, crossed six states, and battled his arthritis during the nearly seven-month trek. Followed by the media, Holden arrived at Wrigley on July 1, 2005 where he threw out the first pitch and joined Santo in singing \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\". The venture raised over $250,000 for the charity, and caused a dramatic spike in sales of the DVD. Derek Schaul, the leader of Chicago Cubs Bleacher Bums, wears a shirt to every game stating, \\"I walk for the cure because Ronnie can't! Go Cubbies!\\" This Old Cub was co-produced by Walgreens Drug Stores and the Chicago Tribune, both heavy sponsors of the JDRF.

The right-handed pitcher, born in Guanabacoa near Havana, appeared in five games in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers in during his 13-year pro career. He stood tall and weighed . Vald√©s was acquired by Brooklyn in 1954 after spending his first two seasons in the minor leagues with the unaffiliated Indios de Ciudad Ju√°rez of the Class C Arizona‚ÄìTexas League, winning 19 games during each year. Primarily a starting pitcher, he was a prolific winner during his minor league tenure, reaching double digits in victories for ten consecutive seasons (1952‚Äì1961).Baseball Reference: Minor league and Mexican League statistics He posted an 18‚Äì4 mark in the Class C California League in 1954. Then, two years later, Vald√©s led the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League in games won, with 22 triumphs. In 1957, Vald√©s worked in four early-season games for the Brooklyn Dodgers. In his d√©but April 21 at Ebbets Field, he held the Pittsburgh Pirates without a hit over 3 innings pitched in relief of Dodger ace Don Newcombe.Retrosheet box score: 1957-04-21 (1) Three days later, against the New York Giants, he entered the game in the fifth inning in relief of starter Sandy Koufax and allowed three hits and one earned run in three full innings to get credit for a 4‚Äì3 Dodger victory.Retrosheet box score: 1957-04-24 Two poor outings followed, resulting in Vald√©s' demotion to the Triple-A Montreal Royals, where he won 11 games and posted a 2.87 earned run average. He was recalled in September and started what would be the Brooklyn Dodgers' penultimate game, on the 28th against the Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium. He did not earn a decision when he exited the game in the fifth inning, even though he held an 8‚Äì3 lead at the time.Retrosheet box score: 1957-09-28 After the Dodgers' season-ending game the next day, the franchise transferred to Los Angeles for the 1958 campaign. As a major leaguer, Vald√©s split two decisions; he allowed 13 hits, seven bases on balls and eight earned runs in 13 full innings of work, with ten strikeouts, posting an earned run average of 5.54. He toiled at the Triple-A level in the Dodger organization from 1958 through 1961, then finished his career with three seasons in the Mexican League. He died in Miami, Florida, at age 78 in 2008.

In Arabidopsis thaliana AP2 plays a role in the ABC model of flower development. It was originally thought that this family of proteins was plant-specific; however, recent studies have shown that apicomplexans, including the causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum encode a related set of transcription factors, called the ApiAP2 family. In the A. thaliana transcription factor RAV1 the N-terminal AP2 domain binds 5'-CAACA-3' sequence, while the C-terminal highly conserved B3 domain binds 5'-CACCTG-3' sequence.  Structure and Biological Content of AP2  Through recent studies, Apetala 2 is found to have a major role in hormone regulation, specific in flowers and plants, such as the AGAMOUS.Mutual Regulation of Arabidopsis thaliana Ethylene-responsive Element Binding Protein and a Plant Floral Homeotic Gene, APETALA2. Ogawa, T., Uchimiya, H., Kawai-Yamada, M. Ann. Bot. (2007) The study that determined this, done by Ogawa, was created to clarify the relationship between Apetala 2 and AtEBP in gene expression. The results showed that over-expression of AtEBP caused upregulation of AP2 expression in leaves which suggested that the N-terminal region is not required to produce AP2-like phenotypes.Functional domains of the floral regulator AGAMOUS: characterization of the DNA binding domain and analysis of dominant negative mutations. Mizukami, Y., Huang, H., Tudor, M., Hu, Y., Ma, H.

Klucher, K.M., Chow, H., Reiser, L., Fischer, R.L.

PhAP2A was found to have extremely similar functions of AP2 in A. thaliana and has an almost exact gene sequence. PhAP2B and PhAP2C encode for AP2-like proteins that belong to a different subgroup of the AP2 family of transcription factors and exhibit very different expression patterns during flower development compared to PhAP2A.Petunia Ap2-like genes and their role in flower and seed development.

History  Roman Wales was the farthest point west that the Roman Empire in Roman Britain extended to, and as a defence point the fortress at Isca Augusta, now Caerleon, built in 75 AD, was one of only three permanent Roman Legionary fortresses in Roman Britain. It was occupied and operational for just over 200 years. The National Roman Legion Museum lies inside what remains of the fortress, and contains many artefacts from the period of Isca Augusta of Legio II Augusta from Roman currency to uniforms. A short walk from the National Roman Legion Museum is the remains of Isca Augusta: * Part of the military bath house in the Roman Baths Museum * The most complete Roman amphitheatre in Britain * Sections of the fortress walls * The only remains of a Roman legionary barracks on view anywhere in Europe at Prysg Field  Museum  The original museum The museum is located in the centre of Roman Isca, on what was the via principalis leading to the amphitheatre. The first museum building was the Antiquarian Museum of 1850. This was built to a design by H.F Lockwood of Hull, a simple box-shaped building of Bath stone. Its only architectural feature of note was the pillared portico in the Greek Doric style. Little is known of the original building but it is known to have re- used ship's timbers in its roof and stone details from the Old Market House of Caerleon which had been demolished shortly before. It is often claimed that the timbers are from , although this ship was in service at the time and had no obvious connection to Newport. The museum building was Grade II listed in 1951, but was largely demolished during the 1987 rebuilding and enlargement of the museum. Only the portico now remains. The new building is in a modernist style, but equally featureless and windowless as the original. As of February 2019, the site is being redeveloped and is closed to the public until autumn 2019. It will continue to offer facilities for local schools. upright See also *Newport Museum *Venta Silurum References External links *Official website - National Roman Legion Museum *Six pages of artifacts held within the museum and relating to Roman Caerleon at Gathering the Jewels Category:National museums of Wales Category:Culture in Newport, Wales Category:History of Newport, Wales Category:Organisations based in Newport, Wales Category:Museums in Newport, Wales Category:Landmarks in Newport, Wales Category:Museums of ancient Rome in Wales Category:Military and war museums in Wales Category:Archaeological museums in Wales Category:Caerleon Category:Grade II listed buildings in Newport, Wales ","title":"National Roman Legion Museum"},{"id":"13095942","text":"Erskine Nicol (3 July 1825 ‚Äì 1904) was a Scottish figure and genre painter.

He was a pioneer of 4-H youth development, a director of the Alabama Extension Service (now Alabama Cooperative Extension System) and president of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University).Smith, Jack D., \\"Information and Inspiration: An Early History of the Alabama Cooperative Extension Service\\", (Unpublished Manuscript Prepared for Alabama Extension's 75th Anniversary), March 29, 1989. Early life Duncan was born near Russellville in the northwest Alabama county of Franklin. In 1896, he enrolled at Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in Auburn, Alabama, where he eventually emerged as a student leader. To support his college career, he taught during the summer at a rural school near his home for $25 a month. Following graduation, Duncan returned to his native northwest Alabama to teach for a short time in a rural county school before taking an instructor's job at an agricultural school in Wetumpka in east Alabama. He held several other teaching jobs in various parts of Alabama before returning to Auburn to work as an instructor and research worker under the direction of famed agricultural scientist and researcher J.F. Duggar. Exposure to Extension Work Duncan's work with API took him to almost every county in Alabama. His work with farmer institutes and similar types of efforts strengthened his knowledge of an informal type of educational outreach that eventually became known as Cooperative Extension work. He was especially influenced by the work of Seaman A. Knapp, an early Extension educational pioneer. During this early stage of his career, he also completed his master's degree at API in 1907. Duncan eventually was appointed a professor of Extension in API's school of agriculture, jointly employed by API and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and charged with serving as a \\"demonstration expert\\". His work involved organizing demonstrations at schools and other agriculture-related venues to encourage youth and adults alike to adopt cutting-edge agricultural practices pioneered at API and other land- grant universities throughout the nation. In this position, Duncan played an instrumental role organizing boys (or corn) clubs through the state ‚Äî a movement that eventually would be combined with girls clubs to form what later became known as 4-H. By 1909, the state had more than 2,000 corn club members. By 1911, the number had grown to 10,000 members.Yeager, Joseph and Stevenson, Gene, \\"Inside Ag Hill: The People and Events That Shaped Auburn's Agricultural History from 1872 through 1999\\", Chelsea, Michigan: Sheridan Books, 1999. Duncan also played a major role in educational efforts aimed at diversifying Alabama agriculture, promoting hog and poultry production in addition to raising cotton, peanuts and tomatoes. By 1915, following of the Smith-Lever Act, which formally established Cooperative Extension work in Alabama and the rest of the nation, Duncan was serving as superintendent of Junior and Home Economics Extension in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Meanwhile, Duggar, Duncan's mentor, assumed the directorship of the newly organized Alabama Extension Service. The dual units persisted until Duncan assumed leadership of the Alabama Extension Service in 1920.Yeager and Stevenson, p. 80. Alabama Extension Service Director Duncan Hall, the Auburn University headquarters of the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, is named after Duncan. Also, in honor of Duncan, the building was constructed with limestone from Duncan's native Franklin County.Along with Duggar's initial efforts, Duncan was instrumental in laying the groundwork for Cooperative Extension work in Alabama, ensuring the transition of the Extension mission from a primarily USDA-driven effort to one in which API, the state's first land-grant university, held primary responsibility. Much of the Alabama Extension Service's initial efforts were focused on dealing with the bleak economic conditions associated with farming at the time. Part of this involved developing a staff of specialists with statewide responsibilities and trained to provide agents in the field with up-to-date, research-based information from the land-grant university system. Duncan also oversaw efforts to adopt new forms of technological delivery, including the purchase of a 1,000-watt radio station to broadcast educational information to the state's farm population. Duncan is remembered as an Extension administrator who demanded near perfection from his employees. He expected them not only to display a level of maturity \\"in order to secure and maintain the confidence and respect of farm people\\" but also to possess \\"unbounded energy, zeal, optimism, enthusiasm and persistency\\" ‚Äî habits that should reflect \\"the very highest character\\". \\"A man entering upon his duties of the day without a shave or with a dirty collar‚Ä¶will never get very far with what he represents\\", Duncan once said.Yeager and Stevenson, pp. 90-91. The Farm Bureau Controversy Duncan was roundly criticized for his organization's close association with the Farm Bureau ‚Äî an issue that would hound him throughout his API career. From Extension's inception, agents worked with a wide array of agencies and other organizations associated with farming. But the relationship with the Farm Bureau, which was organized on the API campus at Duncan's behest in 1921, was unique. From the beginning, Cooperative Extension work was widely considered a success in providing research-based information to the state's farmers. But much of this progress was stymied by the lack of a cooperative farm marketing mechanism ‚Äî the reason for the organization of a nationwide network of Farm Bureaus. Critics maintained that Duncan favored the Farm Bureau over other farm organizations and even dictated Farm Bureau policy ‚Äî a charge Duncan repeatedly denied. In his defense, Duncan's actions reflected to a large degree those of the USDA, which had generally supported a close working relationship with Farm Bureau. Nevertheless, Duncan drew harsh criticism from USDA for acquiescing to the publication of a circular that instructed Alabama Extension agents about how to recruit Farm Bureau members and to collect their dues. The publication subsequently was withdrawn. Throughout the controversy, Duncan stuck to his guns, stressing that one of the original charges of the Extension Service was to advise farm organizations. He also contended that in supporting the Farm Bureau, he merely was assisting the farm organization with the best prospects for success. Duncan conceded that relations between Extension and Farm Bureau had been too close at times, such as when Extension agents collected dues on behalf of the Farm Bureau. But he stressed that these problems had been resolved. A subsequent investigation of the issue by API's board of trustees revealed no wrongdoing.Cox, Dwayne, \\"Cooperative Extension, the Farm Bureau, and Luther Duncan [videorecording: 1914-1947\\", (DVD) Auburn Sesquicentennial Lecture Series, Auburn University, 2006. President of Alabama Polytechnic Institute (later Auburn University) Duncan, who had developed a strong reputation for managing a statewide organization on a lean budget, was heavily favored by the state's business and professional interests to succeed Bradford Knapp as president of API. As far as many of them were concerned, this was precisely the kind of management style API needed in 1932, only three years after the onset of the Great Depression. Nevertheless, Duncan's past association with the Farm Bureau continued to draw withering criticism from Victor Hanson, an API trustee and Birmingham News publisher. Following a statewide newspaper campaign organized at Hanson's behest against Duncan, the API trustees, unable to reach agreement on Knapp's successor, appointed a three-man executive committee, which included Duncan, to manage the institute's affairs until final agreement could be reached on a permanent successor. Duncan's financial acumen, demonstrated time and again during this especially cash-strapped period of API's history, eventually won over a majority of API trustees. Duncan was installed as API president in 1935. Duncan is perhaps best remembered as a dogged fighter for what he considered to be API's fair share of state funding. While he remained a strong supporter of cooperation among Alabama's institutions of higher learning, he nonetheless stressed that this cooperation never should work to the detriment of API. Duncan Drive on the Auburn University campus is named after Duncan to honor his long service as Extension Service director and, later, president.For example, Duncan maintained that the prevailing interpretation of the state's Teacher-Training Equalization Fund greatly favored the University of Alabama at API's expense, even consigning API to second-class status. Working closely with Alabama Governor Bibb Graves, U.S. Senator John H. Bankhead and E.A. O'Neal, president of the American Farm Bureau, Duncan eventually secured passage of the Bankhead-Jones At, which increased funding for resident teaching, agricultural research and agricultural extension. Duncan also was a strong supporter of the equalization principle that each Alabama student should receive the same level of state support regardless of the institution attended. He also advocated a cooperative recruitment plan and the assignment of roles to Alabama and API so that would each could \\"render maximum service\\" in the areas it was best equipped to serve. Unfortunately for Duncan, stiff opposition at the time prevented much of this vision from being realized in his lifetime. Ironically, as he entered the twilight of his career, Duncan, however unwittingly, went to the mat once again over Extension's longstanding relationship with the Alabama Farm Bureau. Incoming populist Gov. James \\"Big Jim\\" Folsom, along with API trustee and Folsom supporter Gould Beech, maintained that agriculture had suffered a relative decline ‚Äî a problem, they claimed was due in large part to Alabama Extension ‚Äî and that Extension was still engaged in improper political activity with the Farm Bureau. Duncan, however, was unable to see this battle to the end, dying unexpectedly in the President's Mansion on July 26, 1947.Cox, Dwayne; Whitehead, Jeanne A; and Steward, Rodney J., \\"The Depression and World War II\\", The Auburn University Digital Library, Auburn University, Alabama. Legacy Even today, Duncan remains a somewhat controversial figure in Alabama history. He is best remembered for making the Alabama Extension Service and API driving forces on the Alabama political scene. He also is viewed by many as a visionary and reformer ‚Äî an early and vocal proponent of equitable funding for Alabama higher education, though one who never hesitated to secure what he considered to be API's fair share.

He conducted 101 bombing missions during the war, including the one that finally sank the German battleship Tirpitz in 1944. He succeeded Leonard Cheshire as commander of the famous 617 Squadron and, with six gallantry decorations to his name, remains one of the most distinguished airmen in the history of the nations of the British Commonwealth. Early career Tait was born in Manchester and educated at Wellingborough School. After visiting a Schneider Trophy event in 1928, he decided to join the RAF. He graduated from the RAF College Cranwell and was commissioned as a pilot officer in the RAF on 1 August 1936 and joined No. 51 Squadron RAF, flying Whitley bombers. He was promoted to flying officer on 1 February 1938. Second World War Tait was active on bombing operations with 51 Squadron in 1940, including several long- distance raids on Berlin and the first British air raid on Italy, crossing the Alps to bomb Turin, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 February 1940. By the end of the year, he was commanding 51 Squadron. On 10 February 1941, he led the aircraft involved in Operation Colossus flying from Malta to drop paratroops in southern Italy. For this mission, he was awarded the DSO. He was given a temporary promotion to squadron leader on 1 March 1941, which was later made substantive with the same seniority. After Colossus, Tait joined 35 Squadron, the first squadron to be equipped with Handley Page Halifaxes. He was awarded the first bar to his DSO for his exploits in leading a daylight raid on Kiel on 30 June 1941. He was mentioned in despatches in September 1941. Tait was rested from operations and posted to a training unit, but managed nevertheless to fly on the three \\"Thousand Bomber Raids\\" in early 1942. In mid-1942, Tait was appointed to command No. 78 Squadron RAF and was mentioned in despatches during his period in command. He was made a temporary wing commander on 1 June 1942. In March 1944, he became base operations commander at RAF Waddington where he continued to fly missions with RAAF Lancaster crews despite holding a non-flying job. He was given a substantive promotion to wing commander on 1 March 1944. He returned to operational duties in May 1944, becoming Master Bomber of 5 Group. His service in this role resulted in his being awarded a second bar to his DSO. He succeeded Leonard Cheshire as commander of No. 617 Squadron RAF in July 1944. 617 Squadron, the famous \\"Dambusters\\" squadron, specialised in low-level target marking and precision attacks. Under his command, the squadron bombed a series of V-1 storage sites and V-2 launching sites using Barnes Wallis's \\"Tallboy\\" 12,000 lb earthquake bomb. Tait was awarded a bar to his DFC for pressing home a low-level attack in a daylight raid on the Kembs Dam in southern Germany against fierce defensive fire despite having a damaged aircraft. Tirpitz in Norway, 1944 Tirpitz capsized in 1944. Wing Commander Willie Tait (left) and a RAAF officer standing on the wreck of Tirpitz in late 1945 On 15 September 1944, Tait led a force of 37 Avro Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron and 9 Squadron on Operation Paravane. Flying from an airfield at Yagodnik, near Arkhangelsk on the Kola Peninsula in northern Russia, they attacked the German battleship Tirpitz, in the Kaa Fjord. Despite smoke obscuring the target, the Tirpitz was so severely damaged the German High Command decided the ship could not be restored to seaworthiness. Tirpitz was therefore moved to Troms√∏ so its armament could be used as defensive artillery against an anticipated Allied invasion. The Germans were able to keep the ship's lack of seaworthiness a secret and so its destruction remained a high priority. Tait led his force in a second attack on 28 October named Operation Obviate, this time from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland (the ship's move having brought her within range). This raid was unsuccessful because of the heavy cloud obscuring the target shortly before the bombers arrived. On 12 November, Tait led his force against the Tirpitz for a third and final raid, Operation Catechism. The Luftwaffe failed to intercept the British bombers, and three direct hits by \\"Tallboy\\" bombs left the ship capsized west of Troms√∏, in the bay of H√•k√∏ybotn. In mid-December 1944, Tait, having completed 101 missions, was grounded and assigned to train Canadian bomber crews. Like his predecessor at No. 617 Squadron, he was recommended for the Victoria Cross for his \\"sustained gallantry\\" over almost five years of operations. However, unlike Cheshire, he was awarded the third bar to his DSO. The citation for this award, published in a supplement to the London Gazette in January 1945, reads: Post-war career Tait remained in the RAF after the war, initially reverting to the rank of squadron leader. He was re-promoted to wing commander in 1947 (back-dated to October 1946). He served in South East Asia, India, the Middle East, and Singapore. He commanded RAF Coningsby, was promoted to group captain in 1953, appointed Aide-de-camp to the Queen in 1959, and retired from the RAF in 1964.The Telegraph gives 1964; The Times says 1968 He retrained as a computer programmer, and joined ICL as a technical representative, working in Eastern Europe. After a period with a haulage company, he became an investment adviser with Scottish Widows. He finally retired in 1981. He married Betty Plummer in 1945. They had met during the war when she was an officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. She died in 1990.Telegraph obituary gives 1990; The Times 1995 Tait died on 31 August 2007; he was survived by his son and two daughters.

It was in operation as a passenger line from 1892 to 1963, and closed altogether in 1986. It took 46 years from conception to completion and was notable in that part of the line had to be practically rebuilt partway through its existence. Proposals for a line In 1849 the market town of Cheadle, population 3,000, was still without any form of rail transport. The North Staffordshire Railway had completed its Stoke to Derby line in 1848 and the Churnet Valley Line the following year but both of the lines missed the town, passing around to the south and north of Cheadle respectively. The people of the town, along with several mines on the Cheadle Coalfield, wanted a rail connection as a means of transporting their goods. Several schemes for a branch line were proposed over the years; among these was a branch from the NSR east of Blythe Bridge and running via Forsbrook to Dilhorne and then Cheadle. Unfortunately, none of the schemes ever came to fruition. In 1887, the Cheadle Railway, Mineral & Land Co. Ltd was formed and at long last construction of a branch line leaving the NSR line at Cresswell began the following year. In the meantime, the owners of Foxfield Colliery at Dilhorne had grown tired of waiting for the new line and had built their own connection to the NSR near Blythe Bridge. This line, running entirely over private land and opened in 1893 still survives today as the Foxfield Light Railway, albeit without the connection to the main line. Opening The first sod of the line was dug at Totmonslow on 22 March 1888. After several financial problems, the first stretch from Cresswell to Totmonslow was opened on 7 November 1892. The first train ran to Tunstall on the Potteries Loop Line and regular services became an extension of those on the latter for almost the whole of the branch's existence. Construction of the extension to Cheadle started in 1893. A new colliery, christened New Haden Colliery, was opened at Draycott and the line was already in operation for goods traffic up to this point. The new piece of line involved the building of a difficult tunnel. This passed through a ridge of high ground of sandstone before turning east and running to a station on the southern outskirts of Cheadle. The new section was also beset with financial problems and it was not until 1 January 1901 that the line opened in its entirety. In December 1906 Totmonslow station was renamed to Tean, although the village of Upper Tean was located a mile to the east. On 1 January 1907 the North Staffordshire Railway inherited the line from the Cheadle Railway Company; until that date they had provided the services but not actually owned the line. Construction of the diversion line Ordnance Survey map of the branch showing the original alignment c.1921 Ordnance Survey map showing both old and new lines, c.1949 Problems with the tunnel began almost immediately after completion. Several sections had to be patched up over the years but in November 1918, partial collapse caused the line to be closed for almost a month. While repairs were underway, the coal traffic was important enough to justify wagons being exchanged between locomotives while inside the tunnel, repairs being carried out by men working on a timber platform with just enough room for the wagons to pass underneath. After the NSR was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, problems with the tunnel became even more commonplace and construction of a new deviation line finally began in 1932. This skirted the high ground to the east and joined up with the old formation again just outside Cheadle station; this new alignment was opened in 1933. The tunnel portals were bricked up and the track from the south was lifted soon after, but the northern section of the old line remained in use as a backshunt to New Haden Colliery; all trains to and from the latter would thus need to reverse at Cheadle. The southern portal was used as a small private coal mine which operated from 1983 to 1991 and even though it is bricked much of the mining equipment remains inside the tunnel. By the beginning of World War II the passenger services had reduced to only two trains per day each way, with five on Saturday. In a further blow, New Haden Colliery was closed in 1943 after the Ministry of Fuel and Power decided to move the 500 miners to more efficient pits in aid of the war effort, and its traffic of 3,000 tons per week was lost. However, a brickworks adjacent to the colliery plus an increasing amount of sand traffic from nearby quarries, most of it delivered by road to Cheadle, provided a lifeline. Under British Railways As with many other railways in the county, passenger numbers were dwindling by the 1950s and some lines were closed but the Cheadle branch survived, albeit with only three passenger trains and one goods working each way on weekdays. Tean station closed under British Railways on 1 June 1953; by that time it had been reduced in status to an unstaffed halt. Diesel multiple units started to replace steam traction in 1958 when they were introduced on the Loop Line services, but this did little to stem the decline in passenger numbers. By the time of the Beeching Axe the passenger service was already slated for withdrawal, and the final passenger train on the line ran on Saturday 17 June 1963. The last working was the 5:07pm from Cheadle. Freight traffic from a nearby quarry continued to run until 1978 when the contract for the traffic expired. From then onwards, goods traffic was solely for railway civil engineering use, at the approximate rate of one train per month, usually hauled by Class 25 diesel locomotives but occasionally class 47's were used, and on a few occasions a class 40. The final train of Engineer's sand ran on November 3rd1984. After closure Overgrown track at the Cresswell end of the line After a gap of nearly 22 years, a passenger train ran to Cheadle on 28 March 1985 to mark the launch of the InterCity Charter Train Unit. The service included several Pullman vehicles and was hauled by a class 47 diesel number 47532. Passengers were taken by road to Alton Towers. The Cheadle branch was chosen by InterCity to show the versatility of the charter service by running on an out of use railway for part of the journey. A regular service to bring in the park's visitors by rail sadly never came to fruition and the line once again became redundant. The last train to Cheadle was a weedkilling train in the summer of 1986. The junction with the main Stoke to Derby line was severed in 1989, thus isolating the Cheadle branch from the national rail network. Today, most of the alignment is heavily overgrown but still free from development, except for the final quarter of a mile into Cheadle which was lifted in the summer of 1991 and early 1992 to make way for a new housing estate. The northern portal of the tunnel has been buried by opencast mining activity. In October 2011, Moorland & City Railways set up a company to look into the possibility of reopening the line. A lease has been taken from Network Rail and, in March 2012, overhanging trees were cut back and the remaining track was lifted after it emerged that of track had been stolen in the period up to Christmas 2011. The trackbed could be reused as a footpath/bridleway pending a decision on the future of the line. Since 2017, much of the line has found use as a footpath/bridleway, and some signs have been erected which give a brief history of the line including a few photographs of steam and diesel locomotives.

The company worked on highly available web infrastructures, publishing reports and studies on subjects such as Load Balancing and SSL Performance. It also added Jean- Fran√ßois Dumoulin as co-founder, and grew to roughly 15 employees. As part of its research, Networkshop developed a method for virtualizing the front-end infrastructure of web hosting systems. Working with a variety of firewall, load-balancer, switch, and cryptography vendors, the company deployed this shared infrastructure in a Montreal data center run by UUNET, and connected it to customers' servers within the same data center.  Coradiant founding  Coradiant's logo in 1999. In late 1999, Cary Goldwax and Thanos Moschopoulos joined the company and renamed it Coradiant. The name was a reflection of the shared duties of running highly available web infrastructure, literally, \\"brilliant together.\\" The company, backed by seed funding from Brett Helm, started fundraising in early 2000 to expand the shared infrastructure model to other cities. In late 2000, the company signed a US$20M Series A financing,Financial Post, Tuesday, November 7, 2000, \\"Coradiant's Global Plan Gets $US20M Boost\\" at the time the largest in Canadian history. The financing closed in early 2001. That year, the company also moved Canadian offices into larger space in Montreal's Windsor Station building.  OutSmart management service  The company's headquarters moved from Montreal to Boston, Massachusetts, but engineering and product development remained in Montreal. Coradiant's virtualized infrastructure, dubbed \\"OutSmart\\", was deployed in a variety of data centers in North America belonging to Colo.com, Internap, Sprint, and others, and the company opened offices in San Francisco, New York, and London, England. Mike Chuli joined the company as CEO in mid-2001.  OutSight monitoring service  Coradiant's OutSight logo. With the contraction of the dot-com and Application Service Provider sector, however, the financial advantages of shared infrastructure were no longer attractive; and Coradiant's OutSmart products could only be sold to tenants of data centers in which the virtual infrastructure was deployed. To address this, the company took its customer-facing management interface, known as OutSight, and made it available to customers who weren't in data centers in early 2002. OutSight measured web application health from three perspectives: the end user (by passively monitoring HTTP connections); SNMP GETs to infrastructure components; and synthetic testing. The company continued to sell OutSight as a standalone offering until early 2004, and reduced its staff substantially as it got out of the application management business.  Development of TrueSight  While OutSight was sold to customers successfully, it remained tethered to Coradiant's hosted management systems and was harder to sell to enterprises and security-sensitive buyers. As a result, in 2003 the company focused a core development team on a new, standalone product for measuring web performance. Called TrueSight, it was launched at Interop in 2004 and won the Best Of Show award. The company also won Best Of Show in 2005 for the introduction of the TrueSight TS-1100, the product's successor. The company later introduced a data warehouse appliance, called TrueSight BI, that let customers better analyze user performance data against specific dimensions such as servers, users, and pages.  Current day  Since that time, the company has continued to introduce products and technologies that measure end- user experience on web applications, letting IT organizations quickly find and fix web performance problems. A June 2007 Forrester Research \\"Wave\\" report rated Coradiant as a leader in the Web application performance analysis subsegment and stated that \\"Coradiant‚Äôs End User Experience Monitoring Solution Shines In Web Application Analysis.\\" Garbani, Jean-Pierre; Mendel, Thomas Ph.D.; Iqbal, Reedwan, \\"Coradiant‚Äôs End User Experience Monitoring Solution Shines In Web Application Analysis\\" Forrester Research, Inc., June 21, 2007. In 2008, Coradiant announced a partnership with Akamai Technology to measure customer experience for users of Akamai's application delivery network. Earlier that year, the company introduced a machine learning system (dubbed \\"TrueSight AIM\\") that applied statistical methods to web traffic in order to identify and diagnose anomalies. In 2009, Coradiant acquired Symphoniq Corporation, a maker of tools to track web transactions from end users. In April 2011, Coradiant Inc. was acquired by BMC Software for total cash consideration of $130 million.http://investors.bmc.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=950123-11-69055  See also  * BMC Software * Compuware * Tealeaf * Quest Software * Hewlett- Packard * Computer Associates References Category:Software companies established in 2000 Category:Companies based in San Diego Category:Software companies based in California Category:2011 mergers and acquisitions Category:Software companies of the United States ","title":"Coradiant"},{"id":"13096036","text":" √Ülfgar was a medieval Bishop of Elmham. √Ülfgar was consecrated in 1001 and resigned the see between 1012 and 1016.

The Manipur Government officially recorded the name as Singhat, that's because the Meiteis find it difficult to pronounce the original name. Singngat, a beautiful hilly village, skirted by sprawling plains below, has a very pleasant climate. Second to none when it comes to matters of awareness and progress, self-esteem and valour and the birthplace of many a great folklore, which will be always cherished and remembered, that in short is Singngat. It is the birthplace and humble beginnings of prominent businessmen, academicians, officers, artisans, writers, singers and songwriters, musicians, comedians, sportsmen and others who have excelled in their varied achievements. It is with great pleasure to recollect that it has an educational institution that has been recognised for its excellence even at the state level and was also a proud owner of a movie theatre at one point of time. The many great singers and their music albums it has produced, the books, novels, journals and articles it has churned out, and a very enlightening documentary and a couple of motion pictures it brought out, and the famous 'Singngat Special' tea has greatly enhanced the value of its 'Soft Power'. These are its identity which will live on for posterity. Geography It is a tiny border town between the international boundary of India and Myanmar. It is connected by road to the Burmese town of Tedim. Singngat is about 32 km from the district headquarters, i.e., Lamka and around 115 km from Sinzawl village bordering Mizoram. Behiang, a thriving trade center on the Indo-Myanmar border is 25 km away from Singngat. Singngat stands at a perfect geographical position; Tedim Road, stretches from Imphal, the state capital of Manipur, Lamka, passes through Singngat and enters Behiang which extends further down till Tedim Township in Myanmar; and Guite Road starts from Singngat and passes through Sinzawl village which finally makes its way to Aizawl in Mizoram.  Society, Religion and Economy  Singngat is inhabited by several tribes who have almost the same social order as well as community laws and follow Christianity. There are 13 (thirteen) denominations - Evangelical Baptist Convention (EBC), Presbyterian Church of India (Reformed) [PCI(R)], New Testament Baptist Church (NTBC), Manipur Evangelical Lutheran Church (MELC), Zou Presbyterian Church (ZPCS), Chin Baptist Association (CBA), Kuki Baptist Convention (KBC), Kuki Christian Church (KCC), United Pentecostal Church (UPC), Catholic Church, Salvation Army, Sabbath (Judaism) and Seventh Day Adventist. A major milestone had been achieved with the formation of Zomi Youth Association (ZYA) in Singngat in 2010. ZYA, thus, is the apex body of all philanthropic organisations in Singngat. Young Paite Association (YPA), Simte Youth Organisation (SYO) and Singngat Youth Club (SYC) became constituent members of ZYA Singngat. Most of the indigenous local inhabitants of the village depend on agriculture and earn their livelihood from growing crops. As the village is blessed with suitable Agro climatic endowments, various cash crops like gingers, soya beans, beans, brinjals etc., help the village to earn their revenue. The people mostly practice the traditional method of shifting cultivation, which is popularly referred to as jhum. Rice is the principal crop in the agricultural economy of the village. Cottage industries like handloom, furniture, agricultural equipment, woven textiles, and bamboo and cane work have also played vital role in generating revenue for the inhabitants. There are some shopkeepers, private teachers and daily wages workers too. The Army personnel and the government officials posted here contributed a significant portion of the cash flow in the economy of the village. Recently, there are some new entrepreneurs who have started mineral water bottling and other new innovative economic initiatives.  History of Singngat  According to the recollections of Khupkhanhau Munluo, the present chief of Singngat, the village was founded by Pu Sumtual from Suangzang (Burma) in 1800. They first settled in the present location of Standard High school and the village owed its name to the many thin and tall trees that were in abundance around the Galleng ravine. This was the earlier location of the village inhabited by the first settlers. The Chiefs of Singngat Pu Shingvial Munluo (1805‚Äì1845) Pu Shinghen munluo (1845‚Äì1905) Pu Sawmthong Munluo (1905‚Äì1915) Pu Tonghau Munluo (1915‚Äì1932) Pu Thangzalam munluo (1932‚Äì1948) Pu Khupkhanhau Munluo (1949-till date) The extent of Singngat Village When it was first founded, the geographical area of Singngat extended to Lanva river in the east, Tuivai river in the west, Tuitha (Khuga) river in the north and the southern end extended till Tuila river. The villagers often clashed with the villages under Haokip chieftainship. Since they were not able to protect the vast expanse of their territory, they made a truce and put up the head of a Mithun to mark the northern boundary of Singngat between the present day Mata Mualtam and Gelzang villages. As the Haokip chieftains expanded the area of their villages, they again clashed at Zezaw village and it came under the authority of the Haokip chiefs. The Haokip chiefs declared the area up to Likhai river as \\"Haokip Reserves\\" and at one point of time attempted to put Singngat villages under their authority. This led to Pu Letkhup Munluo and Suongpi Chief, Hemlam Haokip to a wrestling bout over the conflict. And as Letkhup emerged victorious, they agreed to keep the boundary of Singngat at Paldai river which remains the boundary of Singngat to this day.  Singngat Special  Singngat Special ‚Äì a light-hearted if somewhat derogatory term was first used in the 1970s, when Singngat's sister town to the north, Lamka saw the influx of mainland traders, mainly Biharis and Marwaris. They opened up tea hotels, offering milky teas with snacks. They had in their menu called 'Special Tea' which was a slightly milkier version of tea with cardamom or ginger as one may prefer. Somehow the trend of serving Special Tea at tea stalls spread around. As such, the very few tea stalls along the busy Tedim Road in Singngat town also began to have it on their menu, on demand. But the end result was quite different. The tea in Singngat tea stalls, which gradually came to be known as 'Singngat Special', was just too sweet. Legends have it that when travelers, who passed through Singngat, stopped at a roadside tea stall and ordered special tea, the tea-maker would simply add an extra spoonful of sugar - not from an ordinary teaspoon, but an aluminum serving size spoons which were in abundance back then. Increasingly 'Singngat Special' has acquired a negative connotation in different parts outside Singngat, implying excessive sugar being added to tea. In any social gathering, people from Singngat are generally subjected to ridicule over excessively sweet tea. The two-word phrase 'Singngat Special' is very much part of the Zomi vocabulary now. Even as connotations attached of the term may always lean towards negativity, folks from Singngat are beginning to feel the need to nudge the word \\"is\\" in between, turning a decades-old derogatory label into a badge of honor: \\"Singngat is Special\\".  The Brunts of Ethnic Conflict (1997-98)  Till the Kuki‚ÄìZomi Ethnic Clash 1997‚Äì98, Singngat had a fairly busy bazaar. It had been a prosperous town with different ethnic people living together harmoniously. But that has become a thing of the past. Sadly, the once bustling town now looks more like a ghost town - quiet, dark, desolate, empty, neglected and abandoned. A large part of the town was burned down. From then on, Singngat started treading the path of degeneration. Needless to add, the impact of the clash was devastating. It can be truly said that the Kuki- Zomi conflict was the root cause for the downfall and gradual disintegration of its morale, economy and progress of the town.  Border Model Town  Thanks to efforts by the powers that be, Singngat has been part of a military and civilian partnership that seeks to redevelop it as a Model Town.COAS gifts model village to Singhat . The Sangai Express (2006-08-09). Retrieved 2012-02-24.Sports facility inaugurated . The Sangai Express (2009-06-05). Retrieved 2012-02-24. Launched in 2005, the Singngat Military Civic Action project proposed to invest Rs 2,78,50,000 over the next three years or so on human resource development, educational enhancement, women empowerment and infrastructure development. This scheme involved renovation of the Government High School building, setting up of a Library and Recreation centre, children's park, hostel for boys and girls, erection of traditional gates, installment of solar-based street lightings, tree plantations, community hall, water harvesting schemes, vocational training centre, bus stand, and stadium and indoor complexes. It is unfortunate that while some of the components of the scheme have been implemented most of them are at best an unfinished agenda.  Local Administration   SDO office  Since the 1997 ethnic war, the government machinery had completely collapsed in Singngat. Gradual improvement is seen in the local administration with government officials starting to come back to their posts.  Police Department  The Singngat Police station was burnt down in 2002 by Meitei militants. New buildings and quarters are constructed where there once used to be a prison. Presently, the station is headed by Officer in-charge S. Thanglien Gangte. An average of 10 police personnel and some VDF personnel are manning the station at any given point of time.  Fire Department  Presently, 2 ASI, 2 fireman and 2 drivers are manning the Singngat fire sub-station. They are equipped with a single dilapidated fire engine even though they are reported to be vigilant in their duty.  Post Office  The Post office is situated next to the main market and there are only two postal staffs serving the entire town. It has been reported that the staffs come to office once in a while and the postal delivery system as it is now is found to be lacking.  Infrastructures   Information Technology  Singngat woke up to web accessibility in the early 2000s. A Community Information Centre under National Informatics Centre was inaugurated in 2002. Internet facility was opened to the public and training classes were held. Typewritten news bulletin gave way to laser-printed bulletin. A completely new digitized world had swept the hills of Singngat. However, irregular power supply is a hindrance towards the full growth and utilization of the centre.  Electricity  Foundation stone for a 33 kV sub-station Construction of 33/11 kv, 2x5 MVA substation at Singhat. Ministry of DoNER's Non Lapsable Central Pool of Resources. Retrieved 2012-02-24. was inaugurated on 23 April 2003 by Manipur Chief Minister, Ibobi Singh. From the commencement of this sub-station, there used to be a non-stop day-night power supply to the village though the standard has not been maintained in recent times. However, the town is getting better power supply than most other places in the state.  Communications  BSNL made its entry into Singngat in 2002 and the village has not looked back since then. Mobile and cellular services started in 2005 and 3G services have also commenced since September, 2011. BSNL still remains the sole service provider and some entrepreneurs have opened PCO booths using WLL sets. At some high elevation, we could get limited services from private operators like Aircel and Airtel.  Banking  A United Bank of India branch was functional during the 1980s. The building was damaged by fire during the great 1993 Singngat inferno. Since then, no banking service was available in the town. A new Central Bank of India branch was opened in April, 2012 and is functioning smoothly.  Lifelines   Drinking Water  Water scarcity has been grappling the people of Singngat since time immemorial. People have to undergo tremendous hardships in fetching water to as far away a tiny stream at over one to two kilometers, everyday, which sometimes is just barely a trickle from a small rivulet. To address the issue of perennial scarcity of drinking water, certain initiatives had been undertaken in the past. These are as follows: 1980s: An earthen dam was constructed by Pu Gougin, the then MLA at Paldai which soon proved to be a dismal failure. 1990s: With aid from an UN agency, an underground water pump scheme was initiated. It made water available for everyday use and was a great success. Sadly, most of the equipments were damaged during 1997-98 ethnic conflict. No such activity has been undertaken since then and the free and abundant availability of clean drinking water remains a distant dream for the town's inhabitants. 2006-07: An amount of Rs.16 Lakh was sanctioned for water harvesting scheme under the MCA project. The system works only during the rainy season. A few old tanks are the only existing testimony to this scheme. 2009-10: A sum of Rs. 204.64 lakhs was sanctioned by the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region for the augmentation of water supply in Singngat for the period 2009-2010.Projects sanctioned of Manipur during 2009-10.

But for reasons best known to the local administration, the work remains uncompleted till date. Local residents say that the tank built at Vomkaw River from where water was to be taken was sub-standard and has already been partially damaged.  Transport  Roads are our lifelines and economic arteries. But the Lamka-Singngat Tedim Road had always been in a horrible condition, despite a generous funding of Rs. 13.96 lakhs in 2003-04, Rs.63.57 lakhs in 2004-05, and Rs. 34.52 in 2005-06. This road was under the care of PWD, CCPur division. Rapid development began to be seen during 2007-08 and now the journey, which usually takes two hours, has been cut down to an hour and a half. The task of maintaining this road has now been given to Border Roads Organisation. However, there have been clamours from different quarters that the BRO's works need to be properly supervised. There are four daily bus services between Singngat and Lamka. The transport system is adequate at present since all passenger buses, trucks and vehicles coming from Behiang and Guite Road pass through Singngat.  Healthcare  In the 1980s, well-equipped doctors and nurses attended to patients under the sprawling expanse of the Singngat Primary Health Centre (PHC) building in downtown Singngat. A veterinary hospital was also there. During the 1990s doctors stopped visiting the place and the hospital building slowly rot away. The building was reconstructed in the early 2000s but it was never finished. At the present time, daily medical care is given to patients at a makeshift PHC in Bethel Veng under Dr. Khenzamung Samte, Medical Officer (MO). The MO along with two other doctors, Dr. Rupachandra and Dr. Salim Khan (a homeopathic) and about five nurses are doing a great job in providing the much-needed health care to the people of Singngat and the surrounding villages. However, the doctors visit only once every week or two, and so people have to fend for themselves most of the time. The Singngat PHC is not equipped with necessary medical equipment. People have to go to Lamka District Hospital for further medical tests and procedures. A new 10-bedded primary health centre (PHC) building was constructed at Mission Veng, Singngat and is now completed. Works for construction of doctors and nurses quarters are currently underway.  Education  The town of Singngat did not lag behind other places of Manipur in terms of education. There were four private schools and one government school. As the main government high school has been occupied by the Indian Army, classes have been shifted to the hostel building being built at HQ Veng under the MCA project. There are no regular students and the exact numbers of staff working here are not known. The four private educational institutions functional at present are: The Hill Model High School, St. Joseph's School, Standard High School and Salvation Army Jr. High School. The Hill Model High School, which was established way back in 1971, continues to be the premier educational institution. The school had even produced a top 5th position holder all over Manipur in the class X board examination in 1995. Politics Singngat is part of Outer Manipur (Lok Sabha constituency).

It was a historic event wherein diaspora Singngatians scattered across the globe came home to Singngat; an auspicious occasion wherein Singngatians were captivated by a momentary pang of nostalgia; a joyous moment wherein the present inhabitants and diaspora Singngatians shared their glorious past. In fact, it's a journey back to the times of Singngat Vanglaini. A time to reminisce. A time to honour the memories of the departed souls who walked the street of Singngat. And, a time to come back home! The gatherings while enjoying the glitzy moments incidentally got hold of the current scenario of Singngat. It is quite upsetting to observe that the town has been lying utterly neglected and deprived of developmental works and treading the path of degeneration. And no development works worth mentioning the name especially in the aftermath of the ethnic clash of 1997-98. The once bustling town now looks more like a ghost town - quiet, dark, desolate, empty, neglected and abandoned. With a sense of deep concern on the current state of affairs, the collective leaderships of Team Delhi, Team Shillong, Team Lamka, Team Imphal, Team Singngat, etc. have painstaking deliberations on the issue. The collective leadership, thereupon, unanimously resolved to adopt a vision document \\"Singngat Vision ‚Äì 2020\\" with a pledge to strive towards achieving the points given therein. The Vision is expected to be attained by 2020.Singngat releases Vision 2020 . The Sangai Express (2012-01-27). Retrieved on 2012-02-24. Singngat Vision 2020 1\\\\. Drinking water: Water scarcity that grappled the people of Singngat since time immemorial is expected to be a thing of the past. Areas around Singngat township including the villages of Sumchinvum, Haiyang, Lhaiyang, Muallum, Tangpizawl, Muvanlai, Khomunnuom, Sialnah, Lancha, Teikot, Likhai, Munpi, Simbuk etc. will be supplied with pure drinking water with the installation of a major water supply project by pumping water from Tuitha or Tuivai rivers that will be stored in reservoirs at different locations. Construction of a huge water reservoir on the upper course of Paldai stream is also another option which will also serve the twin purposes of a tourist attraction as well as a recreation centre (water sports). 2\\\\. Higher Secondary School: Upgrading of all the High Schools to Higher Secondary level in Singngat is expected to ease the burden of parents to a large extent. It is expected to be realized within the next two to three years. Students pursuing Higher Secondary Education (Class-XII) will no more need to leave the town for further studies. Besides, it is desirable that Private educational institutions particularly Higher Secondary schools in Lamka will be impressed upon the need to provide free education to the under privilege children by setting up branches at Singngat in terms of the policy of the government of India. 3\\\\. Community Centre cum Recreation Club: A Community Centre and Recreation Club will make its entry into the town by 2020. The Centre will house various indoor games viz Table tennis, badminton, etc. along with a public library. The center will cater to the needs of children for recreation and creative pursuits. 4\\\\. Sanitation: Clean and hygienic toilets will be installed at various points within the town. This will also encourage all households to have septic and hygienic toilets thereby paving the way for proper sanitation system in the village. Funding schemes for such activities will be explored through the National Toilet Mission/Sanitation Mission. 5\\\\. Road & Transport: All village roads will be blacktopped. Pavement and footpath will also be cemented by 2020. Road transport will also be properly improved. Highways or roads connecting Singngat, street lights and signage (sign boards) will be installed at convenient locations. 6\\\\. Telecommunication: BSNL will no longer be the sole Mobile and cellular service provider. Private Services like AirTel, Aircel, Vodafone, Reliance, etc. will make its entry into the town. The healthy competition amongst the service providers will also do away with the network problems. Besides, internet connectivity will also be made available which will facilitate reliable communication with other places of the world. The defunct CIC (Under NIC) will be made functional. 7\\\\. Hospital: Private or Mission Hospital will be set up by 2020. Private/Mission agencies will be contacted to survey the possibilities for setting up of such a hospital. It will provide the much needed health care facility of the town and its surrounding villages. Interested NGOs will be contacted for setting up Old Age Home, Orphanage Centre and Alcohol/Drug/Trauma Rehabilitation cum Counseling Center. 8\\\\. Economy: Cottage industries like handloom, furniture, agricultural equipment, woven textiles, and bamboo and cane work will play a vital role in strengthening the weak economy of the town. Sustainable developments will be facilitated by the suitable Agriculture, Plantation, Horticulture, Fishery, Poultry and Animal Husbandry projects thereby giving a boost to the economy. Banking facilities will be augmented to facilitate private entrepreneurs to set up craft centres and processing plants of local produces. 9\\\\. Tourist attractions: Naturally, Singngat is a beautiful hilly town with a pleasant climate. It is, therefore, observed that if efforts were taken to beautify the town it will attract tourists around the globe. Hotels and Resorts, recreation facilities etc. will be constructed at suitable locations to attract tourists. 10\\\\. Back to Singngat Project (Resettlement): Diaspora Singngatians will be attracted by the development that takes place in Singngat and its vicinity. New township will be developed between Tourist Lodge and Thadou veng with the active participation of the village Chief by shifting the localities of Bethel veng, Mission Veng, Station veng, Zion veng and Sim veng. Original settlers of Singngat Village who had left the place will be invited to resettle at Singngat by allotting house plots with the condition that each allotee shall construct a house within five years from the date of allotment. New road alignment from Tourist lodge (hausapu nahtang farm) approaching Thangpu Fishery pond and connecting Tiddim road at Guite road junction will be constructed to benefit the new settlement. The major project will include the construction of market complex, sports centres, Schools, etc. and a rehabilitation financial package to the affected families which is expected to result in a better living environment. It is expected that there will not be even a single Thatched Roofed House in the New Township. The Official name Singhat will be changed to its original identity i.e. Singngat. This Vision Document will be monitored very closely by the civil society and the implementation of the schemes being adopted will be reviewed on an annual basis by the Singngat Vision 2020 Implementation Committee. This Vision Document shall provide guidance to the Government of Manipur, elected representatives, Village chief, Village Authority members, concerned Government officials Philanthropic organizations, civil society leaders and the public at large. Adopted on this day, the 5th, January, 2012. ~By the Collective Leadership, Singngat Special Meet 2011  Singngat Special (Music Video) Album  As a way of promoting the Singngat Vision 2020 and showcasing the rich musical heritage of Singngat, the Singngat Vision 2020 Implementing Committee is recording a studio album titled \\"Singngat Special (Music Video) Album\\". This musical album features veteran singers as well as upcoming and established artists from Singngat. It consists of 16 tracks, of which three are original compositions and the rest are remakes of songs that were big hits during the heyday of Singngat.

Initial estimates were that the mine would be operational in 2010. The deal struck in 2007 was part of a policy shift by then Nigerien president Mamadou Tandja to break the four decade de facto monopoly held by Areva, a French state owned nuclear company, by bringing in Sino-U as a competitor. The Financial Times described the entry of Sino-U as a \\"battle for resources\\" between China and France and illustrated a competition view held by some that saw \\"China‚Äôs pursuit of Africa‚Äôs resources as a direct ‚Äì and potentially destabilising ‚Äì threat to western interests\\". In June 2007, one of SinoU's officials was kidnapped by rebels opposed to the building of the mine, but released shortly after.

With roughly 1,000 size population, this village snakes for about 2 km. along the Tedim road. Majority of the local population belongs to the ZOMI community.  History of Behiang  Tuan Thawng Leivang Ngaihte purchased the Behiang range along with the chieftainship of Behiang village from Langzachin Manlun, chief of Behiang village in 1922 by paying a sum of Rs.100/-(Rupees one hundred) with one Mithun. The then Sub-divisional officer/south West B.C.Gasper approved the transaction of chieftainship from Langzachin Manlun to Tuan Thawng Ngaihte in case No.43/SW of 1922-23 dated 28 January 1923. Further, the Assistant President, Manipur State Darbar (Hill) confirmed B.C.Gasper's order vides case No. 444-South dated 28 January 1923. Behiang village is 24 kilometers away from Singngat sub-divisional headquarters to the south on the Indian - Myanmar border. After the dead of Tuan Thawng Leivang Ngaihte his son Lian Za Mung Leivang Ngaihte became the village chief.  Successors of Behiang village chief  Tuan Thawng Leivang Ngaihte (1922-1957) Lian Za Mung Leivang Ngaihte (1958-1973) Lian Za Mung Leivang Ngaihte Lian Za Mung Leivang Ngaihte died leaving behind his minor son master Thawng Son Mang to succeed his will. But Thawng Son Mang being minor, the Family Household Council (Indongta) members decided that Pau Do Mang, son of Chin Kam, who was the youngest brother of Tuan Thawng Leivang Ngaihte should be the guardian of the minor Thawng Sawm Mang and act as the village chief. Master Thawng Son Mang abdicated the chieftainship by executing a special power of attorney in 1980 under which option was given to him either to remain as chief, or to hand over the chieftainship to Pau Do Mang. Master Thawng Son Mang opted to hand over the chieftainship to Pau Do Mang. Thus, Pau Do Mang became the chief since 1980. The Government of Manipur had given recognition to the chieftainship of Pau Do Mang Leivang Ngaihte vide order by the Governor of Manipur No. CHCH/4/86 date 12.2.2004 published in the Manipur Gazette Extra Ordinary No. 396 date 18.2.2004 and No.CHCH/4/86 (Pt) date 5.12.2006.57. Pau Do Mang Leivang Ngaihte (1974-till date) Ruins of World War II Constructed during World War II, the Tedim road passes through this village, and it connects the Indian city of Imphal and the Burmese town of Tedim. A contingent of the Japanese army took this road which was then still under construction. So, the Allied Forces destroyed some bridges on the Tedim road in order to check the advance of the Japanese troops. Ruins of British built bridges still remain near Behiang and surrounding villages like Tonzang and Zangnuam. The Old BSF Camp & the New AR Camp, Behiang Behiang used to have a regular camp of India's Border Security Force until recently. The Camp site is located on a lovely and commanding hill lock over the left bank of the Tuivai River overlooking the entire village and a major portion of the international border. The BSF were withdrawn from their camp in December 1998 during the midst of the ethnic clashes between Kuki - Paite tribes. In June 2006, the Assam Rifles (AR) were stationed in Behiang and they started constructing a new camp site which was officially occupied on January 2008. The AR Camp is currently located on the southern side of the village close to the Khenman boundary. Border Trade Centre Approved By Union Government Khenman is the nearest Burmese village from Behiang. For a number of decades, a brisk border trade has been carried out unofficially at this border village. Despite its potential, this bazaar village still lacks the infrastructure to develop into a booming commercial town. Aimed at boosting the Indo-Myanmar border trade, the Central Government of India had approved the setting up of an Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Behiang on 27 May 2012. On 3 October 2012, the State's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Konthoujam Govindas and the MLA of Singngat, GS Haupu accompanied by officials visited Behiang to ascertain land availability for the construction of the proposed Border Trade Center which is also part of the Union Government's Look East Policy. The visiting team has finalized a land area of 10 acres for the construction of the trade centre. Local Economy Behiang has a strong network of mercantile families who live off the Indo-Burma border trade. Several others have family members working in the Indian Army, Para-Military Forces and a few each in the State and Center Govt. service. Yet more than half of the local population engages in agricultural labour - either swidden (jhum) or wet rice cultivation. All arable land along the Tuivai river have been brought under paddy cultivation. Food shortage during the lean season just before harvest usually is met by the surplus rice produced by Burmese jhum farmers.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield, and the deanery of Nantwich. Its benefice is combined with those of St Mary, Acton, St David, Wettenhall, and St Oswald, Worleston. History It is possible that a Saxon church was originally on the site. This was replaced in 1541 by a timber framed church which in 1572 contained at least 50 coats of arms of the local nobility, either depicted in the stained glass or painted on the walls. In 1667 a storm damaged the roof and the west wall. At the beginning of the following century the tower partially collapsed and it was rebuilt in 1702. The rest of the church was still in a dangerous condition and it was rebuilt in 1720. A clock was added to the tower in 1722. There were fires in the church in 1798 and 1804 which led to a restoration in 1861. Further fires occurred in 1874 and 1885. In 1891 there was another restoration of the church, by Walter Boden. The previous internal alterations had weakened the structure of the church and in 2000 it was declared to be unsafe. A major restoration of the roof took place in 2002. During 2007 the tower roof was restored and the parapet rebuilt. A kitchen, new boiler house and refurbished toilets were added in 2012. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed of brick with stone dressings. It is believed that the stone pillars inside the church are from the previous building. The exterior walls are of locally-made brick, and the quoins and finials were made of stone from a quarry at Manley near Macclesfield. The plan of the church consists of a three-bay nave with a choir. At the east end is a shallow apse. The tower, in neoclassical style, is at the west end. The date 1702 is picked out in glazed bricks on the tower, either side of the clock face. On its west face are two round headed windows, one above the other.

The Man of Mode, or, Sir Fopling Flutter is a Restoration comedy by George Etherege, written in 1676. The play is set in Restoration London and follows the womanizer Dorimant as he tries to win over the young heiress Harriet and to disengage himself from his affair with Mrs. Loveit. Despite the subtitle, the fop Sir Fopling is only one of several minor characters; the rake Dorimant is the protagonist. The character of Dorimant may have been based on John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, though there is no evidence of this. The part was first played by Thomas Betterton and Sir Fopling, the flamboyant fop of the hour, by William Smith. In 2007, the National Theatre produced a modern dress production of the play, directed by Nicholas Hytner and starring Tom Hardy as Dorimant. Rory Kinnear received a Laurence Olivier Award for his performance as Fopling.

Footmen, etc.McMillin 1997, p. 89. Plot The protagonist of The Man of Mode is Dorimant, a notorious libertine and man-about-town. The story opens with Dorimant addressing a billet-doux to Mrs. Loveit, with whom he is having an affair, to lie about his whereabouts. An \\"Orange-Woman\\" is let in and informs him of the arrival in London of a beautiful heiress ‚Äì later known to be Harriet. Dorimant's closest friend and fellow rake, Medley, arrives and offers more information on her. Dorimant expresses his wish to break off his relationship with Mrs. Loveit, being already involved with her younger friend Belinda. The two friends plot to encourage Mrs. Loveit's jealousy so that she will break off the relationship with Dorimant. Young Bellair, the handsome acquaintance of both men, enters and relates his infatuation with Emilia, a woman serving as companion to Lady Townley‚Äîhis devotion is ridiculed. The three debate the fop Sir Fopling Flutter, newly come to London. Bellair learns of his father's arrival, that he lodges in the same place as his Emilia and of his desire for a different match for his son. A letter arrives from Mrs. Loveit and Dorimant departs. Lady Townley and Emilia discuss the affairs of town, particularly Old Bellair's professing of love for Emilia and his lack of awareness about his son's affections for her; he intends instead for him to marry Harriet. Young Bellair admits to having written a letter promising his acquiescence to his father's will in due time so as to deceive him. Medley arrives and boasts to the ladies of Dorimant's womanising status. Mrs. Loveit becomes enraged with jealousy at Dorimant's lack of attention to her, while her woman, Pert, attempts to dissuade her from such feelings. Belinda enters and informs her of a masked woman that Dorimant was seen in public with. Dorimant appears and accuses the women of spying on him and also that Mrs. Loveit has encouraged the affections of Sir Fopling; in a pretended state of jealousy, he leaves. Harriet and Young Bellair act as if they are in love to trick the onlooking Lady Woodvill and Old Bellair. Meanwhile, Dorimant and Belinda meet at Lady Townley's and arrange an imminent meeting. Emilia then reveals her interest in Dorimant to Belinda and Lady Townley. Belinda persuades Mrs. Loveit, on Dorimant's request, to take a walk on The Mall and be 'caught' in the act of flirting with Fopling. Dorimant meets with Fopling and pretends that Mrs. Loveit has affections for him (Fopling). When Mrs. Loveit encounters Fopling she acts flirtatious, in spite of not liking him and succeeds in making Dorimant jealous. Medley suggests he attends a dance at Lady Townley's which Harriet will be, though in the disguise of \\"Mr Courtage\\", to take his mind off Mrs. Loveit. Woodvill chides Dorimant and his reputation in front of him, not seeing through his disguise. Dorimant admits to Emilia that he loves Harriet but continues to be obstinate. Fopling appears and almost uncovers Dorimant but the latter leaves to meet Belinda. She expresses her jealousy at Mrs. Loveit, imploring him to never see her again. Young Bellair discovers his father's affections for Emilia, Harriet's for Dorimant and tells Dorimant. Belinda returns to Mrs. Loveit's in the early hours but taking the same hired chair that Mrs. Loveit had taken when she left Dorimant's, is suspected of being up to something. Dorimant arrives afterwards and confronts Mrs. Loveit; she says she is aware that he is only faking jealousy to spend time with another woman. Lady Woodvill and Old Bellair rush their children to get married. Dorimant interrupts; his true identity is revealed when Mrs. Loveit and Belinda arrive to confront him. Mrs. Woodvill is in dismay. Young Bellair and Emilia publicly show their love for each other. Old Bellair concedes to the match and Woodvill admits that she likes Dorimant despite the gossip she has heard about him. Harriet admits she loves Dorimant, so Woodvill allows for their marriage while warning Harriet that the match will bring ruin upon her. Both young couples will marry. Harriet advises Belinda and Mrs. Loveit to stay away from Dorimant (for their own good) and perhaps join a nunnery to preserve their goodness. Dorimant and Harriet will move back to the country to live with the Woodvills. Fopling is glad not to commit to anyone. Genre and style Brian Gibbons argues that the play \\"offers the comedy of manners in its most concentrated form\\".Gibbons (1984, xv). John Dryden used similar themes in his 1678 work Mr. Limberham; or, the Kind Keeper, but far less successfully; the play was only performed three times and has been described as his 'most abject failure.'

Screenwriting Boylan entered the entertainment industry as a stage actor while working as a newspaper reporter and publicist at the Los Angeles Express Tribune. He became acquainted with the business of film in the early 1920s when he took the position of director of publicity for Universal and First National. He began supervising a weekly newsreel for Universal. In the early 1920s, he wrote the story line for three short films. Boylan became editorial supervisor for Fox Pictures and, in 1925, he began to create silent-film screen titles for fun. He made a name for himself by writing titles for the 1926 silent version of What Price Glory. The quality of his work was so good that he was soon listed in credits as \\"Title Designer\\" in The Great K&A; Train Robbery with Tom Mix. With the advent of talkies, Boylan entered the realm of screenwriting in which he, primarily, worked as a script doctor. Though some of Boylan's screenplays were produced, he mainly contributed dialogue to scripts needing polish. His work creating additional dialogue started at Fox Pictures. Boylan later used his wordsmith skills at Columbia as well as at other studios such as Disney. Though much of his work was unbilled, Boylan contributed to/wrote more than 90 screenplays and teleplays between 1921 and 1963. Author Boylan wrote three novels between 1950 and 1961: *The Sword (1950), Little Brown Publishing, ASIN: B001IP8SXC *Gold Pencil (1953), Boston Little Publishing, ASIN: B001NY1W72 *The Passion of Gabrielle, (1961), Crown Publishers, ASIN: B001MQNIEG In addition, he contributed three short stories to the Saturday Evening Post in the late 1950s: * The Coivalrous Challenger, October 19, 1957 * Crisis on Blue Beach, June 27, 1959 * Whistle-Buoy Brady, October 4, 1958 Yachting and Coast Guard Having been surrounded by Lake Michigan while growing up in Chicago, as well as by the Atlantic Ocean while he was educated in Bermuda, Boylan was interested in sea-going and its vessels. The 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles sparked enthusiasm for small boat racing in the area. Actors and athletes founded their own Yacht Clubs. In 1933, writers in the Los Angeles area banded together to form their own yacht club with membership exclusive to writers. Boylan was the original Vice- Commodore of this organization which was named the Pacific Writer's Yacht Club. In 1934, after having been elected Commodore of the Yacht Club, Boylan invited Lt. Francis C. Pollard (commander of the US Coast Guard Cutter Aurora stationed in the Los Angeles Harbor) to join him on a voyage being conducted by the Yacht Club after Pollard donated his time to inspect the seaworthiness of club vessels. During the trip from Los Angeles to Catalina Island, discussions between the two men resulted in the formation of the United States Coast Guard Reserve and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. After the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and Reserves were founded by an act of Congress on June 23, 1939, Boylan rose to the office of Commodore in the Auxiliary (11th District); in addition, he retired with the rank of Lt. Commander in the Reserves. Personal Boylan was the son of American writer Grace Duffie Boylan and newspaper reporter/horse racing expert, Robert J. Boylan. He was educated via a tutor as well as in the education system in Bermuda. His older, half-sister, Clover Roe Roscoe, was also a screen titlist in the movie industry. Boylan was married twice. He wed Josephine Fountaine (sometimes spelled \\"Fontaine\\") when he was 21 years old. Josephine, the daughter of Colbert Fountaine, came from a large Quebecois-American family with many siblings including Frances Fountaine Frakes and Colbert D.

More settlers joined within a couple of years. Hiangzou became \\"a full fledged hill house tax paying village\\" on 10 July 2007 Village Authorities in Hill Areas) Act 1956.  Urban Sprawl  Hiangzou has electricity and metalled road. The growth of Hiangzou and its surrounding settlements partly reflect the urban sprawl of Lamka, (Churachandpur), which is the fastest growing town of modern Manipur.  Location  Branching off from Tedim road, Hiangzou is an extension of Zoveng and Khuga Tampak (Zoveng Meitei Leikai). Previously, the area was referred to as Lower Lamka. New Zoveng and Zomunnuom are eastward extensions of Hiangzou.  Background  Most Hiangzou residents are migrants from rural areas who fled their villages as a result of the Zomi-Kuki ethnic conflict (1997‚Äì98). In fact, a large number of them hailed from Singngat and Behiang area.

Some members are from other areas and wards of the Lamka town, and Bethel Church practically functions like a Free Church. The Christian Goodwill Youth Fellowship (CGYF) organizes recreational activities for the youths of Hiangzou and surrounding areas.

He also won the Grand Prix meet in Hengelo, and finished third at the Super Grand Prix meet in Doha, the Golden Spike Ostrava and the Bislett Games. Then, in July 2007 he achieved a new personal best time of 1:44.78 minutes at the Grand Prix meet in Athens. A fifth place at the All-Africa Games was followed by the entrance in the 2007 World Championships. Chepkirwok reached the final round, and in an unusually tight race, where all eight runners finished in the range of 1 minute 47 seconds, Chepkirwok finished fourth with 1:47.41. This was 0.02 seconds behind the bronze medalist, and 0.01 second ahead of the fifth placer. Rounding off the season, Chepkirwok finished seventh at the 2007 World Athletics Final. In the 2007‚Äì08 indoor season Chepkirwok competed at the 2008 World Indoor Championships. He reached the semi-final round, finished fourth there but did not progress to the final. During the summer he performed better. He opened with a second place in Doha, then won the ISTAF Golden League meet in Berlin. He then finished second at the Grand Prix meets in Madrid and Athens, and won the Super Grand Prix meet in Crystal Palace, London. In Madrid he had achieved a personal best time is 1:43.72 minutes, which is also the Ugandan record. Entering the 2008 Olympic Games, then, Chepkirwok was the only middle distance runner in the Ugandan squad. In the 800 metres competition he did not reach the final, however. He rounded off the season with a second place at the 2008 World Athletics Final. In early 2009 it was announced that Chepkirwok was a candidate for the title Ugandan Athlete of the Year. He eventually finished second runner-up for the award, behind Moses Kipsiro and Benjamin Kiplagat. In February 2009 he set a national indoor record in the 1000 metres, running in 2:18.18 minutes in Stuttgart. Chepkirwok is represented by PACE Sports Management, and is coached by Ricky Simms.

Guano Island near Walvis Bay in Namibia Guano (Spanish from ) is the accumulated excrement of seabirds and bats. As a manure, guano is a highly effective fertilizer due to its exceptionally high content of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium: key nutrients essential for plant growth. Guano was also, to a lesser extent, sought for the production of gunpowder and other explosive materials. The 19th-century guano trade played a pivotal role in the development of modern input-intensive farming, but its demand began to decline after the discovery of the Haber‚ÄìBosch process of nitrogen fixing led to the production of synthetic fertilizers. The demand for guano spurred the human colonization of remote bird islands in many parts of the world, resulting in some of the first examples of U.S. colonialism and the expansion of the British Empire. The guano mining process resulted in ecological degradation through the loss of millions of seabirds. Unsustainable guano mining in caves alters cave shape, causing bats to abandon the roost. Guano mining also involved the poor treatment and enslavement of workers such as Chinese immigrants, Native Hawaiians, and African diaspora. Guano is ecologically important due to its role in dispersing nutrients. Cave ecosystems, in particular, are often wholly dependent on bats to provide nutrients via their guano, which supports bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates. The loss of bats from a cave can result in the extinction of species that rely on their guano. Guano also has a role in shaping caves, as its high acidity results in erosion. Composition and properties Bird guano Bird guano has high levels of nutrients like nitrate and ammonium. By mass, it is 8-21% nitrogen; the nitrogen content is about 80% uric acid, 10% protein, 7% ammonia, and 0.5% nitrate. Some of bird guano's most common chemical elements are phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. It may react with the rocky substrate of islands like basalt to form authigenic, phosphatic minerals including taranakite and leucophosphite. Bat guano The mineral whitlockite, which is found in bat guano When freshly excreted, the guano of insectivorous bats consists of fine particles of insect exoskeleton, which are largely composed of chitin. Elements found in large concentrations include carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Through the action of bacteria and fungi, the fresh guano decays rapidly, usually losing its organic matter the fastest. Organic matter usually does not persist in a cave guano deposit at depths greater than a few centimeters. Fresh guano contains about 2.4-7 times as much carbon as nitrogen; the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio drops or remains similar when sampling older guano. Fresh guano has a pH of 5.1-7.3, making it neutral or somewhat acidic. However, as it ages, the guano becomes strongly acidic, reaching pH levels of 2.7-4.1. Similar to bird guano, the acidic properties of the guano and limestone of the cave can interact to create phosphatic minerals such as whitlockite, taranakite, variscite, spheniscidite, montgomeryite, and leucophosphite. Other minerals found in guano include quartz, graphite, gypsum, bassanite, and mica. Guano composition varies among bat species with different diets. Comparing guano from insectivores (Mexican free-tailed bats), frugivores (Rodrigues flying foxes), and sanguivores (common vampire bats), a 2007 study found that the three did not differ significantly in proportions of organic matter or carbon in dry matter. The sanguivore's had elevated carbon in organic matter, sanguivores and insectivores had elevated nitrogen in organic and dry matter, and insectivore and frugivore had elevated phosphorus. Frugivores had the greatest carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, while sanguivores had the greatest nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio and carbon-to-phosphorus ratio.  History of human use  Chincha Islands where guano was found in abundance. Mining was done on site and ships transported it to Europe. Bird guano Indigenous use The word \\"guano\\" originates from the Andean indigenous language Quechua, which refers to any form of dung used as an agricultural fertilizer. Archaeological evidence suggests that Andean people collected guano from small islands and points off the desert coast of Peru for use as a soil amendment for well over 1,500 years and perhaps as long as 5,000 years. Spanish colonial documents suggest that the rulers of the Inca Empire greatly valued guano, restricted access to it, and punished any disturbance of the birds with death. The Guanay cormorant is historically the most abundant and important producer of guano. Other important guano-producing species off the coast of Peru are the Peruvian pelican and the Peruvian booby. Western discovery and the Guano Age (1802-1884) Advertisement for guano, 1884 In November 1802, Prussian geographer and explorer Alexander von Humboldt first encountered guano and began investigating its fertilizing properties at Callao in Peru, and his subsequent writings on this topic made the subject well known in Europe. Although Europeans knew of its fertilizing properties, guano was not widely used before this time. Cornish chemist Humphry Davy delivered a series of lectures which he compiled into an 1813 bestselling book about the role of nitrogenous manure as a fertilizer, Elements of Agricultural Chemistry. It highlighted the special efficacy of Peruvian guano, noting that it made the \\"sterile plains\\" of Peru fruitful. Though Europe had marine seabird colonies and thus, guano, it was of poorer quality because its potency was leached by high levels of rainfall and humidity. Elements of Agricultural Chemistry was translated into German, Italian, and French; American historian Wyndham D. Miles said that it was likely \\"the most popular book ever written on the subject, outselling the works of Dundonald, Chaptal, Liebig...\\" He also said that \\"No other work on agricultural chemistry was read by as many English-speaking farmers.\\" The arrival of commercial whaling on the Pacific coast of South America contributed to scaling of its guano industry. Whaling vessels carried consumer goods to Peru such as textiles, flour, and lard; unequal trade meant that ships returning north were often half empty, leaving entrepreneurs in search of profitable goods that could be exported. In 1840, Peruvian politician and entrepreneur Francisco Quir√≥s y Ampudia negotiated a deal to commercialize guano export among a merchant house in Liverpool, a group of French businessmen, and the Peruvian government. This agreement resulted in the abolition of all preexisting claims to Peruvian guano; thereafter, it was the exclusive resource of the State. By nationalizing its guano resources, the Peruvian government was able to collect royalties on its sale, becoming the country's largest source of revenue. Some of this income was used by the State to free its more than 25,000 black slaves. Peru also used guano revenue to abolish the head tax on its indigenous citizens. This export of guano from Peru to Europe has been suggested as the vehicle that brought a virulent strain of potato blight from the Andean highlands that began the Great Famine of Ireland. Soon guano was sourced from regions besides Peru. By 1846, of guano had been exported from Ichaboe Island, off the coast of Namibia, and surrounding islands to Great Britain. Guano pirating took off in other regions as well, causing prices to plummet and more consumers to try it. The biggest markets for guano from 1840-1879 were in Great Britain, the Low Countries, Germany, and the United States. By the late 1860s, it became apparent that Peru's most productive guano site, the Chincha Islands, was nearing depletion. This caused guano mining to shift to other islands north and south of the Chincha Islands. Despite this near exhaustion, Peru achieved its greatest ever export of guano in 1870 at more than . Concern of exhaustion was ameliorated by the discovery of a new Peruvian resource: sodium nitrate, also called Chile saltpeter. After 1870, the use of Peruvian guano as a fertilizer was eclipsed by Chile saltpeter in the form of caliche (a sedimentary rock) extraction from the interior of the Atacama Desert, close to the guano areas. The Guano Age ended with the War of the Pacific (1879-1884), which saw Chilean marines invade coastal Bolivia to claim its guano and saltpeter resources. Knowing that Bolivia and Peru had a mutual defense agreement, Chile mounted a preemptive strike on Peru, resulting in its occupation of the Tarapac√°, which included Peru's guano islands. With the Treaty of Anc√≥n of 1884, the War of the Pacific ended. Bolivia ceded its entire coastline to Chile, which also gained half of Peru's guano income from the 1880s and its guano islands. The conflict ended with Chilean control over the most valuable nitrogen resources in the world. Chile's national treasury grew by 900% between 1879 and 1902 thanks to taxes coming from the newly acquired lands. Imperialism The demand for guano led the United States to pass the Guano Islands Act in 1856, which gave U.S. citizens discovering a source of guano on an unclaimed island exclusive rights to the deposits. In 1857, the U.S. began annexing uninhabited islands in the Pacific and Caribbean, totaling nearly 100. Several of these islands are still officially U.S. territories. Conditions on annexed guano islands were poor for workers, resulting in a rebellion on Navassa Island in 1889 where black workers killed their white overseers. In defending the workers, lawyer Everett J. Waring argued that the men could not be tried by U.S. law because the guano islands were not legally part of the country. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States where it was decided in Jones v. United States (1890). The Court decided that Navassa Island and other guano islands were legally part of the U.S. American historian Daniel Immerwahr claimed that by establishing these land claims as constitutional, the Court laid the \\"basis for the legal foundation for the U.S. empire\\". The Guano Islands Act is now considered \\"America's first imperialist experiment\\". Other countries also used their desire for guano as a reason to expand their empires. The United Kingdom claimed Kiritimati and Malden Island. Others nations that claimed guano islands included Australia, France, Germany, the Hawaiian Kingdom, Japan, and Mexico. Decline and resurgence In 1913, a factory in Germany began the first large-scale synthesis of ammonia using German chemist Fritz Haber's catalytic process. The scaling of this energy-intensive process meant that farmers could cease practices such as crop rotation with nitrogen-fixing legumes or the application of naturally derived fertilizers such as guano. The international trade of guano and nitrates such as Chile saltpeter declined as artificially synthesized fertilizers became more widely used. With the rising popularity of organic food in the twenty-first century, the demand for guano has started to rise again. Bat guano Aerial view of Guano Point. Old tramway headhouse is at the end of dirt road (right). Second tramway tower is more clearly visible, on skyline to right. Bat Cave mine is below, across the canyon. In the U.S., bat guano was harvested from caves as early as the 1780s to manufacture gunpowder. During the American Civil War (1861-1865), the Union's blockade of the southern Confederate States of America meant that the Confederacy resorted to mining guano from caves to produce saltpeter. One Confederate guano kiln in New Braunfels, Texas had a daily output of of saltpeter, produced from of guano from two area caves. From the 1930s, Bat Cave mine in Arizona was used for guano extraction, though it cost more to develop than it was worth. U.S. Guano Corporation bought the property in 1958 and invested 3.5 million dollars to make it operational; actual guano deposits in the cave were one percent of predicted and the mine was abandoned in 1960. In Australia, the first documented claim on Naracoorte's Bat Cave guano deposits was in 1867. Guano mining in the country remained a localized and small industry. In modern times, bat guano is used in low levels in developed countries. It remains an important resource in developing countries, particularly in Asia. Paleoenvironment reconstruction Coring accumulations of bat guano can be useful in determining past climate conditions. The level of rainfall, for example, impacts the relative frequency of nitrogen isotopes. In times of higher rainfall, 15N is more common. Bat guano also contains pollen, which can be used to identify prior plant assemblages. A layer of charcoal recovered from a guano core in the U.S. state of Alabama was seen as evidence that a Woodlands tribe inhabited the cave for some time, leaving charcoal via the fires they lit. Stable isotope analysis of bat guano was also used to support that the climate of the Grand Canyon was cooler and wetter during the Pleistocene epoch than it is now in the Holocene. Additionally, the climatic conditions were more variable in the past. Mining Workers load guano onto a cart in 1865 Process Mining seabird guano from Peruvian islands has remained largely the same since the industry began, relying on manual labor. First, picks, brooms, and shovels are used to loosen the guano. The use of excavation machinery is not only impractical due to the terrain but also prohibited because it would frighten the seabirds. The guano is then placed in sacks and carried to sieves, where impurities are removed. Similarly, mining in caves was and is manual. In Puerto Rico, cave entrances were enlarged to facilitate access and extraction. Guano was freed from the rocky substrate by explosives. Then, it was shoveled into carts and removed from the cave. From there, the guano was taken to kilns to dry. The dried guano would then be loaded into sacks, ready for transport via ship. Today, bat guano is usually mined in the developing world, using \\"strong backs and shovels\\". Ecological impacts and mitigation A large colony of Guanay cormorants on South Chincha Island of Peru in 1907 Bird guano Peru's guano islands experienced severe ecological effects as a result of unsustainable mining. In the late 1800s, approximately 53 million seabirds lived on the twenty-two islands. As of 2011, only 4.2 million seabirds lived there. After realizing the depletion of guano in the Guano Age, the Peruvian government recognized that it needed to conserve the seabirds. In 1906, American zoologist Robert Ervin Coker was hired by the Peruvian government to create management plans for its marine species, including the seabirds. Specifically, he made five recommendations: #That the government turn its coastal islands into a state-run bird sanctuary. Private use of the island for hunting or egg collecting should be prohibited. #To eliminate unhealthy competition, each island should be assigned only one state contractor for guano extraction. #Guano mining should be entirely ceased from November to March so that the breeding season for the birds was undisturbed. #In rotation, each island should be closed to guano mining for an entire year. #The Peruvian government should monopolize all processes related to guano production and distribution. This recommendation was made with the belief that a single entity with a vested interest in the long-term success of the guano industry would manage the resource most responsibly. Despite these policies, the seabird population continued to decline, which was exacerbated by the 1911 El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation. In 1913, Scottish ornithologist Henry Ogg Forbes authored a report on behalf of the Peruvian Corporation focusing on how human actions harmed the birds and subsequent guano production. Forbes suggested additional policies to conserve the seabirds, including keeping unauthorized visitors a mile away from guano islands at all times, eliminating all the birds' natural predators, armed patrols of the islands, and decreasing the frequency of harvest on each island to once every three to four years. In 2009, these conservation efforts culminated into the establishment of the Guano Islands, Isles, and Capes National Reserve System, which consists of twenty-two islands and eleven capes. This Reserve System was the first marine protected area in South America, encompassing . Bat guano Unlike bird guano which is deposited on the surface of islands, bat guano can be deep within caves. Cave structure is often altered via explosives or excavation to facilitate extraction of the guano, which changes the cave's microclimate. Bats are sensitive to cave microclimate, and such changes can cause them to abandon the cave as a roost, as happened when Robertson Cave in Australia had a hole opened in its ceiling for guano mining. Guano mining also introduces artificial light into caves; one cave in the U.S. state of New Mexico was abandoned by its bat colony after the installation of electric lights. In addition to harming bats by necessitating they find another roost, guano mining techniques can ultimately harm human livelihood as well. Harming or killing bats means that less guano will be produced, resulting in unsustainable mining practices. In contrast, sustainable mining practices do not negatively impact bat colonies nor other cave fauna. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) 2014 recommendations for sustainable guano mining include extracting guano when the bats are not present, such as when migratory bats are gone for the year or when non-migratory bats are out foraging at night. Work conditions Chinese laborers stand on a partially extracted guano deposit in 1865 Guano mining in Peru was at first done with black slaves. After Peru formally ended slavery, it sought another source of cheap labor. In the 1840s and 1850s, thousands of men were blackbirded (coerced or kidnapped) from the Pacific islands and southern China. Thousands of coolies from South China worked as \\"virtual slaves\\" mining guano. By 1852, Chinese laborers comprised two-thirds of Peru's guano miners; others who mined guano included convicts and forced laborers paying off debts. Chinese laborers agreed to work for eight years in exchange for passage from China, though many were misled that they were headed to California's gold mines. Conditions on the guano islands were very poor, commonly resulting in floggings, unrest, and suicide. Workers experienced lung damage by inhaling guano dust, were buried alive by falling piles of guano, and risked falling into the ocean. After visiting the guano islands, U.S. politician George Washington Peck wrote: Hundreds or thousands of Pacific Islanders, especially Native Hawaiians, traveled or were blackbirded to the U.S.-held and Peruvian guano islands for work, including Howland Island, Jarvis Island, and Baker Island. While most Hawaiians were literate, they could usually not read English; the contract they received in their own language differed from the English version. The Hawaiian language contract was often missing information about the departure date, the length of the contract, and the name of the company for which they would be working. When they arrived at their destination to begin mining, they learned that both contracts were largely meaningless in terms of work conditions. Instead, their overseer, who was usually white, had nearly unlimited power over them. Native Hawaiian laborers of Jarvis Island referred to the island as Paukeaho, meaning \\"out of breath\\" or \\"exhausted\\". Pacific Islanders also risked death: one in thirty-six laborers from Honolulu died before completing their contract. Slaves blackbirded from Easter Island in 1862 were repatriated by the Peruvian government in 1863; only twelve of 800 slaves survived the journey. On Navassa Island, the guano mining company switched from white convicts to largely black laborers after the American Civil War. Black laborers from Baltimore claimed that they were misled into signing contracts with stories of mostly fruit-picking, not guano mining, and \\"access to beautiful women\\". Instead, the work was exhausting and punishments were brutal. Laborers were frequently placed in stocks or tied up and dangled in the air. A labor revolt ensued, where the workers attacked their overseers with stones, axes, and even dynamite, killing five overseers. Although the process for mining guano is mostly the same today, worker conditions have improved. As of 2018, guano miners in Peru made US$750 per month, which is more than twice the average national monthly income of $300. Workers also have health insurance, meals, and eight-hour shifts. Human health Histoplasmosis endemism map for the U.S. Guano is one of the habitats of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which can cause the disease histoplasmosis in humans, cats, and dogs. H. capsulatum grows best in the nitrogen-rich conditions present in guano. In the United States, histoplasmosis affects 3.4 adults per 100,000 over age 65, with higher rates in the Midwestern United States (6.1 cases per 100,000). In addition to the United States, H. capsulatum is found in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Of 105 outbreaks in the U.S. from 1938-2013, seventeen occurred after exposure to a chicken coop while nine occurred after exposure to a cave. Birds or their droppings were present in 56% of outbreaks, while bats or their droppings were present in 23%. Developing any symptoms after exposure to H. capsulatum is very rare; less than 1% of those infected develop symptoms. Only patients with more severe cases require medical attention, and only about 1% of acute cases are fatal. It is a much more serious illness for the immunocompromised, however. Histoplasmosis is the first symptom of HIV/AIDS in 50-75% of patients, and results in death for 39-58% of those with HIV/AIDS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the immunocompromised avoid exploring caves or old buildings, cleaning chicken coops, or disturbing soil where guano is present. Rabies, which can affect humans who have been bitten by infected mammals including bats, cannot be transmitted through guano. A 2011 study of bat guano viromes in the U.S. states of Texas and California recovered no viruses that are pathogenic to humans, nor any close relatives of pathogenic viruses. It is hypothesized that Egyptian fruit bats, which are native to Africa and the Middle East, can spread Marburg virus to each other through contact with infected secretions such as guano, but a 2018 review concluded that more studies are necessary to determine the specific mechanisms of exposure that cause Marburg virus disease in humans. Exposure to guano could be a route of transmission to humans. Ecological importance The Ozark cavefish, a species that depends on bat guano as a source of food. Cave cockroaches on guano Colonial birds and their guano deposits have an outsize role on the surrounding ecosystem. Bird guano stimulates productivity, though species richness may be lower on guano islands than islands without the deposits. Guano islands have a greater abundance of detritivorous beetles than islands without guano. The intertidal zone is inundated by the guano's nutrients, causing algae to grow more rapidly and coalesce into algal mats. These algal mats are in turn colonized by invertebrates. The abundance of nutrients offshore of guano islands also supports coral reef ecosystems. Cave ecosystems are often limited by nutrient availability. Bats bring nutrients into these ecosystems via their excretions, however, which are often the dominant energy resource of a cave. Many cave species depend on bat guano for sustenance, directly or indirectly. Because cave-roosting bats are often highly colonial, they can deposit substantial quantities of nutrients into caves. The largest colony of bats in the world at Bracken Cave (about 20 million individuals) deposit of guano into the cave every year. Even smaller colonies have relatively large impacts, with one colony of 3,000 gray bats annually depositing of guano into their cave. Invertebrates inhabit guano piles, including fly larvae, nematodes, springtails, beetles, mites, pseudoscorpions, thrips, silverfish, moths, harvestmen, spiders, isopods, millipedes, centipedes, and barklice. The invertebrate communities associated with the guano depends on the bat species' feeding guild: frugivorous bat guano has the greatest invertebrate diversity. Some invertebrates feed directly on the guano, while others consume the fungi that use it as a growth medium. Predators such as spiders depend on guano to support their prey base. Vertebrates consume guano as well, including the bullhead catfish and larvae of the grotto salamander. Bat guano is integral to the existence of endangered cave fauna. The critically endangered Shelta Cave crayfish feeds on guano and other detritus. The Ozark cavefish, a U.S. federally listed species, also consumes guano. The loss of bats from a cave can result in declines or extinctions of other species that rely on their guano. A 1987 cave flood resulted in the death of its bat colony; the Valdina Farms salamander is now likely extinct as a result. Bat guano also has a role in shaping caves by making them larger. It has been estimated that 70-95% of the total volume of Gomantong cave in Borneo is due to biological processes such as guano excretion, as the acidity of the guano weathers the rocky substrate. The presence of high densities of bats in a cave is predicted to cause the erosion of of rock over 30,000 years.  Cultural significance  There are several references to guano in the arts. In his 1845 poem \\"Guanosong\\", German author Joseph Victor von Scheffel used a humorous verse to take a position in the popular polemic against Hegel's Naturphilosophie. The poem starts with an allusion to Heinrich Heine's Lorelei and may be sung to the same tune. The poem ends however with the blunt statement of a Swabian rapeseed farmer from B√∂blingen who praises the seagulls of Peru as providing better manure even than his fellow countryman Hegel. This refuted the widespread Enlightenment belief that nature in the New World was inferior to the Old World. The poem has been translated by, among others, Charles Godfrey Leland.Charles Godfrey Leland, Gaudeamus! Humorous Poems by Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, Ebook-Nr. 35848 on gutenberg.org English author Robert Smith Surtees parodied the obsession of wealthy landowners with the \\"religion of progress\\" in 1843. In one of his works featuring the character John Jorrocks, Surtees has the character develop an obsession with trying all the latest farming experiments, including guano. In efforts to impress the upper-class around him and to disguise his low-class origins, Jorrocks makes references to guano in conversation at every chance he can. At one point, he exclaims \\"Guano!\\" along with two other varieties of fertilizer, to which the Duke replies, \\"I see you understand it all!\\" Guano is also the namesake for one of the nucleobases that comprise RNA and DNA: guanine. Guanine was first obtained from guano by , who described it as xanthine in 1844. After he was corrected, Bodo Unger published it with the new name of \\"guanine\\" in 1846.

Its population was 98 at the 2010 census. It is located west of Trinidad along Colorado State Highway 12 in the valley of the Purgatoire River. History Segundo was founded by Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I;) as a company town to house its workers for a local coal mine. The town was the second mining community developed by CF&I; in 1904 behind Primero and was referenced in the town's name, with segundo meaning \\"second\\" in Spanish. CF&I; offered adequate housing for the time, and promoted upward mobility through its sponsorship of a YMCA center, an elementary school, small businesses, and a company store. Segundo was a prosperous town until the 1920s, when the population began to decline due to constant health issues related to air pollution and outdated housing that lacked indoor plumbing. Declines in demand for metallurgical coke led to workers being laid off and, following a major fire in 1929, CF&I; ceased their operations in Segundo. The town's population plummeted to the point that it almost became a ghost town.Glen D. Weaver and Ryan C.

Percoll is a tool for more efficient density separation in biochemistry that was first formulated by Pertoft and colleagues. It is used for the isolation of cells, organelles, and/or viruses by density centrifugation. Percoll consists of colloidal silica particles of 15‚Äì30 nm diameter (23% w/w in water) which have been coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Percoll is well suited for density gradient experiments because it possesses a low viscosity compared to alternatives, a low osmolarity, and no toxicity towards cells and their constituents. Percoll is a registered trademark of GE Healthcare.  Past use in artificial reproduction  Percoll was previously used in assisted reproductive technology (ART) to select sperm from semen by density gradient centrifugation, for use in techniques such as in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination. However, in 1996, Pharmacia sent out a letter to laboratories stating that Percoll should be used for research purposes only, not clinical. Pharmacia had not marketed it as a sperm preparation product; it had been repackaged and sold as such by third-party manufacturers. The FDA Warning Letter was due to concerns that PVP might cause damage to sperm (an unknown issue), and also that some batches of Percoll contained high levels of endotoxin (a known issue).

Status of Scientology in Belgium Belgium only officially recognizes six religions: Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Anglicanism, the Orthodox Church, Judaism and Islam. Scientology opened an international office in 2003 near the European Union headquarters to lobby for recognition as an official religious group. 2007 trial proposal In 1997, Belgian authorities began investigating the practices and finances of the Church of Scientology in Belgium after ex- Scientologists said they had been subjected to intimidation and extortion. Concluding the ten-year investigation, on September 4, 2007, a Belgian prosecutor recommended that 12 persons associated with Scientology and two legal entities ‚Äì the Belgian Church of Scientology and Scientology's Office of Human Rights ‚Äì should be prosecuted on counts of extortion, fraud, organized crime, obstruction of medical practice, illegal medical practice, invasion of privacy, conspiracy and commercial infractions like abusive contractual clauses. An administrative court would decide if the case would go ahead and charges would be pressed. The court's decision was expected to be announced within a few months.

History  Jetlag Productions started out as a small animation company assisting in the productions of such series as \\"The New Adventures of He-Man\\" in 1990 and \\"Conan the Adventurer\\" in 1992 until it was approached by Joe, Ken and Stan Cayre (known artistically as the Cayre Brothers) of GoodTimes Entertainment. The company then replaced Golden Films as GoodTimes' provider of budget animated productions when the contract with that company expired. Under the name of their new establishment, the Cayre Brothers produced a series of animated films that were very similar to those from Golden Films in style. Beginning their releases in 1994 Jetlag Productions produced a total of seventeen different animated films, thirteen adaptations of existing material and four original features. All seventeen films were around 45 minutes in length and were released as direct-to-video VHS features under the \\"GoodTimes\\" name by GoodTimes Home Video. Their last release was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which was released on April 30, 1996, just before GoodTimes turned to a new company, Blye Migicovsky Productions for their new line of animation releases. Jetlag Productions' films were revived on DVD under a \\"Collectible Classics\\" label in 2002 by GoodTimes Entertainment. The new releases were widely available until GoodTimes filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and all assets were transferred to Gaiam.

Instead, a variety of original compositions was created from scratch, produced by Andrew Dimitroff.  Original songs  As a general rule that went unbroken in all of their seventeen animated films, each film featured three original songs performed by a variety of singers. Jetlag Productions' successor for GoodTimes Entertainment, Blye Migicovsky Productions, continued this trend in their films. The instrumental bases to these original songs were sometimes used as part of the soundtrack outside the main musical numbers, as was the case in Hercules (1995) and Little Red Riding Hood (1995) among others. Though these musical numbers were placed into the films in often formulaic patterns, there were a few exceptions: A Christmas Carol (1994) was the only film to not feature an opening musical number while Hercules (1995) was unusual in that it ended with an instrumental rather than a vocal version of \\"Son of Zeus\\". Though the vast majority of the songs were performed by off-screen voices, Snow White (1995)'s \\"Hip Hip Hooray\\", Magic Gift of the Snowman (1995)'s \\"Sleep and Dream\\", Cinderella (1994)'s \\"(It's the) Chance of a Lifetime\\" and Leo the Lion: King of the Jungle (1994)'s \\"Out on My Own\\" were sung by actual characters within the films; Cinderella (1994)'s \\"When Love Has Gone Away\\" was the only duet performed by characters from the film, Cinderella and the prince, respectively.  Musicians  The credits attributed to the different composers and writers of the original soundtrack were listed in a formulaic manner in all seventeen animated productions, and were thus never associated with their actual compositions or performances. Among these credits, the following artists were credited as: *Music producer: Andrew Dimitroff *Composers: Nick Carr, Ray Crossley and Andrew Dimitroff *Lyricist: Joellyn Cooperman  Credited musicians  *Ray Crossley *Andrew Dimitroff *Milcho Leviev *Mel Steinberg *Leslie Woodbury  Uncredited vocalist performers  *Kathleen Barr (as the singing voice of Tooey in Leo the Lion: King of the Jungle (1994), performing \\"Out on My Own\\") *Garry Chalk (as the voice of Leo in Leo the Lion: King of the Jungle (1994), performing \\"I'm a Really Nice Guy\\") *Wendy K.

Each year, the Chumash community crosses from Channel Islands Harbor to Limuw (Santa Cruz Island) in a 17.2-mile journey. A tomol or tomolo (Chumash) or te'aat or ti'at (Tongva/Kizh), pronounced tiat, are plank-built boats, historically and currently in the Santa Barbara and Los Angeles area. They replaced or supplemented tule reed boats. The boats were between in length and in width. The Chumash refer to the tomol as the \\"House of the Sea\\" for their reliability. Double-bladed kayak- like paddles are used to propel the boat through the ocean. Some sources suggest the boats may have origins at Catalina Island and have been in use for thousands of years. The tomol has been described as \\"the single most technologically complex watercraft built in North America\\" and as being unique to \\"the New World.\\" The boats are still constructed by Chumash, Tongva/Kizh, and Acjachemen people today. Construction Tomols were preferably built out of redwood that had drifted down the coast. When supplies of redwood were lacking, local native pine was used. When splitting the wood with whalebone or antler wedges the crafters would seek straight planks without knotholes, then sand them with sharkskin. To bind the wood together, small holes were drilled in the planks so they could be lashed to one another. Finally, the seams were caulked with 'yop', a mixture of hard tar and pine pitch melted and then boiled. A crossplank at midship reinforced the boat and functioned as a seat. Another coat of 'yop' was used to waterproof the boat, followed by a coat of red ochre paint, followed by a final coat of sealant. Shell mosaics were often added as decorations. This style of boat is unique in the Americas, though researcher Yorem Meroz notes that a simpler plant is found in Chile and strakes were sewn onto dugout boat bases in the Pacific Northwest and Caribbean. The boats could take up to 500 days to be constructed by an experienced boatmaker. Tomols are propelled with kayak-like paddles with the user in a crouching position, unlike kayaks where sitting is the norm. They are highly maneuverable.  Significance  Eva Pagaling, a member of the Santa Ynez Band of Samala Chumash Indians, described the process of paddling in 2018 as follows: \\"During the crossing, a deep memory that‚Äôs shared among paddlers is that each pull of the oar is a prayer. And this year, I prayed for my loved ones, as well as everyone else in this world. I prayed for strength and healing for all people, wherever they may be on their path in life. Historically, we are water people and our medicine for the world can be found in the sacred and life-sustaining power of water.\\" The boats were described by Cindi Alvitre (Tongva), co-founder of Ti'at Society, in 2019 as \\"a vessel that allows humans to connect to the underworld.\\" In the Indigenous worldview, as Alvitre describes, \\"you have the underworld, which is watery existence, those deities that live underneath the ocean in their caves, the middle world, that's the existence of human beings, to the upper world, that's ancestral space. The ti'at is like an observation point, it's like you're hovering over the heavens of the underworld and being able to still have that connection to that ancestral space, to the stars, to the Milky Way.\\"  History  Artist rendition of a historical Chumash tomol. Tomols were an integral part of a widespread trading network between tribes who lived at what is now referred to as Point Conception, Santa Monica Bay, and the Channel Islands. There were designated shipping routes and signal fires were utilized on the land were used as aides for navigation. Most trade occurred between what are now two of the largest trading ports, Los Angeles and Long Beach, which was about a day's paddle. Tomols were so useful as to give rise to a new class in Chumash society: a guild known as the 'Brotherhood of the Canoe' which was \\"responsible for the construction of each new tomol, its boat-building knowledge handed down through the generation from senior craftsman to apprentice.\\" Only male members of leading families were allowed to own tomol. Grizzly or black bearskin identified the owners. When carefully maintained, the boats could last for decades and were passed down from one generation to the next. By 650 A.D., it is believed the tomol or te'aat was already of central importance to the Chumash and Tongva/Kizh respectively. In 1542, Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo recorded that he saw so many tomols hauled up at a particular wealthy village‚Äîa location eventually to be referred to by later settlers as Malibu‚Äîthat he named it pueblo de las canoas or \\"town of canoes.\\" Another explorer recorded the brotherhood doing boat carpentry in another village, and named it Carpinteria. Some scholars report that sewn plank technology may have been introduced by early Polynesian navigators sometime late in the first millenium, who had constructed sewn plank boats and had been known to have reached South America. Scholars state that \\"three native Californian boat terms are argued to be Polynesian loans: Chumashan tomol(o), and Gabrielino tarainxa (or taraina) and ti?at.\\" Some modern Chumash and Tongva/Kizh state that ‚Äúthis is something we have always known happened.\\" This was further explained in a short documentary episode by KCET produced in 2019. Partially intact tomols have been found in ancient Channel Islands middens along with dolphin bones, seal and fish bones, and abalone, clam, and limpet shells. The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, the Santa Barbara Maritime Museum, and The Chumash Maritime Association of California house reconstructed tomols created by contemporary Chumash.

Designed for use at low traffic-volume locations, the arrangement is common in the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Liberia, as well as in a number of, usually rural, locations in Ireland and Australia where visibility on the junction approaches is particularly poor. The stop signs at such intersections may be supplemented with additional plates stating the number of approaches. Operation In most jurisdictions of the United States, the rules of the all-way stop are the same. A motorist approaching an all-way stop is always required to come to a full stop behind the crosswalk or stop line. Pedestrians always have the priority to cross the road, even if the crosswalk is not marked with surface markings. * If a driver arrives at the intersection and no other vehicles are present, then the driver can proceed. * If, on approach of the intersection, there are one or more cars already there, let them proceed, then proceed yourself. * Should a vehicle be behind one of those proceeding cars, the driver who was there first will proceed before that vehicle. * If a driver arrives at the same time as another vehicle, the vehicle on the right has the right-of-way. * If two vehicles arrive opposite each other at the same time, and no vehicles are on the right, then they may proceed at the same time if they are going straight ahead. If one vehicle is turning and one is going straight, the right-of-way goes to the car going straight. * If two vehicles arrive opposite each other at the same time and one is turning right and one is turning left, the right-of-way goes to the vehicle turning right. Since they are both trying to turn into the same road, priority should be given to the vehicle turning right as they are closest to the lane. Driving instructors suggest that communication is always vital‚Äîincluding the use of turn signals to indicate which direction you intend to turn. Often, vehicles are able to make compatible moves at the same time without following the order listed above. If it is not clear who has the right-of-way, drivers should use good judgement until they clear the intersection. Within some U.S. jurisdictions, such as the state of Idaho, bicyclists are exempt from the need to make a complete stop, but must give way to other vehicles as otherwise required by law. In Australia, drivers must give way to other drivers on their right side after coming to a stop. Application All roads leading into an all-way stop have an octagonal \\"stop\\" sign with an additional plate indicating that they are an all-way stop junction In the United States, the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) defines the standards commonly used for the application of all-way stops. Where a stop has been determined to qualify, it is signed at all approaches to the intersections with a standard octagonal \\"Stop\\" sign, with a supplemental \\"All-Way\\" plate. Earlier editions of the MUTCD allowed supplemental plates specifying the number of approaches in an all-way stop, as in \\"2-Way\\", \\"3-Way\\" or \\"4-Way\\". According to the MUTCD, installation of an all-way stop should be based on a traffic engineering study to determine if minimum traffic volume or safety criteria are met. These intersections are often found where roads have light-volume traffic which does not justify a traffic light. An all-way stop may also be justified if the intersection has shown a history of collisions involving pedestrians or vehicles. All-way stops may also be used as an interim measure preceding the placement of a traffic light, to provide a low-speed area for pedestrians to cross, where a cross street experiences considerable difficulty finding safe gaps due to heavy traffic volumes, or where traffic is frequently delayed by turning conflicts. Additionally, the MUTCD advocates the placement of all-way stops at intersections between through roads in residential areas if an engineering study can show that traffic flow would be improved by installing it. Despite published guidelines, all-way stops are routinely placed by jurisdictions due to political pressure from adjacent residents. Intersections between two minor highways with similar traffic counts, two collector roads in an urban or suburban setting or a collector road and a local road in a busy setting (such as near a school) are the most common locations for an all-way stop. Traffic signals will sometimes flash red indications in all directions following a malfunction, or all-red flashing operation may be scheduled to reduce delay or handle construction activity or unusual traffic patterns. When a traffic signal flashes in all-red mode, it legally operates as an all-way stop.California Vehicle Code section 21457: Flashing signals When all approaches to an intersection are controlled in this way the rules for an all- way stop apply. Traffic signals may also flash yellow to major directions and flash red to minor directions during off-peak times to minimize traffic delays, in which case only side-street traffic is required to stop and yield the right of way to crossing traffic on the major street. During electrical outages when a traffic signal does not display any indications including flashing red, some jurisdictions require that the intersection be treated as an all-way stop. Other jurisdictions treat a dark signal as an uncontrolled intersection, where standard rules of right-of-way apply without the requirement of a complete stop. Benefits and disadvantages The main reason for the use of stop signs at road junctions is safety. According to an international study of locations where the system is in use, all-way stop control applied to four-legged intersections may reduce accident occurrence by 45%. However, given alternative methods of intersection control and some of the disadvantages of all-way stops, the Handbook of Road Safety Measures recommends that four-way stops are best used between minor roads away from urbanized areas. Another benefit of all-way stops is assurance that vehicles enter the intersection at a low speed and have more time to take heed of the traffic situation, especially useful when sight distance is highly restricted. Some of the disadvantages associated with all-way stops are: * Increased emissions of hydrocarbons. * Increased average delay. * Increased wear on vehicle brakes * Discouraging bicycling. * That once installed, stop signs in general are unsafe to remove, accidents that result in injury may increase by 40%. Once an all-way stop is installed, removal is difficult and risky, as habitual drivers may continue to expect an all-way stop condition. Worldwide comparisons An all-way stop in Sweden Few countries outside North America ‚Äì least of all, those in Europe ‚Äì have intersections at which all users must stop at all times; the conditions for stop sign placement may indeed preclude such an arrangement in many places. In Sweden all-way stops (Flerv√§gsstopp) have been tested since the 1980s but are little used even though they are now permitted. In the UK they have always been very uncommon and were formally prohibited by the Department for Transport in 2002. Four-way stops are common in the Southern African Development Community area, with priority going to the first vehicle to arrive and stop at the line. At four-legged intersections within Europe, a roundabout or mini-roundabout is commonly used to assign a relative priority to each approach. (Roundabouts remain rare in North America, where early failures of rotaries and traffic circles caused such designs to lose favor until the gradual introduction of the modern roundabout in the late 20th century.) Alternatively, at smaller intersections, priority to the right is widely used in most countries.

It is located in North end, Luxton neighbourhood, Winnipeg on Anderson Avenue near Main Street and the Red River. St. John's Cathedral marks the birthplace of the Anglican Church in Western Canada. History Early history In 1817, Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk choose the site in which a church would be built In 1812, the first group of Selkirk Settlers established a burying ground immediately south of the present cathedral. It is the oldest Canadian Anglican parish west of the Great Lakes, which was established in October 1820 when the Rev. John West, the first Anglican priest in Western Canada, arrived from England under the auspices of the Church Missionary Society and the Hudson's Bay Company in the Red River Colony (or Selkirk Settlement) to serve as chaplain to the Hudson's Bay officers and men, missionary to the aboriginal people in the area, and pastor to the Selkirk Settlers. The site for the church was chosen by Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, during his visit to the settlement in the summer of 1817. The majority of the Selkirk Settlers were Presbyterians, but they attended Anglican services until the first Presbyterian minister arrived in 1851. There have been four churches on the site. The first was a Church Mission House constructed in 1822 by the Rev. John West near the south-east corner of the present cemetery; however, it was washed away in the great flood of 1826. In 1833 it was replaced by a second church, a stone building built on the site of the present Cathedral. This second church became the first Anglican Cathedral in Western Canada soon after the first Bishop of Rupert's Land, the Rt. Rev. David Anderson, was consecrated in 1849. The building was severely weakened by the flood of 1850, and thus a third building, also of stone, was erected on the same site from 1862 to 1863. Present building (1926‚Äìpresent) The fourth and present Cathedral was reconstructed in 1926 using most of the stone from the previous building under the guidance and inspiration of Archbishop Samuel P. Matheson. It was regarded by him as a tribute and memorial of his predecessor, Archbishop Robert Machray. Archbishop Machray, who succeeded Bishop David Anderson in 1865, is regarded by many local Anglicans as having given unsparingly of his time and talents to St. John's and the Diocese of Rupert's Land for almost forty years. In 1893 he became the first Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada. Since 2002, St. John's Cathedral has been the only Canadian site to host the annual Trinity Conference by web cast from New York. In September, 2004, St. John's Cathedral was designated as a Heritage Site by the Hon. Eric Robinson, Manitoba Minister of Culture, Heritage and Tourism. The historical designation covers both the cathedral and the surrounding cemetery. In 2012, the Cathedral hosted a service of thanksgiving in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Red River Settlement (or Red River Colony). Those attending included today's Lord Selkirk, James Douglas-Hamilton, Baron Selkirk of Douglas, along with many descendants of the original settler families. Design The present cathedral was designed by architects Parfitt and Prain, the cathedral is Norman-Gothic in style. The chancel was extended by eight feet in 2005 to allow for use of a chancel altar. All the furnishings in the chancel, with the exception of the organ console, can be removed, providing space for concerts, dance recitals, plays and other activities. In 2004 a sound and light booth, coat racks and library were installed in the narthex. The lighting in the Cathedral was upgraded in 2007. Stained-glass windows at the cathedral The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the historical and traditional stained glass at Cathedral of St. John (Winnipeg). The organ, a gift of the women of the parish in 1927, is a three-manual Casavant pipe organ of thirty-nine speaking stops. In 1927, the organ cost $8,700.00 CAD. Its replacement cost today would be close to $750,000.00 CAD. In addition to the organ, the Cathedral also uses a fine Baldwin grand piano. Furnishing Furnishings of interest are the solid brass eagle lectern (known affectionately as Big Bird since it was installed), a gift in 1890 to Archbishop Robert Machray on the 25th anniversary of his consecration as bishop, the intricately carved hexagonal oak pulpit (1907), the Italian marble font (1870), and a Coventry cross, made of nails salvaged from the mediaeval Coventry Cathedral which fell victim to the Blitz in World War II. The Cathedral also has a wealth of stained glass windows by various designers. Cemetery The cemetery, which surrounds the cathedral, is considered by locals as the history of Winnipeg in stone. It was established by the Selkirk Settlers after their arrival in the Red River Colony (Selkirk Settlement) in 1812, so it pre-dates the parish by eight years. The oldest marked grave (1832) is that of eight-month-old George Simpson, son of George and Francis Ramsay Simpson, the Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company and his wife. The earliest graves were destroyed in the flood of 1826. Among the prominent citizens whose resting place is the cemetery are William Forbes Alloway, John Ogle Anderson, Alfred Andrews, James Henry Ashdown, Dan Bain, Derek Bedson, Samuel Lawrence Bedson, George Montegu Black, Sr., Aileen Alexia Allingham Clarke, Dean Coombes, Horace Everett, Edward Anthony Wharton Gill, Bishop John Grisdale, John Inkster, Archbishop Walter H.

Sir Sam Steele, Archbishop Isaac Stringer, Edna Sutherland, John Sutherland (Canadian Senator), John Barton Taylor, James Thomson, Lieutenant Governor William Johnston Tupper and Lieutenant Governor Errick Willis. Community involvement The Cathedral engages in many ministries. Among these is the Outreach Ministry which provides financial support in the form of grants to organizations and groups in Winnipeg's North End with programs like literacy projects, community kitchens and bursaries that help to improve and enhance the life of the residents of the area. The Cathedral also supports a ministry that provides a home for refugees newly arrived in Manitoba. Every year the Cathedral congregation contributes to Winnipeg Harvest's Shelf-Help program and also supports the Thelma Wynne Project with clothing for newborns and its own Joshua Tree program which provides children from low-income families with hats, scarves and mittens - most of which are handknit by members of the congregation. Every year, the Cathedral's unique Festival of Advent Lessons and Carols draws visitors from all over the Diocese of Rupert's Land with a re-enactment of a period of the Cathedral's rich history. Today, St. John's Cathedral truly lives up to its motto as the parish that cherishes its past, looks to the future and lives in the present.

The \\"instrument\\" used to perform a cybersymphony consists of two things: the cybersymphonic law that defines what the instrument is, and any synthesizer that meets the requirements.

The Cybersymphonic Law summarised: * All sounds must have a real counterpart (violin, oboe and so on, with the correct register span). * All instruments must be played like the real counterpart (i.e.: technical limitations must be observed). * All instruments or instrument sections must be located on separate midi channels * No sampling of mixed sounds may occur. * The Orchestral dynamic is created by the parts individual dynamics. * No dynamic event may occur in the section sounds or instruments sounds * Dynamic is formed by continuous volume and the keystroke * The orchestral timbre is created through the sum of the sounding separate midi channels Some works * Cyborg Piano Concerto nr 1 (1981) * The child and the soul of logic (1984) * Three Psychological portraits (1989) * Psychopath predominantly aggressive * Schizophrenic reaction type catatonia * Die grosse compressed crocodile symphony * Urbana * Voluspa * Baltic ode (1990) * Excalibur Piano Concerto nr 3 (1993) * Tales from lord of the rings 1 (1993) * Tales from lord of the rings 2 (1995) * Symphony for a dead world (1994) * The Insects Collection (1993‚Äì95) * The Omega point theory (1994) * The Marriage of heaven and hell (1996) * The Millennium Symphony (1997) * WasteLands (1997) * Europe a prophecy (1998) * Eddan ‚Äî the invincible sword of the elf-smith (2008) Sources * STIM - the Swedish Performing Rights Society External links *Eddan *www.matswendt.com *Cybersymphonic Institute Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Living people Category:1965 births Category:Male classical composers Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Mats Wendt"},{"id":"13097064","text":"Bibliography for Harold Pinter is a list of selected published primary works, productions, secondary sources, and other resources related to English playwright Harold Pinter (1930‚Äì2008), the 2005 Nobel Laureate in Literature, who was also a screenwriter, actor, director, poet, author, and political activist.

Individual entries consisted of (sometimes book-length) articles by prominent classical scholars, Fran√ßois Lenormant among them. It aimed to compete directly with the Altertumswissenschaft of German universities, who were the uncontested masters in the field from 1810 onward. In an 1887 review of the first volume of the Dictionnaire for The Classical Review, John E. B. Mayor praised the result, saying \\"No other nation as yet possesses anything approaching to it in beauty and completeness; it is absolutely necessary to every classical library and to every public library frequented by scholars or artists.\\" The Dictionnaire represented a work of extraordinary volume and was published at a slow pace. It took eleven issuings to finally complete volume 1, which spanned 1,703 pages and only covered through the letter C, in 1886. The first volume included 3,000 illustrations. Each of the eleven parts of the first volume, printed in large quarto form, was sold for five francs. Some thirty years after it was begun, the Dictionnaire had only reached the middle of the alphabet. Today the dictionary has value as a legacy work, amongst the other large dictionaries of antiquity that appeared in Europe around the same time: starting in 1893, the Germans published the monumental Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft in eighty-three volumes; the Italian Dizionario epigrafico di antichit√† romana began in 1886; the English also published several dictionaries concerning the fields of classical antiquity, including William Smith's 1,300-page A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, first published in 1842. Although the articles are sourced from scholarship in a number of different fields, its contents are no longer up-to- date because of archaeological, epigraphical, and numismatic discoveries made in the years since the Dictionnaire's writing. The problems of studies of classical antiquity have also been profoundly renewed in the intervening years thanks to the contributions of sociology and anthropology, fields from which specialists in antiquity have integrated the methods.

In its early years, it was one of two private airports located in Beaverton, the other being Watts Field, about one-half mile to the south of Bernard's Airport.Jones, Webster A. (May 8, 1932). \\"Nine bustling airports now operate in and near Portland\\". The Sunday Oregonian, Section 4, p. 1 (including map). The Bernard Airport site was redeveloped in 1969 as \\"Bernard's Beaverton Mall\\", now known as Cedar Hills Crossing. History Both of Beaverton's airports were opened in the latter half of the 1920s. The first was Watts Field, or Watts Airport, located on the west side of Erickson Avenue, along what is now 6th Street, to the southwest of the center of town. Different sources give its opening year as either circa 1925‚Äì26 or 1928. Its site was originally developed as a motion picture studio in 1922, Premium Picture Productions opening its Beaverton Studios on the site in that year. The airport was named for Dr. G.E. Watts, the financier behind the film venture in Beaverton, who was also an aviation enthusiast. Premium Pictures went out of business in late 1925, after filmmaking on the West Coast became concentrated in Hollywood, and in 1928 the buildings were sold to Davis-Langman Aircraft Corporation, but G.E. Watts remained an investor. The film studio site was converted into an airstrip. In 1929, the facilities were sold to the Breese Aircraft Corporation (of San Francisco), for use in aircraft manufacturing.Planes Will Be Built; Beaverton Site Bought By Breese Company\\". (February 5, 1929). The Morning Oregonian, p. 13. The first airplane manufactured in Beaverton was launched in April 1930, and the Watts airstrip was used for many test flights. Bernard Airport in 1934 Later in 1928, Beaverton's second airport began to take shape, as Charles Bernard erected the first hangar along what is now Cedar Hills Blvd. (then Cedar Street), to the northwest of the center of Beaverton. Named Bernard's Airport, it was located about one-half mile north of Watts Airport, immediately north of Beaverton Creek (with its south end just south of present-day Hall Blvd.). Air & Space/Smithsonian has stated that the real history of grassroots aviation in Oregon began in \\"the hayfields of Beaverton\\" (i.e. Watts Field and Bernard's Airport), where aircraft innovation design achieved a wide circle of inventors and pilots. As of 1932, Watts Airport had of land, with 10 airplanes based there (and room for 40 planes), and was the third-busiest of nine airports then operating in the Portland metropolitan area, while Bernard's Airport occupied and had only three planes based there at that time. Expansion Aerial view of Bernard's Airport in 1966, looking north Activity at Watts Airport began to outgrow the site, so some of its users convinced 'Charlie' Bernard (as he was commonly known) to expand his nearby airport. Several additional wood frame hangars were constructed, designed by George Edward Moshofsky, a Beaverton builder whose home was across the street from the airstrip. The unusual design, which accommodated the aircraft wings, was later depicted in a mural at the Salem Airport. The home-built airplane industry in Beaverton thrived. Bernard's Airport and Watts Airport were still in operation concurrently in 1935,Jones, Webster A. (March 3, 1935). \\"Swan Island [Air-] Port Carries Big Load; Aviation Facing Crisis Due to Landing Field Dearth\\". The Sunday Oregonian, Section 1, p. 13. but Watts Airport closed not long afterwards, leading to still more expansion at the Bernard airfield. The Oregonian of September 11, 1938, stated that Bernard Airport was \\"perhaps the busiest non-commercial airport in the United States\\". By 1955, Bernard's Airport had 44 wooden hangars, along with numerous open sheds (or \\"plane- ports\\") capable of housing more than 100 additional light aircraft.\\"Richards, Leverett G. (November 20, 1955). \\"Beaverton's Busiest Pasture\\". The Sunday Oregonian, \\"Northwest\\" magazine section, pp. 14‚Äì15.

(November 14, 1963). \\"Beaverton Airport Owner Ponders Sale Of Site For Portland Housing Development\\". The Oregonian, p. 20. Problems  The Cedar Hills residential area was built between 1946 and 1955, to the north of the airport. Some residents disliked having airplanes flying so near their homes and in 1955 a group of 34 property-owners filed a lawsuit claiming that the planes were trespassing in the airspace above their properties, in an attempt to force the airport to close.\\"Airport Hit In New Suit\\" (July 24, 1955). The Oregonian, p. 38. A circuit court judge ruled against them. However, soon afterward, Jenkins Road was built, cutting across the north end of the runway, despite objections by Charlie Bernard and others to the county commission. In 1963, Bernard considered selling his then- property for redevelopment as housing, after his airport began to lose money, a change he attributed to a big increase in his property taxes. Bernard was still living nearby at the time, in his family's old farmhouse on Walker Road. He decided against selling at that time. Closure In January 1969, Bernard announced that he had leased his , including the 40 acres of airport property, to a group of developers and that the airport would close in February.\\"Oregon's Oldest Airport Closes\\". (January 17, 1969). The Oregonian, p. 21. The airport was to be replaced by a shopping mall. Closure of the runways was set for February 1.

It is situated in a campus of artist-renovated military buildings in the Marin Headlands, in Marin County, California.  Mission and history  Headlands Center for the Arts (Headlands) provides an environment for creative process and the development of new work and ideas. Through artists‚Äô residencies and public programs, Headlands offers opportunities for artist research, dialogue and exchange that build understanding and appreciation for the role of art in society. Headlands Center for the Arts was conceived through a planning process conducted by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area after the transfer of former military property to the National Park Service. The Park Service engaged a number of nonprofit organizations as \\"Park Partners\\", to assist them in restoring the historic buildings and developing interpretive programs for the public. Headlands was incorporated in 1982 by a founding board of directors consisting primarily of local artists. In 1994 Headlands secured a long-term cooperative agreement for use of the buildings within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.  Headlands campus  Originally inhabited by Coast Miwok, the area was used for military installations including Fort Barry for more than a century, before the United States Army withdrew in 1972 and turned over the land to the National Park Service. Headlands is housed in a cluster of nine historic, 1907-era military buildings at Fort Barry. Residency studios, offices and public rooms are located in two four-story former army barracks. Since 1985, Headlands has renovated these historic structures through granting commissions to artists. Major American artists, including Ann Hamilton, David Ireland, Bruce Tomb, and John Randolph, have designed and supervised the renovation of the public rooms in the main building. In 1998, artist Leonard Hunter and architect Mark Cavagnero led the award-winning rehabilitation of a nearby 1907 Army storage depot, which now houses the Affiliate Artist program studios.  Artists-in-residence program  The Artist in Residence (AIR) Program has earned international renown for bringing together pioneering artists in all disciplines ‚Äî visual, literary, performing and new media ‚Äî from throughout the U.S. and abroad. The AIR program provides a supportive working environment that allows time for artists to experiment, reflect and grow, both individually and collectively during their stay. The program offers fully sponsored live-in and live-out residencies to approximately 30 artists each year, from March to November, and is distinguished in that there is no fee to participate. Residencies range from one to six months, with an average live-in stay of three months. The focus is on the artist‚Äôs process of investigation and creation rather than on the presentation of work. AIRs join a community of up to 70 artists a year (including Affiliate Artists, MFA Award, and Tournesol Award winners), with an average of forty on site at any time. Artist studio facilities The Fort Barry campus is home to nearly 40 studios, shared residences, and spaces for offices, performances and events. Residency studios, offices, and public rooms are located in two four-story former army barracks with 13-foot ceilings, large windows, period detail, and hardwood floors. Housing and other benefits Live-in residents share historic military officers‚Äô houses.

Including the adjacent road in Howard County known as Woodstock Road, the highway runs from Maryland Route 99 (MD 99) near Woodstock east to Joppa Road near Towson. Old Court Road includes two county-maintained sections and two Maryland state highways, Maryland Route 125 and Maryland Route 133. MD 125 has a length of between Woodstock and the edge of Randallstown and MD 133 spans between MD 129 and MD 25 in Pikesville. Old Court Road connects the western and central Baltimore County communities of Granite, Randallstown, Milford Mill, Pikesville, and Towson. Old Court Road has been a cross-county highway since the colonial era. The highway was fully paved in Baltimore County by the mid-1920s, including the sections of the highway that became MD 125 and MD 133. MD 133 was extended west to MD 140 and MD 125 was extended west to MD 99 in the early 1930s; MD 125's terminus returned to the Patapsco River in the mid-1950s. Old Court Road was relocated at its eastern end in the early 1960s and in Pikesville in the late 1960s, at which time MD 133 assumed its current course. Route description View west along the MD 125 section of Old Court Road in Randallstown Woodstock Road begins at an intersection with MD 99 (Old Frederick Road) northwest of Ellicott City. The two-lane undivided county highway passes through farmland then has a forested descent into the narrow Patapsco River valley. MD 125 begins within the hamlet of Woodstock, where the highway has a grade crossing of CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision and crosses the Patapsco River into Baltimore County. The state highway, now known as Old Court Road, passes an entrance to Patapsco Valley State Park and the former grounds of Woodstock College as it ascends out of the river valley. MD 125 has a curvaceous path through the village of Granite, which is preserved as the Granite Historic District. The state highway continues through farmland to its eastern terminus at an arbitrary point east of the Patapsco River. Old Court Road continues as a county highway into the suburban area of Randallstown. The highway expands to a four-lane undivided road shortly before its intersection with MD 26 (Liberty Road). Old Court Road passes along the northern edge of Milford Mill community and crosses over I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) just south of its interchange with I-795 (Northwest Expressway). The highway crosses over MTA Maryland's Baltimore Metro SubwayLink next to the transit line's Old Court station and passes under CSX's Hanover Subdivision. In the center of Pikesville, Old Court Road intersects MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) and follows the southern edge of Druid Ridge Cemetery to Sudbrook Lane close to Mettam Memorial Baptist Church. Old Court Road continues along the line of Sudbrook Lane to its intersection with MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue). View east along the MD 133 section of Old Court Road in Pikesville Old Court Road continues as MD 133, which immediately turns east as county-maintained Stevenson Road continues straight. The state highway carries two lanes past several farm fields between suburban subdivisions and Beth Tfiloh Dahan Community School. MD 133 intersects Greenspring Avenue just south of I-695 then passes through several curves, during which the highway passes the Park School of Baltimore. MD 133 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 25 (Falls Road) within the Rockland Historic District. The roadway continues east as Ruxton Road, which has a half-diamond interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway) that allows access to and from Baltimore. At the exit ramp from northbound I-83 to Ruxton Road, the eastern segment of Old Court Road heads north parallel to the freeway. Before I-83 has its southern interchange with I-695, Old Court Road curves east and reaches its eastern terminus at Joppa Road, which heads northwest to Brooklandville and east through Riderwood to the center of Towson. Old Court Road is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector between the Old Court station on the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink and MD 140. History MD 133 westbound past Greenspring Avenue in Pikesville Old Court Road originated as an Indian trail that was repurposed in the late 17th century as a patrol road and defensive perimeter across Baltimore County for rangers based at Fort Garrison to defend English settlements from hostile Indians. In conjunction with the Joppa Road, in the 18th century the path became the cross-county highway to Joppa, the original county seat of Baltimore County, which was located on the Gunpowder River near what is now Joppatowne. The first section of the road built as a modern highway was from Falls Road west to near Park Heights Avenue in Pikesville, which was under construction as a wide macadam road by 1911 and completed by 1915. The macadam road was extended west to Park Heights Avenue in 1923, completing what is today the full length of MD 133. The MD 125 portion of Old Court Road was paved in macadam through Granite in 1924 and relocated and paved in concrete from Granite to the Patapsco River in 1924 and 1925. With the completion of those sections, Old Court Road featured an all-weather surface from the Patapsco River to Towson on both its state-maintained and county-maintained sections. In 1932 and 1933, three sections of the highway were upgraded: MD 133 was extended west and the existing macadam road resurfaced for to U.S. Route 140 (US 140, now MD 140); MD 125 was extended east and resurfaced for to its current eastern terminus; and MD 125 was extended west and resurfaced along Woodstock Road to MD 99. In 1956, four years after the highway's bridge over the Patapsco River was redecked, the Howard County portion of MD 125 was transferred to county maintenance. In 2002, a section of Woodstock Road immediately to the west of the Patapsco River was returned to state maintenance. In 1957, a connector road was built from just east of the eastern terminus of MD 133 to Joppa Road at what is now the latter highway's overpass of I-695 near Riderwood. This connector road, which was briefly a state highway, became part of I-83 in 1962. Old Court Road and Ruxton Road were relocated at I-83; previously the easternmost section of Old Court Road met MD 25 north of MD 133's terminus and Ruxton Road, which prior to 1963 was part of MD 134, met MD 25 south of MD 133's terminus. When Ruxton Road's interchange with I-83 was built, Ruxton Road was realigned to end at the same intersection as MD 133. The current north-south section of Old Court Road east of I-83 was built to replace the disconnected segment to the north. Similar to the situation at MD 25, Old Court Road previously met US 140 at staggered intersections and the westernmost portion of MD 133 was part of Sudbrook Lane. In 1967, Old Court Road was relocated to its present alignment between US 140 and Sudbrook Lane. MD 133 was truncated at MD 129 to bring MD 133 to its current length in 1969.

Characteristics The thallus is filamentous and much branched and may be packed into a mass. It is coenocytic, having multi-nucleate cells consisting of cytoplasm contained within a cylindrical cell wall. There are no septae and the many discoid chloroplasts, nuclei and other organelles are free to move through the organism. The whole organism may consist of a single cell and in the genus Caulerpa this may be several metres across. In the genus Halimeda, whole seabed meadows may consist of an individual, single-celled organism connected by filamentous threads running through the substrate. Reproduction Propagation is normally vegetative from small fragments which grow into new individuals. Under certain conditions sexual reproduction occurs in a process called holocarpy. Almost all of the cytoplasm in the thallus is converted into biflagellate gametes, which are discharged into the sea through papillae. After fertilisation, the zygote becomes a protonema and this in turn develops into a new thallus.Overview of the Genus Caulerpa Proceedings of the International Caulerpa taxifolia Conference, 2002.

Biography Ayermin, was descended from a family settled at Osgodby, Lincolnshire. He was the eldest of three brothers, of whom Richard obtained many ecclesiastical offices, and Adam became archdeacon of Norfolk. In early life William was probably a clerk of the exchequer. Ayermin sat in the Edward II's Parliament at Carlisle for St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury in 1306-7. He also recorded the proceedings of Edward II's parliament at Lincoln in 1316. In August of that year he became master of the rolls and he temporarily performed for many years before and after this date the duties of both the keeper of the great seal and of the chancellor. In 1317 he was made guardian of the Jewish converts' house for life, although previously the office had only been held during the king's pleasure. Tovey's Anglia Judaica, 222. In 1319 Ayermin joined the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Ely, and other ecclesiastics, who with a force of 8,000 men attempted to resist an invasion of the Scots in the North during the First War of Scottish Independence. The army was defeated at the Battle of Myton near the river Swale with great slaughter. William was taken prisoner, and was not released for several months. Around about 26 May 1324 Ayermin resigned the mastership of the rolls to his brother Richard, and became keeper of the king's privy seal. In the church he meanwhile secured much preferment, although he was always manoeuvring to obtain more. He was rector of Wearmouth, and canon of St. Paul's, Lincoln Hereford, Lincoln, York, Salisbury, and Dublin. Ayermin was elected Bishop of Carlisle on 7 January 1325, following the death of John de Halton but was never consecrated as his election was quashed on 13 February 1325 and John Ross was subsequently appointed in his stead.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 235 In July 1325 Ayermin is said by some authorities to have been staying at Rome, to have there received the news of the death of Salmon, bishop of Norwich, and to have straight away obtained Pope John XXII's nomination to the vacant see, regardless of the known intention of Edward II to bestow the bishopric on his chancellor, Robert Baldock. But there seems little doubt that William was living in France at the time, engaged in settling a dispute between the kings of England and France as to the possession of land in Aquitaine. His conduct of this business appears to have displeased Edward II, who had instructed him to offer certain concessions to France, which he failed to do. He had, however, friends at Rome, who undoubtedly obtained for him the papal nomination on 19 July 1325 to the see of Norwich, and he was consecrated on 6 February 1327.Sidney Lee states he was \\"consecrated bishop in France, 15 Sept. 1325, by the pope's agents against Edward's wish\\" . In the course of 1326 year Ayermin returned to England, after frequent refusals to answer the king's summons to explain his recent conduct, he appears to have been reconciled to Edward II ( in spite of the suspicions with which the Despencers and Baldock viewed him) and was acting Keeper of the Great Seal, usually known as the Lord Chancellor of England, from 1326 to 1327. He vigorously supported Edward III on the abdication of Edward II, and held the office of Lord High Treasurer from 1331 to 1332. Ayermin died 27 March 1336, at his house at Charing, near London, and was buried in Norwich Cathedral. In the opinion of Sidney Lee writing in the Dictionary of National Biography the old verdict on his career, which stigmatised him as \\"crafty covetous, and treasonable\\", seems substantially just.

Protoplasma. 181: 233-244. 10.1007/BF01666398See the NCBI webpage on Chlorodendrales. Data extracted from the Prasinophyceae are defined by their cellular scales which are composed of carbohydrates, and Chlorodendrales are unique within this group due to these scales forming a fused thecal wall. Cells of Chlorodendrales are completely covered in scales, which fuse around the cell body producing the theca, but remain individually separated on the flagella, of which there are typically four per cell. Species within Chlorodendrales live in both marine and fresh water habitats, occupying both benthic and planktonic food webs. Additionally, they are photoautotrophs, meaning they produce their own food through the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy. Habitat and ecology Species within Chlorodendrales are found in marine and freshwater ecosystems around the world, including locations such as the salt plains of Goa, India.Arora, M., Anil, A.C., Leliaert, F., Delany, J. and Mesbahi, E. 2013: Tetraselmis indica (Chlorodendrophyceae, Chlorophyta), a new species isolated from salt pans in Goa, India. European Journal of Phycology. 48: 61-78. 10.1080/09670262.2013.768357 Species occupy niches within planktonic and benthic food webs, in which all species are photoautotrophic and have an ecosystem and trophic role similar to land plants in terrestrial environments.Norris, R.E., Hori, T., and Chihara, M. 1980: Revision of the Genus Tetraselmis (Class Prasinophyceae). Bot. Mag. Tokyo. 93: 317-339. 10.1007/BF02488737 Primary producers are consumed by primary consumers such as zooplankton, invertebrate larvae, and heterotrophic protists species. Most species within this group are free-living, however some species have become photosynthetic symbionts in animals; the animal species that can be in symbiosis with Chlorodendrales is limited, due to their need for sunlight for photosynthetic processes. Chlorodendrales populations in natural settings tend to experience extreme fluctuations in population numbers due to seasonal changes in abiotic conditions, such as ambient temperature, the amount of sunlight, and nutrient concentrations. This leads to what has been classified as ‚Äúblooms,‚Äù which is the rapid increase in algae numbers during the spring and autumn months because of high light activity and the turnover of nutrients within the water column. It results from the high amount of sunlight, and the mixing of the water layers which resupplies the upper photosynthetic layer with nutrients, allowing for primary productivity to flourish. Cell morphology Cell shape and size of Chlorodendrales cells varies depending on the species. The cells range greatly in size from species to species, with an upper limit of ~25 ¬µm in length. Cells can be round, ovoid, elliptical, flattened, or compressed; there is great diversity in Chlorodendrales cells. Flagellar and cell-body scales Chlorodendrales scales are unique from other Prasinophyceae lineages because the scales fuse to form a theca, which acts as an exterior protective casing for the cell. All Prasinophyceae lineages produce these external scales within the Golgi apparatus, and secrete the scales via the endomembrane system. Vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi face carry the scales to the cell surface, and upon fusion release the scales to the external cell face. In Chlorodendrales lineages, these scales fuse after secretion to produce the thecal wall, in which individual scales bind by cross-linking to one another. The flagellar scales and the cell body scales are structurally and functionally different, the main difference being the fusion of cell-body scales. The scales also differ in size, shape, and macromolecular composition. The Golgi apparatus is only capable of producing one scale-type at a time, thus, species with multiple scale-types must have different phases of thecal development separated by time and space. This also means that cell body and flagellar scale production occurs separately. Scales used for taxonomic purposes and species identification The thecae of Chlorodendrales species are often unique, and it is an important character for species identification and classification. Thecate features vary greatly from species to species, in which thecae can vary between 1-5 scale layers, in scale shape, in scale size, and in molecular composition/ultrastructure. These thecate features are genetically determined, and thus, they are a consistent and reliable characteristic that will not be influenced by environmental factors. Genera within Chlorodendrales There are two genera within the order Chlorodendrales, Tetraselmis and Scherffelia. Both species are green, photoautotrophs, flagellated, and thecate. The difference between the two genera is the presence or absence of pyrenoids; Tetraselmis contains pyrenoids and Scherffelia does not. Flagella within the two genera are distinct in composition and morphology from species to species, which can be used to infer taxonomy and identification. Both genera produce three types of flagellar scales, in scale combination, and scale patterning, is unique between species. Scales differ mainly in composition and ultrastructure, and these are the main features examined from flagellar scales when identifying species. The increase in knowledge about the morphological and ultrastructural features of flagellar scales, and the ability to identify species as a result, has been due to the development of advanced microscopy and staining techniques. Phylogenetic studies Researchers have collected and analyzed molecular data from 13 prasinophyte taxa to better construct the phylogenetic relationship of early branching green alga.Nakayama, T., Marin, B., Kranz, H.D., Surek, B., Huss, V.A., Inouye, I. and Melkonian, M. 1998: The Basal Position of Scaly Green Flagellates among the Green Algae (Chlorophyta) is Revealed by Analyses of Nuclear-Encoded SSU rRNA Sequences. Protistology. 149: 367-380. 10.1016/S1434-4610(98)70043-4 Phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal-RNA sequence was performed using distance, parsimony, and likelihood statistical tests. The analyses showed four independent prasinophyte groups, in which these lineages represented the earliest divergences among the Chlorophyta. The most parsimonious tree created suggests that the Chlorodendrales lineage is a very early diverging group of ‚Äúcore Chlorophytes,‚Äù of which there are four clades. However, the diverging order of this group remains unclear.

The film highlighted the LCF's involvement in lobbying the British Government on issues such as abortion, gay rights and the enforcing of laws relating to blasphemy. Modell concluded that Williams was \\"a colourful and powerful campaigner for the implementation of radical Christian views\\" and that she \\"believes any law that goes against her strict biblical beliefs must be fought.\\" The programme included footage of Williams' meetings with Conservative politicians Norman Tebbit and Nadine Dorries, both of whom have worked with the LCF to influence policy on matters where they had a common agenda. Williams is reported as stating that the Human Fertilisation Bill was \\"the work of the devil\\", that homosexuality is sinful, that abortion should be illegal, and that the world is just 4,000 years old.

Sales began in November of the Opel Kadett, which would also be sold as the Vauxhall Astra from early 1980 - as General Motors entered the growing front-wheel drive hatchback market, replacing the long-running Viva nameplate. France Peugeot launched a new large family saloon - the 505 - that would eventually replace the long-running and popular 504. It was a more modern-looking car than its predecessor, though it inherited the boxy styling with which Peugeots had been associated for the last decade. 504 production would continue in Europe until 1983 but would last much longer in Egypt. Financially troubled American car giant Chrysler sold its European operations to Peugeot, with British Chrysler and French Simcas now wearing Talbot badges. Renault launched an estate version of its R18 saloon as well as a 5-door version of the R5. Italy Lancia withdrew its Montecarlo sporting coupe from production following criticism of its sub-standard braking system. But the big news of the year was the launch of its Delta family hatchback, which was voted European Car of the Year ahead of the Opel Kadett and Peugeot 505.

The cornerstone of what would later become the residence of the Archbishops of Magdeburg was laid in 1484; the castle was built in the style of the Early Renaissance. Since the end of the 19th century it has housed an arts museum which is recognised as being of national importance. History Origins The history of the Moritzburg is closely connected to that of Halle. In 968, when the Archbishopric of Magdeburg was established by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, he granted the archbishop his Giebichenstein Castle near Halle. Already in the 13th century powerful aristocrats could, by buying privileges, reduce the influence of the sovereign, the Archbishop of Magdeburg, on the town. Thus, Halle had practically reached a state of political autonomy in 1263. The same happened with Magdeburg and when the archbishops finally left Magdeburg, after a series of conflicts with the ever more powerful city council, Giebichenstein Castle became their principal residence in 1382. In the 15th century a group of the important guilds formed an opposition and demanded representation in the city council, which was until then dominated by the urban aristocrats. In 1479, the opposition conspired with the sovereign and opened the gates of the city for the Archbishop's troops. After sparse resistance, Archbishop Ernest II. of Saxony, who was only 14 years of age at the time, moved into the town. As a consequence, the town lost its earlier gained freedoms and it was determined ein festes Schloss zu erbauen, um die Stadt besser in Gehorsam, Unterw√ºrfigkeit und Ruhe zu erhalten: to build a castle in order to gain better control over the town and keep it obedient and quiet. Construction history Construction began promptly with first surveying in April 1479. The search for an adequate location, however, proved difficult due to poor soil conditions. A location was finally found, incorporating the city wall, on the site of the former Jewish settlement northwest of the city. Archbishop Ernest personally laid the cornerstone of his new residence on May 25, 1484 in a ceremonial procession and named the castle Moritzburg after Saint Maurice, the Patron Saint of the country. The Moritzburg still exhibits signs of the late Gothic period; but the almost regular layout, the consistent floor levels and the representative impression of the horizontally emphasized facades show that the castle already belongs to the Renaissance period. The Moritzburg combines the concepts of a fortress with that of a castle, unifying the residence and the defence aspects of the complex. In the beginning, the construction was supervised by Peter Hanschke of East Prussia. Starting from 1533, Andreas G√ºnther, general master builder of the dioceses of Mainz and Magdeburg then created the fortress walls and probably also the round bastions on the east side. The design of the Magdalenenkapelle (Mary-Magdalene Chapel) is attributed to Ulrich von Smedeberg. On May 25, 1503, Archbishop Ernest could move into the imposing castle. His arx insuperabilis (invincible fortress) was financed mainly from the salines of Halle's aristocrats, which had been confiscated in 1479. Total construction cost was announced to be 150,000 Guilders. Early years until the Reformation The reign of the builder, Archbishop Ernest II. of Saxony, was distinguished on the one hand by his victory over Halle in 1479 and, on the other hand, by manifold promotions of his new residence city. His successor Albrecht of Brandenburg, elected in 1513, was at the same time the most splendid and the most tragic sovereign of Halle. As Erzkanzler des Reiches (Archchancellor of the state), cardinal, Archbishop and Prince-elector of Mainz, Archbishop of Magdeburg and Administrator of Halberstadt he -and his favourite residence, the Moritzburg- were in the focal point of European history. In 1517 he called the notorious Dominican friar Johann Tetzel to the Moritzburg and started a limitless sale of indulgences, financing the archbishop's large collection of relics. The collection, which was first housed in the castle's chapel and later moved to the city's cathedral, composed of 353 reliquaries with as much as 21,484 single relics, among these 42 whole bodies of saints, rendering it ideally and materially extremely valuable; it was the most outstanding of its kind in Germany. After the Protestant Reformation Albrecht gave up the city and retreated to Mainz. During the War of Schmalkalden the Moritzburg was occupied by imperial troops. On June 10, 1547 Holy Roman Emperor Charles V moved into Halle upon his victory in the Battle of M√ºhlberg; his military leader, the Duke of Alba, occupied the Moritzburg. Moritzburg and Halle (Saale) as seen from the J√§gerberg hill, around 1855 Talamt, concert at the Moritzburg Thirty Years' War In the Thirty Years' War both the city of Halle and the Moritzburg time and again attracted troops. In October 1625 Wallenstein occupied town and fortress. After the defeat at Breitenfeld, the Count of Tilly moved, pursued by the Swedes, to the Moritzburg as a first retreat. In September 1631 the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus appeared before Halle and could peacefully occupy it for a longer period. Following the Peace of Prague in 1635 the Emperor acknowledged the Duke of Saxony-Wei√üenfels as the new Administrator. On January 6, 1637, under siege by the Swedes, a fire broke out in the castle. All the upper floors of the west and north side as well as the chapel were destroyed, forcing the inhabitants to surrender. On March 19, 1639 Saxon troops blasted the south-western bastion, in turn forcing the - now Swedish - inhabitants to give up, which happened three days later. August, son of the Saxon Prince-elector John George was subsequently appointed the new Administrator. He insisted on vacating the castle of troops to reduce its strategic attraction. A neutrality contract between August and the Swedes kept Halle free from the Thirty Years' War from then on. The Moritzburg was not rebuilt, only the chapel was partly reconstructed as to be used for worship again. The Moritzburg falls to Brandenburg / Prussia With the death of August in 1680, the city of Halle fell to Brandenburg, as designated by the peace treaty of Westphalia. In 1686 the Huguenots of Halle were allowed to use the Gate Tower of the Moritzburg for their religious service. On October 26, 1690 they moved into the Magdalene Chapel. In 1717 the Prussian Anhaltinisches Regiment of about 3,500 soldiers moved into the Moritzburg. In front of the compound a parade ground was established, where Prince Leopold I of Anhalt- Dessau, nicknamed der Alte Dessauer (the Old Dessauer), drilled the troops. In the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) as well as in the late Napoleonic Wars (around 1813), the Moritzburg served as a military hospital. Later, the vaults of the castle were leased to a brewery, while the chapel, which had been used by the French community until 1808, became a storage room. The Prussian government bought the ruins back from the leaseholders in the years from 1847 to 1852, for the sum of 24,800 Thaler. There existed plans for a reconstruction of the complex for the University of Halle by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, but the project was cancelled due to lack of funding. Since 1900, the structural condition of the castle deteriorated dramatically. In 1897 the East, South and West wings were sold to the city of Halle for a new museum. Funded by donations, the Talamt, the southern battlements, the Gate Tower and the South Bastion were reconstructed to house the museum. World War II until present In World War II the deep vaults of the complex served as an air-raid shelter for the Halle citizens and the Gauleitung (Gau administration) of the NSDAP. The cellar was also used to store valuable portals and pieces of the castle architecture. The upper rooms of the West wing were restored between 1951 and 1954. The lower floor of the same housed a restaurant and a small theater since 1964-67. The North-east bastion became a Student Club in 1972. From the 1990s the castle underwent major reconstructions, which were completed in 2008. The architects of the reconstruction, in which the ruined western part of the castle received a modern roof and interior, were Fuensanta Nieto and Enrique Sobejano.Stiftung Moritzburg  Description  The layout is based on an almost regular quadrangle of about 72 by 85 meter side length. The castle was mainly built from quarrystone and was surrounded by a 20 to 25 meter wide and 10 meter deep, once swampy, moat on its southern, eastern and northern side. The western side was protected by a system of staggered walls towards the river Saale. The courtyard was large enough for festivities, processions or tournaments and is heaped up to the level of the city streets West wing Moritzburg, west wing. The West Wing is the main side, the outward side of the castle. The top floors consisted of splendorous halls, whereas the vaults of the upper basement floor, which are today occupied by the museum, most probably housed the rooms of the castle inhabitants. Above, today mostly in ruins, lay two floors of the archbishop's personal and official rooms. In the northern part of the West Wing were the chambers of the sovereign and the library. The staircase in the middle of the courtyard wall is quite noticeable for being one of the first stairways in Germany which is constructed into the building structure and not just applied on the outside. North wing The original main entrance, which can still be recognized by its coat-of-arms frieze, lay in the northern wall but was abandoned in 1616 and consequently blocked up. Above the basement lay two floors, serving as the chambers for officials and as an archive. On the event of the Halle's university's bicentennial in 1894, the north wing was equipped with gym and fencing halls, which were still used for PE lessons up to 1990. The castle's chapel was constructed from 1505 and was dedicated to Mary Magdalene in 1509. Moritzburg, north-east tower. East wing The entrance tower facing the town stands above the eastern wall and housed living rooms and, on the lowest floor, a chapel. To prevent direct shelling of the gates the gateway was constructed in a light curve. The east wing originally consisted of narrow two-floor battlements, the lower floor had open arcades and loop-holes. In 1777 the Baroque, so called Lazarettbau (military hospital) was erected above the eastern foundation walls for the Prussian garrison. The south-eastern bastion was expanded for the museum in 1913. The north-east tower has housed a student club since 1972. South wing The south side of the castle is no longer conserved in its original state. Here were the outbuildings, the chambers of the castle's captain and the vital wells. It is suspected that the stables were also in the south wing. Between 1582 and 1680 the archiepiscopal mint was situated the spacious vaults below courtyard level. The Mary-Magdalene Chapel Moritzburg, inner ward with Mary-Magdalene Chapel. The Moritzburg around 1900 The Maria-Magdalenen-Kapelle (Mary-Magdalene Chapel) has only a small footprint of only 14 by 23 m and a height of 15 m, but seems much more spacious on the inside. A memorial plate of the consecration in 1514 is found on the northern wall and shows the coat of arms of Cardinal Albrecht V of Brandenburg along with Saint Maurice and Mary Magdalene. A separate coat of arms was designed especially for the chapel and placed on the western wall above the gallery. It dates the year of completion as 1509, although the papal confirmation was only received years later. The chapel lost its roof during the Thirty Years' War which would -aside from quick repairs- not be reconstructed before about 200 years later between 1894 and 1899. In 1817 though, the Prussian Crown Prince Frederick William was so impressed by the Moritzburg that he became an official supporter of a reconstruction. On October 23, 1822 the complex including the chapel was designated a protected monument by the Prussian building authorities. The first plans for the reconstruction were made in 1888. Between 1898 and 1899 the chapel was modified to become the university's church on occasion of the university's 200th anniversary. The organ, which was also from the time of the reconstruction, was thoroughly cleaned and altered in its tone structure in 1963. In 1990, a completely new organ was installed in the historical, heritage-protected casing.

It was the band's debut on the Pure Metal Records label. Less commercial than Bride's later works,Gary.Bride - Show No Mercy. The Whipping Post. Retrieved 2007-12-26 the album, which was somewhat more extreme and darker than many contemporary Christian releases, received a mixed reception and did not sell particularly well.Thompson, Dale. Chapter 1. Bridepub. Retrieved 2007-12-26 The band line-up for this album was Dale Thompson (vocals), Steve Osborne (lead guitar), Troy Thompson (guitar, keyboards, violin), Scott Hall (bass), and Stephan Rolland (drums). Recording history After recording four demo tapes as Matrix over the previous three years, brothers Dale and Troy Thompson got their chance when promoter Dorn Repport arranged for Matrix to open for Daniel Band in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. The Thompsons were joined by guitarist Billy Sutherland and drummer Steve Gilbert to perform for a crowd of 1000. Among this crowd were executives from Refuge Music Group. The band caught the label's attention when the band sold out of all the tapes they brought to the show, which led to the label contacting Matrix. Six months later, the band changed its name to Bride and were signed to Pure Metal Records, Refuge Records' Christian metal-focused imprint established specifically to market Bride. Bride's budget to record Show No Mercy was $2500. According to the band, when entering the studio in October 1985, they incorrectly believed it had to meet a release date only a month away. The album ended up rushed, with the production being thin and muddy. Overview Musically, the album features a dark, heavy metal style with occasional speed metal influences and Dale Thompson's high-pitched and pseudo-operatic lead vocals. Troy Thompson and Steve Osborne handled the album's guitar duties. Dale played bass on eight tracks and Scott Hall performed on the remaining two. Stephen Rolland's drum work, based on traditional metal drumming and lacking double bass, would be heard on the band's following releases. The album's opening track, \\"Forever in Darkness,\\" is a fast, rhythm guitar and bass-driven song with an epic chorus. Followed by a minute of lead guitar playing, the song closes hauntingly as Dale repeatedly wails \\"forever in darkness.\\" \\"Follow Your Heart\\" also contains a chorus in which Dale demonstrates a broader vocal range. The song breaks for a brief guitar solo before slowing to several seconds of acoustic guitar. A quiet guitar interlude opens the album's title track, followed by a groovy riff. \\"Show No Mercy\\" takes a slower pace with acoustic guitar playing, and the lyrics deal with spiritual warfare: \\"I am strong and you are weak / Jesus gives me power to defeat / I can't be bought and / won't sell out/ The battle cry is good and loud/ Show no mercy!\\" \\"I Will Be with You\\" starts with spooky keyboards, acoustic guitar, and bass. The song progresses through its verses and reaches its peak at its chorus. \\"Thunder in the City\\" combines a fast combination of piano and rhythm guitar before slowing for its first verse. \\"Thunder in the City\\" progresses aggressively until it peaks at the chorus. \\"No Matter the Price\\" includes some keyboard playing, a brief drum solo, and some melodic rhythm guitar work. The song proceeds slowly through its verses and gains momentum until it reaches an anthemic chorus backed by a powerful guitar riff. Steve Osborne displays virtuosic guitar playing throughout a minute-and-a-half-long instrumental interlude. \\"The First Will Be Last,\\" a mid-tempo track until its chorus, which contains a touch of vocal harmonies, features a passage narrated by a female voice low in the mix, followed by Osborne's sweeping lead guitar work.

The impounded reservoir is Lake Chichester. Location and features Commenced in 1917 and completed in 1926, the Chichester Dam is a minor dam on the Chichester River, a tributary of the Williams River, approximately north of Dungog. The dam contributes about thirty-five percent of the lower Hunter region's water supply. The dam wall is high and is long and was constructed using a cyclopean system of interlocking concrete blocks and large boulders with a volume of . The wall is anchored to the bedrock below it by 93 stressed tendons. At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The spillway is capable of discharging . The surface area of the reservoir is and the catchment area, largely located within the Barrington Tops National Park, is . The dam is connected to reservoirs in Maitland, Cessnock and Newcastle by an long gravitation main. History Land for the water supply scheme was appropriated in the Gazette of 6 October 1916. To safeguard the purity of the water the populated part of the Wangat Valley, including the old goldmining town of Wangat, and the greater portion of the populated part of the Chichester Valley were resumed. The Act appropriated A¬£ as the estimated cost of construction of the dam, with additional funds set aside for land resumption. In 1965 the spillway was lowered by to increase flood capacity. In 1985 the dam was post tensioned with cables and the spillway was relocated to the centre of the dam and returned to its original height. In 1995 the seepage potential was reduced under the northern abutment and in 2003 an improved drainage system for the dam's foundations was installed and the left parapet wall was raised to prevent overtopping in a major flood. Power generation Following a report by the Health Rivers Commission, in 1998 the Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, Craig Knowles, announced that a small hydro-electric power station would be installed in the Chichester Dam in order to generate electricity, reduce greenhouse emissions and allow surplus power to be sold back to the grid.

He began his singing career in 1962 with the film Inqalab and became one of the top male singers in both Urdu and Punjabi films for more than three decades. Early life Masood Rana was born in Mirpur Khas, Sindh, British India on 9 June 1938. He was born in a Rajput land-owning family which had migrated from the East Punjab city of Jalandhar. He started his singing career on Radio Pakistan, Hyderabad, Sindh in 1955 and later helped establish a singing group in Karachi in the early 1960s with the Pakistani film actor Nadeem Baig and a fellow singer Akhlaq Ahmed. Film career Masood Rana got his first breakthrough when the noted Pakistani film actor Saqi introduced him to producer and director Iqbal Shehzad and the film composer Deebo Bhattacharya. His first film song was in the film Inqalab (1962) and the song was Mashriq ki tareek faza mein naya savera phoota hay composed by music director N. K. Rathore. But he gained more popularity from his second film Banjaran (1962) which was composed by music director Deebo Bhattacharya. He was initially introduced as \\"Pakistani Rafi\\" in the Pakistani film circles due to his vocal singing being similar to that of famous Indian singer Mohammed Rafi. Masood Rana initially tried to live up to this reputation and used to copy the famous Indian singer. Later he changed his mind and developed his own style of singing. He specialized in singing difficult songs in very high- pitched voice and was the first choice for music directors for film title and theme songs. In 1964, the Punjabi song Tange Wala Khair Mangda in the film Daachi (1964) was a popular street song composed by veteran music director Ghulam Ahmed Chishti. He then became the most dominating male singer in both Urdu and Punjabi films when his six songs in film Hamarahi (1966) became mega- hits. Masood Rana is still the only male singer in Pakistani films who sang more than 300 songs in each of the two languages - Urdu and Punjabi. He sang in more than 550 films and he worked continuously from his first film in 1962 until his death in 1995. Rana was considered to be the most successful singer after Ahmed Rushdi. Masood Rana also appeared as an actor in a few films but he was not successful in this field. He was a lead actor in film Shahi Faqeer (1970) and a side-hero in films Do Mutiaran (1968) and Yaar Badshah (1971). As a guest actor he was seen in films Sangdil (1968), Do Rangeeley (1972), Noukar Wohti Da (1974), Ajj Di Gall (1975), Khushia (1973) and Dostana (1982).

Early days  The RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine (IAM) was opened on 30 April 1945 by the Princess Royal. It was located on land to the south side of the Farnborough Airfield in Hampshire, and was successor to the wartime RAF Physiological Laboratory. Initially having separate sections for acceleration, altitude, biochemistry, biophysics, personal equipment and teaching, its mandate was to conduct both pure and applied research in support of flying personnel. Initially run by Dr Bryan Matthews, Group Captain Bill Stewart was appointed head in 1946. A former pupil of the Hamilton Academy school, Stewart was to be promoted to Air Vice-Marshal, and awarded CB and CBE.

Additionally, the Institute was responsible for a number of mobile decompression chambers and the training of operators for chambers deployed at certain RAF operational stations with the object of familiarising flying personnel with the effects of anoxia at operational altitudes.  Heyday  The IAM became a world leading centre for aviation medicine research in the 1960s and 1970s, gaining additional facilities, and continuing an active flight research programme that commenced in World War II. Research into protection against the effects of high altitude, high G force, heat and cold stress, noise and vibration, sleep and wakefulness, spatial disorientation, vision, aviation psychology and human error, and aircraft accident investigation dominated activities at the IAM. Much work was done to develop and improve aircrew life support equipment.  Latter history  The IAM ceased to exist in 1994, when many research staff and facilities were transferred to the DERA Centre for Human Sciences. In the RAF, the spiritual successor to the IAM is the RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, which opened in 1998 at RAF Henlow in Bedfordshire, and conducts training and operational support for RAF aircrew.

These were adopted as the arms of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, founded by himAs seen (with bordure engrailed) in a Baroque escutcheon at Trinity Hall, Cambridge (over B staircase), impaled by the arms of the See of Norwich. See image William Bateman (c. 1298 ‚Äì 6 January 1355) was a medieval Bishop of Norwich. Life Bateman was the son of William Bateman, a Norwich citizen and bailiff who was an M.P.. He was born about 1298. He had two elder brothers, both of whom attained eminence. The first-born, Sir Bartholomew Bateman, of Flixton, Suffolk, was knighted by Edward III for his martial prowess in the French wars. The second became an abbot. William, the third son, received his education in his native city, probably in the school attached to the priory of Norwich. He graduated at Cambridge University in Civil and Canon Law. In his thirtieth year, he was collated by Bishop William de Ayreminne to the archdeaconry of Norwich, 8 December 1328. He was introduced by Ayreminne to the court of Pope John XXII at Avignon. The young civilian's ability soon manifested itself, and the pope endeavoured to bind to himself one who seemed likely to fill an influential place in English politics. By his desire, Bateman took up his residence at the Papal Court at Avignon, where he rose through various lucrative and dignified offices until finally, in that or the succeeding pontificate, he was appointed auditor of the palace. He is said to have fulfilled the duties of this office with such inflexible justice and solidity of judgment that he was regarded both by the pope and his court as ‚Äòthe flower of civilians and canonists‚Äô. He retained the same high reputation with John's successor, Benedict XII (1334), by whose provision he was made dean of Lincoln, which dignity we find him holding in 1340. Edward III's wars with France had now begun, and Bateman speedily entered on the long series of diplomatic negotiations which characterised the last decade of his life. Bateman's vigorous mind, business-like habits, and intimate knowledge of law in both its provinces, specially fitted him for diplomatic employment. He was on two occasions despatched from Avignon by the pope to endeavour to effect a reconciliation between the French and English monarchs, and on 20 May 1343 he was empowered, with Hugh Despenser and others, by Edward III to negotiate for a peace with the French ambassadors before Clement VI, the king declaring that he was unable to send a solemn embassage until he had received satisfaction from Philip of Valois for his breaches of the truce. The same year, 19 December, the see of Norwich became vacant by the death of Bishop Antony Beke, and Clement gave Bateman the bishopric by ‚Äòprovision.‚Äô Bateman was consecrated by the pope at Avignon on 23 May 1344. A few months after his consecration, he was commissioned by the king to present letters to Clement for a final peace, and once more to treat with the ambassadors of Philip before the pope as mediator. The limits of this article forbid the attempt to particularise all the repeated and for the most part fruitless negotiations, in the prosecution of which the Bishop of Norwich was during the next ten years repeatedly crossing the sea accompanied by other ambassadors. To do this would be to give a summary of the history of the period. Suffice it to say that we find him thus employed on 28 July, 25 September, and 11 October 1348; 10 March, 13 April 1349; 15 May 1350; 27 June, 26 July 1351; 19 February 1352; 30 March, 28 August, and, finally, 30 October 1354 ‚Äî an embassy in the fulfillment of which he terminated his life. His repeated selection by the king for these difficult and delicate negotiations is an evidence of the confidence reposed in his wisdom, statesmanship, and intimate acquaintance with the tortuous policy of the papal court. On his consecration, Bateman carried out a visitation of his diocese. He asserted his visitatorial authority over the abbey of St. Edmundsbury, which was resisted by the abbot. It was an old quarrel, inherited by both parties from their predecessors. It embittered the first three years of Bishop Bateman's episcopate, and brought him into direct collision with the judicial power. He excommunicated the abbot's attorney. The attorney brought an action against the bishop. A writ of error sued for by the bishop only resulted in the confirmation of the judgment. Bateman, however, repudiated the authority of a temporal court over spiritual persons, and refused either to pay the fine imposed or to absolve the attorney. His cattle and goods were consequently distrained, his temporalities seized, and his person was threatened with arrest. He appealed to the council called by Archbishop John de Stratford at St. Paul's, 25 September 1347, against this invasion of the privileges of the spirituality by the temporal power. How the matter ended appears not to be recorded. The same assertion of his rights was shown in his excommunication of Robert, Lord Morley, the lord-lieutenant of the county, for the crime of poaching on the episcopal manors. He compelled the offender to do public penance. A dispute with the commonalty of Lynn as to certain municipal rights ended in a compromise. In 1349, England was visited by ‚Äòthe black death.‚Äô No part of the country suffered more severely than Norfolk and Suffolk, comprising the diocese of Norwich. The mortality among the clergy was frightful. The annual average of institutions to benefices for the five years from the Lady-days of 1344 and 1349 had been 81. During the year ending Lady- day 1350 the number amounted to 831. The number of clergy swept away in the diocese of Norwich alone cannot be set at less than 2,000. The bishop's brother, Sir Bartholomew Bateman, died in this year, and presumably of the plague. During the whole of this time of pestilence, Bishop Bateman remained unflinchingly at his post, never leaving his diocese for a single day, often instituting as many as twenty clergy at once. Till the plague was stayed, he travelled through his diocese, never staying long in one place, and ‚Äòfollowed by the troops of clergy who came to be instituted to the benefices vacated by death. So many parishes being left without incumbents, there was a fear lest the supply of clergy should be inadequate to the draught upon it. Bishop Bateman applied to Pope Clement VI for direction, who issued a bull authorising him to ordain sixty young men two years under the canonical age, a permission of which he availed himself to a very small extent‚Äô. One important outcome of this appalling calamity was the foundation in the following year, 1350, by Bishop Bateman of the college at Cambridge, to which, as a mark of his special devotion to the blessed Trinity, he gave the name of Trinity Hall. The bishop's object in this foundation, which was designed solely for students of canon and civil law, was to recruit the thinned ranks of the clergy of his diocese with men trained in those studies. For this purpose he became possessor of a hostel which had been purchased by John of Crawden, prior of Ely, as a place to which the monks of his house might retire for study, giving them in exchange six rectories in his diocese. His intention had been to found a master and twenty fellows, besides scholars, who were each to say a prescribed office, ‚ÄòDe Trinitate,‚Äô on rising and going to bed, always to speak Latin, to dispute three times a week on some point of canon or civil law, and have the Holy Scripture read aloud during meals. The royal charter of foundation bears date 20 November 1350. Bateman's death in 1355 prevented the full accomplishment of his scheme. At that time the body consisted only of the master, three fellows, and two scholars. A licence for building a chapel was given by the bishop of Ely on 30 May 1352, to which the founder bequeathed vestments, jewels, and plate. In the list of books given by the bishop to his new college theology is represented only by a small Bible, together with a Compendium and a Recapitulation of the Bible, all the rest being books of canon or civil law. His own private library, however, reverting to the college after his death, was more adequately furnished with theological works. Two years previously, 1348, a clergy- man of Bateman's diocese, Edmund Gonville, rector of Terrington, had obtained licence from Edward III to found a college for twenty scholars in honour of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin. Gonville died before his foundation had been fully established, and had he not named Bishop Bateman as his executor the whole design would probably have collapsed. Bateman carried out Gonville's scheme as a second founder, though with some important changes in its character, 21 Dec. 1351. He removed the college to its present site, near his earlier foundation, and substituted for Gonville's statutes a selection from those of Trinity Hall, by which the requirement of an almost exclusively theological training was abolished. The first Master was Bateman's former chaplain, John Colton, later Archbishop of Armagh. On 17 September 1353 Bateman, as founder of the two societies, ratified an agreement of fraternal affection and mutual help between them ‚Äòas scions of the same stock,‚Äô the precedence, however, being assigned to the members of Trinity Hall, ‚Äòtanquam fratres primogeniti‚Äô. Bateman's interest in the university of Cambridge, in which in his own words he had ‚Äòreceived the first elements of learning, and, though undeservedly, the doctor's degree,‚Äô had been shown at an earlier period by a gift of ¬£100, as a sum from which members of the university might borrow on pledges up to ¬£4. Such donations were at that period not at all rare. The last year of Bateman's busy life was marked by no less than three of those diplomatic missions on which he had so often, and on the whole so fruitlessly, crossed the Channel. He was again commissioned, 30 March 1354, with William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon, and others, to negotiate a final peace with France; and again, on 28 August of the same year, to treat with the French ambassadors before the pope. But Edward's terms were refused by the French king. Once again, and for the last time, 30 October, Bishop Bateman set out on his familiar journey, accompanied by Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Michael Northburgh, bishop of London, to treat before the pope concerning the king's castles and lands in France. The negotiations were prolonged. The new year found the commissioners still at Avignon. The delay was fatal. A sudden sickness, popularly attributed to poison, attacked the bishop, and he died on the festival of the Epiphany, 6 January 1355.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 262 He was buried before the high altar of the cathedral at Avignon, the patriarch of Jerusalem officiating, and the whole body of cardinals attending the obsequies with the exception of one detained by illness. Trinity Hall still preserves their founder's cup and cover of silver-gilt, bearing his arms. An image of the Trinity in a tabernacle, silvergilt, given by him to the high altar of Norwich Cathedral, as well as a smaller one, shared the fate of superstitious images at the Reformation.

He was himself executed, allegedly for refusing to carry out a death sentence on Poles, making him a symbol of pacifism and Austrian resistance to National Socialism. The truthfulness of the story has been disputed, with critics arguing that the story is not based on any reliable documents and is a fabrication. Early life Otto Schimek was born in Vienna, the thirteenth child of Rudolph and Maria (n√©e Zsambeck). The family had fallen into hard times during the Great Depression, and was further pushed into poverty by the death of Rudolph Schimek, who had been the primary breadwinner, in 1932. After his father's death, Otto neglected his school duties in favor of helping his mother, a dressmaker, bring enough money in to feed the large family. According to his sister, Elfrida Kujak, Otto was not particularly religious as a child. However, he would go to church every Sunday with his mother. Later, after being drafted to the Wehrmacht, he carried a cross with him at all times. His work with his mother consumed most of his time, and he did not have too many friends. However, the family's neighbors spoke highly of him, and on the way to the army unit, he was allegedly bid farewell by the whole condominium located on Obere Augartenstrasse. Wehrmacht duties Schimek was seventeen years old when he was drafted. He initially served in Bosnia, and was later moved to southern Poland. As Elfrida Kujak stated after the war, while on leave some time in 1943 or early 1944, Otto told her that he did not want to kill anybody, and that he would raise his gun above heads of enemies. \\"My conscience is clear\\" - Schimek allegedly said. \\"I will not shoot people. These people want to return home just like me. This war is not Christian.\\" This behavior was swiftly noted by the Army authorities. Schimek was warned, and then put in prison. He managed to escape and tried to return to Vienna, but was caught somewhere in Czechoslovakia. Severely beaten, Otto faced court martial for desertion, but was given a final chance. Firing squad Wehrmacht authorities decided that Schimek would be included in a firing squad. His task was to kill a Polish family from the area between Tarn√≥w and Dƒôbica - a father, mother and two sons, who had been caught preparing food for soldiers of the Home Army. Otto firmly refused, stating that he would not kill innocent people in Hitler's war. His superiors' reaction was quick, and Schimek was immediately sentenced to death for cowardice and desertion. Elfrida Kujak later said that when news about the sentence reached his family, Otto's mother wrote a letter to Berlin, pleading for clemency. It was too late. A few hours before the execution, Schimek wrote a letter to his brother, stating: \\"I am in a happy mood. What do we have to lose? Nothing, only our poor lives, as they cannot kill our souls. What a hope! Today, I am going to heaven, where the Father is waiting. May God guard you so that you will join me\\". Death Schimek was executed on the morning of November 14, 1944. The exact location of his execution is unknown. It has only been established that it took place in the village of Lipiny, southeast of Tarn√≥w. Afterwards, the locals were reportedly allowed to pick up his body. He was reportedly buried in the cemetery in the village of Machowa, located halfway between Tarn√≥w and Dƒôbica. An exhumation carried out in the 1990s proved that the man buried in his alleged grave was actually much older at time of death. It is now believed that Schimek was actually buried alongside other Wehrmacht soldiers at the war cemetery in ≈Åƒôki Dolne. The tomb Some regard Schimek's symbolic tomb in Machowa as an object of pilgrimage. A nearby tablet reads \\"Born in 1925, executed in 1944, because he did not want to shoot the Poles. May God take you in his mercy\\". Many people visit the grave to lay flowers and light candles in his memory. Polish and Austrian flags can also be seen on it. These visits became controversial in the late 1980s, when the anarcho-pacifist organization \\"\\" (Freedom and Peace, WiP), on November 17, 1985, used the anniversary of Schimek's death to announce their \\"Declaration of Principles\\". WiP activists were stopped on their way to the cemetery. Communist militia in Tarn√≥w detained fourteen of them for several hours. On May 4, 1986, a march to Schimek's grave to commemorate his birth resulted in the detention of fifty activists. In 1993, Telewizja Polska (Polish Television) made a 40-minute documentary movie entitled Casus: Otto Schimek. Controversy A 2013 article in Polish magazine Wprost, drawing on the finding of Austrian journalist Martin Pollack and writer Christoph Ransmayr, disputes most facts forming the core of Schimek's story. It notes that there are no documents confirming the story, and no witnesses outside of second-hand testimony of Schimek's sister, Elfrida Kujak. Schimek's story, popularized in Austria and Poland in the 70s, has been debunked and forgotten in Austria by the 80s, through it is still repeated in Poland.

Plot Happy Days tells us a story that explores the lives of eight friends through the four years of their engineering course. Each one of them joins Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology with their own set of idiosyncrasies, eccentricities, beliefs and ideals. What starts off as a journey of individuals, slowly becomes a collective one over time. They bond over as they go through bullying seniors, stringent professors, intense examinations, over the top celebrations, love, betrayal, sacrifice and every other possible emotion that an individual can experience in a college. The movie portrays the mindset of a typical engineering student which helped youth to connect with the characters involved. The film is a hyperbolic representation of a student's life.

The main lead of the film was selected using the internet without any direct audition. Varun Sandesh did not audition for his role. He sent his photograph by e-mail in response to idlebrain.com advertisement and subsequently sent a video clip of himself enacting certain scenes along with a song via Google Video. Damidi Kamalakar Reddy, founding Secretary and Treasurer of Chaitanya Engineering College, acted as a Professor/Lecturer in a brief cameo role. Location Most of the movie was shot at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT) and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology MGIT. In fact, the opening scene between Appu and Rajesh was shot in MGIT with select scenes shot outdoors. Sekhar is an alumnus of CBIT, and he found it to be a suitable location. He had to arrange a special screening of Anand to the chairman of CBIT and its board members to convince them for an on-site shoot. Apparently, after watching Anand, the board granted their permission to shoot the film. Cost cutting measures Sekhar Kammula cut costs of producing the film through various methods. By casting newcomers, he cut expenses to a reasonable level. As most of the shooting took place in the college, there was no need to construct sets. By partnering with Pantaloon Group, he saved another Rs 1 million in the costumes budget. Release Happy Days was released on 28 September 2007 in the United States and 2 October 2007 in India.

The club was founded in the small town of Nisou near the city of Nicosia in 1981, following the merge of Erithros Asteras (Red Star) and Proodos (Progress). The colors of the team are red and white. The club currently competes in the Cypriot Second Division. History Establishment Pera Chorio-Nisou community consists of 2 neighboring villages, Nisou and Pera Chorio. In 1958, the first sports club in Pera Horio was founded under the name Athletic Youth Club (Œë.Œü.Œù.). A few months after the founding of the club came to Cyprus for friendly matches Red Star Belgrade, an important and well known team of the time in Europe. The AO.N. hosted the Red Star at her club and for that reason, in 1959, it was decided to rename the club to Erythros Asteras (Red Star). At the same time, at Nisou was established the club Proodos (Progress). Both teams were part of the same federation of rural football, The Federation of Nicosia (POEL), in which the Erythros Asteras was one of founding members and were competing at the same league. There was rivalry between the two teams. In 1979, it was decided to merge the two groups, which took place in 1980. The new club was named Mikti Erithrou Astera Proodou (MEAP). From the first period, the united team claimed its promotion to the third division, but lost to the semi-finals of the STOK championship. Early years In the early years, the presence of the MEAP in the agricultural championship that participated was moderate. In 1984, the fourth division was formed, involving associations from the agricultural federations, following the suggestions of the federations themselves. For political reasons, POEL did not propose MEAP, although at that time it had won the championship of the federation, the championship of the championships and had reached the semifinals of the STOK championship. However, in the following period the club secured its promotion through the STOK championship. Period 1986‚Äì1999 In 1986, the club promoted in the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) as a fourth division member. From 1986 to 2000 it participated in the fourth division. 2000‚Äì2009 decade In the 1999‚Äì00 season won the fourth division championship and also the climbing ticket in the third division. There were 4 consecutive appearances third division championship, where the team finished in positions in the first half of the table, culminating in the 2003‚Äì04 season that secured the second place and the promotion in the second division. In second division the team participated for six consecutive seasons. In the 2005‚Äì06 season it finished in 6th place, the highest position in its history. The next period, it reached the round of 16 of the Cypriot Cup, which is its best proceeding in the competition. 2010‚Äì decade In the 2009‚Äì10 season the club ranked 14th and in the last position of the championship and was relegated to the third division. There was another relegation to the fourth division in the following season. It remained for two periods in fourth division. In the 2012‚Äì13 season won the championship and gained the promotion to third division. The following season finished fifth in the championship. In the 2014‚Äì15 season finished in 4th place, just two points behind the third place leading to the second division. In the 2017‚Äì18 season finished in second place of the championship, ensuring its return to the second division.

It is the band's second album to be released on the label Pure Metal Records in 1988. Live to Die is considered by critics to be the band's finest release in its metal era. Songs such as \\"Hell No\\" and \\"Heroes\\" have become Christian metal anthems and were popular songs in the band's concerts. Recording Live to Die saw Bride adding elements of speed and thrash metal to its output. The compositions reflect a more mature song writing in some of their more well-known tracks such as \\"Hell No\\", \\"Whiskey Seed\\", and \\"Heroes\\". The vocalist Dale Thompson continues to display a high-pitched, pseudo-operatic vocal style. The album is characterized by the dual guitar work and harmonies by Troy Thompson and Steve Osborne, highlighted on the songs \\"Fire and Brimstone\\" and \\"Heroes\\". On this album, the drummer Stephen Rolland began playing precise double bass technique. Frank Partipilo replaced Scott Hall on bass. Live to Die also shows a more advanced production compared to that of Show No Mercy. Overview The opening track \\"Metal Might\\" is a more power metal type double bass driven song, followed by the Christian metal anthem \\"Hell No\\", known for its chorus with a catchy hook. The lyrics of \\"Hell No\\" talk about sailors trying to stay afloat at stormy seas as a metaphor for struggling in life: \\"The storm is screaming with vengeance to kill/ Faith has plunged into the sea beneath/ Waves beat the ship with iron first to sink/ We won't go to hell, no we won't go.\\" \\"In the Dark\\" takes off at an upbeat tempo to an edgy rhythm guitar only to slow to an acoustic guitar for its first verse. The song contains a short interlude reminiscent of jazz fusion. \\"Out for Blood\\" is about Judas betraying Christ: \\"You're just a kiss away from your destiny/ Just a word away from deceiving a friend/ Judas kiss, Judas kiss/ Out for blood, you're out for blood.\\" The title track begins with and aggressive guitar driven output moving to an epic feel. The meaning behind \\"Live to Die\\" is about salvation: \\"I won't be the one to say/ That you don't need religion/ But without a Savior/ There's no chance to be forgiven.\\" The thrash metal influenced riff at the beginning of \\"Fire and Brimstone\\" gives the track an aggressive feel. It features some virtuoisic dual lead guitar work by Troy Thompson and Steve Osborne. \\"Whiskey Seed\\" takes a stance on alcoholism: \\"So you want/ to drink/ Because it makes you feel big/ Pour it down, I'll break you like a little twig/ You're so young, but you want to feel so old/ The only way to be hot, gain the world and lose your soul.\\" \\"Here Comes the Bride\\" takes a speed metal approach, and the song speeds up to a fast pace with a double bass driven riff. \\"Heroes\\" is a seven-minute epic songs about the fight between good and evil. The song starts with a narration reminiscent of horror movies accompanied by organ playing. \\"Heroes\\" progresses to the point when Troy Thompson and Steve Osborne play together for over a minute of rhythm guitar harmony. The song progresses through its first verse at a double bass driven mid-tempo pace until it reaches an anthem type peak.

As a young man he studied at Oxford University and held numerous positions in the English Church. He fought in Italy before being consecrated as a bishop in 1370. Parliament agreed to allow Despenser to lead a crusade to Flanders in 1383, which was directed against Louis II of Flanders, a supporter of the antipope Clement VII. The crusade was in defence of English economic and political interests. Although well funded, the expedition was poorly equipped and lacked proper military leadership. After initial successes, a disastrous attempt to besiege the city of Ypres forced Despenser to return to England. Upon his return he was impeached in parliament. His temporalities were confiscated by Richard II of England, but were returned in 1385, the year he accompanied the king northward to repel a potential French invasion of Scotland. Despenser was an energetic and able administrator who staunchly defended his diocese against Lollardy. In 1399, he was among those who stood by Richard, following the landing of Henry Bolingbroke in Yorkshire towards the end of June. He was arrested for refusing to come to terms with Bolingbroke. The following year, he was implicated in the Epiphany Rising, but was pardoned. Birth and ancestry Henry le Despenser was the youngest son of Edward le Despenser (1310‚Äì1342), by his wife Anne Ferrers (died 1367),DNB daughter of Sir Ralph Ferrers of Groby. Henry was born around 1342, the year that his father was killed at the siege of Vannes.DNB (1900) He and his three brothers all grew up to become soldiers. His eldest brother Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le DespencerBurke, B. (1814‚Äì1892), A genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the peerage and baronetage of the British Empire (1869) p.670 online version (around 1335‚Äì1375) was reputed to be one of the greatest knights of his age: he and Henry fought together for Pope Urban V in his war against Milan in 1369. Comparatively little is known of his other siblings: Hugh le Despenser fought abroad and died in Padua in March 1374, Thomas fought in France and died unmarried in 1381 and Gilbert le Despenser died in 1382. Their sister Joan was a nun at Shaftesbury Abbey until her death in 1384. The le Despenser family originated from the lords of Gomi√©court in north-eastern France. Henry's grandmother Eleanor de Clare was a granddaughter of Edward I of England. Henry's great-grandfather Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester (1262‚Äì1326) and grandfather Hugh Despenser the Younger (1286‚Äì1326), who was a favourite of Edward II, were both exiled and later executed after the rebellion of Queen Isabella and her lover Mortimer against Edward II. Hugh le Despenser had become Edward II's adviser, holding power until the king's defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn, but he was later restored to favour. His son was appointed the king's chamberlain and enjoyed a still larger share of royal favour. The barons were hostile to the Despensers, due to their acquired wealth and perceived arrogance, and in 1321 they were banished.The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 8, Slice 2 On-line version Their sentences were soon afterwards annulled and from 1322 they played an important role in the governing of the country, but in 1326 Isabella acted against them and both men were tried and executed. In 1375, Despenser's nephew Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester succeeded his father Edward. Thomas was captured and killed following the attempt to restore Richard II in the Epiphany Rising. Early career In 1353 (as an eleven- year-old boy) Henry 'de Exon' became the canon of Llandaff\\"Henry de Exon 1353-?, By exch. with Geoffrey de Cornasano for a canonry with reservn. of preb. in Lanchester colleg. ch., co.

By the age of nineteen he had become the rector of BosworthDNB and by February 1361 he was a master at Oxford University, studying civil law. He was ordained on 17 December 1362. By 20 April 1364 he was archdeacon of Llandaff. Of his early life Capgrave tells us that he spent some time in Italy fighting for Urban V in his war against Milan in 1369: Bishop of Norwich In 1370 Despenser, then the canon of Salisbury, was appointed as Bishop of Norwich by a papal bull dated 3 April 1370. He was consecrated at Rome on 20 April and returned to England. He received the spiritualities of his see from the Archbishop of Canterbury on 12 July 1370 and the temporalities from the king on 14 August.Fasti ecclesiae Anglicanae, p.465 Involvement in the suppression of the Peasants' Revolt The site of the Battle of North Walsham During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, rebels from Kent and Essex marched to London and, once admitted to the city, managed to capture the Tower of London. Richard, who had promised to agree to all the demands of the peasants, met the rebels outside the city, where the leader of the peasants Wat Tyler was killed and the rebellion was ended. The king's promises were retracted. The rebellion quickly spread to other parts of England, including the diocese of Norwich, where it lasted for less than a fortnight. On 14 June a group of rebels reached Thetford and from there the insurrection spread over south-western Norfolk towards the Fens. At the same time the rebels, led by a local dyer, Geoffrey Litster, moved across the north-eastern part of the county, urging insurrection throughout the local area. Over the next few days, the rebels converged on Norwich, Lynn and Swaffham. Norwich, then one of the largest and most important cities in the realm, was taken and occupied by Litster and his followers, who caused considerable damage to the property and possessions of their enemies once they managed to enter the city. The Norwich rebels then travelled to Yarmouth, destroying legal records and landowners' possessions; other insurgents moving across north-east Norfolk destroyed court rolls and taxation documents; there were numerous incidents of pillage and extortion across the whole county. Despenser first heard news of the rising in his own diocese at a time when he was absent at his manor of Burley in Rutland, west of Norwich. Armed, he hastened back to Norfolk via Peterborough, Cambridge and Newmarket, with a company of only eight lances and a small body of bowmen. His followers increased on the way, and by the time he reached North Walsham, near the Norfolk coast, he had a considerable force under his command. There he found the rebels entrenched and defended by makeshift fortifications. According to Thomas Walsingham, in the Battle of North Walsham the bishop himself led the assault and overpowered his enemies in hand-to-hand fighting. Many were slain or captured, including the rebels' leader, who was hanged, drawn and quartered soon afterwards. Despenser personally superintended Litster's execution. In the following months he proceeded to deal with other rebels in his diocese. But the rigour with which he put down the rebellion made him highly unpopular in Norfolk and in the following year a plot was organised to murder him. The scheme was betrayed in time by one of the conspirators, and the plotters were dealt with by the authorities.Knighton, Chronicle Following his successful crushing of the rebellion, Despenser commissioned a reredos to sit on the altar in St Luke's chapel, Norwich Cathedral illustrating scenes from Christ's final days. His intention may have been to remind the peasantry to accept their lot in life as Christ had done. The Norwich Crusade of 1383 A map of Flanders and northern France during the 1383 campaign in Flanders, including the main area affected by the crusaders Soon after Urban VI had been elected pope in 1378, Robert of Geneva was elected as a rival pope, taking the name Pope Clement VII and removing himself to Avignon. The so-called Western Schism subsequently caused a great crisis in the Church and created rivalry and conflict throughout Christian Europe. It was eventually resolved as a result of the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418). In the autumn and winter of 1382, Flanders had been invaded by Charles VI of France. Philip Van Artevelde had fallen at the Battle of Roosebeke and the country had been compelled to submit to the French king, who obliged all the conquered towns to recognise Clement VII. In response to events in Flanders, Pope Urban issued bulls for the proclamation of a crusade, choosing Bishop Despenser to lead a campaign against the followers of Clement VII in Flanders. He granted Despenser extraordinary powers for the fulfillment of his mission and plenary indulgence to those who should take part in or contribute support to it. Both the commons and King Richard II were enthusiastic about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, for political and economic reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French. On 6 December 1382, Richard ordered the crusade to be published throughout England. Later that month the bishop and his men took the cross at St. Paul's Cathedral. In February 1383 Parliament, after hesitating in entrusting the mission to a churchman, ultimately assigned to him the subsidy which it had granted the king in the previous October for carrying on the war in Flanders.Walsingham, Hist. Angl. ii. 84 The king's only stipulation was that the crusaders should await the arrival of William Beauchamp before launching offensive operations against the French and their allies. The bishop issued mandates for the publication of the bullsWalsingham, Hist. Angl. ii. 78 et seq.; Knighton, p. 2673 et seq. and the archbishop did the same.Wilkins, Concil Magn√¶ Brit. iii. 176-8 The enterprise was ardently seconded by the friars and contributions of immense value were made from all quarters, but especially, according to Henry Knighton,Knighton. p. 2671 from \\"the rich ladies of England\\". The English landed at Calais in May 1383 and proceeded to attack Gravelines, which was in the hands of the French. Gravelines, Dunkirk and the neighbouring country (including the towns of Bourbourg, Bergues, Poperinghe, and Nieuport) soon fell. On 25 May the crusaders put to flight a Franco-Flemish army, under the command of the Count of Flanders, in a pitched battle fought near Dunkirk.Westminster Chronicle On- line version Knighton On-line version Despenser was then persuaded by his followers to attempt to besiege Ypres, which was to prove to be the turning point of the crusade. He was unwilling to attack the city but his Gantois allies and some of his officers insisted that Ypres should be taken. Ypres during the Bishop of Norwich's siege. The illustration, a reproduction of an engraving published in 1610, shows the siege in progress. The inhabitants of Ypres were well prepared for a siege by the time the English and their allies arrived and attacked the city on 8 June 1383. Dwellings in the outlying suburbs had been abandoned; the timber from them was used to strengthen the earth ramparts and the stone gates of the city. A mission had been dispatched to Paris to replace artillery powder stocks. The city was well organised under the command of the Castellan of Ypres, John d'Oultre, and had been divided into different defensive sectors. Although the ramparts were low, they were well protected with a double wet ditch, a high thorny hedge reinforced with stakes and a wooden stockade and fire-step. The English attacked the Temple Gate on the first day but were beaten off. Over the next three days the city gates were attacked simultaneously, without success. Before the end of the first week of the siege, reinforcements arrived to completely encircle the city walls and the outer ditch was breached using soil. On the eighth day (15 June) Despenser attacked the defences with artillery, firing on the Messines Gate and damaging it, but not enough to cause the city defences to be breached. Over the following days of the siege, sustained artillery attacks had little overall effect and the assaults of Despenser's troops were all beaten off. An attempt to drain the ditches seriously threatened the Yprois, but the attempt was unsuccessful and the besieged managed to communicate with the Duke of Burgundy through Louis le M√¢le, who was able to raise a large French army to come to the aid of the city. On 8 August, after eight weeks of effort, Despenser abruptly decided to abandon the siege, leaving his allies to continue on their own. After the d√©b√¢cle at Ypres, the bishop's forces divided, some going back to England, some remaining with the bishop and others under Sir Thomas Trivet and Sir Hugh Calveley retiring to Bourbourg and Bergues. The bishop and Calveley had wished to advance into France, but Sir William Elmham, Trivet and some of the other commanders refused to go. The bishop, after entering Picardy for some distance, was obliged to fall back upon Gravelines. It turned out that the French had little stomach for a showdown with the English and their allies, preferring instead to negotiate: part of the French army was unwilling to fight when Despenser and Calveley encountered it when moving towards Picardy. It is possible that had King Richard crossed the Channel with a large English army, the campaign would have ended in a famous victory. However, for the demoralised and disease-ridden English forces, the arrival of the French headed by the boy-king Charles was decisive. Charles had taken the oriflamme on 2 August and his army was mustered in Arras on 15 August. They advanced into Flanders, reaching Th√©rouanne by the end of August, Drincham on 5 September, Bergues on 7 September (forcing Trivet's and Elmham's retreat to Bourbourg and Gravelines) and Dunkirk on 9 September. Bourbourg was besieged on 12 September: two days later the Duke of Brittany persuaded the French to negotiate a surrender and the English garrison was given safe conduct from the town. The French army then proceeded along the coast and besieged Gravelines. There, without Despenser's authority, the defenders accepted bribes and the bishop's treasurer pocketed 5000 francs. Despenser at first refused the surrender terms, but a few days later Gravelines was evacuated and Despenser ordered it to be sacked. By the end of October the remaining crusaders had returned across the English Channel. Career after 1383 Norwich Cathedral, one of the great Norman buildings of England. Henry le Despenser is buried in front of the high altar. Soon after returning from Flanders, the bishop was impeached in parliament, on 26 October 1383, in the presence of the king. The chancellor Michael de la Pole accused him of not mustering his troops at Calais, as had been agreed; not recruiting a high enough number of armed men; refusing to certify properly who his military leaders were; deceiving the king by not allowing a secular lord to command the expedition to Flanders; and disbanding his forces prematurely. Despenser denied all the charges, insisting that enough men had assembled at Ypres, that he had chosen his commanders well and that he had not refused to obey the king's orders. After de la Pole declared the bishop's replies to be insufficient, Despenser requested another hearing to defend himself still further, which was granted. In this hearing Despencer proceeded to blame his own commanders for forcing him to retreat from Ypres and then evacuate the garrisons. All his arguments were refuted and he was blamed for the failure of the expedition. His temporalities were confiscated and he was ordered to repay any costs taken from money gained from the French. Despenser's fall from grace did not last long. Following Scottish incursions into England, it was decided that the 18-year-old King Richard should lead an army into Scotland, marking the start of his military career.Oxford DNB 'Richard II' In 1385 every magnate of consequence, including Despenser, joined the immense host that advanced north with the king, The English army reached Edinburgh, which was sacked, but then retreated back to England, despite John of Gaunt's wish to go on to Fife. The Scottish campaign was one of the last times that Despenser marched with an army. The ruins of Despenser's manor house at North Elmham, built over the site of the ancient Saxon cathedral and a Norman chapel Henry le Despenser continued to be controversial after his fighting career was over, mainly because of the vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges. For over a decade Despenser was involved in disputes with the chapter of Norwich Cathedral and with other religious communities in his diocese, mainly concerning the bishop's right to intervene in their internal affairs. In 1394 the monks appealed successfully to Pope Boniface IX against Despenser, but in 1395 matters were still not resolved, for that year the pope ordered William Courtenay the Archbishop of Canterbury to assist in mediating between the parties. On Richard II's instruction, the bishop and the convent instead appeared before Archbishop Courtenay and a royal council, but Courtenay's death in July 1396 prevented a resolution of the dispute from being finalised until 1398, when a royal commission decided in favour of Despenser. Pope Boniface annulled the decisions of the commission in 1401, after the convent appealed to him, but the papal sentences were ignored by Despenser. Eventually the monks came to terms with the bishop and accepted a loss of their autonomy.Norwich Cathedral p.297 Fighting Lollardy The execution of William Sawtrey Since 1381, there had been a growing fear of Lollardy among the English political elite. The Lollards had first appeared in the 1370s and had briefly found favour with the upper classes, but in 1382 power was given for the authorities to detain heretics and examine them in a Church court. During the second half of his reign Richard II became steadily more determined to maintain religious orthodoxy and acted increasingly harshly to suppress the Lollards. His successor Henry IV went even further, introducing the death penalty for heresy and for possession of a bible. Despenser took active steps to maintain orthodoxy in his own diocese. Walsingham praised Henry's actions against the Lollards and contrasted him with his fellow bishops: Henry however appears not to have dealt too savagely in dealing with heretics. On 1 May 1399, William Sawtrey, a Norfolk curate and a Lollard, was examined before him. Sawtrey recanted his heresies in public and apparently received no serious punishment, but after moving to London, Sawtrey's heretical preaching attracted the attention of Archbishop Thomas Arundel and he was summoned to appear before a convocation at St. Paul's. Despenser did not attend but sent a written memorandum on 23 February. Following his trial Sawtrey was condemned as a relapsed heretic and was burned in chains at Smithfield in 1401. Final years Upon the death of John of Gaunt on 3 February 1399, his son Henry became the Duke of Lancaster, but Richard II moved quickly to strip him of his patrimony. Bolingbroke resolved to return to England from ParisHistory of England p.7 to claim the restoration of his family estates and in July 1399 he disembarked at Ravenspur. Henry le Despenser reacted to these events by standing loyally by Richard. On 2 July he commissioned three vicars-general to deputise for him whilst he was absent from the diocese and by 10 July he had reached St. Albans with reinforcements for the Duke of York's army. There he joined up with York and they travelled to join the king as he returned from Ireland, whilst Bolingbroke moved south towards Bristol to intercept Richard's supporters. Despenser was with York at Berkeley Castle when he came to terms with Bolingbroke at the end of July, but the bishop refused to submit and was arrested and briefly imprisoned.Chronique de la trahison et mort de Richart II, p.292 On 30 September Bolingbroke was proclaimed king in London, an event that Despenser may have witnessed. The bishop attended the first parliament of the new reign on 6 October 1399, in which it was agreed that King Richard should be imprisoned. After this time Despenser's influence in his diocese seems to have diminished, power having shifted to Sir Thomas Erpingham.DNB (1900) Henry was implicated in the abortive Epiphany Rising of January 1400, during which his nephew Thomas, Earl of Gloucester played a key part and was subsequently executed. Thomas had been created Earl of Gloucester by Richard II, but in 1399 was accused of being involved in the death of the son of the Duke of Gloucester and as a result lost his earldom. He joined in the conspiracy of the earls of Rutland, Kent and Huntingdon and was with their army at Cirencester, when they were attacked by the townsmen, who burnt Thomas le Despenser's lodgings. Thomas fled, boarding a ship, but the captain forced him to Bristol, where on 13 January Chronicles of the revolution, 1397‚Äì1400: the reign of Richard II By Chris Given-Wilsonp.xv he was released to the mob and beheaded at the high cross.DNB 1900 In the aftermath of the rebellion Henry le Despenser appointed John Derlington, the archdeacon of Norwich, as his vicar-general on 5 February 1400 and then submitted himself to the custody of Archbishop Arundel who accompanied him to Parliament on 20 January 1401.DNB There his enemy Sir Thomas Erpingham falsely accused him of being involved in the plot. He was finally reconciled to Henry IV when the king granted him a pardon in 1401. Despenser died on 23 August 1406, and was buried in Norwich Cathedral before the high altar. A brass inscription dedicated to him was placed there, but has since been destroyed.

Born in Inverness, Scotland, MacDonald was educated at the Farraline Park Institution there, and would serve later as the constituency's MP from 1922 until 1950. A civil engineer by profession starting in 1890, MacDonald would work in British Egypt from 1898 to 1921. He established the firm of consulting engineers which eventually practiced under the name of Sir M MacDonald & Partners from 1927. In 1932, he became President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.Murdoch MacDonald, obituary, The Engineer, 3 May 1957 Engineering career MacDonald served his apprenticeship as an engineer with the former Highland Railway Company, and following its completion he spent some years as an assistant engineer on various railway construction projects in Northern Scotland. Among them, there was the building of the Black Isle line between 1890 and 1894, and the widening of the main line between Dalnaspidal and Blair Athol. Years later, MacDonald noted that his early railway work included the design and construction of a small earthen dam and hydroelectric plant. In 1898, he was invited by Benjamin Baker to go to Egypt as assistant engineer to Maurice Fitzmaurice, the resident engineer in charge of constructing the first Aswan Dam. MacDonald's appointment as an assistant engineer during the building of this significant structure marked the beginning of a 23-year term of service in Egypt. During the same dam's first heightening between 1908 and 1912, MacDonald was director-general of irrigation for the Egyptian Government. He subsequently became Under Secretary of State for Public Works, and finally adviser to Egypt's Minister of Public Works. For most of his years in Egypt, MacDonald's principal work was with the Aswan Low Dam and its first heightening. The initial dam provided storage capacity above the Nile's natural flow, for Egyptian agriculture requirements, and was capable of holding a summer water supply for lands reasonably expected to be converted to summer irrigation in the immediate future. By 1905 however, it appeared that Egypt was experiencing a cycle of low years in regard to the volume of water passing down the river during the summer. The Government was thus very soon faced with the problem of finding additional storage room to meet possible demands for the existing area, as well as making adequate provision for future extension. A scheme for thickening and heightening the existing Aswan Dam was prepared by Benjamin Baker, and a great deal of the work involved was undertaken by MacDonald. The project was brought to fulfillment principally under his direction, with the \\"first heightening\\" completed in 1912. There were, however, several other projects initiated by Sir Murdoch during his years of service with the Egyptian Government. He was responsible for the planning and completion of overall drainage schemes for lower Egypt which finally dealt with about 3,000,000 acres. He also designed the Sennar Dam on the Blue Nile, and put into operation the first stages of the Gezira irrigation schemes for the conversion of virgin land in the Sudan for cotton growing. MacDonald worked on the initial siting and design of Gebel Aulia Dam, which was built upstream in the Sudan, but also provided 4 billion cubic metres of regulated storage annually for irrigation downstream in Egypt. He designed and constructed the head works of the Menufia Canal, downstream of the Delta Barrage, the Esna Barrage downstream of Aswan, and effected large- scale improvements to Alexandria Harbour. But even in the 1910s, the propagation of many of these schemes for the development of Egypt aroused much controversy. One expert commission after another was set up to examine the projects and investigate the criticisms of them, and it was in this connection that MacDonald prepared a detailed report entitled Nile Control, which is looked upon as an early valuable guide to the effective water resource management of the Nile. Following his departure from Egyptian service and starting Sir M. MacDonald & Partners, he continued his work on Egyptian irrigation schemes. The firm was invited to submit proposals for a second heightening of the Aswan Dam, and the work was carried out between 1929 and 1933. About the same time, MacDonald was responsible for work undertaken to strengthen the Esna Barrage, and he advised on various schemes for land drainage and irrigation in Greece and Portugal. After World War II, he was again consulted by the Government of Egypt about the Aswan Dam, and submitted a report advising that a third heightening was practicable, though never carried out. Between 1951 and 1953, he was engaged on the design of four new schemes, for the Egyptian Government, involving barrages and storage reservoirs on the Nile. Despite advancing years, he twice visited Egypt to discuss these works. MacDonalds's principal work in his later years also included domestic projects associated with some of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board's schemes, and with the Great Ouse flood protection scheme. The latter was first considered early in 1938 following serious flooding in the Fens. Several proposals were put forward, and he was asked to formulate a protection scheme in conjunction with the River Great Ouse Catchment Board. Detailed surveys were made to determine the practicability of the works involved, and a report dealing with the whole problem was presented to the Board. The report was printed in early March 1941, but its construction was delayed by the war and until further serious flooding emphasised its urgency. In the mid-1950s the work was started in earnest under the direction of MacDonalds's firm, but he would not see its completion. In addition to project work over his long civil engineering career, MacDonald gave his services to other spheres. He was elected an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1892, and became a full member in 1909. He presented two papers to the Institution dealing with various aspects of the work on the Aswan Dam, and was twice awarded the Telford Gold Medal. He became president of the Institution in 1932. He was created a K.C.M.G. in 1914, and was awarded the honour of C.B. in 1917. Political career MacDonald was elected as a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Inverness in 1922. He joined the National Liberal Party split in 1931, but resigned from the National Liberal group in the House of Commons in 1942 and according to some descriptions stood as an Independent Liberal MP at the 1945 general election. However Who was Who, The Times and Whitaker's Almanack all show Macdonald with the description Liberal National in 1945. At his last election, he became the House's oldest MP. He remained a member of his constituency association, which was aligned with the National Liberals. He sat until he retired as the oldest MP in 1950, at age 83. He died, aged 90, in 1957.

During 1929-1931 she was refitted and placed in reserve, but reactivated in 1932 to join the Mediterranean Fleet. In November Ceres was again reduced to the reserve. Wartime career The Home and Mediterranean Fleets On the outbreak of war in 1939 Ceres was recommissioned from the Reserve Fleet and placed on the Northern Patrol in the Denmark Strait between Iceland and Greenland. In January 1940, Ceres underwent a refit at the yards of Harland & Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland in preparation for her reassignment to the Mediterranean. On 15 February she was reassigned from HMNB Devonport to her new base at Malta, travelling via Gibraltar. During March she led contraband patrols in the Ionian Sea, and off the coast of Greece, checking ships transporting cargoes to the axis countries, as well as escorting allied convoys. The Eastern Fleet and Indian Ocean During April and May 1940, Ceres was assigned to the Eastern Fleet and based at Singapore. She was used to patrol off the Dutch East Indies coast in opposition to Japanese naval forces. In June she was assigned to operate in the Indian Ocean and based at Colombo and later Bombay, where she escorted tanker convoys from the Persian Gulf to the British colony at Aden. She then spent several months off the east coast of Africa, based at Mombassa, Kenya. Whilst on patrol off the coast of Somaliland she evacuated troops and civilians from British Somaliland to Aden, and she was later involved in convoy duties sailing around Cape Horn between Durban and Cape Town. Later that year she was sent to the Seychelles and other islands to search for German commerce raiders, who were preying on allied shipping in the area. From 16‚Äì19 August 1940 Ceres assisted in the evacuation of British and allied soldiers from Berbera in British Somaliland as Italian forces moved on the capital, transporting them to the relative safety of Aden. In this capacity, Ceres bombarded the advancing Italian column on 17 August, slowing their progress and giving British troops retreating after the Battle of Tug Argan time to evacuate.Wavell 1946, p. 2,724. In February 1941 Ceres, in company with the cruisers HMS Hawkins and HMS Capetown and the destroyer HMS Kandahar, blockaded Kisimayu in support of the offensive against Italian Somaliland, and the eventual reconquest of British Somaliland in March that year. She also rescued merchant navy prisoners of war from Brava and transported them to Mombassa. After this Ceres again returned to Colombo for repairs. On New Year's Day 1942, in company with the sloop HMS Bridgewater she escorted the 18 ships of Convoy WS-14 to South Africa from the U.K. with reinforcements for the Middle East. Ceres spent two months in the Persian Gulf, and then arrived at Simonstown for a three-month refit, where she was dry-docked. As with most of the ships of the 'C'-class, she was also fitted with six 20 mm single AA weapons to become an anti-aircraft cruiser. Coventry, Curacoa and Curlew had already undergone conversion before the war, but the outbreak delayed Ceres and Cardiff's conversions. She was then based at Aden and she also participated in the fall of Djibouti to the allied forces. She spent the rest of the year escorting convoys to Durban. She finally returned to home waters and her homeport of Devonport in October 1943. By now she had steamed over 235,000 miles in her career. Home waters In 1943 and 1944, HMS Ceres was used by the Royal Navy as \\"station ship\\" based at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. In late April 1944, HMS Ceres was refitted with radar and anti- aircraft weaponry and assigned to the US Task Force 127 to carry the Flag of the United States Navy Service Force during the invasion of Normandy. Ceres was assigned as one of the two Shuttle Control ships at Omaha Beach and, anchored inshore, directed the assembly and departure of unloaded, outbound vessels and convoys. Shuttle Control Command, embarked in anchored offshore, directed both Ceres for outbound vessels and the inbound Shuttle Control exercised from Capetown. Subsequently, following the destruction of the artificial harbour off Omaha Beach during the Great Storm that occurred approximately two weeks after 6 June 1944 and as a result of the German demolition of the Port of Cherbourg in late June, HMS Ceres and her sister ship, HMS Capetown, was assigned to the task of Shuttle Control, expediting the passage and unloading of vessels from the UK to Omaha and Utah Beaches. HMS Ceres remained \\"On Station\\" off Omaha Beach for the entire summer of 1944 from the early hours of 7 June until the end of August, 1944. When Cherbourg became available to shipping from the UK, HMS Ceres returned to Plymouth for overhaul and those US naval officers who had staffed the \\"Shuttle Control Operation\\" were reassigned.

It has a high concentration of hospitals and research institutions, particularly those related to biotechnology. The district is roughly bounded by Bloor Street on the north, Bay Street on the east, Dundas Street on the south, and Spadina Avenue on the west. Characteristics The area includes the main campus of the University of Toronto, as well as university affiliated leading health-care facilities such as the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto General Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the MaRS Discovery District. These buildings are concentrated along the section of University Avenue between Dundas and College Streets. An extension of the Discovery District is located at the southwest block of Kensington Market at the intersection of Dundas and Bathurst Streets, where the Krembil Research Institute of the Toronto Western Hospital is located. MaRS Discovery District is one of several research institutes located in the Discovery District. This area was subdivided from three main 'park lot' estates: Macaulay Estate (to the east, became a residential district known as 'the Ward' until demolished), Elmsley Estate (redivided with the Macaulay Estate which was concentrated to the south. Elmsley estate is closely tied with the history of both the University of Toronto and the commercial district on Yonge Street) and the Powell Estate (became the 'University Park' now the University of Toronto) A short stretch of Gerrard Street West from Bay Street to LaPlante Avenue was referred to as Gerrard Village, a Bohemian Greenwich Village like area from the late 19th century to the early 1970s. This area is referred to by Statistics Canada as census tract 5350035.00. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, 80% of the population surveyed reported an income of over $50 000 annually. This is almost 30% higher than the average provincial income. For the total 2011 population within the discovery district 395 people made between $30 000 ad $39 000 annually, 410 made between $40 000 and $49 000, and 2250 made over $50 000. The accuracy of these figures is questionable due to the National Household Survey being optional, and therefore wealthier people could possibly be over represented. But considering the location in the heart of downtown Toronto and the rapid expansion of condominium build ups, people would have to make more money to live here. Statistics Canada. National Household Survey 2011 History The original plans for the Town of York (later City of Toronto) divided the City along Lot Street (Queen Street) with a street grid creating small urban 'town lots' to the south and large rectangular 'park lots' (farms) to the north. The 'park lots' along Lot St (Queen) were given to many of York's (Toronto's) most prominent families who had professions and sometimes even a separate house in the Town and generally did not farm; therefore they often did not clear their lots of the natural forest. As each 'park lot' extended in a rectangle from Lot Street (Queen) to what would become Bloor,The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997. most of the estate houses were built on the north side of Lot Street opposite the Town. Four 'park lots' (numbers 9 to 12) comprised the area north of Queen just across from the heart of Toronto between Yonge Street and just west of College Avenue (now University Ave). Three of the families occupying these lots built large estate homes all fairly far north of Lot St (Queen): * Caer Howell (built for the Welsh Loyalist Chief Justice of Upper Canada; William Dummer Powell, later demolished) on College Avenue (now University Avenue). This lot became the 'University Park' (now University of Toronto).The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997. , Pg 26 * Elmsley Villa (built for another of Upper Canada's Chief Justices and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly; John Elmsley. Was Government House for the short time Toronto was the United Canada's capital) this family famously converted to Catholicism and founded St. Michael's College on their former 'park lot'.The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997. , Pg 24 * Teraulay Cottage (named after the owner Mr. & Mrs. Macauley n√©e Hayter who had served as surgeon with Simcoe's Queen's Rangers) later subdivided the estate with a square in the centre onto which fronted Terauley Cottage and Little Trinity Anglican Church (still standing) built on land donated by the family. This first Toronto residential neighbourhood north of Lot (Queen) was originally called 'Macauleytown' later 'the Ward'.The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997. , Pg 18 Osgoode Hall was completed in 1834, and presently houses the Law Society of Ontario. The situation of these lots just north of the town meant that this land was in high demand as the city outgrew its original boundaries south of Lot (Queen). As most Toronto streets started at Lot (Queen), the 'park lots' commanded impressive views into the town and many of the buildings that were built as the 'park lots' were subdivided by their owner, were impressive institutions such as Osgoode Hall (Upper Canada's Law Courts) still standing, built at the top of York Street by 1832 just two years before the Town of York became a City with the name Toronto. By the time Toronto became a city in 1834, the area south of Lot St (Queen) from the Garrison Creek to the Don River had all been subdivided and the four 'park lots' north of Lot St (Queen) were subdivided by their owners with the eastern lot (Macaulay's estate) becoming the first residential district north of Queen, the western lot (Powell's estate) becoming the 'University Park', gated parkland intended to become Toronto's UniversityToronto: City Life Old & New, Mike Filey, 1979. Pg 46 and the area between on the north side of Lot St (Queen) attracting various institutions and businesses. Development The area just north of Lot St (Queen) became something of an institutional area with buildings such as the House of Industry (still standing), the Armoury (behind Osgoode Hall, now demolished for the University Avenue Court Houses) and the Eaton's Company store to the south (creating 'the cavern' with the Hudson Bay building on the south of Queen St) and the University of Toronto in the 'University Park' to the north which was gated at Queen St & College Ave (University Ave) and was largely forested. The Ward, an economically depressed neighbourhood was demolished. By about 1900 there still remained a large residential district called 'The Ward' which became Toronto's first Chinatown but also attracted many attempts to have it demolished as it was economically depressed. At this time some of Toronto's oldest and most important institutions south of Queen were replaced with larger buildings north of Queen St such as Old City Hall (called 'New' City Hall at this time) at the top of Bay StreetToronto: City Life Old & New, Mike Filey, 1979. Pg 30 and the Ontario Parliament Building; Queen's Park on the University grounds at the top of College Avenue (renamed University Ave). Part of 'The Ward' had been demolished for the building of New City Hall (Now Old City Hall) and in the years after the first world war, several plans were made to more closely link the institutional area north of Queen with the older town to the south. Two plans in particular substantially changed this area although both ultimately collapsed with the Great Depression. University Avenue was extended south of Queen street although the street itself, formerly a large quiet street leading to Queen's Park and the 'University Park' was only slowly turned into the bustling Boulevard of towers and hospitals it is today, none of the Art Deco towers originally planned for the street were ever built. The second plan called for a new 'Federal Avenue' in the middle of the old town's grid (between Bay and York Streets) starting from the new Union Station north to a proposed Government complex on the north side of Queen.Historical Atlas of Toronto, Derek Hayes, 2008, , Pg 138 Many buildings in 'The Ward' were purchased by the government before the plan fell through. In the 1960s with the City of Toronto annexing the last independent municipalities, 'The Ward' was demolished and a new City Hall was built on the north side of Queen Street between what became Old City Hall and Osgoode Hall.

This was the last album in the band's metal era, as the band began writing more commercial hard rock on the following releases. On Silence is Madness, Bride also tried to achieve crossover success to the secular market, as they wrote slightly less Christian-based lyrics than before. Despite the changes, this album did not sell notably better than their previous releases. Recording history On this album, Bride left behind many of its speed and thrash metal elements found on its previous release, and adopted a more straightforward classic metal sound with blues influences. The albums puts more focus on hooks, as displayed in songs such as \\"Fool Me Once,\\" \\"Hot Down South Tonight,\\" and \\"Under the Influence.\\" In contrast to that, \\"Evil Dreams,\\" \\"All Hallow‚Äôs Eve,\\" and \\"No More Nightmares\\" represent a more haunting atmosphere. Bride also introduced a blues influenced hard rock song in \\"Rock Those Blues Away.\\" Lead vocalist Dale Thompson continues to bring his high pitched and at times operatic lead vocal style. The lead guitarist Steve Osborne left the band before recording this album, and Troy Thompson handles mostly the lead guitars on Silence is Madness. Troy displays guitar solos on four of the album's tracks, and the guitarist Rob Johnson delivers lead guitar on the five others, notably on \\"Evil Dreams\\" and \\"No More Nightmares.\\" Bassist Frankie Partipilo and drummer Stephan Rolland handled the rhythm section. The album's production was similar to their previous works, but this time they commissioned original artwork. The cover watercolor illustration was created by American Visionary artist Don Swartzentruber. Overview \\"Fool Me Once\\" is a straightforward heavy metal song that criticizes televangelists in a manner that they only want to make money and get richer by fooling people to do what the televangelists want and cause damage that way. The output of \\"Hot Down South Tonight\\" is based on blues and groove driven metal sound. The song is about a girl who became a star but the success made her lose her soul.The title song contains a whispered intro similar to that of \\"Heroes\\" from the precious album. \\"Until the End We Rock\\" is a more calmer, slower track. \\"Evil Dreams\\" is characterized by a haunting feel, combined with hard rock rhythm guitar and blues rock type lead guitar work. A short vocal part in the middle is reminiscent of hip hop. The lyrics of \\"Evil Dreams\\" talk about achieving power but then finding how it only deceives man, and only causes grieving. \\"Under the Influence\\" puts more emphasis on groovy metal output. The song is about self-control on various issues such as drinking alcohol. \\"All Hallow‚Äôs Eve\\" was written around the time the band was known as Matrix, and is one of the few tracks on the album to feature thrash metal influences reminiscent the songs on Live to Die. Containing a slightly doom metal type riff, an anthem- like riff, and a chorus of haunting combination of vocal harmonies, \\"All Hallow‚Äôs Eve\\" talks about the dangers within the possible true meaning of Halloween, that the costumes and trick-or-treating leads children to mystical deceits. \\"No More Nightmares\\" is a more up-tempo song, and \\"Rock Those Blues Away\\" is a blues rock driven hard rock track, reminiscent of the works of Glenn Kaiser Band and Darrell Mansfield. The song incorporates a harmonica with some organ playing. The lyrics have a cheerful attitude and talk about a person who has learned to stand on his own.

It was published to popular and critical acclaim, winning the inaugural First Blood Award for the best first crime novel of the year. Comedian Ed Byrne is known for being a fan of this story, as well as a friend of the author: he also chose it for his appearance on Radio 4's A Good Read. Plot Summary Jack Parlabane rents a flat from a friend in Edinburgh (which just happens to be opposite a police station), and investigating the unpleasant murder of a gambling medic in the flat below proves too much to resist, the victim mutilated and the crime scene grossly vandalized; the victim, Dr Jeremy Ponsonby, is tied up, missing both his nose and his index fingers, had his throat cut, and the crime scene is covered in urine and faeces and vomit, the latter being from the postman who found the body. Parlabane soon finds himself involved with a number of characters including Darren Mortlake, a hit-man from Essex, Dr Sarah Slaughter, the dead doctor's ex-wife, lesbian with attitude DC Jenny Dalziel, and crooked hospital trust administrator Stephen Lime. The book takes its name from a song from Warren Zevon's 1991 album Mr. Bad Example. It was followed by the best seller Country of the Blind in 1997 which again involved Jack Parlabane. Synopsis Journalist Jack Parlabane gets accidentally locked out and, entering a neighbour's flat, stumbles into a bizarre crime scene, the victim a horribly mutilated Dr Jeremy Ponsonby. With Parlabane found suspicious and taken in for questioning, Ponsonby's ex-wife, Dr Sarah Slaughter, later enters the unattended crime scene in an attempt to accept his death. Finding a plastic ampoule dropped at the scene, Sarah collects it as Parlabane appears, released from custody, and he invites her into his flat to talk. Explaining he's a crime journalist who very recently fled Los Angeles, Jack tells Sarah that he believes her ex-husband's murder was for personal or political reasons, and not a \\"break-in gone wrong\\" as the police believe. Previously, hitman Darren Mortlake snuck into Posonby's flat on behalf of Midlothian NHS trust administrator Stephen Lime, intending to inject Ponsonby with potassium chloride and make his death look like a heart attack. Accidentally waking Ponsonby, a struggle ensues where Ponsonby bites off Darren's index finger and several pieces of furniture are smashed. Having knocked his target out, Darren ties him and cuts his throat, angrily mutilating his body as he dies. Before he leaves, Darren thoroughly contaminates the crime scene in an attempt to overwhelm and confuse the police. Hiding in a Bed and Breakfast hotel owned by one Mrs Kinross, Darren inadvertently attracts her attention when he impulsively kills her dog, despite tactfully disposing of the body. Meeting with DC Jenny Dalziel, Jack explains about the ampoule, and Jenny agrees to work with him quid pro quo provided he doesn't incriminate himself. Finding Sarah during her on-call shift, Jack finds parts of the hospital, especially the on-call room, to be in severe disrepair. Jack soon learns that as Sarah's marriage deteriorated, Posonby amassed large gambling debts; Ponsonby's father cleared his debt provided he repay him directly from his wages, meaning any of the NHS Trust's senior staff could know of Ponsonby's financial issues and manipulate him. Working with Dalziel to examine the crime scene, the group soon finds ¬£2000 hidden in Ponsonby's flat, meaning Posonby was a criminal who was silenced. Jack has his old US editor, Mike Gorman, arrange a visit to the county hospital. Excited about the publicity, Lime's staff welcomes Jack to the hospital, allowing him to case the security and strike a deal with the hospital's disgruntled IT administrator, Matt Dempsy. Returning at night, Jack accesses the system with a login provided by Dempsey, allowing him to decrypt Lime's personal files; Jack not only figures out Lime is behind Ponsonby's murder, but that he plans to demolish the elderly care centre and sell the land for hotel development, clearing the Trust's debt and making him a fortune in bribes. Mrs Kinross, aware Darren has murdered her dog and discovering he's a fugitive, drugs his food and ties him to his bed, breaking his nose in anger and leaving to calling the police. Forced to act quickly, Darren pulls the knife from his pillow with his mouth, severely slicing his cheeks but cutting his bonds. Still heavily drugged, Darren escapes but collapses near a train track, waking to find his hand being severed by a passing train. Phoning Anna, one of his contacts, Jack has her trace the deal back to Lime and the Midlothian Trust through several proxy companies and businessmen, proving Lime's involvement beyond doubt. Sarah, following a hunch, looks at the patient archives and finds a horrifying pattern: numerous dementia patients, so ill they required permanent hospice care, were all found dead of a presumed cardiac arrest the day after Jeremy Ponsonby was the on-call registrar; Ponsonby had murdered over thirty long-term patients for Lime, freeing up bed space in the elderly care centre and making it easier to justify a closure and demolition, making her late husband a prolific serial killer. Lime, pressed into acting by his business associates, checks his files and plans and realizes they're not encrypted, causing him to panic. Also seeing that Dr Slaughter has accessed the patient archives most recently, Lime flees the office. Having failed to apprehend Darren and informed by Jack, Dalziel and the inspectors race to Lime's home, only to find him missing and an empty case of shotgun shells. Answering the door at his flat, Jack and Sarah are cornered by Lime, who holds them at gunpoint while a grievously mutilated Darren appears. Promising to get him medical attention and pay him further, Lime tells Darren to kill Jack and Sarah so he can keep his hands clean; Jack points out that Lime will just shoot Darren once he does and make it look like a murder suicide, citing Ponsonby as another example of him killing any loose ends. Darren jumps onto Lime, causing Lime to shoot off Darren's remaining hand before Jack disarms him. Forcing the shotgun in Lime's mouth, Jack threatens to kill Lime for revenge against all the slimey businessmen who have tried to frame and kill him for catching them; Lime soils himself and begins crying, prompting Jack to remove the gun from his mouth, taunting that Lime deserves the life imprisonment and resulting sexual assault he'll suffer as police sirens approach. With Lime and Darren arrested and the case closed, Jack and Sarah agree to spend some time together, and kiss. Television adaptation In 2003 the novel was adapted into a television film by Clerkenwell Films for the ITV network. It was dramatised by Stuart Hepburn and directed by Sam Miller. Irish actor James Nesbitt played Parlabane, and spoke with his own accent instead of Parlabane's Glaswegian one. The producers had originally wanted Scottish actor Douglas Henshall to play Parlabane, but they were overruled by ITV's commissionersStaff (16 February 2004). \\"Star is set to be Quite Ugly One Morning in TV drama\\". Edinburgh Evening News (Scotsman Publications). (Henshall had previously played Parlabane in a radio adaptation of the short story \\"Bampot Central\\"). Eddie Marsan, Annette Crosbie, Daniela Nardini and Mark Benton also starred. The drama was broadcast by ITV on 5 September 2004. There were substantial changes to the plot, with Lime being a more sympathetic character and much of his backstory and political leanings removed. Morven Christie played Jenny Dunlop (Jenny Dalziel in the book) and is Parlabane's love interest rather than Sarah Slaughter.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom Vauxhall introduced a new top-of-the-range saloon and estate that was directed at buyers of the Ford Granada and Rover SD1. The Carlton was a rear-wheel drive executive car that replaces the VX1800/VX2000 and offered a more modern and attractive package with more refinements. It was built in Germany alongside the identical Opel Rekord. Chrysler's financially troubled European division bolstered its chances of survival with the launch of a five-door front-wheel drive hatchback, the Horizon, which was the first car of its kind to be built in Britain, similar in concept to the Volkswagen Golf launched in West Germany four years earlier. It gave buyers a modern alternative to the ageing rear-wheel drive Avenger saloons and estates, which continued in production despite falling directly into the category of cars that the Horizon might be expected to replace. This meant that the carmaker was in the unusual position of offering rear-wheel drive saloons and estates as well as a front- wheel drive hatchback at the same time. France While the British Ryton plant welcomed the Talbot Horizon, Chrysler's French plant at Poissy produced the Simca Horizon. Aside the badge, the French version was identical to the British version. For French buyers, it replaced the ageing Simca 1100 - although that smaller and more obsolete car continued in production. The Chrysler/Simca Horizon was European Car of the Year for 1979. Renault expandeded its range with the launch of the R18 saloon and estates. It replaced the smaller R12 saloon as well as some versions of the ageing R16 hatchback, which was partially replaced by the R20/R30 in 1975. The R18 shared much of its mechanical design with the smaller R14 hatchback. The R16 would be axed the following year, while the R12 would continue until 1980. It offered front-wheel drive in a market where rear-wheel drive cars like the Ford Cortina/Taunus and Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Ascona still led the way in terms of sales. Peugeot launched the first of its \\"05\\" generation of cars. The 305 was a stylish range of medium-sized saloons and estates which replaced the 304, although that car remained in production for another two years. 1978 was the 2CV's 30th year of production but the makers launched a more modern and practical small car to give buyers more choice. The Visa was visually in keeping with Citroen's individuality, but underneath it was mostly made up of Peugeot components. Most importantly, it gave buyers the advantage of four doors and a hatchback within a compact package - something that most other carmakers did not have, as most cars in this sector at the time were available only as three-door hatchbacks. Germany Six years after its launch, the Audi 80 underwent its first facelift. The front end saw the most changes, but otherwise it was recognisable as the solid four-door saloon which had bolstered Audi's fortunes in past years. Volkswagen finished European production of the Beetle although production continued in Mexico and Brazil. European buyers were still able to buy Beetles, but new models such as the Polo and Golf became the brand's market leaders. Opel launched a new version of its Rekord range-topper, which was built in West Germany and built alongside Britain-bound models that were sold as the Vauxhall Carlton. Italy The most controversially styled car of 1978 was possibly the Fiat Ritmo hatchback (Strada in the UK). It ran along the 128 saloon, using much of that model's front-wheel drive running gear. The car would soon be famous for a series of adverts featuring robots on its production line with the slogan \\"Handbuilt By Robots\\". Poland Nine years after launching the Fiat 125-based 125p (sold in Britain since 1975 as the Polski Fiat), FSO expanded its range with the launch of the Polonez, which made use of the same engines and running gear as the original Polski Fiat. Japan Nissan built on the success of its Datsun badged vehicles in Europe with the launch of updated versions of the entry-level Cherry and larger Sunny. Soviet union Lada launched the Niva four-wheel drive model becoming a two-model manufacturer a decade after the launch of its Fiat based saloon and estates. The Niva, however, is Lada's own design and was developed partly for military use but became popular with buyers looking for a cheap model with four-wheel-drive ability.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the Diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Congleton. Its benefice is combined with those of St Stephen, Congleton, St John the Evangelist, Buglawton, and Holy Trinity, Mossley. Alec Clifton-Taylor includes it in his list of 'best' English parish churches. The Church Buildings Council included St Peter\`s in its group of 300 Major Parish Churches following research produced in 2016. [Pursell 2016] History The original church was built on the site in the early 15th century as a chapel of ease to St Mary, Astbury. It was timber framed and by 1740 its structure had become decayed. A new church was built in the Neoclassical style and completed by 1742. The tower was raised in 1786. The lower part of the 14th century tower was retained. The architect was William Baker of Audlem. In 1839‚Äì40 the church was extended at the west end by one bay on each side of the tower, and a porch was added, also at the west end, by Joshua Radford. Architecture Exterior The church is built in red brick with stone dressings, the roof is of stone slate and the west tower is of stone. Its plan consists of a five- bay nave continuous with a single-bay chancel, and north and south aisles. The tower is at the west end. The tower has a clock and on its summit is a parapet and pinnacles. Two coats of arms are carved on the western wall. The door is at the west end and is surrounded by a porch with Doric columns. Interior Internally there are galleries on the north, south and west sides, and Georgian box pews. The pulpit dates from the 17th century and, at the time Richards was writing, it was the only pulpit in Cheshire to be placed in front of the sanctuary in the middle of the nave. Between the nave and the aisles are square piers supporting Tuscan columns. The marble font dates from 1742 and a brass candelabrum from 1748. The reredos is dated 1743 and its panels contain the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments and the Apostles' Creed. The east window is Palladian in style and is flanked by mural paintings of Saint Peter and Saint Paul by Edward Penny of Knutsford. The royal coat of arms of William III dated 1702 are at the east end of the north gallery. The only stained glass is in the east window. Part of this dates from about 1740, and depicts the Holy Spirit as a dove. Below this is glass dating from about 1922. The finest memorial is a wall tablet in memory of Sir Thomas Reade who died in 1849. This is by Thomas and Edward Gaffin and shows a native kneeling by a palm tree. There are more wall tablets dating from the 19th century, and monuments from the 18th and 19th centuries. The organ was built in 1824 by Renn and Boston and was rebuilt in 1911 by Steele and Keay. There is a ring of eight bells. The oldest four were made by Rudhall of Gloucester, three in 1720 and one in 1757. The other four were cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, one by Thomas Mears and Son in 1806, and the others by Mears and Stainbank in 1867. External features The gates, gate piers and railings of the churchyard are listed at Grade II. The gate piers are of stone with panelled sides and cornice caps. The gates and railings are in wrought iron. Over the gate is a wrought iron overthrow and a lantern. The churchyard contains the war graves of eleven British service personnel, seven of World War I, and four of World War II.

This album was the band's first release on the Star Song label, and started the band's hard rock era, leaving straightforward metal behind and focusing on a more commercial sound. The band tasted success with the song \\"Everybody Knows My Name\\" which won them a GMA Dove Award,\\"Dove Award Recipients for HARD MUSIC RECORDED SONG OF THE YEAR \\". Published by the Gospel Music Association. Retrieved 2007-02-05. and \\"Sweet Louise\\" was a Christian radio hit. The following album, Snakes in the Playground, would become a commercial success. Recording history The origin of Kinetic Faith traces back to the time between the release of the band's albums Live to Die and Silence is Madness when vocalist Dale Thompson decided to pursue a secular career because he was growing tired with the Christian music industry. Dale became involved in a California-based band called Thunder Ball with the experienced Los Angeles scene bass player Rik Fox and performed concerts for two weeks as well as spent some time in the studio. while working with Rik Fox, Thompson was introduced to several bands whose roots date back to Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple. After finishing the studio work with Thunder Ball, Dale decided to return to Kentucky and continue working a new project with Bride. The result of his experience in California impacted that Thompson would turn Bride's musical direction to more straightforward hard rock, influenced by Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple. Dale Thompson again began working with his brother Troy, bassist Frankie Partipilo and drummer Stephan Rolland, and in 1989 recorded Silence is Madness. After the record deal with Pure Metal Records ended, Partipilo and Rolland departed Bride. Dale and Troy Thompson were joined by the bassist Rick Foley and drummer Jerry McBroom. They began working on new material, and recorded 3 demo tapes which included songs such as \\"Young Love\\" and \\"Kiss The Train.\\" These songs introduced a more blues based hard rock output. Around this time the band was informed by Dez Dickerson, an executive at Star Song records, that Star Song had bought rights for the Refuge Music Group's back catalog, including Bride‚Äôs first three albums. The label and wanted to release a \\"Best Of Bride\\" compilation and wanted Bride to record two new songs for it as well. Two songs were selected: \\"Everybody Knows My Name\\" and \\"Same Ol‚Äô Sinner.\\" End of the Age: The Best of Bride was released in 1990 and both songs were big hits: \\"Everybody Knows My Name\\" stayed at the #1 position on Christian metal radio for twelve weeks and \\"Same Ol‚Äô Sinner\\" held the same spot for ten weeks. Although the label was not planning to take Bride into its roster at first, after negotiating with Dale Thompson both Dez and Mike Kyle of Star Song signed a multi-album deal for the band. Kinetic Faith was recorded in a studio in Nashville called the Salt Mine. Although the band ran into disagreements with the producer Steve Griffin, the album put Bride in the mainstream of Christian music. Overview Kinetic Faith was a drastic departure from the music on Bride's first three albums, abandoning the previous classic metal, speed metal and thrash metal roots. Kinetic Faith has a hard rock sound with elements from traditional rock and roll and blues, reflecting influences of groups such as Aerosmith, Guns N‚Äô Roses, Dangerous Toys, M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Kix. Dale Thompson abandoned most of his high pitched wails, taking a more controlled and even approach with raspy and blues flavored parts. Troy Thompson incorporates bluesy licks, and Rob Johnson plays some lead and rhythm guitar parts as a guest musician. The previous double bass drum efforts were replaced with a more groove oriented drumming by Jerry McBroom. \\"Everybody Knows My Name,\\" \\"Hired Gun, \\"Mountain,\\" and \\"Ever Fall in Love\\" all feature acoustic laced hard rock sound, while \\"Troubled Times\\" and \\"Ski Mask\\" move in a more guitar driven direction. \\"Ever Fall in Love‚Äù and \\"Young Love,\\" deliver up-tempo hooks and stand create tension to album closer \\"Sweet Louise,\\" an acoustic based rock and roll ballad. Lyrically, the album deals with social issues from Christian perspective. The album opener ‚ÄúTroubled Times‚Äù deals with bigotry and racism, ‚ÄúEverybody Knows My Name‚Äù tells the story of a man who gained fame and riches through music but found that in the end all he had in life was worthless without God; \\"Crimes Against Humanity\\" tells that all men are guilty of crimes against humanity by neglecting the homeless and poor; ‚ÄúSki Mask‚Äù talks about a man who was a criminal but in the end found God; The lyrics to ‚ÄúKiss The Train‚Äù includes an anti-suicide message. \\"Hired Gun‚Äù is about an assassin, the band explains a certain line inte lyrics on the liner notes: > The assassin always poses this question to his victims ‚Äì ‚ÄúHope you and Jesus > have it all worked out.‚Äù This is the same question that God will ask you > when you stand before Him to g ive an account of your life.

Cuddly Dudley is a lifesize (at 28.5 inch tall) shiny plush stuffed animal nostalgic cocker spaniel doll that was used as a subscription sales promotional item by the Chicago Tribune in the mid-1960s.Bergstron, Micheal. (December 25, 1996) Sarasota Herald-Tribune \\"Christmas magic reappears for cynic.\\" Section: Local/State; Page 4B. In addition, the animal took on a life of its own as a recurring puppet character on Chicago children's TV for many years. Promotional gimmick Cuddly Dudley was an idea Jerry Glasspiegel came up within the middle of the night when he was thinking of a good promotion idea for his customer, The Chicago Tribune. Francis A. Schumacher, the then-home circulation supervisor for the Chicago Tribune, helped start the Cuddly Dudley promotion program. As part of the program, home subscribers received a stuffed dog for subscribing.Chicago Tribune (May 8, 1992) Francis A. Schumacher. Section: Chicagoland; page 8.Mullery, Virginia. (December 20, 1992) Chicago Tribune Christmases past can still warn the soul. Section: Womannews; Page 6. The idea was very similar to Disney or McDonald's, in that the hope was that the kids would pester the parents for the animal, effectively shilling for the paper. As part of the scheme a 1967 Sunday paper, the newspaper's largest issue of the week, included a cut and fold insert encouraging kids to \\"save\\" Dudley from the \\"runaway Christmas train.\\"Chicago Kid Shows Vintage dolls with the original box, which converts into Dudley's cardboard car, get up to $200 at auction.(Gallery of photos show both Dudley and the car) On television Roy Brown, a fixture on WGN's kid vid for decades, subsequently retrofitted the plush animal as a working puppet. He performed as the voice and puppeteer behind Cuddly for many years on \\"Ray Rayner and Friends\\", a classic morning show on WGN, which was also owned by the Chicago Tribune. The segment appeared weekly on Fridays near the end of the show, for the last 10‚Äì15 minutes. Ray would begin singing \\"The Cuddly Dudley Song\\" (to the music of \\"The Whistler and His Dog\\" by Arthur Pryor) and walk over to Cuddly's doghouse. Dudley would proceed to read jokes and display artwork submitted by local Chicago children. The big draw was getting one's name mentioned on air, as Dudley would always namedrop each submitter's name before the joke/artwork was read/ shown. Knock- knock jokes were a recurring theme. Ray would give a wonderful forced laugh after each joke. There were always adult ad-libs between Brown and Rayner, and Roy Brown often would get Ray to crack up if he was feeling particularly silly that morning. Cuddly Dudley also appeared on the Bozo the Clown show.Peters, Jeff. (April 4, 2001) Chicago Tribune Missing Bozo. Section: Commentary; page 14. The puppet and his doghouse are part of the collection of the Museum of Broadcast Communications. Theme song As Rayner began the segment he would sing the following song. Music by Arthur Pryor.

IWPR has informed policy by putting relevant, high quality facts in the hands of thousands of local leaders and advocates, increasing their ability to shape and implement legislation that benefits women and their families. IWPR has published hundreds of reports, fact sheets, and research- in-briefs that place women as the central point of analysis. The research serves as a reliable resource to policymakers, providing background and context for present and future policy agendas impacting women in the United States and around the world. IWPR‚Äôs research addresses issues of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In addition, IWPR research focuses specifically on policies that help or hurt women in their efforts to achieve social, economic, and political equality.http://www.iwpr.org/about/history Program Areas Employment, Economic Change & Education IWPR examines the quality of jobs across a diverse range of workers and job types as well as produces research that explores access to employment benefits. On average, women earn less than men in virtually every single occupation for which there is sufficient data for both men and women to calculate an earnings ratio. IWPR tracks the gender wage gap over time. Given the existing gender wage gap, educational attainment is especially crucial for women, as women need more education to reach the same average income levels as men. Democracy and Society IWPR seeks to identify successful strategies to encourage women‚Äôs participation in civic and political life by analyzing data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels. Poverty, Welfare and Income Security Around the world, research shows that women tend to be in poverty at greater rates than men. IWPR has served as a resource on women‚Äôs poverty issues by producing research on income security and suggesting improvements to planning and policies that take into consideration the welfare of women. Work and Family For most Americans, work and family go hand in hand. Early care and education programs are crucial to a thriving economy, not only because they allow parents to work, but because the child care sector is large and purchases numerous goods and services. IWPR aims to improve access to child care, measure workplace flexibility and determine whether the defining characteristics of a good job are being implemented in American society. Health and Safety Women have specific concerns when it comes to health. More often than not, women make the majority of health care-related decisions regarding health issues for their families, are the primary caregivers, and spend more than their male counterparts on health (KFF 2009; Agency for 2004). IWPR‚Äôs research on women‚Äôs health and safety informs policy decisions by identifying gender and racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes and access to health care services in addition to highlighting opportunities for improvement. IWPR Projects and Initiatives Status of Women in the States Reports IWPR has analyzed data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels, including demographics, economic security, educational attainment, reproductive rights, political participation, civic engagement, and access to health care and work support in order to publish a collection of comprehensive reports. Each report offers policy recommendations shaped by the research findings for that state, city or area. Women and Social Security Women are more likely to rely on Social Security because they have fewer alternative sources of income, often outlive their husbands, and are more likely to be left to rear children when their husbands die or become disabled. Specifically, adult women are 57 percent of all social security beneficiaries aged 65 and older. IWPR produces and disseminates materials to keep women involved on the ongoing Social Security debate and to ensure that women‚Äôs concerns are addressed when or if any changes to the system take place. Student Parent Success Initiative The Student Parent Success Initiative focuses on supporting students with dependent children who are pursuing college education. Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the project gives IWPR the opportunity to initiate new research and foster communication and collaboration among advocates, policymakers, and practitioners invested in the success of student parents in postsecondary education.

Prior to the launch of Myspace, Greenspan grew eUniverse into one of the largest Entertainment networks on the internet. According to Comscore Netscore, the eUniverse Network was the ninth largest internet property for the month of October 2001.http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/1707590/top-online-properties- october-2001 Greenspan resigned from eUniverse in late October 2003 as CEO and as a Director in December 2003, stating that he felt that other \\"directors have breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders.\\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1088244/000119312503096563/dex991.htm The company was sold to News Corp in 2005, which Greenspan opposed, and has been fighting News Corp both legally and publicly since. Angel Investing Websites launched by Greenspan and eUniverse included: Flowgo.com launched in late 2000 focused on viral entertainment including flash cartoons and greeting cards. By June 2001, Flowgo.com had become the #1 entertainment website on the internet with 12,980,000 unique monthly visitors according to Nielsen NetRatings. Madblast.com launched in 2001 became a leader in online flash games. CupidJunction.com launched in 2001 was eUniverse's dating website. Justsaywow.com launched in 2000 was a leader in flash entertainment and boasted a daily email newsletter with over 50 million subscribers. Skilljam.com a skilled online gaming property was launched by eUniverse in 2002. In March 2003, Skilljam announced it had struck an exclusive multi-year partnership to run skilled pay-per-play gaming for Microsoft‚Äôs MSN property. Forbes described the partnership in a March 18, 2003 article titled ‚ÄúWin Bill Gates‚Äô Money‚Äù.https://www.forbes.com/2003/03/18/cx_aw_0318games.html Greenspan has invested in several other businesses as an angel investor, e.g. Gametize.com a fast growing Singapore online gaming company, Shoppinglifestyle.com a fast growing portal focused on a young female demographic, Broadwebasia (an Asian internet company, out of business), Borba (a health product-line, not available any more), and LiveUniverse (a social network focused internet company, out of business). LiveVideo, Inc. and its livevideo.com (now defunct) social network launched in 2008 were one of the first live streaming platforms. Greenspan invested in the first outside round of BigFishGames, Inc. in 2006 and in 2008 when BigFishGames raised $83 million from venture capital funds, Greenspan sold his stake for over a 1000% profit.http://www.prweb.com/releases/big_fish/fish_games/prweb1324694.htm Greenspan was also an early investor in mobile entertainment startup New Motion, Inc. in 2006 and owned approximately 6% of the company when it went public in 2008, selling his stake for an over 2000% profit.http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/spos/filing.ashx?filingid=5043690 Greenspan invested in China based Hupo.TV, an online video site, in 2006, which grew to over 30 million unique monthly users by December 2007.

History Brad Greenspan attended UCLA, where he launched his first company, Palisades Capital, from his dormitory room. MySpace The MySpace service was founded in August 2003 as a new initiative and 100% owned division of publicly traded internet company eUniverse (which later in mid-2004 changed its name to Intermix). eUniverse created and marketed the Myspace website, providing the division with a complete infrastructure of finance, human resources, technical expertise, bandwidth, and server capacity right out of the gate so the MySpace team wasn‚Äôt distracted with typical start-up issues. The project was overseen by Brad Greenspan (eUniverse's Founder, Chairman, CEO), with Chris DeWolfe (MySpace's former CEO), Josh Berman, Tom Anderson (MySpace's former president), and a team of programmers and resources provided by eUniverse. Brad Greenspan / The MySpace Report  In October 2006, Brad Greenspan launched a website, called freemyspace.com, and published reports that called for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance to investigate News Corp's acquisition of MySpace as \\"one of the largest merger and acquisition scandals in U.S. history.\\" The report's main allegation is that News Corp. should have valued MySpace at US$20 billion rather than US$327 million, and had, in effect, defrauded Intermix shareholders through an unfair deal process. The report received a mixed response from financial commentators in the press. A lawsuit led by Greenspan challenging the acquisition was dismissed by a judge. Greenspan's claims were validated when in June 2010 Judge George H. King ruled in favor of shareholders in a summary judgment decision. According to Gretchen Morgenson of The New York Times, \\"Viewed as a whole, Judge King wrote, the evidence indicates that ‚Äúthere are at least triable issues of fact‚Äù about whether Mr. Rosenblatt acted in good faith or tilted the auction in favor of the News Corporation ‚Äúfor a purpose other than maximizing shareholder value.‚Äù A trial might also determine if the rest of the Intermix board improperly put Mr. Rosenblatt in charge of the auction process and then turned a blind eye to his actions, the judge concluded.\\" Further, the Judge refused to dismiss the damage report finding \\"shareholders suffered economic damages in the News Corporation bid of $506 million to $667 million\\" References Category:American Internet celebrities Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American computer businesspeople Category:Myspace Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni ","title":"Brad Greenspan"},{"id":"13097926","text":"Michal Bro≈° (born 25 January 1976 in Olomouc, Czech Republic) is a Czech professional ice hockey forward who currently plays for HC Sparta Prague in the Czech Extraliga.

The amplifier was initially created as a signature model for Eddie Van Halen. After Van Halen and Peavey parted ways in 2004, the name was changed to Peavey 6505. The 5150 name was used again by Van Halen in partnership with Fender under the EVH brand. Peavey's amplifier was renamed to 6505 in celebration of Peavey's 40th anniversary (1965‚Äì2005). Design of the amplifier begun in 1990 and it became a flagship project for Peavey and for then lead engineer James Brown (who has since founded Amptweaker ), lasting for about 13 years, comprising the 5150 and 5150 II, until 2004. While the product was designed around a centered printed circuit board (PCB), an aspect sometimes considered \\"impure\\" among audiophiles, its cascading five preamps (actually four preamplifiers and one phase inverter) and four gain stages were implemented in a very simple manner. This design and implementation allowed the individual components to carry themselves (such as by placing the transformer so as to ensure acoustical integrity by minimizing transconductance), in addition to commonizing the system's ground by way of a multilayer PCB, thereby avoiding a large source of unwanted nuances in most poorly grounded musical applications. Initially, the Peavey 5150 I shipped with four Sylvania 6L6 Power Tube, this was later changed to Ruby Tube 6L6 Power Tubes, when Peavey's Sylvania supply was exhausted (per James Brown, \\"Tone-Talk\\", Ep. 17)Ep. 17 - James Brown of Amptweaker, Peavey Van Halen 5150, Satriani JSX, Synyster Gates - YouTube, and five 12AX7 Tubes in the preamplifier staging (with one as a phase inverter). A defining attribute largely responsible for the 5150 sound is the fixed bias. Commonly described as an analog to a car engine and its respective idle, the 5150 bias was set to a lower value (lower engine \\"idle\\") which resulted in the Power Tubes running at a lower energy commonly known as \\"cold-biased.\\" This configuration supposedly resulted in a more controllable gain setting (i.e. having a more forgiving sonic range than similarly \\"hot-biased\\" configurations. While able to stand among modern technology as a relatively \\"simple\\" design, especially in comparison to boutique \\"hand-wired\\" variants, the reliability and era its inception welcomed helped verify its cultural significance in Hard Rock, later Metal, as a unique product with a unique tone. Both the 5150 and the 6505 are well known for its high gain overdrive channel, and has seen widespread use by rock, hardcore and metal guitarists. An early breakthrough was its use by Colin Richardson and Andy Sneap, two \\"seminal\\" British producers of heavy metal; especially Machine Head's Burn My Eyes (1994) helped the 5150 gain a reputation for its sound, which \\"defined a generation of guitar tone\\". Other notable artists and producers to use the 5150/6505 include Jason Suecof, Matt Tuck and Dino Cazares. Versions Although some players believe that the 5150 (particularly the \\"block letter 5150\\") to be better-sounding than the 6505, the only difference is that the original 5150s shipped with a different brand of power tubes. Since vacuum tubes are consumable items, it is likely that the original power tubes fitted at the point of manufacture, have been since been replaced. It has also been rumored that the bias potentiometer on the 6505 does not sweep wide enough to provide optimal plate amperage to provide the full 35 milliamp 6L6GC plate current, thereby increasing crossover distortion. 5150 / 6505 The 6505 is the base model of the series, and is identical to the 5150, with exception of the phase inverter and its name. It has five 12AX7 tubes in the preamplifier. The power amplifier uses four 6L6GC tubes in the power section in class AB. It has 120 watts RMS output power, into 16, 8 or 4 Ohms. The effects loop can be bypassed with a footswitch. It features separate input for both high and low gain. The amplifier has two channels, rhythm and lead. Each channel provides the user with separate pre-/postgain control, and the rhythm has an extra crunch and bright switch. The channels share a 3-Band EQ and presence and resonance controls. Switching channels can be done both via the front panel of the amp, or with the remote footswitch. It is also available in a 60 watt 2√ó12 combo. The 2√ó12 combo features 60 watts of RMS output power into 16 or 8ohms. It also features five 12AX7 preamps tubes and two 6L6GC power amp tubes. 5150II / 6505 Plus The 6505+ is a second version of the 6505 and is identical to the 5150II. It features an extra 12AX7 tube in the preampstage, to prevent breakup in the clean channel. It features separate 3-band EQ, presence and resonance controls for the 2 channels. It also features only one input, unlike the 6505, which had two. There are bias testpoints on the back, making changes to the tubes easier. It is available in a 60 watt 1x12 combo (Called 6505+112), of which the internal circuitry is identical to that of the head, with exception of using 2 instead of 4 6L6GC powertubes an additional 3-spring reverb. It is made in China to cut costs. 6534+ Plus This version is identical to the 6505+, but uses EL34 tubes instead of 6L6GC tubes in the power section. It was created as a response to the growing demand of high-gain EL34 amplifiers, previously found almost solely in Marshall and ENGL amplifiers, both European brands References Category:Instrument amplifiers Category:Peavey amplifiers ","title":"Peavey 5150"},{"id":"13097936","text":"Narreme is the basic unit of narrative structure. According to Helmut Bonheim (2000), the concept of narreme was developed three decades earlier by Eugene Dorfman and expanded by Henri Wittmann, The narreme is to narratology what the sememe is to semantics, the morpheme is to morphology and the phoneme to phonology. The narreme, however, has yet to be persuasively defined in practice. In interpretative narratology constrained in a framework of Principles and parameters, narration is the projection of a narreme N0, the abstract head of a narrative macrostructure where Nn dominates immediately Nn-1 (Wittmann 1995).In this author's views, narremes are the constituents of narrative algorithms, a concept that has found applications in game theory and game semantics (Shivel 2009) See also * Mytheme * Narratology * Narrative * Narrative structure Notes Bibliography *Bonheim, Helmut. 2000. \\"Shakespeare's narremes.\\" In: Shakespeare Survey 53: Shakespeare and narrative.

Espeletia grandiflora The plants live at high altitude in p√°ramo ecosystems. The trunk is thick, with succulent hairy leaves disposed in a dense spiral pattern. Marcescent leaves help protect the plants from cold. The flowers are usually yellow, similar to daisies. The frailej√≥n plant is endangered due to destruction of the p√°ramo for agricultural purposes, especially potato crops. This activity continues, despite the Colombian government declaring it illegal. Since about 2010 the plants have also come under attack by beetle larvae, a moth and a fungus, some new to science but suspected to be related to climate change which allows lower- altitude species to flourish. The Espeletia is well known for contributing to the world in water sustainability by capturing water vapor from passing clouds in its spongy trunk and releasing it through the roots into the soil, thus helping to create vast high-altitude subterranean water deposits and lakes that will eventually form rivers.

Kings of Oblivion is a 1973 album by the UK underground group Pink Fairies. Paul Rudolph had quit the group on the release of What a Bunch of Sweeties, thus briefly deactivating the band. Duncan Sanderson and Russell Hunter formed a new band with Steve Peregrin Took and guitarist Mick Wayne, before splitting from Took and reactivating the Pink Fairies with Wayne as singer/guitarist. This new three piece recorded one single, \\"Well, Well, Well\\"/\\"Hold On\\", but Sanderson and Hunter were unhappy with the musical direction Wayne was taking the band.

She served as a member of the Florida Senate for ten years, representing parts of Central Florida from 2002 to 2012 as a Republican. Previously, she served three terms in the Florida House of Representatives, representing a Lakeland- based district from 1996 until her election to the Senate. In January 2017, she left the Republican Party and became an independent.  Early life  Dockery was born Paula Louise Bono in Queens, New York, on June 6, 1961. Her family moved to Florida in 1968, and she graduated from Coral Springs High School in 1979. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from the University of Florida in 1983. While at UF, she was a member of Student Senate, served on the O'Connell Center Board of Managers, Chaired the Affairs & Ethics Committee, and was a graduate teaching assistant. In 1985 she married Mark Fisher, an aide to United States Senator Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, and in 1986 the couple moved to Lakeland, Florida. She finished her Master of Arts degree in Mass Communications during 1987, divorced her first husband in 1988, and decided to become active in Republican politics. She was introduced to and married C.C. (Doc) Dockery, a Lakeland businessman and GOP fundraiser, in November 1989. The family business was citrus and cattle.  State legislature  Dockery was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1996, and served three terms. She served as Majority Whip from 1998 through 2000, and was the primary sponsor of the popular Florida Forever Act. In 2002, she ran for the Florida Senate, and was elected to a district encompassing northern Polk County and parts of surrounding Osceola, Lake, Sumter, and Hernando Counties. She served as Majority Whip from 2002 until 2004. Dockery chaired the Environmental Protection Committee and the Criminal Justice Committee. She was term limited in 2012 and could not run for re-election.  2010 gubernatorial campaign  On June 1, 2009, there was a draft campaign to see Senator Dockery run for Governor of Florida. On November 4, 2009, Dockery entered the race for Florida governor, challenging Florida's Attorney General Bill McCollum for the Republican Nomination. Dockery dropped out of the race when it became clear that she would be unable to run a competitive campaign against Rick Scott, who spent nearly $50 million of his own money to secure a bitterly fought Republican primary victory. After Scott's primary win, Dockery's name was floated as a potential running mate for Scott. On 30 August 2010, Dockery announced that she would not run for lieutenant governor at Scott's side.  Chronicle  Term limits prohibited Dockery from running for senate re-election in 2012, so when she was asked to write a column for the political discourse website Florida Voices to share her insights of Florida politics during her last year as a senator, she agreed.

It is located on Woodhouse Lane next to St John's Catholic School, and opposite Bishop Barrington School (now Bishop Barrington Sports with Mathematics College). Bishop Auckland College began life as a Technical Institute with classes being run in the Mechanics Institute in Victoria Avenue and other town centre locations. In September 1950 the Technical Institute was opened in the old Railway Offices, Station Approach. Enrolment in 1950/51 was 250 part-time day and evening students. Today that figure is almost 8,500. It was the demand for engineering courses needed by local industry that led to the first buildings for the Bishop Auckland Technical College (now Bishop Auckland College) on Woodhouse Lane. This was formally opened by County Alderman F. Hunt JP on Wednesday 26 February 1958 at 2.30pm.

A one-off reunion concert featuring all five previous members of the group was organised by Ted Carroll, head of Chiswick Records. At the time of this gig, Rudolph was also playing bass for Hawkwind whilst Wallis was playing guitar for Mot√∂rhead. The tapes were licensed from Douglas Smith for release in 1982, although only part of the concert was issued, the rest being deemed unsuitable for public consumption.Fairies Wear Boots ‚Äì Kerrang! 1983 ‚Äì HawkFanFare (Internet archive) It was pressed on pink vinyl with a cover by long-standing collaborator Edward Barker featuring a pig which had become the band's ident. The track \\"Going Down\\" is a cover of the Freddie King song, but was erroneously credited to Lou Reed on the original release. The actual concert included many live favourites from the Pink Fairies history not represented on the LP (which is in the wrong order anyway). Other songs performed at the concert included \\"Do It\\", \\"3/5 Mile in 10 Seconds\\", \\"The Snake\\", \\"Street Urchin\\" and \\"Bye Bye Johnny\\" plus a drum solo... poor recording quality led to a sadly abbreviated release. This was in truth the 2nd reunion of the year, the first having taken place in Feb 75 without the presence of Twink and generally considered the better of the two despite the Fairies non-headlining status at the earlier gig. Demand was so high that those locked out attempted to burn down the doors of the venue. The stage was 'enhanced' by a large polystyrene Mandrax tablet erected by the road crew and the distribution to the crowd of many cannabis 'joints'. Such was the reaction that the trio of Wallis/Sanderson/Hunter went on to tour at length after the second concert, Wallis juggling his commitment to Motorhead. When this album was released on CD, several unrelated bonus tracks were added. On the CD release, the first five tracks are from the live performance at the Roundhouse. The following six are a collection of previously unreleased tracks, recorded by the Pink Fairies. After this follows a further three tracks, credited as being created by \\"Twink & The Fairies\\" in fact a wholly unrelated project, the only other 'fairy' being Sanderson on bass for \\"Do It 77\\".

Seen by critics as the best release of Bride's hard rock era, Snakes in the Playground is commonly known as the breakthrough album in the band's career. This album would produce for the band more touring, press appeal, and two GMA Dove Awards for best song.Thompson, Dale. Chapter 9.Bridepub. Retrieved December 26, 2001 In 2010, HM Magazine listed Snakes in the Playground at No. 45 on its Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time list stating that it \\"best captured the apex of their live energy and great songwriting\\" and is \\"a turning point for the legitimacy of true hard rock in the Christian market (as opposed to overly premeditated/watered-down youth group filler). Snakes‚Ä¶ was to Bride what Appetite‚Ä¶ was to G ‚Äòn R.\\" Heaven's Metal fanzine ranked it No. 9 on its Top 100 Christian metal albums of all-time list. Recording The work on Snakes in the Playground began after the band arrived their home of Kentucky from the tour that followed Kinetic Faith, with the line up of Dale Thompson, Troy Thompson, Rick Foley and Jerry McBroom. Bride spent a great deal of time in pre-production fine tuning its material and eventually came up with two demo tapes of nine songs each. On this album the band tried to capture their live performance energy on the album, and ended up creating a rawer and more straightforward hard rock album compared to Kinetic Faith. The band has said that they did not want to work with the producer Steve Griffith, and ended up working with the New Jersey native, Plinky, who had previously produced for a band called Novella. The album was recorded at The Saltmine Studios in Nashville, and included several guest musicians: Peter and John from the Newsboys, Rick Florian from White Heart for back up vocals, Greg Martin from the Kentucky Headhunters, Rick Elias, and Derek Jan from Novella for some solo guitar spots. The band has said that they decided to name the album Snakes in the Playground after they had an incident with a large snake at the studio: Overview The album's output is a combination of energetic hard rock numbers such as \\"Rattlesnake\\" and \\"Would You Die For Me,\\" and more hook-laden, faster songs such as \\"Psychedelic Super Jesus\\" and \\"Don‚Äôt Use Me\\" as well as tracks that have elements of the band's metal roots such as \\"Fall Out\\" and \\"Dust Through a Fan.\\" The ballad \\"I Miss The Rain\\" has a similar feel as \\"Sweet Louise,\\" which is the closing song on Kinetic Faith. Dale Thompson's vocals continues to showcase his raspy and blues based output. Tracks such as \\"Fallout\\" and \\"Would You Die For Me\\" display his wider vocal range, while the ballad ‚ÄúI Miss The Rain‚Äù reflects a calmer vocal style. Troy Thompson's rhythm guitar work is more based on groove, and combines work with the guest musicians Dez Dickerson (Prince), Derek Jan (Novella), and Greg Martin (Kentucky Headhunters) for an abundance of gritty lead guitar work. Other guest appearances are made as background vocalists by Rick Florian (White Heart) and Newsboys, and Rick Elias plays harmonica. According to Dale Thompson, the lyrics on Snakes in the Playground were inspired by personal experiences and the letters the band received from its fans during the months before recording. The album's lyrics are based upon social problems from Christian point of view. The lyrics deal with subject such as drug abuse, suicide, abortion, gang violence, and other issues. \\"Rattlesnake\\" begins with an intro of a preacher stating, \\"Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart today\\" followed by wailing sirens as pounding drums fade away. \\"Rattlesnake\\" speaks against those who give drugs to kids in order to turn them into addicts. \\"Psychedelic Super Jesus\\" is about a band in Bride‚Äôs hometown of Louisville that In Dale‚Äôs words, \\"They see Jesus as a hippie guru living in the 1960s, but we know that is not who He is.\\" The band won \\"Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year\\" for the song \\"Rattlesnake\\" at the 23rd GMA Dove Awards in 1992, and for \\"Psychedelic Super Jesus\\" at the 24th GMA Dove Awards in 1993.\\"Dove Award Recipients for HARD MUSIC RECORDED SONG OF THE YEAR \\".

History The written history of Denton goes back to at least 1253, when the then-owner, one Athelstan (not to be confused with the king of that name), made the estate over to the See of York, which already owned manorial rights in nearby Otley. It was subinfeuded (sub-let) at an early date to the Vavasours, and in 1284 Maugerus le Vavasur held the town for a fourth part of a knight's fee of the Archbishops of York, who continued lords paramount. In 1379, according to the poll-tax returns, one Adam Wayte appears to have been then farming the manor, at which time Denton had a more than ordinary reputation for clothes-making and drapery goods. The estate passed into the ownership of the Thwaites family when Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Thwaites, married John Vavasour of Weston, who died in 1482; records show the Thwaites family had been resident in Denton village earlier than that time. Again through marriage, in 1515 the estate passed to the Fairfax family.History of Denton Hall - retrieved 4 September 2007 At the time of Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron, Denton Hall had repute as housing one of the best libraries in Yorkshire (some of which later made up a part of the Thoresby Museum; others, including the Dodsworth manuscripts made their way to the Bodleian Library at Oxford). Denton was the birthplace and seat of Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron, famous as a general and commander-in-chief during the English Civil War. The estate was eventually sold by Lady Fairfax, widow of the 5th Lord Fairfax, in 1717 to James Ibbetson, a member of an old Yorkshire clan which had grown rich from a Leeds merchant house devoted to cloth.Gentlemen Merchants: the Merchant Community in Leeds, 1700-1830, R. G. wilson, Manchester University Press, 1971 It is said that the sale was to pay off debts on her estates in Kent, but that the sale was made so recklessly that the price given for Denton was covered by the value of the timber on the estate. On the Ibbetsons coming into possession of Denton in 1717 they did much to improve the estate. Sir Henry Carr Ibbetson, Bart, as the first President of the Wharfedale Agricultural Society, specialised in the breeding of Shorthorn cattle. Later Ibbetsons were responsible for the erection of the second and third Denton Halls. By the marriage in 1845 of Laura, daughter of Sir Charles Ibbetson, Bart., with Marmaduke Wyvill, M.P., for Richmond, the Denton estate passed to the Wyvills in 1861. About 1902 the house was let, the furnishings being removed to the Wyvill's ancestral seat, Constable Burton, North Yorkshire.Gilbert 1978 I:288 It was again sold, to Albert Holden Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth in 1920, and then by him in 1925 to Arthur Hill, who made a number of alterations to the hall still evident today. It was most recently bought by the firm of NG Bailey in 1976, who have refurbished it, use it as offices and let out rooms for meetings and conferences. Architecture Denton Hall, September 2007 The current hall dates to the 1770s, with a cited completion date of 1778. It was designed and the construction overseen by John Carr, for Sir James Ibbetson, 2nd Bart. Twice before the hall had been burnt down through the (alleged) carelessness of servants, in 1734 and once rebuilt, again in 1743. This circumstance induced the builder of the present mansion to compose a Latin verse, which he had affixed in front of the building. It may be rendered as follows: :NOR WRATH OF JOVE, NOR FIRE, NOR SWORD, I FERVENT PRAY, :MAY THIS FAIR DOME AGAIN IN PROSTRATE RUINS LAY. Among the furniture supplied for Denton, the largest amount (¬£551) was delivered by Thomas Chippendale, born in the parish.Christopher Gilbert, The Life and Work of Thomas Chppendale (1978) vol I:287f. The other major supplier was the firm of Gillow of Lancaster; a small sum was spent with Ince and Mayhew. Film location Denton Hall has been used as a college for old people, and also was a location for two films: In the 1942 The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp by Powell & Pressburger, it is the seat of the Wynne family, whose daughter Barbara marries the eponymous Colonel. It is also a setting for the non-animated elements of the 1978 film The Water Babies.IMDB entry for Denton Hall - retrieved 4 September 2007 References External links *Denton Hall - website operated by the current owners Category:Houses completed in 1778 Category:Country houses in North Yorkshire Category:Wharfedale Category:Fairfax family residences Category:Grade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire ","title":"Denton Hall, Wharfedale"},{"id":"13098224","text":"Previously Unreleased is a 1984 album by the English guitarist Larry Wallis, released under the name Pink Fairies.

Career Uchenna Carol Ikejiani was born in Nigeria to an Igbo family. In autumn 1978, she auditioned to appear on Joe La Greca's album Montreal. In early 1978, Jiani recorded two tracks for the project, \\"If You Believe in Me\\" and \\"Higher and Higher\\". These were released on an EP, with her credited under her birth name. Glenn LaRusso of Salsoul Records convinced her to shorten her name from Uchenna Ikejiani to Carol Jiani Carol her middle name to make it easier for North Americans to pronounce. In 1980, Carol Jiani recorded two Sandy Wilbur- written pieces with La Greca, \\"Hit 'N Run Lover\\" and \\"All The People of the World\\". \\"Hit 'N Run Lover\\" was remixed by San Francisco-based Moby Dick Records for their Gold Standard imprint and would become Jiani's signature song, peaking at number 4 on the US Billboard Club Play Singles chart in 1981. On the heels of \\"Hit N Run Lover\\"'s success, Matra Records commissioned a complete album, also titled Hit 'N Run Lover. \\"The Woman in Me\\" was the album's second single but its B-side, the uptempo \\"Mercy\\", written by Pete Bellotte and Sylvester Levay which exceeded the A-side in popularity among DJs becoming another hit for Jiani. \\"Mercy\\", the only track on the album not composed by Sandy Wilbur, was recorded earlier by Judy Cheeks. A follow-up album, Ask Me was released the next year generating the singles \\"Ask Me\\", \\"X-Rated\\" and \\"You're Gonna Lose My Love\\". In 1982, Jiani recorded vocals for \\"Get Up and Do It Again\\". The song was a hit, as was the second version recorded by Mizz lead singer, Michelle Mills.Suzie Q album cover photos and credits-RFC\\\\Atlantic Records Jerry Cuccazella; producer At the end of 1983, she released her last Joe LaGreca production, \\"Touch And Go Lover\\" for the Canadian label Telescope. The song was also remixed by Step Pettibone and for the US by John Robie. A total of 7 songs was recorded but the album was not released. Two more singles were released, \\"Dancing In The Rain\\" and a cover of \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\". Eventually all songs were released in 1984 on a 12\\" in the UK by the label Streetwave. In 1984, Jiani moved to England and soon signed with Record Shack to record \\"Vanity\\" with producer Ian Levine. Barbara Pennington had previously recorded the track but declined to release it to focus exclusively on soul music. Jiani's \\"Vanity\\", released in 1985, was a hit reaching number 1 on the UK Hi-NRG Club chart. Levine secured her a deal with MCA Records, and she released \\"Such A Joy Honey\\". According to Levine, \\"Turning My Back And Walking Away\\" was to have been her second single for MCA until she was dropped from the label. MCA gave the recording to Levine and the single was quickly released by his Nightmare Records label in 1987. Levine and Jiani went on to produce a full album for Hot Records, The Best of Carol Jiani, featuring a re-recording of \\"Hit 'N Run Lover\\", as well as brand new material. Jiani returned to Canada to again work with Joe La Greca on her 1996 album, Superstar. It produced two singles, \\"Come and Get Your Love\\" and \\"Superstar\\". After Superstar, Jiani maintained a low-profile and released few recordings until the late 2000s, when she made another comeback by working with contemporary dance music producers like Laurent Pautrat and Mondo. Jiani also reunited with Ian Levine to provide vocals on the track \\"Work My Fingers to the Bone\\" for his album Northern Soul 2007. Levine and Jiani also recorded a cover of France Joli's \\"Come To Me\\". Early 2008 saw Carol Jiani recording new material with producers Chris Richards & Peter Wilson.

He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the sixth round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Clemson. He has also been a member of the Washington Redskins and Houston Texans Early life Davis was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and attended Douglass High School, where he rushed for 7,339 yards and 80 touchdowns in his career. As a senior, he ran for 2,389 yards and 28 touchdowns on 350 carries, including two games with 300+ yards. Davis has a brother Mike Davis who played for the Gamecocks. He participated in the Georgia North/South game and earned co-MVP honors as he scored the only touchdown to lead the North to victory. Davis received 5A all-state honors by the Atlanta Constitution as a senior, after being named honorable mention 5A all-state as a junior. He was also an honorable mention All-Southern team pick by the Orlando Sentinel. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Davis was listed as the No. 6 running back prospect in the nation in the class of 2005. He chose Clemson over Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana State, Mississippi State, Tennessee, and Virginia Tech. College career Already a starter in his true freshman season at Clemson University, Davis racked up 879 rushing yards on 165 carries and scored nine rushing touchdowns, which set the Tiger single-season freshman touchdown record. He had four 100-yard rushing games, most ever by a Tiger true freshman, and ranked first among freshmen in the Atlantic Coast Conference in rushing. Davis was subsequently named ACC Rookie of the Year, the first Tiger to win the award since Anthony Simmons in 1995. He was also a second-team freshman All-American by Rivals.com and third-team by College Football News, as well as an honorable mention freshman All-American by Sporting News. In his sophomore year, Davis rushed 1,187 yards (sixth highest total in Clemson history) for an average of 91.3 yards per game (5.85 yards per carry), 28th-best in the nation and third- best in the ACC. His 17 touchdowns tied a Clemson single-season record also held by Lester Brown in 1978, and was fifth-most in ACC history. Davis was one of ten semifinalists for the Doak Walker Award in 2006, and also earned First Team All-ACC honors. Clemson's leading rusher for the third-straight year (the first Tiger to do so since Raymond Priester from 1995‚Äì97), Davis ran for 1,064 yards and 10 touchdowns on 214 attempts as a junior. He ranked second in the ACC and 53rd in the nation in rushing average per game (81.8). Davis became the first Tiger running back to be named First-Team All-ACC in consecutive years since Terry Allen (1987, 1988). As a senior, Davis suffered separated shoulder in spring 2008 practices, and had arthroscopic surgery to repair. He failed to reach the 1,000-yard mark for a third consecutive year, as he only rushed for 751 yard and 11 touchdowns. However, he still led Clemson in rushing, becoming the first Tiger in history to do that. Davis finished his college career fourth in Tiger history in career all-purpose yards (4,309). Professional career 2009 NFL Draft Davis applied for the 2008 NFL Draft in January 2008, but withdrew his name a few days before the final deadline. He was automatically eligible in the 2009 NFL Draft, but his draft stock had taken a hit after his up-and-down senior season. Consistently referred to as a \\"one-cut, one-speed runner\\", Davis was projected as a late- round pick. He was eventually selected in the sixth round (195th overall) by the Cleveland Browns. Cleveland Browns On September 12, Davis was involved in a minor one-car accident and suffered a head injury. He was briefly hospitalized and released a few hours later. Davis was projected by many pundits to be a good under-the-radar player and a fantasy sleeper, however after appearing in the season's first three games, Davis was placed on injured reserve on October 3, after allegedly being tackled by a Cleveland Browns linebacker in practice and suffering a torn labrum. It was initially reported Davis did not have shoulder pads on while the linebacker that tackled him did. However, an investigation by the NFL concluded that the injury occurred in a \\"controlled environment\\" and no league policies were violated. On October 25, 2010, he was released by the Browns. Washington Redskins On October 27, 2010 Davis was signed to the Washington Redskins practice squad. During the Redskins' Week 11 victory over the Tennessee Titans, back up running back, Chad Simpson, suffered a broken foot during pregame warmups, Davis was then signed to the Redskins' roster the following day, November 22, 2010. He left the squad on August 15, 2011, after reportedly being unhappy with his playing time. The following day, he was placed on reserve/left squad. He requested and was granted his release on August 21. Houston Texans On September 28, 2011, Davis was signed to the Houston Texans practice squad. Detroit Lions On October 19, 2011, Davis was signed to the Detroit Lions practice squad. On October 21, he was placed on the practice squad/injured list. Personal life His brother, Mike Davis, is a running back for the Carolina Panthers.

His professional career began in 1938 after his graduation from Louisville Male High School. By 1941, he had been acquired by the Dodgers and was playing for their top affiliate, the Montreal Royals of the International League. With the outbreak of World War II, he served in the United States Army in the European Theater of Operations\\"Those Who Served,\\" Baseball in Wartime.com and missed the 1944‚Äì45 seasons. In he returned to Montreal and split catching duties for the Royals with left-handed-batting Herman Franks. The 1946 Royals, led by second baseman Jackie Robinson, won the league championship and the Junior World Series, but are famous as the first racially integrated team in \\"organized baseball\\" since the 1880s. Howell witnessed Robinson's constant battle against intimidation‚Äîespecially in the form of brushback pitches. \\"I was with Jackie on Montreal\\", Howell told Roger Kahn in 1953. \\"The way he was thrown at that year was unbelievable. Unbelievable and disgraceful.\\" Page 211 \\"You never saw anything like it\\", Howell said in a Los Angeles Times interview published eight months before his 1990 death. \\"Every time he came up, he'd go down!\\" According to Robinson biographer Arnold Rampersad, Howell was one of two Southern-born Montreal players (with Marv Rackley) who personally wished Robinson well on his promotion to the parent Dodgers in April 1947, Page 167 breaking the baseball color line. Major league career Howell also made his major league debut in 1947, but not for the Dodgers. On May 3, he was traded to the Pirates in a multi-player transaction headlined by former Brooklyn starting pitcher Kirby Higbe, and played his first game three days later, going hitless in three at bats against the Boston Braves' ace right-hander, Johnny Sain.Retrosheet box score, 1947-5-6 Howell and Clyde Kluttz served as the Bucs' two primary catchers in 1947 and Howell batted an MLB-career-high .276, but at the end of the season he was traded to the Triple-A San Francisco Seals, and spent in the Pacific Coast League. Selected by Cincinnati in the 1948 Rule 5 draft, Howell spent the next four seasons (1949‚Äì52) in the big leagues with the Reds, serving as their most-used catcher in both 1950 and 1951. But in 1952, the Reds traded for veteran receiver Andy Seminick and Howell appeared in only 17 games. In October, the Dodgers reacquired him for pitcher Clyde King. He played mostly at Triple-A in 1953 and 1954 (when he returned to the Montreal Royals), but spent the entire season on Brooklyn's National League roster. Playing behind Roy Campanella and Rube Walker, Howell got into only 16 games (13 in the field and nine as a starting catcher). But he batted .262, and participated in another memorable season that saw Brooklyn win its only world championship, a seven-game triumph over the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series. Howell did not appear in the World Series. Howell was sent back to the Royals for most of the campaign, but was recalled by the pennant-bound Dodgers in August for his final seven games of major league service. He collected three hits and started in four games, but did not participate in the 1956 World Series, a rematch between the Dodgers and Yankees won by the Bombers in seven games. Howell's career then continued in the minor leagues in 1957‚Äì58 before his retirement. As a big leaguer, he collected 224 hits, with 39 doubles, four triples, 12 home runs and 93 RBI.

Sir Frederick William Grey GCB (23 August 1805 ‚Äì 2 May 1878) was a Royal Navy officer. As a captain he saw action in the First Opium War and was deployed as principal agent of transports during the Crimean War. He became First Naval Lord in the Second Palmerston ministry in June 1861 and subsequently published a pamphlet Admiralty Administration, 1861‚Äì1866 describing his reforms which included, inter alia, the notion that all senior naval promotions and appointments should be non-political and should be discussed and agreed by the Naval Members of the Admiralty Board on a collective basis before recommendations were made to the First Lord of the Admiralty. Early career HMS Endymion which Grey commanded during the First Opium War Born the son of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey (a former Prime Minister), and Mary Elizabeth Ponsonby (daughter of William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby), Grey joined the Royal Navy in January 1819. He initially joined the fifth-rate HMS Naiad in the Mediterranean Fleet as a midshipman and saw action against pirates off Cap Bon in Tunisia in 1824. Promoted to lieutenant on 7 April 1825, he transferred to the fifth-rate HMS Sybille in the Mediterranean Fleet that month and then to the sixth-rate HMS Volage on the South America Station in September 1825. Promoted to commander on 17 April 1827, he was posted to the sloop HMS Heron on the South America Station that same month. Promoted to captain on 19 April 1828, Grey was given command successively of the sixth-rate HMS Actaeon in the Mediterranean Fleet in November 1830, of the fourth-rate HMS Jupiter on the East Indies and China Station in August 1835 and then of the fifth-rate HMS Endymion also on the East Indies and China Station in October 1840. In HMS Endymion he saw action in the First Opium War and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 24 December 1842. Grey took command of the second-rate HMS Hannibal in March 1854 and conveyed 10,000 French troops to the √Öland Islands off Finland before proceeding to the Bosphorus where he was deployed as principal agent of transports during the Crimean War. Senior command The second-rate HMS Hannibal which Grey commanded during the Crimean War Promoted to rear-admiral on 22 January 1855, and having been advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1857, Grey became Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope & West Coast of Africa Station, hoisting his flag in the third-rate HMS Boscawen, in April 1857. Promoted to vice-admiral on 5 August 1861, Grey became First Naval Lord in the Second Palmerston ministry in June 1861. In this role he did not seek a seat as a Member of Parliament and instead sought to make the role professional rather than political. He published a pamphlet Admiralty Administration, 1861‚Äì1866 describing his reforms which included, inter alia, the notion that all senior naval promotions and appointments should be non-political and should be discussed and agreed by the Naval Members of the Admiralty Board on a collective basis before recommendations were made to the First Lord of the Admiralty. Having been promoted to full admiral on 24 April 1865 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 28 March 1865, he resigned his post when the second Russell ministry fell from power in July 1866. Grey lived at Lynwood House in Sunningdale in Berkshire and died there on 2 May 1878.

It provides access to 1,500 hours of observing time on two 2-metre class telescopes located in Hawaii (Faulkes Telescope North in Hawaii) and Australia (Faulkes Telescope South in Australia). This time is dedicated to education and public outreach, mainly in the UK, but also for smaller, selected projects in Europe and the US. FTP has operated a UK-wide educational programme since 2004, and currently works with science education projects across Europe and further afield (e.g. USA, Russia, Israel), including many EU-based science, maths and ICT programmes. FTP specialises in providing physics and maths education and outreach via astronomy and space science, utilising the unique access it can provide to research-grade facilities. The basic philosophy is to engage learners in ‚Äúreal science‚Äù, making them active participants in a range of astronomical research projects, ranging from observations of the solar system to distant galaxies. Teacher training (both face-to-face and online) is a core component of the FTP educational philosophy, and project staff have been involved in professional development work both in the UK and overseas, with teacher training days being held in Moscow, Santa Barbara, Munich, Lisbon, Paris and several other venues in Portugal and Spain. FTP operates a broad range of educational programmes, with a strong emphasis on teacher training and engaging students with ‚Äúreal science‚Äù. A variety of research projects are currently being run on the FTs, with schools often participating in the role of data gatherers, particularly in long-term monitoring or short-term intensive studies or Target of Opportunity requests for transient objects (e.g. GRBs, supernovae, NEOs or X-ray systems in outburst). The project also provides extensive educational materials which can be accessed and downloaded free of charge from their educational resources website. These resources include astronomy video tutorials, online astronomy training, paper-based documents for use in the classroom, and pre-packaged data from the telescopes to use with the exercises detailed online. Robotic Telescopes The robotic telescopes used by the Faulkes Telescope Project are owned and operated by Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGTN). Users must register for an account via FTP and, providing they meet the criteria for an account (as explained on the FTP website), the account details will be emailed out to the registered user. Students and teachers can then go online and book time on the telescope and run their own 29-minute-long real-time observational session on one of the telescopes, remotely controlling it over the internet. These telescopes are the largest robotic telescopes in the world available for UK schools to control in real time. The project was the winner of the 2008 Sir Arthur Clarke Award in the category of Achievement in Education. The Faulkes Telescope Projects in cooperation with Hands-On Universe runs many student observing projects such as supernovae observations, asteroid observations, the Lifecycle of Stars project and Hickson Compact Group of Galaxies project. Details of these, and many more projects can be found on the Faulkes educational website.

He won the Prix de Rome in 1810 for The Wrath of Achilles. After having worked at the French Academy in Rome, he became known for the Death of Abel, exhibited at the Salon of 1817. Consequently, he received many orders and produced, notably, The Lord Descends to Earth to Establish his Empire and Spread his Good Deeds for the ceiling of the room of Illustrious Men at the Louvre, The States-General of Tours in 1836 and The Convention of Alexandria in 1837, both for the museum of history in the Palace of Versailles and Jesus Among the Doctors for the Church of Our-Lady-of-Loretto in Paris in 1840. He was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1837 and was later named a Professor at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts.

The Dodgers instead moved to Chavez Ravine in Los Angeles. First announced in the early 1950s, the envisioned structure would have seated 52,000 people and been the first domed stadium in the world, opening roughly a decade before Houston's Astrodome. The stadium, in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, would have been located at the northeast corner of Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, on the site of the Atlantic Terminal. It would have cost $6 million to build and been privately financed. It was never built. The general area eventually did become a sports venue, because Barclays Center was built across the street to the south from the Atlantic Terminal, in neighboring Pacific Park. Background The Dodgers were playing at the 32,000-seat Ebbets Field. Feeling that the stadium was too small for their needs, they wanted to move to a newer, more modern facility. Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley wanted to exploit new revenue streams to capitalize on the rabid fans of the Dodgers. O'Malley commissioned Norman Bel Geddes about renovating Ebbets Field and first proposed a dome. He also talked to Buckminster Fuller to design a domed stadium. New York City Construction Coordinator Robert Moses wanted to utilize open space in Flushing Meadows, Queens and build a city-owned stadium there for the Dodgers. This plot of land was eventually occupied by Shea Stadium and later, Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets. Moses also opposed the location of the domed stadium since it would have caused significant changes to the subway system. The source of debate today, the stadium proved to be an important reason for the Dodgers to leave Brooklyn in 1957 and settle in Los Angeles. Some think O'Malley purposely proposed a stadium that had little chance of being built and that he privately negotiated with the city while publicly touting the merits of the domed stadium. Others suggest that the domed stadium failed because of Moses' uncompromising personality. The Atlantic Terminal Mall now stands on the land where the stadium would have been built. Adjacent to the Atlantic Terminal, in the new Pacific Park development, is the Barclays Center, where the Brooklyn Nets began play in 2012‚Äì13; they were joined by the New York Islanders in 2015‚Äì16 and the New York Liberty in 2020. The outfield wall would have been the same distance from home plate to center field as down the foul lines (380 feet to all parts of the outfield); in effect, the wall would have formed one- fourth of a true circle. (This symmetry is found in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on the fields where the Little League World Series is played each August.)

It is a herbaceous strappy perennial plant to a metre high, with dark green blade-like leaves to 70 cm long. Blue flowers in spring and summer are followed by indigo-coloured berries. It adapts readily to cultivation and is commonly seen in Australian gardens and amenities plantings. Taxonomy It was first described by English taxonomist John Sims in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1802. Its specific name is the Latin adjective caerulea \\"blue\\". The genus name is derived from the Roman goddess Diana, with a diminutive suffix -ella. Dianella caerulea is highly variable species, with many forms found throughout eastern Australia. Six varieties are known from the Sydney district alone. The species is described as having seven varieties, having been revised by Queensland botanist Rod Henderson in 1987 for the Flora of Australia: *Dianella caerulea var. assera grows as a taller solitary tufted plant to 1.8 m high, and is found from Nowra north along the New South Wales coast and Blue Mountains into Queensland. *Dianella caerulea var. caerulea *Dianella caerulea var. cinerascens is a pale-grey leaved form to 0.8 m inland and north of the Sydney basin, from Putty northwest to Wollar. *Dianella caerulea var. petasmatodes is a more mat-forming variant, which reaches 2 m in diameter and 1.3 m high. It is found on the far north coast of New South Wales into Queensland. *Dianella caerulea var. producta is a taller variety to 1.3 m found from Nowra and Blackheath north through New South Wales and into Queensland. It has a greenish white to blue perianth. *Dianella caerulea var. protensa is a smaller variant up to 0.5 m high, which grows as a solitary tuft. It is found from Nowra northwards through New South Wales into Queensland. It is found in sclerophyll forest on sandy soils. *Dianella caerulea var. vannata is a taller variant to 1.3 m recorded from the Blue Mountains, the far north coast of New South Wales and Queensland. Description Habit Fruit Dianella caerulea is a strappy herbaceous fruit bearing plant to about 1 metre (3 ft) high, with a thick spreading rhizome under the ground. The bright green leaves have straight or toothed margins, and may reach 75 cm (30 in) in length and 0.3-2.5 cm wide. The small (1-1.6 cm diameter) flowers bloom in spring and summer (August to January); the perianth is pale to a dark blue, or green-blue, and the anthers at the centre are yellowy brown. These are followed by small roughly spherical indigo-coloured berries which range from about 0.7 to 1.2 cm (0.3-0.5 in) in diameter. These fruit are edible. Distribution and habitat The plant is distributed through a range in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, and Queensland. It occurs in a wide range of habitats, from coastal heathland and even sand dunes. Cultivation Image in Curtis' The Botanical Magazine Believed to have been first propagated in England in 1783, Dianella caerulea is commonly cultivated in gardens, and is sometimes seen as a low-hedging plant in public spaces and amenities plantings. It is very hardy and long-lived, and suitable for rockeries. It is tolerant of poor drainage and responds well to extra moisture. Plants attract fruit-eating birds and butterflies in garden settings. The smaller denser forms in particular have potential for small gardens. Plant Hardiness Dianella caerulea is a very hardy (snow and frost hardy) and long-lived plant once established. It can tolerate damp conditions but prefers moist well drained soil. It adapts readily to cultivation.

He made two appearances for the club in the FAI Super Cup but manager Roddy Collins decided not to sign the midfielder. Brennan then went on trial at Luton Town and this time was more successful, earning a two- year contract at Kenilworth Road. He made his debut for the club in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Wigan Athletic soon after. However, he never became a regular first team choice and in 2002 moved to Hitchin Town. Luton would prove to be his last taste of League football as he drifted around the non-League scene with spells at Stevenage, Grays Athletic, Lewes, AFC Wimbledon, Cambridge City, Chesham United and Hemel Hempstead Town in the following years.

George Heneage Lawrence Dundas CB (8 September 1778 ‚Äì 7 October 1834) was a senior officer in the Royal Navy. As a junior officer he came to prominence due to his brave conduct during a fire on the first-rate HMS Queen Charlotte. As a result of this he was appointed to the command of the sixth-rate HMS Calpe in which he took part in the Battle of Algeciras Bay in July 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. After serving for four years as Whig Member of Parliament for Richmond, he was given command of the fifth-rate HMS Euryalus and took part in the unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign in July 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars. He transferred to the third-rate HMS Edinburgh and landed troops at Viareggio in Italy in November 1812 later in that War. He went on to be Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland and became First Naval Lord in the First Melbourne ministry in August 1834 but died in office just two months later in October 1834. Naval career Early career Born the fifth son of Thomas Dundas (created Baron Dundas in 1794) by his wife Charlotte Dundas (daughter of William Fitzwilliam, 3rd Earl Fitzwilliam), Dundas became a lieutenant in the Royal Navy in 1797 and served for several years with the Mediterranean Fleet. HMS Queen Charlotte The first-rate HMS Queen Charlotte is shown on the left in this painting In February 1800 Dundas was aboard Lord Keith's flagship, the first- rate HMS Queen Charlotte. Dundas was junior to Lieutenant Lord Cochrane but Cochrane had taken command of Nelson's prize, the Genereaux, in late 1799 to take her into port; Dundas therefore became 5th Lieutenant of the Queen Charlotte. One month later, early in the morning of 17 March 1800, cries of \\"Fire\\" rang out throughout the vessel. Some hay lying under the half-deck had been set on fire by a match kept there for the signal guns. Dundas was in the forecastle where he organized fire-fighting efforts. Dundas led a party below decks where they secured the main and fore hatches and then opened the lower- deck ports and the sea cocks to flood the lower decks to prevent the fire spreading down. These efforts delayed the fire from reaching the two magazines. Dundas continued working below decks until some middle-deck guns fell through the deck. At about 9am Dundas climbed out the foremost lower-deck port and climbed up to the forecastle, joining the about 150 men there who were throwing water on the fire.James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 7 Despite the crew's exertions, the Queen Charlotte eventually blew up with the loss of 673 people out of its complement of 840 officers, men and boys, including the Captain and her first Lieutenant. Dundas however survived. HMS Cameleon By 14 June 1800 Dundas was captain of the sloop Cameleon. She and Salamine shared in the capture on that day of the Genoese brig Anima Purgatoria, which was sailing from Bastia to Salcolight. HMS Calpe Next, Dundas was appointed to the command of the sixth-rate HMS Calpe.Urban, p. 319. On the night of 27 October 1800, Francis Beaufort, inventor of the Beaufort Wind-Scale, had led Phaeton's boats on a cutting out expedition. They captured the San Jos√©, alias Aglies, of 14 guns, which they immediately re-commissioned under the name of HMS Calpe, the ancient name of Gibraltar. Although it would have been usual to promote Beaufort, the successful and heroic leader of the expedition, to command Calpe, Lord Keith chose instead to promote Dundas who not only was not present at the battle, but was junior to Beaufort.James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 56 Dundas was promoted to commander in December 1800. In July 1801 Dundas was in command of Calpe at the Battle of Algeciras Bay. After the third-rate HMS Hannibal grounded, Dundas, deceived by a signal from her, sent his boats to save Hannibals crew. The French detained the boats and their crews, including Calpes lieutenant, Thomas Sykes; after firing several broadsides at the enemy's shipping and batteries, Dundas and Calpe returned to Gibraltar.James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 118 In the subsequent second phase of the Battle of Algeciras Bay, the two Spanish first-rates Real Carlos and Hermenegildo fired upon each other during the night, caught fire and exploded, with tremendous loss of life. The British captured the third-rate St Antoine, with Superb and Calpe then assisting in securing the prize and removing the prisoners.James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 128 Rear Admiral James Saumarez promoted Dundas to post- captain on 9 August 1801 and Dundas took command of St Antoine, which he sailed back to England. Politics After the peace of 1802, Dundas entered politics becoming Whig Member of Parliament for Richmond in the 1802 general election but resigned in February 1806, using the device of applying to be Steward of the Manor of East Hendred, to take up an offer of a naval command again and to allow his brother Charles to re-enter Parliament. In February 1805, he was given command of the fifth-rate HMS Quebec. HMS Euryalus In January 1806 Dundas took command of fifth-rate Apollo class frigate HMS Euryalus.Winfield (2008), p.155-6 Euryalus was asked, along with HMS Ocean and several other warships to act as escorts to a large convoy bound for Oporto, Lisbon and the Mediterranean. Towards the end of 1807 Euryalus returned to England with Niger as escort to a convoy of several thousand troops under Sir John Moore from Gibraltar. She went into dock at Plymouth for a refit and was then stationed in the North Sea.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.421-3 She carried the Duke d'Angoul√™me from Yarmouth to Gottenburg and escorted the Baltic convoys through the Great Belt. In June 1808 Dundas discovered several vessels at anchor at the entrance of Nakskov close into the shore. He anchored and sent four boats to destroy them. They burnt two large troop transports and captured a gun-vessel armed with two 18-pounders and carrying 64 men. The enemy lost seven men killed and twelve wounded, as well as many drowned; the British had one man slightly wounded. During the same year Dundas went to Elbing, a small port in West Prussia about 60 kilometers east of Dantzig (now in Poland) to embark Princess Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy (the consort of Louis XVIII), the Duc du Berry and other members of the French royal family. He took them to Carlscrona in southern Sweden and, after re-embarking them at Gottenburg, finally to Harwich. Dundas was also involved in the Walcheren Campaign in July 1809 when a British armed force of 39,000 men landed on Walcheren. Euryalus joined the squadron which forced the passage of the Scheldt between the batteries at Flushing and Cadsand on 11 August 1809. Euryalus had no casualties although two men were killed and nine wounded in the other ships.James (1837), Vol. 5, p.136 Later she was stationed off Cherbourg under the orders of Captain Sir Richard King, and in November 1809 she captured the French privateer lugger Etoile of 14 guns and 48 men. In the spring of 1810 Euryalus escorted a large convoy from Spithead to Portugal and the Mediterranean and was then attached to Captain Blackwood's inshore squadron off Toulon. Early in 1811 Dundas temporarily took command of the 74-gun Third Rate Achille until relieved by Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis, who had transferred from Standard. Dundas then returned to Euryalus. On 7 June 1811 the boats of Euryalus and Swallow captured the French privateer Intrepide off Corsica after a long chase. She had a crew of 58 and was armed with two 8-pounders. Dundas became Member of Parliament for Richmond again at a by- election in 1812 but was defeated at the 1812 general election. HMS Edinburgh Porto D'Anzo, Edward Lear, 1845, Auckland Art Gallery In October 1812 Dundas transferred to the 74-gun Third Rate Edinburgh. In 1813 Dundas and Edinburgh were in the Mediterranean. On the morning of 5 October, Edinburgh joined Capt. Duncan of Imperieuse off Porto D'Anzo where he and Resistance, Swallow, Eclair and Pylades had been watching a convoy for some days with the intention of attacking it.James (1837), Vol. 6, p. 34 The place was defended by two batteries mounting three heavy guns each on the mole, a tower with one gun and a battery with two guns. During the attack in the afternoon, Edinburgh supported Eclair and Pylades as they bore up against the battery to the south. After the ships opened fire, landing parties brought out the 29 vessels of the convoy, 20 of which were laden with wood for the arsenal at Toulon. All the works were blown up. On 30 November 1812 Dundas was placed in command of a small squadron consisting of Edinburgh, Furieuse and Termagant which landed troops at Viareggio in Italy. Some 600 cavalry and infantry from the Livorno garrison attacked the British troops, who routed them, capturing two field pieces and a howitzer. From the prisoners they learned of the weak state of the garrison and asked to be re-embarked to be taken to Livorno. The British troops and Marines landed on the evening of 13 December and they occupied the suburbs of the town. Some 700 cavalry and infantry attacked the marines, who opened to let the cavalry pass through them. The marines charged, killing, wounding or taking prisoner between 250 and 300 men. Edinburgh had just three marines wounded. Post-war At the end of the war, Dundas left the Edinburgh at Genoa and traveled overland back to Britain. After retiring from the Navy in 1815, he became a Companion of the Bath that year. Dundas won a seat as Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland at the 1818 general election but was defeated at the 1820 general election. He again became Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland at the 1826 general election but was defeated again at the 1830 general election. He was also promoted to rear- admiral in 1830. Dundas became Second Naval Lord in the Grey ministry in November 1830; having been appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of York in 1831,. On 2 November 1831 he was appointed as Comptroller of the Navy and member of the Navy Board until June 1832 when it was abolished and its functions were merged with the Board of Admiralty. He was elevated to First Naval Lord in the First Melbourne ministry in August 1834 but died in office, unmarried, of apoplexy at Upleatham in North Yorkshire just two months later on 7 October 1834. He is buried at Marske in North Yorkshire. Fictional references A heavily fictionalized Dundas appears in several of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey- Maturin novels, as a close and the oldest friend of Captain Jack Aubrey, and as (anachronistically) the younger brother of First Lord of the Admiralty Viscount Melville.

She was the first Asian American reporter for the Associated Press, and the first Asian American female reporter for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin newspaper. Her nickname was \\"Jookie.\\" Early life Ah Jook Ku was born on April 24, 1910, in Kailua, Hawaii. She was one of 15 children in her family. She and her family grew up on the 'Ewa Plantation (Ewa Beach) in Hawaii, where her father worked as a luna (boss). Ku was Chinese American, a descendant of early Chinese immigrants to Hawaii. She attended Mid-Pacific Institute on a scholarship. Ku served as a high school reporter for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin while at Mid-Pacific. She earned a degree in education from the University of Hawaii in 1933. Following graduation from college, Ku graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1935, also on a scholarship. She was only the third woman of Chinese descent to graduate from the School of Journalism. Additionally, she became only the second Hawaiian \\"exchange student\\" to graduate from the journalism school. Ku was often involved with various university journalism clubs while in college. She often appeared on campus radio broadcasts and before community groups as an advocate for Hawaii. Despite her academic achievements, Ku's parents believed that girls did not deserve an education. She often recounted a story about how her father once considered selling her for a single bag of rice. Ku commented on her father's attitude towards education, \\"the head of the family wasn't eager about educating women.\\" Career Ah Jook Ku returned to Honolulu following her graduation from the University of Missouri. She began work at the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, where she had previously worked as a high school correspondent. Ku was hired by the Associated Press in 1943 during World War II, becoming the AP's first Asian American reporter. She remained as a reporter for the AP wire service until 1946. Ku left Hawaii for China in 1948 aboard the Pacific maiden voyage of the SS President Cleveland. She took a job at the information office of the Nationalist Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek as an English language editor. She was based in Nanking, China, for just 18 months at the position before the 1949 Communist Revolution forced her to return to Hawaii. Upon her return to Hawaii from China, Ku began working in the growing field of public relations. She worked at a number of organizations including the Hawaiian branch of the Salvation Army, the Hawaiian Chamber of Commerce and the Hawaii Employers Council. She ultimately worked as an information specialist for the Hawaii state Department of Education before her retirement in 1975. Advocacy Ah Jook Ku became executive director of the Honolulu Community Media Council in 1975, the same year that she retired from the Department of Education. The council had been founded as a nonprofit volunteer group in 1970. The group was created in response to a ban on reporters from the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser from press conferences by then Honolulu mayor Frank Fasi. Its purpose was to promote accurate and ethical journalism within Hawaii, support First Amendment rights and seek transparent public access to government information. Ku remained involved with the Council as executive director for 25 years. Ku was especially active in the 1980s, fighting on behalf of Hawaii's sunshine law. She retired from the Council in 2002. Ku was an original founding member of a group called \\"Save Our Star- Bulletin\\" in the late 1990s. The group was formed in response by an attempt by Liberty Newspapers, the former owner of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, to shut down the newspaper in 1999. The \\"Save Out Star-Bulletin\\" sued Liberty Newspapers in U.S. federal court and successfully blocked the closure of the Star-Bulletin. Awards Ah Jook Ku was awarded the Fletcher Knebel Award for outstanding contributions to journalism by the Honolulu Community Media Council in 2002.

After the poor defensive showing by the Red Raiders, Tech Defensive Coordinator Lyle Setencich resigned on September 23, 2007, ostensibly for personal reasons. Ruffin McNeill was appointed interim defensive coordinator. In spite of the loss, Tech's Harrell was honored as AT&T;'s player of the week for completing 46 of 67 passes for 646 yards and five touchdowns. The recognition took place during halftime of the ESPN college game (Southern Miss at Boise State) on September 27, 2007.

In the 2006 contest, fifth-ranked Texas barely came away with a 35‚Äì31 win over an unranked Texas Tech team. Two days before the 2007 game, oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 6¬Ω points. Texas center Dallas Griffin was determined to be out for the season due to injuring his anterior cruciate ligament against Oklahoma State the week before the Texas Tech game. Backup defensive end Eddie Jones and reserve safety Drew Kelson also missed the game, while linebackers Jared Norton and Sergio Kindle were listed as \\"questionable\\" and \\"probable\\", respectively. The Austin American-Statesman reported, \\"Defensively, Texas must hope that the injured are quick healers because it's a given that the Longhorns will need every available body against the Red Raiders. Texas Tech fields the most dynamic passing offense in the country, and the Red Raiders also stay on the field an average of 77.3 plays per game. Tech further frustrates a defense by often going for fourth downs. They've been successful on 14 of 23 fourth-down attempts this season. A year ago, Tech was one of three on fourth downs in a 35-31 loss to Texas.\\" On the first series, the Horns scored a touchdown on a pass from McCoy to Shipley. Their defense held Tech to a field goal. Texas' offensive tackle Tony Hills injured his leg and left the game on a cart. Texas scored another touchdown on a run by Vondrell McGee to create a 14-3 lead at the end of the first quarter. Tech's Graham Harrell threw a touchdown pass and Texas answered with a rushing touchdown. On the ensuing kick, Texas used a pooch kick which was tipped by a Texas Tech player. The Longhorns' special team recovered the ball to set up a short field for their offense to rush for another touchdown. Tech brought the game to 28-20 with another touchdown. Texas drove into field goal range but tried to throw a touchdown pass with 11 seconds remaining in the half. The pass was intercepted for a touchback and the Red Raiders ran a short play to run out the half. Jamaal Charles and tight end Jermichael Finley were injured in the second half but were able to return. In the fourth quarter, McCoy was on the sidelines nursing a cut on his head but he did not miss any snaps due to the injury. McCoy threw for four touchdowns and ran for two more. Both teams kept running their first team offense until late in the game; they combined for 47 points in the final 12 minutes and each scored a touchdown within the final two minutes of play. Tech attempted two onside kicks in an effort to come from behind, but Texas recovered both kicks. During his post- game press conference, Texas Tech's Mike Leach used most of his time to rail against the officiating crew for making what he felt were bad calls. He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lives in Austin, because they are incompetent, or possibly because the conference wants Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference. Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote \\"Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground. On the next play, a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty. Leach also wanted, but didn't get, a flag for roughing the quarterback.\\" The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported, \\"Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials, so Leach's actions leave him open to reprimand, fine or worse.\\" ESPN reported, \\"Big 12 official spokesman Bob Burda did not immediately respond to telephone messages seeking comment. Leach's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension.\\" On November 13, 2007, the Big 12 fined Leach US$10,000, the largest fine in Big 12 history. Leach also received a reprimand and was warned that further violations can result in suspension. In a Big 12 coaches' conference call that day, Leach added that he did not regret making any of the comments. Leach announced that he will appeal the fine. Tech alumni and fans began raising money to aid Leach in paying the penalty in the event that it was upheld. Optionally, the proceeds raised could be used charitably. So, just before Christmas 2008, Leach requested that the nearly $5,000 raised to that point be spent on 400 hams to be given free to families in Lubbock. Future donations were to go to the university or athletic department. Oklahoma Sooners. In the final regular season game for Texas Tech and final regular season road game for Oklahoma, the Sooners traveled to Lubbock. Oklahoma had led the series 11-3 since the first game was played in 1992. ABC broadcast the game live to the entire country. Previous games carried by ABC during the season were shown to only a portion of the market. This was the largest single-viewed game since Mike Leach began coaching at Tech. After starting at their own 20 yard line, Tech's quarterback Graham Harrell completed four straight passes to bring them to midfield. On the fifth play, Harrell's pass was intercepted by Lendy Holmes and returned for a touchdown giving Oklahoma the early lead. The Red Raiders answered on their next two possessions with two field goals to cut Oklahoma's lead to one point. On the Sooners' first offensive play, quarterback Sam Bradford handed the ball off to Allen Patrick who quickly fumbled. Bradford suffered a concussion when he tackled the Tech defender who recovered the lost ball. Bradford did not show any immediate signs as he played on the ensuing Oklahoma possession, but he later told quarterbacks coach Josh Heupel that he did not remember any of the plays from the previous drive and Bradford was benched for the remainder of the game. Bradford was replaced by backup Joey Halzle. Texas Tech scored a touchdown on each of their next three possessions. Late in the second quarter, the Red Raiders fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Oklahoma. Oklahoma was unable to score a touchdown but managed a field goal with less than ten seconds remaining in the first half. Tech went into halftime with a 27-10 lead. To begin the third quarter, the Sooners went three-and-out and the Red Raiders answered with another touchdown. On Oklahoma's next possession, they ran six rushing plays against three passing plays and managed another field goal. Tech missed a 51-yard field goal on their next possession. The two teams traded possessions for the remainder of the third quarter. The Sooners went three-and-out, the Red Raiders got a first down on the first play, then went three-and-out. Tech intercepted Halzle on the next possession and Oklahoma responded with their own interception on the following play. In the fourth quarter, Oklahoma began to chip away at Tech's lead. Halzle completed a 65-yard touchdown pass to Manuel Johnson with less than eight minutes remaining to make it a two-possession game. Oklahoma got to the Tech seven yard line on their next possession but failed to convert. On the following possession, they got to the Tech 14 yard line but again failed to convert. With less than a minute left in the game, Halzle completed a 47-yard pass to Juaquin Iglesias that set up a nine-yard touchdown pass to Johnson to bring the Sooners within seven points. The Sooners attempted an onside kick with 20 seconds remaining but Tech got the ball and ran out the clock. The Red Raiders were ranked 24th in the Coaches' Poll released the day following the game. Virginia (Gator Bowl) Texas Tech jumped out to an early 7‚Äì0 lead on a ten-yard touchdown pass from Graham Harrell on the Raiders' second possession of the game. Virginia answered by scoring 21 unanswered points, including two safeties when Harrell was called for intentional grounding in the endzone. Cavaliers' tailback Mikell Simpson also scored on a 96-yard run, setting an NCAA bowl record for a running back. The halftime score stood at 21‚Äì7. Tech scored a touchdown in the third quarter but did not allow any points, narrowing Virginia's lead to a single touchdown. However, Simpson caught an eleven-yard pass from quarterback Peter Lalich with 11:26 left in the game to make the score 28‚Äì14. With 7:54 left in the game, Texas Tech turned the ball over on downs just outside Virginia's goal line. The Cavaliers were unable to pick up a first down and, following a punt, the Red Raiders took over at midfield trailing by 14 with 5:32 left. Harrell engineered an efficient drive completing five of his eight passes on the drive, including a 20-yard fade to Michael Crabtree for a touchdown to make it 28‚Äì21 with 3:31 left on the clock. On Virginia's ensuing drive, Lalich was sacked and fumbled the football, setting up a one-play drive for Texas Tech‚Äîa four-yard touchdown run for Aaron Crawford. Virginia was again unable to pick up a first down and Texas Tech drove to the UVA 24-yard line, kicking the winning 41-yard field goal with two seconds left. The final score was Texas Tech 31, Virginia 28. Earlier in the season, Tech's head coach Mike Leach had been fined US$10,000 for criticizing the officiating during the game at Texas. Fans contributed nearly $5,000 to help pay it and the money was spent to give free Christmas hams to Lubbock families. So following the Gator Bowl, he joked when referring to the two penalties assessed against his team for intentional grounding in the end zone, \\"I felt like we had a back there on the one safety, but I don't comment on officiating.

While Sheriff, Oelrich was in charge of then Sheriff's deputy and future Congressional candidate Jake Rush, who challenged Ted Yoho for his seat in 2014. Florida Senate Elections In 2006, when incumbent Democratic State Senator Rod Smith opted to run for Governor rather than seek another term in the Senate, an open seat was created. Then-Sheriff Oelrich opted to run for the seat, and defeated Travis Horn in the Republican primary. In the general election, Oelrich faced off against State Representative Edward L. Jennings, whom he defeated by almost 10,000 votes, picking up a seat for the Republicans. Oelrich sought re-election to a second term in 2010, and was challenged by former State Representative Perry McGriff, who had previously run for the seat in 2006, but had lost to Jennings in the Democratic primary. Oelrich slightly improved on his performance from four years earlier, and defeated McGriff.

Oelrich was not alone in challenging Stearns; veterinarian Ted Yoho and Clay County Clerk of Court Jimmy Jett also ran. In an upset, Yoho managed to unseat Stearns, though Oelrich and Jett placed a distant third and fourth, respectively.

The route enters Arkansas from the west just north of the Arkansas River near Dora. It travels eastward across the northern portion of the state connecting the cities of Fort Smith, Clarksville, Russellville, Morrilton, Conway, North Little Rock, Forrest City, and West Memphis. I-40 continues into Tennessee heading through Memphis. The highway has major junctions with Interstate 540 at Van Buren (the main highway connecting to Fort Smith), Interstate 49 at Alma (the main highway connecting to Fayetteville and Bentonville), Interstate 30 in North Little Rock (the Interstate linking south to Texarkana and Dallas, Texas), and Interstate 55 to Blytheville. For the majority of its routing through Arkansas, I-40 follows the historic alignment of two separate United States highways. From Oklahoma to Little Rock, Interstate 40 generally follows U.S. Route 64 through the Ozark Mountains. East of Little Rock, the route generally follows the routing of U.S. Route 70 until the Tennessee state line. Route description Oklahoma to Little Rock Interstate 540/US 71 run south from I-40 at exit 7 in Van Buren, providing access to the larger city of Fort Smith.Interstate 30 begins at I-40/US 65/AR 107 and runs south ad I-30/US 65/US 67/US 167. I-40 enters Arkansas from Oklahoma at Dora in Crawford County. It heads east into Van Buren, giving access to Fort Smith as well across the Arkansas River to the south. Access is primarily via Interstate 540/US 71, which was built as a southern spur to Fort Smith in the 1970s. I-40 overlaps with US 71, forming a concurrency until the alignment of Interstate 49 breaks north to Fayetteville, Springdale, Rogers, Bentonville, and its northern Arkansas terminus in Bella Vista, with US 71 breaking away shortly afterwards at another interchange. The route continues to parallel US 64 into the Ozark Mountains by entering Franklin County and providing access to the Pig Trail Scenic Byway in Ozark. Interstate 40 runs through Clarksville (where it has a junction with US 64), passes over part of Lake Dardanelle, and meets Highway 7 in Russellville. I 40 continues to the east through Morrilton before turning south to Conway and Faulkner County. In Conway, I-40 forms a concurrency with US 65 at exit 125, which will continue until exit 153a in Little Rock. The highway also has another junction with US 64 and US 65 Business in Conway before passing Lake Conway and entering the Little Rock metropolitan area. Little Rock to Tennessee In West Memphis, Arkansas, Interstate 40 is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway. Now in Pulaski County, I-40 heads towards the south-southeast as it heads to the town of Maumelle. It continues towards this direction until it reaches Interstate 430, which provides access along the western side of Little Rock. Further southeast near the Arkansas River, the route has a high volume interchange as the northern terminus of Interstate 30 as well as concurrent routes with US 67/US 167; US 65 turns south at this intersection, breaking the concurrency formed in Conway. I-40 (now concurrent with US 67 and US 167) continues east for before the US 67/US 167 concurrency turns north as a separate northeasterly expressway. From this point onward, Interstate 40 begins to parallel US 70 rather than US 64, which was a more or less a parallel route until Conway. The interstate continues to the east to intersect the concurrency of I-440/AR 440 before entering Lonoke County. Passing through Lonoke, the route runs through rural Arkansas with straight alignments and relatively few junctions, forming an overlap with US 63 in Hazen and meeting US 49/AR 17 in Brinkley. Upon entering St. Francis County, Interstate 40 runs northeast to Forrest City, where it intersects with Highway 1. Continuing northeast, I-40 enters Crittenden County, where it intersects with US 79 at Shearerville and enters West Memphis. The highway continues to the northeast to an interchange with Interstate 55, which form a concurrency east for . I-40 continues east onto the Hernando De Soto Bridge over the Mississippi River. The Tennessee border is at the midpoint of the river, and Memphis, Tennessee begins at the east side of the bridge.

Chickenshed‚Äôs membership programme comprises four Children‚Äôs theatre groups and two Youth theatre groups for young people aged 5‚Äì21 years. They run Saturday and holiday workshops for ages 5‚Äì12 years and performance and singing workshops for adults. They also operate education courses in inclusive performing arts at BTEC, Foundation Degree and BA (Hons) Levels. Chickenshed was founded by teacher Mary Ward and composers Jo Collins and Anthony Filby in 1974. It began in a disused chicken barn in Barnet, which is how it came to be called Chickenshed. Mary Ward started teaching in 1966 and was struck by how much better the children she taught could be reached through drama than any other subject and those who struggled in other fields shone in an environment where the work was created to fit those taking part rather than vice versa. Chickenshed has a purpose built theatre complex in Southgate. The theatre has four performance spaces: The Rayne Theatre which seating 300, a smaller Studio Theatre, and Amphitheatre and a Bar/restaurant that regularly hosts music and comedy evenings. They also have a branch in Kensington and Chelsea. Since 2000, Chickenshed has established 19 'Sheds' in the UK and two in Russia. These Sheds have been set up and trained by Chickenshed but then go to run independently, linked to Chickenshed by a shared vision of inclusive practice and philosophy. We are always looking for organisations or consortiums of organisations to work with us to establish new 'Sheds' / inclusive community theatre groups. Chickenshed is registered as a charity under the name The Chickenshed Theatre Trust. In 1996, company founder Mary Ward was awarded the MBE for Services to the Arts followed in 1999, with a Creative Britons Award, to acknowledge her 25 years of work with the theatre, while co-founder Jo Collins was awarded the MBE in the 2001 New Year's honours, for Services to Music. Chickenshed has performed at a number of public events, including Queen Elizabeth II's golden jubilee celebrations in 2002. A show to commemorate 100 years of J. M. Barrie's children's story Peter Pan was staged by the theatre company at the Albery Theatre, London in 2004, in order to raise funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital. Chickenshed appointed Lou Stein as its artistic director on 4 April 2016. Music The first musical writers for Chickenshed were Jo Collins and Anthony Filby, who together formed Colby music, through which they published a collection of musicals that Chickenshed performed. The music team has since greatly expanded. In December 1997, Chickenshed released a single, entitled \\"I Am In Love With The World\\", performed by children from the theatre. At bookmaker's odds of 4/1, the song was one of the contenders to become the UK Christmas number-one single. However it reached only #15 in the chart, remaining in the Top 75 for six weeks. The song was included on Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute, a charity album recorded following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Diana had been the royal patron of the theatre along with Dame Judi Dench, who is also a great supporter, and it was one of her favorite charities. Late 2003 saw the release of The Chicken Shed Album, a compilation that marked the 30th anniversary of the theatre company. Contributors to the album included supporters of the organisation, such as Cliff Richard, Emma Bunton, Bob Hoskins and Kenneth Branagh, as well as three tracks by Chicken Shed itself. Jo Collins & Chickenshed recorded a song, \\"Talk Through Me\\" for the 2007 show tunes album Over the Rainbow, in aid of The Association of Children's Hospices.

It was first published in 1972, and was republished in 2006 by Loyola Press with an introduction by Robert Ellsberg and a series of study questions. Plot Most of the action of the novel takes place on an island monastery off the southwest coast of Ireland. It is set in the future, near the end of the twentieth century after the Second Vatican Council. The story tells of a young priest sent by the authorities in Rome to fully implement Church reforms in an Irish monastery that still celebrates the Catholic liturgy according to older rites. The young priest, James Kinsella, is initially opposed by the Abbot of the monastery, who tries to preserve his and his monks' way of life. However, the Abbot eventually recognizes the need for‚Äîand inevitability of‚Äîchange. The novel comes to a head when a confrontation between the Abbot and a senior monk, Matthew, nearly undermines the structure of the monastery. The Abbot is plagued by his own doubts in matters of faith. The novel ends on an ambiguous note as the Abbot prays for the first time in years, but in the face of the abandonment of their traditional way of life. Reception Critic Jo O'Donoghue describes Catholics as \\"in some ways a paradoxical novel\\". Like Moore, Kinsella is \\"a sceptic who respects the beliefs of others but also ... a traditionalist in his attitude to the aesthetic and mystery of belief ...[which] will all be lost under the new dispensation\\". Catholics, says O'Donoghue, \\"seems to envisage the ordinary Catholic, lay or clerical, merely exchanging a conservative hegemony for a liberal one. Both, ultimately, are equally tyrannical... In this novel, there is lacking that positive sense of the individual bearing witness to his faith... which emerges so strongly from Cold Heaven, from Black Robe and from The Colour of Blood\\". Movie version Moore also wrote the screenplay for the film version in 1973, which stars Trevor Howard, Martin Sheen, and Cyril Cusack. Theatrical adaptation Moore adapted his novel for the stage. The play premiered in Seattle at the ACT Theatre in May 1980. The University of Washington has a copy of the playscript. Gregory A. Falls directed a cast that included David Frederick White (as \\"Tomas O'Mallery\\"), Tony Amendola (as \\"Brother Kevin\\"), and John Aylward (as \\"Father Walter\\"). Criticisms The book has drawn criticism within Catholic circles for making the claim that it is possible for Catholic dogma to change, by portraying a fictional \\"Fourth Vatican Council\\" that has reversed the Catholic dogma of the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. This, being in conflict with the dogma of Infallibility, has caused the book to be unofficially considered heretical. In addition to this, several phrases within the book (and the later film) have been claimed to be comparable to rhetoric typical of a Sedevecantist sect, that is in schism with the Catholic Church.

He previously was a member of the Florida State Senate from 2010 to 2016 and a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2004 to 2010. He is a Republican . History Hays was born in Henderson, Kentucky, and moved to Florida in 1950. He attended Connors State College, located in Warner, Oklahoma, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1967. After that, he joined the United States Coast Guard, where he was a dental technician from 1967 to 1970. Hays later attended the University of Florida College of Dentistry, from which he graduated in 1976. He settled in Umatilla, Florida, and served on the Lake-Sumter State College Board of Trustees for six years. Florida House of Representatives In 2004, when the incumbent State Representative Carey Baker declined to seek re-election so that he could instead run for the Florida Senate, Hays ran to succeed him in the 25th District, which stretched from Howey-in-the-Hills to Debary and included parts of eastern Lake County, northwestern Seminole County and southern Volusia County. He faced Larry Metz, Johnny Smith, Randy Wiseman and JoAnn Huggins in the Republican primary. Hays was narrowly victorious over his opponents, receiving 35% of the vote to Metz's 29%, and advanced to the general election, where he was elected overwhelmingly over only write-in opposition. He was re-elected without opposition in 2006 and 2008. During a 2010 debate over legislation that required a woman to undergo an ultrasound before receiving an abortion, Hays controversially compared abortion to the Holocaust before he was cut off by the then-Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Larry Cretul, which prompted a Jewish member of the House to object. Senate When Carey Baker, whom Hays had succeeded in the House in 2004, decided not to run for re-election to his seat in the Florida Senate, Hays ran to fill the open seat in the 20th District, which included Lake County, southern Marion County, northwestern Seminole County, northern Sumter County and western Volusia County. He won the Republican primary unopposed and, in the general election, faced Eunice Garbutt, the Democratic nominee, whom he defeated with 67% of the vote. In 2012, the state's legislative districts were redrawn and Hays was moved into the 11th District, where he opted to seek re-election and which contained most of the territory that he had previously represented. He was opposed by the independent candidate John Iler, and campaigned on making Florida \\"a business-friendly state\\" by cutting regulations, improving education, speeding up the process for permits to be granted, keeping taxes low and creating an internet sales tax. Once again, Hays was re-elected comfortably, receiving 72% of the vote to Iler's 28%.  Supervisor of Elections  Following court-ordered redistricting in 2016, Hays opted not to run for re-election in his reconfigured Senate district, but instead to run for Lake County Supervisor of Elections, which was being vacated by the long time Supervisor Emogene Stegall. Hays won the general election with 55% of the vote, leading Democrat Christopher Flint with 32% and no-party-affiliation candidate Scott Larson with 12%. Controversies In 2011, during Florida's redistricting, Hays was heavily criticized when he made the statement, \\"We all know there are many Hispanic-speaking people in Florida that are not legal [...] and I just don't think it's right that we try to draw a district that encompasses people that really have no business voting anyhow.\\" His suggestion of a racially based double standard led to statewide criticism from fellow senators, representatives and the media. \\\\- During the 2013 legislative session, Hays sponsored legislation that would have banned public buses from stopping on streets after an incident in which he was driving behind a bus that pulled off on the side of the road to load and unload passengers, and he was unable to pull around it, which an Orlando Sentinel columnist called \\"absurd\\". In 2014, Hays wrote legislation that was signed into law by Governor Rick Scott that \\"gives county school districts final responsibility for selecting instructional materials\\", allowing parents to protest textbooks at public hearings on the basis that some books \\"unfairly presented foreign cultures and doctrines...in public schools\\". In July 2014, Hays announced his intention to introduce a bill requiring that all Florida public school students in middle or high school watch Dinesh D'Souza's film America unless their parents objected.

A lock-on is a technique used by protesters to make it difficult to remove them from their place of protest resulting loss of income for those affected. It often involves improvised or specially designed and constructed hardware, although a basic lock-on is the human chain which relies simply on hand grip.  Objective  In American protest movements dating from the 1960s and 1970s, the term lockdown applies to a person's attaching themself to a building, object, fence or other immobile object. The safe removal of the protesters necessitates the involvement of skilled technicians, and is often time-consuming. The lock-on chosen by the protester may be the difference between being arrested or not, or may vary the kind or number of charges brought against them by the police. If a protester can remove themselves when asked to by the police, they may stand a better chance of not being arrested. However, if they can remove themselves and they choose not to, they may receive a charge for refusing to remove themselves from the lock-on. If the protester cannot remove themselves, it is likely that potential charges are not as important to them as what they are protesting about. Locking on is a very successful means of slowing down operations which are perceived by the protesters to be illegal or immoral; it is also often used to allow time for journalists to arrive and record the scene and take statements from the group spokespeople.  Devices  Two protestors locked to a gate with a V arm tube. Lock-ons were originally performed with chains and handcuffs, but other devices have been introduced, including tripods and tubes or pipes with handholds built in to link a person to an object or to create chains of people. Other common hardware includes padlocks, U-locks and other bicycle locks, lockboxes and tripods and platforms and other rigging in tree sitting. A more complicated lock-on is the sleeping dragon, which involves protesters putting their limbs through pipes containing concrete, or a mixture of steel and concrete, and is only limited by the imagination and ingenuity of those making the lock-on. The protester can choose between a type that will allow them to willingly remove themselves or a type that requires machinery to remove them. Devices can be buried as an additional barrier to removal. A car dragon is a car concreted into place after removing the wheels, where protestors can then lock-on to a further device fixed to the car.

There are four distinct communities that identify themselves as Gypsies/Travellers in Scotland: Indigenous Highland Travellers, Romani Lowland Travellers, Scottish Border Romanichal Traveller (Border Gypsies) and Showman (Funfair Travellers). Lowland Travellers and Border Romanichal Travellers (Romani Groups) Lowland Scottish Gypsies/Travellers The ethnic origins of Scottish Lowland Travellers are not clear, but can be categorised into two main theories: 1.) They are Romani in origin and have a common ancestry with the English Romanichal, and their language and culture simply diverged from the language and culture of the Romanichal like what happened with the Welsh Kale. 2.) They are a fusion or mix of Romani and an indigenous Lowland Scottish Traveller group, and their roots are just as Romani as they are Scottish. Regardless of both theories, Lowland Gypsies are still viewed as a Romani group, with Romani culture clearly being a massive part of Scottish Lowland Gypsy culture. Lowland Scottish Romani Travellers share many cultural features with other British Romani Travellers (English Romanichal Travellers and Welsh Kale Travellers) such as a belief in the importance of family and family descent, a strong valuing and involvement with extended family and family events, a preference for self-employment, purity taboos (among the Romani people the purity taboos are part of the Romanipen) and a strong commitment to an itinerant lifestyle. They are particularly very closely related to the Romani groups of England, Wales, Norway, Sweden and Finland. They speak Scottish Cant, which is a para- Romani language (similar to Angloromani and Scandoromani) meaning that it is a mixed language. Scottish Cant is a mix of Scots and Romani. History There is written evidence for the presence of Roma travellers in the Scottish Lowlands as early as 1505, when ‚Äì during the reign of James IV ‚Äì an entry in a book kept by the Lord High Treasurer records a payment of four shillings to a Peter Ker to take a letter from the king at Hunthall, to the \\"King of Rowmais\\". Two days later, the King authorised a payment of ¬£20 to a messenger from the \\"King of Rowmais\\". In 1530, a group of Romanies danced before the Scottish king at the Holyrood Palace and a Romani herbalist called Baptista cured the king of an ailment. Romany migration to Scotland continued during the 16th century and several groups of Romanies were accepted there after being expelled from England. cited in: Records in Dundee from 1651 note the migrations of small groups of people called \\"Egyptians\\" in the Highlands, and are noted to be of the same nature as the English Gypsies. By 1612, communities of Romanies were recorded to exist as far north as Scalloway in the Shetland Islands.Scottish Gypsies Macritchie cited in The Finnish Kale, a Romani group in Finland, maintain that their ancestors were originally a Romani group who travelled to Finland from Scotland,Ethnologue website this is because Finnish Kale and Norwegian & Swedish Romanis√¶l Travellers are distantly related to present-day Scottish Lowland Romani Travellers, English Romanichal Travellers, and Welsh Kale, with all of these groups having common ancestry, being descended from the Romani who arrived in Britain in the 16th century. Romani people in the South of Scotland enjoyed the protection of the Roslyn family and made an encampment within the Roslyn castle grounds. However, as with its neighbour England, the Scottish parliament passed an act in 1609 against Romani groups known as the ‚ÄúAct against the Egyptians‚Äù; which made it lawful to condemn, detain and execute Gypsies if they were known or reputed to be ethnically Romani. Scotland has had a Romani population for at least 500 years; they are a distinct group from the Highland Travellers. Lowland Gypsies Romani Travellers share a common heritage with English Romanichal Gypsies and Welsh Kale. They enjoyed a privileged place in Scottish society until the Reformation, when their wandering lifestyle and exotic culture brought severe persecution upon them. Travelling groups from other parts of Britain often travel in Scotland. These include English Romanichal Travellers, Irish Travellers and Funfair Travellers (Showman). English Romanichal Gypsies/Travellers from the north of England mainly in Newcastle- Upon-Tyne and Cumbria commonly travel into the Scottish Borders. The annual gathering at Appleby Horse Fair could be considered part of the common culture that Lowland Scottish Travellers living in the Lowlands and Romanichal Border Gypsies living in the Scottish Borders share with the UK's other Travelling groups. Scottish Romanichal Travellers (Scottish Border Gypsies) It is also important to note that Romanichal Traveller communities exist in the Scottish Borders, they are linguistically (Due to speaking Northern Angloromani) and culturally (Due to following Romanichal traditions and customs) identical to the Romanichal Traveller communities in Northern England. They are known locally as Border Gypsies. They live in separate and distinct communities from Scottish Lowland Travellers, although both are Romani groups with Romani cultures, languages and heritage. Scottish Romanichal traders were upwardly mobile, by 1830 they travelled to the potteries in Staffordshire and buying china and other goods, selling the items chiefly in Northumberland, while based in Kirk Yetholm in Roxburghshire. By 1874 these Gypsies were commented on as \\"Having physical markers in their dusky complexion that is characteristically Gypsy]...and...[a language that is clearly Romani\\".Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society, Volume 2 by Gypsy Lore Society. Scottish Gypsies under the Stewarts Ch6, p175 Some Scottish Romanichal Travellers from the Scottish Borders are even members of Romani organisations based in England. Scottish Romanichal Travellers are known locally as Border Gypsies. Border Gypsies had a 'Royal' family, from an early date. The Faa family occupied this role until 1847 when it passed to the Blyths, commonly called Faa-Blyths. The last 'king' died in 1902 and there has been no more recent claimants. Besides the Faas and Blyths, common Border Gypsy (Scottish Romanichal) surnames include Baillie, Tait, Douglas, Gordon, McDonald, Ruthven, Young and Fleckie. http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/borders.html Scottish Cant (Also known as Scots-Romani or Scotch-Romani) The Lowland Gypsies speak a mixed language of Scots and Romani called Scottish Cant (Also known as Scots-Romani or Scotch-Romani) which includes many words of Romani origin, mostly Angloromani origin words. Up to 50% of Scottish Cant originates from Romani-derived lexicon.Wilde 1889 cited in Music and song *The Raggle Taggle Gypsies (1720) Donnie Munro's \\"Where the Roses\\" and \\"Queen of the Hill\\", from the album An Turas, are based on the author's childhood experiences with the Tinker People in the Scottish Highlands.

Poetically known as the \\"Summer Walkers\\", Highland Travellers are a distinct ethnic group and may be referred to as \\"\\", \\"'\\", in Scots, \\"tinkers\\", originating from the Gaelic \\"tinceard\\" or (tinsmith) or \\"Black Tinkers\\". Mistakenly the settled Scottish population may call all travelling and Romani groups tinkers, which is usually regarded as pejorative, and contemptuously as \\"tinks\\" or \\"tinkies\\".The Concise Scots Dictionary, Mairi Robinson (editor) (1985), p723 Highland Travellers are closely tied to the native Highlands, and many traveller families carry clan names like McPhee,Ian Grimble, \\"Scottish Clans & Tartans\\" p199 Stewart, Callaghan, MacDonald, Cameron, Williamson and MacMillan. They follow a nomadic or settled lifestyle; passing from village to village and are more strongly identified with the native Gaelic speaking population. Continuing their nomadic life, they would pitch their bow-tents on rough ground on the edge of the village and earn money there as tinsmiths, hawkers, horse dealers or pearl-fishermen. Many found seasonal employment on farms, e.g. at the berry picking or during harvest. Since the 1950s, however, the majority of Highland Travellers have settled down into organized campsites or regular houses. Adam Smith, the economist and philosopher, was reportedly kidnapped by Highland Travellers at a young age before quickly being freed. Language The Highland Travellers' speech includes a dialect called 'Beurla-reagaird'. It is related to the Irish Traveller Shelta as a creol of the Gaelic language group. It was used as a cultural identifier, just as Romani groups used the Romani language. However like the Highland Travellers themselves the language isn't related to Romani. Origins and customs The Highland Traveller community has a long history in Scotland going back, at least in record, to the 12th century as a form of employment and one of the first records of that name states a \\"James the Tinker\\" held land in the town of Perth from 1165-1214 and share a similar heritage, although are distinct from the Irish Travellers. As with their Irish counterparts, there are several theories regarding the origin of Scottish Highland Travellers, one being they are descended from the Picts, excommunicated clergy, to families fleeing the Highland potato famine, or the pre-Norman-Invasion, have been claimed at different times. Highland Travellers are distinct both culturally and linguistically from other Gypsy groups like the Romani, including the Romanichal, Lowland Scottish Gypsies, Eastern European Roma and Welsh Kale groups. Several other European groups are non- Romany groups, namely the Yeniches, Woonwagenbewoners in the Netherlands, Indigenous Norwegian Travellers and Landfahrer in Germany. As with Indigenous Norwegian Travellers, Highland travellers origins may be more complex and difficult to ascertain and left no written records of their own. As an indigenous group Highland Travellers have played an essential role in the preservation of traditional Gaelic culture.Travelling People ‚Äî Highland Travellers. Travellers' outstanding contribution to Highland life has been as custodians of an ancient and vital singing, storytelling and folklore tradition of great importance. It is estimated that as little as 2,000 Highland Travellers continue to lead their traditional lifestyle on the roads.

(nephew of Jeannie Robertson) In popular culture * Rob Roy ‚Äî 1995 film featuring Liam Neeson that details the exploits of the early 18th century Scottish clan chief and outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor. The film opens with MacGregor and his clansmen retrieving 32 stolen head of cattle from a band of Travellers led by Tam Sibbalt. After killing Sibbalt, MacGregor disarms the others, whom he calls \\"Tinkers\\", and allows them to go. After his return home, Mary MacGregor (Jessica Lange), expresses shock when her husband expresses sympathy for the Travellers, saying that they once had families and Clans to which they belonged. She is even more shocked when he compares the Travellers' poverty with that of their own Clan. She insists, \\"The MacGregors were never Tinkers.\\" In response, Rob tells her that many MacGregors are only one bad winter away from joining the Travellers. He explains that his greatest fear is of finding some of his Clansmen among them. * Death Defying Acts ‚Äî a film about Harry Houdini and his encounter with a Scottish traveller woman and her daughter.Amber Wilkinson, Death Defying Acts: Movie Review.

Fairground travellers 200px Travelling funfair showmen are a community of travellers officially called occupational Travellers, that can be categorised broadly defined as a business community of travelling show, circus communities and fairground families. Occupational travellers travel for work across Scotland, the rest of the UK and into Europe. The Show/Fairground community is close knit, with ties often existing between the older Romanichal families, although showmen families are a distinct group and have a vibrant social scene centered both around the summer fairs and the various sites and yards used as winter quarters. Many Scottish show and fairground families live in winter communities based mainly in the east end of Glasgow. Housing an estimated 80% of all showfamilies Glasgow is believed to have the largest concentration of Showmen quarters in Europe, centred mostly in Shettleston, Whiteinch and Carntyne. Showmen families have a strong cultural identity as ‚ÄòBritish Showmen‚Äô, dating back to 1889 and the formation of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain and Ireland, and are known within the UK as the ‚ÄúScottish Section‚Äù. As with other showmen communities they call non-travellers (but not other non related travelling groups including Romanichal, Roma, Scottish Lowland Travellers, Highland Travellers or Irish Travellers) as ‚ÄúFlatties‚Äù or non-\`showmen‚Äô in their own Polari language. The label of \\"Flattie-Traveller\\" can include showmen who have left the community to settle down and lead a sedentary lifestyle. History Fairs in Scotland have been held from the early Middle Ages, and traditionally brought together the important elements of medieval trade and a festival. Many of the common markets and fairs are rooted in ancient times, from the medieval period or earlier, and are said to be 'prescriptive fairs'. Other fairs will have been granted a royal charter to cement their importance and secure their future, and these are known as Charter fairs. In the Middle Ages the Royal charters gave the fairs legal status and developed their economic importance. The majority of fairs held in Scotland and the rest of the British Isles can trace their ancestry to charters granted in the medieval period. Traders would travel long distances to sell their goods, as did travelling musicians and entertainers who kept both the traders and customers entertained. In the thirteenth century, the creation of fairs by royal charter was widespread. Between 1199 and 1350 charters were issued granting the rights to hold markets or fairs. Kirkcaldy links market remains the premier funfair in Scotland, evolving from a charter granted by Edward I in 1304. By the early 18th century the main aspect of these Scottish charter fairs had diminished and shifted to that of amusement with the advent of technology, and had evolved into the modern day travelling fairs. The modern travelling showmen have as strong a family history and heritage as do their counterparts in Wales, England and Ireland. Fairs in Scotland are presented around the same time as they are in the rest of Great Britain and Ireland with a similar mixture of Charter, Prescriptive and private business fairs. The run of fairs include Buckie fair, Inverness, Kirkcaldy links market and the historic fairs held at Dundee and Arbroath. Annually a team of young showmen from both Scotland and England play an ‚Äúinternational football match‚Äù known as the international,Worlds Fair. where trophies and caps are held in high esteem. A Showman newspaper; World's Fair is in circulation and available to showmen and non showmen alike. Language The use of slang used by Showmen or Parlyaree, is based on a cant slang spoken throughout the U.K. by Scottish, English, Welsh and Irish showfamilies. It is a mixture of Mediterranean Lingua Franca, Romany, Yiddish, Cant London slang and backslang. The language has been spoken in fairgrounds and theatrical entertainment since at least the 17th century.Partridge, Eric (1937) Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English As theatrical booths, circus acts and menageries were once a common part of European fairs it is likely that the roots of Polari/Parlyaree lie in the period before both theatre and circus became independent of the fairgrounds. The Parlyaree spoken on fairgrounds tends to borrow much more from Romany, as well as other languages and argots spoken by other travelling groups, such as cant and backslang.

He served on the Orange County Commission for District 2 from 2014 until March 2018 when he won election for mayor of Apopka. History Nelson was born in Orlando and attended the University of Florida, where he graduated with a degree in ornamental horticulture in 1979. After graduation, he returned to Central Florida, where he worked in his family's business, Nelson's Florida Roses. Nelson then started Nelson Insurance Services in 1995 as a means of providing his family's business with insurance, and it expanded from there. In 2002, he was appointed to the Orange County Planning and Zoning Commission, and served as its chairman in 2006. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Fred Brummer was unable to seek another term in the legislature and instead opted to run for the Orange County Commission, Nelson ran to succeed him in the 38th District, which was based in northern Orange County, stretching from Apopka to Ocoee, Orlando, and Maitland. He won the Republican primary and the general election entirely uncontested. In 2008, he faced his first opponents: Lonnie Thompson, the Democratic nominee, and Lawrence Fisher, an independent candidate. The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Thompson over Nelson, observing, \\"[H]e better appreciates the important issues facing the district than does his opponent,\\" and criticizing Nelson for not protecting the Wekiva River and for not supporting property-insurance reforms. Despite this fact, Nelson won his second term over Thompson by a solid margin of victory, winning 54% of the vote to Thompson's 43% and Fisher's 3%. When Nelson ran for a third term in 2010, he did not face a Democratic opponent, but instead a member of the Florida Tea Party, James Heinzelman. Nelson ran on a platform of \\"repealing parts of SB 550, which would impose a five-year inspection schedule on septic tanks,\\" which he said would lead to a \\"bureaucratic and costly nightmare\\" and on supporting SunRail, which Heinzeilman vocally opposed. Ultimately, Heinzelman did not prove to be a significant challenge for Nelson, and he won re-election with 82% of the vote. In 2012, when the legislative districts were redrawn, Nelson was moved into the 31st District, which, like his previous district, was based in Apopka, but unlike his previous district, stretched into northern Lake County and won re-election to his fourth term entirely unopposed. Orange County Commission In 2013, Nelson announced that he would run for the Orange County Commission in District 2 to replace term-limited Commissioner Fred Brummer, whom he previously replaced in the legislature. He was able to defeat his Democratic opponent, Vice Mayor Alvin Moore, Sr. of Eatonville, Florida in the general election process in 2014.

The skull of the giant predatory pliosaur Rhomaleosaurus cramptoni: implications for plesiosaur phylogenetics. Naturwissenschaften e-published 2008. Etymology In short, the term Leptocleidus means \\"slender clavicle\\". It comes from a merge of the Greek words ŒªŒµœÄœÑŒøœÉ, meaning \\"slender\\" and Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒ¥ (also spelled Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπœÉ) meaning clavicle. Description Leptocleidus sp. With large clavicles and interclavicle and small scapulae, Leptocleidus resembled the Early Jurassic Rhomaleosaurus and members of the Cretaceous family, Polycotylidae. The animal had 21 teeth on either side of its maxilla and approximately 35 teeth on each side of the mandible. The Leptocleidus' triangle-shaped skull had a crest running from a ridge on the end of the nose to the nasal region. Differing from other pliosaurids, Leptocleidus had single-headed cervical ribs and a deep depression in the centra of the neck vertebrae. Leptocleidus was on an average of 3 meters (10 feet) long. Leptocleidus superstes however, was found to be almost 50% smaller (1.5m, 5 ft) making it the smallest known species. Distribution and habitat Leptocleidus, unlike many pleisiosaurs, lived in shallow lagoons and likely visited brackish and fresh water systems (such as the mouths of large rivers). This led Arthur Richard Ivor Cruickshank to infer that this movement to fresh water was an attempt to flee larger plesiosaurs and pliosaurs. Most species are known from The British Isles but L. capensis was discovered in Cape Province, South Africa. Species Leptocleidus is known from the following sediments: *L. capensis is known from the Sundays River Formation (Valanginian age), Cape Province, South Africa. *L. clemai found near Kalbarri in the Carnarvon Basin (Hauterivian-Barremian age) Western Australia. *L. superstes is known from the Upper Weald Clay (Barremian age), Sussex, England. A specimen from the Vectis Formation (lower Aptian age), Isle of Wight, found in 1995 and seen as a \\"Leptocleidus sp.\\", was named as a separate genus Vectocleidus in 2012.

History Precourt attended the University of Florida, where he graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1983. Following graduation, he worked as a transportation engineer in Central Florida, eventually becoming a principal at the Dyer, Riddle, Mills & Precourt. He served on the Orange County Development Advisory Board, including several years as its Chairman. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Randy J. Johnson was unable to seek re-election in 2006, Precourt ran in the Republican primary to succeed him in the 41st District, which included southeastern Lake County, western Orange County, and northwestern Osceola County. He faced Dennis Horton and Joe Durek in the primary, and the Orlando Sentinel, which endorsed Horton, criticized Precourt for sounding like a libertarian for his \\"wish to take a cleaver to all regulations save those involving the public's welfare.\\" Ultimately, Precourt emerged victorious in the primary, defeating Horton and Durek with 50% of the vote. He advanced to the general election, where he encountered Bill McManus, the Democratic nominee and a former state legislator from Massachusetts. During the campaign, McManus attacked Precourt for violating campaign contribution laws, while Precourt criticized McManus for living outside the district. In the end, it was not a close race, and Precourt won his first term comfortably with 58% of the vote. He won re-election entirely unopposed in 2008. In 2010, he was opposed by Lee Douglas, the Democratic nominee, and Jon Foley, the Florida Tea Party nominee. The Sentinel endorsed his opponent, criticizing him for acting as an \\"eager proponent of the House's sometimes extreme agenda,\\" specifically condemning him for stopping \\"a needed Republican-sponsored bill in the Senate that would have curbed scandalous behavior at the state's Public Service Commission.\\" In 2012, when the legislative districts were redrawn, Precourt was moved to the 44th District, which included much of the district that he had previously represented. He was entirely unopposed in the primary and the general elections, and won his final term in the legislature uncontested. Following the resignation of Max Crumit, the Director of the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority, Precourt applied to fill the vacancy, despite the fact that he did not meet a requirement that \\"the new director should have run a toll-road system for eight years.\\". Additionally, Precourt's appointment could potentially violate the state's ethics laws, as it is illegal for legislators to take a job \\"with another public agency.\\" Despite this fact, the search committee responsible for replacing Crumit named him as one of six finalists for the job, and scheduled an interview with him on November 21, 2013. Precourt was offered the position by the Expressway Authority for a five year period, divided up by year-long contracts, and resigned from the legislature on January 9, 2014, in anticipation of accepting the position, but Ninth Circuit State Attorney Jeff Ashton, who was investigating the Authority, asked them to modify the offer. Instead, Precourt was offered a series of month-long contracts, and he withdrew his acceptance of the offer and blasted the Authority, declaring, \\"It is clear that the board has repudiated my agreement and terminated my employment effective immediately.\\" References External links *Florida House of Representatives - Steve Precourt Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives ","title":"Steve Precourt"},{"id":"13099651","text":"Bath is maudlin of the Well's second album.

Early life, education, & legal career Kriseman was born in Detroit, Michigan and moved with his family to Florida in 1972. He attended Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport. He then matriculated to the University of Florida, graduating with a bachelor's degree in broadcasting in 1984. Following graduation, Kriseman attended the Stetson University College of Law, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1987. He was active in local politics, serving as a charter member of the Lake Pasadena Neighborhood Association and working as State Representative Lars Hafner's campaign manager.

Political career He served on the St. Petersburg Nuisance Abatement Board in 1996.Rick Kriseman's Biography - Vote Smart St. Petersburg City Council Kriseman ran for a seat on the St. Petersburg City Council in 1999, challenging incumbent City Councilman Robert Kersteen. Though voter turnout was low, the city's purchase of the Sunken Gardens, which was on the ballot as a referendum, increased voter enthusiasm about the election and Kriseman lost to Kersteen by a wide margin, receiving 41% of the vote to Kersteen's 59%. When Kersteen resigned from the City Council to unsuccessfully run for the State House in 2000, Kriseman was appointed to replace him. Several months later he ran for re-election in 2001, just and faced Dennis Homol, Sr., a wastewater treatment plant mechanic. Kriseman campaigned on his plans to raise the city's quality of life by promoting economic development and effective law enforcement, and expressed his support for an ordinance to ease regulations for homeowners seeking to add bedrooms to their homes, while Homol campaigned on his support for building desalination plants. Kriseman won re-election over Homol in a landslide, winning 76% of the vote to Homol's 24%. He ran for re-election in 2003, facing challenger Homol once again, who attacked Kriseman and the City Council for being too friendly and not debating enough. Kriseman disputed Homol's assertion, pointing out that he regularly voted against Mayor Rick Baker, specifically when he voted against a mayoral pay raise and when he voted for allowing alcohol sales on Sundays. He campaigned on a \\"progressive\\" vision for the city, which included support for \\"pedestrian safe zones, land-banking, live Internet access to council meetings and creative use of swimming pools such as holding \\"dog paddles\\" so people can bring their pets to swim,\\" noting that government can be \\"about creating opportunities for fun, too.\\" Once again, Kriseman won re-election overwhelmingly over Homol, and received 76% of the vote again. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Charlie Justice opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, Kriseman ran to succeed him in the 53rd District, which included parts of Gulfport, Lealman, Pinellas Park, and St. Petersburg in southern Pinellas County. He was challenged in the Democratic primary by commercial attorney Charlie Gerdes. Kriseman and Gerdes both campaigned positively throughout the election, with both candidates agreeing on education and property insurance. Kriseman, however, emphasized his progressive credentials, noting that he was \\"socially liberal,\\" and expressed his support for higher teacher pay, smaller classroom sizes, mandatory community service for high school students, and the Save our Homes cap. Ultimately, Kriseman ended up defeating Gerdes by a wide margin, receiving 64% of the vote to Gerdes' 36%, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Thomas Piccolo, the Republican nominee and a former student body president at University of South Florida St. Petersburg. Kriseman and Piccolo both emphasized their legislative experience, with Kriseman drawing upon his tenure on the City Council's Legislative Affairs and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee, where he pushed for legislation that would benefit the city. Owing to the liberal nature of the district, the contest was not close, and Kriseman won his first term easily, receiving 60% of the vote to Piccolo's 40%. During his first term in the legislature, he authored legislation that would have put a $1 tax on strip club admissions to increase Medicaid allowances for seniors from $35 per month to $70 per month and legislation that would have required drivers \\"to stop at certain intersections when a pedestrian is either in, or steps into, a crosswalk.\\" When the state's no-fault automobile insurance law was set to expire before the legislature could renew it, Kriseman urged then-Governor Charlie Crist to convene a special session to renew the law, but Crist declined to do so. Kriseman was re-elected without opposition in 2008. In 2010, he won the Democratic primary uncontested, and faced Thomas Cuba, the Republican nominee, in the general election. Cuba did not present a significant challenge to Kriseman, and he won re-election with 59% of the vote. He opted against seeking re-election in 2012, declaring, \\"I've been in office for 12 years, the last six in Tallahassee, and it's been extremely challenging and frustrating being up there fighting a system that I think is broken. It's time to come home and focus on my family and law practice, and figure out what is next for me in politics.\\" Mayor of St. Petersburg After retiring from the legislature, Kriseman announced that he would challenge incumbent Mayor Bill Foster in the 2013 St. Petersburg mayoral election. Kriseman cited Foster's lack of leadership, the handling of the Tampa Bay Rays' desire to leave Tropicana Field, and issues with the St. Petersburg Pier as reasons for his mayoral run. Former City Councilwoman and two-time mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford, along with minor candidates Anthony Cates and Paul Congemi also joined Kriseman to challenge Foster. Kriseman and Ford attacked Foster for changing his position on a number of issues, while Kriseman was attacked by Ford for not passing any legislation while in the legislature. Ford also questioned whether Kriseman would be partisan as mayor. The Tampa Bay Times, criticizing Foster's \\"lack of vision and unsure footing,\\" strongly endorsed Kriseman, citing his \\"stabilizing influence\\" on the City Council and his focus on \\"environmental efforts and public education\\" in the legislature. The Times praised the \\"new energy\\" that Kriseman would bring to the mayor's office in negotiating with the Rays, redeveloping the Pier, and improving city services. The Tampa Tribune, meanwhile, though asserting that Foster's term consisted of \\"four bumpy years,\\" and praising Kriseman for his \\"command of the issues, which he presents with enthusiasm and energy,\\" endorsed Foster, observing that he presided over an \\"economic rebirth.\\" In the primary, Foster narrowly edged out Kriseman to place first, though no candidate received a majority. Foster won 41% of the vote to Kriseman's 39% and Ford's 19%, and Foster and Kriseman advanced to the general election. Once again, the Times endorsed Kriseman, and the Tribune endorsed Foster, while United States Senator Bill Nelson, former Governor Charlie Crist, and six out of eight City Councilmembers endorsed Kriseman. Despite the closeness of the campaign, Kriseman ultimately upset Foster by a fairly solid margin, winning 56% of the vote to Foster's 44%. In December 2015, Kriseman received media attention after he tweeted about \\"barring\\" Donald Trump from entering St. Petersburg, which he did in response to Trump‚Äôs earlier controversial comment on banning all Muslims from entering the U.S. in the wake of deadly terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Kriseman announced that he would run for re-election in the 2017 St. Petersburg mayoral election. In August 2017, Barack Obama endorsed Kriseman for re-election as mayor of St. Petersburg.http://www.newsweek.com/rick-kriseman-obama-breaks-silence- endorses-mayoral-candidate-florida-655393 On November 7, 2017, Kriseman was re-elected for a second term, winning the general election with 51.62% of the vote. He defeated former Republican Mayor Rick Baker, who had 48.38% of the vote in a nonpartisan election. Personal life He and his wife Kerry have two children.

Like minutemen in other British colonies, the men drilled in military tactics and trained to respond to emergencies \\"at a minute's notice\\". Organization The Culpeper Minutemen were organized on July 17, 1775 in the district created by the Third Virginia Convention consisting of the counties of Orange, Fauquier and Culpeper. Recruitment began in September 1775 with four companies of 50 men from Fauquier and Culpeper counties each and two companies of 50 men from Orange county. The District Committee of Safety determined that the militia was to meet under a large oak tree in \\"Clayton's old field\\" on the Catalpa estate near today's Yowell Meadow Park in Culpeper, Virginia. Engagements The Culpeper minutemen fought for the patriot side in the first year of the American Revolution, and are remembered for their company flag: a white banner depicting a rattlesnake, featuring the phrases \\"Liberty or Death\\" and \\"Don't Tread on Me\\". At the time, Culpeper was considered frontier territory. In October 1775, the minutemen were sent to Hampton in response to British ships attempting to land. The riflemen were able to effectively shoot the men manning the ships cannons, and the fleet eventually sailed away. The Culpeper militia next participated in the Battle of Great Bridge in December 1775. The battle was a complete American victory. There were accounts of the battle that suggested the British were unnerved by the reputation of the frontiersmen. The Culpeper Minutemen disbanded in January 1776 under orders from the Committee of Safety. Many of the minutemen continued to serve. Some joined the continental line, and others fought under Daniel Morgan, such as William Lloyd, who lived from 1748 to 1834. After fighting in Morgan's group, he joined the 11th Virginia Regiment and encamped at Valley Forge; he was honorably discharged at Fort Sullivan in 1779. William died May 2, 1834, in Kentucky. John Marshall, the fourth Chief Justice of the United States, was a member of the original Culpeper Minutemen. American Civil War In 1860, the Culpeper Minutemen were formed under the same oak tree where the 1775 Minutemen had organized. They also carried the same rattlesnake flag. The unit became part of Company B, 13th Virginia Infantry and served in the Confederate States Army for the duration of the American Civil War. Later Minutemen According to the Museum of Culpeper History, the Minutemen were again organized for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but were never activated for duty. The Culpeper Minutemen were again organized for World War I, and joined the 116th Infantry. The new A Company, (Now Alpha Company Detachment, 2nd Regiment) Virginia Defense Force, has located to Warrenton, Virginia and traces part of its ancestry to the historic Culpeper Minutemen. A Company itself is located in Fairfax Virginia.

History McKeel attended the University of Florida, where he graduated in 1997 with a degree in political science. He studied British politics abroad in the United Kingdom at the Florida State University London Study Centre. In 2000, McKeel was elected to the Lakeland City Commission, where he served until December 2005. Florida House of Representatives In 2006, incumbent State Representative Dennis A. Ross opted to run for re-election in the 64th District rather than the 63rd, where he had previously been elected, creating an open seat. McKeel opted to run in the 63rd District, which included much of western Polk County and southeastern Hillsborough County and won the Republican primary unopposed. In the general election, he campaigned on \\"small business regulation and education\\" and faced massage therapist James Davis, the Democratic nominee, who shared a name with the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor, Jim Davis; McKeel took the name association seriously, noting that he was \\"nervous about what his opponent's name might mean on a night when Democrats were doing well across the country.\\" However, he was ultimately successful over Davis, winning with over 60% of the vote. In both 2008 and 2010, McKeel was elected unopposed. Following the reconfiguration of legislative districts in 2012, McKeel was drawn into the 40th District, which was based entirely in Polk County and included most of metropolitan Lakeland. He won the nomination of his party unopposed and advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by independent candidate Lillian Lima. His opponent largely campaigned on replacing most politicians with fresher faces, while McKeel defended his record, noting, \\"I ran my first campaign on my vision for my hometown and a deeply rooted belief in limited government and fiscal conservatism. That record is very public, and I am proud of it.\\" Ultimately, McKeel turned away Lima's challenge, winning election to his final term in the legislature with 64% of the vote. When Chief Financial Officer of Florida Jeff Atwater was under consideration to be President of the Florida Atlantic University in 2014, when he was running for re-election, McKeel was considered a possible candidate to replace Atwater on the ballot as the Republican nominee. Ultimately, however, Atwater was not selected and instead successfully ran for re-election.

Access to the reserve is prohibited in winter, but the birds may be viewed from hides in Meerend Thicket. The Thicket is a steep wooded bank and indicates the former much higher boundary of the Severn. In addition, some parts of the Ham are of special botanical interest.Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al, 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' Meerend Thicket is listed in the ‚ÄòTewkesbury Borough Local Plan to 2011‚Äô, adopted March 2006, Appendix 3 'Nature Conservation',' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).Tewkesbury Borough Local Plan to 2011, adopted March 2006, Appendix 3 'Nature Conservation', Key Wildlife Sites This part of the Vale, which is aluvium over Lower Lias clay, has been greatly affected by drainage and other agricultural improvements. A public enquiry resulted in the exclusion of the reserve from the Internal Drainage Board scheme. Species Fuller information may be found in the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. The wintering wildfowl include wigeon (est. 4000), teal (est. 1500) and mallard (est. 1000) in large numbers. Smaller numbers can be seen of pintail and shoveler. Tufted duck, pochard, goldeneye and great crested and little grebe are amongst the diving birds at peak floods. Regular visitors are Bewick's swan and white- fronted geese. There is a small breeding population of mallard, lapwing, common snipe, curlew and redshank. Other breeding species including redstart, grasshopper warbler, sedge warbler, yellow wagtail and reed bunting. The meadows are also used as a feeding ground by many migrants. Snipe are the most common, but whimbrel, green sandpiper, greenshank and ruff may be seen. In some winters up to 4000 fieldfare are present and peregrine falcon and hobby may be seen, these birds being attracted by the small birds. The reserve flora includes common meadow-rue and great burnet which is typical of old, unimproved neutral meadows. There are a large number of plant types recorded in the wooded bank, fields, and ditches. There is golden dock, trifid bur- marigold, purple loosestrife and several species of sedge. Conservation The prime aim is to maintain a good wetland habitat for birds and plants. Thus the control of water levels is essential and two sluices were installed in 1977/78 and a wader scrape was excavated. Grazing does not happen until the young birds have fledged. There is regular polarding of boundary willows. Any polluted silt is cleared.

A right-handed pitcher, he attended the University of Michigan and later played professional baseball for four years from 1968 to 1971, including stints in Major League Baseball with the Minnesota Twins (1969‚Äì1970) and Detroit Tigers (1971). He compiled a 10-5 win‚Äìloss record (.667 winning percentage) and a 3.64 earned run average (ERA) in 63 major league games. He was listed as tall and . Early years Zepp was born in Detroit, Michigan, and became a \\"superstar\\" while attending Redford High School in that city. After graduating from high school, Zepp declined the opportunity to play professional baseball and instead enrolled at the University of Michigan. While attending Michigan, Zepp reportedly \\"lost his velocity and confidence\\" as a pitcher.Patrick Harrigan, \\"The Detroit Tigers: Club and Community 1945‚Äì1995\\" (Univ. Toronto Press 1997), p. 129. He was drafted but did not sign on three occasions while attending school: by the Milwaukee Braves in the 33rd round of the 1965 Major League Baseball Draft; by the Detroit Tigers in the eighth round of the 1966 MLB Draft; and by the Boston Red Sox in the seventh round of the 1967 MLB Draft. Professional baseball Zepp graduated from the University of Michigan in the spring of 1968 with a master's degree in marketing. After receiving his degree, Zepp sought to pursue his dream of playing Major League Baseball, but most clubs were not interested in a 22-year-old rookie. Zepp noted, \\"I finally went begging for a chance to play. When I decided I was in good enough shape, I went to some of the old scouts who had seen me play. I felt I wouldn't embarrass any team that signed me and this was important. Minnesota Twins' scout Frank Franchi convinced the club to give Zepp a chance, and he was signed by the Twins as an amateur free agent. After signing with the Twins, Zepp was assigned for the remainder of the 1968 season to the Wisconsin Rapids Twins where he compiled a 4-6 record and a 3.00 earned run average (ERA) in 14 games. During the winter following the 1968 season, Zepp played in the Florida Instructional League where he worked on developing a changeup pitch and led the circuit with a 1.14 ERA. After a strong showing in spring training in 1969, Twins manager Billy Martin told Zepp he would start the season with the Twins' Triple A club in Denver. However, in a move that reportedly infuriated Martin, the club's management instead assigned Zepp to play Single-A ball with the Red Springs Twins in the Carolina League. Zepp was quickly promoted to play Double-A ball with the Charlotte Hornets in the Southern League. Between the two minor league clubs, Zepp compiled an 18-4 record in the minor leagues during the 1969 season. In August 1969, Zepp was called up by the Twins and made his major league debut on August 12, 1969. In four games for the Twins at the waning months of the 1969 season, he compiled a 6.75 ERA in 5-1/3 innings pitched. In 1970, Zepp appeared in 43 games, including 20 games as a starter, compiling a 9‚Äì4 record and a 3.22 ERA. He also ranked third in the American League having hit batsmen nine times in 1970. Zepp made two short relief appearances in the 1970 American League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles, giving up two hits and one run in one inning. Prior to the 1971 season, Zepp refused to sign a contract extension with the Twins and stated that he intended to retire from baseball unless he were traded to the Detroit Tigers, his hometown club. In March 1971, following an injury to Tigers' starter Joe Coleman, Zepp was traded by the Twins to the Tigers in exchange for Mike Adams and a player to be named later (minor league pitcher Art Clifford). At the time of the trade, Detroit manager Billy Martin said, \\"Coming here where he wants to play might make him a better pitcher. I don't know but I hope so.\\" Zepp appeared in 16 games for the 1971 Tigers. He won his first game for Detroit on May 22, 1971, a 3-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. However, Zepp's ERA rose to 5.12 while playing for Detroit, and he appeared in his last major league game on June 20, 1971. Zepp later recalled that he had suffered a \\"Tommy John injury\\", tearing a tendon and resulting in lost arm strength. Zepp decided not to undergo risky surgery and instead retired from baseball.Patrick Harrigan, \\"The Detroit Tigers: Club and Community 1945‚Äì1995\\", p. 135 Zepp concluded his professional baseball career in 1971 playing for the Toledo Mud Hens in the International League.

It is reached by the recently paved Coldwater Road from Merritt or from Exit 256 on the Coquihalla Highway. It can also be reached via gravel road from Aspen Grove or Tulameen. History Brookmere was founded as a divisional point on the Kettle Valley Railway and the Great Northern controlled VV&E; shortly after 1916 when the KVR line was extended through the Coquihalla Pass to Hope. Because the Great Northern never operated trains as planned on the line, the VV&E; facilities at Brookmere (besides the station) were never built. Burrows, R.G. 1984. Railway Mileposts of British Columbia. Volume II. The Southern Routes from the Crowsnest to the Coquihalla. It was originally named Otter Summit. The settlement and the nearby lake and creek that feeds the settlement's water supply were named after Harry Brook, a rancher that worked the surrounding land before World War I. The town had many buildings from the KVR and VV&E; era, such as a water tower, turntable, three stall roundhouse (replaced with a 4 stall one when an engine's boiler exploded in 1947), section house and a unique Great Northern designed station that was situated between the KVR and planned VV&E; yards. Unfortunately many buildings have been lost to fire, such as the roundhouse, which consisted of a turntable and several buildings for steam engines. Community The village has a few permanent residents, with the majority of the residences used as vacation or summer homes. A community water supply was built in 1998 from a small dam on Brook Creek, but the water is not potable and must be boiled to prevent waterborne illnesses such as Giardia. There is no community septic system. There is a yearly Brookmere Community Meeting in the old schoolhouse where community topics are discussed. There are no services or stores in the village. Recreation The railbed of the now defunct Kettle Valley Railway, which runs down the center of the town, is now a linear parkway and part of the Trans Canada Trail section between Hope and Princeton. The area is also popular with ATV and motorcycle enthusiasts in summer, and snowmobiles in winter. The Coldwater Rd has been used several times as a transit section for the Mountain Trials Rally, headquartered in Merritt.

Brandenburg was a Representative in the House of Representatives of the U.S. state of Florida. She moved to Florida with her family in 1957, and has lived in her legislative district since her marriage in 1970. She received her AA degree from the University of Florida in 1969, her BA from Florida Atlantic University in 1972, and her MBA from Florida Atlantic University in 1980. She lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband. Progressive policies Equality in adoption rights Florida is one of the few states in the nation that do not allow residents who identify themselves as homosexuals to adopt. Representative Brandenburg has continually pushed for equality in the Sunshine State's adoption laws and has filed legislation to allow gay residents to adopt since 2007. Entering her final term in the Florida House, Brandenburg intends to further pursue this initiative during her last two years in the legislature. Drug policy Salvia divinorum In March 2008 it was reported that Florida state Representative Mary Brandenburg and Senator Evelyn Lynn had proposed bills to make possession of Salvia divinorum a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.Gresko 2008. Salvia divinorum is a psychoactive herb which can induce strong dissociative effects. It has a long continuing tradition of use as an entheogen by indigenous Mazatec shamans, who use it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions.Vald√©s, D√≠az & Paul 1983, p. 287. Salvia's sale and possession is currently illegal in a number of other American states and some other countries. Brandenburg's House bill number was HB 1363. Lynn's Senate bill was SB340. There was also SB1612. All bills proposed including Salvia divinorum & Salvinorin A on Florida's Schedule I list of controlled substances. Brandenburg's bill was passed unanimously and became law on July 1, 2008. The bill provides an exception for medical use approved by the FDA. Opponents of prohibitive Salvia restrictions argue that such reactions are largely due to an inherent prejudice and a particular cultural bias rather than any actual balance of evidence, pointing out inconsistencies in attitudes toward other more toxic and addictive drugs such as alcohol and nicotine.[i]Nutt et al. 2007. While not objecting to some form of regulatory legal control, in particular with regard to the sale to minors or sale of enhanced high-strength extracts, most Salvia proponents otherwise argue against stricter legislation.[ii]Siebert (Legal status). Notes 1. ^ The worldwide number of alcohol-related deaths is calculated at over 2,000 people per day,Lopez 2005, Table 2. in the US the number is over 300 deaths per day.NIAAA 2001. 2. ^ Those advocating consideration of Salvia divinorum's potential for beneficial use in a modern context argue that more could be learned from Mazatec culture, where Salvia is not really associated with notions of drug taking at all and it is rather considered as a spiritual sacrament. In light of this it is argued that Salvia divinorum could be better understood more positively as an entheogen rather than pejoratively as a hallucinogen.Blosser (Mazatec Lessons).

She ran for the Florida Senate in a special election on March 1998 to replace Ken Jenne, who had resigned his seat in the Senate when Governor Lawton Chiles appointed him as Broward County Sheriff, but lost to Steven Geller, a State Representative and the Democratic nominee. Ellyn Bogdanoff ran for the Florida House of Representatives in January 2004 following the resignation of incumbent Representative Connie Mack IV, who had retired to focus on his ultimately successful campaign for Congress. She emerged victorious from a crowded field of seven candidates and was re-elected unopposed later that year. In 2006, Ellyn Bogdanoff fended off a spirited challenge from Democratic opponent Christian Chiari, in which she won with just 55% of the vote; two years later, she defeated Chiari again in a rematch by a larger margin.

Waldman (born March 21, 1958) is a Democratic politician who served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2014, representing the 95th District from 2006 to 2012, and representing the 96th District, which included Coconut Creek, Margate, and Parkland in northeastern Broward County, from 2012 to 2014. History Waldman was born in Washington, D.C. and attended the University of Connecticut for a few years before moving to Florida in 1977 transferring to the University of Florida in 1978, where he graduated with a degree in finance in 1980. Following this, he attended the Shepard Broad Law Center at Nova Southeastern University, graduating with his Juris Doctor in 1985. Waldman worked in private practice as an attorney and eventually rose to become the general counsel of Keiser University. In 1993, Waldman was elected to the Coconut Creek City Commission. In 1994, Waldman resigned his seat on the Coconut Creek City Commission and challenged incumbent State Representative John Rayson in the Democratic primary in the 90th District, which included Deerfield Beach and Pompano in northern Broward County. Waldman attacked Rayson for representing X-rated clubs and for helping them to incorporate while he simultaneously staked out a public position against them, which prompted an investigation by the Florida Ethics Commission. Despite the controversy, Waldman lost to Rayson by a wide margin, winning only 40% of the vote to Rayson's 60%. Following his defeat, Waldman endorsed Rayson and called for party unity, saying, \\"It was a tough campaign but now is the time for Democrats to unite against the Republicans in November.\\" In 1999, Waldman ran again for the City Commission in District E, running against retired police captain Stanley Cohen. He campaigned on his support for economic development and for an agreement between the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Coconut Creek. The Sun-Sentinel endorsed Waldman over Cohen, noting that he brought \\"experience and a wide grasp of issues to the commission.\\" Waldman defeated Cohen by a wide margin, winning 69% of the vote to Cohen's 31%. Waldman was re-elected without opposition in 2001, 2003, and 2005. Florida House of Representatives Following the inability of Ron Greenstein to seek re-election to the Florida House of Representatives in 2006, Waldman ran to succeed him in the 95th District, which stretched from Coconut Creek to Pompano Beach in northeastern Broward County. In the Democratic primary, he faced Amy Shapiro Rose and Chris Finnegan. During the campaign, Rose attacked Waldman for making a loan to a businessman arrested for insurance fraud and for not living in the district, while Waldman emphasized his experience in municipal government. Waldman was endorsed by the Broward Teachers Union, the Broward County Council of Professional Firefighters, and the Broward County Police Benevolent Association, while Rose was endorsed by the Broward AFL-CIO, the National Alliance of Retired Americans, and the National Organization of Women. He was also endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel which noted, \\"His community and political experience, and his ideas, are clearly superior to his competitors,\\" though they noted that his association with a convicted business partner was \\"troubling.\\" Waldman ended up narrowly defeating narrowly defeated Amy Shapiro Rose and Chris Finnegan, winning with 45% of the vote, compared to Rose's 40% and Finnegan's 15%, and was unopposed in the general election. In 2008, Waldman faced only write-in opposition and won re-election with nearly 100% of the vote. During his second term in the legislature, Waldman pushed legislation that increased the cigarette tax in response to budget shortfalls. He worked with fellow State Representative Kelly Skidmore on legislation that would have banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2009, Waldman was one of just three Democrats to join with the Republican majority to weaken the class size amendment and to give local school districts flexibility in implementing the regulations. In 2010, he faced Scott Yardley, the Republican nominee and a computer programmer. Waldman campaigned on his legislative experience and accomplishments, while Yardley argued for tort reform and greater states' rights. The Sun-Sentinel endorsed Waldman for re- election, praising him as a \\"capable lawmaker\\" whose \\"experience and knowledge of the issues\\" gave him the edge over his opponent. Waldman ended up defeating Yardley by a wide margin, winning 61% of the vote to Yardley's 39%. In 2012, following the reconfiguration of districts, Waldman was drawn into the 96th District, which closely resembled his previous district but no longer stretched out to Pompano Beach. He won the renomination of his party and the general election unopposed. His continued employment at Keiser University caused a minor controversy in 2010 when it emerged that he solicited information from state education officials \\"that was of interest to his employer,\\" used the company jet to fly to Tallahassee for his legislative duties, and sponsored legislation that would have benefitted the company, among other institutions. In 2009, he had \\"sought an ethics opinion on whether his job posed a conflict,\\" and the general counsel for the House concluded that it was \\"very unlikely\\" that Waldman's dual roles meant that he would need to abstain from voting. Florida Senate Waldman, who was unable to seek another term in the state House in 2014 due to term limits, initially filed to run for the Florida Senate in 2016 to replace State Senator Jeremy Ring, who is also term-limited, in the 29th District. However, the state's Senate districts were redrawn in 2016 following a court case alleging their unconstitutionality, and Waldman instead opted to run in the newly created 34th District, facing trial attorney Gary Farmer in the Democratic primary. He was defeated in the primary election receiving 28.3% of the vote to Farmer's 43.2%.

Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous, while the Saxon Army maintained a lesser degree of autonomy. The armies of the other German states were integrated into the Prussian Army with limited autonomy. The division was formed on November 27, 1815, as the Infantry Division of the Munich General Command (Infanterie-Division des Generalkommandos M√ºnchen.).G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabr√ºck, 1993), Bd. 1, p. 661; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deuschen Heeres (1905), p. 1242. It was called the 2nd Army Division between 1822 and 1848, again between 1851 and 1859, and again from 1869 to 1872.Wegner, p. 661; Bredow, p. 1242. It was called the 2nd Infantry Division from 1848 to 1851 (as well as during wartime) and was named the Augsburg General Command from 1859 to 1869. From April 1, 1872, until mobilization for World War I, it was the 2nd Division. In Bavarian sources, it was not generally referred to as a \\"Royal Bavarian\\" division, as this was considered self-evident, but outside Bavaria, this designation was used for it, and other Bavarian units, to distinguish them from similarly numbered Prussian units. The division was headquartered in Ingolstadt from 1815 to 1817, in Regensburg from 1817 to 1822, and in Augsburg from 1822 to 1919, except for the period 1871-1873, when it was part of the German occupation forces in France. The division was part of the I Royal Bavarian Army Corps. Combat chronicle The division fought against Prussia in the Austro- Prussian War of 1866, seeing action at Kissingen, Helmstadt and Ro√übrunn. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the division fought alongside the Prussians. It saw action in battles of Beaumont and Sedan, the 1st and 2nd battles of Orleans, the battles of Loigny-Poupry and Beaugency-Cravant, and the siege of Paris.Bredow, p. 1242. During World War I, the division served on the Western Front. It fought in the Battle of the Frontiers against French forces in the early stages, and then participated in the Race to the Sea, fighting along the Somme. It remained in the trenchlines on the Somme until October 1915, and then went into the line in Flanders and the Artois until May 1916. In May 1916, the division went into the Battle of Verdun. After Verdun, it fought in the later stages of the Battle of the Somme. In May 1917, it fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne (and by the Germans, the Double Battle on the Aisne and in the Champagne). After a period in the reserve and in the trenchlines, it resisted the late 1917 French offensive at Verdun. In 1918, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). It fought in the Second Battle of the Marne, both in the initial German offensive and the Allied counteroffensive. Thereafter, it resisted various Allied attacks until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as one of the very best German shock divisions.2\\\\.

Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters. The 2nd Bavarian Division was renamed the 2nd Bavarian Infantry Division. Its initial wartime organization (major units) was as follows:Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935) *3. bayerische Infanterie-Brigade **Kgl. Bayerisches 3.

Pionier-Bataillon Late World War I organization Divisions underwent many changes during the war, with regiments moving from division to division, and some being destroyed and rebuilt. During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). The 2nd Bavarian Infantry Division was triangularized in April 1915, sending the 3rd Bavarian Infantry Regiment to the newly formed 11th Bavarian Infantry Division.

World War II service  Following shakedown, the U.S. Coast Guard-manned tanker Narraguagas reported to ComServLant, 15 January 1945, for routing through the Panama Canal to California. Attached to ServRon 8, Pacific Fleet 13 February, she moored at San Pedro, California, until departing for Pearl Harbor on the 20th. Arriving 2 March, she got underway two weeks later on a shuttle run to Johnston Island. On 6 April she sailed for Eniwetok, where she joined ServRon 10 on the 20th. By the 25th she was en route to Ulithi, whence she proceeded to Leyte and thence Kerama Retto.  Under attack by Japanese planes  Arriving in the Ryukyus 13 June, she commenced refueling operations immediately. On 21 June, at 18:42, a surprise attack on the anchorage was staged by two Japanese planes.

End-of-war activity  Narraguagas resumed her vital refueling operations shortly thereafter, continuing them at Kerama Retto until 7 July. She then shifted to Buckner Bay, and operated in the Ryukyus until getting underway for the United States at the end of the year.  Post- war decommissioning and commercial service  Arriving at San Pedro 10 January 1946, she commenced inactivation. Decommissioned 5 March, she was struck from the Navy List 12 April 1947 and was transferred to the Maritime Commission in June 1947 for disposal. Later that year, she was sold to Creole Petroleum Corporation, in Maracaibo, Venezuela and renamed Esso Maracaibo. In 1956, she was renamed again, to Yurtia, and in 1961 to Sarita.

Saunders was born in Key West in 1954, to Jack A. Saunders, a State Representative from 1960 to 1964 who served as a United States magistrate judge from 1978 to 1981. Saunders was a National Merit Scholar in high school and later attended the University of Florida, where he was a member of Florida Blue Key, graduating with his Bachelor's degree in 1976 and Juris Doctor in 1979. In 1986, Saunders ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 120th District, facing Wilhelmina Harvey and Harry Rosenthal in the Democratic primary. Though Saunders received the most votes, he did not receive a majority, requiring a runoff between him and Harvey, the second place finisher; in the runoff, he defeated Harvey in a landslide. In the general election, he was re-elected without opposition, and was re-elected without opposition in 1988, 1990, and 1992. In 1994, Saunders ran for Secretary of State of Florida, but lost in a tight election to fellow State Representative Sandy Barringer Mortham. Saunders attempted a political comeback in 2002 by running in the Democratic primary in the 39th Senate District, but narrowly lost to former State Representative Larcenia Bullard, who later won the general election. In 2004, Saunders ran against Bullard again, and though he did better in his second try than in his first, Bullard defeated him again. In 2006, when State Representative Ken Sorensen, a Republican did not seek re-election in the 120th District, which Saunders had represented years prior, he ran to succeed him. He won the nomination of his party uncontested and defeated his general election opponent, Republican David Rice, by a solid margin to win a fifth nonconsecutive term. He was re-elected without opposition in 2008, but faced a tough fight for re-election in 2010. He faced former Key West Mayor Morgan McPherson, who emerged as the Republican nominee, and Henry Llorella, who was associated with the Tea Party movement; Saunders won re-election with 55% of the vote. Following the 2010 elections, Saunders replaced State Representative Franklin Sands as the Minority Leader in the Florida House of Representatives. Rather than seek re-election in 2012, Saunders instead made a third run for the Florida Senate from the 39th District, which was open, as Senator Larcenia Bullard could not seek re- election due to term limits. Saunders faced Bullard‚Äôs son, State Representative Dwight Bullard, former State Representative James Bush, JJ Johnson, and Sal Gutierrez in the primary. Citing the need of the Florida Keys to have representation in the Senate and Saunders‚Äôs knowledge of \\"how to balance the budget and find money for key economic development projects,\\" the Miami Herald endorsed him.http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/23/2904914/the- herald-recommends.html However, Saunders narrowly lost to Bullard, winning 30% of the vote to Bullard‚Äôs 35%, with Bush, Johnson, and Gutierrez behind him.

Its purpose in IPv6 is analogous to IPv4 private network addressing. Unique local addresses may be used freely, without centralized registration, inside a single site or organization or spanning a limited number of sites or organizations. They are routable only within the scope of such private networks, but not in the global IPv6 Internet. History In 1995, the IPv6 address block was reserved for site-local addresses, that could be used within a \\"site\\" for private IPv6 networks. However, insufficient definition of the term site led to confusion over the governing routing rules. In September 2004, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) deprecated the definition of this address range, and postulated solutions to its problems. As a result, the IETF reserved the address block in October 2005 for use in private IPv6 networks and defined the associated term unique local addresses. Definition The address block is divided into two parts, and . The block is undefined. It was proposed that the allocation authority manage it, but this has not gained acceptance in the IETF.. The block is defined for prefixes, formed by setting the forty bits of the prefix following fd to a randomly generated bit string. This results in the format for a prefix in this range. RFC 4193 offers a suggestion for generating the random identifier to obtain a minimum-quality result if the user does not have access to a good source of random numbers. Example A routing prefix in the range may be constructed by generating a random 40-bit hexadecimal string, taken for this example to be 0xe48dba82e1. The string is appended to the prefix . This forms the 48-bit routing prefix . With this prefix, subnets of size are available for the private network: to . Properties Prefixes in the range have similar characteristics as those of the IPv4 private address ranges: They are not allocated by an address registry and may be used in networks by anyone without outside involvement. They are not guaranteed to be globally unique. Reverse Domain Name System (DNS) entries (in ip6.arpa) for ULAs cannot be delegated in the global DNS. As ULAs are not meant to be routed outside their administrative domain (site or organization), administrators of interconnecting networks normally do not need to worry about the uniqueness of ULA prefixes. However, if networks require routing ULAs between each other in the event of a merger, for example, the risk of address collision is small if the RFC 4193 selection algorithm was used. Attempts of registration and allocation SixXS attempted to maintain a voluntary registration database for ULA prefixes to reduce the risk of duplication.SIXXS voluntary database When the SixXS services were discontinued on 6 June 2017, the database became read- only. For the range , different design decisions have been proposed and submitted to the IETF, trading the non-uniqueness for the requirement that the range be managed by a central allocation authority. However, such attempts at standardizing this range have not resulted in a Request for Comments.

Her poems were usually short, simple and imbued with sentimentality, the beauty of nature and inner strength. She was also a successful lyricist, composing English words for the tango \\"Jealousy\\" and \\"The Dream of Olwen\\", and an author of several books dealing with Christianity and practical psychology. Early life Born in Catford, London, she was the second daughter of Alfred and Nell May. Her older sister was called Connie and her younger brother was always referred to as 'Boy'. In her early life Winifred attended Sunday School and was a frequent user of the local library. She and Connie enjoyed reading and poetry, and at night they would spend many hours reciting poems to each other. The family spent many happy holidays at Brighton and, later in her life, Winifred moved to the country and was inspired by the natural cycles of nature which figure in many of her poems. The May family regularly attended the music hall and their house was often filled with singing and whistling. Winifred showed an early aptitude for the piano and showed enough ability to regularly accompany local amateur singing groups. Following a period at Cusack‚Äôs College where she took a secretarial course she found employment in a patent agency. It was about this time that she started submitting poems for publication. Her first poem earned her 1 guinea and it appeared in Nash‚Äôs magazine in 1922. This was followed by other poems appearing in The Strand and Good Housekeeping. Musical career Her musical talent led to her being engaged by The Manor Mount Club in Forest Hill where she met the composer Frederick Drummond. He set the words of her \\"To Sing Awhile\\" to music which was then published by Keith Prowse. Subsequently she was offered full-time employment with the company. At 21 years of age she had more than 100 published songs to her credit, the most famous being the English words for Jacob Gade's tango \\"Jealousy\\",http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1116565 which was later recorded by a number of artists including Hutch, Gracie Fields, Vera Lynn, Richard Tauber and Billy Fury. Winifred later claimed to have written the song in fifteen minutes after having the haunting tango tune played to her over the telephone by Lawrence Wright. In 1930 she composed a song for the 4th birthday of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) which was recorded by Webster Booth. Popular poet In 1935 she asked The Daily Mirror for a regular publication of her poems. The features editor asked her to return the following day with eighteen new poems and a suggested pseudonym. This she did with the pseudonym of Patience Strong, a name she took from a book of the same name by Adeline Dutton Train Whitney. Her daily poems, in The Quiet Corner, continued throughout World War II until 1946 when her column was transferred to the Sunday Pictorial (later The Sunday Mirror) and continued for several decades. She also contributed poems to the weekly magazine Woman's Own and latterly to the quarterly magazine, This England. Her poems were also published in various anthologies and she made two records reciting her poems. Personal life Winifred May married Frederick Arnold Williams, an architect in 1931. They enjoyed a happy childless marriage until he died in 1965. Two years later she married Guy Cushing, a retired buyer for a departmental store. He died in 1979. Winifred was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1970. She died at her home in Sedlescombe, Sussex.

Mu√±oz became the Nationals' left-handed specialist after the team traded Ray King to the Milwaukee Brewers. 2008 to present Before the start of the season, it was not certain whom the Nationals would use as their left-handed specialist. Although neither was on the 40-man roster, both Mu√±oz and Ray King were invited to spring training. However, Mu√±oz was assigned to the Double-A Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League at the end of the preseason. He became a free agent at the end of the season; he did not play in 2009.

It was the seventh of the thirteen cartoons in the series to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. While the Deitch shorts were generally negatively-received by the Tom and Jerry fans, this particular short is often considered as one of the best of the thirteen cartoons. This is due to its love triangle that harkens back to the Hanna-Barbera era, as well as the background art and the calypso-flavored soundtrack. Plot While Tom is chasing Jerry around a dock with a rope, Jerry stops by a stack of passenger's luggage. He opens a bag on the top and a bowling ball rolls out of it. It rolls down the stack of luggage and hits Tom's head. Then Tom gets a bump on his head. He takes the bowling ball off his head for it to hit Jerry. Jerry is shown sticking out his tongue at him. Tom runs after Jerry, then he steps on a wooden plank, making it rise. It hits him in the face and he falls off the ship into the sea. The mouse looks underneath to see Tom sinking into the sea. Soon Tom gets up from the side of the ship and smashes him with a plate of jelly. Tom plays with the jelly using one of his fingers. But Jerry eats the jelly and then runs off. As Tom is chasing Jerry for another time, he spots a female cat and instantly falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Jerry places a box of matchsticks near his foot, takes a matchstick from it, scratches it on the box to produce fire, and lights up fire on his foot. The female cat appears to return Tom's interest, so Tom sneaks aboard the ship when the female cat and her owner have just boarded it. But the captain throws him off the ship. He ends up hitting a post and landing on a pier. Jerry splashes a cup of water on his face to wake him up. Next, he follows Tom onto the ship and proceeds to interfere with Tom's subsequent flirtations. Later, during the cruise, Tom gets a tray of cakes and feeds the female cat with it. Seeing Tom acting as if he is having a sweet date with her, Jerry kicks one of the back feet of the deckchair the female cat was sitting on and it breaks. The female cat falls as the deckchair falls. Tom tries to prevent the tray of refreshments from getting knocked over onto her, but it does get knocked over onto her. Seeing this, Jerry laughs. Tom lifts up the tray from the female cat's face and is shocked to see some of the refreshments being knocked over onto her. He then gets a towel to soak it in water before using it to wipe the damaged refreshment off her face. Jerry makes the cat trip over his foot and he falls near the female cat. He manages to wipe the damaged refreshment off her face but not the cream from the refreshments. So he also wipes the cream off her face. Thinking that Tom was the one who kicked the deckchair she was sitting on and made it fall, she hurls the tray onto Tom's head. The tray becomes bell shaped when it lands on Tom's head. Seeing a vase with flowers inside, Tom decides to impress the female cat by letting her smell the flowers. Then Jerry puts the flowers into the spout of a fire hose. Not noticing that the flowers were put into the spout by Jerry, Tom carries the hose which contains the flowers in its spout and proceeds to get the female cat's attention. The female cat smells the flowers. Unfortunately, Jerry turns on the fire hose when she was doing so. Water sprays onto her face and Tom is terrified to see the flowers and the female cat being boosted by the water into the air. He stretches out his hands to catch the female cat. After she emerges from a vent, Tom neatens her bow tie. She punches Tom on the nose angrily, making it hang over his chin. Then the cat fixes his nose back to normal. When the ship arrives at its destination, (a Caribbean island), Tom manages to make amends with the female cat for Jerry caused him to provoke her. A local cat, Calypso Musician cat, who is playing the steel drum spots the female cat and falls in love with her. Tom is jealous when the female cat appears to pay heed to Calypso Cat's affections. Jerry tricks Calypso Cat into making Tom feel guilty by hitting the steel drum with a stone, which causes Calypso cat to think Tom has kicked it. Obviously, Tom expresses his innocence and the two start to fight, using the drum sticks and steel drum as weapons. Tom loses the fight, and Calypso Musician cat proceeds to walk off, accompanied by the female cat. Jerry then lights Tom's feet with fire again to get his attention. Now, Tom finally realizes that Jerry was responsible for sabotaging his potential relationship, so the chase continues on the dock in a crazed fury. Afterwards, the chase proceeds onto the ship. Despite being chased by Tom, Jerry is smiling in the camera for the episode's conclusion as if it was all worth it. Production *In scoring the Tom and Jerry series, newcoming composer Steven Konichek \\"found a way forwards\\" through \\"avoiding old-style chase music\\" and \\"concentrating on atmospheric underscoring\\" in the Deitch shorts; his cues in this particular cartoon have been described as \\"dissonantly jazzy\\".

The SHARE Operating System provided new methods to manage buffers and input/output devices. Like GM-NAA I/O, it allowed execution of programs written in assembly language. SOS initially ran on the IBM 709 computer and was then ported to its transistorized successor, the IBM 7090.

Ltd. is an Australian investment company established to hold for the Liberal Party of Australia and associated entities. Named in honour of former Senate President Magnus Cormack, the company was set up in 1988 with the proceeds of $15 million from the sale of former Melbourne radio station 3XY, the broadcast licence of which had been originally licensed to Liberal Party precursor the United Australia Party. 3XY was sold in 1986 for $15.75 million. As of 2018, the Cormack Foundation is worth $70 million and has distributed over $40 million to the Liberal Party since it was founded. The Cormack Foundation is typically the largest single donor to the Liberal Party, but it has also contributed to Family First and the Liberal Democratic Party and right-wing think tanks the Centre for Independent Studies and the Institute of Public Affairs. Donations to the Liberal Democrats angered the Victorian Liberal Party as the Liberal Democrats preferenced against the Liberal Party in the 2016 Federal Election in the marginal seats of Dunkley and La Trobe and preferenced Cathy McGowan in Indi ahead of the Liberal Party.  Political contributions  The Cormack Foundation is registered as an \\"associated entity\\" of the Liberal Party with the Australian Electoral Commission. In 2014-15, it had receipts of A$5,403,207, which were marked as \\"other receipts\\",\\"Associated Entity Disclosure Return - FINANCIAL YEAR 2014-15\\", Peter Matthey, 14 October 2016. indicating that the receipts are not subject to the tax deductibility limits for political donations.  Administration  The Cormack Foundation's founding directors were Stanley Guilfoyle (husband of Senator Margaret Guilfoyle), Hugh Morgan and John Calvert-Jones each of whom held 33 shares.Crikey, 18 February 2010, Stephen Mayne: Revealed: The $58m share portfolio that can topple Brumby Morgan and Calvert-Jones signed formal Undertakings saying that they held their shares of behalf of the Liberal Party. The Undertakings also provided that in the event that the directors issued new shares any new shareholder would be asked to sign a similar undertaking to ensure that the Liberal Party kept control of Cormack. Over time, the Cormack Foundation appointed other directors, including long-standing director Charles Goode, and issued shares to them - without including the requirement to benefit the Liberal Party. Accordingly, and as the Federal Court held in 2018 the issue of the new shares resulted in the Liberal Party ownership of Cormack being diluted from 66 of 99 shares when it was incorporated in 1988 to 66 of 264 shares at present. The Directors have never explained why they did this nor have they resigned as the Liberal Party has requested they do. The Victorian Liberal Party first lost control of Cormack in 2000 when 33 shares were issued to Charles Goode making the total number of shares on issue 132 being the 66 held on trust for the Party by Morgan and Calvert-Jones and the 66 that were not then held by Guilfoyle and Goode as to 33 shares each. A problem arose in the Federal Court proceedings in that Charles Goode admitted before Justice Beach that he had a conflict of interest when he took his shares in 2000. This arose because at that time Goode was also a Trustee of the Liberal Party in Victoria but took the 33 shares in his own personal name instead of on trust for the Liberal Party branch members. Goode admitted in court he hadn't given thought to the conflict issue when he received his shares and on reflection wouldn't have taken them in his own name if confronted with the same question now. However, despite admitting the conflict of interest Goode has not resigned as Chairman of Cormack nor has he handed his shares back to the Party. Although part of the Cormack Foundation is held on trust for the Liberal Party, its shareholdings have not been disclosed in the party's financial accounts. In 2016, the Cormack Foundation made donations to non-Liberal parties (Family First and the Liberal Democrats), and froze donations to the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party because the branch had threatened legal action against Cormack. In 2015, the newly elected President Michael Kroger uncovered a theft of $1.5m by the then State Director Damien Mantach which had gone undetected for four years by the Party's Administrative Committee, State Finance Committee and auditors. Two Cormack Directors Charles Goode and John Calvert- Jones were members of the Finance Committee for the entirety of the Mantach fraud (2011 - 2014) but failed to notice the theft occurring. They later resigned from the Committee. Following their failure to notice the fraud and following Cormack's decision to give money to the Liberal Democrats at the 2016 Federal Election directors Goode and Calvert-Jones and Hugh Morgan were asked to confirm that they held their shares on trust for the Liberal Party. They refused to give such acknowledgment. Over a 30 year period the Cormack Directors diluted the Liberal Party's ownership without the approval of the Liberal Party ultimately taking ownership of these funds for themselves. In return, the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party - at the behest of its then- president Michael Kroger - sued the Cormack Foundation in November 2017, arguing that its funds belonged to the Liberal Party. Morgan and Calvert-Jones had already resigned as directors and cancelled their shares, but were still named in the proceedings. In June 2018, the Federal Court of Australia agreed with the Liberal Party's submission that Morgan and Calvert-Jones had held their shares on trust for the Liberal Party because they'd signed formal undertakings to that effect, and therefore instead of being cancelled those shares must be transferred to Liberal Party nominees. In Court, Counsel for Morgan and Calvert-Jones tried to argue his clients were not bound by the Undertakings but the court rejected their argument. However, that only accounts for 25% of the current shares in the Cormack Foundation, even though when the Foundation was created in 1988 Morgan and Calvert-Jones had held two- thirds of the shares. After the Federal Court ruling, the Cormack Foundation described the Liberal Party's victory as \\"Pyrrhic\\" while Kroger requested the Cormack Foundation's directors and shareholders to resign and relinquish their shares to the Liberal Party, threatening further legal action if they did not. The dispute between the Victorian Liberal Party and Cormack looks set to continue for many years given that the Liberal Party was found by the Federal Court to have been the original owner of 66 of 99 shares. The Party maintains it has never sold any shares or authorised its dilution whereas the Cormack Directors have never explained why they diluted the Liberal Party's ownership of the shares or why Morgan and Calvert-Jones failed to use their best endeavours to have new shareholders sign an undertaking that they hold their shares on behalf of the Victorian Liberal Party.

It comprises three buildings that exemplify the cobblestone architecture developed to a high degree in the regions of upstate New York near Lake Ontario and exported to other areas with settlers. The buildings are in the Federal and Greek Revival styles typical of their era. Later renovations gave them some touches of styles from later in the 19th century, such as Italianate and Gothic Revival; however they remain largely intact in their original designs. They are currently owned by the Cobblestone Society, which has restored and preserved them since the 1960s. Currently the largest building, a former Universalist church that is the oldest cobblestone church in North America, is used as a museum. Another building, a school, is one of only two that use the cobblestones as an outer veneer. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1993. At less than an acre in total area it is the smallest National Historic Landmark District in the state.The next largest is the Huguenot Street Historic District in New Paltz, at . Geography The district consists of three buildings ‚Äî a church, its parsonage and a former school building ‚Äî in two separate parcels totaling . Both are located along the north side of the highway just east of its junction with NY 98, three miles (4.8 km) north of Albion, the Orleans County seat, in the Town of Gaines. The terrain is generally level along Route 104, the top of the long rise of the Niagara Escarpment the former Ridge Road followed, with the land gently rising to it from both north and south. The surrounding area of the hamlet of Childs has light development, mostly residential, along the two highways near the intersection. Some of the other buildings are also of cobblestone but are not included in the district. Beyond the hamlet the area is rural, with cultivated fields and woodlots. Immediately adjacent to a modern gas station at the northeast is the first of the two parcels, containing the church and Ward House, its onetime parsonage. The school is located approximately a half-mile (1 km) down the road to the east, on the other parcel. Between the two are other buildings, mostly houses, some of cobblestone themselves. All three buildings are contributing properties to the district. History The smooth round cobblestones from the lake began to be used as a building material around 1825, in Wayne and Monroe counties to the east. The English masons who worked on the Erie Canal are believed to have pioneered the technique, borrowing from Roman building traditions still followed in Britain. Local farmers of means in the counties along the Lake Ontario shore had houses built of cobblestone in the Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles. John Proctor, a successful real estate speculator who had made money in Massachusetts and Vermont as well as elsewhere in New York, bought the Childs area in the 1820s and planned the village, subdividing it into lots. He was determined that a church should be the focal point of the village, so he bought back the current lot and had the church built there in 1834. He owned the land on which the neighboring parsonage and the District 5 School were both built, later selling them to the church and school district respectively. alt=A wall with many small round stones set in a brownish mortar, closer to white near the bottom right of the image The three buildings show the evolution of cobblestone technique. The church, the oldest, uses regular field cobbles with minimal mortar decoration. The Ward House has the stones arranged in a pattern, the depressed hexagon known as the Gaines Pattern after another small community to the west along Route 104. The school, built last, uses small lake-washed stones as a veneer. It is one of only two cobblestone buildings in the state which are known to have a cobblestone veneer over wood frame. In 1874 the church was renovated. The terrace was added outside and the inside redecorated and reconfigured so that the pews were turned around to face the new location of the pulpit in the rear, most of their doors removed, and the center gallery removed. The pews themselves, originally painted white, were grained at this time. The parsonage's original front door was replaced as well. Later the rear wing was built. Some Americans who later became significant historical personages lived in or near the future district during the 19th century. George Pullman lived there as a teenager, learning cabinetry from his father. He worshipped at the church, which remained the main Universalist church in the area until he endowed a new one in the village of Albion near the county courthouse in 1894. Newspaper editor Horace Greeley's aunt and uncle, Benjamin and Mary Ann Woodburn Dwinnell, lived in the Ward House. For a while he even held the mortgage on it. The church fell into disuse for much of the 20th century, but has hosted summer \\"country\\" services twice a year since 1971. Its tower was removed in 1919. After its northwest corner was patched with brick following some settling around 1910, the school was closed in 1952 as the local school districts modernized and consolidated. In 1961 the Cobblestone Society, established the year before, bought it for $129, Two years later it acquired the church as well. In 1966 an architect working from photos of the original tower designed an exact copy as a replacement, and it was installed. The parsonage came into the society's possession in 1975, when Inez Martyn Ward, for whom it would be named, sold it to the society. Buildings 1834 Universalist Church The westernmost of the three buildings in the district, the church is a three- story Federal style building with a gabled roof, quoined at the corners and topped by a square wooden tower with corner pilasters, and wooden front pediment. The front cobblestones are more finely graded than those on the sides, with some tooling evident in the interstitial mortar. A stone terrace in front is floored in brick capped with sandstone coping. Brick also frames a marble tablet over the front door that reads: \\"Erected by the First Universalist Society A D 1834 GOD IS LOVE\\". On the inside the lobby has stairs to the gallery, with delicate square newels topped by spherical finials, on each side. At the rear of the church is a platform with a walnut pulpit and three matching Gothic Revival pulpit chairs in front of a trompe l'≈ìil painting of an alcove. Italianate detailing is evident in the pillars and balustrade of the choir loft. The woodwork has been meticulously grained by the same local painter who did the rear wall painting. Ward House Believed to have been built around 1840 as a parsonage, it is a hipped-roofed Federal style one-story building with a raised basement giving the effect of a ground floor. The main block is sided in cobblestone applied more carefully than that on the church. On the east and west sides of the ground level the field cobbles are set in the Gaines Pattern, in which each is part of a small hexagonal box. Quoins of Medina sandstone mark the corners. On the northwest the house has a small frame wing, sided in vertical tongue and groove, added later, with a porch on the west side. Its roof is supported with a Colonial Revival fluted column. The addition itself has a shed roof. An Italianate door with two original stained glass windows leads into a first floor with Federal door and window casings on long, narrow Greek Revival doors. The walls are plastered directly onto the masonry. Furniture and decor reflect the 1880s. alt=A black and white image of a building surfaced in small round stones, seen from slightly to its left. It has a pointed roof with a square cupola on top in the front. A large tree is in front of it, partially obscuring the view District 5 School A half-mile (1 km) east of the other two buildings, the District 5 School is the youngest, built in 1849. It is a one-and-a-half- story Greek Revival gabled building topped by an open belfry with louvered vents and domed roof at the south (front) end. Its predominately lake-washed brown cobblestones are different from the other two buildings in that they are a decorative veneer on a wood frame structure. Only one other cobblestone building in New York, another residence in Gaines, is known to use cobblestone this way. At the northwest corner some brick was used when repairs were necessary. The cobblestones are arranged tightly, four rows per corner quoin on the front and sides and three in the rear. A sandstone water table runs around the building at floor level, above the fieldstone foundation. At the roofline is a wide wooden molded frieze with returns. The windows have plain stone trim. In the front center are two separate doors, for boys and girls, similarly treated, with small stone steps. Above them is a marble tablet reading \\"School District No 5 of Gaines A D 1849 Wm. J. Babbitt Esq. gratuitously superintended the erection of the building and made the district a present of the bell\\". It is topped with an unusual attic gable-field window. Inside, the recessed-paneled wooden doors open into separate cloakrooms 10 feet (3.3 m) square. Both have horizontal tongue-and-groove wainscoting and plaster upper walls. The ceilings, like all in the school, are tongue-and- groove random-width plank. The boys' cloakroom has the cellar door, and a rope to ring the bell. In the classroom, the maple flooring is inclined so students in the northern portion, the rear, were sitting higher than those in the front. Its walls have a similar treatment to the cloakrooms. Original blackboards are still in place, supplemented by slate boards added to the side walls later. Behind the teacher's desk is a cupboard and niche for a clock. The heating system of two trapdoors to the ceiling operated by a rope remains as well. Preservation The town has no special zoning to protect the district. All three buildings are property of the Cobblestone Society, founded when 60 people met at the church in 1960 to discuss how to best preserve them. In addition to the three in the district, it also runs five other buildings in the vicinity, part of the museum complex, representing life in Childs at the time the cobblestone buildings were built. It also works to preserve cobblestone buildings elsewhere in the county. The society also operates a gift shop in the basement of the church, and gives tours. It has also made the church available for weddings. Money earned from these endeavors has helped it restore the buildings and give demonstrations of cobblestone masonry techniques.

He withdrew into himself and became lonely and shy. Throughout his adolescence he maintained a sense of insecurity, which he would hide behind an intellectual facade, accentuated by his mathematical success in grade school and by a Greek teacher in high school. In 1923 Tournier received an M.D. degree at the University of Geneva. During his student years he acted as the Swiss president of the student movement Zofingia and became a Red Cross delegate for the repatriation of Austrian and Russian prisoners of war in Vienna.Paul Tournier - Establisher of the Medicine of the person , biography of Paul Tournier by The Letter Online On 4 October 1924 he married Nelly Bouvier. The couple had two children. In 1984, ten years after the death of his first wife, he married Corinne O'Rama in Geneva. Tournier died from carcinoma at his home Le grain de bl√© (The grain of wheat) in Troinex, Switzerland. Career Through 1924 Tournier was assistant medical doctor at the Medical Polyclinic in Geneva under Prof. Bickel. In 1925 Tournier opened a private practice in Geneva and started operating as general medical practitioner. Tournier became increasingly interested in Calvinism and the Reformed faith, and was heavily involved in civic and medical groups. In 1932 he joined the Oxford Group. As a result of his interests he investigated the relationship between medicine, counseling, and spiritual values. Although he initially considered giving up medicine for counseling, he finally decided to combine the two, and in 1937 he transformed his private medical practice into a counseling practice. In 1940 he published his first book M√©decine de la Personne (trans. The Healing of Persons), which was dedicated to Frank Buchman, the founder of the Oxford Group, wherein he advocates that man is more than just body and a mind, he is also a spiritual being. This combination is what makes man a person. Therefore, it is impossible to know and treat him if one disregards his deepest reality.The Healing of Persons, by Paul Tournier (republished 1983 by Harper & Row) After the success of M√©decine de la Personne he became a prolific writer of books dealing with the subject. Although he did not have any formal training in psychiatry or theology, his writing has influenced a generation of medical and religious professionals the world over. His books would eventually be translated into 13 languages. Around 1946 he disassociated himself from the Oxford Group (now called Moral Re- Armament). He would eventually (in 1982) reconcile with the group (renamed again as Initiatives of Change).Biography of Paul Tournier, by Association Paul Tournier Psychosomatic medicine was still in its infancy, and Tournier observed that the contemporary approach to illness was purely organic and failed to consider the patient as a whole. Tournier saw the need to consider not only the physical aspects of health, but also the psychological and spiritual dimensions. He therefore invited medical colleagues from a variety of fields and a number of philosophers to reflect on this with him. This international study group called M√©decine de La Personne met for the first time in 1947,International Meetings of Medicine of the Person and has met annually ever since. According to the group: > Medicine of the Person is not just another branch of medicine. It is an > attitude towards contact, an approach to patient-care, applicable in all > areas. It puts the emphasis on awareness of patients as whole persons, with > places in their community and society. Both the organic and the > psychological approach are integral parts of Medicine of the Person, as is > consideration of the connection between state of health, life events, social > insertion and spirituality. Tournier and two other doctors established the ecumenical Group of Bossey (named after the Chateau de Bossey, near Geneva). His book, A Doctor's Casebook in the Light of the Bible, grew out of this effort. How Tournier practiced his work can be seen in A Tournier Companion. Throughout his career Tournier was known for his presence, gentle personality and sincere demeanor, and his ability to communicate across language barriers.Tribute to Paul Tournier, by Keith Miller, Bernard Harnik, Monroe Peaston, Hazel Goddard & William Sisterson As his views became more popular, he was invited to lecture overseas. He would subsequently travel extensively to promote his ideas. Tournier's world view and philosophy Two religious experiences would underlie Tournier's later work. When he was 12, he became a Christian. As he grew up he became active in the church, started writing articles about Calvinism, and argued for orthodoxy and against liberalism. His Christian experience did not, however, become totally meaningful to him until a second experience, which he called a ‚Äúface-to-face encounter with God‚Äù. This encounter transformed his life and changed everything, and gave him a vital interest in ‚Äúthat other side of life, for its inner dimension, so necessary to us.\\"Daniel D. Musick. \\"Paul Tournier's Universalism\\", abstract of Masters Thesis. (1973). This encounter caused him to radically change his medical practice. Instead of merely treating the physical disorders of his patients, he started addressing the deeper problems of the whole person. In 1937 he wrote a letter to all his patients informing them of this new orientation. Tournier describes his newfound interest in the whole person thus: > I can speak endlessly of myself, to myself or to someone else, without ever > succeeding in giving a complete and truthful picture of myself... The same > thing happens with all these people who come to see me, and take so much > trouble over their efforts to describe themselves to me with strict > accuracy; inevitably I form an image of them which derives as much from > myself as from them. If they go and see one of my colleagues he will > certainly not see them exactly as I do. And they for their part will not > show themselves to him in the same way they show themselves to me. > The reader will see now why it is that this problem of the person has for > twenty years been of such absorbing interest to me. It has a general > significance which is of vital importance for all thought and civilization: > what is man? But it also has a particular significance, which is equally > important for my own life: who am I, really, myself?Paul Tournier, The > Meaning of Persons Some have argued that Tournier believed in universal salvation, that all would eventually be saved; however, it is more accurate to state that he believed in the ultimate triumph of Good over Evil in mankind through Christ's reconciling work. In response to a letter from a graduate student writing a master's thesis on his theology, Tournier wrote: > That you say as a theologian that I am a universalist is evident, in the > sense that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners > that we all are. This is what I understand Saint Paul to say when he > mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to > all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption > entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that > the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that > this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the > universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this > Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as > Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. > This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.

He was a leading playwright during the Golden Age of Television, receiving three Emmy nominations. A novelist and screenwriter, he was best known for Days of Wine and Roses, directed by John Frankenheimer for Playhouse 90 (1958) and later a motion picture (1962) directed by Blake Edwards. Biography Miller was the son of construction engineer Rolland James Miller and touring actress Rose Jetta Smith Miller. At the age of 17, living in Palacios, Texas, he sold his first story to Wild West Weekly. That same year, he boxed professionally in Beaumont, Texas, and other Texas rings under the name Tex Frontier, usually earning $10 a fight. While attending Rice University in the late 1930s, he became a part-time reporter for the Houston Post. After graduating from Rice in 1941, he traveled to Mexico as a special feature writer but failed to send back any copy because he became interested in art and was studying sculpture at La Escuela de Artes Plasticas in Mexico City. Sick with jaundice, he returned to Texas, where he received a draft notice. He served in the Navy in the South Pacific, primarily as a gunnery officer, seeing combat first aboard the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Chester--torpedoed early in the war by a Japanese submarine. Aboard the aircraft carrier , he learned deep sea diving and adopted the name JP Miller (minus periods after the initials) after receiving orders in that format by U.S. Navy addressing machines. The Cabot returned to the United States with 13 battle stars, and a Presidential Unit Citation. Miller came back with a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. After World War II, he studied writing and acting at the Yale Drama School and then went to Houston, where he sold real estate and Coleman furnaces. Moving to New York, he sold York refrigerators and air conditioners while spending off hours at theaters, television studios and American Theater Wing classes. Television Miller's first script for television was \\"The Polecat Shakedown\\", a 30-minute drama for Man Against Crime about a man who blackmailed restaurants by injecting a foul- smelling substance into eggs. When an egg was cracked, customers fled, and the villain demanded cash to prevent future incidents. When this drama was televised, Miller immediately quit his job as a salesman to write full-time. In 1954 he had five plays produced on live television. Scripting during the early years of live television, his first notable success came February 13, 1955 with \\"The Rabbit Trap\\" on Goodyear Television Playhouse about a man who works in Long Island City at a construction firm where he is bullied by his boss. He takes his family to Vermont for a two-week vacation. TV Guide synopsized the drama: \\"While on vacation, a father and son set a rabbit trap. They are to return the next day to free the rabbit, a prospective pet for the boy. But the family is forced to return to the city after a rush call from the father's demanding boss.\\"TV Guide, February 13, 1955. Back home, the boy points out that the rabbit will die in the trap. As Miller put it, \\"The guy finally realizes that the rabbit in the trap is him, and he takes his family and goes back to Vermont.\\" Miller's teleplays were staged on Kraft Television Theatre and The Philco Television Playhouse, followed by Producers' Showcase (1955), Playwrights '56 (1956) and Playhouse 90 (1958‚Äì59). He did his LSD drama, The People Next Door, for CBS Television Playhouse (1968). However, Miller received the most acclaim for Days of Wine and Roses, which was prompted by his notion to dramatize Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (which were something of a mystery in the early 1950s). The drama was telecast October 2, 1958 on Playhouse 90. It became a movie four years later, but Miller preferred the earlier teleplay, commenting, \\"Of course, the television version was closer to my heart, because it was closer to my original image.\\" Presented live with tape inserts on CBS, the television production, starring Cliff Robertson, Piper Laurie, Charles Bickford and Malcolm Atterbury, was a powerful slice of life probe into the nature of alcoholism. In The New York Times, the day after Days of Wine and Roses was telecast, Jack Gould wrote a rave review with much praise for the writer, director and cast: > It was a brilliant and compelling work... Mr. Miller's dialogue was > especially fine, natural, vivid and understated. Miss Laurie's performance > was enough to make the flesh crawl, yet it also always elicited deep > sympathy. Her interpretation of the young wife just a shade this side of > delirium tremens--the flighty dancing around the room, her weakness of > character and moments of anxiety and her charm when she was sober--was a > superlative accomplishment. Miss Laurie is moving into the forefront of our > most gifted young actresses. Mr. Robertson achieved first-rate contrast > between the sober man fighting to hold on and the hopeless drunk whose only > courage came from the bottle. His scene in the greenhouse, where he tried to > find the bottle that he had hidden in the flower pot, was particularly > good... John Frankenheimer's direction was magnificent. His every touch > implemented the emotional suspense but he never let the proceedings get out > of hand or merely become sensational.Gould, Jack (October 3, 1958). \\"TV: > Study in Alcoholism\\". The New York Times. Miller's Days of Wine and Roses received favorable critical attention and was nominated for an Emmy in the category \\"Best Writing of a Single Dramatic Program ‚Äì One Hour or Longer.\\" Playhouse 90 producer Martin Manulis decided the material would be ideal as a motion picture, but some critics observed that the film, directed by Blake Edwards, lacked the impact of the original television production. In an article written for DVD Journal, critic D. K. Holm noted alterations from the original: > When the opportunity arose to make a film version of J. P. Miller's powerful > TV drama Days of Wine and Roses, actor Jack Lemmon suggested that the studio > hire Blake Edwards (according to Edwards, that is) rather than the Playhouse > 90 production's original director, John Frankenheimer. On the big screen, > Roses began as a Fox project, but ended up at Warner Bros. when the Fox > studio started going down the Nile with Cleopatra. With the advent of > Lemmon's participation, little remained of the founding teleplay, except for > actor Charles Bickford reprising his role. Edwards had started out in > television, too, first as a writer then after that mostly noted for the > series Peter Gunn, and when he moved into features he was associated with > comedies. Lemmon, too, had been in a long string of comedies, and it's easy > to assume that both filmmakers were using the opportunity to \\"stretch\\". > Unfortunately, Edwards, who is kind of a combination of George Stevens > (comedy director turned prestige filmmaker) and Vincente Minnelli (excitable > content with no distinctive visual style), tilted the original material > towards schmaltz, from the comically lush theme-song by Henry Mancini to the > exaggerated binge scenes. According to one Lemmon biography, the actor felt > a little bad about the fact that his friend Cliff Robertson, who had > appeared in the TV production, wasn't invited to be in the movie, but the > studio insisted on a certified star for the film... What's missing is the > calm plausibility of the original TV broadcast, revived briefly on cable TV > in the 1990s.Holm, D.K.. Days of Wine and Roses review DVD Journal. Films Miller's theatrical films include The Rabbit Trap (1959), The Young Savages (1961, with Edward Anhalt), Days of Wine and Roses (1962) and Behold a Pale Horse (1964). In 1970, Dell published The People Next Door when the movie adaptation was released that year. His TV movies include Helter Skelter (CBS, 1976), for which he won an Edgar Award. He was a member of the Writers Guild of America, West. Articles Novels In addition to poetry and short stories, Miller wrote four novels. The Race for Home (Dial, 1968) has a South Texas setting. Surviving Joy (Donald I. Fine, 1995) concerns a young boy named Dub Johnson in Depression-era Houston. His other novels are Liv (Dial, 1973) and The Skook (Warner Books, 1984), about a spelunker confronting a cave creature who may or may not be from his own imagination. In what was the first use of a hologram on a book cover, the Skook was sketched by Miller and then sculpted by Eidetic Images, Inc., an American Bank Note subsidiary. Warner Books paid $6000 for the hologram elements, part of a $50,000 publicity campaign.Von Dobeneck, Monica. \\"JP Miller: The man behind the Skook,\\" Sunday Intelligencer/Montgomery County Record, September 16, 1984. The novelization of Days of Wine and Roses is usually credited to Miller, but he did not, in fact, write it. The prose adaptation was by David Westheimer, a mainstream novelist of some note (Von Ryan's Express, among others), who was also a friend of Miller's; but he only received by-line credit on the book's first iteration, a movie tie-in edition featuring cover stills from the film. The book proved hugely popular, though, and the story had become so iconic that its publisher Bantam Books (and one supposes the authors, by mutual arrangement) took Westheimer's name off the book to move it into the \\"literature\\" category and keep it in print (which they did, for decades). Subsequent printings were branded only \\"JP Miller's Days of Wine and Roses\\" without an explicit by-line for the novel itself. This novelization was followed by another in 1970, adapting the screenplay for The People Next Door, published by Dell Books. And once again, no author is given direct attribution for the prose; the cover says, \\"JP Miller's penetrating story of teenagers on drugs and parents on trial\\"; and the title page says only that the book is \\"based on the original story [sic] by JP Miller,\\" with his name positioned to imply authorship. As the writing style is much the same, it's probably safe to assume that Westheimer (at Miller's invitation) was the novelizer here too. In 1965, Miller moved to Stockton, New Jersey, where he lived for the next 36 years. He developed a routine of writing seven days a week for four hours in the morning, playing tennis in the afternoons, relaxing with his tennis pals at the Swan Hotel in Lambertville, New Jersey, and doing research in the evenings. \\"One thing that characterized him was that he never stopped working,\\" said film producer Ingo Preminger, who was one of Miller's agents. After his first marriage to Ayers Elizabeth Fite, Miller married Juanita Marie Currie. On November 24, 1965, he married Liane Nicolaus. His children are James P. Miller, Jr. (from his first marriage); John R. and Montgomery A. (second marriage); and journalist Lia Marie, Anthony Milo and Sophie Jetta (third marriage). At the age of 81, Miller died of pneumonia at the Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, New Jersey, having completed a first draft of his World War II memoirs, A Ship Without a Shore. Revivals 200px In 2003, Rachel Wood directed the New York stage premiere of Days of Wine and Roses, an off-Broadway production by the Boomerang Theatre Company. In 2005, the Northern Irish writer Owen McCafferty relocated Days of Wine and Roses to London in the 1960s, reworking it to focus on a young couple just arrived from Belfast. That stage version had a West End premiere at the Donmar Warehouse in a Sam Mendes production directed by Peter Gill, who had previously staged McCafferty's National Theatre hit, Scenes from the Big Picture. Influence In 1994‚Äì95 Miller taught a playwriting workshop. Judi Barton, one of the students, said, \\"Without him my play, Opening Act, would never have been written.\\" Her play premiered at Philadelphia's Lantern Theater in 1999. The playwright P. J. Gibson, who became a Miller student when she was 14, has written poetry, short stories and 22 plays, including Long Time Since Yesterday.

The house was constructed between 1817 and 1834, and designed with English and American architectural features. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986 for its architecture, and the completeness of its architectural documentary record. It is one of the few surviving works of Philip Hooker, a leading 19th- century American architect. History The George Clarke who commissioned the building was the grandson of another George Clarke (1676-1760), who held several posts in the government of the colony of New York in the first half of the 18th century, including acting governor from 1736 to 1743. The ancestral home of the Clarke family was at Hyde in Cheshire in northwest England, now part of Manchester. The younger George Clarke, having inherited his grandfather's extensive fortune and lands in New York, settled in Albany in 1806. His ownership of much of the land he inherited was long disputed, though he won in the lower courts in December 1815 and his title was vindicated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1818. In 1813, Clarke married Ann Low Cary Cooper, a member of one of New York's most prominent families and the widow of James Fenimore Cooper's elder brother. In 1817 he purchased lands on Lake Otsego adjacent to his wife's estate and contracted with Hooker for a country villa. The construction project expanded over time, aided in part by Clarke's further inheritance from his father in 1824. Architecture Oblique view showing mass of building to rear The architecture reflects the building's evolution during the 14 years of its construction, with a series of wings facing a central courtyard. The first phase, the family rooms called the Stone House, is \\"Palladian in form with a central two story, hip roofed core flanked by one story wings and fronted by a porch\\". Among its details are \\"Tuscan piers on the porch, a Palladian window surmounted by an oval arch, five oval windows and simple moldings in a restrained Federal style. The walls are smooth ashlar limestone with a narrow intervening band for every third course. The interior rooms are intimate, focused around a pair of library-living rooms.\\" The second phase, larger than Stone House, contained quarters for servants and services, as well as second-floor bedrooms. Its details are plain in comparison with Stone House and the exterior in fieldstone. The third construction project, the Great House, adopted a neo-Classical style unlike the Palladian. It emphasizes right angles and avoids curved forms for doorways, windows, and moldings. It represents one of the earliest uses of Doric columns found in New York, using a form more slender than their ancient models. As in the second phase of construction, large undecorated ashlar blocks form the walls. The Great House contains two entertaining rooms, a drawing room and a dining room. They are grandly proportioned, each 34 by 26 feet and 19 feet high. The ceilings are elaborately decorated. A smaller pavilion upstairs, reached by a semi-circular staircase, serves as billiard room. Present day National Historic Landmark plaque It is located in New York within Glimmerglass State Park on Otsego Lake at the base of Mount Wellington. Also on the grounds, constructed at the same time as the mansion, is Hyde Hall Bridge, a covered bridge. The building is a New York State Historic Site known as Hyde Hall State Historic Site. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Members of the public may reserve a tour of the mansion by calling (607) 547-5098.

Gameplay  The game puts the player in control of Mamoru in an overhead shooter. Different from most shooters, the scrolling is not forced. The player is able to move about as they please, although most movements end up being up and down. The \\"curse\\" part of the title comes from a special \\"curse bomb\\" attack which uses a separate button from the standard shot. These bombs can be used both to destroy the enemies' bullets, and to \\"curse\\" them, making them more powerful but opening up chances for a higher score.

Early life Leigh grew up in the East End of London. He started out playing classical guitar at the age of 12. Graduating to the bass guitar two years later, he developed a unique, classically rooted, extremely fast and funky style. Leigh made the acquaintance of Marc Bolan's road manager who gave him free-range to use all of Marc's spare equipment, Leigh was able to play virtually anything he picked up, but quickly found an affinity with stringed instruments. Aside from mastering classical, flamenco, rock and bass guitar, Leigh taught himself to play the sitar, bouzouki, mandolin, and keyboards. Leigh started doing session work at 16 and went on to join a band called 57 Men, the first incarnation of which featured Glenn Gregory (who went on to form Heaven 17) on vocals. The rest of the band later became Wang Chung. Adam and the Ants While gigging around town, Leigh was spotted by Knox of The Vibrators and asked to audition for Adam and the Ants. He joined the band in November 1979. Shortly afterwards, Adam Ant hired former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, in the hope of gaining more widespread recognition. Instead, McLaren persuaded Gorman, guitarist Matthew Ashman and drummer David Barbarossa to leave Adam behind, and form a new group under McLaren's management. Thirteen year old Annabella Lwin joined the group as its vocalist, and the band became Bow Wow Wow. Bow Wow Wow Bow Wow Wow signed with EMI Records in July 1980. Their first single, \\"C¬∑30 C¬∑60 C¬∑90 Go!\\", for which Gorman shared songwriting credit with McLaren, Ashman and Barbarossa, holds the distinction of being the world's first-ever cassette single. It reached No. 34 on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for seven weeks, despite its lack of promotion due to lyrics that encouraged music piracy. In November 1980, Bow Wow Wow released the cassette-only mini-album Your Cassette Pet. Likewise, Gorman shared songwriting credit with McLaren, Ashman and Barbarossa on seven of Your Cassette Pet's eight tracks. As it was not available on vinyl, it was eligible only for the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 58. EMI dropped the group after their second single, \\"W.O.R.K. (N.O. Nah, No No My Daddy Don't)\\" failed to chart. After splitting with EMI, Bow Wow Wow signed with RCA Records, and released their first full-length album, See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang, Yeah. City All Over! Go Ape Crazy in October 1981. It produced their first UK top ten hit, \\"Go Wild in the Country\\", in early 1982. In May 1982, Bow Wow Wow released a four-track EP,The Last of the Mohicans, which contained a remake of the Strangeloves' 1965 hit, \\"I Want Candy\\". \\"I Want Candy\\" was Bow Wow Wow's biggest international hit, and has lived on as an eighties classic, thanks in part to an iconic music video in heavy rotation on MTV. In 1983, Bow Wow Wow released their second full-length album, When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going. The lead single, \\"Do You Wanna Hold Me?\\", reached No. 47 in the UK, but fared best on the Dutch charts, where it peaked at No. 3. The song reached No. 77 in the U.S. The group were due to embark on a world tour in support of When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going, but tensions within the group were rising, as the members were suffering from illness and exhaustion after intense US touring. After a brief hiatus, Gorman, Ashman and Barbarossa kicked Annabella out of the group, and formed Chiefs of Relief with Ashman as its lead singer. Production and recent work After a few months, Gorman and Barbarossa left Chiefs of Relief. After initially trying to form a new band with Barbarossa, doing some work with Lwin, writing new songs, and doing session work, Gorman turned to record production. In 1989, Gorman's production of Silver Bullet's \\"Twenty Seconds To Comply\\" rose to No. 11 in the UK singles chart. The Soho single \\"Hippychick,\\" which Gorman produced, went Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic, and topped both the US and UK dance charts. Gorman received a gold record for his work on the track. He joined Soho and toured the US, appearing on The Arsenio Hall Show. In the early-90s, Gorman worked with Malcolm McLaren again, for whom he co-wrote and produced the Paris album, featuring the voice of Catherine Deneuve. This jazz-influenced album sold well throughout Europe, resulting in an album of Gorman's ambient dance mixes being released. The duo proceeded to collaborate on several high-profile TV commercials and two film scores. Gorman wrote and produced micro-operettas, soundscapes, and hip-hop & soul jams for the small screen for such clients as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, MCI, Nike, Inc. and Renault. In the summer of 1997, his remix of Mr. President's \\"I Give You My Heart\\" went Top 10 in the UK dance charts for 3 weeks. Bow Wow Wow reunion Also in 1997, Gorman and Lwin reformed Bow Wow Wow and embarked on the \\"Barking Mad\\" reunion tour with guitarist Dave Calhoun and drummer Eshan Khadaroo. The tour produced the live CD Wild in the U.S.A. which also included remixes of previous Bow Wow Wow tracks. The tour sparked off a spate of label interest. This demand also prompted Leigh to move to America. Missing the dance world and playing in the live arena, in March 2000, Leigh joined SoCal organic/electronic rave band Electric Skychurch for some live dates. The band achieved notoriety playing sunrise sets at the infamous Full Moon Gatherings deep in the Mojave Desert. Gorman and Lwin recorded a new song, entitled \\"A Thousand Tears\\", for Bill Fishman's 1999 film, Desperate But Not Serious (retitled Reckless + Wild in the US). Gorman and Lwin also made cameos in this film that starred Christine Taylor and Claudia Schiffer. In 2003 Gorman and Lwin reformed Bow Wow Wow again with Los Angeles guitarist Phil Gough and Adrian Young of No Doubt on drums to play the Inland Invasion show as part of KROQ-FM's 25th Anniversary celebrations. The band has maintained a frequent small-venue concert schedule through November 2006. In June 2006 Bow Wow Wow recorded a cover of The Smiths' \\"I Started Something\\" for a proposed Smiths tribute record. The recording can be found on iTunes, and it also appears on the soundtrack of the film Blood and Chocolate, and a promo edit of the recording can be heard on Gorman's MySpace page. When he's not on the road with Bow Wow Wow, Gorman lives and works in Los Angeles producing bands (most recently Morrissey and Calahan), doing remixes (including the alternative radio remix of the Meredith Brooks/Queen Latifah duet \\"Lay Down\\") and composing music for TV and film (Wimbledon and The Tenants). With a new guitarist (Jimmy Magoon) and drummer (Dylan Thomas), Bow Wow Wow played shows in California and toured the UK during 2011-2012. In December 2012, Gorman began performing under the name \\"Bow Wow Wow\\" new singer Chloe Demetria of the band Vigilant replacing Lwin on vocals. In 2014, actor/musician Zachary Throne (Sin City Sinners) joined the band on guitar. In a 2016 Washington Times interview, Gorman indicated that he was interested in creating new Bow Wow Wow music with this lineup.

Five delinquent Girl Scouts, a million hungry rats, one secret city beneath Manhattan, and a butt-kicking girl superspy- Welcome to the world of Kiki Strike'' Told from Ananka Fishbein's point of view, these books describe the adventures of the Irregulars, a group of girls who join together to explore an underground world beneath Manhattan called \\"The Shadow City.\\" During this, they must fight against various villains and help save the city of New York numerous times. Series titles * Inside the Shadow City (2006) * The Empress's Tomb (2007) * \\"The Darkness Dwellers\\" (2013) Main characters Ananka Fishbein (pronounced un-AH-nka Fish-Bean) Ananka attends a private school called Atalanta, and lives in a small apartment nearby that is crammed with books on every subject imaginable. Although she does not believe it, she is quite intelligent and very eccentric. She has brown hair, is described as chubby in Inside the Shadow City, and thinks of herself as very unattractive. Later in the book she is given a makeover by Betty, and finally sees herself as pretty. When asked what she would like to be when she grows up, she says she would like to study Giant Squid. At the beginning of the series, she needs to be led by Kiki Strike, but by the end, she is a leader herself. Ananka is not gifted in school (although very intelligent) because she finds school to be an utter waste of time. However, she learns much more important things, such as how to survive in dangerous situations and to look at things and see them as they were in the past. Her parents do not recognise her special talents and are instead very focused on how she does in school. Her grandfather was a rat lover and invented a way to safely and effectively get rid of them, The Reverse Pied Piper (a device which the Irregulars recreate and use throughout the series). Ananka is the narrator of the series. Kiki Strike Kiki Strike is a small, albino girl who founds the Irregulars and is often considered the leader of the group. Although her platinum hair, a height of under five feet, and unhealthily pale complexion are off-putting, she is described as \\"strikingly beautiful\\" on many occasions. She's an excellent leader but sometimes can be cold and insensitive to the needs of the other irregulars. Her real name is 'Katarina Galatzina' but this was changed when she was poisoned by her jealous aunt Livia Galetzina, who wanted to take over the throne. Kiki is always determined to help everybody who needs help. She is clever and knows multiple languages and martial arts. She also is reputed to have an extensive knowledge of weaponry from her caregiver, Verushka. Kiki's cousin, Princess Sidonia, is also her nemesis, as Sidonia's mother poisoned Kiki's whole family, in an attempt to take the Pokrovian throne. Sidonia is determined to kill Kiki, because if Kiki dies, she will be next in line for the Pokrovian throne. Kiki, in turn, wants to get Sidonia's pink diamond ring so that she can use the inscribed instructions to find directions to the proof that Sidonia's mother had killed her mother. Kiki has escaped to New York with her caregiver and friend Verushka Kozlova, whom she lives with. Due to the poison, unfortunately, Kiki is allergic to everything except cafe au lait and a special nutritious gruel that Veruksha prepares for her. Luz Lopez Luz Lopez is a gifted mechanic and inventor, and she is good friends with DeeDee Morlock. Although Luz is innocent, she has a criminal record which she is often worried about. She is very poor, and her family is said to have escaped from Cuba when she was a child. Because of this, Luz finds it difficult to trust other people and often lashes out when her shortcomings are pointed out. DeeDee Morlock DeeDee Morlock is an incredibly talented chemist, and she concocts every potion, poison, and perfume the irregulars use during their adventures. Her parents are both scientists at Columbia University. She is very clumsy and very kind. She is the daughter of a chemistry professor. She gets in a bad accident during one of the Irregulars' adventures in The Shadow City. She is first introduced at a Girl Scouts meeting, where she has just \\"succeeded in refining a particularly dangerous strain of botulism\\", which is described as a poison that can reverse wrinkles and all signs of age. She is the scientist of the group, and inventor of many clever concoctions, including several explosives; Morlock's Miracle Mixture, a self-made substance which repels poisons when digested; and Fille Fiable a concoction used to make one seem trustworthy. DeeDee wears dreadlocks that often get singed or burnt off during her experiments. She receives a scar on her forehead from an explosion that takes place in Inside the Shadow City. Betty Bent The third Irregular to be introduced, Betty Bent is a master of disguise. Her parents are costume designers for the Metropolitan Opera, and Betty always appears in prosthetics, wigs, and costumes. She rarely shows her true face, even though she attends the Girl Scouts weekly. Betty is incredibly shy, sweet and forgiving, rarely clashing with the others' strong personalities. She is very brave. She also makes the costumes, disguises, and uniforms for the group. When not in costume, Betty is described as a pretty, olive-skinned girl with a black bob haircut. Over the course of the series, she becomes good friends with Ananka Fishbien, and they go shopping together. Oona Wong The disgraced daughter of Lester Liu, the leader of the Fu Tsang gang, Oona is an expert hacker and forger. She forges birth certificates, driving licenses and illegal maps and is also known to have a talent for picking locks. She is a very elegant, Chinese, and is described as being very beautiful. She has her own nail studio, the Golden Lotus, which brings in much money. However, she makes even more, often partially illegal money from the salon because the rich clients believe that the salon girls do not understand English. This leads them to discuss important and often money-making deals and pieces of information with their friends, most of which Oona picks up and uses to help her get more money. Oona has a gruff voice that does not match her doll-like appearance, and she is known to be cruel or mean on some occasions. Iris McLeod Once an honorary member of the Irregulars, Iris has saved the lives of the main six several times. She is often picked on by Oona, as she is the youngest and smallest of the Irregulars. She is first really introduced at the age eleven, but first appears in the series a seven-year-old. Iris is first mentioned in the series in the first book, as she encounters the Irregulars as they are escaping from the Shadow City. In later books, she becomes an official member. She often assisted DeeDee during experiments and has developed a perfume that makes other people trust the wearer. Her parents travel a lot, and they once brought back a very strong smelling perfume that turns out to keep the rats of the shadow city at bay.

Barbarossa's stay with Chiefs of Relief proved short lived, however, and he was soon replaced by former Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook. Gorman was also out of the group by the time they released their second single, \\"Freedom To Rock\\" b/w \\"Dream Baby\\", in late 1985 on WEA. They released their third single, \\"Weekend\\" b/w \\"Kiss Of Life\\", in 1987. Later in the year, they released a self titled album, which contained none of these tracks, on Sire Records before breaking up. Agent Provocateur After the demise of Chiefs of Relief, Ashman spent several years away from the music industry. In 1992, he joined Kevin Mooney's Max, and appeared on the Red Dot Records release, Silence Running. After which, he briefly joined Rams, and appeared on their 1993 debut release, Wrecked on Swiss record label, Sound Service. The next stop for Ashman was Agent Provocateur, and it was while a member of this band that he died due to complications arising from diabetes on 21 November 1995. They released the album Where the Wild Things Are posthumously in 1997, featuring Ashman on guitar, bass guitar and Vox organ. Legacy Ashman was known for his iconic Gretsch White Falcon guitar and applying a spaghetti western guitar twang to Bow Wow Wow's music over Barbarossa's Burundi tribal drumming. Quite a few guitarists have listed Ashman as an influence over the years, including Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante. Previously during Adam and the Ants, Ashman used a cherry red Gibson SG with a Marshall amp - the resulting loud \\"dirty\\" guitar sound, a staple of live recordings of the early Ants as well as their second Peel Session and recordings for Decca Records, was heavily toned down for the recording of the Dirk Wears White Sox album. On the fifteenth anniversary of Ashman's death, Adam Ant topped the bill at a tribute concert for Ashman on 21 November 2010 at the Scala in London, in a show also featuring Bow Wow Wow, Chiefs of Relief and Agent Provocateur. Boorer provided guitar for Ant's set.

Under the current political system the Belarus Free Theatre has no official registration, no premises, nor any other facilities. Rehearsals and performances (always free of charge for the public) are normally held secretly in small private apartments, which, due to security and the risk of persecution, must constantly be changed. On several occasions, performances were given in street cafes and in the countryside, in the woods. Staffs members have been repeatedly harassed by the authorities for their participation in the Belarus Free Theatre activities and the stage director together with other people were sacked from their jobs at state-run theatres. History The group was established in March 2005 by human rights activists Nikolai Khalezin, playwright and journalist, and Natalia Koliada, a theatre producer and Khalezin's wife. The theatre was meant to be an artistic form of resisting the pressure and censorship of the authoritarian regime of president Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus. In May 2005 the team was joined by stage director Vladimir Shcherban, who has produced the majority of Free Theatre performances. Currently the theatre‚Äôs staff consists of ten professional actors, one professional dramatist, four managers and two technical assistants. The troupe's first production was 4.48 Psychosis, by the late British playwright Sarah Kane (1971‚Äì1999), which deals with \\"depression and suicide ‚Äì‚Äì two themes that are taboo in state-controlled Belarusian art.\\" The performance was directed by Vladimir Shcherban, and the premiere took place on May 28, 2005 in one of Minsk clubs. According to the website of the European Theatre Convention, \\"Since May 2005 the Free Theatre has produced seven performances based on thirteen plays. About 5,000 people attended performances of the Free Theatre in Belarus and more than 4,000 abroad during the first two years of existence. Free Theatre attracts other representatives of Belarusian underground culture in the variety of fields, such as independent music, art, photography, cinematography.\\" On 8 February 2006, Steven Lee Myers reported in The New York Times that \\"The theater ... performs in private apartments and in places that are not openly advertised ‚Äì‚Äì and, increasingly, abroad, where it is drawing international attention and support from prominent playwrights, including Tom Stoppard and V√°clav Havel.\\" The Free Theatre performed its original theatrical work Being Harold Pinter at the mid-April 2007 conference \\"Artist and Citizen: 50 Years of Performing Pinter, in Leeds, England, during which British playwright and 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter participated in the after-performance discussion. During the conference, there were scheduled screenings for conferees of the video of Square (Ploshcha), a documentary film about the situation in Belarus.Further information about the film and its political human rights contexts are described in \\"Freedom Day in Brussels: Screening of the movie 'Ploshcha' (Square) and the Solidarity Concert\\" . Office for a Democratic Belarus, Brussels. democraticbelarus.eu, 25 March 2007. Web. 5 September 2007. Michael Billington ‚Äî Pinter's official biographer and theatre critic of The Guardian ‚Äî wrote a laudatory account of the performance of Being Harold Pinter and the Free Theatre in his Guardian Online \\"Theatre Blog\\" on 16 April 2007, from the conference, observing that \\"A new production by the Belarus Free Theatre reinforces the global resonance of the British playwright's political works.\\" Afterward, the Free Theatre went on to the European Theatre Convention (ETC) in Thessaloniki, Greece, site of the 11th Europe Theatre Prize conference (26‚Äì29 April 2007), and, the ETC invited the Free Theatre to join it, waiving membership fees: \\"In April 2007, Belarus Free Theatre became a full member of the European Theatre Convention,\\" according to the ETC website, and in May 2007 \\"a member of [the] international network Trans European Halls.\\"Michael Batiukov, \\"Belarus 'Free Theatre' Is Under Attack by Militia in Minsk, Belarus\\" .

Fewer than three weeks after meeting with former Czech President V√°clav Havel on 4 August 2007, at his country cottage in the Czech Republic on 22 August 2007, during the Free Theatre's premi√®re of Edward Bond's theatrical piece Eleven Vests, \\"special forces from the Belarusian police stormed the performance by the Belarus 'Free Theatre' in a private apartment in Minsk,\\" and \\"Actors, directors, and audience members,\\" including its director Khalezin, \\"were arrested\\"; though subsequently released, \\"the theatre's founder Nikolai Khalezin is still pretty shaken up,\\" having stated: \\"'Police used to burst into our performances with machine guns but they disappeared just as fast. A mass arrest like this is a first.'\\"Ingo Petz, \\"Arrests After the Second Act\\", originally published in S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 30 Aug. 2007. Signandsight.com, 3 Sept 2007. Web. 4 Sept. 2007. (Bold font is Petz's own emphasis throughout.) According to Petz, \\"Khalezin thinks that this is a concerted effort on the part of the police, the special forces OMON and the secret service KGB 'to exert pressure'.\\" Though Khalezin himself \\"is used to\\" such harassment in the past, he stated (as qtd. by Petz), \\"'But now it's affecting those who have never been arrested before. I'm afraid that some of them won't come back.'\\" Regardless of all the intentions of special forces to stop the premiere, the performance took place the next day in one of the private houses outside of Minsk. Police were taking video of the event from the forest. On December 19, 2010, fifty thousand people went into the streets to protest what they believed to be the rigged election of Alexander Lukashenko. More than a thousand of those were beaten and arrested, including Artistic Director Natalia Koliada, other members of the theatre, and prominent artists and poets. At the Belarus Embassy in London, dozens of leaders from the artistic community, including Ian McKellen, protested the arrests, bringing international attention. Natalia Koliada was released, while Nikolai Khalezin went into hiding, where he remains. Aims Khalezin, who is also a dramatist himself, having become \\"famous with his piece 'Ja prishel' (Here I am) which gleaned many international awards,\\" observes that \\"'All theatres in Belarus are state-owned ... The directors and creative directors are appointed by the Ministry of Culture. The performances are censored, the programs are old and musty. We want to offer an alternative, a modern theatre that discusses social problems with a degree of creative freedom.'\\" According to its website, \\"the main aim\\" of the performances of the Free Theatre is to \\"break through stereotypes of the Belarusian population that are imposed by the ideological system of Belarusian dictatorial regime.\\" \\"Belarus Free Theatre will exist as long as it is creatively alive\\", says Nikolai Khalezin. Members of the Belarus Free Theatre and other Belarusian dissidents cite V√°clav Havel and the 1989 Velvet Revolution in the former Czechoslovakia, Polish theatre, and other Eastern European protest movements of the 1960s and '70s as inspirations and models for their artistic resistance as part of the status quo in Belarus.

The dictatorship says: \\"We have no suicide, no alcoholism, no drug abuse.\\" And we say: we have to talk if we want to solve problems.'\\" Claire Bigg asks: \\"If the Free Theater has no political agenda, then what makes it so subversive in the eyes of the authorities?\\"Claire Bigg, \\"Belarus: Underground Troupe Brings Cutting-Edge Theater to Moscow\\". Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), 3 Feb. 2006. Web. 4 September 2007. In response, founder \\"Khalezin says [that] Lukashenka's authoritarian regime, which he describes as 'collective farm-like,' has failed, unlike the Soviets and the Nazis, to establish an aesthetic platform to promote its doctrines. ... The Belarusian leadership, he says, therefore feels threatened by any form of individual artistic expression that illustrates present-day dilemmas. ... Despite the pressure and obstacles, the Free Theater manages to deliver cutting-edge, effervescent performances ‚Äì‚Äì and Khalezin says the troupe is determined to fight for its right to do so until Lukashenka‚Äôs regime comes to an end. Although also observing that \\"The project is often referred to as 'political theatre',\\" Petz stresses that Khalezin himself \\"definitely does not consider his art political. He says that would be too boring and adds, 'We don't have a single classically political play in our repertoire.' For him, \\"uprightness\\" is more important than the classic political play.\\" Consequences Such \\"uprightness\\", Petz cautions, \\"comes at a price in Belarus\\", as \\"Almost all the members of the ensemble have served time behind bars.\\" Director Vladimir Scherban was \\"fired by his state employer for being involved with the 'Free Theatre,' as were other actors.\\" Andrei Kolyada, a renowned Belarusian professor and specialist in scenic speech, was fired from Belarusian Academy of Arts for his collaboration with the Belarus Free Theatre. Educational project In late 2008 thanks to the financial support of the British Embassy in Belarus the Belarus Free Theatre launched an educational project named \\"Studio Fortinbras\\", destined to young Belarusians without theatre experience. In the framework of this project Natalia Koliada and Nikolai Khalezin are themselves lecturers in marketing, management and dramaturgy. The declared aim of the studio is the \\"forming of universal creator: a person who will know how to do everything ‚Äì write, stage, perform ‚Äì and will be able to propose the realization of his artistic product in any country of the world\\".Rimma Ushkevich, ¬´Theatre in the system of \\"Realpolitik\\"¬ª, January 29, 2010 ; see also the bolg of Nikolai Khalezin: \\"Theatre laboratory Fortinbras\\" . One cannot help noticing a certain congruence of this universalistic conception of teaching with the method Study Tech applied in scientology It is specified that \\"the Belarusian \\"Free theatre\\" is only interested in education of personnel who will work exclusively inside its own collective\\".Nikolai Khalezin, ¬´Belarusian \\"Free theatre\\" is looking for talents¬ª, Charter‚Äô97, December 1, 2009 .

Common and particular\\", Charter‚Äô97, January 1, 2010 . International professionals in theatre marketing, management and dramaturgy come to Minsk with workshops. Apart from that Belarus Free Theatre holds educational workshops on contemporary theatre abroad. International support Famous playwrights like Tom Stoppard, Harold Pinter, V√°clav Havel, and Arthur Kopit have supported the Free Theatre, with \\"Pinter himself ... so enthusiastic about the collage [Being Harold Pinter] that [the Free Theatre] ... assembled from his Nobel Prize for Literature speech, plays and letters from political prisoners in Belarus, that he gave the 'Free Theater' [sic] the rights to his plays for free.\\" Stoppard, who \\"gave a course in Minsk\\" two years earlier, stated: \\"'I wish that all my plays would be performed by a theatre like this,'\\" becoming \\"one of the theatre's patrons,\\" along with former Czech President Havel, whom a couple of them visited on 4 August 2007, prior to being \\"under attack\\" by the authorities again. On 30 July 2007, before going to the Czech Republic to meet with former President Havel, \\"The group ... met Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger in Warsaw,\\" another sponsor. In 2009 Belarus Free Theatre met with Steven Spielberg in DreamWorks Headquarters in LA, USA. Not only do \\"such famous sponsors bring glamour\\" to the Free Theatre, according to Petz, but they also afford \\"protection against even more drastic repressive measures\\" from the Belarusian authorities. The theatre has also received moral support from free expression charity Index on Censorship, who have lobbied British MPs on the situation in Belarus. In late 2011, the Free Theatre conducted a highly successful crowdfunding campaign on UK-based platform Sponsume to help them continue their activity, banned in Belarus, through their London office. A number of artists, including actor Kevin Spacey supported the Free Theatre's Sponsume campaign. Dangerous Acts Starring the Unstable Elements of Belarus The Belarus Free Theatre was the subject of the 2012 documentary \\"Dangerous Acts Starring the Unstable Elements of Belarus\\".

Biography Early years Juan Boria was born in Dorado, Puerto Rico where he studied elementary school. After that, he followed studies in the nearby town of Toa Baja. During weekends, he worked as a mason and carpenter to pay for his studies. He finished his studies in Santurce in 1923. At this time, his family moved to the town of Cata√±o and he started studies in the University of Puerto Rico in R√≠o Piedras. He received his Bachelor's degree as a teacher of industrial arts, drawing, and carpentry. After several years working in several places, he started working as a teacher in 1937 at a school in San Germ√°n. From there, he was transferred to another school in Can√≥vanas. Starting his career In 1938, during a show at the school in Can√≥vanas, he heard a colleague -- Pablito Rivera -- recite the Negro poem \\"La negra curandera.\\" He liked it so much that he asked him for a copy to learn and recite at his friends meetings. After some time, his friends prompted him to participate in a program at the WKAQ radio station. The poet Fortunato Vizcarrondo, considered the most important Negro poet in the island at the time, heard him and visited him. Vizcarrondo then offered him other of his poems for him to recite at the program. In 1941, he participated in a show at Lo√≠za, where he met the most important personality in Puerto Rican show- business, Ram√≥n Rivero (known as \\"Diplo\\"), who was so impressed with Boria's performance that he made Boria part of his troupe called La Far√°ndula Bohemia, traveling the island and performing as a poet and as an actor. In 1944, Boria once more joined the famous troupe and accompanied Ram√≥n Rivero (Diplo) to the Panama Canal to entertain Puerto Rican soldiers stationed there. International fame In 1950, he traveled to Havana, Cuba under the recommendation of \\"Diplo\\" and Luis Pal√©s Matos. He planned to stay there for 15 days but was so sought after that he ended up staying two months. He followed with travels to the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Venezuela, Spain, and Portugal, as well as New York, where he headlined at the Teatro Puerto Rico, and other cities in the United States. Afterward, he alternated his artistic activities with his job as a teacher in R√≠o Piedras. In 1954, Boria debuted in television on the show Tribuna del Arte from Telemundo. He also performed in La Taberna India with \\"Diplo.\\" He followed with his debut in film in 1964 in the Mexican/Puerto Rican film Mientras Puerto Rico duerme, directed by Juli√°n Soler. He also appeared in several short films produced by the Division of Community Education. From 1965 he traveled several cultural centers, schools, and public squares in Puerto Rico reciting at events sponsored by the Puerto Rican Culture Institute. He also participated at the Cultural Olympics in 1979. Recognitions In October, 1980, the 7th Festival of Bomba y Plena celebrated in his hometown of Dorado was dedicated to him. Also, the show Nuestra Noche that same year was held in his honor. The show was celebrated in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and featured singers like Wilkins, Haciendo Punto en Otro Son, and others. In 1983, the mayor of Dorado, Alfonso L√≥pez Chaar, acquired the Juana de Arco Theater at the entrance of the town and renamed it as Juan Boria Theater. On November 1, 1984, Boria himself presented his first show at the theater. Boria retired from teaching in 1974. Afterward, he started his own shop in Cupey. Boria died May 29, 1995 in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico. Personal life Boria married Em√©rita Rodr√≠guez in 1941 with whom he had two daughters: Norma and Zayda. He also had another son: Cruz Amanda, his oldest daughter. Influences Although he identified with the works of Vizcarrondo, Pal√©s Matos and Nicol√°s Guill√©n, his repertoire included poems from: * Emilio Ballagas * F√©lix B.

It was released on October 29, 2007. The music was written by Alex Davies, with lyrics by Alex and Ed Minton. Music video The video, directed by Corin Hardy, shows the band playing in an eerie woodland, late at night, with macabre characters. Two of the characters hold a chest from which another appears, a woman with a horse head. This is then followed by a bright desert- like setting where Alex Davies (lead vocals) plays while a winged woman dances around him, with the two hunchbacked characters also present. A meal then takes place between the woman, who no longer wears the horse head, but instead a mask, and a masked man. The two hunchbacks then return and take her away. The band are then seen playing again and the video brightens while Alex plays the end melody on a grand piano. In the extended version of the video, the studio the video has been filmed in can be seen as the camera pans out. The video uses the radio edit of the song; the album includes the song in its entirety.

Hart gave up one hit in his second inning of work while also striking out Jeff Kent and Andre Ethier, for a total of three strikeouts, one hit, and no runs in his two-inning Major League debut. Despite his inexperience, manager Lou Piniella showed a willingness to use Hart as the Cubs progressed through the stretch run of a pennant race, and he appeared in several close games in September. He was impressive enough during his limited time to be chosen as one of the 11 pitchers on the team's playoff roster. Hart made 8 appearances in September's stretch playoff run.

History It was originally two individual stations serving different regions. SES-8 commenced transmissions on 25 March 1966 serving Mount Gambier and south-east South Australia. RTS-5A began on 26 November 1976 serving Loxton, Renmark and the Riverland. In the 1990s, RTS was bought by SES, but it continued to produce a local news bulletin, and identified on-air as 5A. In 1999, WIN Television acquired SES and RTS and integrated them into the WIN Television network, with the branding now matching that of the Nine Network. In December 2003, 24-hour transmission commenced. Prior to 2004, SES/RTS were the only commercial television stations broadcasting in Mount Gambier and the south east of South Australia, respectively. The stations broadcast a mixture of programs derived from the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten. However, in 2004, WIN Television introduced a sole Network Ten affiliate, WIN Ten (MGS/LRS), becoming the second commercial television station in the region. Following this, SES/RTS became sole Nine Network affiliates, only sport programs (particularly AFL matches) being acquired from the Seven Network. SES and RTS, along with GTS/BKN, switched off its analogue signal on 15 December 2010 at 9am. SES and RTS plan on started providing the multichannels GO!, GEM, 7TWO, 7mate, One and Eleven, expanding to the south east area from 11 November 2011, with other areas completed by early 2012. On 1 July 2016, WIN Seven and WIN Nine aligned with Seven Network and Nine Network, after their program supply agreement through its affiliation with Network Ten to WIN TEN. Channel Nine WIN in South Australia, like its services in other states, was primarily an affiliate of the Nine Network. However, in September 2007, WIN Television announced plans to convert the station into a sole Seven Network affiliate, due to a disagreement with the Nine Network's owner, PBL Media, over affiliation advertising revenue. As a result of the switch, alongside the local news updates, WIN SA began broadcasting Seven News and Today Tonight from SAS in Adelaide rather than Nine's, as well as Seven's national newscasts and Sunrise. On 7 August 2009, WIN recommenced broadcasting Channel Nine as a digital only service (callsign SDS in Spencer Gulf and RDS in the Riverland), would be starting on 4 October 2009. The channel is a direct feed of NWS-9 Adelaide, but with local commercials. After SES's and RTS's analogue signal was switched off, the three services were rebranded as Seven SA, WIN and Ten SA. On 1 July 2016, they rebranded as Seven SA, Nine SA, and WIN respectively, to represent a change in affiliation within the WIN Network. Programming Seven SA broadcasts programs from the Seven Network, including the Adelaide edition of Seven News and Today Tonight Adelaide while Nine SA broadcasts programs from the Nine Network, including the Adelaide edition of Nine News and A Current Affair. The station also carries the Adelaide feeds of 7TWO, 7mate, 9Go! and 9Gem. News output Up until October 2010, two separate bulletins were produced for the Mount Gambier and Riverland areas.Riverland and South East share TV news, The Murray Pioneer, 29 October 2010 Then until February 2013, WIN News produced and broadcast a regional news bulletin for the combined SES/RTS region each weekday evening. Reporters and camera crews were based within the area at newsrooms in Mount Gambier and Loxton with the bulletin latterly broadcast from NWS-9's studios in Adelaide. The last regional program was broadcast on Friday 15 February 2013 with the news service ceasing operations after the weekend, and ten staff at the Mount Gambier and Loxton newsrooms made redundant. In 2014, WIN introduced short local news updates for the two areas, produced in co-operation with The Border Watch and The Murray Pioneer. The updates, presented by Britt Ditterich, air on all three WIN services during the 6pm timeslot (during Seven News and Today Tonight for Seven SA, Family Feud and The Project for Ten SA and Nine News for Nine SA). All 3 WIN channels also carry the SA and national editions of news programs of their respective partner networks, plus state and national updates from the latter as well as The Project (Ten SA only).

Contents The book has twelve chapters arranged in three parts. Part I (Chapters 1-4) covers the Big Bang, the early development of the Universe, and how these topics relate to the Eternal Inflation Multiverse (Level II in the Tegmark hierarchy of Multiverses). Part II (Chapters 5-9) covers M-Theory and the Everett interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (Level III Multiverse). It also discusses how future technology will enable the creation of wormholes. Part III discusses the Big Freeze and how a Hyperspace wormhole (one in 11-dimensional Hyperspace rather than 3-dimensional normal space) will enable civilization and life to escape to a younger Universe. Theme In Parallel Worlds, Kaku presents many of the leading theories in physics; from Newtonian physics to Relativity to Quantum Physics to String theory and even into the newest version of string theory, called M-theory. He makes available to the reader a comprehensive description of many of the more compelling theories in physics, including many interesting predictions each theory makes, what physicists, astronomers, and cosmologists are looking for now and what technology they are using in their search. Reception Scarlett Thomas writing for The Independent calls Parallel Worlds \\"absolutely impossible to put down.\\" Mark Mortimer for Universe Today felt the book maintains a nice balance between detail and corollary while sometimes drifting to the philosophical side of things. Gerry Gilmore for The Guardian, however, mocks the notion of trying to escape the far off heat death of the universe, and Gilmore also inaccurately describes the background radiation of the Big Bang as \\"sound waves.\\" The book was a finalist for the Samuel Johnson Prize for non-fiction in the UK.

Studies on the species Aphanizomenon flos- aquae have shown that it can regulate buoyancy through light-induced changes in turgor pressure. It is also able to move by means of gliding, though the specific mechanism by which this is possible is not yet known. Ecology Overcoming phosphate limitation Aphanizomenon may become dominant in a water body partially due to their ability to induce phosphate-limitation in other phytoplankton while also increasing phosphate availability to itself through release of cylindrospermopsin. The cylindrospermopsin causes other phytoplankton to increase their alkaline phosphatase activity, increasing inorganic phosphate availability in the water to Aphanizomenon during times when phosphate becomes limiting. Nitrogen fixation Aphanizomenon is capable of producing biologically-useful nitrogen (ammonium) by the process of nitrogen fixation from atmospheric nitrogen by use of specialized cells called heterocysts. A large proportion (between 35-50%) of fixed nitrogen may be released into the surrounding water, providing an important source of biologically-available nitrogen to the ecosystem. Toxin production Aphanizomenon species may produce cyanotoxins aside from cylindrospermopsin, including anatoxin-a, saxitoxin and BMAA. Colony formation Aphanizomenon flos-aquae bloom on the Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon Aphanizomenon may form large colonies as a defense against herbivore grazing, especially Daphnia in freshwater.

Life Myron Spaulding was well known on the Sausalito waterfront in the mid and late 1900s, and exerted a strong influence on San Francisco Bay sailors during the days when boats were made of wood and built locally by expert craftsmen. An accomplished concert violinist, Myron Spaulding performed professionally for many years, including with the San Francisco Symphony. It was, however, as a sailboat designer, builder and sailor, that Spaulding left his mark on the Bay Area. Spaulding moved to San Francisco, California as a boy in 1915. He received his credential in naval architecture and boatbuilding from the Polytechnic High School in San Francisco in 1923, and designed and built his first small boat while in school. It was there that he earned an additional degree in music, playing the violin. Following graduation, Spaulding played violin in the Fox Theatre's vaudeville orchestra, for silent movie houses, for the ballet, and eventually earned a seat with the San Francisco Symphony and performed with them until 1957. At the same time, he was racing and winning several class championships in the Bird class, Stars and 6-Meters. He also participated in six TransPacific races from San Francisco to Honolulu. The highlight of his racing career was winning the 1936 TransPac as skipper of the famous Sparkman & Stephens-designed yawl Dorade. Spaulding opened a naval architecture office in San Francisco before World War II. His first significant design was the Clipper. In addition to the Clipper class, he created the Spaulding 33, which can still be seen on San Francisco Bay, as well as notable custom boats, including the yawl Suomi and the yawl Chrysopyle. During World War II, he worked at the Madden & Lewis shipyard in Sausalito building tow boats and subchasers, then spent a couple of years as a marine surveyor before leasing property near McNear's Beach in the late 1940s, where he repaired boats, continued with survey work and designed and built the Buoyant Girl. After losing his lease to make way for development, he returned to Sausalito in 1951 and bought the present waterfront site of Spaulding Boatworks at the foot of Gate Five Road.Sausalito Historical Society. Sausalito (Images of America). San Francisco: Arcadia Publishing, 2005. Myron Spaulding died in the fall of 2000 at the age of 94. Myron Spaulding's widow, Gladys, died a little more than a year and a half later and left the Spaulding Boatworks in charitable trust, with instructions for the trustees to form a non-profit corporation, named the Spaulding Wooden Boat Center (SWBC). Today, the SWBC is a working and living museum, with the mission to restore and return to active use significant, historic wooden sailing vessels; preserve and enhance its working boatyard; create a place where people can gather to use, enjoy, and learn about wooden boats; and educate others about wooden boat building skills, traditions and values.Spaulding Wooden Boat Center.

In some genera (e.g. Paleoceras), the septa are uniformly spaced. Shells of ellesmerocerids are typically smooth and compressed and vary in form. They may be breviconic (short) or longiconic (elongate), straight (orthoconic) or curved (cyrtoconic). Cyrtoconic forms are usually endogastric, with longitudinally convex ventral margins. The apeces of straight forms typically have an endogastric curvature. Some may have grown to as much as 15 cm. Siphuncle segments are tubular or concave. Septal necks are short. Connecting rings which may appear layered are thick and typically wedge shaped with their maximum width at or near where they join the previous septum. The siphuncle interior is commonly crossed by irregular partitions, known as diaphragms, but are otherwise free of internal deposits As soft parts are not prone to fossilization, little can be surmised as to their soft part anatomy. Preserved muscle attachment scars indicate that they may have had segmented muscles reminiscent of primitive monoplacophoran molluscs. As for arms or tentacles, little can be said except that eight or ten, retained in modern coleoids, seems to be the primitive or ancestral number. Taxonomy Rousseau Flower defined the Ellesmerocerida as containing all archaic, ancestral cephalopods and established three suborders within: the Plectronoceratina, Ellesmeroceratina, and Cyrtocerinina. Furnish and Glenister, in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part K,Furnish & Glenister. 1964, Ellesmerocerida, in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part-K (Nautiloidea; Geological Society of America and University of Kansas Press; pp K160‚ÄìK188; figs. essentially followed suit with minor differences at the family level. Mary Wade (1988)Wade 1988. Nautiloids and their descendants:cephalopod classification in 1986; in Memoir 44, New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, 1988. included the Ellesmerocerida in the superorder Plectonoceratoidea, which she defined as containing the Plectronocerida, Ellesmerocerida and two orders introduced by Chen and Teichert in 1983, the Cambrian Yanhecerida and Protactinocerida. The Plectronocerida, also Cambrian, includes forms once included in the suborder Plectronoceratina, now elevated in rank. The Ellesmerocerida have been revised to include only primitive nautiloid cephalopods with thick connecting rings and siphuncle segments that are concave in outline. Accordingly, the order includes the Ellesmeroceratidae, Protocycloceratidae, Cyclostomiceratidae, Bassleroceratidae, Eothinoceratidae, Bathmoceratidae, and Cyrtocerinidae. The Ellesmeroceratidae, Protocycloceratidae, Cyclostomiceratidae, Bassleroceratidae are found in Flower's basic Ellesmeroceratina. The Eothinoceratidae, Bathmoceratidae, and Cyrtocerinidae are combined in the Cyrtocerinina. The Schideleroceratidae, Apocrinoceratidae, Baltoceratidae and certain members of the Protocycloceratidae, all which have thin tubular or expanded siphuncles, are now excluded. The Apocrinoceratidae, once included, is now assigned to the DiscosoridaApocrinoceratidae, Pdb Evolution and phylogeny The Ellesmerocerida are derived from the Plectronocerida, having first appeared early in the Trempealeauan Stage of the Late Cambrian and quickly diversifying into four families, only one of which, the Ellesmeroceratidae, continued by means of the genera Ectenolites and Clarkoceras into the Gasconadian in the Lower Ordovician. The other three, Acaroceratidae, Huaiheceratidae, and Xiaoshanoceratidae having perished in the extinction event that occurred late in the Trempealeauan, before the end of the Cambrian. The dominant family of Ordovician Ellesmerocerida is the Ellesmeroceriatidae which are distinguished from the generally similar Protocycloceratidae by the presence of broad lateral lobes in the suture. Sutures in the Protocycloceratidae are straight and transverse. Both contain forms that are annunlate (transversally ribbed) as well as smooth. Other Ordovician families are the broad and beviconic Cyclostomiceratidae and exogastric Bassleroceratidae, rounding out the Ellesmeroceratina. Three families, the Bathmoceratidae, Cyrtocerinidae, and Eothinoceratidae differ from the others in that their connecting rings are greatly thickened inwardly as annular lobes. The Ellesmerocerida gave rise to the Endocerida through Pachendoceras and to the Tarphycerida and Oncocerida through Bassleroceras and is the source for the Orthocerida, Pseudorthocerida, Actinocerida, and Discosorida. The Ellesmerocerida mostly died out by the end of the early Ordovician (Arenigian), although some stragglers survived until the end of the Ordovician.

Designed by C√©sar Pelli in 1980, the plan was ultimately scrapped. Proposal As part of the downtown revitalization campaign for Indianapolis, the state solicited designs for a distinctive piece of skyline architecture in the tradition of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis or the Space Needle in Seattle. The Pelli tower was to be located in the new Indiana Landing area of Indianapolis (which later became White River State Park). The Pelli design called for an obelisk tall, with a diameter of at the base and at the peak that would \\"establish the Crossroads of America\\". As such, the design would have been taller than the Arch, the Washington Monument, and the Statue of Liberty. The proposed $25 million included the rerouting of West Washington Street to the south so that the tower could be placed on the east bank of the White River where the street had crossed the river. Failure The design was met with little local support. Some residents feared it too closely resembled a corncob, which would further the stereotype of Indiana as wholly rural. Others believed the bold nature of the design would overshadow the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, which had been the historic focal point of the city's design. The park took shape and thrived without its vertical landmark. However, following the success of the rest of the revitalization campaign, there have been renewed calls for construction of the tower. Pelli himself remained fond of the design, insisting that if the opportunity to make the project a reality materialized, he would have done it.

Biography Anu was the granddaughter of Ochirtu Secen Khan of Khoshuud (or his youngest daughter according to some written historical sources), who was the nephew and adopted son of G√ºshi Khan. She wed prince Sengge, son of Erdeni Batur, regarded as the founder of the Dzungar Khanate. After Sengge's assassination by his half-brothers Tseten and Tsobda Batur in 1670, Anu married Sengge's successor, his brother Galdan Boshughtu Khan (1644-1697), who had spent ten years in Tibet as a Buddhist monk. With troops provided by Ochirtu, Galdan avenged his brother's death and assumed the Dzungar Khanate throne. Anu's marriage to Galdan Boshughtu produced one son, prince Sevdenbaljir, and two daughters, princesses Yunchihai and Boum. Galdan relied on Anu for counsel throughout his reign as he expanded Dzungar Mongol rule from the west end of the Great Wall of China to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present- day northern Kyrgyzstan to southern Siberia. Fearing the rise of a new Mongol empire, the Qing dynasty sent three armies west towards Mongolia in 1696. The Qing Kangxi Emperor personally led the expeditionary forces. Galdan moved his army south from the Khentii Mountains to meet the Qing army's western column at the Battle of Jao Modo in May 1696, but his troops were soon surrounded by the superior Qing forces.Kychanov EI \\" Lords of Asia\\", Moscow: Publishing House of the \\" Eastern Literature \\", RAN, 2004 . .

He commanded units of infantry in the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, and in the 1920s was elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Early life and career Rosenthal was born in Berrima, New South Wales to a Danish-born school master and Swedish-born mother. He trained as an architect and was elected associate of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects in 1895. He became a draughtsman in the architectural division of the Department of Railways and Public Works in Perth. After becoming bankrupt and ill he returned to the eastern states in 1899. In 1906 he was made architect for the Anglican Diocese of Grafton and Armidale. He designed St Andrew's, Lismore, New South Wales, St Laurence's, Barraba, and Holy Trinity, Dulwich Hill, Sydney. First World War In 1892 Rosenthal joined the Geelong Battery of the Victorian Militia Garrison Artillery as a gunner, but left the service three years later on moving to Melbourne. In 1903 he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Militia Garrison Artillery. He transferred to the Australian Field Artillery in 1908 where he was promoted as major. In 1914 he became commanding officer of the 5th Field Artillery Brigade. Thus before the war he was established as a soldier as well as a professional architect. Rosenthal joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in August 1914 and sailed with the first convoy as lieutenant-colonel commanding the Australian 3rd Field Artillery Brigade. Rosenthal was at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1915. He was twice wounded at Gallipoli, the second wound causing him to be evacuated to England in August 1915. He returned to Egypt when the (AIF) was expanding and given command of the artillery of the new 4th Division and was promoted brigadier general in February 1916. He was engaged in the heavy fighting on the Somme, at Pozi√®res and Mouquet Farm and at Ypres in Belgium. He was wounded a third time in December 1916. On 22 May 1918 Rosenthal was appointed to command the 2nd Division and promoted major general. He took part in the attack at Hamel. He was wounded for a fourth time in 1918 by a sniper when on daylight reconnaissance. He returned to duty in August and was involved in the Battle of Mont St. Quentin. Rosenthal went to England in March 1919 to command all the depots of the AIF during the repatriation of the troops. He returned to Australia in January 1920. Post-war career After the war Rosenthal contemplated not returning to the profession of architecture but did so while leading an active public life. From 1921‚Äì26 and also 1932‚Äì37 he was commander of the 2nd Division. He served as an alderman of Sydney Municipal Council in 1921‚Äì24 and was chairman of its works committee. He was also a Nationalist Party of Australia member for Bathurst in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1922‚Äì25 and a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1936‚Äì37. He was twice president of the Institute of Architects of New South Wales in 1926‚Äì30 and was also president of the federal council of the Australian Institutes of Architects in 1925‚Äì28. He also served as president of the Australian Museum, Sydney. In 1930, during the Great Depression in Australia, he was again declared bankrupt. In 1937 Rosenthal accepted the post of administrator of Norfolk Island, which he governed throughout the Second World War until 1945. Among other activities he raised a volunteer infantry unit. In popular culture Rosenthal may have been a part-model for the authoritarian veterans' leader Benjamin Cooley in D. H. Lawrence's novel, Kangaroo (London, 1923). Rosenthal had been founding secretary in 1921 and later president of The King and Empire Alliance, with which Robert Darroch asserts D.H. Lawrence had been in contact, probably through W. J. R. Scott. It has also been alleged that Rosenthal was involved with the Old Guard, a secret anti-communist militia, set up by the Bruce government.

NASA administrator, James Webb, jump-started the program by recommending artists to become involved in the agency. Artists, including Norman Rockwell, Robert Rauschenberg, and Andy Warhol were commissioned to record the history of space exploration through the eyes of artists. The first director of the Art Program was James Dean (NASA). Using artists of different mediums and genres serves the purpose of educating different audiences about NASA and space exploration. To give the artists the best experience possible, NASA allowed them unprecedented access to sites and materials. Participants were present at suit-up, launch sites, and press releases. All works, from sketches to finished products, were given to NASA for use in museums and exhibitions. The collection now includes 2,500 works by more than 350 artists. The program still exists today but is much smaller.  How the Program Began  James Webb, an administrator from 1961 to 1968, put the program into effect. Webb wanted to use art to capture the emotions and importance of what NASA was doing. James Dean (an artist and NASA employee) became the head of the program with the help of Hereward Lester Cooke, a curator of National Galleys. To insure that the program would succeed, Cooke looked at similar programs that the air force had and decided that the program needed three things done: Use only commissioned artists, keep all of the sketches that the artists drew while they were observing, and give artists an idea of how to represent NASA, but still let them create whatever they wanted.  Major events   Project Mercury  Artists first time observing a mission was the last Mercury launch, with Gordon Cooper's Faith 7. Robert McCall, Mitchell Jamieson, Peter Hurd, John McCoy, Lamar Dodd, Paul Calle and Robert Shore were the first group of artists chosen. Each artists was paid $800 for their services as well as the freedom to create whatever they wanted. The art created during the last Mercury launch made it possible for the program to continue.  Apollo 11 Mission  In July 1969 the program had its biggest event. It captured the attention of the public so, the number of artists grew. Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston and NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida are just two of the locations artist chose to observe. Soon after the mission, the director of the National Art gallery asked Dean, to use the art created during the mission.

Each year these dogs are responsible for hundreds of detections. Detector dog teams operate nationwide and search sea and air cargo, aircraft baggage, international mail, ships, buildings and people. The Customs Detector Dog Training Centre in Canberra trains narcotic, firearms and explosives detector dog teams for Australian Customs and a range of federal, state and territory agencies including police, military and corrective services. The Centre also provides training to law enforcement agencies from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Samoa, Guam and Saipan. The Customs National Breeding and Development Centre in Melbourne supplies suitable Labrador Retrievers not only to Customs but to Australian federal, state and territory agencies, and countries including the United States of America, Indonesia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Guam, Papua New Guinea and Thailand. History In 1969, Australian Customs Service had only two detector dogs. Dogs were sourced from animal shelters, dog pounds and people with unwanted pets. From these early beginnings the program continued to grow throughout the 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1990s, the growth in the Detector Dog Program had led to difficulties in sourcing sufficient quality dogs to supply the program. The solution was the development of the Customs detector dog breeding program to produce a reliable, high quality supply of dogs. This development included research by Mr John Vanderloo, into the best dog breed to meet the requirements of Customs across a range of criteria, with the Labrador breed being selected for their focus, versatility, temperament, and strong hunt and retrieve drives. An intensive three-year study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Melbourne and the Royal Guide Dogs Associations of Australia at the Customs National Breeding and Development Centre, identified the required genetics for breeding and the best environmental influences for development of detector dogs. In early 1993 a three-year pilot-breeding program commenced using Labradors purchased from the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia and leading Labrador breeders. This breeding program is now the only source for Australian Customs detector dogs and is one of only a handful of specialized Detector Dog Breeding Programs in the world. Today, many other agencies use dogs bred by Customs. Customs bred dogs have been deployed in a variety of fields including arson detection, food detection or explosives/firearms detection. Australian Drug Detector Dogs have been provided to various nations under Regional Assistance Programs managed by AusAID (the Australian Federal Government Overseas Aid Agency). Since 1993, Australian Customs has bred more than 1,000 puppies, most of which have been successfully deployed throughout Australia and overseas as operational detector dogs.

The island inhabited by few fishermen, has shot into the larger public view as the proposed site of the major chemical hub initiated by the erstwhile Left Front alliance led West Bengal Government. The hub was earlier proposed at Nandigram. Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee led new West Bengal Government announced on 19 August 2011 that this project will be scrapped. Etymology The Bengali word char means a strip of sandy land rising out of the bed of a river or the sea above water-level. Naya means new. Geography Location Nayachar is located at . Fisheries In December 1987, then land and land reforms minister Benoy Chowdhury had ordered the island handed over to the fisheries department. The order was carried out in March 1988. Benfish, the official agency of the fisheries department, undertook its development. The island was renamed Meendwip, meaning fish island, but nothing much seems to have happened. In government files, the island is \\"uninhabited\\" although there are around 2,500 people living on the island, mostly as \\"encroachers\\". Seven years ago 13 fishery cooperatives were set up, 315 ponds were dug and many of the 400 families on the island work in these. The rest catch fish on their own, either in the river or in small ditches that fill up with small fish during high tide. The government or fisheries department never gave them any right to the land or ponds. They were only allowed to fish around. Some 200 fishermen arrive every morning on the ferry service, work in the co-operatives and leave in the evening. In 2007, the fisheries department has even ended the contracts with the cooperatives. The state Fisheries Department has demanded Rs 220 million from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) for winding up its project at Nayachar, as it has to repay a loan it had taken from Government of India for the purpose. Chemical hub Concept The Government of India introduced the concept of chemical hubs, calling them Mega-Chemical Industrial Estates (MCIES) in 2005, but a year later enlarged it and introduced the concept of Petroleum, Chemicals ad Petrochemicals Investment region (PCPIRs). A PCPIR was defined as a specifically delineated investment region with an area of around 250 km¬≤ planned for the establishment of manufacturing facilities for domestic and export led production in petroleum, chemicals. Out of this around 40 percent of the total region was expected to have the hub. It is expected Haldia- Nayachar would attract total investment of Rs. 440 billion. The proposal of the Salim Group for chemical hub was cleared in principle by the board of approvals of the Union Commerce Ministry, Government of India, in October 2006. Other places where similar chemical hubs are being set up in India are: Mangalore in Karnataka,Panipat in Haryana, and Achutapuram in Andhra Pradesh . Haldia-Nayachar complex Indian Oil Corporation, Haldia Petrochemicals and Mitsubishi Chemicals, all petrochemical companies, are operating in Haldia. However, for setting up a chemical hub there under the ambit of the Petroleum, Chemical, Petrochemical Investment Region policy of the Government of India, the West Bengal State Government would need to acquire an additional of land, in addition to the existing in Haldia, Nayachar has emerged as the most logical option for a major chemical hub as the land belongs to the state government and the area being largely uninhabited. It will neither entail land acquisition nor require population displacement. The chemical hub would be set up as a joint venture project of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation Ltd and New Kolkata International Development. Indian Oil Corporation would be the anchor investor there. The NKID comprises three companies including the Salim Group of Indonesia. Pitfalls However, Nayachar comes under the coastal regulation zone where industries are not permitted under the existing environment rules. Once the proposal clears three environmental stages, a bridge will have to be built to link the island to Haldia. The state fisheries department had sought the opinion of the Geological Survey of India regarding the island. GSI had said that the soft land, apart from being vulnerable to earthquake, cyclone and tsunami, is also \\"young\\", not more than 60 years. The State Industries Minister Nirupom Sen has said that there was no geological data after 1985 and studies would have to be carried out. He added, \\"The technology to consolidate the soil on such islands is available. They have done it on an island in Singapore.\\" The chemical hub at Nayachar has been proposed on the basis of experience and expertise in Jurong Island of Singapore.Acharya, Prasun and Mitra, Shyamal, Samudra Bandar Kachhey, Nayacharer Model Jurong, (Closer to the port, Jurong is Nayachar‚Äôs model), Ananda Bazar Patrika print edition, 6 September 2007. Geo-technical survey GSI will take at least six months to complete the detailed geological study in Nayachar after the Government of West Bengal gives a ‚Äògo-ahead‚Äô for a geo-technical survey and the two sides sign a memorandum of understanding. No site-specific study was ever carried out there, except for a routine one in 1985. Nayachar is located in a dynamic zone and it is difficult to predict what may happen to the island in future. However, Ghoramara island, close to Nayachar island has gradually reduced in size over the past few years. However, the comparison of Nayachar with Jurong is inappropriate, to say the least. Original seven islets of Jurong, off Singapore, is underlain by hard sandstones of Late Triassic Jurong Formation. It is situated in a micro-tidal sea and is not a riverine island as the Nayachar. Geologic, geomorphic and hydrodynamic setting of the two are not comparable. In spite of the different setting, the extensive geotechnical survey undertaken for Jurong is not comparable with absolute lack of similar surveys so far in Nayachar. Without an appropriate understanding of its setting it appears unwise to try to float a large project on this small riverine island. Land On 15 February, West Bengal Government handed over 54 km¬≤ of land at Nayachar to PCR Chemicals Pvt Ltd for conducting a feasibility study in order to set up chemicals hub in the region. PCR Chemicals is a 90:10 joint venture between New Kolkata International Development Pvt Ltd (NKID) and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (WBIDC). NKID is a special purpose vehicle, which has the Salim Group of Indonesia, the Universal Success Group and Unitech, as its partners. The chemicals hub is proposed to be set up under the ambit of the Petroleum, Chemicals & Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) scheme of the Central Government.

The southern tip of Cumberland Head is about east of the city's shoreline. Southeast of the city, several miles south of the bay, lies Crab Island, which also played a significant role in the 1814 Battle of Plattsburgh, and is included in the landmarked area of the bay. In September 1814, Plattsburgh came under attack by British forces from Canada seeking to gain territory for advantage in peace talks which were then ongoing. The city was occupied by British land forces on September 6, and preparations were made for a decisive sea battle for control of the lake. American ships were arrayed across the mouth of the bay between Cumberland Head and Crab Island, and won a decisive victory over the British fleet. At the same time, the British land forces were repulsed by Americans in repeated attempts to cross the Saranac River. One of the principal American land defenses was Fort Brown, which is included in landmark as a separate area.

He specialized primarily in domestic architecture, designing homes for many prominent Twin Cities families. Early life Whitney was born in Harvard, Massachusetts on April 11, 1851. The son of Benjamin F. Whitney, he was educated at the Lawrence Academy at Groton and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received a Bachelor of Science from the Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1872. Career Whitney worked in the Boston architectural office of William Ralph Emerson and Carl Fehmer for several years during the 1870s. After moving to Minneapolis in 1878, he formed an architectural partnership with James C. Plant which lasted six years. In 1885 he began to practice on his own and soon gained a reputation among the Minneapolis manufacturing and milling elite for his high-style residential designs. During his career he designed residences for Frank H. Peavey, James S. Bell, William H. Dunwoody, and others. The Saint Paul house he designed for Horace H.

He is credited with introducing the neo-Georgian style of architecture to Minneapolis with his design for the William J. Hinkle House in 1886. Within the tasteful exteriors that appealed to his upper-class patrons, Whitney's houses were full of modern innovations such as central vacuum cleaning plants, electrical refrigeration, and intercom systems. This allowed his houses to retain value after household staffing became less commonplace during the mid- twentieth century. Whitney served on the Board of Trustees of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts from 1888 to 1896. As a prominent architect of Minneapolis, he was selected to design the Minnesota Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The structure was built under the impetus of the City Beautiful movement, whose aesthetic was expressed at the exposition's \\"White City.\\" As a follower of the City Beautiful movement, Whitney was a strong proponent of city parks and ennobling urban schemes. Whitney retired from practice in 1925.C.B. Chapman, Adam L. Dorr, and Serenus Colburn, his head draftsman until 1895, are mentioned at Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota: William Channing Whitney archives website. In his office were trained younger architects such as C.B. Chapman, Adam L. Dorr, and Serenus Colburn. He was a member of the American Institute of Architects. Family and personal life Whitney married Alma C. Walker on October 6, 1881. The couple had two daughters, Marion (born August 19, 1882) and Katherine (born March 16, 1888).Pierce 1895.

Ontonagon, ex MC hull 1799, was laid down 10 May 1944 by the East Coast Ship Yard Inc., Bayonne, New Jersey; launched 30 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Riva Halpern; and commissioned 21 September 1944, Lt. Ralph S. Logan, USCGR, in command.  World War II service  Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, Ontonagon cleared Norfolk, Virginia, for the Caribbean, whence, after taking on a petroleum cargo, she continued on to the Pacific Ocean.  Pacific Ocean operations  Assigned to ServRon 8 until the spring of 1945, she assisted in the first stages of transporting and distributing gasolines to the fleet and to forward bases from the U.S. West Coast. From ServRon 8 control, supply vessels moving west passed into the operational control of ServRon 10 for dispatch to forward units. Ontonagon joined that squadron 2 April at Ulithi. Scheduled to continue on to Okinawa, she refueled ships in that anchorage as her departure date was postponed.  End-of-war activity  On 22 June she sailed for Okinawa. Arriving on the 29th, she remained in the Ryukyus, fueling ships at Kerama Retto, Hagushi, Naha and Buckner Bay through the end of the war and the end of the year. On 15 January 1946, she departed Buckner Bay for the Philippines.  Assigned to the Army as USAT Ontonagon  Arriving 6 days later, she operated in Manila and Subic Bays until decommissioned, at Manila, 27 February, and transferred to the Army Transport Service as USAT Ontonagon.  Assigned to the Navy as USNS Ontonagon (T-AOG-36) Within a week of the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, Ontonagon was reacquired by the Navy for use in MSTS. Placed in service as USNS Ontonagon (T-AOG-36) and manned by a civil service crew, she once again plied the waters of the Pacific to keep the oil life line to a combat area open. In January 1952 she began direct support to fleet units and bases in the combat zone, maintaining that support as a shuttle ship between Japan and Korea until June 1954.  Stateside and decommissioning  Returned to the west coast in September, she was placed out of service and transferred to the Maritime Administration, at Olympia, Washington, 14 December 1954. Struck from the Navy List 22 June 1955, she remained a unit of the National Defense Reserve Fleet.  Returned to service with MSTS  Ontonagon returned to Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) and was placed in service once again on 26 April 1956. Assigned to the North Pacific Ocean, she served with MSTS until inactivated for a third time at San Francisco, California, and placed in ‚Äúready status‚Äù in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California, 25 September 1956.  Final decommissioning and scrapping  On 13 November 1957, she was struck from the Navy List and transferred permanently to the Maritime Administration. She was scrapped in 1964.  Military awards and honors  Ontonagon received one battle star for service in World War II.

This service is often confused with the Army Transportation Service, created in France in 1917 to manage American Expeditionary Forces transport, renamed Transportation Corps 12 November 1918 still limited to France, becoming a general service under the Quartermaster Corps responsible for land and water transport, then briefly a name applied to a larger organization in the early days of World War II, and becoming the separate Transportation Corps effective 31 July 1942. The Army Transport Service was established when the Army's difficulty in transporting its forces was exposed in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War with formal establishment in the fall of 1898 to operate under the Quartermaster Corps. ATS operated the Army's large ships but did not operate smaller vessels of the harbor boat service (tugs, launches, small and short range supply boats), the mine planters of the Coast Artillery Corps or any vessels of the Corps of Engineers. From that time until absorbed into the United States Army Transportation Corps to operate under its Water Division the service operated the United States Army Transports. Except during World War I, when the Army's large transports were turned over to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), ATS operated the sometimes sizable fleet of Army transports. During peacetime ATS was to operate directly under the Quartermaster General through a General superintendent at home ports and in wartime, when formal ports of embarkation were to be established, ATS would come under the port commander's jurisdiction. During the interwar period ATS Atlantic was based at the New York General Depot, Army Supply Base, in Brooklyn and ATS Pacific and the transport docks were at the San Francisco General Depot, Fort Mason, California. The Army considered maintenance of a nucleus of military personnel, intimately familiar with both military requirements, port and ship operations, that could form the core of a full port of embarkation staff in wartime or other emergency as one of the reasons for maintaining ATS itself. Coordination with other Army transport functions was aided by the fact ATS was one of the four interwar divisions of the Army Transportation Service which also had divisions responsible for rail, motor and animal transport. ATS itself became the Water Division of the Transportation Corps but the Army Transport Service name continued to be applied to the large ship branch of that division. The vessels themselves were commanded by civilian merchant mariners with a civilian crew. The large troop transports had military representatives or the Quartermaster or Transportation Corps aboard that were designated as transport commanders, on larger vessels with extended staff, with authority over all embarked personnel but no authority over the ship itself. On smaller vessels or cargo ships a single officer would represent the Corps. The ships were not armed except during World War II when naval type guns were installed and manned by Naval Armed Guard gun crews. Naval personnel, either Armed Guard or communications were under their own commander independent of ship's master or Corps representatives in tactical matters. USAT Admiral H. T. Mayo: Serving as an Army transport circa 1947. The Army soon renamed her USAT General Nelson M. Walker. After World War II the Army's large transports resumed peacetime operation for a brief time until the formation of the Department of Defense resulted in consolidation under the Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service.

Known for most of its length as Gorman Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 50 (US 50) in Gorman north to MD 135 in Mountain Lake Park. MD 560 serves as the main street of Loch Lynn Heights. The state highway also provides a connection through southeastern Garrett County between US 50 on the east side of Backbone Mountain and the Oakland area. MD 560 was constructed from both ends beginning in the early 1930s. The northern segment was extended over Backbone Mountain in the late 1930s, but it was not until 1949 that the gap in MD 560 was filled. Route description View south along MD 560 at MD 135 in Mountain Lake Park MD 560 begins at an intersection with US 50 (George Washington Highway) just west of the North Branch Potomac River and CSX's Thomas Subdivision in Gorman. After passing through the village and crossing Nydegger Run, the state highway heads north as two-lane undivided Gorman Road through farmland. MD 560 crosses Glade Run and meets White Church Steyer Road next to the hamlet of Kearney before turning northwest and crossing Backbone Mountain at Kelso Gap. After descending the mountain, the state highway turns west toward Loch Lynn Heights. The name of MD 560 changes to Lothian Street upon entering the town limits. At Argyle Street, MD 560 veers west onto Third Street then turns north onto Paull Street. MD 560 leaves Loch Lynn Heights by crossing CSX's Mountain Subdivision at grade and enters Mountain Lake Park, where the state highway immediately reaches its northern terminus at MD 135 (Maryland Highway). History MD 560 was constructed beginning in 1930 from both the Loch Lynn Heights and Gorman ends. By 1933, the state highway was paved from US 50 north to Le Moyne King Road, and from MD 41 (now MD 135) south to Bethlehem Road just north of Backbone Mountain. The northern section was extended over Backbone Mountain to White Church Steyer Road at Kearney by 1939.

Other Christian Science groups were meeting at the time around the United States, and the membership of the Oconto church did not realize they had built the first Christian Science church edifice in the world until later. Laura Sargent and her sister Victoria, who were very involved in the founding of the church, would go on to play important roles in the movement.Laura Ellen Sargent, C.S.D.

In humans it is encoded by the COMP gene.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a noncollagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) protein. It consists of five identical glycoprotein subunits, each with EGF-like and calcium- binding (thrombospondin-like) domains. Oligomerization results from formation of a five-stranded coiled coil and disulfide bonds. Binding to other ECM proteins such as collagen appears to depend on divalent cations. Mutations can cause the osteochondrodysplasias pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). COMP is a marker of cartilage turnover. It is present in high quantities in fibrotic scars and systemic sclerosis, and it appears to have a role in vascular wall remodeling.

The basolia was usually homemade and of very rough construction. Sometimes the soundboard was sewn to the body rather than glued. The strings are tuned in fifths. Three different types are found in Ukraine: *1) 3 string found in Boiko ethnic area. The strings are usually plucked. *2) 4 string in central Ukraine. The strings are usually played with a bow. *3) 5 string from Transcarpathia. The strings are usually hit with a stick. In Poland, the basolia has 2-4 strings, which are usually played with a bow. The basolia is used in Ukrainian folk music ensembles known as Troyista muzyky (literally Trio music). It is now rarely found, almost totally replaced by the standard cello in Ukraine, or by the accordion in Poland. The basolia was an instrument that was often ridiculed for its quality of sound and the skill of the player. All the same, wedding music without it was unthinkable. The basolia was introduced into Ukraine from the West after the fiddle had established itself, however, there are mentions which date back to the 17th century in descriptions of the wedding of Bohdan Khmelnytsky's son Yuri, where an orchestra using this instrument entertained the guests.

Known for most of its length as Bittinger Road, the state highway runs from MD 135 in Altamont north to U.S. Route 40 Alternate (US 40 Alt) in Grantsville. MD 495 passes through rural areas of central Garrett County, connecting Bittinger with the northern and southern parts of the county. The state highway also provides an alternate route to US 219 between Interstate 68 (I-68) and resorts around Deep Creek Lake. MD 495 was constructed from both ends starting in the mid-1930s. By the late 1940s, the state highway was complete except for a gap south of Bittinger; this gap was filled in the mid-1950s. The southern terminus of MD 495 was extended to Altamont in 1956. Route description View south along MD 495 in Grantsville MD 495 begins at an intersection with MD 135 (Maryland Highway) in Altamont. The state highway heads northeast as two-lane undivided Swanton Road through the valley of the North Branch of Crabtree Creek. MD 495 crosses the creek a few times before the highway enters the village of Swanton. At the intersection with Swanton Road, the state highway turns north onto Bittinger Road, crosses the creek for the last time, and leaves Swanton. MD 495 crosses Hickory Ridge and enters the watershed of Deep Creek Lake. The state highway crosses several streams that flow into the lake, including Green Glade Run and North Glade Run, and intersects several roads that serve the east side of the lake, including Glendale Road, which heads west to US 219 at Thayerville. After New Germany Road splits to the northeast toward New Germany State Park, MD 495 crosses Meadow Mountain. The state highway passes Rock Lodge Road before heading through the unincorporated village of Bittinger. Near Jennings, MD 495 descends into the valley of the South Branch of the Casselman River between the old alignment, Baker Road, and a brick factory. The state highway crosses the North Branch of the river at the community of Casselman and follows the Casselman River north, crossing Spiker Run and Shade Run. MD 495 leaves the river valley, ascending a hill and reaching a diamond interchange with I-68 (National Freeway), which is concurrent with US 40 and US 219. The state highway enters the town of Grantsville, where its name is Yoder Street, and meets its northern terminus at US 40 Alternate (Main Street). History The first section of MD 495 was constructed for between US 40 in Grantsville and Fire Clay Road in Casselman in 1933. The state highway was extended south to Jennings Road near Jennings in 1938. MD 495 was extended south in two sections-- by the Maryland State Roads Commission and as part of a Works Progress Administration project--to Rock Lodge Road in Bittinger in 1940. The first segment of highway from the south end was completed between MD 38 (now MD 135) in Altamont east to Painters School Road near Swanton by 1933. This southern segment was extended east to Swanton and north to near Upper Green Glade Road in 1935; the Altamont-Swanton segment became part of MD 135, while the section north from Swanton was designated MD 537. The southern section was extended north to North Glade Road in 1936. MD 537 was redesignated as a second section of MD 495 by 1946. The highway was extended north to Glendale Road in 1948. Three changes occurred around 1956. MD 495 was relocated between Casselman and Jennings. The gap between Glendale Road and Rock Lodge Road was closed with the completion of MD 495 over Meadow Mountain. MD 135 was moved to its present alignment atop Backbone Mountain and MD 495 was extended west from Swanton to its present southern terminus at Altamont.

Malwala Palace was located along the road leading towards east from Charminar. It was constructed in Mughal and Rajasthani style and in Hyderabadi courtyard style, was known for its richly carved. wooden pavilion. Other than Raja Bhagwandas Bagh Pavilion, Malwala Palace was the only other palace in Hyderabad having a wooden pavilion. Barring the grand gateway, the entire palace complex has been demolished in August 2000 and a shopping mall has been built in its place. History The Malwalas were responsible for the revenue records of the Nizam's dominions. The palace belonged to a noble family of Dewan Chandulal, the Malwala or the custodians of the Revenue Records (Daftar -i- Mal) of the erstwhile Hyderabad State. Built in the early 18th century by the noble Sagar Mall during the reign of first nizam in 1724, this was one of the very few palaces of Hyderabad built in the Mughal and Rajasthani styles of architecture. It acquired the name Malwala as Sagar Mall was the custodian of revenue records (maal) in hyderabad state. At the time department of revenue was held by the Mathur Kayastha family or Malwala family. During the 1940s, at the time of one of the family descendants, Raja Dharam Karan, the grandeur of the palace was resplendent and was noted for its glory and power. It was an exquisite Diwan Khana made of huge arches in lacquered wood and painted with vegetable dyes and two galleries about 80 m in length flanking the Diwan Khana on each side constructed with Rangoon teak rafters. The galleries housed priceless collection of antique Indian art and artifacts. The palace also had a library, which boasted of a collection of rare books and manuscripts from the 10th century A.D. It is one of the few wooden edifices in the city, a double-storeyed mansion with inner courtyards, with its ornamental archway entrance rich in stucco work and a fountain at the centre. There were wooden pavilions on two sides and overhanging wooden balconies with intricate patterns in Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles. The palace had two wings, the eastern part used for official business, celebrations and social functions and the western one for residential purpose. The eastern part extended to 2460 square metres with a beautiful cistern standing in the middle of the vast courtyard. It consisted of a series of galleries in two floors and a wooden pavilion, which like the Diwan-i-Khas of the Delhi Fort is \\"an oriental magnificence in wood.\\" Vegetable dyes were used for decorating the lacquered wood and the walls. Tragedy struck the Malwala Palace, a protected heritage building, having rare wooden pavilion considered the \\"bride\\" among the garland of palaces around Charminar when the major portion as important as the \\"heart\\" was reduced to rubble in 2000. The demolition occurred after disputes between a sections of the owners of the palace, some in collusion with real estate developers and politicians over maintaining heritage status of the building.

It is the sequel to the 1998 video game Carnivores and is the second in the Carnivores series. The source code became available on Assembla in 2013.carnivores_2 Around 2017 the source code was also released via Mod DB.carnivores 2/ice age source code on moddb.com Gameplay The DinoHunt Corporation continues to allow people to hunt dinosaurs on the planet FMM UV-32. After further exploration of the dinosaur planet, more islands have been opened to a growing number of customers. Gameplay is similar to the original Carnivores, with some changes. At the start of the game, the player must register a hunter or continue with a saved hunter. The point of the game is similar to the previous Carnivores game: the player must hunt dinosaurs to get trophies and accumulate credits. A new hunter is given 100 credits. The player uses credits to select a hunting area, a dinosaur to hunt and a weapon to use. Levels include a forest, a jungle and a swamp; weapons include a pistol, a shotgun, a crossbow, and a sniper rifle. Each dinosaur, area, and weapon has its own cost; the player's remaining credits determine what the player can and cannot bring on the hunt. The dinosaurs that are available to hunt, from the lowest to the highest price, are the Parasaurolophus, Ankylosaurus, Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, Chasmosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus rex. When the player chooses an item from the menu, other selections may become unavailable depending on the amount of remaining credits. Available selections are highlighted in blue, selected items are yellow and unavailable items are gray. The player can easily have several dinosaurs to hunt, with several weapons selected at the same time as he advances in his hunting skills. As the player hunts the selected dinosaurs, each successful kill will result in a number of credits added to the player's account. The player can kill more than one dinosaur per hunting expedition, allowing him to earn enough credits to move into more advanced areas with more expensive weapons and more dangerous dinosaurs. However, if the player is killed by a dinosaur, all credits accumulated on the specific hunt are forfeited. The player must be evacuated by DinoHunt and survive the hunt to keep the credits he earned. There are various methods of increasing or decreasing the credits per dinosaur. When the player kills or tranquilizes a dinosaur, he receives credits that are dependent on the type of dinosaur and on his selected equipment usage. For example, killing a dinosaur that was not selected in the menu will give only half of that dinosaur's total available credits. Tranquilizing rather than killing a dinosaur will increase the player's credits per hunt by 25 percent. Hunting accessories such as camouflage and a dinosaur-detecting radar can be used during hunting, but will deduct points if utilized. First time hunters can use the Observation Mode to familiarize themselves with dinosaur behavior and different terrain. Each dinosaur will react to a hunter differently depending on its nature. Some are more adept at detecting the player's scent, while others may see him in the distance, or hear his footsteps. Once a dinosaur takes note of the player, a number of reactions can happen. Herbivores may run away or attack the player if they feel cornered. Carnivores may attack the player head on, or gather in an organized pack to flank the player and take him out. Regardless of which dinosaur the player is hunting, there are others that do not appear on the radar that can launch a surprise attack. Harmless, ambient animals such as appear on every hunt but cannot be selected from the main hunting menu. These are the Moschops, Gallimimus, Dimetrodon, Dimorphodon, Pteranodon, and Brachiosaurus. They are worth zero points and can be killed with a single shot, excluding the Brachiosaurus, which cannot be killed. Reception According to GameRankings, Carnivores 2 has a rating of 66.5 percent. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised its \\"carefully detailed and almost disturbingly lifelike\\" dinosaurs, as well as the creatures' convincing, hypothetical noises. Bernard Dy of Daily Radar praised the game's artificial intelligence (A.I.), but criticized the \\"abundance of mundane walking and waiting while looking for dinosaurs. Some might consider this a realistic part of hunting, but it's also a realistic part of boredom. A player who doesn't use the radar to help find prey is in for some very long afternoons.\\" However, Dy noted that the game's walking was not \\"terrible\\" thanks to its \\"beautiful\\" scenery. Dy concluded, \\"The majority of gamers will still prefer a traditional title with gobs of combat, and for most of us, it's because those games will be more fun. Carnivores 2 has some quirks and boring segments, but we have to give it credit for doing well what it intended to do.\\" Marc Saltzman, writing for IGN and The Electric Playground, praised its dinosaur animation and realistic environments, but criticized the A.I. as one of the game's major weaknesses: \\"Very rarely did I feel like I was being hunted by the beasts themselves ‚Äì one of the main reasons why you'd play this game instead of another. Even while constantly running and not using any camouflage, carnivore attacks were extremely rare. I would've liked the option to hunt smarter, tougher beasts.\\" Andrew S. Bub of Gamecenter praised the improved graphics and additional features in the sequel, but criticized the A.I. and stated that the game could have been better. Bub also wrote that it takes too long to gain the ability to hunt larger dinosaurs such as the T. rex, stating that this \\"feels like an artificial attempt to extend the game's longevity and results only in frustration.\\" Benjamin Sones of Computer Games Magazine praised the large environments but was critical of the dinosaur A.I. Sones concluded that the game was fun for a while but he believed that players would likely become tired of the game long before they gain sufficient points to hunt larger animals. Li Kuo of PC Gamer praised the graphics, atmosphere and dinosaurs, but noted some graphical glitches and criticized the limited weapon choices. Kuo concluded that it was one of the better hunting games available at the time. Christopher Michael Baker of AllGame stated that Carnivores 2 was \\"almost exactly the same\\" as its predecessor aside from new weapons, landscapes and dinosaurs, writing, \\"If you were to look at screenshots of the two side by side, actually, you might not even be able to tell the difference. And WizardWorks didn't even bother to change the opening menu screen! [...] In essence, Carnivores 2 is more of an expansion disc than a sequel.\\" Baker considered the game's sound to be the most impressive part of the game. He also praised the graphics but noted that they were nearly identical to the game's predecessor.

Beginning in Carcassonne in 1141, Roger was the first Trencavel ruler to appoint vicars to go about the vicecomital business at the local level. He appointed vicars both from within his court and without the regions which they were supposed to administer. It is clear, however, that Trencavel government was still rather primitive in Roger I's time. Roger I was a notable benefactor of the Order of the Temple and a fervent Crusader, making large grants to the first Templar preceptory in Occitania at Douzens. He made a grant to the Temple in 1133 of the village of Brucafel \\"that Omnipotent God in his mercy should make us and our posterity live in good perseverance, and that after the course of this life should deign to receive us in a good end.\\" In July 1147 Roger endeavoured to join the Second Crusade and so granted to the preceptory of Douzens the village of Campagne-sur-Aude with all jurisdiction in return for their taking up the mortgage of 3,000 solidi of Urgell on the land. Roger also exempted the Templars from taxes, such as the usaticum, on all his lands. He left from Agde on the Crusade after being released from the encumbrance of his mortgage later in 1147.

While the explosion was felt over 25 miles away, only one worker was killed, and no other serious injuries were reported.Detroit News, January 30, 1900 page 1Detroit Free Press, January 31, 1900, page 6 Explosives The explosives that detonated in the explosion were stored in a shanty at the quarry. Due to a delivery the previous day, there were approximately 2,450 pounds of dynamite in the shanty at the time of the explosion. The foreman at the quarry, Thomas Fitzpatrick, reported a small explosion, similar to a normal quarry blast, immediately before the large one. He suggested that a single stick of dynamite may have been accidentally dropped. The resulting small explosion could have set off the entire shanty. The true cause of the explosion was never determined. Victims The only worker killed in the explosion was Nelson Burbo. He was reported as being 48 and 60 years old. Burbo was survived by his wife and ten children. He had over 35 years experience at the quarry, ten to fifteen of it as a dynamiter. The only remains that were found were a couple of bone fragments, some scraps of his clothing, and a portion of his watch. The only reported injury was to Thomas Fitzpatrick's wife who was superficially cut by broken window glass. Charles Freedon was crippled in this explosion according to newspaper articles written at the time of his death. Damage The magazine shanty was totally destroyed, leaving a crater fifteen feet across and ten feet deep. Thomas Fitzpatrick's house was about 200 feet away from the site of the blast and was heavily damaged. Windows were broken through the towns of Trenton and Wyandotte, and the explosion was heard and felt throughout the city of Detroit and even as far away as Grosse Pointe. One notable bit of damage is a clock owned by John Turski was knocked off his mantle and stopped at 10:33, marking the time of the explosion.

The dentsivka is often commonly called a sopilka. However, it differs from the true sopilka in that the dentsivka has a fipple, like the western European recorder. It is thus classified as a duct flute. Usually, it is made from a tube of wood approximately 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in.) in length. Tone holes are cut or burnt into the tube and a fipple is made at one end. If the fipple is on the top of the instrument on the same plane as the playing holes, instead of the underside, the instrument is technically a kosa dudka (), though the distinction is not often made. The internal diameter is usually 12 to 14 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in.), with the walls of the tube being 2 to 3 mm (0.08 to 0.12 in.) thick. In the traditional instruments, the tuning varied with the length of the tube, but was usually diatonic, with a range of two and a half octaves. Some dentsivkas from Western Ukraine have only five tone holes. In recent times, chromatic ten-hole fingering was developed for this instrument that has carried on to most of the other instruments in the sopilka family. The dentsivka is made in a number of sizes, including piccolo tuned in F, prima in C, alto in G, tenor in F, and bass in C. Concert versions of the prima are available, the best being sold in Ukrainian music stores under the name \\"mala fleita\\". Dvodentsivka and pivtoradentsivka The dvodentsivka () (Dubeldentsivka, Zholomiha, Zholomiga) literally means two dentsivkas. To make it, two dentsivkas are joined together into one instrument. The pivtoradentsivka () is translated as one and a half dentsivkas. It consists of two dentsivkas joined together into one instrument, but with only one of the pipes having fingerholes. The other acts as a drone. The drone pipe in a pivtoradentsivka is usually shorter than the playing pipe. The instrument has the same fingering as the standard dentsivka.

Variations in normal track movement that add thrill or excitement to the ride are often called \\"thrill elements\\". Common elements Banked turn A banked turn is when the track twists from the horizontal plane into the vertical plane, tipping the train to the side in the direction of the turn. Banking is used to minimize the lateral G-forces on the riders to make the turn more comfortable. When a banked turn continues to create an upward or downward spiral of approximately 360 degrees or more, it becomes a helix. Brake run A brake run on a roller coaster is any section of track meant to slow or stop a roller coaster train. Brake runs may be located anywhere or hidden along the circuit of a coaster and may be designed to bring the train to a complete halt or to simply adjust the train's speed. The vast majority of roller coasters do not have any form of braking on the train but rather forms of braking that exist on track sections. One notable exception is the scenic railway roller coaster, which relies on an operator to manually control the speed of the train. On most roller coasters, the brakes are controlled by a computer system. Some older coasters have manually operated friction or skid brakes, some with a pneumatic assist. These are either engaged at the control panel or operated by pulling or pushing large levers in the station. Buzz bars Single-position lap bars on wooden roller coasters are sometimes referred to as \\"buzz bars,\\" a slang term named for the buzzing sound that some bars make as they lock or release. The term can be misleading as the buzzing sound only occurs on Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) trains when the solenoid that releases the bar is out of alignment. There are other train types, such as NAD and even some PTC trains, that feature a single-position lap bar that has a mechanical release and therefore does not produce a buzzing sound. Most parks have switched to individual ratcheting lap bars, similar to the lap bars found on steel coasters. Ironically some of the earlier ratcheting lap bar conversions use a solenoid release and can also produce a buzzing sound. It can be argued that single-position buzz bars give more air time on roller coasters, as ratcheting lap bars tend to lock further during the ride in many installations. The traditional \\"pirate ship\\" style thrill ride often utilizes this type of restraint, as does the Troika. Drive tire A drive tire, or squeeze tire depending on its usage, is essentially a motorized tire used to propel a roller coaster train along a piece of track. Although they are most often used in station areas and brake runs, they can also be used to launch trains at greater speeds. However, they are generally used to propel the train at speeds between 5-8 mph. The Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure is notable for using drive tires to launch the train up an incline. Some roller coasters, most noticeably Vekoma Roller Skaters (Vekoma's version of a junior coaster) and Zierer Tivoli/Force (also junior coasters) also use drive tires instead of a chain on lift hills. Drive tires are also used to power other types of amusement rides, such as ferris wheels, Pirate Ships, and other spinning rides. The Olympia Looping traveling roller coaster at Barth, Alpina Bahn and Mindbender at Galaxyland at the West Edmonton Mall also feature a drive tire instead of a chain on their lift hill. Drive tires are often used in one of two ways on roller coasters. When oriented horizontally, drive tires are often put in pairs so as to \\"squeeze\\" a portion of the train as it crosses that section of track. In this case, it is usually the brake fin that is used to propel or slow the train with the tires. When oriented vertically, they contact the underside of the train as it crosses a particular section of track. This underside area is a flat area which often has a grated metal surface to increase friction between the car and the tire. One disadvantage of vertical drive tires is that rainy weather can greatly reduce friction between the tire and the train, possibly causing the train to slightly overshoot its intended position and cause an emergency stop. Headchopper A headchopper is any point on a roller coaster where the support structure of the ride or the track itself comes very close to the passengers' heads, or at least appears to do so. All head choppers are, of course, designed so that even the tallest rider, with both hands up, would be unable to touch the structure; although if a rider exceeding the maximum height does board the coaster it could be potentially dangerous. Head choppers are most common on wooden roller coasters but are also found on many steel roller coasters. The inverted coaster equivalent is a foot chopper. Foot choppers are designed such that riders' legs appear to come close to the ride's support structure, water, or other ride surroundings. For example, Dragon Challenge at Islands of Adventure had many foot choppers, where the riders' feet come within feet of the ride's supports. Vekoma's Suspended Looping Coasters also feature an intense foot chopper during an in-line-twist, in which the train approaches a section of track directly below, making it appear that the riders' feet will impact the track if the train remains on that course; but the train undergoes an in-line-twist right before the obstruction, twisting the riders onto their backs as the above track crosses safely over the track below. On Wing Coasters designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, keyhole elements are common. These elements feature both headchopper and foot chopper effects. The train seats riders in pairs on both sides of the track and passes through the center of an object, giving the illusion that the train and its passengers have just enough clearance to fit. Helix A helix is a balanced spiral, generally exceeding 360¬∞. Helixes can spiral upward or downward. Launch track Speed Monster (2006), at Tusenfryd of Norway, prominently features a launch track. A launch track is a section of a launched roller coaster in which the train is accelerated to its full speed in a matter of seconds. A launch track is always straight and is usually banked upward slightly, so that a train would roll backward to the station in the event of a loss of power. A launch track serves the same basic purpose as a lift hill--providing energy to the train--but accomplishes it in an entirely different manner. A lift hill gives the train potential energy by raising it to the highest point in the track (and not significantly accelerating it). A launch track gives the train kinetic energy by accelerating it to the maximum designed speed (while not significantly raising the height of the track). A launch track normally includes some form of brakes. Depending on the type of coaster, these brakes may be used in every run of the coaster (this is normally found on a shuttle roller coaster where the launch track also serves as the main brake run) or they may only come into play when a rollback occurs, normally on a complete-circuit coaster such as Stealth, Top Thrill Dragster, Kingda Ka, Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith and Xcelerator. In either case, the brakes are retracted to allow trains to launch and are engaged at all other times. Lift hill Goliath (2002), in Walibi Holland of the Netherlands, has a lift hill. A lift hill, or chain lift, is often the initial upward section of track on a typical roller coaster that initially transports the roller coaster train to an elevated point. Upon reaching the top, the train is then disengaged from the lift hill and allowed to coast through the rest of the roller coaster's circuit. Lift hills usually propel the train to the top of the ride via one of a few different types of methods: a chain lift involving a long, continuous chain which trains hook on to and are carried to the top; a drive tire system in which multiple motorized tires push the train upward; a cable lift system as seen on Millennium Force; or a linear synchronous motor system as seen on Maverick. Launch lift hills are like launch tracks, but instead of having it flat, it is rather at an incline. Sometimes, launch lift hills serve the same purpose as lift hills but faster transport to the top of the lift hill; or they are sometimes used to power the train up into an element, like the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal Orlando. Launch lift hills use mostly linear synchronous motors or linear induction motors but sometimes use drive tires. Linear induction motor The linear induction motor is a simple but powerful type of electric motor used to propel the cars. Rather than using a standard enclosed spinning rotor and drive wheels, there is a long flat magnetic pole plate with closely spaced electric coils. This pole plate mounts on the track underneath the car and a matching metal plate attached to the car moves across the magnetic pole faces. By applying a multiphase alternating current to the poles, the pole plate induces eddy currents into the moving plate and can be used to accelerate or brake the car. Compared to other drive mechanisms, the linear motor is typically maintenance-free. The pole faces on the track and moving plate attached to the car do not need to touch, and the gap between them can be quite wide to accommodate any side-to-side car motion, so there is no friction or wear between them. Further, the magnetic coil assembly on the driving pole plates are either potted or sealed in a weathertight enclosure, so that rain, vibration, and dust do not affect motor performance or cause drive motor slippage. On-ride camera An on-ride camera is a camera mounted alongside the track of a roller coaster that automatically photographs all of the riders on passing trains. They are usually mounted at the most intense part of the ride, to capture the best possible pictures. The pictures are available for viewing and purchase at a booth outside the ride's exit. On some rides, such as Saw: The Ride at Thorpe Park and Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit at Universal Studios Florida, video, as well as still photographs, can be purchased upon exiting the ride. Station The station is the area where guests waiting in a line queue board a roller coaster. The line often divides into lanes to allow guests to board each row. In addition to boarding, passengers also exit the ride within the station, but this is not always at the same location where boarding passengers are waiting. Train A roller coaster train describes the vehicle(s) which transports passengers around a roller coaster's circuit. More specifically, a roller coaster train is made up of two or more \\"cars\\" which are connected by some sort of specialized universal joint. The vehicle is called a \\"train\\" due to its similarities with a railroad train. Individual cars vary in design, often carrying multiple passengers each. Some roller coasters, notably Wild Mouse roller coasters, operate with individual cars instead of trains. Tester hill Diagram of a tester hill A tester hill, also known as a trick hill or pre-drop, is any small hill following the lift hill that precedes the main drop. After a train is hauled up the lift and begins to descend down the hill in a standard configuration, the force of gravity pulls the train cars that are still hooked to the lift. When a tester hill is used, the tension and stress on the lift mechanism is reduced prior to the train's release. The element is commonly found on B&M; roller coasters, as well as older roller coasters from other manufacturers. The alternative name \\"trick hill\\" comes from the illusion created from the tester hill, which \\"tricks\\" riders into thinking they have already started the main descent, when in fact they haven't. Tunnels The tunnel entrance of 'Oblivion' at Alton Towers Resort Some roller coasters feature tunnels, and they may include special effects such as lighting, fog, and sound. The Iron Rattler at Six Flags Fiesta Texas, for example, features a darkened, above-ground tunnel.http://www.upsdownsandupsidedown.com/iron-rattler/ Non-inverting track elements Grand National Camelback A camelback or camelback hill is a hump-shaped hill that travels in a straight line designed to lift riders out of their seats and provide a feeling of weightlessness, commonly known as airtime. It produces negative g-force to achieve the effect. The term has been used to describe a series of smaller hills typically found near the end of a track's layout, which is a common finale on older wooden coasters. A modern coaster's implementation of a camelback can be a much larger, single hill often found earlier in the track's layout. Double dip Jack Rabbit's double dip A double dip element, also known as a double drop or double down, is created when a hill is divided into two separate drops by a flattening out of the drop midway down the hill. A notable ride featuring this element is Jack Rabbit, a 1920 coaster classic from John A. Miller located at Kennywood amusement park. The inverse of this element is known as a double up, where two inclines are separated by a level piece of track. Stampida at Portaventura Park is an example that incorporates both a double dip and a double up element. Hammerhead turn Behemoth's hammerhead turn A hammerhead turn is based on a flying maneuver by the same name and is similar to, but not the same as, a 180-degree overbanked turn (). The train enters the element with a steep slope up and a slight curve in the direction opposite that of the overall turn (a so-called \\"priming\\" of the turn). The train then banks heavily to the side opposite the initial curve and finishes its climb while it negotiates the overall turn, beginning its descent midway through the turn. The second half of the element is the same as the first half, but in reverse order. While negotiating a hammerhead turn element, the train makes a turn of more than 180 degrees; however, because of the entry and exit curves, the overall effect is that of a 180-degree turn that exits toward the direction from which it entered, roughly parallel to the portion of track preceding the hammerhead turn. Hammerhead turns are found on some B&M; hypercoasters. Examples of these coasters are Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure, Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, Diamondback at Kings Island and Mako at SeaWorld Orlando. Horseshoe A horseshoe is a type of turnaround maneuver found on Maurer Rides GmbH's Spinning Coaster model. The horseshoe is essentially a 180-degree turnaround with high banking so that riders are tilted at a 90-degree angle or more at the top at the element. The horseshoe is named that way because the element is shaped roughly like a horseshoe, with a semicircular shape at the top. It is found on coasters such as Dragon's Fury at Chessington World of Adventures and Laff Trakk at Hersheypark. Junior Immelmann loop A junior Immelmann loop is similar to a normal Immelmann loop, except riders are not inverted and only roll to 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees. The element first appeared on Black Mamba at Phantasialand. Icon's Junior Immelman Non- inverting loop Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit's non-inverting loop The non- inverting loop is a variety of loop that, when coming up, twists similar to a heartline roll, leaving riders completely right-side-up when at the top of the loop. Some roller coasters with this element include Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit at Universal Studios Florida, Shock at Rainbow MagicLand, Superman: Ultimate Flight at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, Flying Aces at Ferrari World, Soaring with Dragon at Hefei Wanda Theme Park, DC Rivals Hypercoaster at Warner Bros. Movie World and Tempesto at Busch Gardens Williamsburg. Overbanked turn An overbanked turn is a turn or curve in which the track tilts beyond 90 degrees, usually in the 100-120 degree range. The element is common on large steel roller coasters, particularly those built by Intamin and Rocky Mountain Construction. Two examples of an overbanked turn in the United States are the first turn-around on Superman the Ride at Six Flags New England, and Millennium Force at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, which features four separate and two consecutive overbanked turns. Top Thrill Dragster top hat at Cedar Point, Sandusky, Ohio A Stengel dive combines an overbanked turn with a camelback hill. The train first goes up a regular camelback hill, then quickly tilts beyond 90 degrees at the very top. It is the only roller coaster element named after its designer, in this case Werner Stengel. Examples of roller coasters that feature this element include Goliath at Walibi Holland and Thunderbolt at Luna Park. Speed hill A speed hill, also known as a high- speed float, is an airtime element commonly found in Bolliger & Mabillard steel coasters and Rocky Mountain Construction wooden coasters. The element is a mini-version of camelback entered at a high speed, which results in significant negative G-forces that exceed a typical camelback. Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City are two roller coasters that feature this element. Top hat A top hat, also known as top cap, is an element typically found on launched coasters. The element consists of 90-degree ascent up a hill, followed by a 90-degree descent; the train exits in the same direction from which it entered. In a standard configuration, the track twists so that the train does not invert during the ride. Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point and Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure are two roller coasters that feature a top hat element. In a top hat inversion, also called an inside top hat or inverted top hat, the track makes a 90-degree twist as the train approaches the top. The train is on the inside of the element, and once it reaches the apex, the train is inverted. Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast at Six Flags St. Louis is one example that features this variant. Wave turn A wave turn, commonly found on Rocky Mountain Construction roller coasters, is a 90-degree banked turn that incorporates a small camelback hill. The airtime feature separates wave turns from typical banked turns. When a train banks either right or left into an inclined turn, it traverses an airtime hill while banked at 90 degrees. The element finishes with the train exiting in the opposite direction that it entered. Inverting elements Banana roll A banana roll is an inversion element named after its shape that is similar to an elongated cobra roll. It first appeared on Takabisha at Fuji-Q Highland in 2011. The element may invert riders once, as it does on Takabisha and TMNT Shellraiser (Nickelodeon Universe), or it may invert riders twice as it does on Steel Curtain at Kennywood. Batwing Afterburn's batwing A batwing is a heart-shaped roller coaster element that features two inversions. The train goes into a reverse sidewinder, followed by a sidewinder. It is the inverse of a cobra roll. Like other inversions, this element has different names depending on the roller coaster's manufacturer. It is most commonly known as a batwing, which is the term used by Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M;). Afterburn at Carowinds and Montu at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are two examples that feature this element. On Arrow Dynamics coasters, such as the defunct The Great American Scream Machine at Six Flags Great Adventure, the element is known as a boomerang.  Bent Cuban eight  A bent Cuban eight is a double inversion element that features two \\"bent and twisted\\" Immelmann loops that are connected back to back. Designed by Maurer Rides GmbH, the element only appears on two X-Car roller coaster models from the company, including G Force that was at Drayton Manor Theme Park. Bowtie The Bowtie element on Dragon Mountain. A bowtie is an element similar to the batwing, except the entrance and exit of the inversion are in the same direction. Dragon Mountain at Marineland of Canada is the only coaster to feature this element. Butterfly Blue Hawk at Six Flags Over Georgia, the butterfly can be seen near the middle. A butterfly is sometimes found on Vekoma roller coasters. A butterfly begins like a vertical loop, but as the track goes up, it twists 45 degrees to one side or the other, and then when it is headed down the track twists back. The maneuver is then repeated but in reverse. It is essentially the same in construction as a batwing or boomerang except for the coaster exiting the construct traveling in the same direction as it began. An example of this is found on Goudurix in Parc Ast√©rix in Plailly, France, or Blue Hawk at Six Flags Over Georgia. Cobra roll A typical cobra roll, as seen on Alpengeist (1997) at Busch Gardens Williamsburg. The cobra roll is a roller coaster inversion that resembles the shape of a cobra head when flaring its hood. The element consists of two half vertical loops facing the same direction joined together by two half corkscrews that each twist in opposite directions. As the train completes the first half loop, it turns perpendicular into a half corkscrew, completing a first inversion. This is immediately followed by another half corkscrew that twists in the opposite direction into the other half vertical loop, completing a second inversion. The train exits the cobra roll traveling in the opposite direction from which it entered. Vekoma's Boomerang was the first model to incorporate a cobra roll, and the first Boomerang installation was Sea Serpent at Morey's Piers in 1984. Corkscrew Corkscrew at Cedar Point A corkscrew inversion resembles a helix that rotates riders 360¬∞ perpendicular to the track. It was named for its resemblance of a corkscrew tool, which is used to remove bottle corks. Unlike vertical loops, riders remain facing forward for the entire duration of the inversion. The corkscrew was the first modern-day inversion element to be featured on a roller coaster. It first appeared in 1975 with the release of Corkscrew, a roller coaster at Knott's Berry Farm designed by Arrow Dynamics. The element was well-received and became a staple of many early roller coasters that inverted riders. Corkscrews commonly exist in pairs, where the end of one leads straight into the next. Another configuration involves interlocking corkscrews, where two corkscrews are intertwined, with each crossing over the other's track. Both Nemesis Inferno at Thorpe Park and Bizarro at Six Flags Great Adventure feature interlocking corkscrews. Bolliger & Mabillard introduced a variation of the corkscrew that the company calls a flat spin. Flat spins snap riders quickly through the inversion at varying speeds, as opposed to a standard corkscrew that rotates riders at slower, constant speeds. Cutback A cutback is a roller coaster inversion similar to a corkscrew, except the second-half of the element is reversed. The train exits the inversion in the opposite direction from which it entered. Arrow Dynamics debuted the feature on Drachen Fire at Busch Gardens Williamsburg in 1992. It can also be found on other coasters such as Twisted Timbers at Kings Dominion, Steel Curtain at Kennywood Park, and Wonder Woman Golden Lasso Coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. Dive drop A dive drop (also known as a Wing Over Drop) is a roller coaster inversion in which a half-inline twist is performed at the top of a lift hill, leading into the initial drop. Examples that feature this element include The Swarm at Thorpe Park, X-Flight at Six Flags Great America, and GateKeeper at Cedar Point. Dive loop The top configuration is a dive loop (Dragon Khan (1995), PortAventura Park in the resort PortAventura World, Spain) A dive loop, also known as a diving loop, is a type of B&M; and Gerstlauer roller coaster inversion whose inspiration was taken from a stunt plane maneuver. The track twists upward and to the side and then dives toward the ground in a half-vertical loop. This element is common on many B&M; roller coasters. Arrow and Vekoma use a similar version of the element known as a reverse sidewinder, as seen in Arrow's Cyclone at Dreamworld in Australia and Vekoma's Ninja at Six Flags over Georgia. Heartline roll inline twist (left) has an axis of rotation centered on the track. A heartline roll (right) has an axis of rotation centered on the rider (usually at chest level). A heartline roll, also known as a barrel roll, is a roller coaster inversion in which the rider performs a 360-degree roll. The center of the train rotates on one axis. The track changes in elevation to keep the train moving in the same line in which it entered the element. In an in-line twist, a similar element, the track remains straight at the same elevation. The point of rotation is either above or below the rider's point of view, unlike a heartline roll which keeps the point of rotation near the middle. An example of this element is Colossus at Thorpe Park, which features five heartline rolls, or The Smiler, which has its first inversion as a heartline roll. Immelmann Afterburn (1999)'s Immelmann. An Immelmann is a popular inversion found on many B&M; roller coasters. In an Immelmann, riders enter a half-loop followed by a half twist, and then exit the element traveling in the opposite direction making a 180-degree turn. The inversion is similar to the sidewinder which exits closer to 90¬∞, or perpendicular to the entrance point. An Immelmann loop becomes a dive loop if the entrance and exit points are reversed. The name \\"Immelmann\\" comes from the Immelmann turn, an aircraft maneuver named after the World War I German fighter pilot Max Immelmann. Immelmanns are commonly found as the first element on B&M; Dive Coasters. A notable example is Valravn at Cedar Point, which has an Immelmann loop immediately following the first drop. Inclined dive loop GateKeeper's inclined dive loop An inclined dive loop is essentially a dive loop that has been tilted. Instead of exiting vertically, an inclined dive loop exits at an angle. The only two examples are on Hydra the Revenge at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom and GateKeeper at Cedar Point. Inclined loop Chang's (1997) inclined loop element. An inclined loop, also known as an oblique loop, is a 360¬∞ loop that has been tilted at an angle. It is not entered vertically, like a vertical loop, or horizontally like a helix. Instead, it is usually entered at an angle between 45¬∞ and 80¬∞. Inclined loops can be found on B&M; stand-up roller coasters, B&M; Wing Coasters, and B&M; Floorless Coasters. Examples include: Rougarou at Cedar Point; Green Lantern at Six Flags Great Adventure; Riddler's Revenge at Six Flags Magic Mountain; and The Swarm at Thorpe Park. In-line twist The in-line twist on Furius Baco at Portaventua Park An in-line twist is a roller coaster inversion in which the rider performs a 360-degree roll. The in-line twist is often found on flying coasters and wing coasters, such as Galactica at Alton Towers, Batwing at Six Flags America, Superman: Ultimate Flight at Six Flags Over Georgia, Firehawk at Kings Island, Manta at SeaWorld Orlando, Raptor at Gardaland and The Swarm at Thorpe Park. It can be confused with a heartline roll, also known as a barrel roll. In a heartline roll the center of the train rotates on one axis so the height of the average rider's heart never changes, whereas during an in-line twist the train rotates around the track and there is usually little to no elevation difference in the track. It can also provide hangtime. Norwegian loop Speed Monster's Norwegian loop A Norwegian loop is an element made out of two elements: a dive loop, then an Immelmann; forming an inversion that looks like two side by side loops. This element is similar to the flying coasters pretzel loop, except that the train goes through a twist when entering and exiting the loop. It may also been seen as a normal loop entered from the top. It was first introduced on Speed Monster in TusenFryd, Norway (hence why it is called a \\"Norwegian\\" Loop). Other examples of a Norwegian Loop can be found on Hersheypark's roller coaster Fahrenheit and Helix at Liseberg. Pretzel knot Banshee's pretzel knot. A pretzel knot is an element similar to the batwing, except the entrance and exit of the inversion is formed differently. In a pretzel knot, the twisted formation of the element's entrance and exit resembles a pretzel shape as opposed to a batwing's heart shape. The defunct Moonsault Scramble at Fuji-Q Highland was the first coaster to feature this element. The second was Banshee at Kings Island. Pretzel loop Tatsu's (2006) pretzel loop The pretzel loop is a large inversion found on flying coasters from Bolliger & Mabillard. The element debuted on Superman: Ultimate Flight at Six Flags Over Georgia and has been used on many other B&M; flying coasters since then. It consists of a downward half loop and upward half loop. The entrance and exit points of the loop overlap at its peak forming a shape resembling a pretzel. Raven turn A raven turn is a half-inversion which looks like half a loop followed by a drop and then levels out near the same height as it began. The raven turn is only usable on either flying roller coasters or 4D roller coasters at the moment and has only been used on three 4D coasters and one flying coaster. The general term raven turn refers to any inversion that follows the design described above; however, there are two types of raven turns. Assuming the train is going round the half-loop first, an inside raven turn is where the rails are below the train at the start whereas an outside raven turn is one in which the rails are above the train at the start of the element. X¬≤ at Six Flags Magic Mountain, Eejanaika at Fuji-Q Highland, and Dinoconda at China Dinosaurs Park are examples of raven turns. Roll over The 'Roll over' Inversion on 'Infusion' at Blackpool Pleasure Beach This element, known as a roll over on roller coasters built by Vekoma, is an inversion featuring two half loop halves, connected by two opposite-facing half inline twists. This inversion can be found on the most Vekoma SLCs. Sea serpent The sea serpent is a roller coaster element with two inversions similar to a cobra roll, but the train enters and exit in the same direction. It features two vertical loop halves connected by two half corkscrews that face in opposite directions. The second half loop is on the opposite side in comparison to a cobra roll, which changes the exit's direction. Examples featuring this element include Vekoma's Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith located at Disney's Hollywood Studios and The Smiler at Alton Towers. Sidewinder A sidewinder is an inversion element where riders enter a half-loop followed by a half-corkscrew, and then exit the element perpendicular to the direction in which they entered. The element is commonly found on Arrow and Vekoma roller coasters. It is similar to the Immelmann loop, with the exception that riders exit in a different direction usually 90 degrees from the entrance point. Twisted horseshoe roll Maverick's (2007) twisted horseshoe roll. A twisted horseshoe roll is an inversion element that begins with a corkscrew that leads into a 180-degree banked turn and ends with another corkscrew that rotates in the opposite direction as the first. Two roller coasters that feature this element are Maverick at Cedar Point (United States) and Blue Fire at Europa-Park (Germany). Vertical loop Full Throttle's loop at Six Flags Magic Mountain is one of the world's tallest and largest vertical loops at . A vertical loop is one of the most common roller coaster inversions in existence. It is a continuous, upward-sloping section of track that eventually completes a 360-degree turn, inverting riders halfway into the element. They are ellipses in the shape of an oval or teardrop. Early roller coaster designs attempted vertical loops that were more circular, resulting in massive g-force that were dangerous to riders. The first successful implementation in the modern era of roller coasters was on Great American Revolution which opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain in 1976. Loch Ness Monster's (1978) interlocking loops Arrow Dynamics designed two roller coasters that featured interlocking loops, which consist of one vertical loop perpendicular to the other. Loch Ness Monster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg opened in 1977 followed by Orient Express at Worlds of Fun in 1980. The Lightnin' Loops installation at Six Flags Great Adventure featured two looping roller coasters with similar interlocking loops. Zero-g roll The Incredible Hulk (1999), Universal's Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida) A zero-g roll or zero-gravity roll is a roller coaster inversion where the track twists 360 degrees as it rises and falls in elevation, usually at the crest of a hill. The element gets its name from the weightless effect of zero g-force that a rider experiences during the inversion. Zero-g stall A zero-g stall or zero-gravity stall, sometimes referred to as a top gun stall, is an inversion similar to a zero-g roll, however after the track has twisted 180 degrees on the ascent, it stays inverted for a short section at the crest and then twists back on the descent, usually in the opposite direction as the initial twist. Similar to a zero-g roll, riders experience a feeling of weightlessness during the short inverted section. This element is commonly found on Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) installations including Goliath and Wildfire. S&S; has also included this element in Kennywood's Steel Curtain. Visual elements Splashdown Griffon Splashdown element A splashdown is a visual element in which the ride vehicle physically interacts with a body of water, forcefully spraying or jetting water on impact. Splashdowns can be used as a natural braking system, and some coasters feature pathways for non-riding visitors to view or get wet from the splashdown element. There are two types. * A natural splashdown is an element in which the track of the vehicle partially submerges underwater. It is featured on several roller coasters such as Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland. * A scoop splashdown is an element in which each train is equipped with two tubes ‚Äì called scoops ‚Äì on the rear sides of each train. The scoops are angled upward, causing water to spray as the train passes close to a body of water. A number of Bolliger & Mabillard coasters feature the element, such as Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa, and Diamondback at Kings Island. Depending on the width of the train and the angle of the scoops, the effect can produce different results, such as two distinct streams (Griffon) or one large plume (Diamondback). Water spout A water spout is a visual element encompassing a number of different methods to simulate a roller coaster's interaction with a body of water ‚Äì the ride vehicle does not make contact with the water. Water spouts are intended to be visually appealing. The following are some examples of roller coasters that utilize this effect. * Atlantis Adventure at Lotte World in South Korea features a variety of water effects including water spouts that fire in synchronized fashion in more than one area of the ride. * Hyperion at Energylandia in Poland has a water feature immediately before the final brake run. * The Incredible Hulk at Universal's Islands of Adventure has a water spout that fires immediately following its zero-G roll as the train dives toward the water below. * Manta at SeaWorld Orlando utilizes both water spouts and fountains that synchronize at the point the train dips toward the water, giving the illusion it is skimming the water's surface. * Maverick at Cedar Point features several water spouts that fire upward as the train rounds a turn.

Biography Early life Jimmy Lee Sudduth was born on March 10, 1910. He was raised on a farm at Caines Ridge, near Fayette, Alabama. He began making art as a child, surrounding the porch of his parents' house with hand-carved wooden dolls and drawing in the dirt or on tree trunks outside. As his talents became known in the community he began collecting pigments from earth, rocks plants, foodstuffs, and industrial products for use in his finger paintings. He used his fingers because \\"they never wore out.\\" His numerous works were typically executed on found surfaces such as plywood, doors, and boards from demolished buildings. He experimented with mixing his pigments with various binders to make them adhere better, including syrup, sugar, soft drinks, and caulk. Dog,1986 at the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts Career His first public art exhibition was held in 1968 at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa. A 1971 exhibition in his home town of Fayette earned regional attention and, beginning that year, he became a featured artist at the annual Kentuck Festival of the Arts in Northport, Alabama. In 1976, he was invited to play harmonica and exhibit some of his painting at the Smithsonian Institution's Bicentennial Festival of American Folk Life. He appeared on the Today Show and 60 Minutes in 1980. He was honored with the Alabama Arts Award in 1995 and served as an artist-in-residence at the New Orleans Museum of Art. His work is featured in many collections, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum https://americanart.si.edu/artist/jimmy-lee-sudduth-5874, the High Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery, the Birmingham Museum of Art and the House of Blues. He was one of the early masters of southern art. He was an active member of his community, and his work, though idiosyncratic, is firmly grounded in the African American culture of the rural South. He drew his subject matter from the world around him: people he knew (and celebrities), architecture, farm scenes, machinery, flowers, and animals of e woods and barnyard. Very rarely, he portrayed a religious figure such as Christ, Moses, or John the Baptist.Susan Mitchell Crawley, The Life and Art of Jimmy Lee Sudduth, (Montgomery, Alabama: River City Publishing, 2005), 17-27. Although it is commonly believed that Sudduth's early paintings were executed exclusively in mud and found pigments, such as motor oil or plant juices, in fact, his earliest known paintings contain large amounts of house paint. As his fame grew, dealers advised Sudduth on ways to make his works more permanent and more colorful, and by the 1990s, no longer able to collect his own materials, he began using commercially-sold acrylic paints, applied with sponge brushes onto wood panels prepared with a flat black ground. Death Having resisted leaving his home as long as he could, Sudduth spent his last year at the Fayette Nursing Home. He died at the Fayette Medical Center on September 2, 2007 at the age of 97.

Rowley and starring Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Joan Allen, Tom Skerritt, and Christine Baranski. The screenplay by Daniel D. Davis is based on a story by Davis and Rowley. Plot When Arvilla Holden's considerably older husband Joe dies while the two are vacationing in Borneo, she has his remains cremated and returns with them to their home in Pocatello, Idaho with plans to scatter them as he wished. Joe's resentful daughter from his first marriage, Francine, demands Arvilla relinquish the ashes so they can be buried in the family crypt in Montecito, California and threatens to sell Arvilla's home, which was left to Francine in her father's original will, unless she cooperates. Arvilla grudgingly agrees and invites her best friends, single and lonely Margene, a former teacher who lost her job because she advocated birth control to her students, and married Carol, a devout Mormon, to accompany her to the memorial service. The three women drive to Salt Lake City International Airport in Holden's refurbished 1966 Pontiac Bonneville convertible, but Arvilla decides to detour to the Bonneville Salt Flats, a place she and Joe had visited on their honeymoon. As they race across the flats, the top of the urn containing the ashes falls off and some of them are scattered in the wind. Arvilla decides to honor Joe's last request and scatter his ashes at other places they visited throughout their twenty-year-long marriage. This change of plans results in a road trip that takes the women to Bryce Canyon National Park, Skull Valley, Lake Powell, Las Vegas, and the desert near Palm Springs. During their journey they encounter Bo Douglas, a young man searching for the father he never knew, and Emmett, an aging long-distance truck driver who has devoted his life to the road ever since his wife died, in addition to exploring their friendship and themselves as they come of age for the second time.

It had an interchange with I-80 at Exit 86 and traveled a winding route heading northeast. At Red Barn Road, it made a right turn and passed the old entrance to the DuBois Regional Airport. It made a sharp right curve at Allens Mills Road where the present routing continues today. The route between US 322 and Red Barn Road is still state-maintained as SR 1830 and the section of Red Barn Road between SR 1830 and the modern-day PA 830 is SR 1013. Parts of the old PA 830 are still drivable between the PA 830 / SR 1830 intersection and Allens Mills Road, but it is not completely passable due to breaks in the pavement and the new parking lot for the airport. Construction began on the new five-mile (8-km) access road to the DuBois Airport and the new I-80 interchange in July 2004.

The instrument consists of several pipes each of which, when blown endwise, produces one sound. Various versions of the kuvytsi exist in Ukraine, such as the one-sided kuvytsi, which consist of a system of pipes from great to small in one lode or two-sided kuvytsi, which have their greatest pipe in the center. These instruments were used by ensembles in Chernihiv Province and also widely in Western Ukraine. These instruments allow chromatic notes to be readily obtained, a semitone lower than the primary sound of the pipe. This is done by bending the angle of the pipes with relation to the player's lips. The air stream is thus broken on the far end of the pipe, rather than the end closest the lips.

At first, it encompassed both the SDB and the seven unions involved in its founding ‚Äî the Dutch Cigar Makers' and Tobacco Workers' Union, Typographers' Federation, the Furnituremakers' Federation, the Brushmakers' Federation, the Carpenters' Federation, the General Dutch Diamond Workers' Union, and the railway union Steeds Voorwaarts. The NAS was declaredly politically neutral, but in practice it was dominated by the SDB. After the SDB split into the revolutionary Socialist League and the parliamentary Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) in 1894, both remained members and the NAS did not get involved in the conflict between them, but the relations between the NAS and the parties soon deteriorated to the point that in 1896 both the Socialist League and the SDAP were expelled from the NAS, leaving only unions in the organization.Marcel van der Linden, \\"The Many Faces of Dutch Revolutionary Trade Unionism,\\" in Marcel van der Linden and Wayne Thorpe (eds.), Revolutionary Syndicalism: An International Perspective. Aldershot, England: Scolar Press, 1990; pp. 46-47. By 1896 thirteen national and 16 local unions were part of the NAS. Conflict soon ensued over the distribution of financial means within the NAS. All unions in the federation had one vote, no matter what their size, but financial contributions to the union funds were on a per capita basis. Moreover, the NAS supported in principle all strikes - be they by NAS members or by non- affiliated unions or even individuals, because all strikes were seen as a learning experience for the working class. The financial shortage that resulted from this as well as increasing anarchist tendencies in the NAS soon led many of the larger unions to leave the organization. By 1903, only fifteen national, but 61 local organizations were part of the NAS.van der Linden, \\"The Many Faces of Dutch Revolutionary Trade Unionism,\\" pp. 47-48. Pre-WWI period 1903 saw relations between the NAS on the one hand and the SDAP and many of the large non-NAS unions deteriorate further. A successful general strike which started in January 1903 led to strict laws prohibiting such strikes. A \\"Resistance Committee\\" consisting of the NAS, the SDAP, and the General Diamond Workers' Union of the Netherlands (ANDB), the largest non-NAS union in the country, soon fell apart. In late 1903, the SDAP leader Pieter Jelles Troelstra then claimed the NAS was \\"done for\\". In 1906, the Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions (NVV) was founded as an SDAP-loyal union federation. It had more members than the NAS from the start.van der Linden, \\"The Many Faces of Dutch Revolutionary Trade Unionism,\\" pp. 48-49. In the following years the NAS slowly turned to syndicalism. This development was influenced by the competition with the NVV and by Christiaan Cornelissen. Cornelissen, who was influenced by the French syndicalism of the CGT developed a syndicalist theory adapted to the local orientation of the NAS. Nevertheless, the chaotic internal organization of the NAS weakened it until Harm Kolthek took over as national secretary in 1907. Under his leadership, the NAS was able to broaden its base by emphasizing its political and religious neutrality and its membership doubled to 7,200 by 1913. During this time, the NAS also started co-operating with political parties again, specifically it collaborated with the SDAP-breakaway Social Democratic Party on both a transport workers' strike in 1911 and protests against price increases in 1912. As a result of this many anarchists left the organization.van der Linden, \\"The Many Faces of Dutch Revolutionary Trade Unionism,\\" pg. 49. Post-WWI period Like most European syndicalist unions, the NAS saw its membership boom after World War I. Although the Netherlands were neutral in the war, they were not untouched by it: food shortages plagued the country and the revolutionary wave that swept Europe from 1917 to 1920 left its mark on the country. The massive wave of strikes greatly benefited the NAS, its membership rose from 10,500 in 1916 to 51,000 in 1920. During this time NAS members had great influence on the Socialist and Communist Parties. In 1922, the NAS decided to join the pro-Soviet Red International of Labour Unions (RILU), although many in the federation favored the anarcho- syndicalist International Workers Association (IWA). In 1923, the question of international affiliation led to a split. About 8,000 members left to found the IWA-affiliated Dutch Syndicalist Trade Union Federation (NSV).Ron Blom, \\"De Oude Socialistische partij\\" The NAS, however, split from the RILU in 1927 due to fear of Moscow control. After the NAS had seceded from the RILU, it was reaching to the German revolutionary trade-unions and the international revolutionary-syndicalism, which opposed soviet politics. A merge with the NSV failed because the NSV wanted to return to a pure independent foundation, while the NAS executive thought that political and economic struggle were intertwined due to increasing state intervention. Eventually, the communist opposition within the NAS was expelled. As a counterpart of the communist network of unions, the NAS founded additional organizations and an innate political party, the RSP, in 1929. Hoekman, Piet and Houkes, Jannes, \\"Het Nationaal Arbeids-Secretariaat 1839-1940\\", pp. 860, After 1920, the membership of the NAS waned reaching 13,000 in 1924. Its members were now primarily transport workers, construction workers, and Amsterdam municipal employees. In 1927, the NAS broke with the Communist Party and many of the union's leaders helped form the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) in 1928. A further wave of militancy in the Dutch labor movement helped the NAS gain members in the late 1920s, but in 1933 and 1934 the government took measures against the left after a mutiny on board the cruiser De Zeven Provinci√´n, dealing the NAS a heavy blow. Municipal employees and civil servants could now be fired for their adherence to the revolutionary movement. In the 1930s the NAS also started turning its back on syndicalism arguing that the idea that the workers should build up a socialist society themselves had failed. Although it continued losing members, the NAS existed until the German occupation of the Netherlands in 1940. The Germans forced the organization to be disbanded, but a few members continued its activities in illegality. After the war, there were no efforts to re-found the NAS.van der Linden, \\"The Many Faces of Dutch Revolutionary Trade Unionism,\\" pp. 51-54.

However, little information about that period exists in written sources. The genre gained visibility and momentum only in the new millennium due to the internet phenomenon, and in 2002 in particular, when the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO) programmed several works by Malaysian composers, namely Chong Kee Yong's Echoed Dream (2002), Sunetra Fernando's 'Wayang' (2002) and Tazul Izan Tajuddin's Sebuah Tenunan III (2003). They represent the first local commissions by a professional symphony orchestra in the country. Interest in orchestral music by Malaysian composers grew and when the orchestra held its first Forum For Malaysian Composers in 2003 the event was a triumph for the local music scene. Background The MPO forum brought together six talented young composers, Ahmad Muriz Che Rose, Chong Kee Yong, Vivian Chua, Johan Othman, Tay Poh Gek and Adeline Wong, from around the country and abroad, to Kuala Lumpur, to compose music for the orchestra. Spread over two years, the forum introduced six new compositions for chamber orchestra and four for full orchestra. Chong Kee Yong, who had won numerous awards in Europe, emerged as the winner of the forum and won the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra International Composers Award 2004 with his symphony work The Starry Night's Ripples. The Forum was also a success from the audience standpoint, as all concerts were well attended and enthusiastically received by the music-going public as well as by the media. The success of the Forum is a key factor in raising the profile on Malaysian contemporary music in Malaysia, although the composers who participated, as well as a number of others who were not represented, have been composing music in this medium for a number of years, the majority of their output having been premiered abroad. That is to say, this does not mean that there was no activity in the field prior to the Forum, only that such efforts were not highly visible or organised. Information on serious composition in the 1980s through to the 1990s by composers such as Tazul Tajuddin (whose Etudes for chamber orchestra was performed in 1995 in USA), Dr Valerie Ross (who was awarded Malaysian Young Composer (1988) by the Asian Composers' League in Hong Kong), Razak Abdul Aziz (who began composing vocal works as early as 1980) is only now slowly becoming available, although a comprehensive survey of the pre-millennium period is still in need. As cited by a Malaysian research paper in the late 1990s, the lack of such musical activities in Malaysia prior to the 21st Century is largely attributed to the absence of professional ensembles in the country who were able to support composers, although key issue has been one of a total absence of infrastructure rather than one of talent. Fortunately for the Malaysian art music scene progress in the current period has been brisk, and the number of serious composers and compositions in this field is increasing. The 2006-2007 series of Composers Forums in Kuala Lumpur, for example, introduced new voices such as Ng Chong Lim, Teh Tze Siew, Yii Kah Hoe and Mohd Yazid Zakaria. In 2008 Off The Edge magazine based in Kuala Lumpur collaborated with the Malaysian Composers Collective and HSBC Bank Malaysia Ltd to produce the country's first CD anthology of contemporary Malaysian music called Faith, Hope & Chaos. In 2009 the Malaysian Composers Collective collaborated with Goethe Institut to hold the country's first ever three-day contemporary music festival, the KL Contemporary Music Festival 09. Titled Urban Soundscapes, the festival featured guest composers from around the country and the South East Asia region and Germany, with music performed by international new music groups Ensemble Mosaik and Hong Kong New Music Ensemble with a host of Malaysian musicians. The festival held concerts, workshops and a two-day conference at Segi University College Kota Damansara, and also included a late night electroacoustic concert at the Central Market Annexe and an art exhibition on the theme of the city. KLCMF 09 also held the region's first ever Southeast Asian Young Composers Competition which received over 60 entries from Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand. This article offers only a brief introduction to Malaysia's growing contemporary music movement, in the absence of a full study on the subject. It also places emphasis on the western-based formal tradition, and on composers largely trained in this tradition, purely as a matter of focus on an area that is particularly lacking in information, notwithstanding the very notions of art music or western-based music is itself evolving rapidly today with the blurring of lines between western and eastern instruments and the smearing of borders between various genres such as avant- garde, minimalism, world music and jazz, amongst others.  Musical Language  Malaysian composers have won numerous awards abroad and at home with their rich and diverse styles of composition. At the cutting edge of the avant garde are Chong Kee Yong and Tazul Tajuddin. They have received numerous awards and accolades in Europe, Japan, Korea and elsewhere. Yii Kah Hoe is slowly exploring a similar direction as a departure, or perhaps an enrichment, of his work with Chinese orchestral music, as his award-winning composition for Chinese Orchestra Buka Panggung displays. Pianist-composer Ng Chong Lim inhabits the ground between atonalism and aleatoric music based on the live interaction of more tonal fragments. Preferring a more lyrical and tonal language, the music of Adeline Wong and Johan Othman are colourful and rhythmically vibrant. Othman in particular combines a quasi minimalist approach with elements of Malaysian aesthetics tempered with jazzy undercurrents to fashion a truly recognisable Malaysian sound, while Wong has a unique way of building complex structures from basic harmonic material and rich sound colours. Ahmad Muriz Che Rose works with a more populist approach to Malay traditional instruments in a contemporary language through his work with the Petronas Performing Arts Group. Saidah Rastam experiments with jazz and atonalism in combination with ethnic Malaysian and regional elements from gamelan to ketchak, and has even worked with reinventing Chinese Opera through atonal jazz in her work Spirits. Film and jazz composer Hardesh Singh pushes the limits in the field of jazz composition with his group 50cents Jazz Club, and brings in elements of world music and sound samples into the art.  The New Generation  A new generation of young composers are beginning to emerge in the Malaysian music scene. The inaugural HSBC Young Composers Workshop 2008 held at KLPac on 13 July 2008 was the first of its kind and an unprecedented effort to offer young composers a platform for their works to be showcased and workshopped. The workshop brought together five young composers finalists and over ten other participants in the workshops, all of whom can consider this the official starting point of their composing careers. The works of Chow Jun Yan, Chow Jun Yi, Neo Nai Wen, Ng Shyh Poh and Tan Zi Hua were selected to be workshopped by a chamber ensemble comprising flutist Vincent Kok, oboist Yong How Keen and pianists Chee Su Yen, Joyce Ho and Lee Yin Hwa. Another entry by Jessica Cho was also read at the workshop. Penang composer Tan Zi Hua took first prize with his composition Images of Wind II for flute, oboe and piano. His work was singled out by the Selection Panel for its fluency and practicality. Honorable Mention was awarded to Chin Hong Da for his entry Longing For Home for flute and piano. At the inaugural KL Contemporary Music Festival 09 in Kuala Lumpur, Chow Jun Yan, Chow Jun Yi, Lee Chie Tsang and Neo Nai Wen were finalists in the Young Composers Competition performed by leading German group Ensemble Mosaik. Chow Jun Yi won first prize in the Malaysian Young Composer Award category, and second prize in the overall Goethe South East Asian Young Composer Award (the overall winner went to Juro Kim O Feliz from Philippines). Last year's winner Tan Zi Hua was given a special commission at the Festival, and presented his Under The Homotopic Silhouettes for quintet. The Young Composers in Southeast Asia Competition and Festival 2013 was held at the College of Music, Mahidol University and Princess Galyani Vadhana Institute of Music (PGVIM) from December 9-15, 2013. It was jointly organised by the two institutions and the Goethe Institut. 10 pieces of music by the finalists - four of whom were Malaysian young composers (Ainolnaim Azizol, Tee Xiao Xi, Yeo Chow Shern and Zihua Tan) - were performed at the Music Auditorium, Mahidol University. The myriad musical styles as heard on that night were proof that Southeast Asia is a multifaceted region and home to many talented young composers. Three winners were named at the end of the night, namely: Kongmeng Liew, Yeo Chow Shern and Zihua Tan. In 2013 Kuantan- born young composer Ainolnaim Azizol represents Malaysia at the ACL Singapore Festival 2013's Young Composers Competition with his Tirai III for percussion trio. He is also a finalise at the Cologne Eight Bridges Festival 2013 competition for string quartet, with his work Badang!!!!.

She was the eldest daughter of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, younger son of King Charles X of France and Princess Caroline of Naples and Sicily. She served as regent of Parma during the minority of her son from 1854 until 1859. Early life Princess Caroline of Naples and Sicily (1798-1870), Duchesse of Berry, widow of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, with her daughter Louise Marie Th√©r√®se d'Artois Born on 21 September 1819 in the √âlys√©e Palace, in Paris, she was the first surviving child of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry and his young wife Carolina of Naples and Sicily. At the time of her birth, her uncle Louis XVIII, was the reigning king of France, but he was childless and already in decline health. Louise's grandfather was the heir to the French crown. He had only two sons. The eldest, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me had no children of his own from his marriage to Madame Royal. Therefore the continuity of the dynasty rested solely on the youngest son, Charles-Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, Louise's father. Known from her birth as Mademoiselle d'Artois, Louise did not have the chance to get to know her father. She was only five months old when the Duke of Berry was assassinated while leaving the old opera of Paris by Louis Pierre Louvel, a Bonapartist whose goal was the \\"extinction of the house of Bourbon\\". Louise was then the only child of the main branch of the royal dynasty of Bourbon descendants of Louis XV. The lack of male heirs raised the prospect of the throne passing to the Duke of Orl√©ans and his heirs, which horrified the more conservative ultras. Parliament debated the abolition of the Salic law, which excluded females from the succession and was long held inviolable. However, the widowed Duchess of Berry was found to be pregnant and on 29 September 1820 gave birth to a son, Louise's only sibling, the miracle boy Henri d'Artois (1820-1883). He received then the title of Duke of Bordeaux. Louise was brought up under the care of her mother the Duchess of Berry at the Elys√©e Palace and at Ch√¢teau de Rosny-sur-Seine, her mother's main residence. Louise's education was entrusted to Marie-Jos√©phine Louise de Montaut- Navailles (1773-1857), Marquise de Gontaut Saint-Blacard, a former Lady-in- waiting of the Duchess of Berry. The Marquise was appointed as the governess of the little girl and her brother. Until the end of her life, Louise would remain very close to her brother describing later their relationship as one soul in two bodies. Louise would remember her great-uncle King Louis XVIII as an invalid who could not move from his chair. He suffered from gangrene and died in 1824, five days before Louise's fifth birthday. During the reign of Charles X, as a granddaughter of the French king, Louise had the title 'petit- fils de France' ( daughter of France ). Her grandfather's reign (1824-1830) ended abruptly as his unpopular policies launched the July Revolution. On 2 August 1830, Charles X and his son the Dauphin abdicated their rights to the throne. Although Charles had intended that his grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux, would take the throne as Henry V, the politicians who composed the provisional government instead placed on the throne a distant cousin, Louis Philippe of the cadet House of Orl√©ans -a descendant of Louis XIV only brother-, who agreed to rule as a constitutional monarch. This period became known as the July Monarchy. Supporters of the exiled senior line of the Bourbon dynasty became known as Legitimists. On 16 August 1830, the royal family went into exile in England. Formative years Princess Louise, Mademoiselle d'Artois, portrait attributed to William Charles Ross When her grandfather abdicated in 1830, Louise joined the rest of her immediate family in exile taking refuge in the United Kingdom. For a time the Duchess of Berry and her children lived in Bath, but they later moved in order to be closer to Charles X who had settled in Scotland, at the Palace of Holyrood. The Duchess of Berry settled with her two children at 11 (now 12) Regent Terrace but did not find conditions in Edinburgh agreeable, nor did she accept her son's exclusion from the throne by the Orl√©anist \\"King of the French\\". She declared her son to be the legitimate king, and herself to be regent. In 1831 she left Edinburgh, and returned to her family in Naples via the Netherlands, Prussia, and Austria. In April 1832 she landed near Marseille. Receiving little support, she made her way to the Vend√©e and Brittany, where she succeeded in instigating a brief but abortive insurrection in June 1832. However, her followers were defeated. The Duchess of Berry was arrested in Nantes, then imprisoned in the Chateau of Blaye where she gave birth to a child born out of a secret morganitc marriage. The subsequent scandal led to the Duchess losing all her prestige. Twelve-year-old Louise and her brother were then entrusted to their aunt, the Duchess of Angouleme \\" Madame the Dauphine\\", the only surviving child of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. The family left Scotland in 1832 for Prague, in Bohemia, where Emperor Francis I of Austria offered them the Prague Castle. In 1836 they moved to the palace of Grafenberg in G√∂rz on the Austrian Empire. There, the former King Charles X died of cholera soon after. Remarried and living in Brunnsee castle, in Eichfeld (200 km from Vienna), the Duchess of Berry never recovered the custody of her children. Louise and her brother were raised by their aunt in an austere and formal atmosphere according to the custom of the old regime. Short, plumb, and blonde with slightly bulging blue eyes, Louise resembled her father. She was witty, chatty, and with a strong character. She liked music, playing the harp, and singing. She adored her brother and they were very close. Both siblings became attached to their aunt, the Duchess of Angouleme, who, although severe, was devoted to them. They annually received the visit of their mother, the Duchess of Berry, who lived nearby and provided them with four half-siblings. After the death of their uncle the Duke of Angouleme in 1844, the siblings moved with their aunt to Schloss Frohsdorf, a baroque castle just outside Vienna. Marriage In 1832, King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, brother of the Duchess of Berry, had proposed to marry his younger brother, the Count of Lecce who was 16 years old, to Louise who was then 13. The project fizzled. The Duchess of Angoul√™me, the princess guardian, declined this proposal. Besides the young age of the princess, the prince of the Two Sicilies was her uncle and only a younger brother in a large family with little prospects, and in spite of his youth, the Count of Lecce already had a deserved reputation as a womanizer. He would have a tragic end. The Duchess of Angoul√™me also discarded the idea of marrying her nice to any Austrian Archduke. She was adamant that Louise should marry a Bourbon. as there were very few princes from where to chose from, Louise reached twenty- five still unmarried and advanced age for a single Princess of her time. Finally in 1845, the Duchess of Angouleme arranged her marriage to Hereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca. A few years younger than her, Ferdinand was the only child of the reigning duke of Lucca. He used to spend some summers near Froshdorf and they had met when they were still children. On 10 November 1845, at Schloss Frohsdorf in Austria, Louise married Hereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca. On 17 December 1847 Empress Marie Louise died and her father-in-law succeeded as Duke Charles II of Parma. The Duchy of Lucca was incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and she and her husband became known as Hereditary Prince and Hereditary Princess of Parma. Her father-in-law was Duke of Parma for a few months. In March 1848 revolution broke out in Parma supported by King Charles Albert of Sardinia. Ferdinand Charles escaped from Parma, but was taken prisoner at Cremona. He remained a prisoner at Milan for several months until the British government negotiated his release. After a brief sojourn on the island of Malta, he traveled to Naples and then Livorno where he was joined by Louise Marie Th√©r√®se who had just given birth to their first son. Then the family sought refuge in England and Scotland. In August 1848 the Austrian army entered Parma, and officially restored Charles II. Ferdinand Charles and his family, however, remained in England, since hostilities continued between the Austrian and Piedmontese armies. For several years Charles II had considered abdicating in favor of Ferdinand Charles, but he delayed in the hope that when he did so things would be more secure for his son. Duchess of Parma Louise, Duchess of Parma. Photograph, ca. the 1860s On 24 March 1849, the abdication of Charles II was announced. Ferdinand Charles, still living in England, succeeded him under the name Charles III. On 18 May 1849, Louise's husband re-entered Parma, but he left again two days later. He did not take over the administration of the duchy until 25 August. When her husband was murdered in 1854, Louise served as regent for their young son, the new duke, Robert I. Like the other rulers of the Central Italian states, she and her son were ousted during the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, and they retired to Austrian protection in Venice. Various schemes following the war, either for her and her son's restoration in Parma, or territorial swaps which might leave them ruling over Tuscany, Modena, or the Romagna, came to nothing, as the whole of central Italy was annexed by Piedmont in March 1860. Louise lived out the remainder of her life in exile. Queen Sophie of the Netherlands met Louise Marie in 1862 and described her in a letter to a friend: > The other day I made the acquaintance of the Duchesse de Parme, Count > Chambord's sister. She is much larger than Princess Mary of Cambridge, very > small, but lively, agreeable, without bitterness after so many misfortunes. > Her boys are dwarfs but full of French repart√©e and gaiety. I liked her and > pity such a lot‚Äîmurder and revolutions persecuting her since birth... According to The Month, Louise caught a cold while staying in Venice in January 1864. The Month stated that this cold was soon followed by typhus, which in turn resulted in Louise's death on February 1 of the same year.

Its etymology comes from the region Volyn, Ukraine, where it was borrowed from Romania. The volynka is constructed around a goat skin air reservoir into which air is blown through a pipe with a valve to stop air escaping. (Modern concert instruments often have a reservoir made from a basketball bladder}. A number of playing pipes [two to four] extend from the reservoir holding the air. The main playing pipe on which the melody is played has five to seven, sometimes eight finger holes. The other pipes produce a drone. This is usually either a single tonic note or a perfect fifth. Each of these playing pipes has a double reed usually made from a goose quill. In the 20th century this instrument has lost the popularity it had previously, and is rarely used today in an authentic context. Modern usage The instrument has gained popularity in stage performance. It has been used in a number of songs by Russian rock bands DDT, Aquarium, and Aria. It also appears more in Russian folk music and Ukrainian folk music ensembles.
