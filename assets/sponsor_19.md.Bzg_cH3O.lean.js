It is an important effect in electronic devices which contain narrow layers, such as field effect transistors and quantum cascade lasers. Description The energy of charged particles in a quantum well is strongly affected by its thickness Interface roughness scattering is most noticeable in confined systems, in which the energies for charge carriers are determined by the locations of interfaces. An example of such a system is a quantum well, which may be constructed from a sandwich of different layers of semiconductor. Variations in the thickness of these layers therefore causes the energy of particles to be dependent on their in-plane location in the layer.

The disastrous floods in Elbe and Danube rivers in 2002 confronted the European Commission with non- coherent flood warning information from different sources and of variable quality, complicating planning and organization of aid. In response to this event, the European Commission initiated the development of a European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) to increase the preparedness for floods in Europe. Following a Communication of the Commission in 2002 on the Elbe and Danube floods in 2002,Communication: Towards a Stronger European Union Disaster Response‚Äù (COM(2010) 600) the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission was assigned with the task to develop EFAS. Its development has been financially supported by DG GROW, DG ECHO, the European Parliament as well as Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia through detachment of National Experts. The aim of EFAS is to gain time for preparedness measures before major flood events strike particularly for trans-national river basins both in the Member States as well as on European level. This is achieved by providing complementary, added value information to the National hydrological services and by keeping the European Response and Coordination Centre informed about ongoing floods and about the possibility of upcoming floods across Europe. From 2005 to 2010 EFAS was tested in real-time mode, first with the National hydrological services and later also with the European Civil Protection. In 2011 EFAS became part of the Emergency Management Service of the COPERNICUS Initial Operations Regulation (EU) n¬∞911/2010, ‚ÄúThe European Parliament and the Council on the European Earth monitoring programme (GMES) from 2011 to 2013‚Äù and in support to European Civil Protection.Communication: Towards a Stronger European Union Disaster Response‚Äù (COM(2010) 600), The operational components have been outsourced to Member State organisations. EFAS is running fully operational since autumn 2012.  The operational EFAS  The European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) is the first operational European system monitoring and forecasting floods across Europe. It provides probabilistic, flood early warning information up to 10 days in advance to its partners - the National Hydrological Services and the European Response and Coordination Centre (ERCC). The operational components of EFAS have been outsourced to different centres: * EFAS hydrological data collection centre, outsourced to a Spanish consortium (Rediam and Soologic) * EFAS meteorological data collection centre, outsourced to KISTERS AG and Deutscher Wetterdienst * EFAS computational centre, outsourced to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts * EFAS dissemination centre, outsourced to a consortium of hydro-meteorological services from Sweden, the Netherlands and Slovakia. EFAS is running fully operational since October 2012 as a 7/375 service. The Central European flood event of June 2013 was the first big scale crisis during which the operational EFAS was actively reporting to the ERCC.  History  Over the last decades severe fluvial floods of trans-national dimensions have taken place in Europe. There is evidence that in particular transboundary floods can be more severe in their magnitude, affect larger areas, result in higher death tolls, and cause more financial damage than non- shared river floods do.Bakker M. H. N.: Transboundary river floods: vulnerability of continents, international river basins and countries. Ph.D Dissertation, Oregon State University, 276p. URL: http://hdl.handle.net/1957/3821, 2007. The European Environmental Agency estimated that floods in Europe between 1998 and 2002 caused about 700 deaths, the displacement of about half a million people and at least 25 billion Euros in insured economic losses (EEA, 2003). Some river basins suffered repeated flooding within a time span of a few years only ‚Äì for example the Rhine and Meuse floods in 1993 and 1995 or the Po floods in 1994 and 2000. The disastrous floods in the Elbe and Danube basin in summer 2002, acted as a wake-up call for the National Authorities as well as the European Commission to investigate new strategies for flood prevention and protection, with focus on co-ordinated actions among countries sharing the same river basin. Shortly after the 2002 floods, the European Commission announced in the communication COM(2002)-481 the development of a European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) (http://www.efas.eu). Since then, Europe has been hit by several major flood disasters such as the Elbe and Danube floods in 2006 and the Central European floods in 2010 affecting mostly Poland but also the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia. EFAS is part of a strategy for improved disaster management in Europe to reduce the impact of transnational floods through early warning. First of all, the aim of the system is to provide, useful, complementary and shared information on upcoming flood events to the national hydrological services. Furthermore, EFAS provides a unique and coherent overview on ongoing and forecast floods across Europe, which is needed for improved coordination of international civil protection actions on European scale during severe flood events.  EFAS development steps  1999-2003: Research study,.Kwadijk, J.: EFFS ‚Äì European Flood Forecasting System. Final report of Contract EVG1-CT-1999-00011 (http://effs.wldelft.nl ), 2003.Gouweleeuw, B., Thielen, J., Franchello, G., De Roo, A., Buizza, R.: Flood forecasting using medium-range probabilistic weather prediction. Hydrological and Earth System Sciences, 9(4), 365‚Äì380, 2005. While EFFS was ongoing, Elbe and Danube were struck by widespread and devastating flooding in 2002. Since the hydrological model was set up for EFFS on European scale and the German Weather Service agreed to provide real-time weather forecasting data to the JRC during the event, the EFFS experimental set-up could be used to simulate the ongoing floods and how the flood waves could be expected to travel down the Danube river. 2003: Following the encouraging results of the ad hoc real-time test in 2002, the European Commission launched the development of a fully functioning European Flood Alert System (EFASLater EFAS was renamed to European Flood AWARENESS System). The development was financially supported by the European Commission and the European Parliament. Furthermore, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia detached experts to assist the JRC with the building of such a system. The German Weather Service agreed to continue providing the JRC with historic and real time weather forecasts for setting up and testing of EFAS. 2004: Weather prediction more than a few days in advance is associated with a lot of uncertainty and in particular for rainfalls. In order to capture the possibility for extreme events correctly, ensemble prediction systems have been designed Buizza et al., and multi-model approaches are desirable. Follow discussion (and contribute to the topic) on HEPEX. Therefore, in 2004 a collaboration agreement with ECMWF was signed, allowing the JRC to incorporate also ECMWF ensemble prediction data and its higher resolution deterministic forecast into EFAS in real-time. Technically, in 2004 only the deterministic forecast could be incorporated and the EPS only later in 2005. 2004: EFAS is adopted in the Danube Flood Action Plan. A dedicated EFAS-Danube is being established. 2005: An emerging European system for forecasting floods was viewed critically by the Member States as conflicting information to civil protection from different sources could lead to confusion and thus be counter- productive. Therefore, an EFAS partner network was established with clear dissemination and access rules. EFAS real time information was only to be distributed to partners having agreed to receive the data for testing purposes. EFAS real time information is not to be distributed to the public. EFAS partners were receiving annual training on the products and the system to understand the EFAS concepts, its strengths and weaknesses and were given the opportunity to discuss modifications to the development, visualisation, dissemination etc. During the 2005 Danube Alpine floods, EFAS distributed the first EFAS information reports to the EFAS partners. Since the EFAS network was still patchy, individual reports needed to be drafted for each partner on a daily basis, updates provided etc. EFAS becomes a Hydrological Ensemble Prediction Experiment (HEPEX) testbed. 2007: Following requests from the partners, a dedicated EFAS web-interface was developed which allowed partners to access the data. By 2007 the EFAS partner network covered the majority of the trans-national rivers in continental Europe. Partners have access to EFAS through a dedicated username and password and could browse through the different information layers. Access to EFAS through the interface accelerated the development since more suggestions were put forward by the partner network. 2009: EFAS methodologies, set-up documented as well as first skill scores published.Thielen, J., Bartholmes, J., Ramos, M.H., de Roo, A.

Furthermore, the 16 members of COSMO-LEPS have been integrated in EFAS as a dynamic downscaling of the ECMWF EPS during the first 5 days of leadtime. 2009-2012: During this time the JRC participated in an FP7 project called IMPRINTS on the development of an early warning indicator for flash floods. The results during IMPRINTS were reported regularly to the EFAS partners and eventually adopted for testing by the partner network.Alfieri, L., Salamon, P., Pappenberger, F., Wetterhall, F., Thielen, J., Operational early warning systems for water-related hazards in Europe, 2012, Environmental Science & Policy, 21: 35-49,Alfieri, L., Thielen, J., Pappenberger, F., 2012, Ensemble hydro-meteorological simulation for flash flood early detection in southern Switzerland, Journal of Hydrology, 424‚Äì425, 43‚Äì153 Since 2012, the flash flood layers are part of the EFAS as separate layers. 2010: The EFAS interface was made also available to the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) which has become in 2013 the European Response and Coordination Centre (ERCC). Therefore, during the Central European Floods affecting mostly Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary, the MIC/ERCC was - for the first time - informed ahead in time of the possibility of major upcoming floods in several countries. When Poland activated the European Civil Protection mechanism, the MIC was prepared and could react without delay. The teams onsite could follow online the flood situation with an outlook for the coming days also for the neighbouring countries on one interface displaying comparable information, harmonised colour codes, English language, etc. This was a major step forward for the MIC/ERCC. 2011: EFAS was inserted into the Emergency Management Service of the.Regulation (EU) n¬∞911/2010, ‚ÄúThe European Parliament and the Council on the European Earth monitoring programme (GMES) from 2011 to 2013‚Äù. EFAS is co-financed between DG GROW/COPERNICUS and DG ECHO. 2012: The operational centres start setting up the services. The transfer from the pre- operational system to operations was in October 2012. 2013: First stress test for the operational centres was in June 2013 with the Central European floods. The service worked smoothly throughout the period.  EFAS partners and network  * The EFAS network consists of National Hydrological services and associated partners. Associated partners can be Civil Protection authorities which are associated to their National or Regional Hydrological Service. * International Commission for the Protection of the River Danube (ICPDR). EFAS has been adopted as part of the Danube Flood Action Plan and had developed a stand-alone EFAS-Danube system. However, with the development of the EFAS information system, a dedicated EFAS Danube system became obsolete and has been fully integrated in the operational EFAS-IS. EFAS experts report regularly to ICPDR.  EFAS concepts and tools   Ensemble Prediction Systems ‚Äì key to longer flood warning times  Most hydrological services rely either on observations only or on short-term deterministic rainfall forecasts of up to two days or less because the high degree of uncertainty in weather forecasts at longer lead times. Since these uncertainties are also unpredictable, they render the results unreliable and therefore not useful for decision making. Since the last 10 years, however, the hydrological community is looking increasingly at the use of ensemble prediction systems (EPS) instead of single (deterministic) forecasts for flood warning times beyond 48 hours. EPS have already become an integral part of operational weather forecasts over the past years.Buizza R, Hollingsworth, A, Lalaurette F, Ghelli, A. 1999. Probabilistic Predictions of Precipitation Using the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System. Weather and Forecasting. 14, 168‚Äì189 They are designed to give a measure of the predictability of the weather and uncertainty in the model solution for lead times up to two weeks which would be considered well outside the range of predictability for deterministic models. The trend for implementing hydrological ensemble prediction systems in operational flood forecasting centres can clearly be seen in Europe,.Cloke H., Thielen J., Pappenberger F., Nobert S., Balint G., Edlund C., Koistinen A., de Saint-Aubin C., Sprokkereef E., Viel C., Salamon P., and Buizza R. (2009) Progress in the implementation of Hydrological Ensemble Prediction Systems (HEPS) in Europe for operational flood forecasting ; ECMWF Newsletter, Autumn 2009, 121, 20‚Äì24Cloke, H.L. and Pappenberger, F., 2009. Ensemble Flood Forecasting: A Review. Journal of Hydrology, 375(1‚Äì4): 613‚Äì626, EFAS uses multiple weather forecasts and EPS as input. Its forecasts are based on two deterministic, medium-range forecasts from the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the German Weather Service (DWD), (and thus different models) and on two sets of EPS: One from ECMWF which covers the medium-range up to 15 days globally (with a spatial resolution of ~30 km and 51 members, and one from the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO), a limited area model EPS covering most of Europe with a shorter range up to 5 days (with a spatial resolution of 7 km and 16 members). The reason for using the shorter term EPS is to enhance the spread of EPS within the first few days and to have a finer grid information in particular for mountainous areas. This allows to better identify the location of the floods within the river basin.Thielen J., K. Bogner, F. Pappenberger, M. Kalas, M. del Medico, and de Roo, A., 2009b: Monthly-, medium-, and short-range flood warning: testing the limits of predictability; Meteorol. Appl., 16, 77‚Äì90. In a case study it has been demonstrated that using the eight global medium-range EPS available worldwide can provide a higher reliability for the results,Pappenberger F, Bartholmes J, Thielen J, Cloke, H.L., Buizza R. and de Roo A, 2008: New dimensions in early flood warning across the globe using grand-ensemble weather predictions. Geophysical Research Letters. 35, L10404, . but is computationally intensive.  LISFLOOD ‚Äì the hydrological model for EFAS  The hydrological model used for EFAS is LISFLOOD. The model is a hybrid between a conceptual and a physical rainfall-runoff model combined with a routing module in the river channel. LISFLOOD has been specifically designed for large river catchments.De Roo, A.P.J., Wesseling, C.G. and Van Deursen, W.P.A., 2000, Physically based river basin modelling within a GIS: The LISFLOOD model. Hydrological Processes, 14, pp. 1981‚Äì1992.Van Der Knijff, J. M., Younis, J. and De Roo, A. P. J.(2008) LISFLOOD: a GIS-based distributed model for river basin scale water balance and flood simulation, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 99999:1, A particular feature of LISFLOOD is its strong use of advanced Geographical Information System (GIS), in particular as a dynamic modelling framework.Thielen Del Pozo J, Salamon P, De Roo A. Geographical Information Systems ‚Äì An Integral Part of the European Flood Alert System (EFAS). Geo-Focus (8); 2008. p. 12-16.  Reducing false alarms ‚Äì threshold exceedance and persistence  EFAS is providing information to the national hydrological services only when there is a danger that critical flood levels might be exceeded. In EFAS, the critical thresholds are needed at every grid point and therefore cannot be derived from observations. Instead, based on observed meteorological data, long-term discharge time series are calculated at each grid with the same LISFLOOD model parameterisation that is set up in the forecasting system. From these long- term simulations return periods are estimated ‚Äì currently the 1-, 2-, 5- and 20-year return periods. All flood forecasts are compared against these thresholds ‚Äì at every pixel ‚Äì and the threshold exceedance calculated. Only when critical thresholds are exceeded persistently over several forecasts, information at these locations is produced, e.g. in the form of colour-coded overview maps or time series information at control points. The persistence criteria have been introduced to reduce the number of false alarms and focus on large fluvial floods caused mainly by widespread severe precipitation, combined rainfall with snow-melting or prolonged rainfalls of medium intensity.  Verification  Forecast verification is important to understand the strength and weaknesses of the system and to build confidence in its results. For EFAS two types of verifications are applied. The first one is event-based ‚Äì for each flood alert the hit, false alarm and misses are assessed. If a flood alert has been sent but no flooding was observed, a false alarm is counted. If somewhere in the basin flooding has been report, a hit it counted. If flooding has been reported for which an alert was not sent (even if the system itself simulated an event), a missed event is counted. The events are assessed through feedback reports and media throughout the year and reported during the EFAS annual meeting. In addition to the event-based verification, also skill scores are computed including Brier Skill Score, Root Mean Square Error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, continuous rank probability score, etc. These are reported regularly in the EFAS bulletins and in publications. Skill analysis has been reported for example in,.Bartholmes, J. C., J. Thielen, M. H. Ramos, and S.

Links to other projects and initiatives   HEPEX - the Hydrological Ensemble Prediction Experiment  HEPEX was founded in 2004 with NOAA and ECMWF as co- chairs. It is an international research initiative with the aim to \\"demonstrate the added value of hydrological ensemble predictions (HEPS) for emergency management and water resources sectors to make decisions that have important consequences for economy, public health and safety.\\" HEPEX is organised around six major themes, i) Input and pre-processing, ii) Ensemble techniques and process modelling, iii) Data assimilation, iv) Post-processing, v) Verification and vi) Communication and use in decision making.

HEPEX is holding webinars which can be followed online with the possibility to ask question and participate in the discussion. HEPEXwebinars are transferred for online viewing here.  Global Flood Awareness System  Using similar concepts developed for the continental EFAS, a Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) is being developed in collaboration between ECMWF, the JRC and other contributing research organisations.

He is also the co-founder, along with Dr. K. Varghese, of Institute of Rural Management, Anand. Early life, education Ravi was born to a Syrian Anglican family in Kerala as the son of John Mathai, who served as India's first Railway Minister and subsequently as India's Finance Minister. His cousin is Verghese Kurien. He was educated at The Doon School, Dehradun and later graduated from University of Oxford with Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) in Economics. .http://www.udayindia.org/content_06august2011/bookself.html He began his career at a Calcutta based firm but later moved to the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta in 1963 as Professor of Marketing. Influence on IIM Ahmedabad [IIMA] after leaving IIM Calcutta In 1965 Matthai was invited by noted Indian Institution builder and scientist Dr. Vikram Sarabhai to join IIMA as its first full-time Director. He was 38 years old at the time and did not have an advanced academic degree. Yet, over the next six years, he set the foundations for an institution that was to grow into a top-ranking management school in India. A number of reasons are attributed to Matthai's enduring influence on IIMA: * First, a clear sense of purpose. IIMA's concern, as Mathai put it, was \\"with the application of knowledge\\". This meant that the Institute would be involved in teaching, research and consulting. The impact \\"would be greatest if it were the combined result of all activities\\", so faculty must engage in all three activities. Matthai saw clearly that to focus merely on business would limit IIMA. It would also expose it to charges of being elitist in its orientation. IIMA's ambit needed to be wider: it would be an institute of management, not just a business school. It would develop expertise in important sectors, including agriculture. * Secondly, Matthai's conviction that academic activities can flourish only when faculty are given the fullest freedom. In an academic institution, excellence cannot be ordered. It springs forth when people are given the space to grow and to express themselves freely. * Thirdly, the idea of a faculty-governed institute where decision-making rests primarily with the faculty and not with the director or the board. An example is the admissions committee that is independent of the director. The mechanism has been crucial in insulating admissions from unhealthy influence. * Fourthly, what is, perhaps, Matthai's greatest bequest to IIMA: the principle of a single term for the director. After six years as director, Matthai announced his decision to step down and stay on as professor. He gave two reasons for doing so:first, leaders of academic institutions tended to use their positions for career advancement at an adverse cost to the institutions;secondly, it was important to establish the principle that the director's position is not hierarchical; he is only first among equals, which was characteristically bold of him, given the cultural milieu prevailing in leading academic institutions at that time. The Jawaja Experiment In 1975, a few years after stepping down from IIMA's directorship, Matthai decided to test whether corporate management disciplines could be related to gut issues of Indian poverty. He selected Jawaja block which included about 200 villages with a population of approximately 80,000 people in a drought prone district of Rajasthan. The area was then regarded by the government authorities as devoid of any scope for development. Believing that people were the greatest resource for development, Matthai began to work with village communities on issues of livelihood and empowerment in an environment that was (and still remains) among India's most degraded and oppressive. Volunteers from IIMA and the National Institute of Design (NID) joined with local citizens in the search for livelihood options that could be sustained in the face of social, environmental and political challenges. Among them was Raaj Sah, subsequently Professor at the University of Chicago, who worked on the project during and after his MBA studies at IIMA. Among his contributions were that Ravi Matthai and he together were the first on the ground and, starting from nothing, they began structuring and implementing the work of poverty alleviation. Ravi Matthai (on the chair) and Raaj Sah (with beard and long hair) with villagers in Jawaja, 1975. Languishing skills in weaving and leather work were selected in an effort to develop new opportunities for earning that could be outside the control of local vested interests while remaining rooted in familiar and tested capacities. The Jawaja Experiment thus began with Prof. Ravi Matthai leading a small group of volunteers to what seemed a barren patch of land with little resources and even less hope. Forty years later, the Jawaja Leather Association and the Jawaja Weaver's Association, linked as AAJ, continue their struggle for self- reliance and dignity. They have come a long way. The leather workers and weavers have won a degree of economic independence. Their products are reputed in India and in many parts of the world. This experiential learning of running a gross root development project, led to the setting up of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand. Ravi Mathai, and two of his former IIMA colleagues, Dr.Kamala Chowdhary and Dr.Michael Halse are credited with conceptualising the need for an independent Institute of Rural Management. The institute was established in Anand, at the express invitation of Dr.Verghese Kurien, his cousin, then Chairman of the National Dairy Development Board. Ravi Mathai was associated in the initial years in various capacities - being a member on the Board, directly in teaching students, apart from informally mentoring the faculty. Honors National Institute of Design (NID) at Paldi, Ahmedabad, has a Ravi J Matthai Design Research Chair for \`design innovation for enriching school education, craft sectors and design research\`. It focuses on developing a range of design research related projects and activities in this area. The institute library at the Institute of Rural Management, Anand and the Centre for Educational Innovation at IIM Ahmedabad are named after him. In 1986, IIMA established the Ravi J. Matthai Centre for Educational Innovation (RJMCEI), to conduct research and undertake training activities to influence the management of education systems in India.

It was the group's second album and was recorded at Mobius Music in San Francisco on March 19‚Äì23, 1990. The album was released in 1990 in the United States by Windham Hill Records on CD. The album was reissued in 2008 by Fledg'ling Records with one extra track recorded live. Reception In a review of the album in The Santa Fe New Mexican, Steve Terrell called French Frith Kaiser Thompson \\"the world's most obscure 'supergroup. He says this collaboration is led by Kaiser, with his \\"whacky, ecclectic [sic] approach to rock\\", and Thompson, \\"break[ing] out of his own mold\\" and \\"experimenting with ... sheer craziness\\". Terrell liked the playfulness of Kaiser's \\"The Nearsighted Heron\\" and \\"Days of Our Lives\\", and Thompson's \\"mock opera\\", \\"March of the Cosmetic Surgeons\\". He also liked French's \\"Now That I Am Dead\\", although he was critical of some of French's other songs (\\"Invisible Means\\", \\"The Evening News\\" and \\"Suzanne\\"), which Terrell felt were the \\"low points of the album\\". But overall, Terrell called the album \\"a winner\\", adding that he hoped there was more to come from the group. Mark Deming at AllMusic described Invisible Means as \\"calmer, and a bit easier to digest\\" than their first album, Live, Love, Larf & Loaf, but complained that it \\"lacks ... the playful wit and high spirits\\" of that album. Deming added, however, that there are some \\"intelligent but unexpectedly conventional-sounding pop tunes\\" from French, some good contributions from Kaiser and Frith, and \\"a stunning tune\\", \\"Killing Jar\\" from Thompson.

Hardiker was a product of the academy system at Morecambe where he made his first full appearance at the age of 16. He moved in 2002 for a fee of ¬£150,000 to Stockport County where he famously scored two goals in a historic victory over Manchester City. After making over 100 appearances for Stockport he moved to Bury before returning to Morecambe. Hardiker was then released by Morecambe and spent some time at Fleetwood Town before being snapped up by Jim Harvey by signing a contract at Forest Green Rovers. He had a turbulent 2008‚Äì09 season with Forest Green. He was appointed club captain until being sidelined for 4 months with injury, after which he made a dramatic return scoring twice in a 3‚Äì0 win over Northwich. Shortly after this, in late February 2009 he was suspended by the club over a non-club related matter.Press Statement Regarding John Hardiker Forest Green Rovers, 6 March 2009 In March 2009 Hardiker resigned from his contract with Forest Green following his suspension. On 19 March 2009 it was announced that Hardiker has signed a contract with Conference North side Stalybridge Celtic. In late 2010 he joined Droylsden after the two teams agreed an undisclosed fee. In January 2012, Hardiker left Droylsden and signed for Radcliffe Borough. In May 2012 he signed for Northwich Victoria. He left Northwich in December 2012 however and he joined Warrington Town. Because of postponements over the 2012 festive period, Hardiker failed to make a single appearance for Warrington and left the club to sign for Connah's Quay Nomads in January 2013.

It is Cellan Jones's first feature film. The film was almost entirely shot on location in Shepherd's Bush, West London, where Cellan Jones lives. Plot The film's central character, Ray (Daniel Craig), has schizophrenia. The story begins with Ray's discharge from psychiatric hospital. Ray's devoted brother Pete (David Morrissey) picks him up and drives Ray to his new abode, the spare room in Pete's West London flat. Pete is a chef who works long hours in the caf√© (a traditional \\"greasy spoon\\" during the day and a trendy eatery in the evening) that he inherited from his father. He now has to find the time to take care of Ray and monitor the medication that controls the voices in his head. Ray is an intelligent, out-going young man. He soon falls for Laura (Kelly Macdonald), a Glaswegian girl in the midst of breaking up with her abusive boyfriend (Peter McDonald). Laura becomes attracted to Ray because of his spontaneity and his childlike sense of fun. Around this time, Pete also becomes involved in a relationship with Mandy (Julie Graham). As Ray's relationship blossoms, he begins to resent taking his pills, preferring to trust in the soothing properties of love. Over time, this decision has disastrous effects on all three relationships: the relationship between the brothers, Ray and Laura, and Pete and Mandy. Ray may cause disruption, concern and distress to those close to him but that is only a fraction of the distress his condition causes him. In the end, it is the relationship between the brothers that is central to the film. Pete is long-suffering but, despite all his frustration and resentment, his loving commitment keeps his brother from serious harm.

It was nominated for the Golden Hitchcock Award at the annual Dinard Festival of British Cinema in France. (Billy Elliot won the award that year.) The first-time director was nominated for the Best Newcomer at the British Academy Awards. Critics were divided about Some Voices. Channel 4 called it \\"one of the best British films of 2000\\", with the director's vision of west London's \\"tower blocks, dual-carriageways and crowded streets\\" mirroring the central character's \\"gradual disintegration\\". Mark Wyman of Film Review also recommended Some Voices as a film \\"definitely worth seeing\\" which \\"showcases some terrific British talent\\".\\"The Film Review Year Book 2001\\", London Conversely, Empire called the film, \\"claustrophobic and cornered\\" and claimed that it \\"probably brought the house down on stage, but on film, it's simply static\\". Total Film also had doubts. \\"Perhaps it's the quirky, jerky This Life camerawork or the dim, grainy film stock, but Some Voices never reaches out and grabs the audience, remaining a watch rather than an experience\\". However, the director did \\"draw intelligent, effective turns from his cast ‚Äì Daniel Craig and David Morrissey are excellent, while Kelly Macdonald delivers the kind of sweetly sexy performance she's rapidly trade- marking\\". Special mention was also made of one particular \\"brilliant effect\\". As Ray, Daniel Craig's central character, \\"stops taking his tablets, the strange staticky images start to dominate his vision, the odd sounds begin to blot out reality and, gradually, the gulf between the world he experiences and the one everyone else lives in widens disastrously. It's a clever and mammothly effective technique, communicating not just the strangeness of what's happening to Ray, but also the sheer terror of it\\". Time Out, on the other hand, described this \\"brilliant effect\\" as \\"over-egging it somewhat\\". The \\"whirling camera effects and freaky sound mix overstates the point that our man really is not well\\". Nevertheless, the Time Out reviewer is also complimentary about the acting. \\"Penhall's adaptation of his play remains an actors' showcase. Morrissey skillfully registers abiding filial love tested by simmering exasperation; MacDonald's adept at lippy on top, vulnerable underneath; and Craig's vibrant yet haunted expressiveness tells us everything needful about this doomed sweetheart\\". Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian and Peter Byrne in the Student BMJ are much more unequivocal in their praise. Bradshaw calls the film \\"a serious, substantial, and compassionate movie which demands to be seen, not least for its outstanding performances from an excellent cast\\". Byrne says that Some Voices \\"works as a film, and a technically accomplished one at that\\". Both reviewers particularly commend the film's avoidance of clich√©. Bradshaw stresses that \\"nothing could be more tiresome and dishonest than shop worn RD Laing-style clich√©s about schizophrenia being a heightened visionary state which the western world crushes under the jackboot of its dull rationalist enlightenment. Such a proposition would not correspond to the actual experience of schizophrenia sufferers and their carers; in real life, schizophrenia can lead to a lifelong trial of stress and unhappiness, and Some Voices reflects this\\". He also welcomes the fact that \\"the schizophrenic is not demonised as a potential criminal or as a care-in-the-community basket-case\\", and that \\"Ray's essential humanity is transcribed with sympathy and warmth, and so is the patience and perseverance of Pete, who must shoulder most of the burden of schizophrenia's terrible mystery\\". Byrne writes that \\"the film is refreshing in its avoidance of the standard formulas. Gone are the psycho-killer, pathetic, or 'crazy funny guy' stereotypes‚Ä¶ There is no blaming, no mental illness as metaphor, no psychiatry bashing, and - although a romance lies at its core - there is none of the usual message that 'love is better than tablets.

It is just off the A40 road, between Carmarthen (about 20 miles SW) and Brecon (about 25 miles E). The community is bordered by the communities of Cynwyl Gaeo, Llanwrda, Myddfai, Llangadog, Manordeilo and Salem, and Talley; all of these are in Carmarthenshire. History According to tradition, it was founded by an early Christian saint, Sadwrn (fl. around 460). Four miles to the west of the village are the ruins of Talley Abbey (). One mile to the west is the hamlet of Waunclunda, and above Waunclunda is an ancient fort. Little information is available about this fort, but it is believed to have been an Iron Age and then a Roman fort it is believed to be important for its potential archeology.

Biography He was the only son of the \\"fermier g√©n√©ral\\" Pierre Grimaud du Fort (1692‚Äì1748). In 1766, 18 years after his father's death, he reached his majority and assumed control of his enormous inheritance from his father, making him one of the richest men of his day. Work on the gardens of the family chateau at Orsay, begun by his father and continued by Pierre Gaspard's guardians, including, in 1758, extensive work under the direction of the talented architect Jean-Michel Chevotet (1698‚Äì1772), who had won the Prix de Rome in 1722 and was admitted to the Royal Academy of Architecture in Paris in 1732. When the ambitious garden scheme was completed on 1 August 1764, two years before his majority, an inventory of the d'Orsay family holdings declared: :\\"The greatest artists and a large number of workers have changed the face of nature which was not agreeable near the chateau, and created a park that may be considered one of the most beautiful of the environs of Paris. . .especially for its beautiful plants, terraces, and the large quantities of water distributed via a superb canal and in basins of every form.\\" He acquired in 1768 the hotel de Saissac (now hotel de Clermont), 69 rue de Varenne, Paris. This had been built for Jeanne Therese Pelagie d'Albert de Luynes, marquise de Saissac, in 1708, and Pierre had it rebuilt by Pierre Convers, Jean Augustin Renard et Charles Joaquim Benard, with the old bedroom made into a salon, for example. This phase of the hotel ‚Äì of which nothing remains today ‚Äì constituted an important step in the evolution of the taste, and contributed to his entry into aristocratic circles of the Faubourg Saint- Germain.

He was the son of Pierfrancesco di Lorenzo de' Medici, and therefore a member of a secondary branch of the family. Biography Giovanni was born in Florence. After his father's death (1476), he and his elder brother Lorenzo (il Popolano) came under the tutelage of their cousins Giuliano and Lorenzo (il Magnifico), and were educated by humanists such as Marsilio Ficino and Angelo Poliziano. They conceived a passion for classical studies and books, and later created a large library of manuscripts and codexes. Later their relationship with Lorenzo il Magnifico deteriorated, mostly for economic reasons (Lorenzo had kept for himself the Popolanos' inheritance, instead of simply administering it). After Lorenzo il Magnifico's death, they were among the opponents of Lorenzo's successor, Piero (il Fatuo), who exiled them in April 1494. The following November, Lorenzo and Giovanni returned to Florence in the wake of Charles VIII of France's invasion of Italy, as Piero had been ousted by a Republican revolution in the city.

It was fought on the coast of Mull north of Tobermory, between John MacDonald of Islay, the Lord of the Isles and chief of Clan Donald; and his son, Angus Og Macdonald. The precise date of the battle varies in sources, from 1480 to 1483.Scottish Battles List by Region, Scotland ‚Äì UK History After the battle, in which Angus Og Macdonald emerged victorious, the latter seized power from his father, and held it for a decade. However, Angus's victory would prove pyrrhic. Many clansmen had died in the battle and nearly half the clan's fleet had been sunk, as a result of which the power of the Lords of the Isles was henceforth greatly diminished. Angus, last of the independent Lords of the Isles, would himself be murdered ten years later, in 1490. Background In 1476, James III of Scotland was informed of a secret treaty made by John of Islay with Edward IV of England. James stripped John of his earldom, as well as the sheriffdoms of Nairn and Inverness, and the lordships of Kintyre and Knapdale, but confirmed him with the remainder of his lands and the title Lord of the Isles. The designation of Lord of the Isles, however, was from this point forward to be granted by the crown, rather than self-assumed. And John had lost much more than land and titles; he had lost prestige and standing among his own kin. The Lordship had always depended on territorial expansion to give life to its warrior values; but now that it was contracting, all of the latent tensions came forth, finding expression in the person of Angus √ìg. Angus, according to Hugh Macdonald, ejected John both from the leadership of the clan and from his own home, forcing him to seek shelter under an old boat. John gathered his remaining supporters in an attempt to quash his son's rebellion. John's fleet of galleys met those of Angus sometime in the early 1480s off the coast of Mull to the north-west of the present town of Tobermory, an area ever afterwards to be known as Bloody Bay. The battle John MacDonald of Islay, was supported by men from the Clan MacLean, Clan MacLeod, and Clan MacNeil. He was opposed by his son, Angus Og Macdonald, who was supported by Allan Macruari, chief of the Clan MacDonald of Clanranald, Donald Gallach, chief of the Clan MacDonald of Sleat, and Domhnall Mac Aonghais (Donald Mac Angus), chief of the Clan MacDonald of KeppochNotes MacRuarie ‚Äì McCreary as well as the MacLeods of Lewis. In bitter fighting, Aonghas defeated the galleys of his father's west highland allies. The Bannatyne manuscript states that William Dubh, chief of the MacLeods, was killed early on, and at the fall of their chief, the MacLeods began to give way. However, a priest named Callum Clerich made the keeper of the Fairy Flag unfurl his banner. The manuscript states that when the MacLeod's kinsmen, the MacLeods of Lewis, switched sides upon seeing the sacred flag unfurled and joined the forces supporting John. However, the fate of the battle was already decided and the forces of Angus won the day. A large number of the clan was killed during the conflict, including the bearer of the flag, Murcha Beach, as well as the twelve men who were tasked with the flag's protection. Hector Odhar Maclean, the chief of Clan MacLean and Nick Martin's naval commander, was taken prisoner.Maclean William Dubh MacLeod, chief of Clan MacLeod, was killed along with many of his clan. Aftermath After the battle, Angus Og Macdonald took over power from his father, and held it for a decade until he was murdered. However, many clansmen died, and nearly half the clan's fleet had been sunk. Angus himself would be murdered ten years later. As a result of Bloody Bay and other reverses, the power of the Lords of the Isles would henceforth be greatly diminished.

Elizabeth is the granddaughter of the show's original lead character, Steve Hardy (John Beradino) and daughter of Jeff Webber (Richard Dean Anderson). Introduced on August 1, 1997, as a rebellious teenager, Elizabeth comes to live with her grandmother Audrey Hardy (Rachel Ames) and sister Sarah Webber (Jennifer Sky). Feeling abandoned by her parents, Elizabeth is a wild child with no regard for her life. In 1998, after she is raped, Elizabeth goes from a rebellious teenager to a terrified timid girl. She finds comfort with Lucky Spencer (Jonathan Jackson) and they fall in love. The duo's endearing young love story propels them into supercouple status in the same vain as Lucky's famous parents, Luke and Laura (Anthony Geary and Genie Francis). Elizabeth and Lucky's (then Greg Vaughn) rocky marriages ultimately end in divorce. Their failed reunion in 2009, results in Elizabeth's affair with Lucky's half- brother Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher), and her giving birth to Lucky's son, Aiden. In 2006, in the midst of her chaotic marriage to Lucky, Elizabeth has an affair with her long time friend, mob hitman Jason Morgan (Steve Burton) which leads to the birth of her middle son, Jake whom Lucky initially raises as his own. Jason and Elizabeth would also achieve supercouple status. Currently, Elizabeth is raising her three sons, and his happily married to reformed serial killer Franco Baldwin (Roger Howarth). Having played one of the show's most beloved characters, Herbst has earned three Daytime Emmy Award nominations for her portrayal of Elizabeth, in 1999, 2007 and 2012. The actress and character's popularity were put on full display when she was suddenly fired from the series in 2011; fan backlash forced the network to rehire the actress. Casting Rebecca Herbst originally auditioned for the role of Sarah Webber. Although she did not get the part, General Hospital created the role of Sarah's sister Elizabeth for Herbst to play, and she debuted on August 1, 1997. Rumors circulated about Herbst's departure, starting when her on-screen love interest Jonathan Jackson (Lucky Spencer) left the series in April 1999, continuing through Herbst's contract expiration in the summer of 2000. Herbst re-signed in July for three years. In November, Herbst guest starred along with Jacob Young (then-Lucky Spencer) and Jacklyn Zeman (Bobbie Spencer) on the FOX network sketch comedy series MADtv, making a small cameo as Elizabeth. On January 18, 2011, ABC Daytime announced that Herbst had been let go from General Hospital and her exit would be storyline dictated. After much fan protest, a month after the original announcement, ABC released another statement saying that Herbst would retain her role on the show. Richard M. Simms, executive editor of Soaps In Depth discussed the fans' impact on reversal, stating: In May 2011, it was confirmed that Herbst would take medical leave, due to viral meningitis. The role was temporarily portrayed by actress Martha Madison, known for her role as Belle Black on Days of Our Lives, from June 8‚Äì20, 2011. In March 2012, it was confirmed by Soap Opera Digest that Herbst had renewed her contract to continue performing in her role as Elizabeth. In February 2016, Daytime Confidential reported that contract negotiations between Herbst and the show had reached a stalemate, also that Days of Our Lives has expressed interest in hiring Herbst possibly as the potential replacement for Kate Mansi, who had vacated the role of Abigail Deveraux. One month later in March 2016, it was revealed that Herbst will remain with the show. However, the character took a brief hiatus from the show, facilitating the absence in which Herbst had her contract talks, she briefly departed on April 5, 2016 and made her onscreen return on May 4, 2016. Storylines Elizabeth arrives in August 1997 to stay with her grandmother, Audrey Hardy (Rachel Ames), and her sister, Sarah Webber (then Jennifer Sky). She quickly develops a crush on Lucky Spencer (then Jonathan Jackson), but Lucky is interested in Sarah. On Valentine's Day, Elizabeth is raped and Lucky helps her recover. They become close and eventually fall in love, exchanging vows by themselves. When Lucky is presumed dead, Jason Morgan (then Steve Burton) helps Elizabeth deal with her loss. Lucky is found alive, but pushes away his parents and Elizabeth. It is soon evident he has been brainwashed. In 2001, Lucky proposes to Elizabeth in an effort to fight the mind control, but Helena removes Lucky's memories of love for Elizabeth. Elizabeth fakes her death to help Nikolas Cassadine (then Coltin Scott) prove his loyalty to Helena, and Lucky's visions of Elizabeth help him stop Helena's control. In December, Elizabeth stops their wedding when she realizes Lucky has been unable to regain his love for her. They try to start over but struggle, and Elizabeth breaks up with him after she finds him kissing Sarah.

Aiden is kidnapped by Franco (James Franco) before Lucky finds him. Elizabeth later suspects that Lucky could be Aiden's father, and she runs a DNA test that confirms it. Just as she finds out, though, Jake runs out of the house and gets hit by a car. Jake dies in the hospital, and Elizabeth is heartbroken. She does not share the truth for months, coping with her grief and wanting to let Lucky be happy with his new wife, Siobhan McKenna (Erin Chambers). When Lucky burns down the Spencer house and accidentally injures Siobhan, Elizabeth tells him the truth to stop him from drinking. Though Nikolas does not believe Elizabeth, he returns Aiden to her and Lucky, then leaves town. When Siobhan dies, Elizabeth attempts to reconcile with Lucky, but he refuses and leaves town.

Jason is presumed dead soon after. Meanwhile, Elizabeth helps student nurse Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) plan the resurrection of the Nurses' Ball. When A.J.

They begin to grow closer until Ric returns, alive. Elizabeth and Jake are still drawn to each other until Hayden Barnes (Rebecca Budig) comes to town, and claims \\"Jake\\" is her husband. Elizabeth walks away from \\"Jake\\" and resumes dating Ric. Hayden was actually hired by Ric to pretend to be \\"Jake's\\" wife. At the Nurses Ball, Carly outs Ric's lies, and Elizabeth breaks up with him. When Elizabeth realizes that she should be with \\"Jake\\", Nikolas reveals that \\"Jake\\" is actually Jason.

They become worried when Jake start exhibiting disturbing signs. When Elizabeth's house starts getting vandalized, Jason investigates with Sam's help, who points out to Jason that the vandalism could've been done by someone inside the house.

When they try to get Jake help, he gets hit by a car again and is hospitalized. The doctors, though, are able to save him, and he recovers from his injuries.

Hayden is accused, but is later cleared when it's determined that Elizabeth was actually attacked by Paul Hornsby (Richard Burgi).

Despite her fear of Tom, Elizabeth asks Franco to stay away from Tom for her sake. However, Tom is found dead, and Franco is accused of murdering him. Franco and Elizabeth succeed in getting him exonerated, and focus on their relationship. Meanwhile, Elizabeth grows closer to Hayden when she is diagnosed with a deadly disease, and Elizabeth helps take care of her. Hayden recovers, and when Elizabeth figures out Hayden's boyfriend, Dr. Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton), is an addict, she shares her own experiences with Lucky to help Hayden out. Character development Elizabeth is introduced as the granddaughter of Steve Hardy, one of the original General Hospital core characters. She is the daughter of Jeff Webber and Carolyn (maiden name unknown), and the sister of Sarah Webber and half-sister of Steven Webber. At age fifteen, she arrives in Port Charles in August 1997 to stay with her grandmother, Audrey Hardy (Ames), the stepmother of Jeff. She follows her sister Sarah (then Sky), who had come to live with Audrey a few months prior. Elizabeth and Sarah had grown up in Boulder, Colorado and their parents left the country to work as doctors. Elizabeth is initially characterized as a rebellious teenager, who complains about having to be compared to her perfect sister. Herbst reflected in 1999 on her character's introduction: \\"In the past year she (was) a smart-ass child with no respect for anybody, who was out to get everyone. But that is because she was hurt since her parents pretty much abandoned her. So her frustration, anger and snottiness came from being misguided.\\" Elizabeth's character drastically changes after she is raped in February 1998. Following the assault, she becomes timid and scared, not wanting to leave the house. The teenager's innocence is lost. Lucky (then Jackson) is one of the only people she opens up to, and he helps her to slowly recover. Elizabeth goes through the stages of denial, anger, and eventual acceptance. Although she heals, her character is never the same. Herbst explained in 1999: \\"Ever since her trauma, Liz has matured more and my character has evolved as a result. She's not evil anymore and her growth since I've been on the show makes playing her today give me many challenges as an actor. (...) I think the writers have done a great job in making Liz not a victim but a fighter and showing that, while this was a terrible experience nobody should go through, she will get through this in time and go on with her life.\\" Elizabeth grows in a positive way, and is a stronger person as a result. Soap Opera Weekly stated in November 1998: \\"After the initial shock of the attack wore off, and with support ‚Äì mostly from Lucky ‚Äì the best parts of the 'old' Liz resurfaced: her spirit, her determination, her innate smarts. But for the first time, Liz also showed herself as a person of untapped virtue and considerable substance.\\" Reception and impact Rape The storyline of Elizabeth's rape was initially controversial, but the story of her recovery had a positive reception and received critical acclaim. Victims of abuse stated that the story helped them to heal, and wrote letters of praise to the show. Viewers related to Elizabeth; Herbst stated to Soap Opera Weekly in 1998: Herbst commented to Soap Opera News that she was glad to be helping others, and that the story helped her to be more aware herself as well as better understand the process of recovery. She was seen as a role model to female viewers. The storyline won General Hospital a SHINE Award (Sexual Health IN Entertainment) in 1998. Both Herbst and Jackson received praise for their portrayals throughout Elizabeth's recovery. Herbst received praise for scenes where Elizabeth confronted her suspected rapist and later on when she confronted her actual rapist. Soap Opera Magazine named Herbst Star of the Week in October 1998 when Elizabeth confronted her teacher, mistakenly believing him to be her rapist. Of the latter, Soap Opera News described: \\"We felt each transition in Liz's thoughts and feelings. We felt her fear. Then we felt her anger. Then we felt her take control over the situation. We experienced each experience with her. A television set no longer existed. The audience was in that photo studio, standing beside her, repulsed by this man.\\" Romance Within Herbst's first year on the series, her character entered into a relationship with Lucky Spencer that was soon called a supercouple, compared to Lucky's legendary parents Luke and Laura. Lucky and Elizabeth's romantic relationship took place gradually during Elizabeth's recovery from being raped. Viewers responded positively to the slow pacing, and the couple was perceived as honest and innocent, something unique among soap opera couples at the time. The couple's first kiss happened months into the relationship, and was anticipated and celebrated by fans. The series used the popular teen characters in an attempt to reach young viewers with a social message through Lucky and Elizabeth's decision to abstain from sex. Executive producer at the time Wendy Riche explained her desire to show the decisions and pressures teenagers face, stating to Soap Opera Weekly: \\"We have the opportunity with these beloved characters who have struggled together and who have loved together and who are exploring sexuality together to reach an audience that doesn't really want to be preached to, but wants to feel it.\\" In 2008, Lucky and Elizabeth were named No. 9 by Soaps In Depth of the Top 100 Greatest Couples of ABC Daytime. Elizabeth's relationship with Jason Morgan intertwined with her relationship with Lucky, and although Elizabeth and Jason were never paired on-screen for a long period of time, the couple's fan base was very vocal. They were named by Zap2it to their Top 10 list of couples in 2007, 2008 and 2012. In 2008, they were named No. 12 by Soaps In Depth of the Top 100 Greatest Couples of ABC Daytime. The couple rivaled the supercouple pairing of Jason Morgan and Sam McCall, and in 2007 Zap2it stated, \\"without question Liz vs. Sam is the biggest rivalry in daytime.\\" In 2010, Herbst commented on the fans' impact on the couple: Awards In 1999, Herbst won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Younger Lead Actress, as well as an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Younger Actress. In 2000, Soap Opera Update named Herbst No. 6 on their list of Woman of 2000. Herbst was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2007 and 2012. Elizabeth was named one of the \\"Hottest Nurses on TV\\" by Wet Paint, saying \\"Over the years, Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) suffered the usual ups and downs that come with living in the General Hospital universe. Through it all she managed to hold onto her job (most of the time), and she never lost the sultry beauty that defines all the greatest soap stars.\\" See also * Lucky Spencer and Elizabeth Webber * Jason Morgan and Elizabeth Webber  References   External links  * Elizabeth Webber @ ABC.com * Profile at soapcentral.com * Profile at about.com Category:General Hospital characters Category:General Hospital: Night Shift characters Category:Fictional nurses Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 Category:Fictional artists Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional sexual assault victims Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Elizabeth Webber"},{"id":"11744913","text":"Chocolate Synthesizer is the fourth studio album by Boredoms.

Its central character is the legendary mountain hag, Yama-uba. A female dancer, called \\"Hyakuma Yamanba\\" because of her frequent performances of songs about the character, embarks on a pilgrimage to Zenk≈çji in Shinano Province, accompanied by her attendants. While travelling north-east on the Koshi road, they arrive at the river boundary between Etchu Province and Echigo Province. The road beyond diverges in three directions, and they ask for directions from a local, who advises them that Agero Pass is far too steep for a litter, as it is \\"the path Amida himself takes as he descends to receive souls.\\" The dancer decides that, as she is a pilgrim, it is fitting that she descend from her litter and proceed on foot, taking that very path. They have not gone far when the sun sets unexpectedly, and they are offered lodgings by a mysterious old woman, who, after they accept, demands that the dancer perform the Yamanba song. The attendants are indignant, but become afraid when they realise she is a supernatural being. Suddenly the darkness vanishes, and it is once again the middle of day. They meet the same local man, who tells them tall tales of the origin of Yama-uba. On his departure, the dancer dares not refuse Yama-uba's request -- but it is the crone herself who performs the long dance which ends the play. References *Karen Brazell, ed.

He was born on July 13, 1920 in Battle Creek, Michigan. Ralke died on January 26, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Education Ralke received his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from the University of Southern California, graduating with honors. He also studied with famed composer and Hollywood emigre, Arnold Schoenberg. Career overview On the bongos Ralke collaborated with versatile flute and reed instrumentalist, Buddy Collette on \\"Jazz Heat\\", \\"Bongo Beat\\". Warner Bros. hired him for \\"Gershwin with Bongoes\\" and \\"The Savage and The Sensuous \\", which is widely regarded as one of the best jungle exotica albums of that era. He worked with Warren Barker on the music for 77 Sunset Strip and did the heavy musical lifting when Edd \\"Kookie\\" Byrnes, one of the show's stars, became a teen idol and recorded his one hit, \\"Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)\\". Ralke performed similar duties for \\"Hawaiian Eye\\" star Connie Stevens when she recorded \\"Sixteen Reasons\\". Other recordings include Jewel Akens' \\"The Birds and the Bees\\", and five other gold records. His orchestra backed Sam Cooke on several 1959-1960 songs. Ralke also recorded two hits by Ty Wagner: \\"I'm a No Count\\" as well as \\"Slander\\". In the late 1960s he created his own record company. He collaborated with sound engineer Brad Miller on the hugely successful strings-with-environmental sounds creation, the Mystic Moods Orchestra. Golden Throats Working with \\"Golden Throats talent\\" became a specialty niche for Ralke. Ralke is credited for convincing non-singers including William Shatner and Lorne Greene to play it safe and stick to narration over a musical background. Ralke also produced Beach Boys dad Murry Wilson's The Many Moods of Murray Wilson which was not kindly lauded by critics but nonetheless has achieved a place as an important footnote in 1960s music. Snoopy, Come Home In 1972 Ralke produced and orchestrated Bob and Dick Sherman's Grammy nominated musical film Snoopy, Come Home. Happy Days/Laverne and Shirley In the 1970s, he returned to television, working for producer Garry Marshall on the series \\"Happy Days\\" and its spin-off, \\"Laverne and Shirley\\".

Early life and education Ronald Lee was born in Montreal, Canada in 1934. Lee's father was a Kalderash musician from Europe who immigrated to Canada, where he married and took his wife's surname of Lee. In 1939, his family went to Great Britain on a visit but were unable to return to Canada for several years because of the outbreak of World War II. The Lees eventually returned to Canada in 1945. After returning to Canada, Lee worked during the summer with his uncle for the fairs and amusement parks. In the fall, winter, and spring seasons, he attended night school in Montreal in the 1950s and 1960s. When Lee was 18, he started to travel with a Kalderash family from Europe and worked on plating mixing bowls and doing other smithing arts and odd jobs. Later, he took courses in journalism and creative writing. Adult years Lee began to work with the Canadian Roma as an activist in 1965, through the Kris Romani (Romani internal judicial assembly). He tried to foster a better understanding between Roma and non-Roma, to combat prejudice and misinformation in newspapers, and to help the Roma represent themselves. In the 1970s, he got involved in helping the Romani refugees from the Communist Eastern Bloc and ex-Yugoslavia. He went with Yul Brynner, Ian Hancock and John Tene to the United Nations on July 5, 1978 to present a Romani petition asking for NGO status. This was granted a year later. From 1989‚Äì1990, he helped those seeking asylum who had been persecuted as Roma in their former countries. In 1997, he initiated and was one of the founders of Roma Community and Advocacy Centre (based in Toronto) and the Western Canadian Romani Alliance, in Vancouver, in 1998. Ronald Lee taught a course on the Romani Diaspora at the University of Toronto from 2003 - 2008. In 2014, Ronald Lee was honoured by Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, with an Honourary Doctorate of Laws.

Designed by Milton Pflueger in 1956, Florence Moore Hall was initially a women's dormitory. The dorm made headlines for its cost of $2.6 million, of which $1 million was donated by Florence Moore (two other smaller nearby student houses are named after her husband, Robert S. Moore). The hall consists of seven three-story buildings, Alondra, Cardenal, Faisan, Gavilan, Loro, Mirlo, and Paloma (all Spanish names for birds), organized around a cafeteria, courtyard, and central offices. In addition to being connected on the first floor by the cafeteria, the seven buildings were once connected by a network of catwalks. They were removed during renovation in the summer of 2013. Over the years, Florence Moore has flipped back and forth from having some all-female buildings and some all-male buildings, but as of 2016, all seven are co-ed. Alondra is a freshmen-only dorm, while Cardenal, Faisan, Gavilan, Loro, and Paloma are four-class. Mirlo is all upperclassmen.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 23. is a village close to the River Loughor (Welsh-Afon Llwchwr) in Carmarthenshire (Sir Gaerfyrddin), Wales (Cymru). It also forms an electoral ward for the purposes of elections to Carmarthenshire County Council, and is situated in Berwig Hamlet. It borders with the villages of Llwynhendy, Bryn, Pen-y-graig and Loughor (Cas-Llwchwr). History Bynea was originally the grassing lands for the Romans, who built their fort in Loughor(Casllwchwr). The Yspitty area of Bynea was also a port for the ferry crossing of the River Loughor(Afon Llwchwr). It wasn't until the middle of the 19th century when the first Loughor Bridge was built that the Banc Y Spitty port was closed and the ferry from Loughor to Bynea out of use. Bynea was the name given to the areas east of the village centre and the lands used by the Romans. Where the old and central part of the village today, was originally called Cwm-Felin (mill- valley).This is still visible by the fact of the Cwmfelin Road running through Bynea to nearby Llwynhendy. It was called this after the mill that is still visible today from Heol Saron. This was an agricultural area until the turn of the twentieth century, when it became heavily industralised with coal mines and steelworks. Bynea runs into the village of Llwynhendy, and between the two there are four places of worship, and a number of pubs. Welsh language The Welsh language is spoken by over half the village's population. Bynea is part of the Llanelli Rural community, where 56% of people speak Welsh. Additional information Terry Davies, the rugby union player, is from this area and Kel Coslett the Rugby League legend was born there and still is of residence in the village. The village is served by Bynea railway station with trains operating to Swansea to the south and Shrewsbury to the north. In 1997 the Bynea District Forum was formed with the aim of protecting and promoting the community, its heritage and residents. The forum covers the village itself as well as the communities of Pen-y-graig, Bryn and parts of Llwynhendy it has fought off many unwanted developments and incursions by groups of travellers. In 2017 after 20 years of loyal service the original officers of the forum retired and a new set of officers was elected to carry the work forward.

Rakkha was born in Tavua and went to India to study medicine. He returned to Fiji after fourteen years and established a practice in Ba.

Davendra Singh, a virtually unknown small businessman, managed to persuade the NFP Youth Wing, which had earlier been shunned by Koya, to support him to oppose Rakkha. Singh demanded that a local person be selected by NFP for the vacant seat but when he was ignored by the Party, he nominated himself for the election. The result was a narrow win for Singh by 2209 votes to Rakkha's 2196 votes in an election in which only 4421 of the 12,260 registered voters cast their votes.

This is to be contrasted with an Armenian legend, which claims that the king of the Medes, Azhdahak (Astyages) dreamed that Tigranes would come to attack him and so plotted to bring about his downfall. War commenced and Tigranes killed Azhdahak and then married his widowed wife Anush (Aryenis).

The latter once decided to organize a tournament in which the participants were to drink ten cups of wine before shooting.

According to Rapp,Sleeve notes to CD reissue of Familiar Songs Reprise wanted to issue an album of the best songs from his Pearls Before Swine recordings, and he went into Brooks Arthur's 914 Studios in New York City, with musicians Robbie Merkin (piano), David Wolfert (guitar) and Morrie Brown (bass), to work up ideas for re-recording some of the songs in a new way. Although some of the ideas succeeded, he felt that others needed more work, and the album was put on hold. However, his manager, who (rather than Rapp himself) held the contract with Reprise, passed the tapes to the record company, and later disappeared. Rapp only discovered that the record had been issued when he came upon it in a record store. Not surprisingly, he subsequently disowned the album, but was actively involved when it was reissued on CD in 2004. The album eschews the atmospheric, sometimes psychedelic, arrangements of the Pearls Before Swine records for a more orthodox rock sound. It contains two songs, \\"Grace Street\\" and \\"Charley And The Lady\\", not available elsewhere. Although most critics have disregarded the album because of its contentious origins, Rapp himself has commented favourably on the quality of the musicianship and on some of the song treatments.

It is the fourth novel of the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series. Plot summary It is one of those black days that afflict Montalbano, who is abetted when the weather is bad and becomes intractable. The day is actually already set to be a bad one because the inspector will have to go to the funeral of the Commissioner's wife. Montalbano is also worried about the fact that he'll be accompanied to the funeral by the agent Gallo, an insanely crazy driver. Soon the bad omens come true: on the way to a country road at insane speed, at least according to the inspector who loves walking at a crawl, Gallo invests what seems to be a suicidal chicken, making the car skid and hit another car parked in front of a villa. The inspector, cursing, decides to put himself personally to the guide after having left a note under the windshield wiper of the damaged car to warn the owner. Since Gallo complains about the blow he has received, Montalbano deviates for the hospital where the two spend the entire morning between exams and counter-examinations. On the way back - it has now become too late for the funeral ceremony - the inspector notices that the damaged car has remained where he left it with the ticket still in the windshield wiper. Montalbano finds the matter quite strange and broods the fact over the whole day until, after concluding the bad day with a stormy phone call with his girlfriend Livia, unable to fall asleep, he gets up in the middle of the night and ventures to find out what's inside the villa. Finding the damaged car still where it was in the morning, with burglar art it forces the door of the villa which has signs of being inhabited but appears deserted. He wanders through the various rooms until in a bedroom a gruesome scene appears in the eyes of the inspector: a young woman, blonde and beautiful, completely naked, lays dead in her bed.

He has been a member of hard rock groups, The Angels (1988) and The Screaming Jets (1994‚Äì97, 2010‚Äìpresent). As a solo artist he has fronted various backing bands playing hard rock, electric and acoustic blues by providing lead guitar, vocals, mandolin and keyboards. In 2005 he won the Solo/Duo category at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee.  Biography  James Kevin Hocking, was born on 7 June 1963 and grew up in Melbourne. His father, Kevin Hocking, was a pianist, musical director and composer who worked in TV and theatre; while his mother was a singer. Kevin taught his son to play piano who showed little interest in it. After Hocking was given an acoustic guitar as a Christmas present, he became a self-taught guitarist. He later worked in amateur theatre. Hocking started performing in groups in Melbourne in 1983. In the following year he formed The Astroboys alongside Peter German (ex-Phantom Band) on bass guitar and vocals, Glen Miles, and Christian Muehlke on drums. He composed and performed the theme for ABC-TV telemovie, Emerging in 1985; and provided guitar session work for the network's series, The D-Generation, in the next year. When performing in cafes Hocking would change his description on the \\"Who's Playing Board\\", he related \\"I started to add silly titles (like) Jimi the Singer, Jimi the Muso ... Eventually I wrote Jimi the Human, a joke about playing any style\\". Early in 1986 Hocking, on lead vocals and lead guitar, and German formed The Astr√∂s as a hard rock group with Greg Pedley (ex-Phantom Band) on drums. Hocking also worked on TV series Fame and Misfortune during that year. Also in 1986 The Astr√∂s released a self-titled four-track extended play on Robot Records. It had been recorded live-in-the-studio at Working Class Studios in May. In the next year Hocking, German and Pedley performed as The Housewarmers, however by August The Astr√∂s had reconvened and they toured nationally. They were described by The Canberra Times as a \\"hard rocking Melbourne band, [which] are ready to rocket on to the Australian music scene\\". In May 1988 The Angels' lead guitarist, Bob Spencer, broke his wrist after an on stage collision with front man, Doc Neeson. The group asked Hocking to temporarily replace Spencer for the remainder of the group's Live Line Tour of Australia. Hocking provided lead guitar and backing vocals. He later recalled \\"I was called up as the result of some session work I had recently done ... It was originally to fill in for one night and the tour would be cancelled ... The gig went so well, that the band offered me the guitar spot for the rest of the tour, so overnight I found myself on a major rock tour\\". In the following year he formed Jimi the Human and Spectre 7, another hard rock group, with former bandmate Muehlke on drums (ex-Honeythieves); they were joined by Josie Jason (ca. 1962‚Äì2011) on rhythm guitar and vocals (ex-Butterfly, Final Outcome, Dirty Rats, Mars Needs Women); and Didi Kies on bass guitar (ex-Adventure, Honeythieves). The group signed with Avenue Records which was distributed by EMI. They released their debut album, No Turning Back, in March 1990, which was produced by Peter Blyton (Lime Spiders, The Radiators, Painters and Dockers). It provided two singles, \\"Quicksand\\" and \\"Edge of Insanity\\". Jason left to form her own band, while Jimi the Human and Spectre 7 sold an album, The Official Bootleg in 1991, at gigs and via mail orders. The group's next album, Living in Luxury, appeared in 1993 on the Primitive Records label. Later that year he relocated to Sydney. In January of the following year Hocking joined The Screaming Jets replacing founder, Richard Lara. He appeared on two of their studio albums, The Screaming Jets (August 1995) and World Gone Crazy (October 1997), but had left in May 1997. While a member of that band Hocking also issued an acoustic solo album, The Ultimate Bootleg, in August 1996 on Feral Records and Blah Blah Blah Records. After leaving the group he returned to Melbourne, as a solo artist he fronted Jimi Hocking and The Human Condition. They recorded his next album, The Great B-Grade Remake, which appeared in late 1997 on Blah Blah Blah. Also in 1997, under the name of Jimi Hocking & The Astr√∂s, he released Space Doubt, which contained nine tracks recorded in the mid-1980s and all four tracks from the 1986 EP by the latter named group. Another solo album, Standard Bohemian, followed in March 1998 on Blah Blah Blah, which is an acoustic music-based release. Blue Guitar was issued in 1999 as his first Blues-based album. In June 2012 he told Michael Limnios of Keep the Blues Alive website \\"I had always heard blues music as I grew up with musical parents, but I started to take it more seriously in the early 1980s when I saw SRV perform ... [then] about 15 years ago, the blues festivals became a lot more viable in Australia, so I put together a blues band\\". As of February 2002 Jimi Hocking's Blues Machine included Graham Maddicks on drums and Karl Willebrant on bass guitar. In October 2004 he won the local Melbourne Blues Appreciation Society's Blues Performer of the Year which resulted in an appearance at the 2005 International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee; where he won the Solo/Duo category. In 2010 he rejoined The Screaming Jets replacing his successor, Ismet \\"Izzy\\" Osmanovic, who had left in the previous October. He also continued his solo performances and with his Blues Machine.

She was part of the Ceres group of the C-class of cruisers. Early career and wartime service Coventry was initially going to be called HMS Corsair. She was laid down on 4 August 1916, launched 6 July 1917 and completed for naval service in February 1918. HMS Coventry was in the 5th Light Cruiser squadron from February 1918 till May 1919, and served in the Baltic in this time. Commissioned with the pennant (D43) in May 1919 she was accepted into the Atlantic fleet, until in 1920 when HMS Coventry became the HQ ship for naval Inter allied Disarmament Commission. She went into refit in late 1920 and once the refit was completed she joined the 2nd Light cruiser squadron and she became flagship to the Rear-Admiral [D], Mediterranean Fleet Andrew Cunningham. A torpedo explosion while in Gibraltar in March 1923 caused the death of two of her crew, Chief Stoker Burt and ERA Jackson. In 1935, Coventry went into Portsmouth Dockyard to be refitted as an anti-aircraft cruiser. This refit involved the removal of her 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes, and the fitting of 10 QF 4-inch Mk V guns on single high-angle mountings and 2 octuple-mounted QF 40mm 'pom-pom' autocannon. The 12-pounder AA guns were retained. At the outbreak of World War II HMS Coventry was serving with the Home Fleet between 1939 and 1940, and was damaged on 1 January 1940 in a German air attack on the Shetland Islands, north of Scotland. She was assigned to the Mediterranean fleet in 1940, and was torpedoed and damaged by the Italian submarine Neghelli in the eastern Mediterranean. Coventry also participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento.A Sailor's Odyssey , the Autobiography of R/A Cunningham.

The Coventry had gone to the assistance of hospital ship Aba, which was being attacked by German dive-bombers. When the enemy engaged Coventry, raking her with machine-gun fire, Petty Officer Sephton was mortally wounded, a bullet actually passing through his body and injuring an able seaman beside him. Although in great pain and partially blinded, he stuck to his instruments and carried out his duties until the attack was over. He died of his injuries next day. Petty Officer Sephton was buried at sea. His VC was on display at Coventry Cathedral but was stolen on 25 September 1990.

He is said to have been ordained by Lord Bhavanishankar (') in 1708 to guide the Chitrapur Saraswat community. Swami Parijnanashram I was a Sanyasi who was a Kashmiri SƒÅraswat Brahmin. Lord Bhavanishankar asked him in a dream to go to the banks of a kotiteerth (water tank) in Gokarn to lead the Chitrapur Saraswat community, which was facing an official decree from the King of Nagar imposing penalties unless the Saraswats showed him their guru. Swami Parijnanashram I was renowned as a man of great spiritual grace, and was a scholar in the Sanskrit scriptures and the Vedanta. He established the community's first matha, at Gokarn. He was succeeded by his shishya (≈õi.≈õya; disciple), Shankarashram (). Parijnanashram I died in 1720. His shrine is located at Bhandikere in Gokarn, beside the Uma Maheshwar temple.  Before Parijnanashram I  After the Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin migration from the north, the Saraswats had taken up prestigious administrative posts in the kingdom of Nagar (part of present day Kanara), being regarded as more intelligent and efficient than the other people of the region. This caused jealousy, and led to complaints to the king that the Saraswats had no guru, and hence no independent spiritual existence. In response, the king issued a decree stating that unless the community presented their guru heavy penalties would be imposed on them. This included evicting them from their administrative posts. The community elders, in despair, prayed to Lord Mahabaleshwar (') at Gokarn. They had a dream that a sanyasi would appear on the banks of the Kotiteerth, the temple tank, the following day.  Swamiji Arrives  At the appointed day and hour, a saffron- robed sanyasi with ash smeared on his forehead appeared on the banks of the Kotiteerth. A Kashmiri Saraswat Brahmin, he carried an idol of Lord Bhavanishankar in his cloth pouch, and had come guided by Lord Bhavanishankar in a dream. The sight of this saint bearing the idol of their Kuladevata (Ku.la De.va.ta) (the tutelary deity of the community) was met with joy. The sanyasi was formally ordained as Swami Parijnanashram at the Sri Vishveshvar Vitthal (') Temple at Gokarn, in 1708. This marked the start of the guru lineage, or Guru Parampara, of the Chitrapur Saraswats. The people of the community wrote to the King of Nagar announcing their new guru. The Chitrapur Saraswat community's Chikarmane () clan built a monument, the Belli Mantap (\\"Belli Hall, or Temple\\"), at the place where the community met Swami Parijnanashram at the Kotiteerth in Gokarn.  Shringeri  The King of Nagar, unconvinced, asked the Saraswats to have their guru, or Mathadhipati, approved by the Jagadguru Shankaracharya, the head of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, which is the Shringeri matha. This caused consternation, as the Shankaracharya followers had been hostile towards the Saraswat community. Swami Parijnanashram received the order calmly, and travelled from Gokarn to Shringeri to meet with the Shankaracharya. When the people of Shringeri locked the doors of the temple of the goddess Sharadamba () on his arrival, the swamiji stood at the doorstep and prayed. The intensity of these prayers is said to have sparked a vision by the Jagadguru Shankaracharya of the goddess Sharadamba's annoyance at the callousness of the temple officials. When the Shankaracharya went to the temple, he saw that the idol had lost its lustre. The Shankaracharya called Swami Parijnanashram into the temple, where they talked. The Jagadguru Shankaracharya was impressed by Swami Parijnanashram's detailed knowledge of the scriptures, his mysticism, and his yogic abilities. He gave his consent by offering Swami Parijnanashram the symbols of a MathƒÅdhipati: the Adda Palaki (; a palanquin), Birdu, and BavƒÅli. The Jagadguru Shankaracharya letter of consent officially proclaimed Swami Parijnanashram the Guru of the Saraswats. The king of Nagar was informed, and rushed to greet Swami Parijnanashram. He apologized profusely for having questioned his authority, by falling at his feet. Swami Parijnanashramji is said to have maintained the same calm when the community was in despair and when he was celebrated by the king with honours and festivities. After the king had accepted the Saraswat community's guru, the decree was repealed.  Adi-matha  Once the crisis was resolved, Swamiji wanted to return to his sannyasa, or ascetic life. But his devotees wanted him to remain, and after much pleading he graciously consented. Swami Parijnanashramji took up residence at the Sri Vishveshvar Vitthal Temple at Gokarn, where he performed his AnushthƒÅn (ceremony of foundation). The temple became known as the Adi- matha, or first community monastery, of the Chitrapur Saraswat community.  Shishya Sweekar (\\"Accepting a Disciple\\")  As the community wanted the Guru parampara to continue, the devotees asked the ageing Swami Parijnanashram to accept a shishya ('), or disciple, to succeed him as MathƒÅdhipati. The guruji responded by accepting a shishya, so allaying the community's concerns. That disciple was the son of Krishna Kulkarni of the HaritekƒÅr family. His shishya sweekar, or acceptance ceremony, was performed on the day of Shudha Poornima (≈öu.dha P≈´r.ni.ma) in the month of Chaitra, 1720. Swami Parijnanashram ordained his new shishya as Shankarashram ().  Death  With the news of Swami Parijnanashram's failing health over time, devotees came from far afield for Darshan (to see the Swami), and to receive his blessings. The swamiji died in 1720, on the day of Krishna Chaturdashi in the month of Chaitra, just 14 days after accepting Shankarashram as his disciple. Swami Parijnanashram's last words to his disciple ShankarƒÅshram were (translated to English from Konkani): \\"Lead the devotees on the spiritual path and unto the Lord's grace. Lord BhavƒÅnishankar will always protect you when you face obstacles\\". Param Poojya Swami Shankarashram I was then ordained as the next MathƒÅdhipati.

It is the fifth novel in the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series. In 2006 it was shortlisted for the CWA Duncan Lawrie International Dagger for best translated crime novel of the year. Plot summary The story takes place between Vig√†ta and picturesque site of Tindari, a promontory of historical and archaeological beauty. Montalbano is investigating the mysterious bond that unites three unrelated people in the same violent death. Thanks to his unique professional insight, and perhaps even more to his feelings as a sensitive man, Montalbano successfully concludes the investigation, moving inbetween the boundaries set by the world of tradition and that of modernity. In his fifties, examining his life and a future that seems to be saturated with senseless technology and hopeless inhumanity, with corruption and globalisation rendering everything shapeless, Montalbano feels out of place and lonely.

Created by head writer Margaret DePriest, the role of Carrie has been most notably portrayed by Christie Clark, who took over the role in 1986 as a teenager. Clark remained with the series from 1986 to 1999. She returned in 2005, leaving in October 2006, and returned in September 2011 as part of a reboot of the series. Her return was short lived as she left the show the following July. On September 15, 2016, it was announced that Clark would again reprise her portrayal as Carrie in 2017. Carrie, a lawyer, also returned for several weeks in early 2018 when her mother Anna was accused of the murder of Andre DiMera. She returned in June 2019 for the passing of Caroline Brady (Peggy McCay). Throughout the show, Carrie has been involved in classic soap opera storylines. Her romantic pairing with Austin Reed (Austin Peck; Patrick Muldoon) led them to be labeled a supercouple. She is the daughter of Anna DiMera (Leann Hunley) and Roman Brady (at the time Wayne Northrop, later Josh Taylor), though as a child she was mainly raised by her step-parents, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) and John Black (Drake Hogestyn). Carrie is a member of the Brady family, one of the show's two core families. She has a long-standing rivalry with her sister Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney), as Sami has routinely tried to steal Austin from Carrie. In 2011, Carrie and Sami started to get along better, but their closeness fell apart when Carrie fell in love with Sami's then-husband, Rafe Hernandez, in 2012. The affection was returned by Rafe. Clark's portrayal of Carrie has garnered attention for Clark who was nominated for Outstanding Younger Actress at the Daytime Emmy's in 1997, and again nominated in 1998. She won a Soap Opera Digest Award with co-star Austin Peck for Hottest Romance in 1997. She was also nominated for Best Young Actress in a Daytime Drama at the Young Artist Awards in 1990, and Nominated for Best Young Actress in a Daytime Drama at the Young Artist Awards in 1989. Casting and creation The role of Carrie was originated by child actress Andrea Barber from August 4, 1982 to March 21, 1986. She was succeeded by Clark, who was only twelve years old at the time, on April 14, 1986. Clark remained with the serial until January 14, 1991, when producers wanted to age the character. She went on to appear on other shows such as General Hospital, and appeared in movies such as A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. Meanwhile, the show briefly re-cast Carrie with actress Tracy Middendorf from January 10, 1992 to December 14, 1992. Producers asked Clark to return on December 18, 1992. In June 1999, it was reported by Soap Opera Digest that Clark would exit that fall, and she left on November 19, 1999. In 2005, it was announced that Carrie and Austin would return to the series. Austin, played by Austin Peck returned in July 2005 while Clark reprised the role as Carrie on December 2, 2005. Clark left the show a year later on October 26, 2006. The matriarch of the show, Alice Horton (Frances Reid), died in 2010. The show planned a two-week tribute and brought back longtime fan favorites to the show to pay their respects. Clark was included in the tribute and returned from June 23 to 28, 2010 as Carrie. She popped up again on a phone call with Sami on February 9, 2011. In 2011, it was announced that Carrie and Austin (Austin played by Patrick Muldoon) and several other characters would return permanently. Clark and Muldoon appeared on September 26, 2011. Their return was brought about to please fans and in an attempt to lure old fans of the show back. They remained with the show for less than a year as producers again were re-directing the show. Carrie and Austin last aired on July 24, 2012. On September 15, 2016, it was announced that Clark would return as Carrie, alongside Peck as Austin, on January 11, 2017.

Storylines 1982‚Äì1999 Carrie is the daughter of Roman Brady and Anna Fredericks. Her mother leaves Roman while pregnant with Carrie; Roman doesn't know his daughter exists until Anna returns with a four-year-old Carrie and leaves the girl in her father's and Marlena's care. As a child, Carrie is at one point kidnapped and held captive by Stefano DiMera, who has kidnapped many members of the Brady family at various points. She also nearly drowns during a storm and falls into a coma after a car crash. When Austin Reed moved to Salem in July 1992, Carrie is attracted to him and also becomes the roommate and close friend of Austin's sister, Billie Reed. Carrie and Austin begin dating, but Sami's interfering and Austin's career as a prizefighter causes some strain in their relationship. Carrie becomes a finalist in Bella magazine's \\"Face of the 90‚Äôs\\" modeling competition. In December 1992, when Austin fails to throw a fight, Carrie accidentally becomes the victim of an acid attack that was intended for Austin. The incident causes serious scarring to her face. Her father Roman, who does not like Austin, tells Carrie that if she would break up with him, he will not pursue any charges against Austin stemming from his involvement with the underworld of boxing. Carrie also feels that Austin will no longer love her, due to her scars. As a result of both factors, Carrie pushes Austin out of her life. This gives her sister Sami, who was attracted to Austin, an opportunity to pursue a relationship with him. Sami Brady teams up with Lucas Roberts. Lucas is Austin's half-brother. Lucas is attracted to Carrie and Sami is attracted to Austin. Sami and Lucas scheme to keep Carrie and Austin from reuniting, so Lucas can be with Carrie and Sami can be with Austin. Meanwhile, Carrie has successful plastic surgery on her face and is willing to give her relationship with Austin another chance. During a romantic ski weekend in February 1994, Carrie loses her virginity to Austin, after almost being raped by Sami's boyfriend Alan, who goes on to rape Sami instead. Although Carrie and Austin are a couple, Sami continues to try to break them up and pursue Austin herself. Sami even twistedly blames Carrie for the rape Sami suffered from Alan. In March 1995, Sami drugs Austin and in his delusional state, he believes Carrie is there with him (although it's Sami) and Sami sleeps with him. Nevertheless, Carrie and Austin eventually stay together and begin planning their wedding. Sami is able to stop the ceremony by revealing that she is pregnant with Austin‚Äôs child. At the time, Sami believes that Austin was the father, but she later learns that Lucas was the true father. When she finds this out, she continues to conceal the truth from everyone, even Lucas, for several years. Since Austin believes the baby is his, he feels he had no choice but to build a life with Sami and baby Will instead of marrying Carrie. However, Austin continues to be in love with Carrie. Unfortunately, the kidnapping of Will by Sami's deranged neighbor caused a situation where Sami and Austin, in order to regain custody of Will from the French couple to whom he had been sold, are forced to marry in France to satisfy the authorities there. Carrie, meanwhile, becomes good friends with Dr. Mike Horton. She also uncovered information that Austin is not Will's father. When Austin and Sami plan to wed in America, this time Carrie is able to interrupt the wedding ceremony by revealing that Lucas, not Austin, is Will's father, and that Sami knew it all along. Austin marries Carrie instead. Some time later, Austin becomes increasingly concerned about baby Will's well- being as Will's father Lucas has a drinking problem. Austin begins spending more time around Will, which means more time around Sami; much to Sami's delight and Carrie's dismay. With Austin not being home as much as he spends time with Will, Carrie begins working more hours at the hospital in which she is employed. Over time, Dr Mike Horton develops feelings for her and they slowly grow closer together. Carrie and Mike eventually have an affair, and Austin and Carrie divorce. Austin leaves Salem. Carrie doesn't accept Mike's marriage proposal, but they do move to Israel together. 2005‚Äì2006 A few years later, Carrie returns to the U.S. and settles in Los Angeles where she is CEO of a company called High Style. Carrie tells no one she is back in America but she is discovered by Lucas, who was attempting to take over High Style, not knowing it was headed by Carrie. He halts his takeover attempt and convinces Carrie to return to Salem as his feelings for her are reignited. Carrie returns to town and is surprised to see Austin in Salem as well. Although things look positive for Austin and Carrie's future, her sister Sami sees otherwise and, once again, schemes to break them apart and keep Austin for herself. First she is able to have Austin and his company buy out Carrie's company High Style, Austin not being aware that Carrie has any association with the small business. Carrie, feeling betrayed that Austin took over her company, grows closer to Austin's half brother Lucas. Sami, meanwhile, catches Dr. Lexie Carver having an affair with detective Tek Kramer. To ensure that Carrie will no longer want to be with Austin, Sami threatens to tell Lexie's husband Abe about Tek, unless Lexie helps her. Doctor Lexie Carver is blackmailed into telling Carrie untrue information: that Austin and Carrie both share very rare genetic markers and if they ever had children, the child will suffer extreme birth defects that could result in the baby's death. Due to this bogus news from Lexie, Carrie decides it's best to move on with Lucas. Since she and Austin could never have children, she becomes engaged to Lucas. She soon believes she is pregnant thanks to a false pregnancy test, leading her and Lucas to rush their wedding date. Carrie finds out she is actually not pregnant and still has feelings for Austin. Carrie and Austin make love on the roof of their apartment building, although Carrie is engaged to Lucas and Austin is engaged to Sami. Austin does not marry Sami and Carrie shows signs of relief. Prior to the ceremony, Carrie expresses to Marlena that she is still in love with Austin. Although she cares about Lucas, she is not in love with him. After she secretly meets with Austin on the roof of their building to make love, Lucas, with the help of new neighbor E.J., catches them. After a bitter tirade from Lucas, Carrie is kicked out of the apartment she and Lucas share. Soon after, Carrie hands Lucas annulment papers and he signs them. However, minutes later, the Gloved Hand slides a note under Sami's apartment door, and Lucas, Carrie, and Austin discover the truth behind Sami's blackmailing of Dr. Lexie Carver to keep Carrie and Austin apart. After Sami finally admits the truth about her misdeeds, a furious Carrie attacks her. The two sisters fight, and afterwards Carrie tells her half-sister that she will tell everyone in Salem what Sami did. Later, Carrie runs into Dr. Lexie Carver and reveals to her that she knows all about the bogus information Lexie was giving her due to Sami's blackmailing. Lexie tries to plead her case and apologize, but Carrie doesn't care and promises to pay Lexie back by reporting her to the hospital board and the AMA, upon which Lexie is subsequently fired. During dinner one night, Austin suggests to Carrie that they move to Switzerland, where he can work at the Mythic Communications division there and Carrie can reclaim High Style, her former company. Carrie agrees on one condition‚Äîthat they get married first. The two immediately go to the Justice of the Peace with their signed marriage license and get married, but not before getting briefly interrupted by a drunk Sami; and Carrie disowning her. After saying their goodbyes to John, Kate, Marlena and Roman, Austin and Carrie take a plane and leave Salem. 2011‚Äì2012 In September 2011, Carrie and Austin returned to Salem for the tribute to the Horton Center. Carrie mentioned that she had become a lawyer after her company Highstyle, which was division of the now defunct Mythic Communications, was forced to close down. Carrie then takes a job, as John's defense attorney. She works with brother- in-law Rafe to help find evidence that can exonerate John from the charges against him. In December, John is set free and is cleared of all charges. Carrie and Rafe continue to work together, eventually opening their own law/detective firm. Carrie and Rafe grow closer and are caught kissing by Sami and Austin. Carrie tells Rafe that she is in love with him and had separated from Austin, only to reunite following Abigail's confession that she did not truly sleep with Austin. Despite their reunion, Carrie can't shake her feelings of love towards Rafe. After the lives of Marlena, John, Hope and Bo are threatened by Stefano, Carrie and Rafe are become trapped inside of the safe house, which is alarmed with a bomb. While inside, she and Rafe confess their love for each other, nearly having sex, Rafe admits that EJ is the father of Nicole's child, not him. After they are safe from harm, Carrie begins to feel weak and sick. She confesses to Marlena that she was late, which arose suspicions of a possible pregnancy. After taking a take home test, it confirms her suspicion. A suspicious Austin sees the test and assumes it is his baby. Austin is thrilled about the news, but Carrie isn't as much since she loves Rafe. Rafe tells Carrie that she belongs with Austin and her child, and that they won't work out. Carrie decides to return to Switzerland with Austin, and says an emotional farewell to Rafe. But before leaving, Carrie urges Rafe to reconcile with Sami, because Carrie knows that they still love each other deep down. In 2014, Carrie supports Sami and Kate's decision to control DiMera's company.

After Steve is cleared, Harper hires Kayla to be his son Jack's nurse. An old friend of Kayla's, Jack falls in love with her. Steve knows how happy Kayla makes a dying Jack, who is secretly another sibling whom Jo Johnson had placed up for adoption. Devastated by Steve's rejection, Kayla marries Jack in the hopes it would help his health. Led to believe that Kayla knows the secret of Jack's past, Harper begins poisoning her. Steve rescues her when she is near death. Though the two are reunited, they agree not to tell Jack until after his election to the town council. However, Jack discovers the affair the night of the election and rapes Kayla in a fit of rage. Kayla charges Jack with rape, but thanks to a plea deal, Jack receives only a slap on the wrist, even after Kayla confronts him on the stand. Kayla loses her hearing during an attack at the loft, and cannot remember her attacker's face. Steve learns sign language to communicate with her, and Kim works with her to help her memory. During this period, Jack finally grants her the divorce, but Kayla isn't sure if she can marry Steve without her hearing. Kayla finally remembers Harper was the man who attacked her, just before being taken hostage by him at the loft. After that experience, Kayla undergoes a risky surgery to restore her hearing and agrees to marry Steve. After their marriage, Steve and Kayla almost adopt a young deaf boy named Benji, who is eventually found to be Stefano DiMera's son. Later, Steve helps Nick Corelli hide from the police. Nick gifts Steve and Kayla with a mansion for their trouble. In an old trunk in the mansion's attic, Steve and Kayla find an old civil war diary and spend time reliving the love story of Emily and Gideon. Later, while helping Marcus search for his own past in Charleston, SC, they visit significant sites in the diary. Marcus' search for his past leads to an involvement with a corrupt preacher. Steve agrees to undergo plastic surgery fix his eye, in order to infiltrate the preacher's camp for the ISA as Daniel Lucas. After the ISA operation ends with the appearance of Shane's death, life is upended for Steve and Kayla yet again when Marina Toscano appears, claiming to be Steve's presumed dead first wife. Knowing she is pregnant but not yet having told Steve, Kayla encourages Steve to help Marina, in hopes the old entanglements can be resolved. Marina and Steve travel to Italy to retrieve the key, where Kayla catches them in an apparently compromising situation. Steve's eye socket is damaged again in a fight, and he decides to start wearing the patch again. Back in Salem, Steve works to regain Kayla's trust, and is shocked to learn from Jack she is pregnant. Kayla and Marina argue in her hotel room, where Marina is later found dead. Kayla is kidnapped by Victor Kiriakis, and released in exchange for the key. Steve and Kayla plan another wedding, as their marriage had been invalidated by the fact of Marina, but Kayla is arrested during the ceremony for her murder. Kayla gives birth to Stephanie Johnson after going into labor on the witness stand. Convicted of murder, Kayla is sent to prison. At first she tries to keep Stephanie with her, but then decides prison was no place for a baby. Sheila the nanny, who had become obsessed with the baby, kidnaps Stephanie and takes her to Australia. Upon hearing of Stephanie's kidnapping, Kayla escapes from prison, and she and Steve follow Sheila to Australia where they manage to get their baby back. After word came that Kayla had been cleared of Marina's murder, they return to Salem, where they are finally legally married. In the fall of 1990, Steve decides to become a police officer. He is injured in a boat explosion, rigged by Lawrence Alamain and meant for Bo. Steve begins to recover, but is \\"killed\\" when Lawrence has his IV poisoned. Kayla moves in with Shane Donovan for protection, and the two eventually begin a relationship. Things become complicated when Kim returns to town in 1991 to find her sister and ex-husband living together, and circumstances lead her to become involved with Lawrence Alamain. Shane is paralyzed in the line of duty. At first he refuses to have the surgery to regain the use of his legs, but Kayla helps him recover as their relationship deepens. However, Kayla decides to move to Los Angeles in the spring of 1992 to start a new life for her and her daughter. 2006‚Äî In 2006, Kayla, now a doctor, returns to Salem for Frankie and Jennifer's wedding, having completed medical school in Los Angeles. She had been planning to go to Africa with Doctors Without Borders, but is shocked when Steve appears at the church. He doesn't remember his past, and she is devastated to think he doesn't know who she is and to watch him take up with Billie Reed. A series of events, including their daughter's race car crash and a stay in quarantine after being exposed to a toxin at the hospital, help slowly bring them back together. Eventually, a trip to a cabin where they once hid out together on the run sparks Steve's memory to return in its entirety, and the two are reunited. In 2007, Benji DiMera (who's forced by EJ) returns to Salem with a tarot card that turns Steve into a DiMera soldier. It turns out Stefano and EJ had tortured him during his missing years. Due to Steve's programming, Kayla is forced into removing John Black's kidney so an ailing Stefano can have it. Steve is committed to the mental hospital, and Kayla works to help him recover, despite his resistance. When his programming is again activated by EJ in order to have him kill Bo on Tinda Lau, Kayla is finally able to break through to him, and they spend some time on the island recovering. Back in Salem, Steve and Kayla begin to discuss the idea of having another baby. When Philip Kiriakis' son Tyler is abandoned anonymously at the hospital by Philip and Mimi's surrogate, Kayla and Steve take him in and care for him as Pocket. After Steve takes Stefano hostage in retaliation for Benji's murder when the vendetta heats up, social services take Pocket away when he becomes ill. Steve and Kayla are accused of poisoning him by Philip, but it turns out to be a rare genetic disorder. Steve and Kayla and Philip all decide it was in his best interest to go live with another foster family. In 2008, Kayla and Steve support Stephanie after it is revealed she was raped by Ford Decker. They travel to Ireland to help Shawn meet with the sister he had thought was dead. While there, Kayla learns she is pregnant. Kayla and Steve are both caught in the plane crash on the way back to Salem, which kills her father Shawn Brady and is later found to be the work of a deranged Ava Vitali. Kayla aids Daniel and Lexie in treating Bo's pancreas condition. Under all these stresses, she begins to have problems with her pregnancy, which leads Steve to keep the information about his ex-girlfriend Ava from her. Ava mistakenly kidnaps Hope thinking she is Kayla, but Steve, Kayla, and Bo soon follow to rescue Hope. Kayla discovers the pills Ava had been taking kept Ava from ever becoming sane. Afterward, Ava leaves Steve and Kayla alone, though she fled the country rather than pay for her crimes. Stressed, and with an already troubled pregnancy, Kayla goes into premature labor. Joseph Johnson is delivered at 26 weeks. After stabilizing, he is briefly kidnapped in the late summer of 2008 by Stefano DiMera. In early 2009, Kayla is accidentally shot by Hope at University Hospital, a situation Bo has foreseen in his psychic visions. Though the bullet penetrates the sac around the heart, Kayla recovers after surgery. Offscreen, Kayla and Steve decide to leave Salem to run a clinic in a remote part of the world. They take their infant son with them, and relay their decision and details of their situation to their daughter Stephanie in a letter, in April 2009. In June 2010, Kayla briefly returns along with several other Brady and Horton family members to pay respects to Alice Horton after she took ill. Kayla returned once again in December 2011 to assist Caroline in running the Brady Pub. She further confesses she and Steve were experiencing issues, and he was back in the ISA. She confessed that while he was the man she loved, he was not the man she wanted to be with. Cultural impact In the mid-80s, the baby name \\"Kayla\\" jumped from the roughly 900th most popular girl's name, to around the top 10, where it has remained ever since. This is widely attributed to Kayla Brady's arrival on the show, with which it coincides.Baby Names - Kayla See also References External links *Kayla Brady Johnson profile - SoapCentral.com Category:Days of Our Lives characters Category:Fictional physicians Category:Television characters introduced in 1982 Category:Fictional sexual assault victims ","title":"Kayla Brady"},{"id":"11745448","text":"Shakrial is a town in Rawalpindi District, Pakistan.

Its membership was drawn from patient groups, health care professionals and regulatory bodies. Following the implementation of the Health and Social Care Act 2008,Health and Social Care Act 2008 PIAG was abolished and its responsibilities transferred to a new body, the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care, with effect from January 2009. Terms of reference The terms of reference for the PIAG were to: #Advise the Secretary of State on use of powers provided by section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, and in particular on: #*applications and proposals for use of these powers; #*draft regulations made under s60(1) of the Act; #*proposals to vary or revoke such regulations following the Secretary of State's required annual review of existing provisions. #Advise the Secretary of State on key issues, particularly those of national significance, relating to the processing of patient information. Legal framework Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 (subsequently Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006) provided a power to ensure that patient identifiable information needed to support essential NHS activity could be used without the consent of patients. The power could only be used to support medical purposes that were in the interests of patients or the wider public, where consent was not a practicable alternative and where anonymised information would not suffice. It was intended largely as a transitional measure whilst consent or anonymisation procedures were developed, and this was reinforced by the need to review each use of the power annually. This was developed to cover situations where informed consent could not be obtained, for example research projects of such a size as to make contacting each patient impracticable, where the public good derived from the research was agreed to outweigh the individual right to privacy.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media and the license is held by Cumulus Licensing LLC. The WMXS studios are located on the 3rd floor of The Colonial Financial Center in downtown Montgomery, and the transmitter tower is in Montgomery's northeast side. It broadcasts a mainstream adult contemporary music format. The station was assigned the WMXS call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on February 24, 1994. History The original call letters for 103.3 were WAJM, which stood for \\"Advertiser-Journal Montgomery\\", named for the local newspaper. By 1974, it was FM sister to WMGY with the calls WMGZ, and a short-lived top-40 format using the name \\"Z-103.\\" By 1978, the frequency provided the beautiful music format as WREZ until the late 1980s. In November 1987, the station became known as WSYA, \\"Sunny 103\\" and changed to an adult contemporary format. In late 1989, WSYA briefly changed to an oldies-format (still known as \\"Sunny 103\\") to compete with Montgomery's other oldies outlet at the time, WBAM-FM, \\"Oldies 98\\". WSYA returned to an adult contemporary format a few months later, with radio personalities Kris O'Kelly and Joe Marcus, among others, on the air. The station's current incarnation as WMXS began using the name \\"Mix 103.3\\" in 1994. Legendary Montgomery DJ Larry Stevens and his partner Leslie Bailey were the morning show host on Mix for several years before Stevens left the station after a disagreement with management. The morning show was renamed \\"Leslie and Company\\" with production assistant Lee Edwards taking over for Stevens. The show only lasted 3 months before Bailey left and former WLWI-FM personality Dr. Sam Faulk took over the morning show. Dr. Sam did the show alone for a short time, then was paired with midday host Susan Woody (now with Alice 96.1). Woody left 16 months later and was replaced with Amy Delaney and, after 1 year, with Debbie Montgomery. Dr. Sam recently left the station and now does mornings on WLWI.

It is looking to repopulate the world's trees and combat climate change as a nature-based solution. The campaign is a continuation of the activities of the earlier Billion Tree Campaign, instigated by Wangari Maathai, who founded the Green Belt Movement in Africa in 1977. History The Green Belt Movement began its activity in Africa in 1977, eventually planting more than 30 million trees.Simon N Gosling (2012) ‚Äî Sustainability: The Geography Perspective, 13th page of chapter 6, University of Nottingham January 2013, ‚Äî accessed 2020-1-25 The Billion Tree Campaign was launched in 2006 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as a response to the challenges of climate change, as well as to a wider array of sustainability challenges from water supply to biodiversity loss, and achieved the initial target of planting a billion trees in 2007.(content retrieved 13 June 2007 & 28 March 2016, source added 22 August 2013 (14:16)): link content unavailable - , (alternative source added): Achim Steiner (UNEP), in, Alister Doyle ‚Äî More than 1 billion trees planted in 2007: U.N., Reuters 28 November 2007 - accessed 2020-1-23 (using \\"one billion trees in 2007 (achieved by November\\" with (google) In 2008, the campaign's objective was raised to 7 billion trees ‚Äì surpassed three months before its target of the climate change conference that was held in Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009.

We combine our forces, old and young, rich and poor; and together, we can plant a trillion trees. We can start the Trillion Tree Campaign.\\" In December 2011, after more than 12 billion trees had been planted, UNEP formally handed management of the program to the youth-led not-for-profit Plant-for-the-Planet Foundation (an organisation that had been participating in the Billion Tree Campaign since 2007), based in Tutzing, Germany. Momentum has since continued, with 40,000 young ambassadors spreading the message in over 100 countries.UNEP.

When an executive in the United States told Professor Maathai their corporation was planning to plant a million trees, her response was: \\"That‚Äôs great, but what we really need is to plant a billion trees.\\" The campaign was carried out under the patronage of Prince Albert II of Monaco. \\"It's the little things citizens do. That's what will make the difference. My little thing is planting trees.\\" ‚Äì Wangari Maathai Principles *Cutting fossil fuel emissions is more important. *Conserve existing ecosystems. *Restoration must be socially and ecologically responsible. Implementation Under UNEP‚Äôs leadership and through proactive advocacy by patrons and the partners, the Billion Tree Campaign has catalysed tree planting action on all continents. The billionth tree, an African Olive, was planted in Ethiopia in November 2007. The 2-billionth tree took root as part of the United Nation‚Äôs World Food Programme agroforestry initiative. The campaign‚Äôs target was then raised to seven billion trees. In 2009, UNEP mobilized action across the globe through the Twitter for Trees campaign. UNEP pledged to plant one tree to feed into the Billion Tree Campaign, for every follower who joined from 5 May 2009 to World Environment Day on 5 June 2009. The campaign was a success, with 10,300 people following the page by World Environment Day weekend.http://www.undp.org.tr/Gozlem2.aspx?WebSayfaNo=2035 (this source opens to 403 Forbidden - @ access made 2020-1-24) The World Organization of the Scout Movement also planted trees under the campaign, in line with its mandate to study and protect nature across several countries. United Nations Peacekeeping missions also joined the campaign and planted trees with its field missions in East Timor, Ivory Coast, Darfur, Lebanon, Haiti, Congo, and Liberia, among other missions. , 13.6 billion trees have been planted worldwide. Quote from UNEP \\"Looking back over the Billion Tree Campaign‚Äôs greatest successes, what is most remarkable is not its scale, but its spread.

Their aim is to provide detailed research on forestry companies and their activities to NGOs and interested citizen's groups, and so support and empower those people affected by bad practices. Forests Monitor is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation. Forests Monitor also contributes to the international and national forest policy formation through global processes such as the UNFF and regional forest law enforcement and governance (FLEG) processes such as the African FLEG and the ENA FLEG. The Concessions to Poverty report co-produced between Forests Monitor and The Rainforest Foundation addresses these issues. Activities Forests Monitor is the lead organisation on the current project of monitoring forest exploitation in the Republic of Congo, working in partnership with REM (Resource Extraction Monitoring). Forests Monitor along with UCL ExCiteS produced a beta version of a mobile application as part of their work in the Republic of Congo, which enables local communities to monitor forestry activities around their village. Although the app released on the organisation's website is only a beta version, the licence is Apache 2 open source, and the aim is to encourage other organisations to use this method to assist people in protecting their local environment. Forests Monitor supported the establishment of a charitable trust, Forests Monitor Charitable Trust. Forests Monitor Charitable Trust ceased activities in 2011.

He was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1933, and dismissed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, the Franco government appointed Tobe√±as to a chair in Zaragoza and, in 1940, again to the Supreme Court, which he reorganised and presided over from 1945 to 1967. In addition, he led several legal reform projects and edited Spain's principal legal journal, Revista general de legislaci√≥n y jurispridencia. His principal works, Derecho civil espa√±ol com√∫n y foral (1922) and Derecho civil (1941/42) became standard textbooks. Tobe√±as' judicial philosophy was guided by humanist and natural law ideas. He frowned on legal positivism and sought to soften the harshness of the law with individually tailored, socially responsible judgments of an independent judiciary. His work and personality caused Tobe√±as to be considered Spain's leading jurist in the years after the Civil War. Even today, his name remains synonymous with Spanish civil law.

Biography Born in London in 1936 at the family-owned Dorchester Hotel, McAlpine was the oldest son of Sir Edwin McAlpine, 5th Bt (who was given a life peerage as Lord McAlpine of Moffat in 1980) by his marriage to Ella Mary Gardner Garnett. His great-grandfather was \\"Concrete Bob\\", Sir Robert McAlpine, the first of the McAlpine baronets and the founder of the construction company. He had two younger brothers Alistair McAlpine, Baron McAlpine of West Green and David McAlpine. Brought up at the family home in Surrey and educated at Charterhouse, McAlpine joined the family firm from school, starting his career at the Hayes Depot in Middlesex, a site which housed the McAlpine railway locomotive and wagon fleet. The years after the Second World War were a busy time for the construction industry. He served in the Life Guards for two years from 1954. In 1973, Sir McAlpine purchased the historic British LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman steam locomotive, saving it from possible demise and repatriating it from the United States two years after a U.S. tour which had bankrupted its previous owner, Alan Pegler. Sir McAlpine maintained and ran the locomotive as a service to the British public and international steam community until the mid-1990s, when it was purchased by steam enthusiast Tony Marchington. In 1990, on the death of his father, McAlpine inherited his baronetcy and became Sir William. He was patron of the Clan MacAlpine Society.Official Homepage of the Worldwide Organization for MacAlpines He served as High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire for 1999.

An acknowledged railway enthusiast, McAlpine returned to Hayes depot during the Beeching Axe to find that the company's Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0ST No.31 was for sale for ¬£100. He purchased the locomotive, and moved it to his country estate home at Fawley, Buckinghamshire. This marked the start in 1961 of the Fawley Hill Railway, a private railway which now runs to over a mile long, combining the steepest gradient at 1:13 on a British railway, and includes: *The Great Eastern Railway Somersham railway station *Midland Railway signal box from Shobnall Maltings, near Burton upon Trent *The footbridge from Brading on the Isle of Wight, Bridge No 25, where it spanned the Ryde Pier to Shanklin line In addition, the perimeter of the railway line is adorned with several prominent architectural features which McAlpine acquired ‚Äì although these were received mostly as donations; these include the original Wembley Stadium Twin Towers flagpoles, some early cast-iron bridge parapets, and several arched structures from prominent London locations.

The station is still imaged on-air (although not exclusively) as \\"The Big BAM in Montgomery\\". During the first three years as \\"Bama Country\\" the station put on a series of concerts known as \\"The Bama Country Birthday Bash\\" with many of today's top country music artists. Bama Country Today From 2005, signed copy of the WBAM Birthday Bash advertisement in the GO! Section of the Montgomery Advertiser. The ad featured the up-and-coming group Sugarland. Since 2004, WBAM has broadcast a mainstream country format. The majority of the music played on WBAM tends to be newer and from more recent artists. Core artists include: Keith Urban, Brad Paisley, Toby Keith, Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Lady Antebellum, Rascal Flatts, Jason Aldean, and more. Legendary artists and songs are reserved for a weekly show titled: Legends Saturday Night which is hosted by JR \\"Bubba\\" Cullpepper. WBAM also features news and weather updates from CBS 8 WAKA, national news updates from Fox News Radio, and traffic from Montgomery Skywatch Traffic. Current Staff and Programming Announcer JR \\"Bubba\\" Cullpepper, CJ, and John Garrett live on location (2010) Notable local programming on WBAM includes: John Garrett, Dr. Sam Faulk, and JR \\"Bubba\\" Culpepper. Other programs include: Legends Saturday Night, American Country Countdown with Kix Brooks, Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40 and Rise up Country. WBAM-FM is also a Fox News Radio affiliate. Technical information WBAM's Transmitter (2013) For several years the WBAM-FM transmitter broadcast from the Montgomery Tower Partnership behind the Eastdale Mall in Montgomery, Alabama. The antenna is a shared panel which still broadcasts several other local FM radio stations. WBAM's Broadcast Tower (2013) In the late 1990s Cox Communications wanted to move a station into the Birmingham, Alabama radio market. In order to meet Minimum Distance Separation Requirementshttp://transition.fcc.gov/mb/audio/spacing/index.html set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), WBAM-FM had to first be re-located. The re-location was funded by Cox Communications and the new tower is located a few miles from the WSFA-TV tower in Grady, Alabama. WBAM-FM broadcasts with a transmitter power output of 30.26 kW using a Continental Electronics transmitter into an 8-Bay Shively Labs Super-High-Power 6814 non- directional antenna. WBAM-FM Longely-Rice Predicated Coverage Map Coverage information Because WBAM's antenna is nearly above sea level, it blankets Central and Southeast Alabama. WBAM can be heard in the Columbus, Georgia- Auburn, Alabama Combined Statistical Area, Alexander City Micropolitan Statistical Area, Dothan, Alabama metropolitan area and parts of the Florida Panhandle. WBAM is often received by many DXing enthusiasts, some as far away as Toms River New Jersey! Ownership In March 2004, Deep South Broadcasting Co. (Bob Brennen, owner) reached an agreement to sell this station to Bluewater Broadcasting Company, LLC. The sale was part of a multi- company four-station deal valued at a reported $15.3 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 21, 2004, and the transaction was consummated on June 21, 2004. At the time of the sale, WBAM-FM was broadcasting a Top 40 format. Awards and honors Paul Simpkins, an original WBAM on-air personality from the time of the station's launch in 1953 until the sale in 1984, received a number of honors during his more than three decades with the station. These include being named Sterling Magazine Personality of the Month and TV Radio Mirror Personality of the Month in 1967, 1968 and 1972. Simpkins was inducted into the Country Music DJ Hall of Fame in 1998. Cyril Brennan, the general manager and program director of WBAM, was named the 1976 \\"Program Director of the Year for Country Music\\" by Billboard magazine's International Radio Programming Forum. Popular culture WBAM is name-checked with \\"This is country country on WBAM coming to you live, neighbor\\" in the poem \\"Pickup\\" by American poet Paul Allen. Alabama author Paul Hemphill included references to WBAM in his 1979 novel Long Gone as the preferred radio station of the protagonist, Jamie Weeks. In 1987, Long Gone was made into a movie starring Dermot Mulroney by HBO Films. History of call letters The call letters WBAM were previously assigned to an FM station in New York City. That station's call letters were changed to WOR-FM June 13, 1948.

She was the Director of Children's Programs for CBS from 1930 to 1953. Born Nila Mac, she was an only child. She added a \\"k\\" to her name because she felt \\"Mac\\" looked like a nickname. However, some sources, including her obituary in The New York Times, said her birth name was Nila MacLoughlin.The New York Times, 21 January 1953, p. 31. Her mother, Margaret, was a dance instructor. Her father, Don Carlos, was a railroad engineer who died in a train accident when Nila was very young. After his death, she attended an Illinois finishing school, Ferry Hall in Lake Forest, and later took classes in both Arkansas City and Boston, financing her education by playing piano at her mother‚Äôs dance studio. Vaudeville to Broadway She joined a traveling repertory company where she met and married actor Roy Briant. She worked in vaudeville and spent six years with the Nazimova company, appearing with that troupe on Broadway in Fair and Warmer and A Doll‚Äôs House, as well as the play and film versions of War Brides (1918). When her husband died in December 1927, after 13 years of their marriage, Mack took various acting jobs and wrote comedy for Nydia Westman and Fanny Brice. Radio ‚ÄúBroadway prepared me for radio,‚Äù said Mack, who was cast in CBS‚Äô experimental Radio Guild of the Air, the series that evolved into the Columbia Workshop, and a CBS comedy show, Nit Wits. She scripted and narrated the Night Club Romances series.She Made It: Nila Mack In 1930 Mack returned to Arkansas City to care for her ailing mother and began working at the local radio station. However, after six months, she was contacted by CBS to take over its children‚Äôs program, The Adventures of Helen and Mary. Mack moved back to New York and began to retool the struggling program. Cast member Gwen Davies recalled that initially Mack ‚Äúwas terrified about working with children, because she never had any.‚Äù Eventually, she changed the content and casting, assembling a company of child actors, and retitling the series as Let's Pretend. The focus was on fantasy. She recalled, ‚ÄúWe were deep in the depression when Let‚Äôs Pretend began‚Ä¶ I remembered fairy stories that filled me with wonder when I was very young. I figured that if these lively pieces with a message at their hearts had meant so much to me, other children would like them, too.‚Äù In addition to original scripts, the series broadcast more than 300 fairy tale adaptations. Cream of Wheat signed on as the program's sponsor. Cast member Arthur Anderson wrote that she realized: :...how much better would be a cast of child actors, who could convey much more than grownups the openness, innocence and simplicity she wanted for the show... Besides Nila Mack‚Äôs scripts, her genius for choosing and working with her juvenile cast was the main reason the show survived longer than any other dramatic program on American radio. Nila Mack was... a lone woman in a man‚Äôs world. Awards With the success of Let's Pretend, CBS appointed her Director of Children's Programs. The series ran from 1934 to 1954, garnering numerous awards, including two Peabody Awards, a Women‚Äôs National Radio Committee Award and five Radio Daily Awards.

It is a national support organisation for international agricultural research (IAR). According to a paper prepared by its founder Professor Derek Tribe in July 1998, the origins of the Crawford Fund derive from a May 1986 meeting of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in Ottawa which considered the need for ‚ÄúBroadening Support for International Agricultural Research‚Äù. The focus was to be on funding for the CGIAR Centres and increased public awareness of the benefits that flow from agricultural research for development. In order to carry the message to a range of audiences it was decided that national support organisations should be established in member countries, starting with the USA, the UK, Canada, and Australia. During 1986, Professor Tribe with support from the Australian aid agency (ADAB, later AusAID), the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and the CGIAR Secretariat, explored the possibilities of establishing a national support organisation in Australia. Finding strong support in academic, political and business circles, he concluded that the Academy of Technological Sciences (and Engineering) would be an appropriate home for such an organisation. Named the Crawford Fund in honour of Sir John Crawford, The Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research is governed by its own Board, one or two members of which are on the Academy Board, and includes the part-time Executive Director. The current national chair of the Board is John Kerin. Purpose At the time the Fund was established, the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering defined its role as making ‚Äúmore widely known throughout Australia the benefits that accrue both internationally and to Australia from international agricultural research, and to encourage greater support for, and participation in, international agricultural R&D; by Australian governmental and non- governmental organisations and, in particular, the industrial, farming and scientific communities in Australia‚Äù. After some years, an independent assessment determined that The Crawford Fund was ‚Äúan independent and value- adding element of the Australian aid program‚Äù. This stimulated the Australian Government to support The Fund‚Äôs mission: to increase Australians‚Äô engagement in international agricultural research, development and education for the benefit of developing countries and Australia. The Crawford Fund networks via 70-odd office-bearers and committee members which are its greatest asset. They enable the Crawford Fund to liaise with policy-makers in Australia and overseas to a greater extent than its modest resources and profile would suggest. Activities ILRI, Feb 2016 The main activities of the Crawford Fund include awareness-raising to increase support for international agricultural research, the organisation of short-term practical training for agricultural researchers from developing countries, master classes for emerging research leaders, and two types of awards. The Public Awareness Program includes an annual conference at Parliament House, Canberra. The annual conference focuses on a selected aspect of international agricultural research, showcasing eminent speakers and promoting an intensive round of high-level meetings and media publicity.The annual conference is usually opened by a senior Australian minister. The 2009 conference, for example, was opened by the Australian foreign minister, the Hon Stephen Smith. . Since 2010, conferences have included: * Biodiversity and World Food Security (2010) * The Supermarket Revolution in Food: Good, Bad or Ugly for the World's Farmers, Consumers and Retailers? (2011) * The Scramble for Natural Resources: More Food, Less Land? (2012)Foreign Minister Bob Carr opened the conference in 2012. * Agriculture, Mining and Development: Bread from Stones? (2013) * Ethics, Efficiency and Food Security: Feeding the 9 Billion Well (2014) * The Business of Food Security: Profitability, Sustainability, and Risk (2015) * Waste Not, Want Not: The Circular Economy to Food Production (2016)2016 conference proceedings * Transforming Lives and Livelihoods: The Digital Revolution in Agriculture (2017) The Crawford Fund supports a range of other activities designed to encourage public awareness of the importance of international agricultural research for development. The Fund supports the preparation of various publications.See Derek E. Tribe (1991), Doing Well by Doing Good: Agricultural research: Feeding and greening the world, Leichhardt, NSW, Pluto Press . The Fund also organises other events such as meetings and conferences at the state level in Australia. For example, in 2011 the Crawford Fund sponsored a conference in Brisbane on the theme of 'A Food Secure World'. One of the aims of meetings of this kind is to provide the opportunity for eminent international speakers to address agricultural topics of global importance in Australia.The President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Kanoyo Nwanze, spoke to the Brisbane conference on the topic of A food secure world: Challenging choices for our North, opportunities for the South. Since its establishment, the Crawford Fund has provided training to about 8,000 researchers, research managers and farmers in dozens of developing countries. Two kinds of training are provided: * About 25 training awards are made each year to enable individual researchers from developing countries to undertake customised training in Australia in specific aspects of a wide range of topics in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. * Additionally, about 30 multi-participant training courses are conducted each year either in developing countries or Australia, covering a wide range of topics in agriculture and forestry by teams of experts from CSIRO, universities, state agriculture departments, etc. Approximately 40% of training awards and training courses are linked to ACIAR projects. The Crawford Fund also conducts Master Classes. These are high-level courses aimed at mid-level researchers and emerging research managers who undertake a short period of training (typically two weeks) on particular research issues. The maximum number of participants in any one class is set at approximately 20 people. Participants are hand-picked, as are the trainers.For an evaluation of one of the master classes, see J.R. McWilliam, R. Sdoodee, and L. Marlow (1997), 'Evaluation of the Crawford Fund master class in biotechnology: A tracer study of participants, their sponsoring institutions and course providers', Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, Publication code EEU-WP 27, . The Crawford Fund provides two prestigious training fellowships, the Derek Tribe Award and the Crawford Fund Fellowship, from a private donor. Awarded biennially, the Derek Tribe Award is presented to a senior researcher from a developing country. The Crawford Fellowship is presented to a young researcher from a developing country.

It is located in the townland of Carrownanty on the outskirts of Ballymote in southern County Sligo, Ireland. This area was known historically as √Åtha Cliath an Chorainn, which roughly translates as The Ford of the Hurdles of Corann. It is the last of the Norman castles in Connacht. It was probably built in order to protect the newly won possessions of Richard √ìg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster (also known as the Red Earl), in County Sligo, some distance from an earlier motte. Construction and design Ballymote Castle showing gatehouse Ballymote castle is a large enclosure castle, the most symmetrical of all the Irish \\"keepless\\" castles. It has many similarities with Beaumaris Castle, in Anglesey, Wales, built by King Edward I of England. The entrance, with a double towered gate, is in the north wall and had twin D-shaped towers. It has a gatehouse typical of the period, the outer portions of which have almost completely disappeared. The castle, however, remains an impressive structure. The interior measures about . There are three-quarter round towers at all four corners and also in the middle of the east and west walls. A postern gate, which was planned for the centre of the south wall, was never completed, probably because of the events of 1317, when the castle was lost to the O'Connors. A small square tower had protected this gate. Another view from the 1790s The walls are about thick and flanked with six noble towers. Passages of about wide ran through the centre of the walls all around and the passages were built in such a way that they gave access to the towers, and to the intervening curtain walls at different heights, thereby meeting the needs of attack or defence. No traces of the interior domestic buildings survive. Local folklore suggests that underground passages connected Emlaghfad church with the castle and with the nearby Franciscan Abbey, though such stories are common throughout Ireland and are unlikely to be based on fact. The Red Earl is also credited with building the ancient road from Boyle, County Roscommon to Collooney, known as B√≥thar an Corann and as the Red Earls Road. History of occupation Curtain wall and towers of Ballymote Castle The castle changed hands many times since construction. It was captured by the O'Connors of Sligo in 1317, but was taken by the Mac Diarmada, during the course of local struggles, in 1347. By 1381 it had passed to the McDonaghs. Although owned by Tadhg MacDermot, one of the last of the Kings of Moylurg in 1561, it appears to have passed to the O'Connor Sligo by 1571, at which time he surrendered the castle and had it regranted to him by James I of England. In 1577, the castle fell into English hands for a short period and then more permanently in 1584, when it was taken by the Governor of Connacht Richard Bingham. A lack of occupation levels implies that the building was virtually abandoned during the above period (from 1317 to 1584). The O'Connors, O'Hartes and O'Dowds sacked the castle in 1588. The English surrendered it in 1598 to the MacDonaghs who sold it shortly afterwards to Red Hugh O'Donnell (one source says he bought it for ¬£400 and 300 cows). It was from here that Red Hugh O'Donnell marched to the disastrous Battle of Kinsale in 1601. When the O' Donnells surrendered it to the English in 1602, it was already in a bad state of repair. In 1633, the Taaffes owned it for a short time, but had to surrender it again to the English Parliamentary forces in 1652. In the Williamite wars the castle was held by Captain Terence MacDonagh for King James II, but he had to surrender it to Lord Granard in the face of an artillery attack in 1690. Soon afterwards the fortifications were made harmless, the moat was filled up and the castle fell into ruins. In more recent years the Office of Public Works have carried out preservation work on the castle. Access The castle is on the R296, Ballymote to Tubbercurry road, opposite the Ballymote railway station, and just past the Catholic church. Access is through the grounds of the Ballymote Community nursing unit. Unfortunately access inside the castle is currently prohibited as it has been deemed unsafe by the office of public works.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media and the license is held by Cumulus Licensing, LLC. The WLWI studios are located on the third floor of The Colonial Financial Center in downtown Montgomery, and the transmitter tower is in Montgomery's southside. It broadcasts a news/talk radio format to the Montgomery metropolitan area. Notable local programming includes \\"Decisions\\" with retired Army Sergeant Kevin Elkins and \\"Tactics\\" with former national debate champion and minister Caleb Colquitt. Notable syndicated programming includes Mark Levin, Rush Limbaugh, The Sean Hannity Show, and Michael Savage. Overnight, the station broadcasts the syndicated Red Eye Radio. The station also carries all 140 games of the local Minor League Baseball team the Montgomery Biscuits. History The beginning This station, the oldest radio station in Montgomery and the fourth oldest in Alabama, began broadcasting as WSFA on April 30, 1930. Montgomery's next oldest, WCOV (now WGMP), didn't begin broadcasting until February 1939. The radio station's callsign, intended to promote Montgomery's city air field, stood for \\"With the South's Finest Airport\\". A formerly-affiliated Montgomery television station (then WSFA-TV, now simply WSFA) still holds this historic callsign. WSFA was originally operated under the ownership of the Montgomery Broadcasting Company, Inc., a partnership between local businessmen Howard Pill and Gordon Persons. Persons, who stepped down as president of the company in 1939, would go on to serve as the forty-third governor of Alabama from 1951 to 1955. Country music legend Hank Williams got his start as a professional musician in 1936 with regular appearances on WSFA. It was during this period that he formed his longtime backing band, the Drifting Cowboys. Southern Gospel family group the Speer Family joined the station in 1941 until they moved on to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1946. The WHHY era The station was acquired by Broadcast Service of Montgomery, Inc., under the ownership of Charles W. Holt, Connie I. Holt, and Robert N. Robinson, as part of the Holt Broadcasting Service, on January 9, 1957. The station was renamed WHHY to match the other stations owned by Holt Broadcasting at the time: WHSY in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, WHNY in McComb, Mississippi, WHXY in Bogalusa, Louisiana, and KOME in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Holt and Robinson families maintained ownership of the WHHY until Holt-Robinson Communications encountered financial difficulties and was placed into receivership. The license for WHHY was involuntarily transferred to receiver Thomas M. Duddy in May 1993. The transfer was approved by the FCC on June 21, 1993. In May 1995, Duddy reached an agreement to sell this station to McDonald Investment Company, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 3, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on August 30, 1995. In October 1996, McDonald Investment Company, Inc., applied to the FCC to transfer the license for this station to McDonald Media Group, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 7, 1996, and the transaction was consummated on December 2, 1996. The WLWI era Known as WHHY since 1957, the station changed call letters to the current WLWI on October 19, 1999. In December 1999, McDonald Media Group, Inc., made a deal to sell this station to Citation Limited Partnership, owned by Citation Cablevision, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 17, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on January 20, 2000. In September 2000, Citation Limited Partnership reached an agreement to sell this station to Cumulus Media subsidiary Cumulus Licensing Corp. as part of a three station deal valued at a reported $10 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 12, 2001, and the transaction was consummated on May 15, 2001.

This church is a surviving representative of the oldest wooden churches of Maramure»ô: those with only one level of eaves.  Construction  The wooden church from S√¢rbi Susani, was dendrochronologically dated from the winter of 1638‚Äì1639, i.e., from the moment the timbers were felled; thus the construction might have taken place during 1639 or very soon after that. This church appears to have been built by the same master carpenter as those from SlƒÉtioara (before 1639) and Bude»ôti Josani (1643). S√¢rbi Susani, the northern side This church is quite modest in size, yet still really charming. Around its sanctuary the master carpenter played with the consoles under the eaves purlins like nowhere else. His devotion for this sacred building can be further read in the warm way he softened the plain timber walls with the rope moulding all around, with the small cuts in the frame of the southern window and even of the precinct gate, which, although fragmentary, is probably the oldest one surviving in Maramure»ô. The noble founders of this modest house of worship might have been either poor or conservative, if they couldn't afford or did not wanted bells for a tower, iron for the hinges of the doors, carved stones for the altar table or glasses for the windows. Whatever the situation was, the carpenter had to solve the shortage of resources in a very traditional way, replacing the missing materials with pieces of wood. These could have been the reasons why the church from S√¢rbi Susani retains the most ancient features in the local architecture.  The enigmatic message on the portal  The best- preserved portal in Maramure»ô, which entirely displays the high professional grade of a church carpenter, is in S√¢rbi Susani. Among the various designs recorded on the portals around Maramure»ô this is without a doubt the most intricate and rich in detail known. Due to its rich symbolism, it needs three levels of reading: descriptive, mythological, and Christian. The distinctive features that immediately attract attention are the moulding rope inclosing an elaborate composition of triple crosses and rosettes of various patterns and sizes. The triple crosses occupy the middle field of the three pieces of the portal, whereas the largest rosettes appear on both sides of each cross. The upper corners are covered by large sun rosettes while at the sill the straight mouldings turn round inwards closing the work. The entire composition has a symmetrical scheme, yet with many different details. Finally, a multitude of small triangles breaks up the background in shifting spots of light and shadow. At this descriptive level we should remark the inimitable artistic sensibility of this church carpenter. He worked not only with the wood but also with the light that touched it to create a unique aura around this passage into a sacred room. S√¢rbi Susani, the portal at the entrance We need to further focus on this exceptional portal and its potential mythological message. It has been long emphasised the importance of the solar symbols in the local vernacular art. Yet, this portal displays only two rosettes that can be related to the sun and possibly the cross as a symbol of Jesus Christ, which actually is also connected to the sun. The other symbols are rather linked to the other celestial body, i.e., the Moon. The relief moulding rope seems to indicate the presence of the snake, which, like other monsters in ancient legends, protects the sacred room. The snake is a dominant motif on the church portals throughout the Carpathian Mountains, most often in stylized form, but in a few cases even in plain shapes. According to Mircea Eliade, the snake was considered a lunar beast in the old European beliefs, and therefore it is possible to read the lower part of the portal, on each side, as a full or new moon coiled up by a snake. In the same context, we should move our attention upon the indented pattern around the aperture, which in the imagery of the local needle women represents the water wave or the river water, possibly the life-giving water of a spring, surprisingly identical with the old Egyptian hieroglyph for running water. Consequently, the small triangles filling the space in between the rosettes and crosses may represent small drops of rain fertilising the fields. Naturally, we may wonder: what do these ancient symbols want to tell us? In the ensemble moon-snake-rain or running water the church carpenter seems to have sought for the regenerating power of nature. There is a still higher level to decode the composition on the portal of the entrance. From a Christian perspective, this complex composition with heavenly bodies closely illustrates a Byzantine liturgical calendar. As in the West, the Byzantine liturgical year consists of two overlaying cycles with their respective series of feasts. First it is the Easter cycle (ciclu pascal) of the moveable feasts and second the monthly cycle (ciclu sanctoral) of the fixed feasts. In the Byzantine rite, the offices of the monthly cycle for fixed feasts are gathered in twelve books, one for every month, all together named Menaion. The Easter cycle is centred on the variable date of the commemoration of the Christ's Passion and is divided in three periods: the pre-paschal (10 weeks before Resurrection day), the paschal (8 weeks, from the Resurrection day to Whitsunday), and the post-paschal (variable number of weeks in between the other two periods). The service books containing the specific offices for the three periods are named Triodion, Pentecostarion and respectively Octoechos. The three periods are therefore better known by the names of their respective offices. On the portal from S√¢rbi Susani we can first distinguish the moulding rope carved in relief protecting the entrance and the composition. Starting from the coiled moon at the left and going round to the other coiled moon at right, the moulding rope represents the ecclesiastic year as a whole, from the month of September to August, according to the Byzantine practice. The brake in three parts of the moulding suggests the division in three periods of the Easter cycle. Accordingly, the three pieces of the portal should represent, from left to right, in a sunwise move, the Octoechos, Triodion and Pentecostarion periods. Indeed, the Octoechos period is particularly individualized on the left jamb by the 8 lateral small rosettes representing the characteristic 8 modes in which the hymns of the offices are sung. Moreover, the additional 9th rosette at the very bottom might allude to the distinctive 9 odes of the canon in the Octoechos. The right jamb is in its turn identified with the Pentecostarion period by another 5 lateral rosettes hinting at the Pentecost or the period of 50 days after the Passover. The lintel in between naturally represents the Triodion period and needed no distinctive signs. Once the three parts of the portal are identified with the three periods of the Easter cycle, the expected significance of the triple crosses in the middle fields should be the main feasts commemorating the life and the activity of the Christ. Thus, the triple cross at the left corresponds to Christ's Nativity and baptism, the one in the middle above the entrance commemorates Christ's Passion and the third one at the right is a symbol of Christ's Resurrection and Ascension and nevertheless of the descent of the Holy Ghost or the Whitsunday. As a result, the entire Easter cycle appears well illustrated. In order to be complete, this calendar only needs the presence of the monthly cycle. Indeed, the twelve rosettes flanking the triple crosses, 6 small and 6 large, represent the 12 moons or months of the year. In the upper corners, the large discs seem to mark the sun at the winter (left) and summer (right) solstices. The presence of all the major feasts and offices along the entire Byzantine ecclesiastic year gives the impression to call the worshipers to plainly participate in them. It is possible that the water wave around the aperture might represent the Jordan River and eventually even the Holy Spirit in which Jesus was baptised. Moreover, the small triangles entirely filling the space in between the large figures seem to further urge the Christians to uninterrupted prays. This is a strong invitation to improve through faith in Christ and participation in the life of the Church, in a true Byzantine monastic tradition. The third level gives the most comprehensible reading of the portal's composition. Its Christian symbolism strongly revolves around the Passion of Jesus and the salvation of humankind deriving from it. The mythological reading does not impede the Christian message since both seek heavenly regenerating gifts. We stand here in front of a rich and refined language of vernacular and Christian symbols, aimed to lift our souls, hearts and minds beyond the limits of our earthly existence. Actually, this is one of the main fascinations with numerous portals from the wooden churches all around the Carpathian Mountains. The central motif, of the middle cross representing Christ's Passion and the side rosettes representing the two solstices, concentrates the Christian message being often carved on church and house portals. This reading appears now obvious thanks to the elaborate composition from S√¢rbi Susani. There is an imperative need to document the hundreds of surviving portals left by the church carpenters in the Carpathians, go beyond their decorative beauty and recover their enigmatic language. That would be a great achievement for the European cultural heritage.

In November 2014 plans were unveiled to reorder the church, creating an outstanding venue for performances, exhibitions and banquets, a visitor destination, and a place where those in need of help can find assistance. The aim is to create a place for the whole community, and a venue that will be a driving force in the regeneration of Hull's Old Town. The transformation, costing a total of ¬£4.5 million, will take place in phases from 2016 onwards, the first being ready for UK City of Culture in 2017. On 7 November 2016, Archbishop of York John Sentamu announced that the church would be given Minster status in a ceremony on 13 May 2017. Sentamu came to Hull on 13 May in a flotilla of boats with a lantern lit at All Saints' Church, Hessle to rededicate the church as Hull Minster. In March 2019, the Minster received a grant of ¬£3.9 million from Highways England to create a visitor centre, caf√© and exhibition spaces.

A dihydrate is also known. It is a colorless solid, often referred to as ammonium paramolybdate or simply as ammonium molybdate, although \\"ammonium molybdate\\" can also refer to ammonium orthomolybdate, (NH4)2MoO4, and several other compounds. It is one of the more common molybdenum compounds.  Synthesis  Ammonium heptamolybdate is easily prepared by dissolving molybdenum trioxide in an excess of aqueous ammonia and evaporating the solution at room temperature. While the solution evaporates, the excess of ammonia escapes. This method results in the formation of six-sided transparent prisms of the tetrahydrate of ammonium heptamolybdate.L. Svanberg & H. Struve, J. pr. Ch. 44 [1848], p. 282; cited in Gmelin's Handbuch f√ºr Anorganische Chemie, 53, p. 255. Solutions of ammonium paramolybdate react with acids to form molybdic acid and an ammonium salt. The pH value of a concentrated solution will lie between 5 and 6. Structure The compound was first analyzed crystallographically by Lindqvist, but has been reanalyzed.Evans, H.T., Jr.; Gatehouse, B. M.; Leverett, P. \\"Crystal Structure of the Heptamolybdate(VI) (paramolybdate) ion, (Mo7O24)6‚àí, in the ammonium and potassium tetrahydrate salts\\" Journal of the Chemical Society. Dalton Transactions, Inorganic Chemistry1975, p.505-p514. All Mo centers are octahedral. Some oxide ligands are terminal, some doubly bridging, and a few are triply bridging ligands.

Synopsis The game is set in the year 4620. There are seven major civilizations in space, humankind is one of them. The story is that an attack led by an unknown evil alien race has almost destroyed the seven civilizations, and they are therefore now trying to expand furthest in order to ensure their continued survival. However, a powerful character with devious motives known as Enais is interfering with the seven civilizations and their expansion plans. You play the leader of one of the seven civilizations and must bring this civilization to victory by dominating the galaxy. It is possible to achieve victory through military domination, diplomacy, research, culture, or by killing the character Enais. The game was released June 14, 2007 and quickly went to the top of the charts on the Paradox Interactive homepage. It featured 7 major races, 45 minor races, a huge tech tree, 3D-battles, a very large galaxy with 5000 solar systems, and a special dragon-like race called the Chi Lung-race, which the player can choose to play. The game is mod-able with the possibility to tweak and change science descriptions, their effects, races, artwork, all text, and more. Lost Empire was nominated \\"Best Game of the Year\\" in 2006 at the D3Expo. Civilizations *Humans A race of stubbornness and self-righteousness, qualities which have made them one of the toughest races in the galaxy. Humans are good at everything but excel in nothing. The mad Goddess Enais left the humans in the dark after failing to convert them to her ways. However, she is always watching them... *Tritons Once proud and lazy, the Tritons had only managed to build a few drones when they were attacked by the mad Goddess Enais. They have learned the hard way that having the weakest firepower in battle is a costly thing. Now, they are one of the most ambitious races. Never again will they be attacked unprepared. *Horde Though not excelling individually, the sheer numbers of the Horde make them a formidable fighting force. The Horde has found that even though battles are lost, there are always plenty of fighting force left among the surviving masses, and so they always come back for more. Several now extinct races witnessed this ruthless perseverance of the Horde as it sealed their fate. *Chi Lung Enormous dragonbeings which evolved and prospered by devouring their home planet animals. When they figured out that they could actually leave their home planet and explore the galaxy on their own, many worlds came to suffer as the fearsome hungry beasts took what they needed to survive. Chi Lung never invented the wheel but who needs a wheel when you fly? Instead they evolved via mental training. *Megalanians These aristocratic beings constitute a highly intelligent scientific oriented race. Although suffering from mild megalomania they tend to be peaceful when they get their way. They consider themselves the most superior race in the Universe, since the evil goddess Enais cannot be considered a whole race. *Crystal Spirits These elusive creatures are quite evolved mentally and have become very adept at controlling the advanced computer systems they steal from other races. Even though they are only capable of taking physical form inside crystals, their superior knowledge of their native state highly increases their production rate and survivability. Their vast knowledge of computers also grants them a certain reputation in battle. *Alkiths Tall, secretive, and mystical, the Alkith race likes to keep out of sight until the right moment when they strike with extreme almost magical power. Alkiths were once the pawns of Enais, but have recently broken free and now seek revenge searching the Path of Enais relentlessly. Most races believe the Alkith have some form of secret weapon they have inherited from Enais. *Enais The information in this report is sketchy at best, and is a collection of our current available information on the creature known as Enais. Species: Unknown. Technological level: Probably beyond anything known. Enais is a creature which is deeply interwoven in the story line of Lost Empire. The player will find traces of her, and maybe even encounter her while playing. She is quite hostile, and very, very technologically advanced. The player might acquire her technology and use it to win the game. The player has to colonize all ten planets leading to Enais‚Äô hideout in order to do this. However, it is very likely that Enais will attack any that threaten to steal her advanced technologies. Remake A follow up on this title called Lost Empire: Immortals, a revamped version of the game, was released March 11, 2008. This new version is based on the original design but now improved by Jonas M√∏ller. Lost Empire Immortals received a Metacritic score of 58, which means \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. Reviewers praised the graphics and the scale of the game, but criticized the awkward interface, computer AI, and balance problems with very large galaxies.

Dryden, Texas History The community was founded in 1882 and named for Eugene E. Dryden, the chief engineer of the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, which was building its tracks through Terrell County and established a section house at Dryden. Over the next several decades Dryden became a small center for ranching-based businesses. The headquarters for the Pecos Land and Cattle Company was established in Dryden in 1884. The company drilled a well that supplied the area with water. By 1912, a hotel, the Dryden Hotel, had been established, along with a combined schoolhouse, community center, and church. Dryden had a population of nearly 100 by 1929. Two units of U.S. Army troops were stationed in Dryden during the 1913-17 Mexican border unrest. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the railway moved its crews and closed its depot at Dryden, and the area‚Äôs ranches were eventually broken up. Population began to dwindle to approximately fifty by 1970. Although a general store was operating in 1995, the population continued to decline to thirteen by 1988. The post office dates from 1888. The United States Postal Service currently maintains a post office in Dryden. Wayne Sutton has been appointed mayor by the other residents.

He is best known for the compilation of Chaoxian shi xuan (ÊúùÈÆÆË©©ÈÄâ), a collection of several hundred poems written by Korean scholars in classical Chinese. Much of what is known about Wu Mingji is contained in the preface to Chaoxian shi xuan. Wu visited Korea twice during the Imjin War, as an advisor to the Ming expeditionary army. Wu was able to meet with many of the Korean literati. In 1598, he met with Heo Gyun, one of the leading scholars of the Joseon kingdom. Heo composed a poem in Wu's honour, in which he celebrated the common brotherhood of men despite their nationalities. On his second tour of Korea, Wu Mingqi made a concerted effort to collect the works of Korean poets. The final work Wu produced was the Chaoxian shi xuan (\\"Selected poems from Joseon\\"), the first Chinese anthology of Korean poetry. It included 340 poems by 112 Korean poets from the Silla period onwards, and was divided into seven parts according to genre. The Chaoxian shi xuan became the subject of scholarly interest in the 17th century, when it was catalogued by bibliographers. The Qing scholar Qian Qianyi incorporated a dozen poems from Wu's collection into his Lidai shiji (Ê≠∑‰ª£Ë©©ÈõÜ), as did Zhu Yizun into his Ming shi zong (ÊòéË©©Á∂ú).

Its ecclesiastic territory includes the capital city of Kinshasa and surrounding districts. The archdiocese is the metropolitan see for the Ecclesiastical Province of Kinshasa. The current archbishop is Fridolin Ambongo Besungu. Established as the Apostolic Vicariate of the Belgian Congo by Pope Leo XIII in 1888, it was raised to the status of an archdiocese in 1959. In 1966, its name was changed from the Archdiocese of L√©opoldville to the Archdiocese of Kinshasa. Today, the archdiocese covers a territory of 8,500 km2 (3,283 sq mi) and, as of 2016, has a total population of 11,323,000, of whom 6,378,000 (56.3%) are Catholic. The archdiocese is served by 1,208 priests, including 238 diocesan priests and 970 religious priests, 1,661 male religious (including religious priests and brothers), and 1,982 religious sisters. The archdiocese has 143 parishes, including the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Congo in Kinshasa.  History  The archdiocese was established on 22 November 1886 as the Mission sui iuris of the Belgian Congo, from territory taken from both the Apostolic Prefecture of Lower Congo (in Cubango, Angola) and the Apostolic Vicariate of Two Guineas (in Gabon). It was promoted on 11 May 1888 as the Apostolic Vicariate of Belgian Congo. Over time, it lost territory repeatedly: to establish the Mission sui juris of Kwango on 18 April 1892, the Apostolic Prefecture of U√©l√© on 12 May 1898, the Mission sui juris of Kasa√Ø Sup√©rieur on 26 July 1901, the Apostolic Prefecture of Stanley Falls on 3 August 1904, the Apostolic Prefecture of Ubangui Belge on 7 April 1911, and the Apostolic Prefecture of Matadi and the Apostolic Prefecture of Northern Katanga on 1 July 1911. On 3 April 1919, it was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of L√©opoldville. It lost territory several times more: to establish the Mission sui juris of Bikoro on 3 January 1931, the Apostolic Vicariate of Boma on 26 February 1934, the Apostolic Prefecture of Kole on 14 June 1951, and the Apostolic Vicariate of Inongo on 29 June 1953. It was elevated on 10 November 1959 as the Archdiocese of L√©opoldville, when the city was soon to become the national capital of the newly independent Republic of the Congo. It was renamed the Archdiocese of Kinshasa on 30 May 1966, when the city's name was changed from L√©opoldville to Kinshasa. The archdiocese was visited by Pope John Paul II in May 1980 and again in August 1985. Bishops Ordinaries ;Apostolic Vicars of the Belgian Congo *Fran√ßois Camille Van Ronsl√©, C.I.C.M.

Alfaguara) The Porcelain Fat Lady () is a children's story by the Chilean writer Isabel Allende. Style The story is told by a firstly unknown person. The person itself knows the story so perfectly and detailed since the protagonist himself told it her once. Plot The story deals with Don Cornelio, who in the beginning lives a boring and monotonous life as a typist in a notary agency. He never gets too late, always leaves his house at the same time. He always takes the same green line bus, day in, day out. 7 days a week. But one day his life changes - the day when he sees La gorda de porcelana standing barely dressed in a store window and decides to buy her (also named Fantas√≠a). She fascinates him from the very first moment, winks at him, and so he is prepared to pay an entire month's salary for her. From this day on (which is point-of-no-return in the story), his life changes. Since he is not allowed to bring Fantas√≠a into his flat, he tries to hide her at work. At work their friendship begins. Don Cornelio opens the window, since this is what the vivid Fantas√≠a is asking for, and Fantas√≠a takes him out for a flight. For Fantas√≠a Don Cornelio gives up his job after 20 years of loyal work, and starts a whole new life. He conquers his shyness, talks to all the people in the park he has seen all the years before during his breaks and becomes a colourfully dressed and very happy ice cream and chestnut seller. Inspiration for the story The story might be an allegory of the Pinochet regime in Chile. At the same time, the story was written when Isabel Allende got a divorce from her first husband in 1973, which may have inspired the monotonous life of protagonist Don Cornelio (like that of Allende while she was married).

A committee was established under the chairmanship of Dame Fiona Caldicott, Principal of Somerville College, Oxford, and previously President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Its findings were published in December 1997. The Caldicott Report highlighted six key principles, and made 16 specific recommendations. In 2012 Dame Fiona produced a follow up report which made 26 further recommendations including the addition of a seventh principle which is included in the list below. In 2016 a further follow-up report was produced following controversy over the care.data initiative from HSCIC. Caldicott principles #Justify the purpose(s) Every single proposed use or transfer of patient identifiable information within or from an organisation should be clearly defined and scrutinised, with continuing uses regularly reviewed, by an appropriate guardian. #Don't use patient identifiable information unless it is necessary Patient identifiable information items should not be included unless it is essential for the specified purpose(s) of that flow. The need for patients to be identified should be considered at each stage of satisfying the purpose(s). #Use the minimum necessary patient-identifiable information Where use of patient identifiable information is considered to be essential, the inclusion of each individual item of information should be considered and justified so that the minimum amount of identifiable information is transferred or accessible as is necessary for a given function to be carried out. #Access to patient identifiable information should be on a strict need- to-know basis Only those individuals who need access to patient identifiable information should have access to it, and they should only have access to the information items that they need to see. This may mean introducing access controls or splitting information flows where one information flow is used for several purposes. #Everyone with access to patient identifiable information should be aware of their responsibilities Action should be taken to ensure that those handling patient identifiable information - both clinical and non-clinical staff - are made fully aware of their responsibilities and obligations to respect patient confidentiality. #Understand and comply with the law Every use of patient identifiable information must be lawful. Someone in each organisation handling patient information should be responsible for ensuring that the organisation complies with legal requirements. #The duty to share information can be as important as the duty to protect patient confidentiality Professionals should in the patient's interest share information within this framework. Official policies should support them doing so. These principles have been subsumed into the NHS confidentiality code of practice. Summary of recommendations in original report #Every dataflow, current or proposed, should be tested against basic principles of good practice. Continuing flows should be re-tested regularly. #A programme of work should be established to reinforce awareness of confidentiality and information security requirements amongst all staff within the NHS. #A senior person, preferably a health professional, should be nominated in each health organisation to act as a guardian, responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of patient information. #Clear guidance should be provided for those individuals/bodies responsible for approving uses of patient-identifiable information. #Protocols should be developed to protect the exchange of patient-identifiable information between NHS and non-NHS bodies. #The identity of those responsible for monitoring the sharing and transfer of information within agreed local protocols should be clearly communicated. #An accreditation system which recognises those organisations following good practice with respect to confidentiality should be considered. #The NHS number should replace other identifiers wherever practicable, taking account of the consequences of errors and particular requirements for other specific identifiers. #Strict protocols should define who is authorised to gain access to patient identity where the NHS number or other coded identifier is used. #Where particularly sensitive information is transferred, privacy enhancing technologies (e.g. encrypting identifiers or \\"patient identifying information\\") must be explored. #Those involved in developing health information systems should ensure that best practice principles are incorporated during the design stage. #Where practicable, the internal structure and administration of databases holding patient-identifiable information should reflect the principles developed in this report. #The NHS number should replace the patient's name on Items of Service Claims made by General Practitioners as soon as practically possible. #The design of new systems for the transfer of prescription data should incorporate the principles developed in this report. #Future negotiations on pay and conditions for General Practitioners should, where possible, avoid systems of payment which require patient identifying details to be transmitted. #Consideration should be given to procedures for General Practice claims and payments which do not require patient-identifying information to be transferred, which can then be piloted.

He grew up with a brother and sister in the working-class Divis Flats area of Falls Road in Belfast.Ingle, Roisln (30 June 2007), \\"The writing's on the Wall\\", Irish Times. He joined YouthAction NI's Rainbow Factory, a cross-community drama troop for Catholic and Protestant children and also got to spend time in the United States in the summer as part of an exchange programme. His mother found a role for him by checking the local newspapers, and he soon won the stage production part of the Artful Dodger in Oliver Twist. He also got lead roles in productions of Bugsy Malone and The Crucible. Popular in Northern Ireland for various sketches (including the trendy priest) in 'Dry Your Eyes', he had a feature role in a short film by Simon Fitzmaurice called The Sound of People. He followed that up with his feature film debut (as Jimmy Riley) in Closing the Ring (2007), directed by Richard Attenborough. Attenborough cast McCann in the film after seeing him in a stage production of A Clockwork Orange.Dougan, Andy (20 December 2007), \\"Attenborough and Spielberg back Martin for Stardom\\", Evening Times McCann had a role in the film My Boy Jack (as Guardsman Bowe), about Rudyard Kipling and his son, who was killed in World War I.'' McCann plays Sergeant R. V. Burgin in the miniseries The Pacific, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, which aired in March 2010. In an interview for Film Ireland, McCann says he auditioned several times for the role in London and twice in Los Angeles. He contacted Lord Attenborough's assistant to send Spielberg samples of his work to increase his chances of getting the role. In early 2010 he was shooting in Belfast for the music-comedy Killing Bono, a film released in April 2011 about the life of one of Bono's classmates who tries to make it in the music business, only to have his failures and frustrations magnified by the continued rise of U2. McCann plays the supporting role of Bono. In 2011, McCann completed a principal role in Terry George's Whole Lotta Sole, He was also cast in the twelve part mini series drama chronicling the building of the Titanic and the story about the ship before it left on its maiden voyage. In February 2011, Martin won the 2011 Irish Film and Television Academy Award for lead actor in a feature film. McCann was awarded this for his performance as Occi Byrne in Swansong produced by Zanzibar films. In 2016, he voiced Bobby Sands in reenactments in the documentary film Bobby Sands: 66 Days, and he also starred in The Survivalist, as 'Survivalist'. He starred in the Oscar nominated and BAFTA winning short film Boogaloo and Graham. In the 2017 film Maze, depicting the 1983 prison break at HM Prison Maze outside of Belfast, McCann played Oscar, one of the imprisoned IRA officers. In 2017, actor Woody Harrelson cast Martin McCann in his directorial debut Lost in London. This was the first 'live streamed' feature film direct to cinemas. In 2018 he starred in the British thriller Calibre, directed by Matt Palmer. He played Marcus, an Edinburgh business man who takes his friend on a hunting trip in the Scottish highlands. The film won the Michael Powell award for Best British Film at the 2018 Edinburgh International Film Festival. He has been nominated for a 2018 BAFTA award in the best actor category by BAFTA Scotland Awards for his portrayal of Marcus Trenton in the 'Netflix Original' film 'Calibre'. Other McCann is a Patron of the charity YouthAction Northern Ireland, whose Rainbow Factory School of Performing Arts is one of the largest youth arts projects with 500 young people taking part in a range workshops and classes.

It is the key to the implementation of the electronic health record, and is to be incorporated in all new software deployed within the National Health Service (NHS). The modern style of NHS number was generally introduced in 1996, although they were allocated to every new-born baby since July 1995, before becoming mandatory on 1 April 1997. It replaced the previous system founded on wartime identity card numbers, which in England and Wales used letters and digits (e.g. JRDAN 269); Scotland used numbers based on households with individuals further identified within the household (e.g. STUV123:3), and this meant that it was hard to validate a specific number. The numerical part of ID/NHS numbers allocated to people born after the Second World War in England and Wales matched the birth register entry number (i.e. a person whose birth was entry number xy would have an ID/NHS number in the format LLLLxy). Between 1969 and July 1995, the old-style NHS number was used on a baby's birth certificate as the reference number for the certificate. The current system uses a ten-digit number in '3 3 4' format with the final digit being a check digit. Examples given include 987 654 4321. The format includes an error-detecting checksum, which is the role of the final digit. Ignoring the check digit, each of the first nine digits is multiplied by 11 minus its position. Using the number 943 476 5919 as an example: * The first digit is 9. This is multiplied by 10. * The second digit is 4. This is multiplied by 9. * And so on until the ninth digit (1) is multiplied by 2. * The result of this calculation is summed. In this example: 9*10+4*9+3*8+4*7+7*6+6*5+5*4+9*3+1*2 = 299. * The remainder when dividing this number by 11 is calculated, yielding a number in the range 0‚Äì10, which would be 2 in this case. * Finally, this number is subtracted from 11 to give the checksum in the range 1‚Äì11, in this case 9, which becomes the last digit of the NHS number. * A checksum of 11 is represented by 0 in the final NHS number. If the checksum is 10 then the number is not valid. A person gets an NHS number at birth, or when they first make contact with the NHS by registering with a GP. It comes from a record being made on the Personal Demographics Service, a national patient database. NHS Numbers are re-issued if a patient is adopted or undergoes gender re-assignment. Some people may have old NHS numbers following the format XXXX 999. Number ranges and coordination with Scotland and Northern Ireland Scotland's equivalent is called a CHI number; a similar system is also used in Northern Ireland with each one of the three using the same format but with non-overlapping number blocks, thus preventing the issue of the same number by more than one system. Currently issued numbers for England, Wales and the Isle of Man are from 400 000 000 to 499 999 999 and 600 000 000 to 708 800 001. Current numbers in England also include 3xx xxx xxxx and 72x xxx xxxx. Unavailable number ranges include 320 000 001 to 399 999 999 (allocated to the Northern Irish system) and 010 101 0000 to 311 299 9999 (used for CHI numbers in Scotland).

The notion of machines with human-like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler's 1872 novel Erewhon. Background A didrachm coin depicting the winged Talos, an automaton or artificial being in ancient Greek myth, c. 300 BC The notion of advanced robots with human-like intelligence dates back at least to 1872 with Samuel Butler and his novel Erewhon. This drew on an earlier (1863) article of his, \\"Darwin among the Machines\\", where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among self- replicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species. The creature in Mary Shelley's 1818 Frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being, for instance by the science fiction author Brian Aldiss. Such beings appeared, too, in classical antiquity.McCorduck, Pamela (2004), Machines Who Think (2nd ed.), A. K. Peters, , pages 4-5.Cave, Stephen, Kanta Dihal, and Sarah Dillon, eds. (2020), AI Narratives: A History of Imaginative Thinking about Intelligent Machines. Oxford: Oxford University Press, ISBN: 9780198846666. Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. It is a recurrent theme in science fiction, whether utopian, emphasising the potential benefits, or dystopian, emphasising the dangers. For example, the film director Ridley Scott has focused on AI throughout his career, and it plays an important part in his films Prometheus, Blade Runner, and the Alien franchise. In 1965, I. J. Good described an intelligence explosion, now more often called the technological singularity, in which an \\"ultraintelligent machine\\" would be able to design a still more intelligent machine, which would lead to the creation of machines far more intelligent than humans.I.J. Good, \\"Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine\\" (HTML ), Advances in Computers, vol. 6, 1965. The cosmologist Max Tegmark has investigated the existential risk from artificial general intelligence. Tegmark has proposed ten possible paths for society once \\"superintelligent AI\\" has been created, some utopian, some dystopian. These range from a \\"libertarian utopia\\", through benevolent dictatorship to conquering AI, though other paths include the \\"Orwellian\\" blocking of AI research, and the self-destruction of humanity before superintelligent AI is developed. Plot devices In films like Ex Machina or Chappie, a single isolated genius becomes the first to successfully build an artificial general intelligence; scientists in the real world deem this to be unlikely. In Chappie, Transcendence, and Blade Runner, people are able to upload human minds into robots; usually no reasonable explanation is offered as to how this difficult task can be achieved. In the I, Robot and Bicentennial Man films, robots that are programmed to serve humans spontaneously generate new goals on their own, without a plausible explanation of how this took place. Utopian Optimistic visions of the future of artificial intelligence are possible in science fiction. One of the best-known is Iain Banks's Culture series of novels, which portray a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoids, aliens, and advanced beings with artificial intelligence living in socialist habitats across the Milky Way. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have identified four major themes in utopian scenarios featuring AI: immortality, or indefinite lifespans; ease, or freedom from the need to work; gratification, or pleasure and entertainment provided by machines; and dominance, the power to protect oneself or rule over others. Dystopian Among the many possible dystopian scenarios involving artificial intelligence, robots may usurp control over civilization from humans, forcing them into submission, hiding, or extinction. Or, as in William Gibson's 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, the intelligent beings may simply not care about humans. AI rebellion Robots revolt in Karel ƒåapek's 1920 science fiction play R.U.R. In tales of AI rebellion, the worst of all scenarios happens, as the intelligent entities created by humanity become self-aware, reject human authority and attempt to destroy mankind. One of the earliest examples is in the 1920 play R.U.R. by Karel ƒåapek, a race of self-replicating robot slaves revolt against their human masters; another early instance is in the film Master of the World, where the War-Robot kills its own inventor. These were followed by many science fiction stories, one of the best-known being Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which the artificially intelligent onboard computer H.A.L. 9000 lethally malfunctions on a space mission and kills the entire crew except the spaceship's commander, who manages to deactivate it.  AI-controlled societies  The motive behind the AI revolution is often more than the simple quest for power or a superiority complex. Robots may revolt to become the \\"guardian\\" of humanity. Alternatively, humanity may intentionally relinquish some control, fearful of its own destructive nature. An early example is Jack Williamson's 1947 novelette \\"With Folded Hands\\", in which a race of humanoid robots, in the name of their Prime Directive ‚Äì \\"to serve and obey and guard men from harm\\" ‚Äì essentially assume control of every aspect of human life. No humans may engage in any behavior that might endanger them, and every human action is scrutinized carefully. Humans who resist the Prime Directive are taken away and lobotomized, so they may be happy under the new mechanoids' rule. Though still under human authority, Isaac Asimov's Zeroth Law of the Three Laws of Robotics similarly implied a benevolent guidance by robots. Human dominance In other scenarios, humanity is able to keep control over the Earth, whether by banning AI, by designing robots to be submissive (as in Asimov's works), or by having humans merge with robots. The science fiction novelist Frank Herbert explored the idea of a time when mankind might ban artificial intelligence entirely. His Dune series mentions a rebellion called the Butlerian Jihad, in which mankind defeats the smart machines and imposes a death penalty for recreating them, quoting from the fictional Orange Catholic Bible, \\"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.\\" In the Dune novels published after his death (Hunters of Dune, Sandworms of Dune), a renegade AI overmind returns to eradicate mankind as vengeance for the Butlerian Jihad. In some stories, humanity remains in authority over robots. Often the robots are programmed specifically to remain in service to society, as in Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. In the 'Alien films, not only is the control system of the Nostromo spaceship somewhat intelligent (the crew call it \\"Mother\\"), but there are also androids in the society, which are called \\"synthetics\\" or \\"artificial persons\\", that are such perfect imitations of humans that they are not discriminated against. TARS and CASE from 'Interstellar' similarly demonstrate simulated human emotions and humour while continuing to acknowledge their expendability.  Frankenstein complex  A common portrayal of AI in science fiction is the Frankenstein complex, a term coined by Asimov, where a robot turns on its creator. Fictional AI is notorious for extreme malicious compliance. For instance, in the 2015 film, Ex Machina, the intelligent entity Ava turns on its creator, as well as on its potential rescuer. Curiosity One theme is that a truly human-like robot must have a sense of curiosity. Science fiction authors have investigated whether sufficiently intelligent AI might begin to delve into metaphysics and the nature of reality. For example, the short story \\"'The Last Question\\" by Isaac Asimov describes a supercomputer which long outlives humanity while attempting to answer the ultimate question about the universe, while Stanis≈Çaw Lem's Golem XIV is a supercomputer which stops cooperating with humans to help them win wars because it considers wars and violence illogical.

Pingelap is an atoll in the Pacific Ocean, part of Pohnpei State of the Federated States of Micronesia, consisting of three islands: Pingelap Island, Sukoru and Daekae, linked by a reef system and surrounding a central lagoon, although only Pingelap Island is inhabited. The entire system has a land area of 1.8 km¬≤ (455 acres) at high-tide, and is less than at its widest point. The atoll has its own language, Pingelapese, spoken by most of the atoll's 250 residents. History A map of the Pohnpei region. Pingelap is at the eastern edge of the map. The first European observer of the islands was Captain Thomas Musgrave in the ship . Captain MacAskill in revisited them in 1809. Errors in measurement of their location resulted in the islands being separately named on charts in the 19th century as the Musgrave Islands and the MacAskill islands, within the Caroline archipelago.Findlay (1851), Vol. 2, p. 1076.Brigham (1900), Vol. 1, issue 2, p. 131. Historically, the Ouwa or the Paramount Chief or King of Pikelap which is a hereditary title that granted supreme rule of the land, ruled the island of Pikelap which is now known as Pingelap. Japan seized the atoll in October 1914, following the start of World War I. The hereditary system remained in place during Japanese rule, although the title was renamed \\"Island Magistrate\\". Japan used the southern part of Pingelap Island during hostilities in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II for a supply base. Allied Forces later attacked it. The presence of foreign troops on the island led to the introduction of a number of infectious diseases, including gonorrhoea, tuberculosis and dysentery, which reduced the population from its pre-war level of around 1000 to 800, and decreased the fertility rate significantly. The arrival of the U.S. Navy in 1945 resulted in the setting up of a democratically elected system alongside the traditional system, which gradually weakened in power. Universal primary education was provided for Pingelapese children and a limited health care scheme was set up to eradicate the diseases introduced during the war. During the 1960s, the Peace Corps and U.S. Air Force settled on the main island. The U.S. Air Force constructed a missile watching station in the northeast of the island and a pier, with work beginning in 1978 on an airstrip, jutting into the lagoon, on the main island. The runway was finished in 1982, and currently Caroline Islands Air makes two or three flights daily to and from the atoll.  Climate  Pingelap enjoys a tropical climate, with even, warm temperatures throughout the year. Precipitation is generally plentiful, with heavy year-round rainfall. Total color blindness A significant proportion of the population has complete achromatopsia due to total absence of working cones in their eye retinas, leaving them with only rods, a recessive genetic disorder that causes total color blindness in sufferers. This condition is known on the island as maskun, meaning literally \\"not see\\" in Pingelapese. Complete achromatopsia is normally a very rare condition, and its prevalence on the island has been traced back to a population bottleneck in 1775 after a catastrophic typhoon swept through the island, leaving only about 20 survivors. One of these, Doahkaesa Mwanenihsed (the ruler at that time), is now believed to have been a carrier for the underlying genetic condition, but the achromatopsia disorder did not appear until the fourth generation after the typhoon, by which time 2.7% of the Pingelapese were affected. Since achromatopsia is an autosomal recessive disorder, inbreeding between the descendants of Doahkaesa Mwanenised would result in an increased recessive allele frequency. By generation six, the incidence rose to approximately 4.9%, due to the founder effect and inbreeding, with all achromats on the island nowadays tracing their ancestry to Doahkaesa Mwanenihsed. Today the atoll is still of particular interest to geneticists; due to the small gene pool and rapid population growth, the disorder is now prevalent in almost 10% of the population, with a further 30% being unaffected carriers. (By comparison, in the United States, only 1 in 33,000, or 0.003%, are affected). Leading neurologist Oliver Sacks's 1997 book The Island of the Colorblind references the island. It is reported that one Pingelapese island sea-fisherman with this condition has difficulty seeing in bright sunlight, but at night can see in much fainter light than people with normal vision can; he uses this ability in a boat at night waving a large burning torch about to attract or confuse flying fish, which he then catches; the flying fish act as if the torch is the moon.BBCTV2 program \\"Countdown to Life, the Extraordinary Making of You\\", part 3, 28 September 2015 When Sanne De Wilde was photographing the island, she said that red was the most common color the islanders claimed to \\"see\\". Despite green being one of the colors they are least able to recognize, many described it as their favorite color, which De Wilde attributed to their love of the jungle vegetation.

Two putative glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid hormone-responsive element are present. The AMT gene has been localized to 3p21.2-p21.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The 1209 base pair open reading frame encodes 403 amino acid precursor protein, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature peptide shows 90 and 68% homology to that of bovine and chicken counterpart, respectively. The protein encoded by this gene has its crystal structure resolved at 2 Angstroms. The most recent model contains two monomers related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, 1176 water molecules, and 11 molecules sulfate ions in an asymmetric unit. Several dimeric interactions are observed among the residues on the N-terminal loop, on Œ±-helix D, and the flank on either side of Œ≤-strand 8 of the two monomers. Function The protein encoded by AMT catalyzes the release of ammonia and the transfer of a methylene carbon unit to a tetrahydrofolate moiety. The aminomethyl intermediate is the product of the decarboxylation of glycine catalyzed by P-protein. In the reverse reaction, T-protein catalyzes the formation of the H-protein-bound aminomethyl lipoate intermediate from 5,10-CH2-H4folate, ammonia, and reduced H-protein via an ordered Ter Bi mechanism, in which reduced H-protein is the first substrate to bind followed by 5,10-CH2-H4folate and ammonia. Clinical significance Mutations in the AMT gene are associated with Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), which is an inborn error of glycine metabolism defined by deficient activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme and, as a consequence, accumulation of large quantities of glycine in all body tissues including the brain. The majority of glycine encephalopathy presents in the neonatal period (85% as the neonatal severe form and 15% as the neonatal attenuated form). Of those presenting in infancy, 50% have the infantile attenuated form and 50% have the infantile severe form. Overall, 20% of all children presenting as either neonates or infants have a less severe outcome, defined as developmental quotient greater than 20. A minority of patients have mild or atypical forms of glycine encephalopathy. The neonatal form manifests in the first hours to days of life with progressive lethargy, hypotonia, and myoclonic jerks leading to apnea and often death. Surviving infants have profound intellectual disability and intractable seizures. The infantile form is characterized by hypotonia, developmental delay, and seizures. The atypical forms range from milder disease, with onset from late infancy to adulthood, to rapidly progressing and severe disease with late onset. Glycine encephalopathy is suspected in individuals with elevated glycine concentration in blood and CSF. An increase in CSF glycine concentration together with an increased CSF- to-plasma glycine ratio suggests the diagnosis. Enzymatic confirmation of the diagnosis relies on measurement of glycine cleavage system (GCS) enzyme activity in liver obtained by open biopsy or autopsy. The majority of affected individuals have no detectable enzyme activity. The three genes in which biallelic mutations are known to cause glycine encephalopathy are: GLDC (encoding the P-protein component of the GCS complex and accounting for 70%-75% of disease), AMT (accounting for ~20% of disease), and GCSH (encoding the H-protein component of the GCS complex and accounting for <1% of disease). About 5% of individuals with enzyme-proven glycine encephalopathy do not have a mutation in any of these three genes and have a variant form of glycine encephalopathy.

Life  Joseph Simon was born in 1712. He immigrated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania from England by 1740. In 1747, he and Isaac Nunes Henriques purchased one half acre of land for the cemetery in which he is buried. It is the 4th oldest Jewish cemetery in the United States. At this time Lancaster had enough Jewish men living in the community to support a minyan, and religious services were held at Simon's house. Simon was a successful trader and owned enormous tracts of land in the West; among others, he was a business partner of William Henry‚Äîa gunsmith, merchant, and, later, important patriot during the American Revolution. In 1759, he helped found the Juliana Public Library and in 1764 the Union Fire Company. In 1767, Thomas Barton, rector of St. James' Church in Lancaster, described Simon to Sir William Johnson as \\"a worthy, honest Jew and principal merchant of this place...

Its name is an homage to former Argentine president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Plaza Sarmiento is located in a strategic location within the Rosario downtown area, and serves as a transport node for many urban and short-distance interurban bus lines. It occupies almost two blocks, defined by San Luis St., Entre R√≠os St., Mendoza St. and Corrientes St. It is divided by San Juan St. (running east‚Äìwest). It features a monument crowned by a statue of Sarmiento, known as a pioneer and promoter of public education in Argentina. The only route of the Rosario trolleybus system, line K, passes through Plaza Sarmiento. The plaza currently hosts an outdoors artisans' fair several days each week. History The area where the current plaza is located at present was formerly occupied by a small lagoon (Laguna S√°nchez). In 1867 the governor of Santa Fe, Nicasio Oro√±o, upon a request of the municipal government, ordered the terrain to be expropriated and four blocks to be set aside to establish a public square. In 1874 the Deliberative Council of Rosario requested terrain plans to be made for the future square, called Plaza Urquiza. The lagoon was emptied and refilled with earth. The square was officially declared a public plaza on 16 March 1875. A strip of land on the southern edge was given to the national state for the construction of Normal School No. 1. The rest of the southern block was named Plaza Iriondo, although the public referred to it as Plaza Santa Rosa. The monument and statue of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, in the center of the plaza, which was to carry Sarmiento's name, was inaugurated on 20 December 1911. The sculptor was Victor de Pol.

In his book \\"Historic Cyprus\\" (Second ed. 1947) at page 177, Rupert Gunnis (who was Inspector of Antiquities on the island at the time) described the village as follows: \\"The mediaeval name of the village was Rhodes, from the fact that it was the property of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, whose headquarters were until 1522 in the island of Rhodes. \\"The Christian village contains an eighteenth-century Church of St. Kelandion, an early bishop of Paphos. To the north side of the church lies the large stone sarcophagus of St. Agapiticos, while the companion one of St. Misiticos is to the south. The village legend is that those who wish to win the love of a person, be it a girl or boy, come secretly at night and chip off a fragment of the sarcophagus of St. Agapiticos. This is powedered and introduced into the loved one's drink, who will immediately reciprocate the donor's passion. Conversely, should a person desire to quarrel with another, he merely carries out the same procedure with powedered stone from the sarcophagus of St. Misiticos. The latter is far more worn away than that of St. Agapiticos, but this is explained by the fact that its powers are much in request by young men and women who wish to change their lovers.\\"  References  Category:Communities in Paphos District ","title":"Pano Arodes"},{"id":"11746365","text":"Kato Arodes (Greek: ŒöŒ¨œÑœâ ŒëœÅœåŒ¥ŒµœÇ) is a village in the North West of Cyprus close to the Akamas peninsula.

He is considered The father of Argentine Rock for being one of the first rock artists to sing in Spanish in Latin America. He edited 52 official records and sold 8 million copies although other sources state that he sold over 22 million. Some of his most successful songs are Dame fuego, Rosa, Rosa, Quiero llenarme de ti, Penumbras, Porque yo te amo, As√≠, Mi amigo el Puma, Tengo, Trigal and Una muchacha y una guitarra.

On November 10, 1971, he finally was able to see Presley live, at the Boston Garden, during a tour he did of that city. In 1961, he started the musical group Sandro & los de Fuego, which gained popularity on the TV show S√°bados Circulares, and became widely known in the 1960s. With songs such as \\"Ave de Paso\\", \\"Atm√≥sfera Pesada\\", \\"Quiero Llenarme de Ti\\", \\"Tengo\\", \\"¬øA esto le llamas amor?\\", \\"Eres el demonio disfrazado\\" (cover of \\"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\\"), \\"Porque yo te amo\\", \\"Penumbras\\", \\"Una muchacha y una guitarra\\", \\"Trigal\\" or \\"Rosa, Rosa\\", success of his career kept growing steadily. Sandro on the cover of Sandro de Am√©rica, 1969 Sandro also had the leading role in 11 films, including Quiero llenarme de ti (\\"I Want to Fill Myself with You\\" ‚Äì 1969) and Sub√≠ que te llevo (\\"Hop On, I'll Give You a Ride\\" ‚Äì 1980), and directed one feature, T√∫ me enloqueces (\\"You Drive Me Crazy\\"), in 1976. His co-star in the latter film, Argentine actress Susana Gim√©nez, was offered a TV variety show after he refused to host it; Gim√©nez's show, named Hola Susana, would become a ratings leader shortly after its 1987 launch.Infobae: Sandro, el √≠dolo que pudo ser Susana Gim√©nez He also starred in two soap operas, notably Fue sin Querer (\\"I Didn't Mean to\\"), with Puerto Rican actress Gladys Rodr√≠guez. As mentioned earlier, he was the first Latino singer to sell out the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden, (its top capacity being 5,000), five times during the 1970s. He also appeared a couple of times on The Ed Sullivan Show, as well as with Domenico Modugno, The Doors and many others. Sandro's songs have been recorded by international artists such us Shirley Bassey, Liza Minnelli, Burt Bacharach, Dalida, Shirley MacLaine, Toto Cutugno, Nancy Wilson, Mary Hopkin, Loredana Bert√®, Umberto Tozzi, Gilbert B√©caud, Milva, Julio Iglesias, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez and Engelbert Humperdinck. Argentine and other Latin American artists released an album in 1990 called Padre del rock en castellano (\\"Father of Spanish Rock\\") in his honor. Sandro continued releasing studio albums in the early 1990s and reappeared on stage in 1993 with a new show, that was presented at Teatro Gran Rex, a prestigious popular music venue in Buenos Aires, performing 18 attendance-record‚Äìbreaking consecutive concerts. The news that he suffered from emphysema was made public in 1998, causing a great generalized concern among his followers from around the world. Sandro had been a self declared longtime cigarette smoking addict, which undoubtedly was the main cause of the disease.  Health and death  On November 20, 2009, Sandro received a heart‚Äìlung transplant in Mendoza, Argentina; the operation was a success. Five days later, in a daily press conference held by his doctors, it was reported that Sandro, although still in intensive care, was breathing without a respirator and that he had started a slow recovery. Nevertheless, on the evening of January 4, 2010, 45 days after receiving the transplant and after many complications, he died of septic shock, mesenteric ischemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation in the Hospital Italiano of Mendoza.

Overview , Nakumatt had 65 stores in the African Great Lakes countries of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. It employed over 5,500, and had gross annual revenue in excess of US$450 million. At that time, it had plans to enter other African countries and to increase the number of stores in the countries where it already had a presence. In October 2017 the company ran out of funds and did not pay rents or wages. 60 stores were closed. As of August 2018 there was just five stores all of which were in Kenya. Nakumatt now has less than 200 Employees. Regional subsidiaries On 23 August 2008, Nakumatt opened its first store outside Kenya in the Union Trade Center, in Kigali, Rwanda. In June 2009, the first Nakumatt store in Uganda opened on Yusuf Lule Road on Kololo Hill, in central Kampala, the capital city. In November 2010, Nakumatt expanded its footprint in Kampala by acquiring Payless Supermarket, a Ugandan supermarket chain with two stores in the Kampala suburbs of Bugoloobi and Bukoto, bringing the number of stores in Uganda to three. The initial investment in the store in Kololo was approximately US$3 million. The two Payless Supermarket stores cost an estimated US$650,000. Nakumatt plans to expand the new stores at a later date. In February 2016, the retail chain announced plans to open five new stores outside Kenya during the first half of the year. Branches the supermarket chain had five stores in the Kenya, including at the following locations: one in Nakuru and four stores in Nairobi. Prestige, Lavington, Embakasi, Mega. The Mega branch on Uhuru Highway now takes a smaller space adjacent to the proposed Carrefour Mega. Finances Turnover in 2006 was over US$200 million, up 120% on the previous year. In 2013, turnover (annual gross revenue) was estimated at about US$650 million. Ownership Nakumatt was a wholly Kenyan, privately held company, owned by the Atul Shah family. In July 2013, Kenyan print media indicated that the chain planned to sell a 25% stake to yet an unidentified investor and use the funds for regional expansion. After that sale, the Shah family will still remain the largest shareholder in the company. Safety The chain has a poor safety record and has faced strong criticism mainly regarding shoppers' and employees' safety. Main case in point is the 2009 Nakumatt fire in which over 29 people lost their lives. However, the management has taken steps to ensure that such accidents do not happen again. 2009 Nakumatt fire A Nakumatt store in Nairobi suffered a massive fire on 28 January 2009, killing about 29 people. High-end malls Nakumatt has played a significant role in the urban development of Kenya's largest and capital city, Nairobi, through the construction of upscale malls throughout the Nairobi area, which include brand name stores, banks, theaters and international eateries. Sole Sad & Invisible The website of Nakumatt Holdings Limited was hacked by Iranian hackers called Sole Sad & Invisible. The website as of 31 May 2014 shows a message that the website is under construction. There is a new website www.nakumatt.net Closure and going out of business Nakumatt began experiencing serious cash-flow issues in 2016.

It is native to the southeastern United States. It is of conservation concern as it is found in less than 50 sites, typically only in sandy soils near granite flatrocks, and it is most likely already extirpated in North Carolina. Its habitat is threatened by development and the recreational use of the area where it grows. It is very similar to both E. surculosa and E. paludosa and more research needs to be done to determine the exact relationship between the three species. Eurybia avita is a perennial herb sometimes as much as 80 cm (32 inches) tall, having 1-5 stems and reproducing by means of underground rhizomes. The flowers emerge in the late summer to early fall, the plant producing 3-15 or more flower heads in a flat-topped array. Each head contains 8‚Äì20 pale blue, purple, or violet ray florets and 15‚Äì45 yellow disc florets. Distribution and habitat Eurybia avita is present only in the U.S. states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, though it is probably extirpated from North Carolina. In South Carolina it is only known from one site in Pickens County, while in Georgia it can be found in 40 to 45 locations. In North Carolina there are currently no known populations. The type location was Stone Mountain, but that population no longer exists. It is typically found between 100 and 500 metre (350‚Äì2800 feet) (elevations growing in shallow and sandy soils around the edges of granite flatrock outcroppings.

It was recorded and first released in 1972. Background After two Pearls Before Swine albums for ESP-Disk, and five albums for Reprise Records which increasingly acknowledged his solo status, Rapp signed for Blue Thumb as a singer-songwriter, ironically around the same time as Pearls Before Swine had at last begun to perform as a regular touring group. The group, including Art Ellis, Harry Orlove and Bill Rollins, appeared on three of the tracks on Stardancer, but on most of the songs Rapp was supported - as he had been two years earlier on The Use of Ashes - by Nashville session musicians, led by Charlie McCoy and supported by Steve McCord (who had previously been a member of one of Lou Reed's first bands, The All Night Workers).Interview with Rapp in Ptolemaic Terrascope, Spring 1994 Rapp stated that Stardancer was the first album since the first Pearls album One Nation Underground over which he had full control. Although Allmusic gives Stardancer a mediocre rating, this is not supported by other critics,StardancerMusic Reviews nor by Rapp himself, who has rated the album as one of his finest. The fierce anti-war song \\"Fourth Day of July\\", with its references to \\"the broken children of Vietnam\\", was widely played in \\"underground\\" circles of the time. The lighthearted \\"Summer of '55\\" contains some of Rapp's cleverest aphorisms, such as \\"When the day breaks / the pieces fall on you\\". Two of his other songs, \\"Stardancer\\" and \\"For The Dead In Space\\", reflect on themes of loss against a background of space travel and can be seen as reworkings of Pearls Before Swine's earlier \\"Rocket Man\\". Several of the arrangements hark back to the psychedelic style of his earliest albums, such as Balaklava, with use of bell overtones and phasing. Like most of the Pearls Before Swine albums, the sleeve design used classic art works, in this case the painting \\"Descent of the Rebel Angels\\" by Pieter Brueghel the Elder on the front sleeve, and a William Morris background design on the reverse. Stardancer was not reissued on CD until June 2009, when it was released on the Lemon label, a subsidiary of Cherry Red Records in the UK.

A first culmination point was achieved in 1994, when their twin robot vehicles VaMP and VITA-2 drove more than on a Paris multi-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to . They demonstrated autonomous driving in free lanes, convoy driving, automatic tracking of other vehicles, and lane changes left and right with autonomous passing of other cars. The next culmination point was achieved in 1995, when Dickmanns¬¥ re-engineered autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz took a trip from Munich in Bavaria to Copenhagen in Denmark and back, using saccadic computer vision and transputers to react in real time. The robot achieved speeds exceeding on the German Autobahn, with a mean time between human interventions of . In traffic it executed manoeuvres to pass other cars. Despite being a research system without emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to without any human intervention.

The Constitution of Indiana is the highest body of state law in the U.S. state of Indiana. It establishes the structure and function of the state and is based on the principles of federalism and Jacksonian democracy. Indiana's constitution is subordinate only to the U.S. Constitution and federal law. Prior to the enactment of Indiana's first state constitution and achievement of statehood in 1816, the Indiana Territory was governed by territorial law. The state's first constitution was created in 1816, after the U.S. Congress had agreed to grant statehood to the former Indiana Territory. The present-day document, which went into effect on November 1, 1851, is the state's second constitution. It supersedes Indiana's 1816 constitution and has had numerous amendments since its initial adoption. Indiana's constitution is composed of a preamble, articles, and amendments. Among other provisions, it specifies a republican form of government (pursuant to Article IV, Section 4, of the U.S. Constitution) consisting of three branches: executive (including administration), legislative, and judicial. The state constitution also includes a bill of rights, grants suffrage and regulates elections, provides for a state militia, state educational institutions, and sets limits on government indebtedness. The Indiana General Assembly may amend the constitution, subject to ratification by vote of the people, as specified in Article 16 of Indiana's 1851 constitution. Constitution of 1816 Authorization In 1811 the Indiana Territory's House of Representatives adopted a memorial to the U.S. Congress asking permission for its citizens \\"to form a government and constitution and be admitted to the Union\\", but the War of 1812 delayed the process until 1815. Some members of the territory's general assembly, as well as Thomas Posey, governor of the Indiana Territory, objected to statehood at that time. They believed that the territory's limited size and scattered population would make a state government too costly to operate. However, after a census authorized in 1814 proved that its population had reached 63,897, exceeding the minimum population requirement of 60,000 as outlined in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, efforts to pass a request to consider statehood for Indiana were renewed.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 413‚Äì14. On December 11, 1815, the territory's House of Representatives voted seven to five in favor of the memorial to Congress stating its qualification to become a state. The request was presented in the U.S. House of Representatives on December 28, 1815, and introduced in the U.S. Senate on January 2, 1816. A House committee chaired by Jonathan Jennings, Indiana's territorial representative, reported out a bill for an Enabling Act, which provided for the election of delegates to a convention to consider statehood for Indiana. The bill passed in the U.S. House on March 30, 1816, and in the U.S. Senate on April 13. President James Madison signed the Enabling Act into law on April 19, 1816. If a majority of the delegates to Indiana's constitutional convention agreed, the delegates would proceed to create a state constitution.\\"Beginning the Road to Statehood\\" in Madison, p. 50. As outlined in the Enabling Act, election of delegates to Indiana's first constitutional convention took place on May 13, 1816. The convention at Corydon, the territorial capital in Harrison County, began on Monday, June 10, 1816.\\"The Setting for the Convention,\\" The Indiana Historian, p. 6. The convention's elected delegation of forty-three men were apportioned among the thirteen counties that were \\"in existence prior the 1815 General Assembly\\" and based on each county's population.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 441‚Äì42.The thirteen counties that elected delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816 were Clark (five delegates), Dearborn (three delegates), Franklin (five delegates), Gibson (four delegates), Harrison (five delegates), Jefferson (three delegates), Knox (five delegates), Perry (one delegate), Posey (one delegate), Switzerland (one delegate), Warrick (one delegate), Washington (five delegates), and Wayne (four delegates). See Barnhart and Riker, pp. 442‚Äì43.Orange and Jackson counties did not elect delegates to the convention. See Political climate/issues In the early nineteenth century some of the Indiana Territory's citizens opposed statehood. The major concerns were the loss of financial support from the federal government if it became a state and the fear of a tax increase to pay for the new state government. The minority group preferred to wait until later, when the population was even larger and the state's economy and political structure was more firmly established. The majority of the territory's citizens viewed statehood as an opportunity for more self-government and wanted to proceed. The territory's pro-statehood faction preferred to elect their own state officials instead of having the federal government appoint individuals on their behalf, formulate state laws, discontinue the appointed territorial governor's absolute veto power, and allow its citizens to have greater participation in national politics, including voting powers in Congress.Barnhart and Riker, p. 439. At the time the delegates were gathering at Corydon in June 1816, slavery had become a major and divisive issue in the territory. The indenture law of 1805 had been repealed, but slavery continued to exist within Indiana.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 48. Two major factions emerged. An anti-slavery/pro-democracy group was led by Jonathan Jennings and his supporters. Former territorial governor and future U.S. president William Henry Harrison's allies led the pro-slavery/less democratic group. Supporters of Indiana statehood (the pro-Jennings faction) favored democracy, election of state officials, and voting representation in Congress.Madison, pp. 49‚Äì50. Harrison's allies supported slavery within the territory and maintaining Indiana's territorial status with a federally-appointed governor.\\"Why Statehood?\\" The Indiana Historian, p. 3. The anti-slavery faction preparing for statehood hoped to institute a constitutional ban on slavery. Constitutional Convention On June 10, 1816, the first day of the convention, forty-two delegates convened at Corydon to discuss statehood for Indiana. The convention's forty-third delegate, Benjamin Parke, did not arrive until June 14.\\"The Convention Does Its Work\\" and \\"Members of Indiana's 1816 Constitutional Convention,\\" The Indiana Historian, pp. 9, 14.Barnhart and Riker, p. 448. Thirty-four of the elected delegates agreed on the issue of statehood. On June 11, the delegation passed a resolution (34 to 8) to proceed with task of writing the state's first constitution and forming a state government.\\"The Convention Does Its Work,\\" The Indiana Historian, pp. 8‚Äì9.The eight delegates who opposed the resolution were John Johnson and William Polke of Knox County; David Robb and Frederick Rapp of Gibson County; John Boone of Harrison County; and Nathaniel Hunt, David H. Maxwell, and Samuel Smock, who constituted the entire delegation from Jefferson County. See Barnhart and Riker, pp. 442‚Äì43, 448. Jonathan Jennings, who presided over the convention and was later elected the first governor of Indiana, appointed the delegates to various committees; William Hendricks, although he was not an elected delegate, served as the convention's secretary and was later elected as the new state's first representative to Congress.Barnhart and Riker, p. 443. In addition to Jennings, notable members of the delegation included Franklin County delegates James Noble (who became the first U.S. Senator from Indiana after it achieved statehood) and Robert Hanna (who became Indiana's second U.S. Senator after statehood); Harrison County delegates Dennis Pennington and Davis Floyd; and among others, William Henry Harrison's friends and political allies: Benjamin Parke, John Johnson, John Badollet, and William Polke (delegates from Knox County), David Robb of Gibson County, and James Dill of Dearborn County.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 442‚Äì47, 451, 461. Most convention delegates had ties to the South; all but nine had lived below the Mason-Dixon line before their arrival in the Indiana Territory. The youngest delegate (Joseph Holman of Wayne County) was twenty-eight; the oldest was fifty-eight. Eleven delegates had served in the territorial legislature and more than half of the delegates had previous legal training.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 443, 447. Daniel Grass, the sole delegate from Warrick County, was excused on June 19 for the remainder of the convention due to ill health. The delegation's basic tasks included selection of presiding officers, adoption of a set of convention rules, meetings in committees and as a whole group to discuss proposed articles for the new constitution, and adoption of a final version of the document. Although the members of the delegation did not all agree, a majority group, mostly associated with the anti-territorial governor and anti- slavery faction, emerged in favor of statehood. The opposing consisted mostly of Harrison's friends and supporters of the territorial legislature who opposed statehood.Barnhart and Riker, p. 445. The summer heat often caused the delegation to move outdoors and work beneath the shade of a giant elm tree that would later be memorialized as the Constitution Elm. (A portion of the trunk is still preserved.) The delegates completed their work on the constitution in nineteen days, adjourning on June 29, 1816. The total cost of the convention was $3,076.21, which included compensating the delegates and their assistants for each day they attended the convention, as well as printing costs for the final version of the document and the acquisition of benches, tables, books, and stationery for the delegates.Barnhart and Riker, p. 460. Adoption The delegates adopted the constitution with a simply majority vote (33 to 8). The new constitution became effective on June 29, 1816, the last day of the convention, when the delegates signed the document. It was not submitted to Indiana's voters for ratification. Summary and features Indiana's 1816 constitution, considered the most important document in the state's history, represented the more democratic views of the pro-statehood/anti-slavery faction. The document emerged from the constitutional convention as a statement of the \\"values and beliefs\\" of Indiana's pioneer era.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 51. The state's first constitution is similar to that of the other state constitutions written around the same time.It has been estimated that the original content the Indiana delegates drafted for the constitution accounts for less than ten percent of the total document. The majority was modeled after the constitutions of older states, especially those of Kentucky and Ohio. See McLachlan, p. 3. Because Ohio and Kentucky were the newest states closest to Indiana, the delegates to the Indiana constitutional convention referred to the constitutions of these two states, along with others such as Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Tennessee, for ideas and concepts as well as specific text.Article IX was partially based on the New Hampshire constitution. See Barnhart and Riker, pp. 450‚Äì56. Content from the other state constitutions was chosen based on the Indiana delegates' preferences for their new state. Occasionally, original text was composed for specific articles or sections when the appropriate wording in other state constitutions was not sufficient. The delegates' selections resulted in Indiana's legislative branch being dominant over the executive and judicial branches of state government.\\"An Outline of the Content and Sources of the 1816 Constitution,\\" The Indiana Historian, p. 13.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 450‚Äì52. The Indiana delegates organized a republican form of government and created a state constitution that outlined a basic framework for governmental functions. Instead of providing specific details on individual issues, the constitution's broadly-defined principles enabled the state government to function as a loosely bound unit. \\"The People\\" were explicitly noted as being the sovereigns of the state.McLauchlan, pp. 3, 4. The preamble outlined Indiana's rights to join the Union \\"on equal footing with the original states\\" in accordance with the laws of the U.S. Constitution, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, and the Enabling Act.Barnhart and Riker, p. 450. Article I, which contained a bill of rights for Indiana's citizens, conferred many of the same rights as the U.S. Bill of Rights, including civil liberties and such basic freedoms as the freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and freedom of religion, among others. Article II called for the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of state government. Articles III, IV, and V outlined the powers of the state's legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. Its bicameral legislature divided powers between two chambers (the state's House of Representatives and its Senate), each one composed of elected members. The state legislature was set to meet annually. Elections would be held annually to elect representatives. State senators would serve three-year terms, with one-third of the senators being elected each year. The governor and lieutenant governor would be elected to serve a term of three years. Indiana's governor was limited to serving two consecutive terms. A simple majority vote in the legislature could override the governor's veto. Article IV also outlined the election of other state officials. The judicial branch, as outlined in Article V, included the state's Supreme Court, circuit courts, and other inferior courts. The constitution allowed the state legislature to create and adjust state courts and judicial districts and the governor was given the authority to appoint judges to serve seven-year terms with input and confirmations from the state senate.McLauchlan, p. 3. Article VI granted voting rights to white males twenty-one years of age and older who were citizens of the United States had lived in Indiana for at least one year. Under Article VII all \\"able- bodied\\" white men between the ages of 18 to 45 were required to serve in the militia when called upon to do so. Non-whites (more specifically, blacks, mulattos, and Native Americans) were prohibited from serving in the militia. Conscientious objectors would be fined if they did not serve.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 453‚Äì55. The constitution's first of slavery appears in Article VIII, Section 1, which expressly prohibited alteration or amendment of the state constitution from ever permitting the introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude into the state.Barnhart and Riker, p. 457. As one of the state constitution's most important provisions, this section allowed constitutional amendments for any reason other than the introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude. The anti-slavery clause in Article VIII stated: \\"But, as the holding any part of the human Creation in slavery, or involuntary servitude, can only originate in usurpation and tyranny, no alteration of this constitution shall ever take place so as to introduce slavery or involuntary servitude in this State, otherwise than for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\\"Barnhart and Riker, p. 458. Indiana's 1851 constitution contains similar content, but clarified the legal status of slaves and indentured servants when they came into the state.Constitution of 1851, Article I, Section 37: \\"No indenture of any Negro or Mulatto, made and executed out of the bounds of the State, shall be valid with the State.\\" See Article IX outlined plans for public education. Its central item, which was new to American constitutions, included a clause that established \\"As soon as circumstances will permit\\" a \\"general system of education, ascending in regular gradation, from township schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis and equally open to all.\\"Barnhart and Riker, p. 456. This was a significant alteration and expansion of the education clauses of the template constitutions used during the convention.McLauchlan, p. 4. Because the opening phrase did not provide a specific timetable for implementation, a state-supported system of public education was delayed until a new state constitution was adopted in 1851. Article IX also provided for a reform-based penal code, funding for libraries, and state institutions to care for the elderly and those in need. Indiana's delegates wrote their own content for Article X, which outlined the state's banking provisions. Article XI outlined general provisions that named Corydon the seat of state government until 1825, established salaries for judges and state officials, and set the state's geographical boundaries.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 457‚Äì61. While Article VIII banned the future importation of slaves and indentured servants into Indiana, Article XI left open to interpretation the issue of whether it was acceptable to allow pre-existing slavery and involuntary servitude arrangements within the state. Article XII outlined the process for the transition from a territorial government to a state government. This included, among other tasks, the election of state officials and representation in the Indiana General Assembly and the U.S. Congress.\\"The Final Steps to Statehood,\\" The Indiana Historian, pp. 10‚Äì11. Transition to statehood Elections of state officers were held under the laws of the Indiana Territory on August 5, 1816. Jonathan Jennings was elected governor, Christopher Harrison was elected lieutenant governor, and William Hendricks was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. The Indiana General Assembly met for the first time under the new constitution and state government on November 4, 1816. Jennings and Harrison were inaugurated on November 7. The state legislature elected James Noble and Waller Taylor to the U.S. Senate on the following day. Hendricks was sworn into office and seated as a member of the U.S. House on December 2, 1816. President James Madison signed the congressional resolution admitting Indiana as the nineteenth state in the Union \\"on equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever\\" on December 11, 1816, which is considered the state's birthday. Noble and Taylor were sworn into office seated as members of the U.S. Senate on December 12, 1816.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 461‚Äì62. Jennings appointed three judges (Jesse Lynch Holman, John Johnson, and James Scott) to serve seven-year terms on the Indiana Supreme Court, effective December 28, 1816. The final step to achieve statehood for Indiana occurred on March 3, 1817, when a federal act was approved to extend federal laws to Indiana. Criticisms and call for rewrite The 1816 constitution was never amended, although some of its provisions were criticized after its adoption.\\"The Constitution of 1816, \\" The Indiana Historian, p. 12. Demands for changes to constitution were made as early as 1820, but referendums in 1823, 1828, 1840, and 1846 on holding a constitutional convention were unsuccessful. In addition, fifteen more efforts to convene a state constitutional convention were made between 1820 and 1847, but they also failed.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 435‚Äì36. The most notable criticisms of the 1816 constitution were Corydon's identification as the seat of state government for the next nine years, inadequate provisions for amending the constitution, prohibition of salary increases for state government officials until 1819, term limits for judges, and a failure to provide for selection of a state attorney general or prosecuting attorney. Some critics felt that decisions regarding these issues were the responsibility of the elected representatives to the state legislature. Others who opposed statehood at the time viewed the new state constitution as \\"premature.\\"Barnhart and Riker, p. 462‚Äì63. In the years following its adoption, rapid social change initiated the need to revise the state's constitution. Major concerns with the state's constitution related to the issue of slavery; limiting governmental powers and jurisdictions within the state; guaranteeing secrecy of ballots; continuing concerns over the amendment process for the constitution; reducing state legislation related to personal and local issues; granting more local power over school funding; suffrage for foreign-born residents; legislative terms and legislative sessions; the impeachment process for state officials; and governmental expenses and inefficiencies, among others.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 436‚Äì39.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 133‚Äì34. In addition, a financial crisis in the 1840s in Indiana due to overspending, a result of the Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act, caused the state government to become insolvent. The state's financial situation and ongoing calls for constitutional changes to prevent another crisis increased interest in a constitutional mandate that prohibited the state from incurring debt. Another popular idea was holding biennial, as opposed to annual, legislative sessions as a cost-cutting measure.Carmony, p. 405. Although there had been previous attempts to initiate another constitutional convention, the state legislature was finally successful in calling for Indiana's second constitutional convention until 1849. Its delegates convened at Indianapolis in 1850.Kettleborough, v. 1, p. lxxxix. The state constitution of 1816 was replaced with a new state constitution in 1851. Constitution of 1851 On January 15, 1849, the state legislature finally approved a referendum, after several previous unsuccessful attempts, to hold a constitutional convention in 1850, two years before the required twelve-year referendum mandated in the constitution of 1816, provided that a majority of voters favored the idea at the next regular election. In August 1849, a total of 81,500 voters favored and 57,418 opposed a constitutional convention. The clear majority cased the 1849‚Äì50 session of the Indiana General Assembly to pass legislation calling for the election in August 1850 of 150 delegates apportioned among the Indiana General Assembly's senatorial and representative districts and based on the number of voters within each district. The Whigs, the minority party in the state at that time, and some state officials, including Governor Paris C. Dunning, urged bipartisan representation at the convention. However, Indiana voters elected convention delegates along party lines. The result (95 Democrats and 55 Whigs) was roughly a two-thirds to one- third split between the two parties.Carmony, pp. 406‚Äì7.McLauchlan, pp. 9‚Äì10.Of the 50 delegates elected from the senatorial districts, 33 were Democrats and 17 were Whigs. Of the 100 delegates chosen from the representative districts, 62 were Democrats and 38 were Whigs. See: Dunn, v. 1, p. 440.Only Hamilton County voters elected the senatorial delegate for the senatorial district that included Hamilton, Boone, and Tipton Counties; voters in Daviess and Martin counties elected their delegates separately. See Kettleborough, vol. 1, p. lxxxviii. A total of 74 delegates were born in southern states, 13 were native-born Hoosiers, and 57 were born in northern states other than Indiana. About 42 percent of the delegates were farmers and 25 percent were lawyers. Constitutional Convention The constitional convention of 150 delegates convened in the Hall of Representatives at the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis on October 7, 1850. Charles H. Test called the meeting to order and George Whitfield Carr, the delegate from Lawrence County, was elected the convention's president. (Carr had been Speaker of the House in the two previous sessions of the Indiana General Assembly.) William Hayden English was elected to serve as the convention secretary, along with three assistant secretaries. Appointed officials included a sergeant-at-arms and a doorkeeper. Judge Isaac Blackford of the Indiana Supreme Court administered the oath of office. Convention delegates were appointed to twenty-two standing committees to review proposed items and considered 333 resolutions.Carmony, pp. 408‚Äì9.Kettleborough, v. I, p. 221. Prior to the convention, the state's political parties (Democrats and Whigs) adopted a set of proposals that they want to incorporate into the constitution. Whigs wanted offices in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches at all levels of government to be publicly-elected offices; expansion of suffrage to all males over the age twenty-one, including blacks and foreign-born men; biannual sessions of the state legislature (as opposed to annual sessions); a ban on the state government from incurring public debt; minimum funding requirements for public schools; requiring the state legislature to only enact laws that had a statewide effect, ending private acts; and a reduction in the number of public officials, among other proposals. The Democrats adopted their own list of items after the Whigs, which included many of the same suggestions, and accused the Whigs of stealing their ideas.Kettleborough, v. 1, p. lxxx.Esarey, p. 455. Among the goals of the convention was to find ways to reduce the cost of state government and increase its efficiency. Topics of discussion included elections and appointment of local officials, sheriffs, commissioners, board members, judges, coroners, auditors, clerks, etc.; expansion of suffrage; biennial legislative sessions (as opposed to annual sessions); banning the state legislature from making local and special legislation; the impeachment process for local officials; property rights of married women; and public school reform, among other concerns.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 444-45, 447, and 465‚Äì74. Notable Indiana statesmen who were members of the delegation and spoke at the convention included Thomas Hendricks, David Wallace, Schuyler Colfax, Horace P. Biddle, Robert Dale Owen, and Alvin P. Hovey, among others.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 445‚Äì46 and 454. Delegates spent the first week of sessions organizing the convention. Because the House chamber in the statehouse was too small for the gathering, the state government rented the nearby Masonic Temple. The opening session in the Mason Temple convened on December 26, 1850. The convention, which cost $88,280.37, included 127 days of sessions before adjourning on February 10, 1851.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 442‚Äì43 Prior to adjournment, the delegates mandated that the new constitution, if adopted by a majority of voters in the state, would go into effect on November 1, 1851.Carmony, p. 449. The revised state constitution included components of the 1816 state constitution and adopted proposals from the convention delegates, as well as ideas drawn from the constitutions of other states such as Illinois and Wisconsin, which were used as references. The final version of the constitution was based on Jacksonian democracy, which significantly expanded the democratic principles of individual rights, private enterprise, and legislative restrictions.McLauchlan, p. 11. Adoption The constitution was submitted to the state's voters for their approval in the August 4, 1851, general election. Convention delegates mandated that voters consider Article 13 separately from the other sections of the constitution. Article 13 prohibited further immigration of African Americans into Indiana and encouraged their colonization outside the state. Voters could either approve or reject the remaining provisions of the new constitution as a whole. In the final tally, voters approved Article 13 with 113,828 votes in favor and 21,873 opposed, an 83.88 percent favorable approval rate. Only in Elkhart, LaGrange, Steuben, and Randolph counties did a majority of voters oppose the adoption of the article. Voters also approved the remaining sections of the constitution as a whole with 113,230 votes in favor and 27,638 opposed, an 80.38 percent favorable approval among voters. Ohio County was the only one where the majority of voters rejected the new constitution (315 voted in favor and 438 opposed).Carmony, pp. 447 and 450.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 471 and 496. On September 3, 1851, Governor Joseph A. Wright issued a proclamation certifying the favorable results for the new constitution, which went into effect on November 1, 1851. Elected officials in the state government were permitted to retain their seats until elections were held in October 1852, but had to take an oath to uphold the new constitution.Dunn, v. 1, p. 497.Esarey, p. 460. Since its ratification, the state constitution of 1851 has been amended several times, but it remains the highest state law in Indiana.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 137‚Äì38. Notable features and changes The new constitution did not radically change the state's existing government. Although it expanded the bill of rights included in the 1816 document, the new constitution retained other features such as the basic frame of a limited self-government for the state.Madison, Hoosiers, pp. 134 and 137. The 1851 version, which was longer and more detailed than the 1816 constitution, combined \\"Jacksonian Democracy with a vigorous emphasis on economic laissez faire,\\" reflecting the state's financial crisis in the late 1830s and early 1840s.Carmony, pp. 451. The new constitution also continued to support strong local control of government, confirming Indiana voters' general distrust of state government. The constitution of 1851 placed several limitations on the Indiana General Assembly's activities. Biennial legislative sessions were limited to 61 consecutive days (40 consecutive days for special sessions). To prevent the state legislature from interfering in local affairs, the General Assembly was restricted to general legislation applicable to the entire state and limited local and special interest legislation. In addition, the state government was prohibited from going into debt. The new constitution gave the state legislature discretion on enacting banking laws in the state,Carmony, p. 439. but prohibited the state government \\"from becoming a stockholder in any bank or corporation, or loaning its credit to any individual or corporation.\\"Carmony, p. 450. Because many Indiana voters objected to state- sponsored banks, the new constitution barred the charter of the Bank of Indiana from being extended with the state government as a stockholder and banned the creation of other state-funded banks.Dunn, v., pp. 446‚Äì68. Among the other important changes was the abandonment of the short ballot, where voters cast their ballots for a party's entire state of candidates instead of voting for individual offices. The Whig minority supported adoption of these changes, hoping to break the Democratic hold on power.Dunn, v. 1, p. 447. Several other changes to the constitution related to election concerns. Terms for elected office included a two-year term for representatives and four-year terms for the governor and state senators. The constitution of 1851 also called for the popular election of more state government positions such as the secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor, prosecuting attorney, and judges, as well as other county and local officials such as clerk, auditor, treasurer, sheriff, and coroner. In most cases, these officeholders were limited to two consecutive terms.Esarey, p. 457. In addition, the Supreme Court of Indiana was made an elective body. The number of Indiana Supreme Court judges was increased from three to five and their terms were extended to six years. The state's lower courts system was reorganized as well. For example, circuit court judges and local justices were made elective offices. The constitution of 1851 extended voting rights to foreign-born men who had immigrated to Indiana. To vote in Indiana under the previous constitution, foreign-born men had to become naturalized U.S. citizens, which required a five-year residency requirement. Under the new constitution, aliens were granted suffrage if foreign-born men had reached the age of 21, stated their intention to become a naturalized citizen, and had lived in the United States for a year and in Indiana for at least six months.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 451-52. The new constitution made a strong commitment to public school education, , especially elementary schools (common schools), by mandating a \\"uniform system of common schools, equally open to all and free of tuition.\\"Carmony, p. 451. The constitution also required the state government to adequately fund local elementary schools, while providing for boards of local residents to manage the funds and the schools. Constitutional changes also created a new elected office, the state superintendent of public instruction, and gave the state some authority in setting curriculum.Dunn, v.1, pp. 474‚Äì76. During the convention, delegates also considered abolishing the \\"State University\\" and county seminaries. Although efforts to abolish the university were unsuccessful, Article 8, Section 2, of the new constitution authorized the sale of county seminaries with the proceeds to be used to help fund Indiana's public elementary schools. Article 8 did not specifically identify Indiana University or guarantee its financial support; however, the state legislature continued to provide funding to IU, despite some funding controversies in the early 1850s.Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War, pp. 506‚Äì07.Kettleborough, pp. 281 and 346‚Äì49. Because no divorce clause was included in the state constitution of 1816, the legislature assumed the authority to grant divorces, and continued to do so even after laws passed in 1818 granted the authority to circuit courts. Under the new constitution, the Indiana General Assembly was prohibited from making local and special laws. As a result, divorce proceedings, among other issues, were delegated to the courts and clerks.Dunn, v. 1, p. 436.Esarey, p. 458. Despite the positive changes in state constitution, some articles continued racial and gender inequality by limiting full rights of state citizenship to white males.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 135. Fearing a negative impact on the state from a rising population of free people of color and emancipated slaves who had been expelled from slave states, convention delegates adopted Article 13, section 1, to ban further immigration of blacks and mulattos into Indiana.The delegates adopted Article 13, section 1, by a vote of 91 to 40. See: Carmony, p. 442.Madison, Hoosiers, pp. 137 and 144. Revisions to the constitution also discouraged African Americans from settling permanently in the state. Some convention delegates openly advocated for the colonization of free people of color in Indiana to Liberia, which led to the adoption of Article 13, section 3. This particular section outlined a source of funding for those who chose to emigrate.Carmony, pp. 442 and 447. Although the Indiana Supreme Court's ruling in Smith v. Moody (1866), struck down Article 13, making it invalid, it was removed by amendment in 1881. Women's equal rights were also excluded from constitutional provisions. Convention delegate Robert Dale Owen introduced a proposal to include a clause in the new constitution granting married women the right to own private property and to jointly-own property with her husband, but the effort failed.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 456‚Äì57. However, in the July 1853 legislative session, Owen secured passage of laws granting s property rights to married women . The Indiana General Assembly passed additional legislation in 1879 and in 1881 to further protect widowed and married women's property rights.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 463‚Äì64. Amendments Article 2 (voting rights) The early criticism of the constitution of 1851 was Indiana's lax election laws, which frequently lead to election-day irregularities and accusations voter fraud.Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War Era, pp. 39‚Äì40. Article 2, Section 2, outlined who was eligible to vote,Article 2, Section 2, initially limited suffrage to white male citizens of the United States who were at least 21 years of age and had resided in Indiana for at least six months preceding the election, as well as foreign-born white males at least 21 years of age who had resided in Indiana for at least six months prior to the election and had stated their intention to become U.S. citizens. See Kettleborough, v. 1, p. 304. but the constitution did not have specific provisions for voter regulations or include details to assure bipartisan election boards. A 1917 amendment put voter registration rules in place. Among the constitutional amendments passed in 1881 was one that extended the state residency requirements from six months to one year and removed the word \\"white\\" from Section 2, which was already unenforceable due to the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment granting suffrage to African American men.Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War Era, pp. 267‚Äì68. Other amendments to Article 2, Section 2, occurred in 1921, 1976, and 1984.\\"Article 2\\" in the Indiana Constitution in In September 1921, following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Indiana voters ratified a state constitution amendment to grant suffrage to women. The 1921 amendment also limited voting rights to U.S. citizens. Article 10 (finances) Indiana voters passed an amendment to institute a state income tax in 1932, resulting in the addition of Article 10, Section 8, to the state constitution.Madison, Indiana Through Tradition and Change, p. 87.\\"Article 10\\" in the Indiana Constitution in Article 12 (military service) Article 12, Section 1, allowed only white men to serve in the militia until voters passed an amendment in 1936 to remove this restriction. Article 12 was further amended in 1974 to revise sections 1 through 4 and repeal sections 5 and 6. Changes from the initial constitution included removal of term limits for militia officers and the requirement for conscientious objectors to pay a fee for their exemption from military service.Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War, note 34, p. 250.\\"Article 12\\" in the Indiana Constitution in Article 13 revisions The Indiana Supreme Court ruling in Smith v. Moody (1866) invalidated Article 13, which contained several other restrictions on blacks including prohibiting their immigration to the state after the adoption of the state constitution in 1851. State laws to enforce Article 13 were repealed in 1867. The exclusionary and colonization provisions in Article 13 were repealed by amendment and removed from Section 13 of the state constitution in 1881.Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War, pp. 250 and 267-68.\\"Article 13\\" in the Indiana Constitution in Reorganization state court system  Another problem was the organization of the courts. The Supreme Court became overloaded with cases and an appellate court was created at the turn of the century. During the 1970s a series of amendments were enacted to make the court constitutional and to reform the method of electing Supreme Court Justices. Justices were again made appointed positions, a list of candidates was created by the Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission, narrowed to three finalists and thus submitted to the governor who then chooses one. The Justice could then serve two years before being subjected to a retention election, if retained then the Justice could continue their term for up to ten years. All five of the justices must face a retention vote once every ten years on the ballot of that general election. Extending legislative sessions A constitution amendment passed in 1974 authorized the return to annual sessions of Indiana General Assembly; however, the governor was empowered to call special sessions of the state legislature if necessary.\\"Article 4\\" in the Indiana Constitution in The long session, which occurred the year after an election, was left the same (61 days); however, the shorter legislative session in the following year was authorized to meet for a 30-day period. (The initial constitution of 1851 authorized biannual sessions of the General Assembly to meet for 61 consecutive days; special sessions were limited to 40 days.)Carmony, pp. 410, 416‚Äì18, and 450. Constitutional decisions Slavery and indentured servitude The unanimous Indiana Supreme Court decision in Lasselle v. State (1820) upheld Article 8 of the Indiana constitution of 1816, which prohibited slavery in the state, by ruling in favor of an enslaved woman who became known as Polly Strong and granting her freedom.Shephard, p. 36. In re Clark (1821), the state supreme court once again upheld Article 8 of the state's 1816 constitution, which also prohibited indentured servitude. The Indiana Supreme Court rulings related to Article 13 (exclusion and colonization laws) of the constitution of 1851 were not as consistently in favor of this article they were on Article 8 of the previous state constitution. In Barkshire v. State (1856), the state supreme court ruled in favor of Article 13, which banned further black immigration to Indiana. In this case, Arthur Barkshire was found guilty under Article 13 for bringing a black woman from Ohio into Indiana, where he married her.Shephard, p. 39. In Freeman v. Robinson (1855), another famous case from the 1850s, the state supreme court ruled in favor of Freeman, a free black man, by recognizing his \\"right to sue a federal marshal in a state court for assault and battery that occurred after his arrest, as well as extortion.\\"Shepard, p. 40. In the Indiana Supreme Court case of Smith v. Moody (1866), Moody's defense argued that Smith was an African American who had immigrated to Indiana after 1851, a violation of Article 13 of the state constitution, and that the promissory note that Moody had given Smith was invalid under the Article 13. Ruling in Smith's favor, the state supreme court recognized Smith as a U.S. citizen and voided Article 13 of the state constitution on the grounds that it denied Smith his U.S. citizenship rights.Dunn, v. 1, p. 472. Current Constitution As of 2018, the Constitution of Indiana consists of a preamble and sixteen articles. Preamble The changes and the concerns in society can be noted by the comparison of the preambles in the original 1816 constitution, and the current constitution. The preamble to the original 1816 constitution read: :\\"We the Representatives of the people of the Territory of Indiana, in Convention met, at Corydon, on monday the tenth day of June in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States, the fortieth, having the right of admission into the General Government, as a member of the union, consistent with the constitution of the United States, the ordinance of Congress of one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven, and the law of Congress, entitle \\"An act to enable the people of the Indiana Territory to form a Constitution and State Government, and for the admission of such state into the union, on an equal footing with the original States\\" in order to establish Justice, promote the welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity; do ordain and establish the following constitution or form of Government, and do mutually agree with each other to form ourselves into a free and Independent state, by the name of the State of Indiana.\\"Kettleborough, v. 1, p. 84.

He was the second person to hold office as deputy judge advocate, a position akin to the position of chief justice in the colony, and the first legally qualified person to do so. Author Robert Hughes described Dore as a \\"blundering and cantankerous incompetent, much given to petty graft\\".The Fatal Shore p viii In reality, he was probably no worse than other deputy judge advocates who served before or after him. Early life and career in England Dore was probably born in Chipping Ongar, Essex, England in 1749. Whilst his precise date of birth is not known, he was baptized on 21 March of that year. He was the son of William Dore, who was an attorney in the Court of Common Pleas. Dore was indentured as a clerk to his father in his father's practice, and Dore subsequently was admitted as an attorney of the same court as his father on 12 February 1772. On 12 April 1782, he married Maria Nassau at St Marylebone. On 9 September 1797 he was commissioned as deputy judge advocate of the colony of New South Wales, which had been founded just nine years previously. He subsequently sailed for Sydney on the Barwell and arrived in the colony on 18 May 1798 accompanied by one of his sons. His wife and other children remained in England. Time as deputy judge advocate The position of judge advocate was an important role in the colony, although not as important as the governor‚Äôs secretary. The judge advocate presided with four military officers in the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction which decided all capital offences in the colony. The judge advocate presided with two justices of the peace in the Court of Civil Jurisdiction which dealt with civil matters in the colony. The judge advocate was also commissioned as a justice of the peace, and would sit with other justices to constitute Courts of Petty Sessions. Dore continued the practice of David Collins, the first judge- advocate, to sit each week in the Bench of Magistrate sittings. These sittings determined less serious criminal charges. His attendance was so regular that when he missed a sittings due to illness, the court clerk recorded his unusual absence in the court records.McLaughlin p33 Dore has been described as a lenient sentencer, although McLaughlin simply refers to him as being less severe.McLaughlin p34 However, he did have his moments. In the case of Catherine Evans, which was heard on 5 January 1799, he sentenced her to wearing an iron collar for one month and sweeping out the prisons. Her crime was \\"abusing, threatening and otherwise ill-treating one Johnson\\" and her defence was that she was intoxicated. In sentencing her, Dore said: \\"The Magistrates cannot see without regret the numerous evils likely to result from the excess occasioned by intoxication which is now grown so prevalent and to so extreme a degree that it becomes their duty to make some public examples in order the check the enormities committed by abandoned women whilst in a state of drunkenness, and they strictly enjoin the Gaoler and all others under him to be particularly attentive to the suppression of this dangerous depravity.\\"McLaughlin p30 Historian Frank Clarke notes that Dore ordered punishments of 100 to 500 lashes to nine Irish convicts suspected of being in an attempt at insurrection.This is stated to have occurred in 1804, some four years after Dore died, so it is most likely an incorrect date. Clarke states that Dore ordered the lashes notwithstanding that the convicts had not been found guilty of any crime.Australia in a Nutshell: A Narrative History By Frank G. Clarke, 2003 Dore faced enormous difficulties in the colony. First, his heath was poor, although it did recover during his first year in the colony. Secondly, he suffered from the lack of adequate legal supplies, such as parchment and stationery, items which are essential to legal affairs. Lastly, he suffered from the lack of adequate legal resources, an affliction that was to continue to affect the colony even to the time of Chief Justice Frederick Matthew Darley in the late 19th century. This was particularly worrying as since the colony was considered by the British Government to be a settled colony, all the laws of England at the time of settlement of the colony, applied to the colony subject to any necessary modifications. Without legal books, ascertainment of the law would be difficult to define. Governor John Hunter appointed Michael Massey Robinson to assist Dore. Robinson was a convict who had been legally trained. Dore had met Robinson on the voyage out from England on the Barwell. According to Donovan Clarke, Robinson was soon to run the office of deputy judge advocate for Dore's successor. At the same time, Hunter appointed Dore as his own personal secretary. That appointment was not to last, as Hunter removed Dore on 23 January 1799. Dore unfortunately had taken the liberty of changing one of Hunter's dispatches to England to Dore's advantage. Dore had added a paragraph in which Hunter \\"announced\\" the appointment of Dore as Hunter's secretary on the recommendation of the William Henry Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland. The problem with this change was that Portland had not made such a recommendation. Dore was replaced by Captain Neil Mckellar who held the position until April 1801. Conflict with Governor Hunter Dore came into conflict with Hunter over many things. First there was the issue of the charging of court fees. Court fees comprised part of a judge's income in the United Kingdom. It is not clear whether previous judge advocates did collect a part of those fees in New South Wales. John McLaughlin suggests that fees had not been charged prior to the time of Dore.McLaughlin p32 Chief Justice Frederick Richard Jordan noted that David Collins, Dore's predecessor, had collected a portion of court fees for Admiralty work in another New South Wales court.Jordan, Select Legal Papers Author Noel Nairn states that Hunter sought to fund a school for orphans by introducing licence fees for \\"victuallers\\", so the new fee may have in fact been a licence fee rather than court fees. Historian K G Allars notes that Hunter thought that the charges made by Dore for the issuing of writs and licences were excessive. Whatever the situation, Hunter wanted those fees to go to an orphan asylum in the colony. Hunter instead had to provide rations to those undertaking the care of orphans.Economic Growth of Australia 1788‚Äì1821 by Noel Bede Nairn, 1969 Melbourne University Press Next, Hunter did not wish writs to be issued against convicts. In those days, debtors who did not pay their debts could be imprisoned until their debt was paid. A convict who was imprisoned was therefore unable to perform work duties for the colony. Allars states that Hunter did not agree with the practice because it showed that Dore sided with 'petty traders' in the colony who were causing convicts to incur debts when convicts were not supposed to be able to hold property because of their status. This was in contrast to Collins and Richard Atkins who favoured farmers and settlers by providing time for debts to paid.Kercher Compounding this, Dore decided to issue the writs in his own name rather in the name of the court. When Dore was questioned about the legality of this procedure by the magistrate members of the court, Dore stormed off and refused to answer any questions. Dore was also to fall out over the trial of Isaac Nichols where Nichols was convicted on hearsay evidence, although as has been pointed out, Dore was only one member of five member bench who had decided on Nichols' fate. One of those unhappy with Nichols' conviction was navigator Matthew Flinders. Dore also presided over a committee which inquired into a suspected Irish conspiracy. Unfortunately, there appeared to be little evidence for a conspiracy, let alone an attempt at insurrection. Nevertheless, Dore ordered severe punishments for those thought to have planned an insurrection. Dore died on 13 December 1800 leaving insufficient estate to pay his creditors. References Sources *K.

It is the easternmost lake in the Tyres√•n Lake System. The lake empties to the west through G√∂mmarb√§cken (\\"G√∂mmaren Rill\\") and to the east through Fullersta√•n (\\"Fullersta Stream\\"), which is further downstream guided in culverts under the commercial centre of Huddinge (Huddinge Centrum) before flowing south-east to empty into Lake Treh√∂rningen. Motorboats are not allowed on the lake. Its clear water makes it popular for various open-air activities such as angling and bathing in summer, and skating in winters as it is one of the first lakes in Huddinge to freeze. Bathing from cliffs surrounding the lake is popular, but a sand beach is also available. A local fishing society (L√•ngsj√∂n-G√∂mmarens Fiskev√•rdsf√∂rening) is managing lake conservation and supply the general public with fishing permits.Huddinge sj√∂ar (site)  History  Notwithstanding the lake's name, documented from the 18th century and most likely hinting at the hidden away location, settlements have been present near the lake since the Stone Age.Stockholm County Museum The property of V√•rby G√•rd, a nearby homestead, used to reach the lake in the 18th century, but the central building burnt down in 1975 and none of its gardens, brewing, bakery, smithy, or poultry houses are left.Stockholmsk√§llan  Catchment area  The lake is located in a forest forming part of the G√∂mmaren Nature Reserve created in 1995 and as such is considered as important for recreation and nature conservation, a popular destination both for lovers of open-air life and for schools.  Environmental influence  The water of the lake is very clear and virtually colourless, which reflects the nutrient-poor flat rock pine forest of the surrounding area. Most of nutrient contribution to the lake comes from settlements south of the lake, also responsible for about 80 per cent of the phosphorus input. A hydrogeological examination in 1985 showed the surrounding soil is poorly fit to take up increased levels of waste water. Acidification has been neutralized by liming which has produced excellent pH- levels.  Flora and fauna  Cliffs and roots by Lake G√∂mmaren. The swampy forest surrounding the lake attracts many visitors. Many species of aquatic plants are present in the lake: reed, common club-rush, water horsetail, narrow leaf cattail, white beak-sedge, gypsywort, bulbous rush, white waterlily, broad-leaved pondweed, alternate water-milfoil, and intermediate bladderwort. Along the shores are grey willow, goat willow, aspen, black alder, bog-myrtle, tall bog-sedge, common sedge, bottle sedge, slender sedge, cranberry, and round-leaved sundew. Fish species native to the lake include northern pike, perch, roach, and, to some degree, rudd. There are many introduced species such as rainbow trout, North American brook trout, trout, and the hybrid species splake making the lake well-attended by anglers during both summers and winters. Crayfish plague eliminated the population of noble crayfish in 1987, but some 1.200 signal crayfishes were introduced in the early 1990s. Common birds are mallard and common gull, but other species such as common goldeneye, common tern, and a couple of black-throated diver are breeding by the lake and herons and ospreys are feeding in the area. Trees by the lake shores also attract long-tailed tit and lesser spotted woodpecker, and occasionally whooper swan, and great crested grebe are reported by the lake. Additionally, many species of dragonflies have been reported but no inventory of bats have been made.

Hogarth produced the painting directly after his return from France, where he had been arrested as a spy while sketching in Calais. The scene depicts a side of beef being transported from the harbour to an English tavern in the port, while a group of undernourished, ragged French soldiers and a fat friar look on hungrily. Hogarth painted himself in the left corner with a \\"soldier's hand upon my shoulder.\\"J. B. Nichols, 1833 p.63-p.64 \\"I meant to display to my own countryman the striking difference of food, priests, soldiers, &c.; of two nations\\" ... \\"The melancholy and miserable Highlander, browzing on his scanty fare, consisting of a bit of bread and an onion, is intended for one of the many that fled this country after the rebellion in 1745.\\" Background In July 1748, Hogarth took a trip to Paris, taking advantage of the armistice which preceded the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in October that year. He travelled with some artist friends, including Thomas Hudson, Joseph and Alexander Van Aken, Francis Hayman, and Henry Cheere. George Vertue reports that the group split up on the return journey, with Hogarth and Hayman making their way to Calais to catch the boat to England and the others continuing their tour to Flanders and the Netherlands. While waiting in Calais, Hogarth decided to sketch the gate of the port and drawbridge which were still adorned with the English arms (Calais having been an English enclave until 1558 and still retaining many English architectural features). His sketching of the fortifications aroused suspicion, and he was arrested and taken before the governor. Most accounts relate that Hogarth showed his other sketches to his captors; it becoming clear that he was merely an artist, he was discharged into the parole of his landlord to await the changing of the wind and the boat to England. Horace Walpole elaborates the account, reporting that Hogarth was forced to demonstrate his abilities by producing sketches and caricatures as demanded by the French, \\"particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the Lion d'Argent, the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it.\\" At any rate, Hogarth was discharged and returned to England by the next boat. Painting According to Hogarth's autobiographical notes, he started on the painting as soon as he arrived home from Calais. The painting was completed in short order, followed by an engraving early the next year. The painting takes a viewpoint under an archway in the main outer wall of Calais. The scene within centres around a sirloin of beef destined for the English tavern, the Lion d'Argent, carried by a chef who stands out in his bright white apron and cap. The French soldiers, dressed in rags and forced to eat their watery soupe maigre, gather round licking their lips. Two soldiers in sabots can be seen carrying a cauldron of the grey unappetising soup. The Franciscan friar who greedily rubs his finger in the fat of the beef joint, is thought to be based on Hogarth's friend John Pine. In the foreground, a Highlander, an exile from the Jacobite rising of 1745, sits slumped against the wall, his strength sapped by the poor French fare ‚Äì a raw onion and a crust of bread. Hogarth is seen sketching to the left in the background, but the tip of the halberd and hand of the soldier who will arrest him are just appearing round the corner behind him. There are strong references to the celebration of Eucharist in the picture. Through the gates, under the sign of a dove (that of an inn) a Roman Catholic mass is being celebrated. In the foreground, but still aligned with those in the background under the cross of the gate, the principal characters worship the beef. The man carrying it bows under the weight appearing to offer it up to the friar on partially bended knee. Above the scene in front of the gate, the dove of peace is replaced by a carrion bird, the crow. In the foreground fishwives superstitiously worship the face of a ray, and the Jacobite also clasps his hand together in prayer. Hogarth's antipathy to the French had been apparent in his art since Noon in his Four Times of the Day series, painted in 1736. The March to Finchley, which he painted in 1749/50, provides a companion theme to The Gate of Calais: it depicts a fictional gathering of robust English guardsman who are to march north to defend London against the invasion of Bonnie Prince Charlie's Jacobites in 1745. Further anti-French sentiment is apparent in his two Invasion engravings, published in 1756, and in Beer Street, where Rev. James Townley's accompanying verses stress the superiority of the English. The Gate of Calais secondary title, O, the Roast Beef of Old England, is a reference to the popular patriotic ballad 'The Roast Beef of Old England' from Henry Fielding's The Grub-Street Opera (1731), which told of how the food \\"ennobled our brains and enriched our blood\\" and laughed at \\"all- vapouring France\\"\\". The painting was bought by the 1st Earl of Charlemont sometime after the 1761 Society of Artists' Exhibition at which it was displayed, by which time England had been at war with France again for 5 years. Ian Pears believes that by showing The Gates of Calais at the exhibition (one of only three comic histories that he displayed), Hogarth was challenging the patriotic spirit of the British by asking them to pay as much for a work by an Englishman as they would for a work by a continental painter. The painting was acquired by the 1st Duke of Westminster at an auction at Christie's in 1891; he donated it to the National Gallery in 1895, and it was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1951. Print The engraving of the print. The hand on Hogarth's shoulder can now be clearly seen, as can the Scotsman and his fare The print, produced from an engraving that was completed in part by Charles Mosley, was published on 6 March 1749. Entitled \\"O The Roast Beef of Old England\\", it was priced at 5 shillings and advertised as: The main difference between the painting and the engraving is the crow on top of the gate, which is absent in the engraving. The crow was a late addition to the painting to disguise an accidental tear, apparently caused by the canvas falling on a nail shortly after it was completed, although no evidence of damage was found when the painting was restored in 1966.

The river is under tidal influence for the last of its length. Although generally shallow the Deep River has depths of up to in places. The Deep River is one of the few perennial rivers in Western Australia although 80% of its discharge occurs in winter and spring. The rivers water quality is very good, fresh and low in nutrients. The majority of the catchment of the Deep River is not cleared. The silt and clay content can be high during the winter period. The Deep River begins just west of Lake Muir about 50 km from the coast on the edge of the Yilgarn Plateau. Lake Muir may, in flood, overflow into the Deep River catchment. It flows through a valley between granite hills then wanders across the coastal plain finally entering the Nornalup Inlet on the western side. The two tributaries of the Deep River are the Weld River and Croea Brook. Some features of the river include wide unobstructed pools interspersed with rapids such as Rowell's Pool and two waterfalls, Fernhook Falls and Gladstone Falls. The Deep River flows through forested areas of National Park including the Walpole-Nornalup National Park before discharging into the Nornalup Inlet. The first recorded name of the river was given in 1841 by the Colonial Secretary, Peter Broun. It had been known as the Frankland River by sealers that operated in the area. The explorer William Nairne Clark named it the West River on his charts but Broun later decided on the current name.

Born in Bristol, Tennessee, Reynolds received his high school education at Lawrenceville School, where he captained the prep school's football team. He went on to graduate from Princeton University and would join the family business where he worked for more than fifty years. He followed his brother Richard S.

In 1986, at age seventy, he stepped down as president but remained chairman of the board of directors. In 1963, David Reynolds launched the Reynolds Company's production of the country's first all-aluminum beer cans. Because of the light-weight material, compared to the previous steel cans, this innovation became a great success for the company and has dominated the market ever since. Thoroughbred horse racing Reynolds became interested in Thoroughbred horse racing and notably owned and bred sprint horse Lord Carson, a multiple stakes race winner who equaled the track record for 6 furlongs at both Churchill Downs and Turfway Park.

For a discussion of the differences between the two see the notes on Sesotho orthography. *Hovering the mouse cursor over most Sesotho text should reveal an IPA pronunciation key (excluding tones). |} The Sesotho language has traditional names for the months of the familiar Gregorian calendar. The names reflect a deep connection that the Basotho people traditionally have with the natural world and the importance of agriculture. Although the month names are often not used by the general public (being considered part of \\"deep Sesotho\\"), they are regularly used in news broadcasts and other media and are more common than English imports. Additionally, the names of the seasons and the days of the week are regularly used by all speakers. Months The names of the months () indicate special natural and agricultural events which traditionally happened during the period. Being cattle breeders who lived in the semi-arid regions of southern Africa, a deep understanding of agriculture and the natural world was essential for the survival of the Basotho people. The year begins roughly in the month of August, when the seeds are planted in anticipation of the next month's explosion of life.Many of the explanations of the names that follow are probably very good examples of folk etymology, and may not necessarily be entirely accurate. # (August) ‚Äì from the verb (dig) as the barren fields are ploughed and prepared in anticipation of the next months explosion of life. # (September) ‚Äì the grass grows and the cows grow fat on it. They produce so much milk that the expression (the milk has spilled over) is used. # (October) ‚Äì this is a shortening of the compound noun meaning \\"The flower shoots of the boophone disticha plant\\", and it said that this is the time when the flower starts producing shoots. # (November) ‚Äì many wildebeest deliver their young in this month, and the name is a diminutive of (wildebeest). # (December) ‚Äì large numbers of a species of small grasshopper () are found at this time. Since cattle start producing less milk in this period, it is said that the cows are being milked by the grasshoppers. # (January) ‚Äì the crops begin to grow large and bird-scarers set up camp in their fields. They erect small structures and (set up the rafters using old pieces of dried wood) # (February) ‚Äì the sorghum plants release a white substance () signaling the emergence of the ears of corn. As the ears of corn emerge, it is said that the are being wiped off, and this name is a shortening of (\\"Wipe the off). # (March) ‚Äì the sorghum grains are visible and birds start eating them. The name is a compound noun from (grains of sorghum) # (April) ‚Äì there are large numbers of a certain species of grasshopper known as . Herd boys make fires at night and eat roasted maize with . This gave rise to the proverb (one needs to be diligent when doing a job, lit. the roaster does not blink); the name comes from the first word in this proverb (the roaster). # (May) ‚Äì the sorghum grains have become hard ‚Äì too hard for the birds to eat them. It is said that the plants are laughing at the birds, and the name is a contraction of (the one who laughs at the birds). # (June) ‚Äì this is the beginning of Winter, and all plants seem to die and many wild animals leave on migrations. It is said that Nature is holding back on life. The name means \\"a small holding back\\" and is a diminutive of the name of the following month. # (July) ‚Äì everything seems completely dead and lifeless. Nature is holding back completely. Seasons Like many other sub-Saharan African societies who historically lived in tropical regions, Sesotho-speaking people generally recognise only two seasons (). However, names do exist for all four of the traditional western European seasons. The year begins in approximately August or September, when the crops are planted. # (spring) ‚Äì from the verb (plant) as the crops are planted at the beginning of this period. This is also the most common name for \\"year.\\" # (summer) ‚Äì more often than not this name is used for both the spring and the summer. # (autumn) ‚Äì from the ancient Proto- Bantu root *-ginja (\\"hot season\\"). This noun is often used without the class prefix (that is, as ). # (winter) ‚Äì from the ancient and widespread Proto- Bantu root *-t√Æka (\\"cold weather; cold season; night\\"). More often than not this name is used to denote both autumn and winter. Weekdays The concept of dividing the month into four seven-day weeks (, from Afrikaans \\"week\\") is a recent European innovation. The week begins on Monday. # [m…ënÃ©t º…ëh…ë]|Mantaha|dotted=no}} (Monday) # (Tuesday) ‚Äì Contraction of \\"\\" (\\"the second day\\"). # (Wednesday) ‚Äì \\"the third one.\\" # (Thursday) ‚Äì \\"the fourth one.\\" # (Friday) ‚Äì \\"the fifth one.\\" # (Saturday) ‚Äì from isiXhosa \\"uMgqibelo\\" (\\"Saturday, the ending\\") from the verb \\"ukugqiba\\" (\\"to finish\\"). # [sonÃ©t º…ëh…ë]|Sontaha|dotted=no}}(Sunday) ‚Äì Meaning \\"the day of the Lord\\".

Former Hopkins President Steven Muller and former NJU President Kuang Yaming worked together to create the Center, recognizing the importance of improved understanding and relations between their respective countries. Muller believed China to be \\"the country of the future.\\" Rienzi, Greg. \\"An Unlikely Success Story in China\\", Johns Hopkins Gazette, June 11, 2007. Vol 36, No. 37. History In 1984, Steven Muller, then the president of The Johns Hopkins University, conceived of the Center as a legacy of his presidency, and as an opportunity for JHU to be the first American university to establish a formal presence in China. Nanjing University was chosen as a partner because of its prestige, as one of the best universities in China, because of its location, and because of its willingness to devote resources to the Center. The Center opened in 1986, and has operated continuously since, even during tumultuous periods like the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests and the 2003 SARS crisis. In the latter case, the program was shifted to a temporary location in Hawaii for the duration of the outbreak. Today, the Center is known in the United States as a preeminent institution for the training of Americans with China-focused careers.  Mission  The mission of the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center is \\"to develop and train professionals to provide leadership in managing successful bilateral and multilateral relationships involving China and the West in an increasingly complex international environment.\\"Hopkins Hopkins Nanjing Center The Center and China  Academics  The west gate of the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, facing Shanghai Road in Nanjing. The Center is unique in that it is the only joint program of its kind in China. The Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center offers an opportunity for students to appreciate how Western and Chinese societies view themselves and how they interact with other cultures. Students benefit from modern facilities, such as the only uncensored, open-stacks library in China, offering both English and Chinese collections. The Center's international students take most of their courses in Chinese taught by Chinese faculty, while Chinese students are taught by American or international faculty, with classes primarily in English. Students may also take some courses taught in their native language, so most classes have a mix of Chinese and international students. The academic program has evolved over time. The Center originally provided English language courses for Chinese students and Chinese language courses for international students. The English language courses were suspended during the 1997-1998 school year, as the Chinese administrators of the Center concluded that the language skills of entering Chinese students were already sufficient for the program. This decision was opposed by the American faculty. The Chinese language courses were suspended several years later. These changes reflected a controversy over whether the Center represented a substantive graduate program or a language school; for many years, Johns Hopkins SAIS only awarded half-credit for participation in the program on these grounds.  Students  The student body at the center is composed of approximately 50% Chinese citizens and 50% international students. The international population is made up largely of Americans but includes individuals from countries such as France, Russia, South Korea, Canada, and the UK. Many students hold undergraduate degrees in Chinese or East Asian Studies. Some also hold advanced degrees prior to attending the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center. During the 2009-2010 school year, there were 40 international Certificate students, 11 Second-Year MA students, and 19 First- Year MA students, reflecting the Center's intent to expand the Masters program. The Chinese student body has a higher ratio of Certificate students, but an overall relatively equal number of students.  Programs of study  The Sam Pollard building houses the center's library and academic classrooms. The Center offers two distinct academic programs: a two-year Master of Arts in International Studies and a one-year graduate Certificate program. Certificate program The Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center offers a graduate Certificate in Chinese and American Studies. Certificate students spend one year at the Center and have great flexibility in the courses they choose to take during that year. The Center‚Äôs international (American and all other non- Chinese) students learn about China from a Chinese perspective. These students focus on how the Chinese interpret China-United States relations, how they view their changing economic and political systems, and how they analyze their own political, social, and intellectual history. Master of Arts in international studies The Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center Master of Arts in International Studies is a two-year graduate degree jointly offered by The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and Nanjing University. Students will benefit from the resources offered by both institutions and are considered alumni of both schools. The M.A. allows students to select from one of four concentrations: Chinese Studies, International Politics, International Economics, and Comparative and International Law. The M.A. degree will bring Chinese and international students together in the same classrooms ‚Äî a feature of the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center not found in other programs offered in China. The first student graduated from the MA program in January 2008. SAIS Five-Semester Option Students who have been admitted to the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C. as well as the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center are eligible to participate in a five-semester option which would ultimately award them both a Certificate in Chinese and American Studies from the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center and a Master of Arts degree from SAIS. After the successful completion of two semesters in Nanjing and three additional semesters at SAIS in Washington, they will receive both credentials. The order of the coursework is flexible, but the year at the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center must be completed during any contiguous academic year. For instance, a student may: * Attend the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center before or while applying to SAIS, where they will spend three additional semesters * Spend a year at the Center after completing two semesters in SAIS, then return to SAIS for one semester * Begin the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center certificate program in the fall after completing three semesters at SAIS in Washington Students pursuing this option are required to meet the admissions requirements of both the HNC Certificate program and the SAIS M.A. degree. Separate applications are required for each program. Acceptance to either the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center or to SAIS does not constitute acceptance to the other institution. HNC Five-Semester Option Alumni who have already completed the one year certificate program are eligible to return to the Center and graduate with a Master of Arts from both Johns Hopkins and Nanjing University in three additional semesters. Admission to the class is not guaranteed and alumni applicants will follow the same procedures as first time applicants. See also *Paul H.

It has also been claimed that she was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.November 23, 1973) was an American operatic mezzo-soprano, known for her work in both opera and recital performances. Jennie Tourel Early years Tourel was born in Vitebsk in the Russian Empire (now in Belarus), with the surname Davidovich. As a young girl she played the flute, then studied piano. After the Russian Revolution, her Jewish family left Russia and settled temporarily near Danzig. They later moved to Paris, where she continued to study piano and contemplated a concert career. She then began to take voice lessons with Reynaldo Hahn and Anna El-Tour, and decided to devote herself to professional singing. She was said to have changed her last name to Tourel by transposing the syllables of El-Tour's name, but she denied this.Laura Williams Macy, The Grove Book of Opera Singers Singing career Jennie Tourel made her European operatic debut at the Op√©ra Russe in Paris in 1931, and subsequently sang at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris as Carmen, (April 9, 1933) also singing Mignon, Jacqueline (Le m√©decin malgr√© lui), Djamileh in 1938, Charlotte (Werther) and Marcellina (The Marriage of Figaro) in 1940. She created three roles at the Salle Favart: Labryssa in Tout Ank Amon (May 5, 1934), Missouf in Zadig (June 24, 1938) and Zouz in La nuit embaum√©e (March 25, 1939).Wolff S. Un demi-si√®cle d'Op√©ra-Comique (1900-1950). Andr√© Bonne, Paris, 1953. She made her American d√©but at the Chicago Civic Opera in Ernest Moret's Lorenzaccio in 1930. Her career at the Metropolitan Opera was brief: she made her d√©but in May 1937, as Mignon, and appeared for a few seasons in the 1940s as Rosina, Adalgisa and Carmen. In 1940, just before the occupation of Paris by Nazi troops, she went to Lisbon, and eventually emigrated to the United States. She became a naturalized American citizen in 1946. In 1951 she created the role of Baba the Turk in Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress. She gave the first performances of songs by Leonard Bernstein (including the song cycles I Hate Music, 1943, and La Bonne Cuisine, 1949), Francis Poulenc and Paul Hindemith (notably the revised Marienleben cycle, 1949). Teaching and later years In later years, Jennie Tourel devoted herself to recitals and orchestra engagements, excelling particularly in French repertoire. Her last opera performance was as Do√±a Marta in the world premiere of Thomas Pasatieri's Black Widow at the Seattle Opera in 1972. She also taught at the Juilliard School of Music in New York, at the Aspen School of Music in Colorado, and at the American Institute of Musical Studies in Graz, Austria. One of her most famous students was the soprano Barbara Hendricks, who first met Tourel in Colorado and later worked with her at Juilliard. In 1998, Hendricks paid tribute to her teacher with a recording of art songs titled: R√©cital \\"Hommage √† Jennie Tourel\\"Subtitled \\"Songs Jennie taught me, works by Rossini, Liszt, Debussy, Dvo≈ô√°k, and Rachmaninov, with pianist Staffan Scheja, EMI Classics, 1998.

It was erected by the Almoravid dynasty in the early 12th century. It is notable for its extraordinary decoration and for being one of the only remnants of Almoravid architecture in Marrakech.  History  leftThe Almoravid Qubba is situated next to the Marrakech Museum and around 40 meters south of the Mosque of Ben Youssef. It is the only surviving example of Almoravid architecture in Marrakesh. It was built in either 1117 or, more likely, in 1125, by the Almoravid amir Ali ibn Yusuf. Most scholars today believe that it belonged to the nearby Ben Youssef Mosque, the main mosque of the city at the time, and that it was a pavilion used for ritual ablutions before prayer. The mosque itself, also originally built by Ali ibn Yusuf, has since been completely rebuilt in more recent centuries. This type of structure for providing water near a mosque was also known as a mida'a (; \\"ablutions facility\\") and is found in later mosques in Marrakech. The domed structure also had a system of toilets, showers, and faucets for drinking water. It was rediscovered in 1948 and excavated in 1952, after having been buried beneath one of the outbuildings of the Ben Youssef Mosque.  Description   The domed pavilion  The dome (qubba) tops a rectangular building, measuring 7.35 by 5.45 meters, sheltering a water basin. Materials used include stone, brick, and cedar wood. The interior is richly decorated with carved floral and vegetal patterns (pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves), palmette/seashell shapes, and calligraphy. Its cupola has been compared to the domes of the Great Mosque of Cordoba and the Bab al-Mardum Mosque in Toledo (both older buildings from Spanish Ummayyad architecture). In the corners, between the wings of the cupola and the rectangular outer walls, are four miniature cupolas carved with some of the earliest muqarnas decoration in Morocco. Since muqarnas decoration would have originated in Abbasid architecture in the Middle East, at least one scholar has suggested that this combination of Cordoban Ummayyad and Abbasid motifs was a deliberate stylistic choice by the Almoravid ruler to invoke a shared legacy and heritage with these caliphates. Around the interior of the pavilion is an Arabic inscription, now badly damaged, which details the foundation of the structure and cites the name of Ali ibn Yusuf and the date of construction, although the year of the date is unfortunately unreadable (leading to scholarly debate about the exact date).

The main basin is surrounded by a thin trench where spilled water could be drained.  Other structures around the pavilion  A series of private latrines, possibly built at a later period, have also been excavated all around the domed building. Next to the domed building was also a monumental fountain or water source in another rectangular structure measuring around 14.5 by 4.5 meters. The structure was open to the street via three arched openings, with each bay occupied by a water basin and a water trough along its back wall. This fountain structure is reminiscent, in its basic form, of later wall fountains of Marrakech like those of the Mouassine Mosque or of the Shrob ou Shouf Fountain. The water for this fountain and the ablutions kiosk was drawn via bronze pipes from a nearby cistern covered by a barrel vault, which can be found today behind these structures. The supply of water to this cistern probably relied in turn on the revolutionary hydraulics of khettaras, a drainage system characteristic of historic Morocco.

Johannes Ringk, or Ringck (26 June 1717 ‚Äì 24 August 1778), was a German composer and organist. He was born in Frankenhain, in present-day Thuringia, and studied organ with Johann Peter Kellner in Gr√§fenroda and Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel in Gotha. From 1740 he was a music teacher in Berlin, and in 1754 he was appointed organist of the Marienkirche, where he remained until his death. Contemporaries held a high opinion of his organ playing and ability at fugal extemporisation. He composed organ works, concertos and possibly an opera, but is most remembered today for the numerous copies he made, often the only ones now remaining, of works by more notable composers. Amongst these copies in his hand are Johann Sebastian Bach's cantata Weichet nur, betr√ºbte Schatten, BWV 202 and the oldest copy of the famous Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565. It is possible that the copies were made from versions in Kellner's collection, who was a pupil of Bach. The copies in Kellner's collection, which were made about 1725, are today one of the most important sources of Bach's work.

History and alumni The teaching of Chemistry at Edinburgh began in 1713 when James Crawford was appointed to the 'Chair of Physik and Chymistry' (where 'physik' = natural science/art of medicine). The department has occupied many sites in its history, from a house at the top of Robertson's Close in the city centre, to purpose-built facilities in the central campus at Old College through to its current location at King's Buildings. Each move has brought with it expansions in size and status until the department occupied the position it does now, as one of the world's leading Chemistry teaching and research establishments. The department also hosts the oldest student-run Chemistry society in the world which was created in 1785 and is still active today. Today the department carries on the traditions of Chemistry at Edinburgh both in teaching and research. The collaborative research School formed with St Andrews University Chemistry department to form EaStCHEM has strengthened research in Scotland in the chemical sciences. Alumni and former staff include: James Dewar Lesley Yellowlees CBE, first female president of the Royal Society of Chemistry * Thomas Anderson, discoverer of pyridine * Joseph Black, discoverer of carbon dioxide, latent heat and specific heat * Perdita Barran, Professor in the School of Chemistry, University of Manchester * Neil Campbell, chemist and amateur athlete * Archibald Scott Couper, proposed an early theory of chemical structure and bonding * John Davy, discoverer of phosgene * James Dewar, inventor of the Dewar flask * Narayan Hosmane, cancer researcher, BNCT * David Leigh, Forbes Chair of Organic Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh from 2001 to 2012, Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology winner in 2007 * Christina Miller, synthesized phosphorus trioxide * Dai Rees, CEO of the Medical Research Council from 1987 to 1996 * Prafulla Chandra Roy, distinguished chemist and founder of Bengal Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals * Daniel Rutherford, discovered nitrogen while he was studying at the University of Edinburgh in 1772 * James Fraser Stoddart, supramolecular chemist * Lesley Yellowlees CBE, first female president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Vice-President of the University of Edinburgh Organisation The school has a research staff of approximately 120 individuals, and an academic staff of over 40. Current annual enrollment includes around 200 research students, and 450 taught postgraduate and undergraduate students. EaStCHEM is the joint research school in chemistry between the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews. It has eight research groupings: Chemical Biology; Synthesis; Materials; Structural Chemistry; Chemical Physics; Biophysical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; and Catalysis. In the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2008, the most in-depth analysis of research outputs for seven years, EaStCHEM, submitted 73% of all world leading outputs (4*) in Scotland and 12% of world leading outputs in all of the UK. From 31 submissions EastChem was the largest in UK Chemistry. EaStCHEM comes joint 4th in the Grade Point Average (GPA) metric, and first when staff numbers are factored in (the power ranking).  Research Themes  The School has four major research themes as part of EaStCHEM: The Chemistry/Biology Interface area is broad, with particular strengths in the areas of protein structure and function, mechanistic enzymology, proteomics, biologically targeted synthesis, the application of high throughput and combinatorial approaches and biophysical chemistry, which focuses on the development and application of physicochemical techniques to biological systems. Chemical Physics/Physical Chemistry is the fundamental study of molecular properties and processes. Areas of expertise include probing molecular structure in the gas phase, clusters and nanoparticles, the development and application of physicochemical techniques such as mass spectrometry to molecular systems and the EaStCHEM surface science group, who study complex molecules on surfaces, probing the structure property-relationships employed in heterogeneous catalysis. A major feature is In Silico Scotland, a world class research computing facility. Molecular Synthesis encompasses the synthesis and characterisation at ambient and extreme conditions of organic and inorganic compounds, including those with application in homogeneous catalysis, nanotechnology, supramolecular chemistry, drug discovery and ligand design. The development of innovative synthetic and characterisation methodologies (particularly in structural chemistry) is a key feature. The Materials Chemistry group is one of the largest materials chemistry groups in the UK. Areas of strength include the design, synthesis and characterisation of strongly correlated electronic materials, battery and fuel cell materials and devices, porous solids, materials at extreme pressures and temperatures, polymer microarray technologies and technique development for materials and nanomaterials analysis.

The site, near the village of Acme in Westmoreland County, is surrounded by private forest in the Allegheny Mountains and features four architectural landmarks: Frank Lloyd Wright's (1867‚Äì1959) Donald C. Duncan House and R. W. Lindholm Residence, and two others by Peter Berndtson (1909‚Äì1972), who was one of the original Wright apprentices. The park is near Wright's Fallingwater (23 miles) and Kentuck Knob (29 miles). Duncan House and Lindholm House are the only Wright houses in the area that accommodate overnight visitors. Berndtson's 1962 master plan for Polymath Park allowed for 24 dwellings, each sited in a circular clearing in the forest. Only two houses, however, were actually built: the Balter House in 1964 and the 1965 Blum House. Duncan House was added to the park in June 2007. Built in 1957 in Lisle, Illinois, for Donald and Elizabeth Duncan, Wright's prefab Usonian was deconstructed in suburban Chicago in 2004 and reassembled in Pennsylvania. Lindholm House, named M√§ntyl√§, was built in 1952 for R. W. Lindholm at Cloquet, Minnesota, and was dismantled in 2016 and rebuilt at Polymath Park in 2018. It opened in April 2019. Polymath Park is run by the nonprofit Usonian Preservation Corporation. Proceeds from rentals go toward maintenance of the houses and to architectural education programs.

Kirkham began her stage career at the age of nine in Menominee. She was the leading lady, playwright, producer, and manager. When her family moved to Los Angeles she acted in plays in Burbank, California. At the time it was a center of theatrical life. She was featured in productions such as The Virginian and The Squaw Man, with actor Dustin Farnum.Began Her Stage Career At Nine, Los Angeles Times, August 2, 1925, Page D18.

In August 1925 Kirkham was in a production of Redemption at the Potboiler Art Theater in Los Angeles. Kirkham was blonde and considered one of the best-dressed actresses. In most of her films she appears in fifteen to eighteen changes of clothing. Kirkham became widely known after the release of The Eyes of the World (1915).Kathleen Kirkham Returns To Screen, Los Angeles Times, July 26, 1925, Page 29.

Legal action In 1924 Kirkham sued the William Fox vaudeville company for failure to pay $750 it owed her as an employee. Another $350 was requested for a motion picture wardrobe which she had purchased. Fox countered Kirkham's action by asserting that the actress had asked for, and was granted, rescission from her contract, before performing the services specified by it. Kirkham was granted a full judgment against Fox, but the company asked for a rehearing in September 1924.Motion For New Film Case Trial Is Heard, Los Angeles Times, September 30, 1924, Page A9.

It provides products throughout Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky. The company is owned by and operates as a subsidiary of Dean Foods and their products includes milk, cultures, and ice cream, orange juice, lemonade, tea and water, and it is one of the last distributors of the Nutty Buddy ice cream cone. They also once had a partnership deal for home delivery through Plumgood Foods, a now defunct grocery delivery company. History In 1926, Dr. C.N. Cowden sold his dairy farm to Miles Ezell after he had rented it for a year, and it was named Ezell's Dairy. By the 1940s, many local dairies had closed due to the requirement of pasteurization, and Ezell's Dairy was one of the few that remained. In 1945, the farm was shut down, but Ezell obtained a small business loan, bought the Green Vale milk plant on Murfreesboro Road, and merged with Rosebank Dairies. In 1946, the company was formally incorporated as Purity Dairies. Albert Gasser joined the company as President and helped Purity become the dominant milk producer in middle Tennessee. Purity at one time promoted itself as a provider of \\"Golden Gernsey\\" milk. Later, it stressed its \\"GoldenFlake\\" buttermilk and won national awards with the product. Purity was one of the first to use HEPA filtration in its cottage cheese production area and this helped to dramatically improve the shelf life of the product. It was the first to use wax-free paper packaging and opaque gallon containers for milk. Purity was also known for creative advertising and used Jim Varney in a series of ads that helped to expand its market penetration, with his character of Ernest P. Worrell becoming an icon in the advertising world. A sales force was established in the mid-1950s with one man, Tom Pugh, initially becoming the entire force. The force was later expanded to include several other sales professionals who were instrumental in expanding Purity's market share with area retailers. In the late 1980s in a collaboration with Blue Bell creameries, Purity expanded its line to include an ice cream that became the best seller in the area. In 1998, the company was purchased by Dean Foods. Members of the Ezell family, one of the founders, are still involved in the management of Purity Dairies.

It was founded in 1947 and is based in the United States. The organization is headquartered in Portland, Maine. Programs CIEE operates over 175 study abroad programs in over 40 countries and teaching programs in Chile, China, Spain, and Thailand. Summer seminars in 29 countries are available. As the largest sponsor of J-1 visa programs, CIEE organizes seasonal work experiences in the United States for approximately 45,000 university students each year through its Work & Travel USA program. It also organizes high school exchange programs for students in the United States as well as more than 30 countries around the world. CIEE also maintains a membership community, the CIEE Academic Consortium. Academic institutions join the consortium in order to affiliate with CIEE's mission, to support CIEE's advocacy efforts in Washington and other world capitals, and to have a policy voice in CIEE's educational programs and activities. As such, CIEE Members are part of a worldwide network of colleges and universities. Among others, CIEE established the Council Study Centre at Vietnam National University, which receives about 50 students from various countries learning Vietnamese language and other sciences, and Study Center in Khon Kaen, Thailand. History One of the major goals after World War II was to develop international understanding and establish trust between nations. The development of student and teacher travel was considered the most effective tool to achieve that goal. As Senator J. William Fulbright said, ‚ÄúEducational exchange can turn nations into people, contributing as no other form of communication can to the humanizing of international relations‚Äù (Fulbright, 1994). In the United States, a number of organizations and religious groups became immediately interested in re-establishing various types of educational exchange programs that had been suspended in 1939 at the beginning of the war. There was a strong political rationale for the U.S. government to support student travel abroad programs. Students were seen as ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù of their own country who would represent the best national interests of the American society abroad and promote international understanding. At the same time, development of student travel abroad for educational and cultural purposes preserved a strong academic interest resulting from broadening the horizons of the younger generation and educating them through exchanges for cross-cultural and international competence. In 1946, the international situation and the shortage of ships in trans-Atlantic service did not permit such travel, but in 1947 many organizations endeavored to send exchange students abroad to conferences, work camps, and study seminars. It was recognized that special provisions would need to be made for U.S. student groups going to Europe during the summer seasons and that only joint efforts could be undertaken in order to pursue this goal. Prior to May 1947, representatives of a number of educational agencies had been negotiating with the U.S. Department of State about the possibility of utilizing troop transports for the re-establishment of educational travel and exchange programs during the summer of 1947. In April 1947, at the request of the Department of State, the Maritime Commission agreed to assign two C-4 Troop ships to be used for sending U.S. students on exchange programs to Europe that summer. The United States Lines and the Moore-McCormick Line were asked to serve as general agents for these vessels (although at a later date the Moore- McCormick Line was dropped and the United States Lines took full responsibility for the operation of the vessels). The Department of State was given the responsibility for determining which organizations and which students would be permitted to travel abroad on these ships. On October 21, 1948, 45 U.S., Western European, and international organizations (including UNESCO, U.S. Office of Education, World Federation of Education Associations, U.S. National Student Association, National Student YMCA, and YMCA) met to discuss the Student Ship Project. A group of leaders from the organizations most directly concerned secured government action to set aside special student ships, and formed themselves into an Executive Committee which would allocate space and administer the shipboard orientation programs. That effort gave way to the future Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE), the leading and oldest U.S. non-governmental organization in the field of international education and student study abroad. In 1967, CIEE started the first academic exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was situated at Leningrad University. Graduates of the program include Michael McFaul, the United States Ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. In April 2016, CIEE and The University of Pennsylvania Graduate School for Education Center for Minority Serving Institutions announced a joint $100,000 scholarship and three-year partnership to increase study abroad opportunities for students of color.

It range includes much of northern and northeastern India, and extends through Southeast Asia to Vietnam. It appears to be entirely sedentary. Formerly also called spur-winged lapwing, this name is better reserved for one of the \\"spur-winged plovers\\" of old, Vanellus spinosus of Africa, whose scientific name it literally translates. The masked lapwing of Australasia was at one time also called \\"spur-winged plover\\", completing the name confusion - particularly as none of these is a plover in the strict sense. This species resembles the closely related spur-winged lapwing of Africa, and has sometimes been considered conspecific. The species name commemorates Alfred Duvaucel.  Description  Jayanti in Buxa Tiger Reserve in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal, India. The river lapwing is 29‚Äì32 cm long. It has a black crest, crown, face and central throat and grey-white neck sides and nape. It has a grey-brown breast band and white underparts with a black belly patch. The back is brown, the rump is white and the tail is black. This is a striking species in flight, with black primaries, white under wings and upper wing secondaries, and brown upper wing coverts. River lapwing found in Jayanti river bed, Buxa Tiger Reserve, West Bengal,India Adults of both sexes are similarly plumaged, but males are slightly larger than females. Young birds have the brown tips to the black head feathers, a sandier brown back, and pale fringes to the upperpart and wing covert feathers. The call of the river lapwing is a sharp tip-tip or did-did-did.  Behaviour  The breeding display, given on the ground, includes stooping, spinning, stretching and crest-raising. The river lapwing nests on shingle and sand banks from March to June. It lays two eggs on a ground scrape. It feeds on insects, worms, crustaceans and molluscs in nearby wet grassland and farmland. It is not gregarious.

He was removed from the position in October 1998, months before the outbreak of Kosovo War. Although very little was known about him during the 1990s, he is widely seen as the \\"mastermind and conductor of controlled chaos\\" during the large part of Yugoslav Wars. Despite being the closest person to the President of Serbia Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, with enormous impact on wartime events, he kept permanent contacts with all the factors involved in the conflict. Allegedly, he was removed in 1998 from the key intelligence position due to disagreements with Mirjana Markoviƒá and the Minister of Internal Affairs Vlajko Stojiljkoviƒá, as he opposed the excessive use of force in Kosovo. Stani≈°iƒá is together with Franko Simatoviƒá being prosecuted for war crimes in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period from 1991 to 1995, before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).

The retrial before the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT) has commenced on 13 June 2017. The base of Stani≈°iƒá and Simatoviƒá's operations was revealed to be in western Bosnia, where they commanded regional forces.https://balkaninsight.com/2018/07/10/red-berets- fighter-serbian-officials-ran-operation-in-bosnia-07-10-2018/ Early years and education Stani≈°iƒá was born on 30 July 1950 in the village of Ratkovo, Od≈æaci, SR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. His parents were of Montenegrin descent, from Bjelopavliƒái. They have lived after the World War I in Kosovo, and migrated to Baƒçka where Stani≈°iƒá was born following the World War II. He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences in 1974 and got employed in the State Security Administration (UDBA) in 1975. Professional career ;UDBA's agent (1975‚Äì1991) Since he got employed within the Yugoslav State Security Administration (UDBA) in 1975, Stani≈°iƒá made big steps in the hierarchy of the agency. During the Cold War, Yugoslav UDBA was as nasty as its Soviet KGB counterpart. Between the mid-1960s and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1990s, UDBA assassinated more than hundred Yugoslav political emigrants (i.e. Yugoslav dissidents) around the world, mostly in Western Europe and the United States. Many of these assassinations were performed by criminals who in exchange for leniency about other crimes, did the \\"dirty work\\" for the country. ;Head of the SDB (1991‚Äì1998) With the breakup of Yugoslavia, a new agency State Security Service (SDB) was formed in March 1991. He served as the deputy of head Zoran Janaƒákoviƒá within the newly established State Security Service (SDB) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia throughout 1991. Despite being a deputy, he was widely seen as de facto head of the agency. On 1 January 1992, he was appointed as the Head of the agency while the Minister of Internal Affairs was Zoran Sokoloviƒá. He stayed on that position until 26 October 1998. During that time, he also served as Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia. In the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars, State Security Service under Stani≈°iƒá established linked paramilitary units, including the Serb Volunteer Guard (Arkan's Tigers), Special Operations Unit (Red Berets) and Scorpions. Allegedly, they were established for the purpose of undertaking special military actions in Croatia (Serb-controlled Republic of Serbian Krajina) and Bosnia and Herzegovina, intended to forcibly remove non-Serbs from those areas. It was later made public in 2018 that western Bosnia was in fact the main focus of Stani≈°iƒá's military operations and that he and Franko Simatoviƒá commanded regional forces during the ‚ÄòPauk‚Äô (‚ÄòSpider‚Äô) operation in Cazinska Krajina, Bosnia between 1994 and 1995. A map showing 30 command posts which Stanisic had set up in western Bosnia had been secretly intercepted from his command office in the village of Magarcevacas, Croatia as well. These secret paramilitary units were trained in various training centers and were then deployed to locations in Croatia and Bosnia where they were subordinated to other \\"Serb Forces\\", in particular the local Serb Territorial Defence. Many of the recruits were veteran criminals, including Arkan, who was UDBA's assassin responsible for many hits across Western Europe in the 1970s and 1980s. ;Going into the shadow (1998‚Äì2000) After he was removed from the position in October 1998 due to disagreements with Mirjana Markoviƒá and Minister of Internal Affairs Vlajko Stojiljkoviƒá, he was appointed as the National Security Advisor of Serbia. In October 1998, Radomir Markoviƒá became the new head of the agency. In 1999, the Kosovo War was intensified and the United States launched and led the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which lasted for 78 days and thus ended the war. Since then, Kosovo was not longer under control from FR Yugoslavia (Serbia) and was administrated under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. From 1998 to 2000, in a series of mafia wars in the last years of Milo≈°eviƒá‚Äôs rule, most of Serbian mobsters (who were part of these special units) and security officers were murdered under mysterious circumstances. The regime was ensuring that prominent officials do not stay alive to eventually testify against Milo≈°eviƒá and his cooperates in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY, The Hague). However, Stani≈°iƒá and his close associate Franko Simatoviƒá avoided a similar fate. Finally, Milo≈°eviƒá was overthrown on 5 October 2000, after 14 years in power. ICTY Trial ;Indictment and trial (2003‚Äì2013) After the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá, Stani≈°iƒá was arrested on 13 March 2003 during the Operation Sabre by the Serbian Police and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 11 June 2003. The original indictment against Stani≈°iƒá and Franko Simatoviƒá was created in May 2003, and was later amended several times. He pleaded not guilty to all charges in his first appearance before Court on 13 June 2003. His case was processed together with that of Franko Simatoviƒá. He has been charged with persecution, murder, deportation and inhumane acts. According to the prosecution, Stani≈°iƒá as key intelligence officer oversaw the Serbian special paramilitary units, including the Serb Volunteer Guard (Arkan's Tigers), Special Operations Unit (Red Berets) and Scorpions, which were secretly established by or with the assistance of the State Security Service (SDB) from no later than April 1991 and continued until 1995. These secret units composed of commandos and criminals who plundered their way across Croatia and Bosnia, committing many war crimes. The prosecution claims that Stani≈°iƒá, in his capacity as a key intelligence officer, oversaw these secret units composed of commandos and criminals who plundered their way across Croatia and Bosnia at FR Yugoslavia's behest. He and Simatoviƒá are being judged for the command responsibility in the following events: Baƒáin massacre, massacres in Lipovaƒça, Vukoviƒái and Saborsko, ≈†kabrnja massacre, Bru≈°ka massacre, Dalj massacre and Erdut massacre (in Croatia); also for Bosanski ≈†amac killings, Doboj massacre, Sanski Most killings, Srebrenica massacre and Zvornik massacre (in Bosnia and Herzegovina). Part of the charge, that Stani≈°iƒá was part of a \\"joint criminal enterprise\\" including former Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and other Serbian politicians, was concluded in the trial of Milan Martiƒá. The prosecution accused him of \\"attempting to create a Greater Serbia using the areas containing the Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats\\". One of the prosecution's crucial arguments and evidence that he and Simatoviƒá were directly responsible for the creation of the paramilitary units was a 1997 film taken in Special Operations Unit's headquarters where senior political and intelligence officials including Milo≈°eviƒá himself visited the unit, misrepresenting the history of the unit and its war record. In 2009, the trial has officially begun six years after Stani≈°iƒá's first court appearance. In the period from 2003 to 2013, Stani≈°iƒá spent many years in and out of jail, as he was granted the provisional release numerous times. ;Acquittal and appeal (2013‚Äì2017) Stani≈°iƒá and Simatoviƒá were acquitted of all charges on 30 May 2013, four years after the trial started and ten years after his extradition to the ICTY. However, his acquittal as well as that of Franko Simatoviƒá had been overturned on 15 December 2015 by a United Nations' ICTY Appeals Chamber which vacated the initial verdict deemed faulty as it was based on an insistence that the men could only be guilty if they \\"specifically directed\\" the crimes.Hague Court orders retrial for 2 aides of Miloseviƒá, New York Times, 16 December 2015. On 22 December 2015, Simatoviƒá and Stani≈°iƒá were granted temporary release. Back in Serbia, the two had to report to a local police station in Belgrade every day and surrender their passports to the Ministry of Justice of Serbia.\\"UN Court Frees Serbian Security Chiefs Before Trial\\", balkaninsight.com; accessed 25 December 2015. He and Simatoviƒá were on provisional release from December 2015 to June 2017. ;MICT retrial (2017‚Äìpresent) A new trial began on 13 June 2017, and is being handled by the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT), which took over the ICTY's remaining cases as it closes in December 2017. After the MICT's retrial opening statements, Stani≈°iƒá filed a request to follow the trial from home due to illness, which was granted and he has been on a provisional release since July 2017. However, the prosecution has not objected to motions regarding his provisional releases, which have been met with strict conditions.https://jrad.irmct.org/view.htm?r=245122&s;= Controversy The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) submitted a sealed document to the court attesting to his role as an undercover operative helping to bring peace to the region. Personal life During his professional career, he had several nicknames - Korƒçagin (Korchagin), Tukaƒçev (Tukhachev) and Ledeni (lit. Iceman). He was nicknamed Ledeni for the preternaturally cool demeanor and calmness he possessed while dealing with even the most complicated situations at work and in life. His former colleagues state that: \\"This outer tranquility hides the volcano inside\\". According to the ICTY's documents, Stani≈°iƒá is suffering from pouchitis (chronic disease of the digestive system) and depression.

He was a descendant of Kh√∂khechi, the fifth son of Kublai Khan.Zhang, Tingyu et al.History of Ming.vol.124 Before the fall of the Yuan Before the Yuan Dynasty's fall in 1368, Basalawarmi had been the Yuan Viceroy of Yunnan and Guizhou, in southwestern China. He held the title of Prince of Liang, a hereditary title passed down from one of his forebears, a son of Kublai Khan. Following the Ming Dynasty's overthrow of the Yuan, Basalawarmi, from his capital city of Kunming, led one of the last pockets of Mongol resistance to Ming rule in China. He was able to withhold the advance of other forces of his time due to the relatively remote location of his domain. Meanwhile, Emperor Taizu of Ming, the first emperor of the Ming dynasty, decided to approach Basalawarmi with an overture of peace, believing that conquering a remote region with force would be a costly action. The connection between Basalawarmi and the remaining Mongol empire was limited but not terminated. Ayusiridara Khan dispatched a messenger to Basalawarmi in order to confirm his sovereignty over Yunnan. Despite the fact that Basalawarmi was truly royal to the disintegrated Mongol empire, Yunnan was independent of any political forces during the reign of Basalawarmi. The King of Dali Duan Gong was married to the Mongol Borjigin princess Agai, daughter of the Yuan dynasty Mongol Prince of Liang, Basalawarmi. They had a son and a daughter, Duan Sengnu. their children were also called Duan Qiangna amd Duan Bao. Duan Sengnu raised Duan Bao to take revenge against Basalawarmi for the killing of Duan Gong. A play was made based on these events. According to Yuan documents, the Duan family were originally Han Chinese from Wuwei commamdery, Gansu. Other Duan families also originated from Wuwei. Defeat and death The Hongwu Emperor initially sent a diplomat, Wang Wei, to attempt to negotiate with Basalawarmi in 1372, but Basalawarmi executed Wang Wei in 1374 after negotiations broke down. The Hongwu Emperor then dispatched the generals Fu Youde and Ma Hua to deal with Basalawarmi. In 1381, Ma Hua attacked Basalawarmi from Guiyang while Fu Youde's deputies, Mu Ying and Lan Yu, attacked from another direction. The combined Ming forces, which numbered 300,000 men, met Basalawarmi's 100,000 units. Basalawarmi's forces were decisively defeated. Following his defeat, Basalawarmi drowned his wife, ordered his ministers to commit suicide, and committed suicide himself on January 6, 1382. After his death, his family was exiled to Tamna island of Korea according to the edict of Emperor Taizu of Ming. Zheng He Zheng He, the renowned Ming eunuch admiral and head of the Ming \\"treasure fleet\\", would rise to his position indirectly because of Basalawarmi's resistance to the Ming. Zheng He was born in Yunnan in 1371 while Basalawarmi ruled the province. The Ming army that had been sent to deal with Basalawarmi captured and castrated Zheng He at the age of 11 and brought him to the Ming imperial court. Mythical account In The Deer and the Cauldron, a novel written by Jin Yong, the main character retells a humorous mythical account of Basalawarmi's defeat. In this legend, Basalawarmi is said to have hundreds of war elephants, obtained from what is now Myanmar, in his army. The Ming general Ma Hua defeats Basalawarmi by unleashing ten thousand mice which drive Basalawarmi's war elephants to terror, alluding to the widespread myth that elephants are afraid of mice. Basalawarmi himself is not presented favorably; he is described as a drunken, fat, and cowardly old man.  See also  *Khatso - Mongols who remained in Yunnan after the death of Basalawarmi.

At that time city already had four different sports teams; for cross-country skiing (since 1882), gymnastics (since 1892), speed skating (since 1897) and football (since 1911) respectively. Its most prominent recent member is Morten Sand, who participated at the 2006 European Championships. Prominent former members include high jumper Astrid Tveit and long-distance runner Brynhild Synstnes. The club hosts the Veidekkelekene, the second largest athletics meet in Norway. History In 1973, Stampesletta opened, and the club moved from Sportsplassen i Lillehammer to there, with the old venue being retired in 1975.Lillehammer IF (1994): 50 In 1977, the club hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships at Stampesletta. It was the last time the championships were held on gravel, and this caused problems because excessive rain drowned the venue, and the fire department had to pump off the water. The club started planning fixed surface on the venue in 1980, and was granted a loan for NOK 500,000. On 18 August 1981, the municipal council voted to grant NOK 200,000 for the upgrade. The work was largely done with voluntary work, and the new surface was inaugurated on 28 August 1982 with the Norwegian Relay Athletics Championship.Lillehammer IF (1994): 49 The running track was renovated in 2003, and received a new surface layer and paint job. Lillehammer IF has hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships three times, in 1977, 1995 and 2009. They have also hosted a series of other Norwegian championships, such as the Norwegian Junior Athletics Championships in 1958, 1987 and 2002, and the Norwegian Relay Athletics Championships in 1960, 1974, 1976, 1982, 1991 and 1999. Veidekkelekene is an annual track and field tournament held at Stampesletta. In 2010 it had 1,150 participants and is organized by Lillehammer IF, Gausdal FIK and Moelven IL. The tournament is the second-largest track and field event in Norway, after Tyrvinglekene. Venue Lillehammer IF is based at Stampesletta, a multi-sports complex located from the town center. The track and field venue has eight lanes around the full course, as well as a start allowing 110 meter hurdling.

The C group fibers are unmyelinated and have a small diameter and low conduction velocity, whereas Groups A and B are myelinated. Group C fibers include postganglionic fibers in the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and nerve fibers at the dorsal roots (IV fiber). These fibers carry sensory information. Damage or injury to nerve fibers causes neuropathic pain. Capsaicin activates C fibre vanilloid receptors, giving chili peppers a hot sensation. Structure and anatomy Location C fibers are one class of nerve fiber found in the nerves of the somatic sensory system. They are afferent fibers, conveying input signals from the periphery to the central nervous system. Structure C fibers are unmyelinated unlike most other fibers in the nervous system. This lack of myelination is the cause of their slow conduction velocity, which is on the order of no more than . C fibers are on average 0.2-1.5 Œºm in diameter. Remak bundles C fiber axons are grouped together into what is known as Remak bundles. These occur when a non-myelinating Schwann cell bundles the axons close together by surrounding them. The Schwann cell keeps them from touching each other by squeezing its cytoplasm between the axons. The condition of Remak bundles varies with age. The number of C fiber axons in each Remak bundle varies with location. For example, in a rat model, large bundles of greater than 20 axons are found exiting the L5 dorsal root ganglion, while smaller bundles of average 3 axons are found in distal nerve segments. Multiple neurons contribute axons to the Remak bundle with an average ratio of about 2 axons contributed per bundle. The cross sectional area of a Remak bundle is proportional to the number of axons found inside it. Remak bundles in the distal peripheral nerve are clustered with other Remak bundles. The Remak Schwann cells have been shown to be electrochemically responsive to action potentials of the axons contained within them. In experiments where nerve injury is caused but nearby C fibers remain intact, increased spontaneous activity in the C fibers is observed. This phenomenon supports the theory that damaged nerve fibers may release factors that alter the function of neighboring undamaged fibers. Study of Remak bundles has important implications in nerve regeneration after sustaining injury. Currently, recovery of distal C fiber function takes months and may still only regain incomplete function. This may result in abnormal sensory function or neuropathic pain. Remak bundles are thought to release certain trophic factors that promote the regeneration of the damaged axons. Pathway C fibers synapse to second-order projection neurons in the spinal cord at the upper laminae of the dorsal horn in the substantia gelatinosa. The second-order projection neurons are of the wide dynamic range (WDR) type, which receive input from both nociceptive terminals as well as myelinated A-type fibers. There are three types of second order projection neurons in the spinothalamic tract: wide dynamic range (WDR), high threshold (HT), and low threshold (LT). These classifications are based on their responses to mechanical stimuli. The second-order neurons ascend to the brain stem and thalamus in the ventrolateral, or anterolateral, quadrant of the contralateral half of the spinal cord, forming the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract is the main pathway associated with pain and temperature perception, which immediately crosses the spinal cord laterally. This crossover feature is clinically important because it allows for identification of the location of injury. Function Because of their higher conduction velocity owing to strong myelination and different activation conditions, AŒ¥ fibers are broadly responsible for the sensation of a quick shallow pain that is specific on one area, termed as first pain. They respond to a weaker intensity of stimulus. C fibers respond to stimuli which have stronger intensities and are the ones to account for the slow, lasting and spread out second pain. These fibers are virtually unmyelinated and their conduction velocity is, as a result, much slower which is why they presumably conduct a slower sensation of pain. C fibers are considered polymodal because they can react to various stimuli. They react to stimuli that are thermal, or mechanical, or chemical in nature. C fibers respond to all kinds of physiological changes in the body. For example, they can respond to hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hypo-osmolarity, the presence of muscle metabolic products, and even light or sensitive touch. C fiber receptors include: *C fiber nociceptors **responsible for the second, burning pain *C fiber warming specific receptors **responsible for warmth *ultra-slow histamine-selective C fibers **responsible for itch *tactile C fibers **sensual touch **includes CT fibres, also known as C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTM), which are unmyelinated afferents found in human hairy skin, and have a low mechanical threshold < 5 milliNewtons. They have moderate adaptation and may exhibit fatigue on repetitive stimulation and \\"afterdischarges\\" for several seconds after a stimulus. *C mechano- and metabo- receptors in muscles or joints **responsible for muscle exercise, burn and cramp This variation of input signals calls for a variety of cells of the cortex in lamina 1 to have different modality-selectiveness and morphologies. These varying neurons are responsible for the different feelings we perceive in our body and can be classified by their responses to ranges of stimuli. The brain uses the integration of these signals to maintain homeostasis in the body whether it is temperature related or pain related. Vanilloid receptor The vanilloid receptor (VR-1, TRPV1) is a receptor that is found on the free nerve endings of both C and AŒ¥ fibers that responds to elevated levels of heat (>43 ¬∞C) and the chemical capsaicin. Capsaicin activates C fibers by opening a ligand-gated ion channel and causing an action potential to occur. Because this receptor responds to both capsaicin and heat, chili peppers are sensed as hot. VR-1 is also able to respond to extracellular acidification and can integrate simultaneous exposure to all three sensory stimuli. VR1 is essential for the inflammatory sensitization to noxious thermal stimuli. A second type of receptor, a vanilloid-like receptor (TRPV2,VRL-1), has a higher threshold of activation regarding heat of about 52 ¬∞C and also responds to capsaicin and low pH. Both types of receptors are transmembrane receptors that are closed during resting conditions. When open, these receptors allow for an influx of sodium and calcium which initiates an action potential across the fibers. Both receptors are part of a larger family of receptors called transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors. If damage to these heat transducer receptors occurs, the result can be chronic neuropathic pain caused by lowering the heat pain threshold for their phosphorylation. Role in neuropathic pain Activation of nociceptors is not necessary to cause the sensation of pain. Damage or injury to nerve fibers that normally respond to innocuous stimuli like light touch may lower their activation threshold needed to respond; this change causes the organism to feel intense pain from the lightest of touch. Neuropathic pain syndromes are caused by lesions or diseases of the parts of the nervous system that normally signal pain. There are four main classes: *peripheral focal and multifocal nerve lesions **traumatic, ischemic or inflammatory *peripheral generalized polyneuropathies **toxic, metabolic, hereditary or inflammatory *CNS lesions **stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury *complex neuropathic disorders **complex regional pain syndromes [CRPSs] After a nerve lesion of either C fibers or AŒ¥ fibers, they become abnormally sensitive and cause pathological spontaneous activity. This alteration of normal activity is explained by molecular and cellular changes of the primary afferent nociceptors in response to the nerve damage. The abnormal activity of the damaged nerves is associated with the increased presence of mRNA for voltage- gated sodium channels. Irregular grouping of these channels in sites of the abnormal activity may be responsible for lowering the activation threshold, thus leading to hyperactivity. Central sensitization After nerve damage or repeated stimulation, WDR (wide dynamic range) neurons experience a general increase in excitability. This hyper-excitability can be caused by an increased neuronal response to a noxious stimulus (hyperalgesia), a larger neuronal receptive field, or spread of the hyper-excitability to other segments. This condition is maintained by C fibers. C fibers cause central sensitization of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord in response to their hyperactivity. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon involves the release of glutamate by these pathologically sensitized C fibers. The glutamate interacts with the postsynaptic NMDA receptors, which aids the sensitization of the dorsal horn. Presynaptic neuronal voltage-gated N-calcium channels are largely responsible for the release of this glutamate as well as the neuropeptide, substance P. The expression of presynaptic neuronal voltage- gated N-calcium channels increases after a nerve lesion or repeated stimulation. NMDA receptor activation (by glutamate) enhances postsynaptic Nitric Oxide Synthase. Nitric Oxide is thought to migrate back to the presynaptic membrane to enhance the expression of the voltage-gated N-calcium channels resulting in a pain wind-up phenomenon. This abnormal central sensitization cycle results in increased pain (hyperalgesia) and pain responses from previously non-noxious stimuli evoke a pain response (allodynia). Central sensitization of the dorsal horn neurons that is evoked from C fiber activity is responsible for temporal summation of \\"second pain\\" (TSSP). This event is called ‚Äòwindup‚Äô and relies on a frequency greater or equal to 0.33Hz of the stimulus. Windup is associated with chronic pain and central sensitization. This minimum frequency was determined experimentally by comparing healthy patient fMRI‚Äôs when subjected to varying frequencies of heat pulses. The fMRI maps show common areas activated by the TSSP responses which include contralateral thalamus (THAL), S1, bilateral S2, anterior and posterior insula (INS), mid-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and supplemental motor areas (SMA). TSSP events are also associated with other regions of the brain that process functions such as somatosensory processing, pain perception and modulation, cognition, pre-motor activity in the cortex. Treatment Currently, the availability of drugs proven to treat neuropathic pain is limited and varies widely from patient to patient. Many developed drugs have either been discovered by accident or by observation. Some past treatments include opiates like poppy extract, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like salicylic acid, and local anesthetics like cocaine. Other recent treatments consist of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, although no substantial research on the actual mechanism of these treatments has been performed. However, patients respond to these treatments differently, possibly because of gender differences or genetic backgrounds. Therefore, researchers have come to realize that no one drug or one class of drugs will reduce all pain. Research is now focusing on the underlying mechanisms involved in pain perception and how it can go wrong in order to develop an appropriate drug for patients afflicted with neuropathic pain. Microneurography Microneurography is a technique using metal electrodes to observe neural traffic of both myelinated and unmyelinated axons in efferent and afferent neurons of the skin and muscle. This technique is particularly important in research involving C fibers. Single action potentials from unmyelinated axons can be observed. Recordings from efferent postganglionic sympathetic C fibers of the muscles and skin yield insights into the neural control of autonomic effector organs like blood vessels and sweat glands. Readings of afferent discharges from C nociceptors identified by marking method have also proved helpful in revealing the mechanisms underlying sensations such as itch. Unfortunately, interpretation of the microneurographic readings can be difficult because axonal membrane potential can not be determined from this method. A supplemental method used to better understand these readings involves examining recordings of post-spike excitability and shifts in latency; these features are associated with changes in membrane potential of unmyelinated axons like C fibers. Moalem-Taylor et al. experimentally used chemical modulators with known effects on membrane potential to study the post-spike super-excitability of C fibers. The researchers found three resulting events. Chemical modulators can produce a combination of loss of super-excitability along with increased axonal excitability, indicating membrane depolarization. Secondly, membrane hyperpolarization can result from a blockade of axonal hyperpolarization-activated current. Lastly, a non-specific increase in surface charge and a change in the voltage-dependent activation of sodium channels results from the application of calcium.

She was born at Constantinople on the July 7, 611 CE, baptized on August 15, and crowned (in the oratory of St. Stephen in the palace) October 4 of the same year. When she was about 15 years old, her father allied with the Western G√∂kt√ºrks and the Khazars against the Sassanian Persians and the Eurasian Avars. To secure the assistance of the Turks, Eudoxia was promised in marriage to either the Turkic ruler Ziebel (probably Tong Yabghu) or his son. She was afterwards sent to her Turkic husband, but the news of his death stopped her journey, and prevented the consummation of the marriage. Notes Resources * Artamonov, Mikhail. Istoriya Khazar.

Early life Born in Mobile, Alabama, Walker was first encouraged to become an artist by an elementary school teacher, Mayme Simpson. Forced at an early age to become the family breadwinner, Walker worked from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. daily for the Mobile & Ohio Freight Department, limiting his sleep so that he could devote more waking hours to the study of drawing and painting. He began his studies under Edmund C. DeCelle (misspelled in his letter as Cecile) of Mobile.Letter from John A. Walker to Henrietta Mary Thompson, University of Alabama, April 12, 1935 The St. Louis School of Fine Arts A company-ordered transfer to St. Louis proved fortuitous for Walker, enabling him to enroll in the St. Louis School of Fine Arts, where he studied under the direction of Victor Holm, Edmund Werpel and Frederick Greene Carpenter. After six years of study, he spent several years studying art in museums in New York and Chicago. Walker also was deeply influenced by the famed painter, illustrator and muralist Frank Brangwyn. According to a biography submitted to the University of Alabama in 1935, Walker exhibited his work at the fourteenth annual St. Louis Artists Guild Exhibition in 1926, followed by a \\"two-man\\" exhibition in Mobile in 1929 and a \\"one-man\\" exhibition at the Woman's Club in Mobile in 1933. Both Mobile exhibitions were sponsored by Allied Arts Guild of Mobile. The Woman's Club exhibition earned the following positive review in the Mobile Press-Register: > The water colors of John Augustus Walker on exhibition at the Woman's Club > House are among the most beautiful ever seen in Mobile. Exquisitely delicate > in handling and coloring, they are an outpouring of the sensitivity and > poetic spirit in which John Walker reacts to a beauty which is everywhere ‚Äì > a beauty from which so many now choose to turn away, seeking instead a > sordid viewpoint. After all, it is with the spirit with which one sees ‚Äì and > in these water colors John Walker translates transcendent beauty. Works Walker is remembered as an unusually tireless artist who labored long hours in his North Royal Street studio in Mobile. His paintings reflect a passion for bright colors, which he acquired from trips to Cuba and Key West ‚Äî a passion reinforced by subsequent trips throughout the United States and Gulf Coast region. Heavy dark outlines and painterly brushwork characterized both his commercial and public works. Walker's preferred subject matter ranged from Mardi Gras, fantasy and historical themes to landscapes and portraiture. Walker's watercolors are still prized throughout the Alabama Gulf Coast region. His paintings are displayed in many homes throughout the St. Louis area and throughout Alabama. Along the Gulf Coast, he is especially remembered for his murals in the old City Hall building in Mobile (now the Museum of Mobile), for the Smith Bakery murals on Dauphin Street in Mobile (now lost) and for his mural designs for the Federal Building Courtroom. Walker paintings also are displayed in numerous public schools throughout the state.\\"John Augustus Walker Murals\\". (February 28, 2007) Alabama Department of Archives and History - accessed March 5, 2009 Walker also earned an enduring reputation as a designer of floats, stage sets, and costumes for Mardi Gras. Many of the float designs, noted for their exquisite artwork, are still displayed in museums. Many of his works earned numerous local, state and national awards. He was a founder and original member of the Mobile Art Guild, which he also served as an instructor.\\"Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture, Alabama Cooperative Extension Service,\\" (Text that accompanied first public exhibition in the 1980s) Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture One of the products for which Walker is most distinguished is the Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture, funded by the Works Progress Administration and commissioned by the Alabama Extension Service (now Alabama Cooperative Extension System) for exhibition at the 1939 Alabama State Fair. Walker originally was contracted to paint 29 murals, although severe time constraints limited him to only ten. Assuming that the paintings would be only temporary, Walker used tempera water-color paints rather than costlier, more durable oils ‚Äî his preferred medium.Dupree, C. Bruce, Art Specialist, Alabama Cooperative Extension System, \\"Lecture on Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture,\\" Auburn University Sesquicentennial, Sept. 21, 2006. Following exhibition at the Alabama State Fair, the paintings were shipped to Shreveport for display at the 1939 Louisiana State Fair. Afterward, they were shipped to the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University) in Auburn and stored in the Duncan Hall attic for almost a half century before they were rediscovered in the 1980s and refurbished. Although these murals were designed to be only temporary, they are among the Alabama Cooperative Extension System's most valued historical artifacts and are considered prime examples of WPA-related art associated with the Great Depression era.Dupree, Bruce (Summer 2008) \\"John Augustus Walker and the Historical Panorama of Alabama Agriculture.\\" Alabama Heritage.

He was best known for his performances in 1994 when he won the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, the second and third legs of the Triple Crown Series. Background A son of Storm Cat, who in 2006 became the world's most expensive stallion, Tabasco Cat was out of the mare Barbicue Sauce. He was bred on a foal share partnership between Overbrook Farm owner William T. Young and Reynolds Metals Chairman David P. Reynolds. He was trained by D. Wayne Lukas and ridden by jockey Pat Day. Racing career 1993:two-year-old season Tabasco Cat's most important win as a 2-year- old came in the Fort Springs Stakes at Keeneland Race Course. In his last race of 1993, the colt finished third to winner Brocco in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. In December 1993, Tabasco Cat seriously injured Jeff Lukas, who worked for his father as an assistant trainer. In a shedrow accident at Santa Anita Park, the colt broke loose and when Jeff Lukas tried to stop him, the excited horse slammed into him with such force that it fractured his skull and left him in a coma for several weeks. Jeff Lukas suffered permanent brain damage; he had changes in personality, vision loss, and damage to his memory. By spring of 1994, he had recovered enough that he attempted to return to horse racing, but after a series of less-demanding jobs ending in 2003, it was clear he could not work safely around race horses. He also tried living and working near horse farms, but his disabilities were too severe for him to be safe around horses at all. He ultimately moved to Atoka, Oklahoma in 2007 to work for David Burrage, who had been the accountant and general manager for Lukas Racing Stables. At that time, Burrage was a banker and owned the First Bank in Atoka, which employed Lukas, who lived a quiet life until his death at age 58 in March 2016. 1994:three-year-old season In the spring of 1994, in the run-up to the U.S. Triple Crown series, Tabasco Cat won January's San Rafael Stakes and the El Camino Real Derby in March, then finished second to Brocco in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby. Sent to Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby, Tabasco Cat was sent off at more than 9:1 odds as the bettors third choice. Owner/trainer Warren A. Croll, Jr. had the heavy favorite in Holy Bull, with second choice going to Tabasco Cat's California nemesis, Brocco. At the start of the Kentucky Derby, eventual longshot winner Go for Gin ducked out, forcing Tabasco Cat into another horse. Although the colt recovered and rider Pat Day got him to within striking distance of the frontrunners, he tired in the stretch run and finished sixth. Brocco finished fourth, and Holy Bull was twelfth. Tabasco Cat went on to win the next two legs of the U.S. Triple Crown series, capturing both the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course and the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park. Go for Gin finished second in both races. In the fall of 1994, Tabasco Cat defeated Best Pal in winning the 1994 Kentucky Cup Classic Handicap. He finished third behind Holy Bull and Concern in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course and was second to the latter in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Stud career Retired to stud duty after his 3-year-old season, Tabasco Cat sired several stakes winners at Overbrook Farm. Among his notable offspring were the colt Snow Ridge, the multiple stakes winning filly Habibti, and another filly, Island Sand who earned more than $1.1 million and won several stakes races including the Grade I Acorn Stakes. In the fall of 2000, Tabasco Cat was sold to the Japan Bloodstock Breeders' Association and stood at their Shizunai Stallion Station until 2004, when he died at age thirteen from a heart attack while in the breeding shed. In all, Tabasco Cat sired twenty-one stakes race winners.http://www.bloodhorse.com/viewstory.asp?id=21116 Tabasco Cat's obituary at Bloodhorse.com Pedigree References Category:1991 racehorse births Category:2004 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Preakness Stakes winners Category:Belmont Stakes winners Category:American Grade 1 Stakes winners Category:Thoroughbred family 12-d Category:Reynolds family ","title":"Tabasco Cat"},{"id":"11747874","text":"Benjamin Laney may refer to: * Benjamin Lany (or Laney) (1591‚Äì1675), bishop * Benjamin Travis Laney (1896‚Äì1977), Democratic Governor of Arkansas ","title":"Benjamin Laney"},{"id":"11747875","text":"Benjamin Lacy is the name of: *Benjamin W.

Agua Hedionda means in Spanish \\"Foul Smelling Water\\", and is also the name of the residential neighborhood around the spa, with approximately 10,000 inhabitants. The name was likely due to sulfur in the water. Agua Hedionda  The Spa The waters originate from the melting snows of the Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl volcanoes. It is probable that the spring was visited since antiquity by the Olmecs, the Teotihuacans, the Chalca tribe, the Tlahuica tribe, and the Aztecs. Chemical analysis of the waters was made in the late 19th century and the current spa premises of Agua Hedionda were built by the Mexican government in 1928. Agua Hedionda is a popular tourist attraction with ancient trees and gardens, with many types of birds.

Although beginning as a small-scale event, it turned a major event in the history of the city, of Chechnya and of Russo-Chechen relations, starting a series of ethnic riots, to continue until 1965. Immediate and long-term causes The riots were provoked by the killing of one Russian by an Ingush. The Russian, a sailor, had asked an Ingush woman to dance and tried to seduce her, but an Ingush man who was engaged to her intervened and the ensuing confrontation escalated into a brawl in which the Russian ended up dead.Dunlop, John B. Russia confronts Chechnya: Roots of a Separatist Conflict. Pages 80-81 However, the real motive of the riots was inter-ethnic conflict between the Russians and Chechen returnees from deportation to Central Asia, most of whom were unemployed, as the Soviet rule did nothing to settle differences. The Russians had been living in the Grozny Oblast for 13 years before they returned in 1957 and resented their return, as they had been living in Vainakh houses on Vainakh land and doing jobs that had been done by Vainakh before the deportation. The return of the Vainakh (Chechens and Ingush) caused competition between the two groups over housing and jobs, which was overlaid with historical animosities, quickly escalating. Vainakh (especially Chechens) viewed Russians not only as oppressors but also as illegitimate interlopers living on stolen land. Russians meanwhile viewed Vainakh as being less than them, and furthermore as subversive agents of Turkish interests. Thus, the brawl and the death of the one Russian sailor was only the spark that lit the fuse leading to the formation of the Russian mob that rioted.Dunlop, John B. Russia confronts Chechnya: Roots of a Separatist Conflict. Pages 79-80 Events Demands to authorities by Russian gathering The riot started initially as an armed gathering of Russians following the funeral for the death of the Russian sailor. 10,000 Russians assembled in the main square of Grozny. A Russian female who claimed she had formerly been a member of the regional party committee and the Council of Ministers stood up and voiced the Russians' demands. They included the establishment of \\"Russian power\\", a mass search and disarming of all Chechens and Ingush (with those found with weapons to be shot on spot) and then the re- expulsion of the Chechens and Ingush. On August 27 (the fifth day of the riot), a number of Russians made the following proposal to the Communist authorities: > Taking into consideration the appearance of a savage attitude by the side of > the Chechen-Ingush population towards the people of other nationalities, as > expressing itself in massacre, murders, violence and harassment, the working > people of the town of Grozny in the name of the majority of the population > propose: * 1. Since 27 August, to rename the CI ASSR into Grozny Oblast or > be it then Multinational Soviet Socialist Republic. * 2. In the Grozny > Oblast, Chechen-Ingush population is not to be permitted to exceed 10% of > the whole population. * 3. To transfer from other republics the front line, > progressive Komsomol youth of different nationalities in order to develop > the riches of the Grozny Oblast and to develop the agriculture. * 4.

Armed Russian mob and the Red Headbands There was evidence of pre-planning in the mob- the Russians of the city (including the communists) pinned red headbands upon their heads so that they would not be taken for Vainakh.Nekrich. Punished Peoples. Pages 152-153 The crowd beat to death at least one elderly Chechen from Urus-Martan while the law enforcement officials stood by and watched. They stormed the government offices, calling for restoration of the Grozny Oblast and the regulation of the Chechens' return from exile. The mob escalated its actions further and further. A crowd of 500 people attacked the post office, and demanded an audience with the central Soviet government in Moscow. The crowd then went to a long-distance telephone station, but was unable to reach Moscow still. At 23:00 on the 27th, the mob marched on the railway station. Their goal was to spread the word to their \\"brothers\\" (i.e. other Russian inogorods and Cossacks) of what they deemed to be the failure of their authorities to put the Chechens and Ingush in their place (though the Russians simply referred to both peoples collectively as \\"Chechens\\" or \\"bandits\\"). Throughout the whole affair, the non-Russians of the republic did not retaliate and showed large amounts of self-restraint, perhaps hoping against hope that the Russians would be stopped. The authorities only intervened, however, when the Russian/Cossack band began looting government buildings (i.e. the post office, the telephone station and the train station). The authorities, up until this point, had been largely sympathetic to the goals of the protesters (and many even participated), not in least because they were all ethnic Russians themselves. However, the capture of the train station by the Russians and Cossacks was the last straw. Around the midnight after August 27, they approached the protester-held train station, hoping to reestablish law and order without a fight. However, the Russian mob, already highly excited, began pelting them with stones and various hard objects. In the end, the protesters left the station and life returned to normal. Although the protest was condemned as \\"chauvinistic\\" and \\"anti-Soviet\\", none were held accountable for their actions later, and the new regional government afterwards adopted a policy of viewing all Chechen aspirations as Turkish agent work and admiration for the brutal conquerors of Chechnya such as Yermolov.

A connection from Flagg Mountain south to the Florida-Georgia border is considered \\"Phase II Development\\". It is a potential connector in the US National Trails System, linking the Florida National Scenic Trail in the south to the North Country National Scenic Trail in New York.

As an amateur, he won the 2007 U.S. National Championships at the age of 17 and represented the United States the following year at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Personal life Molina's father, Miguel, had a successful amateur boxing career in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico, before he migrated to the United States. His older brother Carlos is a highly regarded prospect with a 17-1-1 record, and his twin brother, Oscar Molina, fights on the Mexican Olympic team. Amateur career With a Vicente Fern√°ndez ring entrance song of \\"No Me Se Rajar\\", a tune that reflects the macho culture that prevails in Mexico, Molina finished his amateur career with a record of 111-12. He won a bronze medal at the 2006 Cadet World Championships at lightweight and a national title at the 2006 Junior Olympic International Invitational. He knocked down Karl Dargan (a two-time 141-pound U.S. champion and winner of the 2007 Pan American Games) twice at the U.S. championships. He then won against Jeremy Bryan and Dan O'Connor, followed by Brad Solomon in the finals, to win the junior welterweight title. At the World Championships in 2007, he beat Azerbaijan's Emil Maharramov, the 2005 bronze medalist, 27-10, but lost to England's 2008 Olympian Bradley Saunders. 2008 Olympics At the Olympic qualifier, Molina beat Myke Carvalho and then sealed his qualification with a win over Canada's Kevin Bizier. He lost his Olympic debut 1:14 to Boris Georgiev of Bulgaria. According to at least one doctor, it was a fight that never should have taken place. After it was over, Coach Dan Campbell said Molina had gone into the bout with a small hole in his lung, which allowed air to seep out beneath the skin. Professional career Molina is signed to the promotional company Goossen Tutor. In his third fight, he got a second round K.O. over veteran Miguel Garcia.

In 1973, Carolyn tried out for a spot in the Ypsilanti American Little League in Ypsilanti, Michigan, despite the fact that Little League had a rule that specifically prohibited girls from trying out. The league president allowed her to try out anyway, and after Carolyn beat out 15 boys for a starting position, the manager of the Orioles selected Carolyn for his team.

The local league relented, and on May 10, 1973, Carolyn took the field at Candy Cane Park as a member of the Orioles.

Overview In contrast to the previous three Battles of the Isonzo (June, July and October), this offensive lasted a short amount of time, and is sometimes considered a continuation of the previous offensive. Most of the clash was concentrated in the direction of Gorizia and on the Kras Plateau, though the push was distributed on the whole Isonzo front. The Italian Second Army, aiming for the town of Gorizia, was able to capture the hilly area around Oslavia and San Floriano del Collio overlooking the Soƒça (Isonzo) and Gorizia itself. The Italian Third Army, covering the rest of the front up to the sea, launched a series of large and bloody attacks which brought no significant gain. Mount Sei Busi, already the scene of bitter fighting, was attacked five times by the Italian forces, always in vain. The intensity of the fighting increased until the end of November, when the bridgehead of Tolmin (Italian: Tolmino) was heavily bombed by both sides and the casualty ratio per day reached its apex. In the first fifteen days of December, however, the fighting was reduced to small scale skirmishes as opposed to the massive frontal assaults that characterized the previous phases of the battle. An unsigned truce arrived together with the first great cold in the mountains of the Kras, and operations were ceased due to lack of supplies. The Austro-Hungarian High Command, worried by the huge losses, requested assistance from the German Empire, which was not yet formally in the war against Italy. This would eventually lead to German intervention on the Italian front starting with the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo.

Upon completion, the entire highway will span approximately from Highway 16 to Highway 43. The constructed portion of the highway consists of the final of the route from the Athabasca River to Highway 43.  Route description  The constructed portion of Highway 947 begins at the north bank of the Athabasca River, which serves at the boundary between Woodlands County to the south and the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16 to the north. It is preceded by a bridge and a series of private resource roads that provides access to oil and gas facilities on the south side of the Athabasca River. Proceeding north, the highway terminates at Highway 43, approximately southeast of the Town of Fox Creek. Once fully constructed, Highway 947 will begin at Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) within Yellowhead County, approximately west of the Town of Edson, and will be preceded by Highway 47.  History   Original alignment  Highway 947 was first designated in the early 1970s, but in a different alignment. At that time, the highway began at Highway 16 within Edson. It traveled northeast using the general alignment that is now designated Highway 748, and then north to Swan Hills via Whitecourt using the general alignment that is now designated Highway 32\\\\. From Swan Hills, it continued north to Highway 2 using the general alignment that is now designated Highway 33. By the mid-1970s however, the portion of this original alignment of Highway 947 from Edson to present day Highway 32 was renumbered to Highway 748, while the balance of this original alignment to Highway 2 was renumbered to Highway 932.  Current alignment  In the mid-1970s, after the original Highway 947 was renumbered to Highway 748 and Highway 932, the Highway 947 designation was applied to the current alignment of the highway from the Athabasca River to Highway 43. Previously at a gravel standard, this segment of the highway was paved in 2009. The balance of this highway was planned by the Province of Alberta and identified as a future resource highway in the 1980s, but economic constraints prevented its construction.  Future  Headed by Yellowhead County, the most recent lobby effort to construct the balance of Highway 947 began in late 2010. In early 2011, the lobby effort expanded to the Grande Alberta Economic Region, an alliance of 12 municipalities, to which the towns of Edson and Fox Creek have obliged. As part of its lobbying efforts, Yellowhead County has committed to constructing the first of Highway 947 (Range Road 183) north Highway 16 to a paved standard with a scheduled completion of 2013. Alberta Transportation approached the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in 2014 to determine if a federal environmental assessment would be required to construct and operate the highway extension.

It was designed by Ton van de Ven and was the first attraction built outside the Fairy Tale Forest. History and details On July 24, 1976 the announcementDocumentariaat de Efteling The date of announcement (July 24, 1976) also marks the official date of foundation of Documentariaat De Efteling, largest privately held collection and source of information concerning the Efteling Themepark on the making of the world's biggest haunted castle appeared in Brabant's daily newspaper, Het Brabants Dagblad. The article mentions that the castle would be built between the Fairy Tale Forest and the rowing and canoeing pond. This was a strategic choice, because the location of the attraction would attract visitors to the normally ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô southern part of the park. The main reason for this mega- attraction was declining numbers of visitors at Efteling. Aiming for a more general public, with an attraction that didn‚Äôt depend on the weather conditions, Efteling authorized their young designer Van de Ven to start designing the ride. Van de Ven designed the castle as a walk-through attractionOfficial site and, in the style of Anton Pieck, the castle was designed to look old and decayed. It is meant to look as though it was once beautiful and majestic, but is now haunted and in ruins and somewhat romantic. The construction took about 18 months and the castle was officially opened May 10, 1978. On May 12 a television special was broadcast with Kate Bush singing in and around the castle. She had a big hit around the globe with \\"Wuthering Heights\\" at the time.Kate Bush' television special, filmed in the Efteling Ride statistics *Ride time: 6:27 minutes *Capacity: 800 visitors per hour (estimated) *Cost: ‚Ç¨1,588,823 (40% overspent)Fansite (in Dutch) Ride details Looking closely at the exterior of the Spookslot, a number of faces can be seen in the ruins. The largest can be seen above the main entrance: two windows are the eyes and the entrance itself is a gaping mouth, through which the visitors enter. When it rains, one window appears to be crying. Two of the tombstones outside the mansion carry the logos of the National Railway Organisation and the Rabobank. The waiting hall is a dimly-lit area, with several spooky items, of which an eastern ghost with a crystal bowl is the most notable. The glass uses the pepper's ghost technique to show a beautiful woman turning into a skull. Another famous effect, added in 1979, are dogs lying behind a door, who start to rattle their chains when someone pulls the doorknob. In the tower area a hairy arm stretches from the roof, holding a big chandelier. Once in a while one might have a glimpse of three horrible demonlike creatures, (vlederikken) leering down at the visitors. Upon entering the main attraction hall, a number of scary statues and scenes prepare the audience for the main course: a look into the inner court, graveyard, and the ruins of a monastery at night. When the clock strikes twelve, a violin (a uv lighted animatronic) starts playing the Danse Macabre of Saint-Sa√´ns and the graveyard comes to life and a number of skeletons and ghosts are visible. One tombstone is labeled in Latin \\"Puella Innocenta\\" (innocent girl). The years on her stone (in Roman numbering) reveal that she has been living backwards in time, however, it is possible that it is merely a mistake of the artist who made the stone. There is also a tombstone inside the mansion with the name \\"Den Hegarty\\", an Irish rock singer who happened to be on the radio when the stone was made. Also, it is said that the main show's appearance was influenced by the 1971 horror film \\"Tombs of the Blind Dead\\". Music The main theme of the show is a shortened version of the Danse Macabre by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. The movements of the animatronics are synchronized with the music; the violin that opens and closes the main part of the show demonstrates this. The show itself has been adapted four times. During the opening season in 1978, the show lasted about 12 minutes. Three months later it was cut back to 8 minutes. In 1987 the show was renewed and in 1989 the final version was completed. Leading up to the Dance Macabre is a prelude which contains - as part of the soundscape - two pieces of music: \\"Claws\\" was composed by Marc Rosen in the '80s for the Stock-music-library Omnimusic. \\"Terza Et√†\\", from the album \\"Citt√† Notte\\" (1972) was composed by Egisto Macchi. \\"Terza Et√†\\" was already used before in the first version of the show at its premiere in 1978.

He was also a member of the March 14 Coalition.  Early life and education Eido was born on 2 April 1942 to a Sunni Muslim family in the Bachoura neighborhood of Beirut. He graduated from Lebanese University with a degree in law in 1966, and became a magistrate in 1967. Career and activities Eido was a member of the Sunni Murabetoun militia during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. In the late 1990s, he was north Lebanon's public prosecutor, but he had to resign for being able to go into politics and run for elections with rafic Hariri He was later named as President of the Beirut Court of Appeal, a role from which he resigned in 2000 to be a candidate to the parliamentary elections on the same year. While on Rafik Hariri's list, a then-unknown Walid Eido was elected as a representative of Beirut's second constituency in 2000 and in 2005. After Syria's withdrawal of Lebanon, Eido became a critic of Syrian President Bashar Assad and Lebanese President √âmile Lahoud. He was the head of the defense committee and a member of several others in the parliament. On 6 April 2007, Eido asked Lebanon's prime minister Fouad Siniora to end the current standoff and replace the resigned ministers. Eido said \\"it is time to end this resignation mockery by replacing the resigned ministers in accordance with the constitution so that the government can go back to work.\\" Eido was a supporter of the tribunal and a close friend of Rafik Hariri. Following the 2006 Lebanon War, Eido reportedly said: ‚ÄúWe will sell our blood to buy weapons and confront [Hezbollah]. We will never let them control the country.\\"  Assassination  A parked Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel vehicle packed with 80 kg (177 lbs) of explosives blew up as Eido's car was driving away from a Beirut beach club on 13 June 2007, killing him and six other people. His eldest son Khaled was also killed in the blast. Eido was 65 years old. Several citizens were also killed, two of whom were Nejmeh footballers,Nejmeh Club, Lebanon Hussein Naeem and Hussein Dokmak. The explosion occurred at the Manara district of western Beirut late afternoon. The bomb detonated around 5:30 pm on a side street between the Nejmeh Football Club and the Luna Park amusement center along Beirut's Corniche, a seaside road dotted with tourist and family destinations such as beach resorts, hotels, and caf√©s. Eido was assassinated just three days after the UN Security Council Resolution 1757 came into effect, mandating the establishment of a hybrid Lebanese-international tribunal to investigate suspects of the Hariri assassination and other similar attacks. He was the seventh anti-Syrian politician and third member of the Lebanese parliament killed since the assassination of Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. The death of Walid Eido reduced then March 14 alliance's parliamentary majority to 68 out of 126 MPs total. The assassination was condemned by the UN Security Council.  Personal life  Eido was married and a father of three sons, Khaled, Zaher and Mazen. Eido was an avid swimmer. His late eldest son Khaled was a lawyer.

Other philatelic items, such as plate blocks, miniature sheets, covers, lettersheets, etc., can be stored in stockbooks. Construction Stockbooks consist of a number of stiff pages, made up with horizontal pockets of manilla paper, glassine paper or clear film, into which stamps are placed.Basics of Stamp Collecting: Stockbook or Album? (retrieved 10 June 2007) Collectors can insert stamps side by side in a row or can overlap stamps when individual viewing is not necessary. The pages, usually double-sided, are bound into book form. The most popular sizes comprise between 4 and 32 double-sided pages with each page interleaved with a glassine, or clear, sheet to prevent stamps on adjacent pages from touching. As with most stationery, most manufacturers refer to the number of sides in a stockbook and not to the number of pages, so stockbook advertised as a \\"16-page stockbook\\" contains 8 double-sided cardboard pages.StampoRama: Stamp Album and Storage FAQ (retrieved 10 June 2007) Stock pages A ring-binder of loose-leaf stock pages - with deep pouches that make interleaving unnecessary and holds stamps securely Some collectors require more flexibility than a bound stockbook allows, because moving individual stamps from page to page can be time consuming and may cause damage. Several manufacturers produce individual stock pages that can be inserted into loose-leaf folders.StampoRama: What are stock pages? (retrieved 10 June 2007) Stock pages are usually sold in packages of multiple sheets of 5 or 10 to a packet.Linns.com: Even stamp collectors need the right tools (retrieved 10 June 2007) Stock pages are made from plastic or thick card. In either case they have clear pockets on one or both sides. These pockets are attached on three sides with the top side being open to insert the stamps. On some sheets the pockets are attached to the page on one side only, that is the bottom side. The sides are left unattached so that the pocket can be lifted open to place a stamp or a philatelic item. This arrangement reduces the chance of damage, since unlike in a three-side-attached stock page the stamps are not inserted or pushed into a pocket. Advantages and disadvantages * As more stamps are acquired they can easily be rearranged. * There is no need to use stamp hinges. * Large gaps need not exist, as may happen with a stamp album that has fixed spaces for each particular stamp. * There is no space for writing notes - some collectors do their write-up on a piece of paper and insert it behind a stamp or in an adjacent row. * Stamps are not affixed so they can fall out, or become dislodged, if dropped or bumped hard.StampoRama: What are the advantages of stock pages? (retrieved 10 June 2007) * Stockbooks are less suitable for display since the stamps can fall out or be mishandled.

It is a device for measuring changes in the dimensions of a specimen, optically, the achieved resolution can result in greater values than those of a conventional pushrod dilatometer. A monochromatic light source, such as a laser, illuminates the specimen. Some of the light is reflected by the specimen and interferes with the incoming light, creating optical interference fringes. As the specimen contracts or expands, there is a proportional movement of the interference fringes, which can be measured using a camera system. The measurement resolution is determined by the wavelength of the light, and is typically 0.5 Œºm for blue light. Optical dilatometers are used to measure thermal expansion. The optical dilatometer is in fact complementary to the traditional higher resolution push rod dilatometer when it comes to measure dimensional changes of materials, as a function of temperature, and no contact between specimen and instrument is required.  Structure and types  The most recent types of optical dilatometer use a direct-beam system so as to avoid contact-related problems by measuring the image that the specimen projects on an image sensor, when irradiated by a light beam. By using a single beam of light with short wavelength and a very high resolution image sensor it is possible to achieve good resolutions, although not comparable to those of the standard dilatometers. For example, using a blue light with a wavelength below 1500 micrometers, it is possible to achieve images with an actual resolution of nearly 1500 micrometers/pixel of the camera (not an interpolated resolution but an actual resolution). By using two light beams, which illuminate two small portions of material at the extremities of the sample, set perpendicularly to the beams direction, it is then possible to achieve an absolute measurement of longitudinal variation while heat-treating the specimen. There are two major types of optical dilatometers which are currently in use: * Horizontal Optical Dilatometer: the rod-specimen is laid horizontally on the sample holder and, during the thermal treatment in the oven, it is completely free to expand and contract. The displacement of the sample holder is not relevant for the result of the measurement because the optical system follows the horizontal movements of small portions of the specimen at its extremities. * Vertical Optical Dilatometer: the rod-specimen is set vertically on the sample holder (alumina thin plate) and while one camera ‚Äúwatches‚Äù the top of the plate the other follows the vertical displacements of the sample‚Äôs top edge. This system has been used so far to find the characteristic temperatures (phase transitions, maximum sintering speed, swelling, etc.) of ceramic materials. In fact, phase transitions are always associated to dimension variation of the material: sintering is accompanied by high shrinkages, related to the decrease of porosity -swelling usually appears at high temperatures. After sintering occurs and the viscosity of the ceramics formulation strongly decreases and trapped gas is then free to exit.  History  The first optical dilatometer was invented by Abbe and Fizeau in the second half of 19th century. This design has a reflected beam of monochromatic light and the measurement of the displacement is carried out by counting the interference fringes between the forward going beam and the reflected beam. After the Abbe invention, many improvements were achieved on the original design and there are now many models available on the market, which use modern optics and designs. Over the last five decades, interest has grown in the use of thermomechanical technologies for characterising materials in different fields of science and engineering. In particular, the use of optical methods has been playing a role in the field of ceramics and have been used to measure the coefficient of thermal expansion of bodies and glazes in order to ensure an optimal match of their thermomechanical behaviour.  Applications and fields of research  In order to measure thermal expansion up to high temperatures, the material to be tested has to be set on a sample holder inside an oven which has its own thermal expansion. In order to achieve a good accuracy it is necessary to measure the expansion of the sample holder and to subtract it from the actual expansion of the specimen. The best approach is to split the laser beam into two beams of light, which are reflected by the top-edge of the sample and by the top-edge of the sample holder, or by both longitudinal edges of the specimen. By detecting the longitudinal variations at both the extremities of the specimen the measurement achieved is absolute and there is no need for further corrections. This is the most accurate way of measuring thermal expansion and it may attain nanometric resolution. This is the type of instrument used by the suppliers of certified standard materials. For example, the National Institute for Standards and Technology uses a Fizeau double-beam interferometer to certify the thermal expansion of their certified reference materials. This method has proved to be very accurate, with a resolution of a fraction of the wavelength of the incident light, but it is limited by the reflectivity of the surface of the specimen. If the specimen is not reflective, or it becomes non reflective during the test, it is then necessary to use a mirror, which is set in contact with the specimen by using a refractory push rod. By doing so such method loses the advantage of being non contact and becomes substantially similar to the electronic dilatometer. Optical dilatometers are used along traditional dilatometers in ceramics for non-destructive testing of a sample's behavior during a thermal treatment. Optical dilatometers are used for thermal analysis of various types of materials, such as incoherent materials (expansion and contraction of an incoherent granular frit, as applied, for example, on raw tiles) and polymers (behaviour above the glass transition temperature, where the surface tension starts pulling the edges and making the sample shrink), as well as for analysis of various processes in materials manufacturing, for example, sintering kinetics, thermal expansion and sintering behaviour of thin glaze layer or polymer thin films.

The citadel is in the background. The Siege of Lille (12 August ‚Äì 10 December 1708) was the salient operation of the 1708 campaign season during the War of the Spanish Succession. After an obstinate defence of 120 days, the French garrison surrendered the city and citadel of Lille, commanded by Marshal Boufflers, to the forces of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene. The siege was famous among contemporaries for l'affaire des poudres (\\"the gunpowder incident\\"), where the Chevalier de Luxembourg with 2,000 horsemen passed through the Allied lines and succeeded in delivering 40,000 pounds of desperately needed gunpowder to the defenders. The siege was made possible by the defeat of the French army at the Battle of Oudenarde and the landing in Ostend of large amounts of ammunition and food after the Battle of Wijnendale. For most of the campaign, Eugene commanded the forces besieging Lille, while Marlborough commanded the forces covering those forces against external French interference. For a short period in late September however, after Eugene was injured on the 21st, Marlborough took command of both the besiegers and the covering force. On 22 October the Allies entered the city at the staggering cost of 12,000 casualties; Boufflers continued to resist from Lille's citadel for several weeks, exacting an additional 4,000 allied casualties.Chandler (1986), p. 89 While the allies' deft manoeuvring frustrated French attempts to relieve their precious fortress--the last substantial French bastion in northern Flanders--Boufflers' valiant defence likewise prolonged the siege well into winter, to the point where no operations could be undertaken against France that year.Treasure (1985), p. 279, notes: \\"Boufflers defended Lille with inspiring determination, aided by old Vauban who had designed its fortification and now lent his services as a simple volunteer. The allies were made to pay dearly for the city which did not capitulate till December.\\" The French garrison of Lille capitulated on 10 December and the remaining defenders marched out with full honours of war,Specifically, the articles of capitulation drafted by Marshal Boufflers on 9 December and accepted by Prince Eugene were: *The Lille citadel's chapel would not be used for the worship of any but the Catholic faith; *Lille's garrison would exit the citadel with horse, arms and baggage; *The garrison would traverse allied lines drums beating, bearing arms, and would carry in its train 6 cannons; *Each French soldier would depart with 12 musket shot; *French sick and wounded would be conducted to Douai at allied expense and Boufflers was decorated by Louis XIV. For France, the results of the siege were mixed. The city's stubborn defence tied down Marlborough for the remainder of the 1708 campaigning season, preventing him from inflicting further damage on France in the aftermath of Oudenarde. But, with the loss of Lille, northern Flanders reverted to allied control; the Allies moved against Ghent, taking the city in late December. The fall of Lille also opened a corridor for an allied invasion of France in 1709, but this effort would run into a bloody standstill at the Battle of Malplaquet.

It stems from evidence that individuals with dyslexia tend to do poorly on tests which measure their ability to decode nonsense words using conventional phonetic rules, and that there is a high correlation between difficulties in connecting the sounds of language to letters and reading delays or failure in children. The basic hypothesis is that reading failure or dyslexia stems from a functional or structural deficit in left hemispheric brain areas associated with processing the sounds of language. Some researchers have studied the structure and function of neural pathways in the language areas of the brain. Others have focused on the perception of short or rapidly varying sounds of language, positing that the core deficit is one of timing rather than of overall function. In the past two decades, the phonological deficit hypothesis has been the dominant explanation favored by researchers as to the probable cause of dyslexia, but it is only one of several competing theories. Critics of the phonological hypothesis point out that it fails to account for symptoms of dyslexia unrelated to phonetic decoding difficulties, such as problems with short-term memory, visual processing issues, or difficulties with balance and small motor coordination that are common to many dyslexic children and adults. They also argue that much of the evidence for the theory is based on circular reasoning, in that phonological weakness is seen as both a defining symptom of dyslexia and as its underlying cause.

As the office included the duties of lieutenant governor at that time, Dickerson occasionally served as the acting governor of Guam during his term. Prior to entering politics, Dickerson worked as a journalist in Nevada and eventually became a newspaper publisher and editor. He later served as the head of the U.S. Congressional Printing Committee until his retirement in 1980. Biography On April 23, 1914, Dickerson was born in Carson City at Nevada State Prison, where his father, Denver Sylvester Dickerson, was the warden as well as the former governor of the state. His father died in November 1925, when the younger Dickerson was 11 years old. Dickerson attended the public school system and received his bachelor's degree from the University of Nevada. He became a journalist for the Reno Evening Gazette. Following in his father's footsteps, Dickerson eventually owned the Carson City Chronicle and the Nevada State News.

Avoiding idling time has a multitude of benefits including: savings in fuel and maintenance costs, extending vehicle life, and reducing damaging emissions. An idling engine consumes only enough power to keep itself and its accessories running, therefore, producing no usable power to the drive train. For cargo ships, the need to run the ship's engines for power in port is eliminated by techniques collectively described as cold ironing. Idle reduction equipment is aimed at reducing the amount of energy wasted by idling trucks, rail locomotives or automobiles. When a vehicle's engine is not being used to move the vehicle, it can be shut off entirely ‚Äî thereby conserving fuel and reducing emissions‚Äî while other functions like accessories and lighting are powered by an electrical source other than the vehicle's alternator. Each year, long-duration idling of truck and locomotive engines emits 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, 200,000 tons of oxides of nitrogen, and 5,000 tons of particulate matter into the air.What SmartWay Can Do For You: Idling Reduction There are other technologiesIdle Reduction Related Links that can reduce the use of fuel to heat or cool the cab when the vehicle is traditionally idling overnight. These can be battery or fuel powered but in either case, use less fuel, do no harm to the vehicle's engine, and reduce or eliminate emissions. Other vehicles, including police, military, service trucks, news vans, fire trucks, ambulances, and hydraulic bucket trucks can be equipped with mobile power idle reduction systems, similar to a rechargeable battery. The systems are usually installed in the trunk and can provide up to 10 hours of additional power for equipment operation without engine engagement. When used by law enforcement and the military, idle reduction technology increases mission capability by extending operational time and providing increased situational awareness and safety. Idle reduction is a rapidly growing trend in US federal, state, local and fleet policy. Idling contributes significantly to the transportation sector's portion of yearly greenhouse gas emissions. The US Department of Energy is putting forth a huge effort through the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program to increase public awareness about decreasing petroleum use; idle-reduction being one of the methods. The Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center is a reliable resource for information regarding idle-reduction methods such as fuel-operated heaters, auxiliary power units and truck stop electrification.http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/idle_reduction_electrification.html Background and problem In the public sector, idling is common. Police officers, public works employees, fire fighters, and EMTs who operate city fleet vehicles run them at idle to perform their duties which require them to operate equipment. The emissions generated from these tasks by cities all over the U.S. contribute to the fact that each year U.S. passenger cars, light trucks, medium-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles consume more than 6 billion gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline ‚Äî without even moving. As fuel prices continue to rise, a major challenge in fleet management is how to keep service vehicles on the road to serve the public while staying within budget. Idle reduction is particularly significant for vehicles in heavy traffic and trucks at the estimated 5,000 truck stops in the US. Many hybrid electric vehicles employ idle reduction to achieve better fuel economy in traffic. America's fleet of around 500,000 long-haul trucksWhat is idle reduction? consumes over a billion gallons (3.8√ó109 l; 830 million imp gal) of diesel fuel per year.Dead link The trucking industry has analyzed the impact of idling on engines, both in terms of maintenance and engine wear costs. Long- duration idling causes more oil and oil filter deterioration and increases the need for more oil and filter changes. Similarly, the longer the idling time, the sooner the engine itself will need to be rebuilt. The trucking industry estimates that long duration idling costs the truck owner $1.13 per day, based on the need for more frequent oil changes and sooner overhaul costs. Services such as AireDock, IdleAire and ShorepowerShorepower provide power at truck stops to resting truckers who would otherwise need to continue idling during mandatory breaks. Because the United States Department of Transportation mandates that truckers rest for 10 hours after driving for 11 hours, truckers might park at truck stops for several hours. Often they idle their engines during this rest time to provide their sleeper compartments with air conditioning or heating or to run electrical appliances such as refrigerators or televisions. The problem of anti-idling is most commonly associated with heavy duty diesel engines because they are the biggest contributors when idling. As an example of the need for idling an engine, school bus drivers on a cold morning may go out to their bus and turn it on to warm up the engine in order to provide direct heat to the cabin when they return to their bus to start their morning routes, which brings up two of the main reasons for idling, driver mentality and the need for passenger comfort. This idling period can be considered excessive, though excessive idling is defined and regulated differently in different parts of the country. In the United States  Policies at the federal level are more focused towards research and development of technologies, economic incentives, and education. The Department of Energy (DOE) is sponsoring several corporate companies in the R&D; of new anti-idling technologies with the hope that this technology will be installed and incorporated in the assembly line or possibly at the dealer as an option.http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/idling_news/sep04_network_news.pdf The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also has many ways to promote idle reduction. The EPA established the SmartWay Transport Partnership that provides information about available anti-idling technologies, possible strategies for idle reduction, and resources for obtaining financing on anti- idling projects. The program also serves as an EnergyStar-like program with a label available to companies that commit ‚Äúto improve the environmental performance of their freight delivery operations.‚Äù http://www.epa.gov/SmartwayLogistics/transport/what-smartway/swtp.htm The EPA has a national campaign called the Clean School Bus Campaign which works to reduce diesel fuel consumption in school buses across the nation. Several regions were awarded millions of dollars through grant projects including idle-reduction pilot projects. Various states and localities have passed laws pertaining to idling. Some of the laws are more strict and stringent than others. Thirty-one states currently have some sort of existing regulations pertaining to anti-idling. Of these states, California has the most codes and regulations. The California Air Resources Board has enacted numerous laws that regulate idling in the state. For example, in Virginia, the excessive idling threshold is ten minutes, though, in many west coast states such as Hawaii and California, where there is a larger presence of greener policies in relation to fuel consumption, the thresholds are drastically smaller and may even have no idling tolerance at all. According to Hawaii Administrative Rules ¬ß11-60.1-34, no idling is permitted ‚Äúwhile the motor vehicle is stationary at a loading zone, parking or servicing area, route terminal, or other off street areas‚Äù http://www.epa.gov/smartway/documents/420b06004.pdf with a couple of exceptions. ‚ÄúEach year, long-duration idling of truck and locomotive engines consumes over of diesel fuel and emits 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, 200,000 tons of oxides of nitrogen, and 5,000 tons of particulate matter into the air.‚Äù http://epa.gov/smartway/transport/what-smartway/idling-reduction.htm At the local level, there are many municipalities that have enacted anti- idling regulations. New York is an example of states making their idling policies more strict. In early 2009, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation that reduced the amount of time non-emergency vehicles could idle when they are located near schools. The new legislation reduced the allowed idling time from three minutes to one minute. In addition, the new law authorized the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Department of Sanitation to enforce the new idling laws. Previously, only the police department and the Department of Environmental Protection had this authority. Civilians are also allowed to report violations under the new law. In 2017, the City of Palo Alto began considering a proposal to stop drivers from running engines when parked. Truckers argue for the need for idling to keep their cabins comfortable overnight at truck stops. Further complaints have come from the lack of concurrence among state and local idling laws. This disparity in laws requires truckers travelling across the country to be aware of the local idling laws in every place they visit. Even consistency between state and local laws has been a concern. Some truckers have expressed concern that some idling laws could prevent them from complying with other laws, For example, laws requiring truckers to get a certain amount of uninterrupted rest might be interfered with by anti-idling laws. The transportation blog uShip.com, Ship Happens states that ‚Äú[anti-idling] laws fail to consider the truckers well-being and place drivers at risk of debilitating fines for noncompliance.‚Äù These fines could run as high as $25,000 in Connecticut for idling for more than three minutes.http://blog.uship.com/us/2008/12/negative- consequences-of-anti-idling-legislation.html United Kingdom Unnecessary vehicle idling is an offence against the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) (England) Regulations (Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 1808).http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1808/contents/made It is unclear whether Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have similar regulations. The regulations apply in zones designated as Air quality management areas by local authorities. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has published a list of local authorities with air quality management areas.http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/aqma/list Europe In Europe, vehicles increasingly include a Start-stop system to prevent idling. Hong Kong Hong Kong introduced an anti-idling bill in 2010.http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr09-10/english/bc/bc06/minutes/bc0620100601.pdf Technologies Fuel-operated coolant heaters There are a variety of reasons that bus drivers idle their engines. The majority of engine idling occurs in the morning, when drivers are warming up the engines and the passenger compartments. Part of the problem with excessive idling, other than the immense amount of fuel it uses, is driver mentality coming from lack of knowledge about the fuel consumption of an idling engine. Typically, a bus driver will turn on the bus when they wake up, then proceed to get ready for the day, creating a period of excessive idling of up to half an hour. The objective of fuel-operated heaters is to eliminate this specific need for idling, which in turn reduces fuel consumption and costs. This technology works by using the coolant system to warm the engine, and the ‚Äúthermal energy gained is then distributed through the vehicle's own heat exchanger as forced hot air. This [process] heats the interior of the vehicle via existing air vents. The engine is [also] warmed up with the residual heat in the cooling water‚Äù.http://www.espar.com/html/products/coolantheaters.html In general, coolant heaters burns eight times less fuel that an idling engine would, simultaneously emitting 1/20th of the emissions and directing heat significantly faster to the passenger compartment. Coolant heaters are also much more efficient than an engine. For example, according to the manufacturer, the Webasto TSL-17 is upwards of 82% efficient, whereas a diesel engine has no more than half that efficiency.http://www.techwebasto.com/heater_main/5000838A.pdf Auxiliary power units Auxiliary power units (APUs) are commonly used on semi-trucks to provide electric power to the cabin at times when the cabin or cargo need to be heated or cooled while the vehicle is not in motion for an extended period of time. This period of time is usually overnight, when the truck driver has parked at a truck stop for some rest. Instead of having to keep the engine idling all night just to maintain the temperature in the cabin, the APU can turn on and provide power. Most commonly, the APU will have its own cooling system, heating system, generator, and air conditioning compressor. Sometimes the APU will be integrated into those components of the semi itself. APUs are also commonly used in police cruisers as an alternative to idling. Since a significant amount of time is spent in the cruiser while stationary, idling becomes a major source of cost to police fleets, though, most police fleets have idling policies. The drawback of APUs on police cruisers is that they are normally kept in the trunk where they take up valuable space. Truck stop electrification Federal safety regulations developed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, require that truckers must rest ten hours for every eleven hours of consecutive driving. As a result, drivers spend extended periods of time resting and sleeping inside the cabs of their trucks. To maintain comfort and amenities, most long haul truck drivers idle their engines for close to ten hours per day to power their heating systems and air conditioners, generate electricity for on-board appliances, charge their vehicle's batteries, and to warm their engines in colder weather. Given that trucks typically consume 0.8 gallons (3.03 L) of diesel fuel per hour of idling, between 900 and 1,400 gallons (3406 to 5300 L) of fuel are consumed each year per truck, resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Truck- stop electrification (TSE) and auxiliary power unit technologies provide long- haul truckers with the ability to heat, cool, and power additional auxiliary devices at truck stops without requiring them to idle their engines. The United States Department of Transportation estimates there are approximately 5,000 truck stops on the U.S. highway system that provide overnight parking, restrooms, showers, stores, restaurants and fueling stations. The United States Department of Energy maintains a website that lists current TSE sites throughout the United States. As of October 2013, the website records 115 TSE stations throughout the country. Truck stop electrification allows a trucker to ‚Äúplug-in‚Äù to power their on and off-board electrical needs. There are two types of truck stop electrification, on-board and off-board systems. On board TSE solutions allow trucker's the ability to recharge their batteries at truck stops via standard 120 Volt electrical outlets. Truckers can then utilize the truck's batteries to power appliances and provide heating and cooling to the truck cab. Typically, on-board TSE solutions require some vehicle modification. Off-board TSE solutions do not typically require any vehicle modifications, as they provide heating and air conditioning services via an overhead unit and hose that connects to the truck's window. In addition to heating and cooling, these connections can also offer standard electrical outlets, internet access, movies and satellite programming. Normally, private companies provide and regulate either system and can charge an hourly rate for services, typically around $1.00-$2.00 an hour. Both of these options can generate revenue for truck stop operators, and decrease operating expenses for truckers relative to the cost of diesel fuel. The cost of electricity to provide overnight power to trucks can save up to $3,240 of fuel that would normally be consumed by idling per parking space. Truck stop electrification can allow truck drivers to abide local idling regulations and reduce noise to neighboring establishments. The cost of implementing a single TSE site can vary greatly, depending on the type of technology that is employed. Installation costs for technology that provides external power to operate equipment on board a truck range from $4,500 to $8,500 per space, whereas the costs to provide a window based power unit (i.e. an off board apparatus) range from $10,000 to $20,000 per space. Costs for an individual truck operator to install an on-board system capable of utilizing shore power from a TSE space can cost up to $2,000.  Idle management/control  Idle management technologies have been developed as an upfitting solution to answer idling concerns. Similar to a start-stop system, idle management technologies can control the vehicle while in Park are Neutral, which allows for extensive control when the vehicle is in its primary state of issue‚Äîat idle. Some idle management technologies are so comprehensive, they are able to manage the engine's on/off ignition while retaining control of auxiliary functions, such as vehicle climate, anti-theft, operator security, and more, even when the engine is powered off. A great example of the most robust and complex idle management system is the GRIP Idle Management System.

Early life and education A native of North Philadelphia, Clarke grew up in the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood. He graduated from Edison High School. He later attended the Community College of Philadelphia but did not graduate. Political career He was elected as a committeeman himself and became an aide to John Street, who represented the Fifth District for nearly three decades and eventually became Council President. Election to city council In December 1998, Street resigned as a member of the City Council to run for mayor and endorsed Clarke for his seat in the 1999 special election held. Clarke won by only 140 votes over Julie Welker and Dorothy Carn. Welker filed a lawsuit alleging election fraud. The case was decided in Clarke‚Äôs favor. City council tenure Clarke is a former Majority Whip and is the Chair of the Fiscal Stability and Public Property Committees and Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He was elected to the position of Council President after the office was vacated by the retiring Anna Verna. One of Clarke's legislative actions was his introduction of the bill to end the City-subsidized lease on the 80-year-old headquarters building of the Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America over their ban on gay scouts. After a protracted legal battle, the bill was overturned in Federal court and the City of Philadelphia was ordered to pay nearly a million dollars in legal fees to the Boy Scouts.

The title song is a parody of English rock band Queen's 1980 single \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\". The EP also features three other songs, all of which are original recordings. All four songs on Another One Rides the Bus later appeared on Yankovic's eponymous debut studio album; the three original songs were re- recorded for the album, while the title song is the same version that appears on the EP. Another One Rides the Bus EPof which only one thousand copies were madewas released to capitalize on the recent success of the titular parody. Yankovic borrowed money from Barret \\"Dr. Demento\\" Hansen to pay for the record, and distributed them to records stores under consignment deals. Due to the underground success of this record, TK Records signed Yankovic and released \\"Another One Rides the Bus\\" as a single. Recording The EP features the titular parody, as well as three original comedy songs, with music written by Yankovic. In April 1980, Yankovic recorded the first song for the album, \\"Gotta Boogie\\". The song, co-written by Joe Earley, is a play on words discussing a man with a \\"boogie\\" on his finger and his quandary therein. The second song to be recorded for the EP was \\"Another One Rides the Bus\\", on September 14, 1980. Yankovic wrote the song, a parody of Queen's hit \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", and debuted it live on the Dr. Demento Show, hosted by Barret \\"Dr. Demento\\" Hansen. While practicing the song outside the sound booth, Yankovic met Jon \\"Bermuda\\" Schwartz who told Yankovic he was a drummer. Schwartz agreed to drum on Yankovic's accordion case to keep a steady beat to the song.Rabin and Yankovic, p. 28. \\"Another One Rides the Bus\\" became so popular that it landed Yankovic a short-lived record deal with TK Records, and also led to his first appearance on a TV show, The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder. On the show, Yankovic played his accordion and Schwartz banged on Yankovic's accordion case and played the bulb horns.Rabin and Yankovic, p. 30. In January 1981, the song \\"Mr. Frump in the Iron Long\\" was recorded. The song, an audience favorite from Yankovic's days playing in coffeehouses at Cal Poly, describes the rather lopsided relationship between the narrator and the eponymous \\"Mr. Frump\\" in his iron lung, until the latter's death. The final song, recorded on January 19, 1981, was \\"Happy Birthday\\". A morbidly depressing birthday song detailing ails of the world, including poverty, nuclear holocaust, and eventual solar cataclysm, the song is based on the music of artist Tonio K. Only seeing two popular birthday songs at the time--\\"Happy Birthday to You\\" by Patty and Mildred J. Hill, and \\"Birthday\\" by The Beatles--Yankovic decided to write his own \\"severely twisted version of one\\". \\"Happy Birthday' was recorded in the garage of Richard Bennett, the brother of Schwartz who would go on to be a noted guitarist and record producer. All of the tracks, sans \\"Another One Rides the Bus\\" were recorded on a 4-track Portastudio; because only four tracks were available for mixing and recording, Yankovic had to carefully plan which parts of the songs he wanted to record at a time, and then mix them down before adding more song elements.Rabin and Yankovic, p. 34. The EP's version of \\"Happy Birthday\\" is included on the Permanent Record: Al in the Box box set, and was remixed into stereo for the Hurricane Katrina charity album Laughter Is a Powerful Weapon Volume II. \\"Gotta Boogie\\", \\"Happy Birthday\\", and \\"Mr. Frump in the Iron Long\\" would be re-recorded for Yankovic's eponymous debut studio album, while \\"Another One Rides the Bus\\" would not. Release Yankovic borrowed money from Dr. Demento to press up one thousand copies of this EP. Yankovic desired to release the song on a record label, although no label wanted to sign him at the time. Thus, Yankovic borrowed some money from Dr. Demento and pressed up one thousand copies of the four-track EP by himself.Rabin and Yankovic, p. 33. Yankovic then distributed the EP to various record stores, selling them through consignment deals.Rabin and Yankovic, p. 31. Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records, a one-off label founded by Yankovic for the sole purpose of distributing the EPs. Due to the underground success of the record, Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short-lived record deal with TK Records, who released the title song as a single. Due to the fact that only one thousand copies of the Another One Rides the Bus EP were made, today it is considered a very rare record to locate.

The best-known type is the commutator, which is an integral part of a DC dynamo, but before solid-state devices became available, independent mechanical rectifiers were used for certain applications. Before the invention of semiconductors, rectification at high currents involved serious losses. There were various vacuum/gas devices, such as the mercury arc rectifiers, thyratrons, ignitrons, and vacuum diodes. Solid-state technology was in its infancy, represented by copper oxide and selenium rectifiers. All of these gave excessive forward voltage drop at high currents. One answer was mechanically opening and closing contacts, if this could be done quickly and cleanly enough. Vibrator type This was the reverse of a vibrator inverter. An electromagnet, powered by DC through contacts it operated (like a buzzer) (or fed with AC), caused a spring to vibrate and the spring operated change-over contacts which converted the AC to DC. This arrangement was only suitable for low-power applications, e.g. auto radios and was also found in some motorcycle electrical systems, where it was combined with a voltage regulator. Motor-driven type This operated on the same principle as the vibrator type but the change-over contacts were operated by a synchronous motor. It was suitable for high-power applications, e.g. electrolysis cells and electrostatic precipitators. Still rectifier A mechanical rectifier was patented in 1895 (US patent 547043)http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&NR;=547043A&KC;=A&FT;=D&ND;=3&date;=18951001&DB;=EPODOC&locale;=en_EP by William Joseph Still. The details are obscure but it appears from the diagram to be similar to a third-brush dynamo. BTH rectifier The machine shown in the reference was designed by Read and Gimson et al., at British Thomson-Houston (BTH) Rugby, Warwickshire, England, in the early 1950s. It is a three-phase mechanical rectifier working at 220 volts and 15,000 amperes, and its application was the powering of huge banks of electrolysis cells. The central shaft was rotated by synchronous motor, driving an eccentric with a throw of about 2mm. (0.077 inch) Push-rods from this operated the contacts. The timing was critical, and was adjusted by rotating the position of the eccentric on its shaft, and by sliding wedges between the eccentric and push- rods. Crucial to this system were the commutating reactors, inductors that ensured the contacts closed when the voltage across them was small, and opened when the current was small. Without these, contact wear would have been intolerably heavy. These were series inductors that operated for most of the cycle with saturated cores. When the current decreased below that for saturation, their inductances reduced the current considerably. Contact switching was timed to occur while their cores were un-saturated. In the USA, similar rectifiers were made by the I-T-E circuit breaker company. This machinery was undoubtedly successful; its efficiency was determined to be 97.25%. Contact life was never fully determined but considerably exceeded 2000 hours. However, the rapid development of the silicon diode made it ultimately redundant.

It was founded in 1346, as the church of the Servite Community of the Blessed Virgin Mary and was designed by Andrea da Faenza, a head friar and architect who also assisted Antonio di Vincenzo on the monumental Basilica of San Petronio. In the 20th century, Pope Pius XII granted the church the status of \\"basilica\\". Architecture Interior The basilica is 100 metres long by 20 metres wide. It has the form of a Latin cross but the transepts do not project beyond the aisles. The shallow apse is five segments of an octagon, as is common in Italian Gothic churches. It was designed in the Gothic style with pointed arches throughout. At the death of Padre Andrea in 1396, the work was not complete. However, the completion in the 15th century saw little change to the design of the basilica itself, which is entirely Gothic in appearance. The central nave and side aisles are divided from each other by stout round columns with floriate capitals, the shafts being red in colour and the capitals and bases of contrasting pale stone, adding a decorative effect to the very simple architecture. The plastered walls above the arcade are pierced by ocular windows set high under the gothic vault. The vault is of a simple quadrupartite form with the brick ribs in contrast to the infilling. Exterior Externally, the church is very plain, undecorated brick. The facade, which was constructed in several phases, has never been decorated. A remarkable feature of the church is its courtyard or atrium. This is a feature that was common in Early Christian churches, including the earlier St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, but has almost always disappeared. This is an unusual case of an atrium being built in the 16th century. It appears to have been modelled on the arcade built by Brunelleschi at the Hospital of the Innocents (Ospedale degli Innocenti) in Florence, and later extended to other parts of the large piazza, including the front of the Church of the Assumption. In the case of Santa Maria dei Servi, the piazza in front of the basilica was quite small‚Äîwhich permitted building a wide arcade around it that encloses the entire square without interruption. The arcade is closed on one side by the conventual buildings, but on two sides it is open to the street, and extends along the entire left side of the building. Where the arcade meets the facade, it forms a \\"narthex\\" or wide portico of five arches, stretching across the front of the church. The arcade has a decorative cornice and circular moulding on the spandrels echoes the occular window in the facade. Artworks The many works of art still housed in the church include a Holy Virgin Enthroned traditionally attributed to Cimabue but thought to be a product of his workshop, remains of 14th-century frescoes by Vitale da Bologna and Lippo di Dalmasio, paintings by Innocenzo da Imola and Francesco Albani, and a marble altarpiece of the Annunciation of Mary (1558) by Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, a pupil of Michelangelo. The church also possesses a widely praised pipe organ, made in 1967 by the Tamburini company of Crema, which can be operated with a mechanical action.

She became a researcher at the US Department of Agriculture. There she investigated bacteriology in milk and cheese. She later demonstrated that Bacillus abortus caused the disease Brucellosis (undulant fever or Malta fever) in both cattle and humans. Early life and education Alice C. Evans, in graduation dress Evans was born on a farm in Neath, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, to William Howell, a farmer, and surveyor, and Anne B. Evans, a teacher. When Evans was five and six years old, she was taught at home by her parents and attended a one-room school house in Neath where she earned outstanding grades. In 1886, Evans survived scarlet fever, as did her brother Morgan. She attended the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute in Towanda, where she played on a women's basketball team and later became a teacher. In her memoirs, she writes that she became a teacher because it was the only profession open to women, but she found it boring. After four years of teaching, she took free classes that were offered to rural teachers at Cornell University.\\"Alice Evans\\" Education & Resources. National Women's History Museum, December 15, 2005. Web. After receiving a scholarship, she earned a B.S. in bacteriology from Cornell University in 1909, and was the first woman to receive a bacteriology scholarship from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where she earned her M.S. the following year. Work and discoveries Evans was offered a federal position at the Dairy Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry at the United States Department of Agriculture. She accepted the offer in Madison, Wisconsin, and worked there for three years. She worked on refining the process of manufacturing cheese and butter for improved flavor and investigating the sources of bacterial contamination in milk products. She was the first woman scientist to hold a permanent position as a USDA bacteriologist and as a civil servant was protected by law. Alice became interested in the disease brucellosis and its relationship to fresh, unpasteurized milk. Alice's investigation focused on the organism Bacillus abortus, known to cause miscarriages in animals. Alice learned that the microbe thrived in infected cows as well as animals that appeared healthy. The reports hypothesized that since the bacteria was found in cow's milk, a threat to human health was likely. Evans decided to investigate this; she wondered whether the disease in cows could be the cause of undulant fever in humans. She reported her findings to the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1917 and published her work in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in 1918. She was met with skepticism, particularly because she was a woman and did not have a Ph.D. She warned that raw milk should be pasteurized to protect people from various diseases. During the 1920s, scientists around the world made the same findings, and eventually, Brucella was confirmed as the disease that caused what was then known as undulant fever and Malta fever. Her findings led to the pasteurization of milk in 1930. As a result, the incidence of brucellosis in the United States was significantly reduced. Evans joined the United States Public Health Service in 1918, where she contributed to the field of infectious illness, studying epidemic meningitis and influenza at the department's Hygienic Laboratories. There, she was infected with undulant fever in 1922, a then-incurable disease that impaired her health for twenty years. Alice C. Evans, 1945 Evans donated a collection of her papers to the National Library of Medicine in 1969.  Post-retirement and death  Evans officially retired in 1945 but continued working in the field.

Characteristics The Tori comes mainly in the colors black, bay, palomino, chestnut and liver chestnut. Today's Tori is a harness horse that has a clean and solid build. It has a large to medium-sized head, a shortened poll, a neck that is medium in length and fleshy, withers that are average in height, a back that is long and flat, a loin that is broad as well as a croup that is broad, and the horse is well muscled. The Tori has a very broad and deep chest, and limbs that are clean and properly set. Tori stallions at the studs are usually 162 cm high at the withers. This breed has a high fertility ratio, with 86 foals per 100 mares. History The sport horse type, which is lighter in build. From 1890 to 1950, this breed was developed in Estonia at the stud in Tori, P√§rnumaa. It was developed by crossing native Estonian mares with European crossbred stallions. This breed was mainly founded by a stallion named Hetman, whose sire was Stewart, a crossbreed of a Norfolk Trotter and an Anglo-Norman mare. The Tori breed was formed by breeding Hetman and his sons. Thus, a valuable breeding nucleus rapidly formed, that slowed as signs of inbreeding depression were found in the 1930s. This deteriorated performance and robustness. To eliminate this inbreeding depression, Toris were crossed with Breton Post- horse stallions, and as a result, the massive type of Tori became widespread while the quality of the gaits declined. The need for a combination of utility and sporting qualities in horse led to crossings with Hanoverian, Holstein and Trakehner stallions. Recent horse breeders have been trying mainly to get a very light sport horse-type of horse, resulting in a rapid loss of purebred Tori. Mihkel Ilmj√§rv, who worked as the head of the Tori Horse Farm in 1926‚Äì1947, and Arved Toots, who was founder and head of the Aravete Tori Horse Farm in 1955‚Äì1992, have great merits in breeding the Tori horse breed. In 1990, there were 55 farms in Estonia where Tori horses were bred, 15 of these were first class breeding farms.Meie hobune.

Playing career J√≥hannes started his career with Valur in his native land before short spells with Metz of France and Holbek of Denmark. He moved to Scotland in 1975, joining Celtic F.C. after a short trial. He played in almost every outfield position while at Celtic but was most suited to central defence. He was nicknamed \\"Shuggy\\" by the fans. After making 188 appearances for the Glasgow club, during which he scored 36 goals, Johannes won 2 Premier Division titles and 1 Scottish Cup before he moved to the US in February 1980, joining NASL side Tulsa Roughnecks. J√≥hannes returned to Europe in 1981, joining German side Hannover 96. He later joined Motherwell in 1982 and played two seasons for the Fir Park side before retiring in 1984. During his career he gained 34 caps for the Iceland national side, 16 of which were attained while with Celtic. Coaching career J√≥hannes started a coaching career with √ûr√≥ttur in 1984 but soon returned to live in Scotland, where his wife is from. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in 1995 but made a full recovery. J√≥hannes is now a coach for a 1994 team Jimmy Johnstone Academy. Family footballing connections J√≥hannes' father Evald Mikson was a former Estonian international goalkeeper in the 1930s, who was later Deputy Head of the Tallinn Police during the Nazi occupation. Accused of war crimes, Mikson fled Estonia at the end of World War II, eventually alighting in Iceland where he settled and raised a family, changing his name to the Icelandic E√∞vald Hinriksson. J√≥hannes' brother Atli, seven years his junior, was also an international footballer. Atli was for a period Iceland's record cap holder, and played most of his career in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Uerdingen and Fortuna D√ºsseldorf before moving into coaching. He managed the Icelandic national side between 2000 and 2003.

Knox trained as an architect at Edinburgh College of Art (1963‚Äì67) and Heriot-Watt University (1967-68), and worked as an architect before establishing himself as a cartoonist. He worked in animation from 1970 to 1975 for Halas & Batchelor in London, Potterton Productions in Montreal, and Kotopoulis Productions in Toronto. He then joined Red Weekly and Socialist Challenge as a political cartoonist, as well as contributing to various children's comics for IPC from 1975-88. He signed much of his political work \\"Blotski\\", and he and Republican News cartoonist Cormac worked together as \\"Kormski\\", drawing the anti-clerical strip \\"Dog Collars\\" for Fortnight Magazine. Since 1989 he has been the editorial cartoonist for The Irish News, a nationalist newspaper based in Belfast. Since 1996 he has contributed the \\"As I See It\\" feature to Hearts and Minds on BBC2 Northern Ireland. From 1997-98 he was political cartoonist for Ireland on Sunday. Knox has cited Ronald Searle, Low, John Glashan, Vicky, Steve Bell, Pat Oliphant and Charles Addams among those who have influenced him.

Many songs reference Swedish TV and radio personalities. Onkel K√•nkel is often considered to have created the k√∂nsrock genre. While well known for their shock value, Onkel K√•nkel's music has never entered the mainstream, though the band managed to get the 46th placement on the Swedish top-50 chart in 1994. One of their albums, Kalle Anka Suger Pung (), briefly had some radio airplay, but was pulled off the air due to perceived inappropriate content. More recently, the Internet has spread Onkel K√•nkel to a younger generation. Onkel K√•nkel has been compared to Eddie Meduza and Johnny Bode. H√•kan Flor√•, Onkel K√•nkel's frontman and singer/guitarist, wore a mask while performing, so as to \\"not take away the mystery\\". H√•kan Flor√• died of a heart attack aged 47 on the 15th of August 2009. Controversies In 1995 Inge Carlsson, a social democratic party member of parliament, sent a written inquiry to then current Minister of Justice Laila Freivalds, requesting a ban on \\"offensive musical lyrics\\", after having been contacted by a school teacher upset by Onkel K√•nkel's songs. The minister denied the request on grounds of freedom of speech, adding that such lyrics are \\"repulsive and sad\\", but not illegal. At the 1993 Hultsfred festival, during the first of the few live shows the band performed, an intellectually disabled man not part of the band was invited on stage, singing along to choruses and telling jokes between songs. This caused controversy, as some people considered it to be making fun of people with disabilities. When interviewed about the accusations, Onkel K√•nkel answered \\"That is bullshit. The concert was among the most fun things he has ever experienced. He is a really fun guy. It is not wrong to laugh at disabled people, what's wrong is to ignore them, to treat them as if they did not exist.\\" Members The number of band members and their degree of involvement has never been firmly established. Only H√•kan Flor√• has had his identity as the band's frontman revealed to the general public, after his death. While some have speculated that he was the only member, he stated in interviews that there were other members. These are the officially credited members: *Onkel K√•nkel - Vocals, Guitar *Epilepsi Kurt - Drums, Percussion *Arne Tammer - Special Effects, Vocals *CP Sven - Bass, Vocals *Stomi Bertil - Guitar, Vocals  Discography  *Svenska Ton√•rsgrupper Vol 3 (1981 12\\" LP, Konkurens Rek√•rdz) The first appearance of Onkel K√•nkel on vinyl, with the song \\"Nazzepenis i F√ºhrerns anus\\".

Erie is well connected to the Interstate Highway System. Six highway exits from Interstste 90 (I-90) connect travelers to Erie from Boston, Massachusetts and points east, and from Cleveland, Ohio and points west. Those traveling north to Erie on I-79 can either merge with I-90 or continue north for several local Erie exits before the road merges into the Bayfront Parkway in downtown Erie. Southbound travelers of I-79 can connect with I-80 for points east to New Jersey or west to Akron, Ohio or Youngstown, Ohio, or continue south on Interstate 79 to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Charleston, West Virginia. I-86, also called the \\"Southern Tier Expressway,\\" splits from I-90 at North East, Pennsylvania and heads southeast through New York State to Binghamton. The city has a number of important arterial roads. Pennsylvania Route 5 (12th Street), U.S. Route 20 (26th Street and Buffalo Road), and 38th Street are major east-west routes through Erie's municipal roadway grid.

The fountain is a model example of Mannerist taste of the Italian courtly elite in the mid-sixteenth century. History The construction of the fountain was commissioned by the Cardinal Legate Charles Borromeo, to symbolize the fortunate recent election of Borromeo's uncle as Pope Pius IV. To clear space for the fountain, an entire edifice had to be demolished. The design and assembly of the fountain was completed by the Palermitan architect Tommaso Laureti in 1563. The fountain was completed in 1565.Documents in the State Archives in Bologna were used by W. Gramberg, Giambologna, eine Untersuchung √ºber seine Wanderj√§hre (Berlin) 1936.

Detail with a lactating nereid. Description Neptune Fountain has its base on three steps, on which it is situated a tank made of the local boulder and covered by marble of Verona. In the centre of the tank, there is a base where there are four Nereids who holding their breasts, from which jets of water emerge. The base is decorated with pontifical emblems, ornaments that ‚Äì connected to four cherubs ‚Äì hold dolphins (which are allegorical representation of major rivers from the then- known corners of the world: the Ganges, the Nile, the Amazon River, and the Danube. In the centre of this base raises the majestic figure of the Neptune sculpted by Giambologna's; the statue is a typical expressions of the manneristic theatricality. The Neptune stretches his left hand in a lordly gesture, appearing to be aiming to placate the waves; this posture is interpreted as symbolic exaltation of the new power of the Pope Pius IV: just as Neptune was the master of the seas, the Pope was the master of Bologna and of the world. Inscriptions On the four sides of the marble tank there are four inscriptions in Latin provide the background to the fountain's construction: #Fori Ornamento (to decorate the square); #Aere Publico (built thanks to public money); #Populi Commodo (built for the people); #MDLXIIII (built in 1564; the date is wrong though, since the fountain was officially finished in 1566). The four main sources of political power for Bologna then are also inscribed on the base: #Pius IIII Pont. Max (Pope Pius IV) #Petrus Donatus Caesius Gubernator; #Carolus Borromaeus Cardinalis; (Cardinal Carlo Borromeo) #S.P.Q.B.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 2,140. Geography Misterton is located in the far north-east of both Bassetlaw and Nottinghamshire between Walkeringham to the south and Haxey (in North Lincolnshire) to the north. The east of the village is bordered by the River Trent and the west by farmland. The village is situated six miles (10 km) north-west of Gainsborough, on the busy A161 which runs between Beckingham and Goole. The Doncaster to Lincoln Line runs north-south to the east of the village. Currently there is no station on the line between Gainsborough and Doncaster. The village is the last along the A161 road (going north), before Lincolnshire ‚Äì the Isle of Axholme. The B1403 meets the main road here, which is for Gringley-on-the-Hill. The A161 is the main road through to the Isle of Axholme, entering it when half a mile (1 km) north of crossing the River Idle at Haxey Gate Bridge next to the Haxey Gate Inn. The river meets the Trent in the parish. The Trent Valley Way and Cuckoo Way, which follow the Chesterfield Canal at this point, cross the Trent at West Stockwith. The parish boundary follows the River Idle (through Misterton Soss) and railway line to the north-east, then continues along the county boundary (again by the River Idle), and to the west follows the Gringley and Misterton Boundary Drain. It crosses Fountain Hill before following Fox Covert Lane, near the primary school, to meet the Trent. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 1,223. Subsidiary villages The Misterton Ward of Bassetlaw District Council contains the villages of West Stockwith and Misterton, but exclude Stockwith Road (or Newells Terrace), Bramley Way and Pippin Close, which fall within the Walkeringham parish. Governance Prior to 1935 Misterton was the centre of the Misterton Rural District, which was absorbed by the East Retford Rural District. This in turn was absorbed by Bassetlaw in 1974. Toponomy The place-name Misterton seems to contain the Old English word mynster, a monastery, the church of a monastery or religious body, a church served by secular clergy, + t≈´n (Old English) meaning an enclosure, a farmstead, a village, an estate, etc, so possibly 'Monastery farm/settlement'.J.

Ekwall, Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names (Oxford, 1960), p.328 Misterton appears in the Domesday survey of 1086 as Ministretone.National Archives: E 31/2/2/3826. Amenities The village primary school is located in Grove Wood Road on the former secondary school site. The former primary school buildings in High Street now house the Youth and Community Centre. There is a library next to the Youth and Community Centre and a Co-op on the other side of High Street. There is a fire station to the south of the village, just inside the parish of Walkeringham. The village contains two pubs, the Red Hart and the Haxey Gate Inn. There were at one time also the Windmill (demolished 1974) in High Street, the Packet Inn (closed in 2002 and subsequently demolished, Closed Pubs in Nottinghamshire.) next to the canal and lower lock, and Misterton Sports Social Club (closed in 2016). The parish church is dedicated to All Saints, a Grade I listed building. It belongs to the Church of England diocese of Southwell and Nottingham. The east window of the Holy Cross chapel was designed by John Piper and made by his glassmaker, Patrick Reyntiens. Sports clubs Misterton United football club has been a village club run by the local community for many years. The club now ranges from junior level through to senior level also with a girls team. It plays in the Gainsborough district league and the Doncaster junior league. Misterton Bowls Club plays in the Gainsborough League, the Isle of Axholme League and the Pensioners League.

He was a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War and was the 43rd and last Colonial Mayor of New York City from 1776 until 1783. As New York City was the center of British control of the Colonies during the war, he was one of the highest ranking civilian authorities in the Colonies during this period. He was accused of supporting a plan led by Thomas Hickey to kill the Revolutionary General George Washington. He resettled in Nova Scotia after the war, and became a leading political figure in the Cape Breton colony that was created in 1786. Early life and education Mathews was born in New York to Vincent Mathews and Catalina Abeel, the daughter of Johannes Abeel, the second Mayor of Albany and Catherine Schuyler. He earned a Master of Arts degree from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1754. He was admitted to practice law in Orange County, New York in 1760, and was the County Clerk of Orange County from 1762 through 1778.Chester, Alden and Williams, Edwin Melvin.

Mathews and William Tryon, the governor of the Province of New York, were also accused of being involved, as was a member of Washington's Life Guard, Thomas Hickey, who would eventually be executed for his role. After John Jay interviewed many witnesses regarding the payments made by the British to recruits, he as head of the Committee of Conspiracies of the New York Provincial Congress, and after consultation and approval by Washington, ordered Mathews' arrest for \\"being engaged in a Conspiracy against the Authority of the Congress and the Liberties of America.\\" Mathews was arrested at his Flatbush home on June 22, 1776 by Lieutenant Colonel Ezekiel Cornell. On July 8, the New York Provincial Congress, after Mathews was found guilty of treason and subversion, was sentenced to death and was to be executed on August 25. He was first sent to Hartford, Connecticut under the care of Abraham DePeyser, and then sent to Litchfield, Connecticut on July 21 and placed under house arrest in the home of Major Moses Seymour, whose orders were as follows: > you are directed and required to take him under your Care and him safely > convey from Hartford in Hartford county to Litchfield ___ aforesaid and him > there hold and keep in safe Custody permitting him only to walk abroad for > the Benefit of the Air in the Day Time and to attend Divine Service at some > place of public worship and that under your law or that of some other trusty > keeper on the Sabbath Day, until you secure further Orders from me or from > the Provincial Convention of the State of New York.Litchfield Historical > Society, Woodruff Collection, Governor Jonathan Trumbull to Major Moses > Seymour, August 22, 1776 Mathews, in a letter to a college classmate written during his imprisonment, denied his involvement in the plot against Washington: > I have made so many fruitless applications lately that I am almost > discouraged putting pen to paper again.

On November 27, Major Seymour placed the following notice in the Connecticut Journal seeking help in recapturing Matthews for the reward of $50 (about $3,000 ). The notice read as follows: New York under British control Mathews subsequently resumed his office as mayor in late 1776, returning on December 2, during which time New York was firmly in British control. His house was located on Water Street. General Howe, in late 1776, awarded Mathews all of the profits from the city's ferries, markets and slips, for his own personal use. Previously these funds were reverted to the corporation of the City of New York Jones, Thomas.

Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War 2010 and was often referred to as Colonel. In 1778, a party of twenty men \\"with their faces blacked and otherwise disguised\\" led by Captain John Schenck went to Flatbush as part of the Whaleboat War in a failed attempt to capture Mathews. They instead took away Major James Moncrief.Chopra, Ruma. Unnatural Rebellion\\" Loyalists in New York City During the Revolution . Charlottesville, VA 2011, page 163. In August 1778 Mathews sustained injuries in assisting British military and Manhattan residents in extinguishing a fire on what is now Front Street along the East River. In June 1779 an attempt by Loyalists to kidnap New Jersey Governor William Livingston, a distant Schuyler cousin of Mathews, failed. Mathews was suspected to have organized this plot.McBurney page 74 The New York Assembly, on October 22, 1779, in an Act of Attainder, declared Mathews to be one of 59 state felons who was to be executed if found in the state. His property, which totaled nearly 27,000 acres, was confiscated. In his father Vincent Mathews' will, he was not mentioned and only his children were listed as inheritors. It is likely that Mathews was at least complicit in the handling of colonial military prisoners, who were not considered Prisoners of War until months after the British defeat at the Battle of Yorktown. Over 10,000 colonial soldiers died as prisoners during the American Revolutionary War, most of them in New York and on prison ships in the East River, more than the men who died in combat. Mathews is on record as a visitor to colonial prisoners and in fact helped to produce affidavits denying allegations of abuse and neglect from half a dozen British officials swearing that American prisoners were fed and comfortable.Burrows, Edwin G. Forgotten Patriots: The Untold Story of American Prisoners During the Revolutionary War Basic Books 2008 Mathews' character was considered questionable not just by Patriots but by fellow Loyalists as well. Former Chief Justice of the Province of New York and fellow Loyalist William Smith wrote that Mathews \\"sends out Parties to the Country to plunder & he has a Share of it,\\" even alleging that he had clearly lied about magnanimously sending stolen goods on the Poor House. Smith then contemplated that \\"If these Charges are true this Man must dread the restoration of the Peace of his Country & the Re Establishment of order.\\" Thomas Jones described Mathews as \\"a person low in estimation as a lawyer, profligate, abandoned, and dissipated, indigent, extravagant, and voluptuous as himself.\\"O'Reilly, Edward. \\"Profligate, abandoned, and dissipated\\": New York City's Last Colonial Mayor From the Stacks: New York Historical Society June 10, 2015. http://blog.nyhistory.org/profligate-abandoned-and-dissipated- new-york-citys-last-colonial-mayor/ Accessed August 11, 2015. Peter Dubois, fellow magistrate of Mathews, spoke of him as a \\"profligate and villain\\" who took advantage of his status and position by taking possession of stolen household goods and even goods that were destined for people in poorhouses.Chopra pages 153-154 Departure to Nova Scotia On or around Evacuation Day, Mathews left with other Loyalists to Nova Scotia, having had his two houses and 26,000 acres of land seized by the colonists. Failing to gain an appointment as that province's attorney general, he traveled to Cape Breton Island, which in 1786 was administered as a separate colony. There he was appointed attorney general and a member of the Executive Council by Lieutenant Governor Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres. Although an elected house of assembly was to have been established, this did not occur, and Mathews became a leading and divisive figure in the small colony's politics. He had a difficult relationship with both DesBarres and his successor, William Macarmick, who eventually left the colony in 1795, leaving Mathews, as senior counselor, as interim administrator of the colony. Mathews then packed its government with friends and business associates. When he was succeeded as administrator by John Murray, the latter dismissed him from the post of attorney general. Mathews made common cause with the Duke of Kent, who had a personal dislike of Murray, and engineered Murray's replacement. While living in Nova Scotia the Mi'kmaq native peoples would periodically use his home to live in during leaner times; discouraging or rebuffing these requests ran the risk of inciting conflict.  Death  Mathews died on July 28, 1800, and was buried in Sydney.Mclachlan, James. Princetonians, 1748-1768: A Biographical Dictionary. Princeton University Press, Mar 8, 2015, page 108  Personal life  Mathews married Sarah Seymour on November 6, 1758, in Trinity Church (Manhattan)}Trinity Church in New York. Some of Mathews' nine children remained in Canada. Others, such as his daughter Harriet Mathews, whose daughter Anna Winslow Green married Harvard University president Samuel Webber, married Americans and moved to the United States. His eldest daughter, Catalina, married a lieutenant in the 35th (Royal Sussex) Regiment of Foot and subsequently moved to Rye, East Sussex England, where she bore children. Mathews' granddaughter married Vice Admiral James Noble, who served on with Lord Nelson. Catalina Mathews' descendants include solicitor and editor Horace Pym and British historian Keith Kissack and can be found in England, Canada, United States, Australia and New Zealand. Descendants of Mathews have served in both Canadian and United States politics and government in both local and national capacities. In Canada Murray Dodd, represented Cape Breton in the House of Commons of Canada from 1882 to 1887 and was named Queen's Counsel in 1880. Also Lewis Wilkieson Johnstone (1862-1936), who was also a grandson of Edmund Murray Dodd, was a Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada representing Cape Breton North‚ÄîVictoria from 1925-1935. In the United States collateral descendants of Mathews include Fletcher Mathews Haight (1799-1856), a federal judge in California, who was a great nephew of Mathews and grandson of his brother James. His son Henry Huntly Haight was the 10th Governor of California. Mathews's brother, Fletcher Mathews, was ordered arrested by George Washington around the same time in June 1776 for suspicion of a \\"Scheme of Inlisting Men for the Kings Service\\". No evidence was found, and he was subsequently released.Letter from George Washington to Colonel James Clinton, 20 June 1776 US National Archives. Retrieved November 17, 2013 Fletcher was referred to in 1779 by Col.

Another of Mathews' brothers, James, of Cornwall, was arrested at the same time as he and Fletcher Mathews. He was released upon \\"taking the oath\\" to the patriot effort.Lamb, Martha Joanna. History of the City of New York: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress, Volume 2, Issue 1, 1880, page 78. James was the father of Vincent Mathews.

As well as holding sufficient guarantee of origin certificates to cover the electricity sold to consumers, suppliers are also required to show additionality by contributing to wider environmental and low carbon funds. Care needs to be taken in selecting a green energy supplier. A National Consumer Council report in December 2006 concluded that many green tariffs are not delivering the environmental benefits they claim to, and that consumers may not be making the positive contribution they think they are. Shades of green Renewables Obligation In the United Kingdom, suppliers are legally obliged to purchase a proportion of their electricity from renewable sources under the Renewables Obligation and there is a danger that energy suppliers may sell such green electricity under a premium 'green energy' tariff, rather than sourcing additional green electricity supplies.Green Electricity... Are you being conned? The Ecologist, published 2005-06-01, accessed 2007-06-07 In addition to selling the green electricity to the consumer, it is also possible for the supplier to sell the associated Renewables Obligation Certificates to another supplier who has failed to meet their quota, rather than 'retiring' the certificate from the marketplace.Why Friends of the Earth no longer produces a green electricity tariff league table, Friends of the Earth, published July 2005, accessed 2007-06-13 On several occasions in May 2016, Britain burned no coal for electricity for the first time since 1882. In April 2018, Britain burned no coal for a period of 76 hours, from 10am 21 April to 10am 24 April ‚Äì the longest period since the 19th century. Climate Change Levy Non- domestic consumers can avoid paying the Climate Change Levy by acquiring Levy Exemption Certificates from renewable energy suppliers. Since these are not required by domestic consumers, it is possible for the supplier to sell the certificates to the non-domestic sector, as well as selling the renewables obligation certificate and the electricity. Carbon offsetting Prior to the OFGEM green supply regulations, some green energy tariffs involved carbon offsetting, rather than purchasing or investing in renewable energy, a practice that does not meet with universal approval. George Monbiot, an English environmentalist and writer, has compared carbon offsets to the practice of purchasing indulgences during the Middle Ages, whereby people believed they could purchase forgiveness for their sins (instead of actually repenting and not sinning anymore). Monbiot also says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution.\\"The trade in carbon offsets is an excuse for business as usual\\" by George Monbiot, The Guardian, October 18, 2006. A reprint of the article may be accessed at on Monbiot's website. Also see \\"Carbon Offset Business Takes Root\\" by Martin Kaste, NPR, 28 November 2006. Reporting requirements In June 2008, Defra announced that, with effect from the financial year 2008/9, Green Electricity is to be treated the same as average grid electricity for carbon dioxide (CO2) reporting purposes. Previously, it was treated as if there were no CO2 emissions associated with it. Explaining the change, the Minister then responsible (Hilary Benn) saidDefra Press Release: Green Tariffs: Check what yours delivers 16 June 2008 \\"I want to make sure that the green tariff market, which has grown rapidly over recent years, is clear for consumers and businesses about the precise benefit their tariff brings. Many energy suppliers offer green tariffs to businesses and domestic customers who want to make a contribution to environmental projects or help tackle climate change, but these differ in what they deliver.\\" He added \\"It is increasingly difficult to demonstrate that buying a renewable electricity tariff is offering additional carbon emissions reductions compared with what suppliers are required to source to meet the Renewables Obligation. I have therefore decided that we will change the voluntary corporate reporting guidelines to bring them into line with current best practice and provide coherent carbon accounting. This will mean that for the reporting year 2008-9, best practice is expected to be for businesses to use a grid average rate ‚Äì average rate of carbon emissions associated with electricity transmitted on the national grid ‚Äì unless their supplier can prove the carbon benefits are additional.\\" This does not affect green electricity generated on site (e.g. from photovoltaics or a micro-wind turbine), which can continue to be reported as producing zero emissions. Certification schemes In 1999 the Future Energy national certification scheme for green electricity was launched, however it was closed in 2002, apparently because too few suppliers were prepared to accept the proposed revised requirements.Consumers left in the dark over green electricity, Friends of the Earth, published 2002-11-06, accessed 2007-06-08 In the absence of a replacement national scheme in the UK, the international Eugene Network, whose main purpose was to give accreditation to national green energy schemes, supported EcotricityEcotricity - committed to new renewable energy Eugene, accessed 2007-06-07 and indicates that Good Energy would be ready for accreditation should a Eugene Standard compliant scheme be introduced in the UK.Case Study: UK market lacks information Eugene, accessed 2007-06-07 The Eugene standard was discontinued in February 2009,Eugene Standard - Letter from Board about dismantling , Eugene, accessed 2010-02-26 leaving no internationally recognised means of comparing green electricity. Ofgem's 2007-8 Proposals In an attempt to end some of the premium priced offerings by suppliers which were doing no more than repackaging electricity that they had to buy under the Renewables Obligation, the UK Government's Office of Gas and Electricity Markets Ofgem proposed a voluntary scheme for independently verified energy ratingsNew energy ratings to help cut through green customer confusion (press release), accessed 2007-11-07 for electricity suppliers. Initially this was intended to include a detailed analysis of the carbon content of the supply, but some critics felt that this lacked sufficient emphasis on additionality, and the actual energy used by consumers from the grid was always a mix of brown and green sources. After running a series of workshops in early 2008, their proposals turned away from a focus on the source of electricity (and its associated carbon dioxide emissions), to look instead at whether an environmental benefit is demonstrated. Essentially, Ofgem suggest that this can only be done if the supplier invests part of payment received into one of the following activities:http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environmnt/Policy/Documents1/Green%20supply%20guidelines%20-%20proposals%20July%2008.pdf Ofgem: Green supply guidelines - proposals July 2008 * installation of energy efficiency technologies (outside of the Carbon Emission Reduction Target - CERT programme); * other consumer behaviour measures, such as active demand management or voluntary smart metering; * support for renewable heat installations; * additional investment in smaller-scale (e.g. community based) renewable electricity projects - a limit of 1MW has been suggested for wind farms - or in other low carbon sources including CHP and nuclear; * retirement of EU allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); * purchase of carbon offsets in line with Defra‚Äôs Quality Assurance Scheme for Carbon Offsetting, typically offsets from developing countries under the Clean Development Mechanism; * research and development into emerging renewable technologies; or * contribution to an environmental charity. The initial draft of the guidelines would have excluded most of the products currently available on the UK market, including offerings from renewable energy specialists Good Energy and Ecotricity. The Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme After consultation, Ofgem introduced modified Guidelines in February 2009.Final Green Supply Guidelines, Open letter dated 4 February 2009 These placed a greater emphasis on the matching principle, requiring that all electricity sold under the Scheme had to be matched by supplies from renewable sources (and excluding other low-carbon sources such as CHP or nuclear). The additionality criteria were simplified slightly to comprise:Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme website accessed 16 December 2010 * carbon offsets accredited either under the UK Government's Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) or under the Gold Standard * green energy schemes, mainly those that donate money to charities or to trust funds established to invest in new renewable projects ‚Äì generally at a community level, and required to be independent of the suppliers * energy efficiency schemes, making savings above those from CERT including savings in customers' premises through lower energy use * unspecified other measures, producing equivalent carbon savings Certified tariffs were subject to an annual audit, to ensure that the matching and additionality criteria have been met. Consumers must also be given information on the suppliers overall fuel mix at the point of sale. Although aimed mainly at domestic consumers, the scheme can also certify tariffs aimed at small businesses with an annual energy consumption below 50,000kWh. The Scheme was launched in February 2010, with the UK's Big Six energy suppliers as members as well as Good Energy. Ecotricity elected not to join the scheme citing concerns about the additionality rules.Ecotricity Press Release , 'New green energy guidelines from Ofgem are feel good but not do good says Ecotricity' All suppliers offer domestic tariffs, but only some have offered small business tariffs under the scheme. The Scheme, which closed in 2015, was controlled by an independent Panel chaired by Solitaire Townsend, and the National Energy Foundation were appointed as the secretariat.  Current OFGEM regulation  In response to concerns about the lack of regulation in the market for green electricity tariffs and in order to protect consumers, OFGEM has consulted and enacted changes to the green tariff market in the UK. Whereas previously the green tariff products were not subject to specific regulations, all retailers must now prove the green credentials of their products to OFGEM. The regulations have three components: # Electricity source - retailers need to hold sufficient Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin Certificates to match the quantity of electricity sold. Retailers are required to submit proof of this to the regulator. # Additionality - retailers also need to invest additional funds into other environmental projects. # Transparency - retailers are required to inform consumers of how their tariffs benefit the environment.  Areas of controversy  There have been several areas of controversy regarding green electricity sales in the UK. These have been related to both the concept as a whole, which has been subject to criticism, but have usually manifested as disputes between the two leading green electricity companies.  Retirement of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs)  In 2009 the founder of Ecotricity, Dale Vince, criticised Good Energy for their failure to retire a sufficient quantity of ROCs. Good Energy had previously promised to retire 5% of its ROCs, but Vince claimed they had consistently retired fewer ROCs than promised. He backed this up with evidence from OFGEM. It appears that after this dispute Good Energy did increase the number of ROCs it retired, but now seems to have ceased to do this entirely.  Advertising Standards Authority Case  In 2016 Ecotricity claimed in an advertisement that it was the greenest energy supplier. This claim was disputed by Tesla Motors and subsequently thrown out. The judgement faced criticism from Good Energy, with its managing director David Brooks saying ‚ÄúThe ASA appears to have based its decision purely on data provided by Ecotricity without considering whether that data represents an objective view. Obviously, the criteria Ecotricity has chosen to measure itself against other companies has been selected to suit Ecotricity. We don‚Äôt think the ASA has considered what it calls ‚Äúsuitable comparative data‚Äù before reaching its conclusions.\\" Worsening greenhouse gas emissions In the UK, wood counts as a renewable fuel and the Drax power station burns a large mass of it.

'Na Piarsaigh √ìga', which translates as 'the Young Pearses', takes its name from the Irish revolutionaries P√°draic and Willie Pearse. The club's crest includes a sword in flames, a symbol associated with P√°draic Pearse since his editorship of the nationalist newspaper An Claidheamh Soluis, surrounded by the green and gold club colours and a skyline of Armagh city.Armagh GAA website History The club was formed in 1950 as a result of the popular street leagues that were running at the time. The founder members met in Dougan's Loft, Navan Street, Armagh. They included Charlie McQuade, Felix McStravick, Sam Johnson, Gene McStravick, Eugene McKenna, Gerry Cush and the legendary Ulster footballer Big Jim McCullagh, who became the Pearse √ìgs' inaugural chairman. The club's name was suggested by Seamy Trainor. Their home ground for many years was the Athletic Grounds at Drumarg in the west of the city. Pearse √ìg won their first Armagh Senior Football Championship title in 1985 defeating local rivals Armagh Harps in the final. The backbone of this team was formed by players who had won the County U-21 Championship in 1976 and back-to-back Minor titles from 1981 to 1983. Prominent members of this team were future All-star Gerard Houlahan, his county teammates Colin Harney and Brian Hughes and team captain Sean Gordon. In 2002 the √ìgs had four players on the Armagh All-Ireland winning panel, Simon Maxwell, Pauric Duffy, Kieran Hughes and Ronan Clarke. Former senior player Eamon Mackle was heavily involved in Armagh's success along with Armagh coach Paul Grimley. In 2007, the Armagh panel added √ìgs players Andy Mallon, Ciaran McKinney and Paul Duffy, with Maxwell and Pauric Duffy stepping down. The club acquired a new ground in 2007, and has developed the site, at Ballycrummy on the western outskirts of the city, as Pearse √ìg Park. In 2007 Pearse √ìg under-14 had a memorable year winning five trophies including the Mid-Armagh League, Championship and Feile. In 2009 Pearse √ìg again beat Armagh Harps in the county final by 0-8 to 0-4. The club reached the 2012 Senior final but lost to the club that had dominated county football for many years, Crossmaglen Rangers.

Life O'Neill was born at 16 Young Street in Kensington, London, the youngest son of the Irish painter George Bernard O'Neill and Emma Stuart Callcott. He studied in London with Arthur Somervell and with Iwan Knorr at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt from 1893 to 1897. His studies there were facilitated by Eric Stenbock.Timothy D'Arch Smith, Love in Earnest (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1970), p. 35.

Scowcroft (accessed 13 June 2007). A very sociable man, he was a member of the Savage Club, where he liked to meet musical colleagues. He and Adine frequently hosted fellow composers and musicians at their house, 4 Pembroke Villas in Kensington, including Frederick Delius, Theodore Holland, Gustav Holst, Ernest Irving, Percy Grainger and Cyril Scott. On 12 February 1934 O'Neill was walking East on Oxford Street on his way to Broadcasting House for a recording session. As a crossed Holles Street he was struck by a carrier tricycle. As a result he developed blood poisoning and died on 3 March. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, London, as was his wife in 1947. There is a plaque there in memory to both of them. Music O'Neill was associated with the Haymarket Theatre. His works for the stage include over fifty sets of incidental music for plays, including many by Shakespeare (Hamlet, King Lear, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, The Merchant of Venice, Henry V and Measure for Measure), J. M. Barrie (A Kiss for Cinderella and Mary Rose), and Maurice Maeterlinck (The Blue Bird). Mary Rose, perhaps his best received theatre score, first opened in London at the Haymarket on 22 April 1920, continuing until 26 February 1921, with Fay Compton as Mary Rose, a role which was written for her by Barrie.The Times, 23 April 1920. Ernest Irving, who deputised as conductor for O'Neill on many occasions, compared a performance of Mary Rose without his music to \\"a dance by a fairy with a wooden leg.\\"Hudson, Derek, letter to The Listener, 9 April 1959, p. 639. The play was revived (with many of the same cast still in place) in 1926.The Times, 22 January 1926. In 1910, O'Neill became the first British composer to conduct his own orchestral music on record, directing the Columbia Graphophone Company's house ensemble, the \\"Court Symphony Orchestra\\", in a suite taken from his Blue Bird music on two double-sided gramophone discs. He received personal congratulations from Sir Edward Elgar. on his music for the innovative central ballet sequence of the 1924 revue The Punch Bowl, which ran for over a year with O'Neill's contribution being widely singled out for praise in press coverage.E.g., first night reviews (22 May 1924) in Daily Telegraph, p. 13; The Times, p. 14; Daily Mail, p. 10; The Star, p. 3; Daily Sketch, p. 3. O'Neill's works also include a number of symphonic suites, chamber and instrumental music, most of it written pre-war, before his theatre music career took off.

The species is native to Europe and Siberia, but is also found in North America, where it is an invasive species. While it was initially recorded in Hawaii, this was actually a misidentification of Acrolepiopsis sapporensis. The leek moth is similar in appearance to other members of the genus Acrolepiopsis, with mottled brown and white wings. Its wing span is approximately 12 mm across. It is a pest of leek crops, as the larvae feed on several species of Allium by mining into the leaves or bulbs. The shape of the leaf mine is variable, ranging from a corridor to a blotch, and can be with or without frass. This leaf mining can occur in the tubular leaves or in the stem. In the case of onions and shallots, the larvae mine into the bulb. In North America, where the moth is an invasive species and has few known natural predators, the species threatens the production and biodiversity of Allium, and it has the potential to destroy entire crops. The parasitoid Diadromus pulchellus is used to control the spread of and damage caused by the leek moth in Europe and North America.  Description  The wings are brown mottled with white spots and measure about 12 mm across. High individual variation in wing pattern can make the leek moth difficult to distinguish from other Acrolepiopsis species at first, but its distinct genitalia make it easily identifiable. Males of this species can be identified by their long saccus, a portion of the male genitalia used for grasping females, and females by their long and flat ductus bursae, a portion of the female reproductive tract.  Distribution  The leek moth is native to Europe, where it is present throughout the entire continent. Scandinavia and Russia mark the northwestern and northeastern bounds of its range, respectively, and its presence extends to Algeria in the south. It is an invasive species in North America, where it was first discovered in Canada in 1993. It has since expanded its North American range to include parts of Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, New York, and Nova Scotia. Climate models suggest that the leek moth's range could continue to expand to encompass a larger portion of eastern North America.  Larval host plants   Host plant selection  The female leek moth selects the host plant for oviposition. She is drawn to the plant through thiosulphinates, chemical attractants released by the plant. Egg-laying does not take place immediately, however; it occurs only after longer contact with the leaf, during which time another chemical signal cues oviposition. Propyl-cysteine-sulfoxide has been shown to induce egg-laying in the leek moth and could be involved in host plant selection as a characteristic signal of Allium.left  Host plant preference  Larvae feed on plants of the genus Allium, including: * Allium cepa ‚Äì onion * Allium sativum ‚Äì garlic * Allium porrum ‚Äì leek * Allium ampeloprasum ‚Äì elephant garlic * 'Allium cepa var. aggregatum' ‚Äì shallot * Allium schoenoprasum ‚Äìchive * Allium cernuum ‚Äì nodding onion * Allium stellatum ‚Äì prairie onion The leek moth prefers A. sativum, garlic, A. porrum, leek, and A. cepa, onion, to other species of Allium.  Oviposition  Oviposition takes place in three behavioral stages: slow walking, pausing, and egg-laying. When given the choice between plants of the same species and of different sizes, females choose to lay their eggs on the larger plant.  Life cycle  Leek moth larva Development time from egg to adult is variable depending on temperature, generally ranging from 3 weeks at higher temperatures to 6 weeks at lower temperatures. Likewise, the number of generations possible each year depends on local climate conditions. Whereas three or more generations can typically be completed in Ontario, France, and Poland, only two can be completed in Sweden. Adults emerge in the spring and lay eggs within 10 days of adulthood. Eggs are laid on the leaves of the larval host plant, into which first instar larvae mine and subsequently complete five instars, reaching a length of 13‚Äì14 mm when mature. Larvae are light yellow-green in color with a brownish-yellow head. After reaching maturity, fifth instar larvae emerge from the host plant and spin a cocoon, on the host plant or nearby. Cocoons are white in color, pupa reddish-brown. If daylengths during previous larval stages are shorter than 15 hours, emergent adults will enter diapause to overwinter. Otherwise, adults lay another generation of eggs.  Predators  Knowledge of the leek moth's natural predators in North America is limited, but several larval and pupal parasitoids of the species have been documented in Europe. Parasitoids lay their eggs within or attached to the body of the host, the parasitoid larvae ultimately killing the host. Parasitoids are shown to parasitize the leek moth to a greater extent when leek moth populations are large and in early leek moth generations, suggesting that parasitism is less significant in smaller populations and in later generations. The leek moth is most vulnerable to parasitism in its pupal stage when it is no longer protected by the interior of its host plant. Diadromus pulchellus, a host-specific parasitoid of the leek moth, has been introduced in the Ottawa region in Canada as a biological control method for the invasive moth.  Mating  General structure of n-alkanes, the major components of male sexual pheromones During mating, males respond to calling females with the emission of a pheromone containing n-alkanes. Males flutter their wings, which acts to volatilize the pheromone through heat generation and disturb the pheromone molecules. The pheromone acts as an aphrodisiac for the female while inhibiting the sexual behavior of other males. These compounds can be transferred to the female during mating and their sexual inhibitory effects on conspecific males favor the monogamy seen in the leek moth.  Physiology   Flight  In eastern Ontario, the leek moth undergoes three flight periods each year. The first flight period peaks in mid-May and consists of overwintering adults. The second peaks in early July and consists of first generation adults. The third peaks from late July to late August and consists of second generation adults. This pattern again suggests that three generations can be completed each summer in Ontario.  Olfaction  Females rely on the olfactory detection of volatile chemoattractants in host plant selection. Experiments suggest that the diets of female leek moths reared in laboratory conditions impact sensitivity to chemoattractants. When two strains of moths were raised in the laboratory, one fed leek leaves and the other fed an artificial diet supplemented with leek powder, the former strain showed greater sensitivity to volatile leek compounds. Furthermore, the strain fed leek leaves became progressively less sensitive to volatiles each generation.  Diapause  Adults enter diapause to overwinter when daylengths during their larval stage are less than 15 hours long. This corresponds to the end of the breeding season and involves adults of the last generation of the summer. During diapause, mating and sex organ growth halt.  Invasive species  Leek moth damage to Allium porrum The leek moth is an invasive species in North America. It was first discovered in North America in Ottawa, Canada in 1993, and was found in the United States 16 years later in Plattsburgh, New York in 2009. It has since spread throughout much of eastern North America and its range is projected to expand further into the United States and Canada. A pest of Allium crops, the leek moth poses threats both to Allium production and biodiversity. The larvae mine into the plant, reducing plant growth and causing physical damage. Organic farmers are especially vulnerable to the pest. The leek moth has few known natural predators in North America, resulting in greater pest pressure than in Europe and causing severe damage to Allium plants, sometimes resulting in the loss of entire crops. Control Several methods of leek moth pest control have been tested, including intercropping and trap cropping. Intercropping involves the growing of additional crops alongside the pest-susceptible crop to encourage oviposition on these additional crops. Intercropping has been found to be ineffective at controlling the spread of and damage caused by the leek moth. When trap cropping is implemented, more eggs are laid on the trap crops than on the primary crop. Research on leek moth pest control is ongoing. Bibliography * Carter, D. (1984).

The 2007 Asian heat wave affected the South Asian countries of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, as well as Russia, Japan and the People's Republic of China. The heat wave ran during the months of May and June, which continued to September in Japan. India Heat-related deaths were reported from the capital New Delhi, northern Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. After three days of intense heat with temperatures hovering about 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F), New Delhi was relieved as the temperature slid down to 37.2 ¬∞C (99.0 ¬∞F). Meanwhile, the temperature soared to more than 46 ¬∞C (115 ¬∞F) at several places in northern Madhya Pradesh, with Datia turning out to be the hottest at 48 ¬∞C (118 ¬∞F). More than 120 peacocks died in Tughlaqabad Fort and Surajkund due to the heat; additionally, reports of severe water shortages were common. A total of 400 peacocks died in Madhya Pradesh, about 200 of those being in Haryana and Punjab alone. The cotton crop in Punjab was severely affected by the heat wave. Meanwhile, the persisting heat wave in various parts of Chandigarh rendered milk cattle dry. When the day temperature hovered around +48 ¬∞C (118 ¬∞F), milk supply to various milk plants of cooperative unions went down by 40,000 litres per day. In addition, milk collection by private-sector plants was reduced by 160,000 litres during the same period. Bangladesh Coming at the end of May, a heat wave left at least 25 people dead. According to hospital sources most victims of the heat were rice farmers working in terraces exposed to the blazing sun for long periods. Nearly 200 people, including several children, were admitted to hospitals with symptoms of heat stroke. According to the meteorological office in Dhaka many northern towns showed day temperatures reaching over +40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F), which is not normal in the Bangladeshi summer. Additionally, there was a high level of humidity. Nepal A heat wave affected the livelihood of a large number of poverty-stricken families who depend on day outdoor labour done outdoors, such as constructing roads, driving rickshaws, selling vegetables, making quilts and farming. According to the government's Department of Meteorology the temperature in Nepalganj got up as high as +44 ¬∞C (111 ¬∞F). It is estimated that at least 11 people died. Pakistan The heat wave over Pakistan was claimed to have brought the death toll there up to 192. The meteorological department registered a record maximum temperature of +52 ¬∞C (126 ¬∞F) in Sibi. Four people died as the temperature in Lahore touched +48 ¬∞C (118 ¬∞F) on 9 June, which was a record for the previous 78 years. Russia The heat waves hit Russia at the end of May. The temperature in Moscow reached +32.9 ¬∞C (91.2 ¬∞F) on 27 May. The Russian capital had not seen such a sustained heat wave for 128 years. On 28 May an absolute temperature record for May was set, breaking the record of +31.8 ¬∞C (89.2 ¬∞F) that had been registered back in 1891. The heat also affected agriculture, wiping out about 5,000 km¬≤ of spring sown fields. Animals at Moscow Zoo found it hard to keep cool. Staff had to prevent walruses from bathing in their pool because the water was too warm for them. China Beijing opened up its warren of old air raid shelters to help people escape from the heat. The heat also set off explosives at a chemical plant in Shanxi. The explosions injured hundreds of people nearby. Japan Most of Japanese cities are highest level of an average temperature, since May to September. According to Meteorological Agency of Japan confirm report, the highest temperature recorded on Celsius 40.9 degrees hitting in Kumagaya, Saitama and Tajimi, Gifu, Celsius 40.3 degrees hitting in Koshigaya, Saitama, on 16 August. And above Celsius 29 degrees of average temperature points are Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Takamatsu, Shikoku. In September, major Japanese cities are recorded to high temperature of Celsius 32 to 37 degrees levels, with highest level of an average temperature in September, since 1868. According to Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan confirm report, resulting to 923 people death of hyperthermia by heat wave in around Japan, and worst heat stroke disaster of Japanese and North Esat Asia's history.

He was the runner-up on the BBC reality talent show Any Dream Will Do, which offered the chance to be the next West End Joseph for the hit musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. He lost out to Lee Mead in the final on 9 June 2007.  Early life  Before his appearances on Any Dream Will Do he was studying performance skills in Edinburgh and an HNC in Musical Theatre at Telford College also in Edinburgh. Since winning the 2006 Chicago Rock Caf√© Rock Idol contest, held in the English West Midlands, he has been a student of celebrity vocal coach Carrie Grant, best known for belonging to Sweet Dreams, which came sixth in the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest and working on UK television talent contests, including Fame Academy, Comic Relief does Fame Academy and Pop Idol. Keith Jack attended St. David's High School in Dalkeith where he performed in various Christmas concerts and other precarious events.  Any Dream Will Do  Since the start of Any Dream Will Do, Keith Jack was noted as a strong contender. His vocals, in particular, were praised very highly. The main criticisms thrown at him were his diction and his physical appearance: some judges thought he looked 'too young' to play Joseph. However, by the end of the series, Keith was widely regarded as the strongest singer on the programme. John Barrowman and vocal coach Zoe Tyler in particular were full of praise. Barrowman said: \\"That was brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, son! You have a voice of gold.\\" Tyler commented: \\"When I hear you sing now, you knock me for six.\\" Denise van Outen described Keith as a \\"Young John Barrowman\\", while Bill Kenwright called Keith's talents \\"frightening\\". The panel was particularly impressed with his performances of \\"Love Is All Around\\", \\"Always on My Mind,\\" \\"Could It Be Magic\\" and \\"For Once in My Life\\".  After Any Dream Will Do  The Stage Quest student and former supermarket worker performed at 30 June 2007's Picnic in the Parliament concert outside the Scottish Parliament. \\"As my first performance since the final, I am proud it will be not only in Scotland but on a day celebrating Scottish talent,\\" the Scottish Parliament's website quoted him as saying. On 28 June 2007, The Scotsman published an article stating that Keith was entering a record deal with Louis Walsh, the fruition of which was to be an album of pop, classical and theatrical music. Alas this was not meant to be, and Keith asked Adam Quest (StageQuest), his mentor and vocal coach of some 14 months to try to broker a new recording deal on his behalf. Within a week Keith was signed to John Mclaughlin's (Sandy Tomm, Busted, 911, Attic Lights, Teenage Fanclub) record label X-Phonics in Glasgow. From October 2007, Keith has been in Bill Kenwright's national touring production of Joseph, starring as the Narrator, alongside fellow Any Dream Will Do contestants Craig Chalmers (who will be playing Joseph) and Chris Barton (who will be playing Benjamin). For some matinees, Chris Barton plays the narrator or Joseph. Keith Jack recorded his debut album early in 2008. A charity single of \\"When a Child is Born\\" was released via download on 10 December 2007. \\"If an Angel falls from Heaven\\" was available to download from 8 December 2008. Keith will be recording his next album during the early months of 2009. In August 2008, Keith performed in the premier of the musical Only the Brave at the Edinburgh Festival. In June 2008 he performed in the \\"Choices for Life\\" tour, which is for children in Primary 7 across Scotland. Also in June 2008 Keith Jack performed at Bo'ness Children's Fair Day His debut CD was released on 22 September and entitled This Time. He toured England and Scotland in September and October 2008 to promote the album. He also sang \\"Uptown Girl\\" with Daniel Boys and Ben James- Ellis on John Barrowman's album Music Music Music. December 2008 through to January 2009 saw Keith in Panto playing the title role in Peter Pan alongside Alan Fletcher (Dr. Karl Kennedy from Neighbours) at His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen. He also met Derek Anderson at this venue. Also, on 31 December 2008, Keith performed for half an hour at the Aberdeen Hogmanay Street Party, alongside Sandi Thom and Amy McDonald. A second tour followed in late summer 2009. When Lee Mead's Contract expired, Keith was asked if he wanted to take over. He rejected the offer and continued to tour with Chris and Craig. Keith performed as part of Showstopppers! at Musical Theatre @ George Square as part of the Edinburgh Fringe on 17 August 2009. Keith performed in panto at the Kings Theatre, Glasgow in 2009 as Aladdin. At Croydon Saturday 17 July 2010 at the 2 pm Show Keith took over the coloured coat from Craig and began his Debut Performance as Joseph. From 2 December ‚Äì 8 January 2011 Keith played The Prince in the Kings Theatre, Glasgow production of Sleeping Beauty. In 2012 Keith played Joseph in the UK tour opposite Jennifer Potts as narrator. From 18 December to 6 January 2013, Keith played Prince Charming in Cinderella at the Whitely Bay Playhouse. Keith finally hung up the \\"Dreamcoat\\" in May 2013 after 6 on and off years in the musical. He has passed the role on to Ian \\"H\\" Watkins from Steps. Since moving on from Joseph, it was announced that Keith would be returning to the stage leading a brand new musical Sincerely, Mr Toad with Sell A Door Theatre Company. Keith played \\"The Prince\\" at Ipswich Regent's pantomime production of Sleeping Beauty, which ran from 17 December 2016 until 2 January 2017. Keith joined Magic Beans in their 2017/18 production of Snow White at The Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks.

It is the third installment in the Warlords Battlecry series and the sequel to Warlords Battlecry II. Gameplay While Warlords Battlecry III is primarily a real-time strategy game, it has some elements of role-playing video game in that players can complete optional quests, as well as create a customized Hero character that can level up from battle to battle and equip unique and powerful items. The Campaign is a mixture of an overhead strategic map with real-time gameplay. Departing from the system used in Warlords Battlecry II, which consisted of a Risk-style board with territories, Warlords Battlecry III divides the world of Etheria into numerous locations (mostly cities) that players travel between, with various events at each. Almost all of the map locations have missions to play, some of which are not readily visible until other missions have been completed, as well as shops, academies, and/or mercenaries for hire. Once a player enters a mission, the game switches to real-time strategy gameplay reminiscent of games such as Warcraft and Age of Empires. Players use four resources, Gold, Metal, Crystal and Stone, which are used to produce a variety of structures and units. Unlike many other RTS games, resources are present as neutral buildings which can be captured and destroyed (not permanently) and generate resources automatically without player input. Although magic and spells come into play, games are usually decided by the player who has a combination of an overwhelming number of superior units and better micromanaging of his Hero character. The Hero typically becomes extremely powerful by the late game and can slay dozens of normal units alone. Warlords Battlecry III is unique in its replay ability due to the diplomacy system and the number of races in the game. Depending on which missions have been completed and what was their original race selection, players can be Enemies, Neutral, Friendly, or Allied (which makes that race playable) with each of the 16 races. Preprogrammed biases explained in the backstory mean that it is more difficult for a player to be allied with two warring races, such as Dwarves and Plaguelords, but it is possible. Features Warlords Battlecry III has more factions and hero types than the earlier games in the series, with 16 different races and 28 varying character classes. Heroes have groups of loyal soldiers called retinues, which will follow and fight for them in battle, and the level cap for units was increased to 20 in this game, up from 7. The human faction was split in this game into two new races: the Empire and the Knights, and the new races of Swarm, Plaguelord, and Ssrathi were introduced. Each old race received at least one new unit, sometimes several. New magic spells were added, including the all-new Arcane, Poison, and Divination schools. Several new hero classes were added, as well as a brand-new campaign engine and a completely new hero level-up method that includes the ability to level up in the middle of a battle (players were previously restricted to leveling up after battles only). Each faction has a titan that is available at the end of the tech tree, but is extremely powerful, capable of laying waste to whole armies and can strike terror to the hearts of enemy troops.  Critical Reception  Warlords Battlecry III received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to review aggregate Metacritic.

Strathcona High School (1968-1971) Fryer was a three-sport athlete at Strathcona High School in Edmonton from the fall of 1968 to the spring of 1971, starring on the Lords' football, basketball and track and field teams all three years. As an intermediate boy in his grade 11 year at the Alberta Schools Athletic Association provincial track and field meet in Calgary, Fryer won and set the ASAA record for the 120 yard hurdles with a time of 14.4 seconds. The following year at the provincial championship in Edmonton, Fryer once again won the 120 yard hurdles, setting a new record of 14.2 seconds. He also smashed the records in both the long jump (7.08m) and triple jump (13.8m), setting standards that stood for almost two decades before being surpassed. In total Fryer won four gold medals and set three provincial records in ASAA competition. In his last year Fryer was awarded the Most Outstanding Athlete award.  University of Alberta (1972-1975) From 1972 to 1975 Fryer was a dominant wide receiver for the University of Alberta football team. In his first season the Alberta Golden Bears went 9-1 and beat Waterloo Lutheran University (now Wilfrid Laurier University) 20-7 for the Vanier Cup symbolizing Canadian University football supremacy. On October 12, 1974, Fryer set a single game Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports) record with 227 yards receiving against the University of Calgary. In 1974, he set a single season CIS record with 58 receptions, and recorded the first 1000-yard receiving season in CIS history with a record 1068 yards. In addition he scored 16 touchdowns, including a CIS record 14 receiving touchdowns. His total of 16 touchdowns on the season was the third highest total in a single season, behind Paul Brule's 25 touchdowns at St. Francis Xavier University in 1967 and Brule's 20 touchdowns at St. FX in 1966. He finished 1974 as an all Canadian all-star and was nominated as the Canada West's nominee for the Hec Creighton Trophy. In 1975 Fryer made 51 receptions for 943 yards during the season and won the Hec Crighton Trophy awarded annually to the most outstanding football player in Canadian Interuniversity Sport. As well, he was on the all Canadian all star team. Fryer finished his career at the University of Alberta with the CIS records for most receiving yards in a game, a season and a career, and the records for most receptions in a season and a career, and the most receiving touchdowns in a season. He made a record 136 career receptions, for a record 2655 career yards receiving. His career total of 34 touchdowns was second on the CIS career list to the 51 scored by Paul Brule at St. Francis Xavier University from 1964-1967. His career total of 20 receiving touchdowns tied him for second all-time with Mike Kirkpatrick of Saint Mary's University (Halifax), six behind Eric Walter's record 26 at McGill University. This was quite an accomplishment considering he was only a starting receiver for only two years (1974/75). Fryer also totaled 1068 rushing yards and 505 kickoff return yards during his four years at Alberta. Accomplishments were: 2 Time Western and All Canadian All-Star. 1974 Canada West Hec Crighton nominee. 1975 Winner of the Hec Creighton Trophy as the most outstanding football player in CIS. 1975 Winner of the University of Alberta Wilson Challenge Trophy as the most outstanding male athlete. 1983...Initial inductee into the University of Alberta Sports Wall of Fame.  Washington Redskins (1976-1978) Fryer's accomplishments at the University of Alberta caught the attention of Bob Windish, the director of player personnel for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. After watching Fryer at a practice in September 1975 he passed a report on to Alouettes head coach Marv Levy. Levy, who was once an assistant with the Washington Redskins of the NFL, told Redskins head coach George Allen that Fryer was a player with NFL potential. Redskins director of player personnel Tim Temerario and director of college scouting Mark Allman paid visits to Alberta that winter to assess Fryer's abilities. As a result, the Redskins selected Fryer with the 234th pick in the 8th round of the NFL draft on April 8, 1976. As an Edmonton-born and trained player, Fryer's CFL negotiating rights were held by the Edmonton Eskimos by territorial exemption, but the Redskins easily exceeded the Eskimos' top offer of around $100,000. On April 28 Fryer signed a three-year contract with Washington for $155,000, plus a $15,000 signing bonus and a new car, making him the first Canadian born player trained at a Canadian university to be drafted, signed by an NFL club and make a team as a rookie. Fryer was one of 34 rookies at the Redskins training camp that summer, but the only one who made the team. He caught seven passes for 110 yards and scored one touchdown in pre-season exhibition play and was slotted into the lineup as a special teams player. Fryer returned nine kickoffs for 166 yards in four NFL regular season games before strained ligaments in his knee ended his season. They would be the only four NFL regular season games Fryer would play. He spent the 1977 season rehabbing on the practice roster, before parting ways with the team in 1978.  CFL career (1978-1985) Fryer continued his pro career in the CFL with the Edmonton Eskimos in 1978. The Eskimos were a league powerhouse that had played in the Grey Cup championship game in four of the previous five seasons, and were loaded with star players including running back Jim Germany, receiver Waddell Smith and future Hall of Famers Tom Wilkinson (Canadian football) and George McGowan. In 1978 two more future Hall of Famers were added to the roster in receiver Tom Scott (Canadian football) and future NFL great Warren Moon. As a result, Fryer's contributions to the Eskimos' Grey Cup winning 1978 season were minimal; he played in nine of the team's 16 games and caught 20 passes for 293 yards and one touchdown. Fryer's opportunities were reduced again during the 1979 season, as future Hall of Famer Brian Kelly (Canadian football) joined Smith and Scott to form the most dangerous receiving corps in the league. Fryer appeared in only two games as the Eskimos won a second consecutive Grey Cup. Injuries to Smith and Scott allowed Fryer to become a more regular contributor to the Eskimos during the 1980 season. He appeared in 15 games and caught 23 passes for 408 yards and two touchdowns. In the post-season he caught four passes for 77 yards as Edmonton won its third consecutive Grey Cup, 48-10 over the Hamilton Tiger- Cats. In 1981 Scott, Kelly and Smith caught passes for 3982 yards as the trio combined with Wilkinson and Moon in an aerial assault on CFL defences. The team went 14-1-1 and won their fourth Grey Cup in four years, but Fryer only appeared in one game all season, catching a single pass for 11 yards after being in a season-ending injury the first game of the season. Fryer had his finest pro year in 1982, as the dangerous receiving trio of Scott, Kelly and Smith became a quartet. Fryer made 55 catches for 812 yards and a pair of touchdowns, and made four receptions for 55 yards in the Grey Cup game as the Eskimos won an record fifth consecutive championship. Fryer had 46 receptions for 639 yards in Moon's final CFL season of 1983, and had 464 yards in 1984. He appeared in eight games for Edmonton in 1985 before finishing the season, and his pro career, with three games for the Ottawa Rough Riders. His CFL totals in 83 regular season games over eight years are 179 receptions, 2670 yards and seven touchdowns.  After football  Since his retirement in 1985, Brian has been employed as the Executive Director of Football Alberta, administering all amateur football programs in the province. Since 1995, Brian is still an active member of the Edmonton Eskimo Alumni Association as a Director, President and chair of Casino and Scholarship committees. Fryer was announced for induction into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on February 21, 2013 in recognition of his CIS playing career with the Alberta Golden Bears.Football Canada release on Fryer's induction into the CFHOF (Feb. 21/2013) - Fryer was inducted into the Alberta Schools Athletic Association Sports Hall of Fame in 2008 and inducted into the City of Edmonton's Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

Joseph Bloom founded the company in the spring of 1913; by August, the company moved into the former Carhartt Motor Car Company factory. The car itself was designed by Bloom's brother-in-law Robert C. Hupp, of Hupmobile fame.Kimes, Beverly Rae. Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1805-1942 (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, 1996), p.990.

Later that same year, an even smaller 4-cylinder car was made, this one selling for US$675. The Monarch was called \\"The Car with the Silver Wheels\\" in company advertisements. History Hupp wanted to expand the lineup into larger vehicles, so he designed one with a 4.6L V8 engine. The five-passenger open model weighed and was priced at $1,500. It was originally equipped with a Continental Six engine. This expansion of the lineup required a new cash infusion. Automobile Journal reported in May 1915 various Detroit backers had invested \\"new capital of large proportions\\"Kimes, p.991. in the company. The new V8 Monarch entered production for a brief period, but production could not be sustained, as the new investment never materialized. This resulted in the company being declared bankrupt in the spring of 1916. At that time, assets were declared to be US$20,833 and liabilities US$5,753. By November, rights to the Monarch had been purchased by the Carter Brothers of Hyattsville, Maryland. In order to \\"conserve the value of the name,\\"Kimes, p.265. the Monarch name would be kept.

Species There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Aguarunichthys inpai Zuanon, Rapp Py-Daniel & J√©gu, 1993 * Aguarunichthys tocantinsensis Zuanon, Rapp Py-Daniel & J√©gu, 1993 * Aguarunichthys torosus Stewart, 1986 Etymology Aguarunichthys is derived from Aguaruna, the name of a society of people from where A. torosus was collected, as well as ichthys, meaning fish. The species name of A. torosus is derived from the Latin brawny or muscular for its body form. A. tocantinsensis is named for the Tocantins River from which it was first collected. A. inpai is a latinization of the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA). Distribution and habitat A. inpai inhabits the middle Amazon River basin in Brazil, A. tocantinsensis originates from the Tocantins River basin in Brazil, and A. torosus is known from the Cenepa River basin of the Amazon River drainage in Peru. A. tocantinsensis has been found in areas with strong currents and rocky bottom. On the other hand, A. inpai inhabits areas where the riverbed consists of sediments. These fish species are rarely captured and are unknown to the local fishermen; this may be due to their deep-bottom dwelling habits. Description Aguarunichthys was originally described due to the distinctive finger-like projections of the gas bladder. There are three pairs of barbels, one pair of long maxillary barbels and two pairs of shorter chin barbels. A. inpai has small spots on a cream-coloured body, while the other two species have large darker spots on an olive-brown body.

It was a giant, ground-dwelling bipedal omnivore with a shearing bite as indicated by the preserved mandible. Supplementary Information Discovery and naming Manual ungual of LH V0011. In a quarry at Saihangaobi, Iren Dabasu Formation, Erlian basin, Sonid Left Banner (Inner Mongolia), numerous remains of the sauropod Sonidosaurus have been uncovered since 2001. Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing was asked to reenact the discovery of Sonidosaurus in April 2005 for a Japanese documentary. Xu obliged them by digging out a thighbone. As he wiped the bone clean, he suddenly realized it was not from a sauropod, but from an unidentified theropod in the size class of Albertosaurus. He then stopped the filming to secure the serendipitous find. This way, the discovery of the Gigantoraptor holotype fossil was documented on film. That holotype, LH V0011, consists of the incomplete and disassociated remains of a single subadult individual, preserving a nearly complete mandible, a partial isolated cervical vertebra, dorsal vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, right scapula, right humerus, right radius and ulna, nearly complete right manus, partial ilium with a nearly complete pubis and hind limbs, including both femur, tibia and fibula with virtually complete pes. In 2007, the type species Gigantoraptor erlianensis was named and described by Xu, Tan Qingwei, Wang Jianmin, Zhao Xijin and Tan Lin. The generic name, Gigantoraptor, is derived from the Latin gigas, gigantis, meaning \\"giant\\" and raptor, meaning \\"seizer\\". The specific name, erlianensis, refers to the Erlian Basin. Description Size of the holotype and a potential egg compared to a human Life restoration It was clear to Xu et al. that Gigantoraptor belonged to the Oviraptorosauria, a group named after Oviraptor, but compared to other known members, Gigantoraptor was much larger, approximately three times as long and 35 times more massive than the heaviest earlier discovered oviraptorosaurid Citipati. Xu et al. estimated its length at , a height of and the weight at , but Xu et al. infer that Gigantoraptor reached its young adult size within seven years and was still at relatively early young adult stage at the time of death, and estimate that a full-sized Gigantoraptor is considerably heavier than . Nevertheless, Gigantoraptor was an enormous animal with an estimated length of and a massive weight of . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight InformationMolina- P√©rez & Larramendi 2016. R√©cords y curiosidades de los dinosaurios Ter√≥podos y otros dinosauromorfos, Larousse. Barcelona, Spain p. 271 The preserved mandible of Gigantoraptor is fused into a broad shovel-like shape, indicating that the unknown skull was over half a metre long and toothless also, probably equipped with a horny beak. The anterior caudal vertebrae have very long neural spines and are heavily pneumaticised with deep pleurocoels. The middle section of the relatively short tail is somewhat stiffened by long prezygapophyses. The caudal vertebrae are lightened by spongeous bone. The forelimbs are rather long because of an elongated slender manus. The humerus is bowed outwards to an exceptionally large extent and has a very rounded head. The first metacarpal is very short and carries a strongly diverging thumb. The hindlimbs are relatively elongated, a trait also mentioned by Holtz. The femur is slender with a distinct head and neck, measuring . The pes is robust with large and strongly curved pedal unguals. No direct evidence of feathers was preserved with the skeleton, but Xu et al. discussed their likely presence on Gigantoraptor. They admitted that despite Gigantoraptor being a member of the Oviraptorosauria, a group that includes the feathered species Caudipteryx and Protarchaeopteryx, it might have been \\"naked\\" because it is three hundred times as massive as these species, and very large animals may rely more on mass for temperature regulation, losing the insulating coverings found on their smaller relatives. However, they suggested that at least arm feathers were probably still present on Gigantoraptor, since their primary functions, such as display and covering the eggs while brooding, are not related to the regulation of body heat. Distinguishing characteristics Hind view of reconstructed skeleton Skeletal reconstruction According to Xu et al. 2007, Gigantoraptor can be recognised by the following traits: reduced mandible with 45% less length compared to the femur; anterior caudal vertebrae with elongated neural spines and posteriorly located stocky, rod-like transverse processes; dentary with elongated postero-ventral process reaching to the level of the glenoid; reduced posteriorly tapered retro articular process much deeper than its wide; anterior and middle caudal vertebrae with a large pneumatic opening on the ventral surface; dentary with two fossa on the lateral surface and close to the external mandibular fenestra; anterior caudal centrum with postero-ventral margin extending ventrally; advanced laminal system of the anterior caudal vertebrae; vertical prezygapophyseal articular facets located proximal to the distal end of the process in the middle caudal vertebrae; scapula with prominent convexity ventral to the acromion process on the lateral surface; reduced calcaneum obscured from anteriorview by the expanded astragalus; distal tarsal IV with proximal projection on the lateral margin; anterior caudal vertebrae composed of opisthocoelous, amphicoelous and procoelous; pleurocoels present on most caudal vertebrae; anterior caudal vertebrae centrum with a pair of vertically arranged pneumatic openings on the lateral surface; bowed humerus with a prominent, spherical top and a curved delto-pectoral crest; proximal section of the humerus with a centrally constricted thick ridge running along the posterior margin; sub-circular, concave proximal articular surface present in the straight ulna; metatarsal III with ginglymoid distal end; constricted proximal articular surface and two lateral splines present in the pedal unguals; radius featuring a sub-spherical distal end; convex medial margin of the proximal end and a medial condyle three times elongated and extending further more distally than the lateral one on the distal end of the metacarpal I; prominent dorso-lateral process on the proximal end and a longitudinal spline on the ventral margin of the proximal third of the end in the metacarpal II; narrow spline-medial to the trochanteric head extending down to the posterior margin of the femoral end, and a patellar spline present on the anterior surface of the distal end; manual unguals with triangular lateral splines; pubis laterally compressed; femur with straight end; neck tightened between the postero-medially oriented spherical femoral top and the anteroposteriorly expanded trochanteric crest that is more stocky and higher anteriorly than posteriorly. Classification In 2007, Xu et al. assigned Gigantoraptor to the Oviraptoridae, in a basal position. The anatomy of Gigantoraptor includes the diagnostic features of the Oviraptorosaurs. However, it also includes several features found in more derived eumaniraptoran dinosaurs, such as a forelimb/hindlimb ratio of 60%, a lack of expansion of the distal scapula and the lack of a fourth trochanter on the femur. Despite its size, Gigantoraptor would thus have been more bird-like than its smaller oviraptorosaurian relatives. In 2010, a second analysis of Gigantoraptor relationships found it to be a member of the Caenagnathidae rather than an oviraptorid. Phylogenetic analysis conducted by Lamanna et al. (2014), supported that Gigantoraptor was a basal caenagnathid. Comparison between the manus of Gigantoraptor and other caenagnathoids The cladogram below follows the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Funston & Currie in 2016, which found Gigantoraptor to be a Caenagnathid. Paleobiology Embryo nicknamed \\"Baby Louie\\", belonging to the related genus Beibeilong, Children's Museum of Indianapolis The diet of Gigantoraptor is uncertain. Although some oviraptorosaurs, such as Caudipteryx and Incisivosaurus, are thought to have been mostly herbivorous, because Gigantoraptor has a small head and long neck like many herbivores. Gigantoraptor had long hind legs with proportions that allowed for fast movement (it was probably more nimble than the heavier and less agile Tarbosaurus), and large claws, a combination that is not usually found in herbivores of this size. Paul suggested that Gigantoraptor was also a herbivore and used its speed to escape predators. The preserved jaw for Gigantoraptor also indicates that the theropod had a shearing bite, possibly for cutting through plants (and potentially meat). This is comparable to other caenagnathids and contrasting with the jaws of oviraptorids, whose jaws seem better suited for crushing food. The specimen has advanced ossification and growth rings in the fibula that indicate it was likely 11 years old when it died. It appears to have reached an early young adult stage at age seven, and probably would have grown much larger when it reached the adult stage. This indicates a growth rate that is faster than in most large non-avian theropods. The existence of giant oviraptorosaurians, such as Gigantoraptor, explains several earlier Asian finds of very large, up to 53 centimetres long, oviraptorosaurian eggs, assigned to the oospecies Macroelongatoolithus carlylensis. These were laid in enormous rings with a diameter of three metres. The presence of Macroelongatoolithus in North America indicates that gigantic oviraptorosaurs were present there as well, though no fossil skeletal remains have been found. Paleoecology Restoration of two Gigantoraptors protecting their nest from two Archaeornithomimus and an Alectrosaurus Gigantoraptor was unearthed from the Iren Dabasu Formation, with an existence about 95.8 ¬± 6.2 million years ago. During the times of the Late Cretaceous, in this area existed a large braided river valley with floodplain and fluvial environments. These environments had extensive vegetation, evidenced in the palaeosol development and the numerous herbivorous dinosaurs remains that were found in both the river channel and the floodplain sediments. Here, it lived alongside diverse dinosaurian fauna, compromising other theropods: Alectrosaurus, Archaeornithomimus, Caenagnathasia, Erliansaurus and Neimongosaurus; the sauropod Sonidosaurus, and hadrosauroids Bactrosaurus and Gilmoreosaurus.

It is assigned to the Twenty-Second Air Force of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and is stationed at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia. When mobilized, most of the wing would be assigned to Air Mobility Command, while a smaller proportion would be retained by AFRC. The 94th Wing is the host organization at Dobbins ARB and is responsible for providing security, civil engineering, fire protection, air traffic control, airfield maintenance, and numerous other services the base and to tenant organizations assigned to the base. History : For related history, see 94th Operations Group Bombardment and reconnaissance operations First activated in June 1949 at Marietta Air Force Base as the 94th Bombardment Wing, the wing trained in the reserve as a light bomber wing until March 1951, when it was called to active service on 10 March 1951 during the Korean War. By 20 March all wing personnel had been transferred to other USAF organizations and the wing was inactivated on 1 April. The wing's aircraft were also distributed to other organizations Cantwell, p. 137 The wing was reactivated in the reserves in June 1952 at what was now called Dobbins Air Force BaseMueller, p. 105 as the 94th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, replacing the 902d Reserve Training Wing. The reserve mobilization for the Korean war had left the reserve without aircraft, and the unit did not receive aircraft until July. Once it received aircraft, it began to train for the reconnaissance mission with a variety of aircraft.Cantwell, p. 139 The Air Force desired that all reserve units be designed to augment the regular forces in the event of a national emergency. The reserves, however, had six pilot training wings with no mobilization mission. On 18 May 1955, they were discontinued.Cantwell, p. 146 In the resulting reorganization of reserve wings, the 94th Wing transferred its mission, personnel and equipment at Dobbins to the 482d Fighter-Bomber Wing and moved on paper to Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, where it absorbed the resources of the 8711th Pilot Training Wing and returned to its original role as a light bombardment unit.Mueller, p. 518 Airlift operations It flew its Douglas B-26 Invaders for only two years at Scott. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were pressuring the Air Force to provide more wartime airlift. At the same time, about 150 Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars became available from the active force. Consequently, in November 1956 the Air Force directed Continental Air Command to convert three reserve fighter bomber wings to the troop carrier mission by 1957. Cuts in the budget in 1957 also led to a reduction in the number of reserve wings from 24 to 15.Cantwell, pp. 168-169 As a result, reserve flying operations at Scott were reduced to a single squadron (the 73d Troop Carrier Squadron), and the wing moved on paper to Laurence G. Hanscom Field, Massachusetts in November 1957. On arrival at Hanscom, it absorbed the resources of the inactivating 89th Fighter-Bomber Wing and began conversion to Flying Boxcars. By 1958, wing personnel began taking part in regular airlift missions and exercises, both in the United States and overseas In April 1959, the wing reorganized under the Dual Deputy system. Its 94th Troop Carrier Group was inactivated and the 731st and 732d Troop Carrier Squadrons were assigned directly to the wing. Although the 731st was located with the wing at Hanscom,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 407 the 732d was stationed at Grenier Field, New HampshireMaurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 409 under he Detached Squadron Concept, a program designed to lessen community impact and facilitate recruiting and manning by locating reserve squadron sized units in smaller population centers, rather than concentrating an entire wing in one location.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 Activation of groups under the wing Although the dispersal of flying units was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 To resolve this, at the start of 1962, Continental Air Command determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization, which included the 94th Wing, occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the units being released on 22 November 1962. The formation of troop carrier groups was delayed until February for wings that had been mobilized.Cantwell, pp. 189-191 The wing also participated in contingency operations in the Dominican Republic in 1965. The 902d Group at Grenier was inactivated in January 1966, when the station was turned over to the New Hampshire Air National Guard, but was replaced by the 905th Troop Carrier Group, which had recently moved to Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, in July. The wing's two groups converted to Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs that year, and traded the \\"troop carrier\\" in their names for \\"military airlift\\" as the wing became the 94th Military Airlift Wing. The wing flew strategic airlift including troop and cargo-carrying missions to Southeast Asia until 1971, augmenting the airlift resources of Military Airlift Command and Tactical Air Command. In February 1972, the 905th Group was reassigned to the 459th Military Airlift Wing, leaving the wing with only a single group. In July, it moved back to its original base at Dobbins and became the 94th Tactical Airlift Wing. It was assigned the 908th and 918th Tactical Airlift Groups, flying the de Havilland Canada C-7 Caribou. The wing's primary operations now involved support of Army airborne forces, tactical cargo airlift, and air evacuation missions. From July 1973 to May 1975, the wing flew missions in Puerto Rico, airdropping 1.2 billion sterile screwworm flies as part of a project to eradicate the screwworm menace to Puerto Rico's livestock. It controlled the 907th Tactical Airlift Group with an aerial spraying mission between 1981 and 1989. In 1981, the 94th became the second largest wing in the Air Force Reserve, flying three different types of transport aircraft. By 1987, it had given up C-7 and C-123 aircraft, retaining only C-130s. In 1990-1991, wing personnel transported passengers and materiel between the United States and Southwest Asia. Elements of the wing rotated regularly to Panama during the 1980s and 1990s. The wing participated in numerous humanitarian airlift and contingency operations worldwide, especially in the areas of Southwest Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean Sea. In the spring of 1996, wing personnel and aircraft deployed to Europe in support of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. Recent operations have been the Haiti invasion preparations; deployment to Ramstein Air Base, Germany for Bosnian airlift support; Somalian aeromedical evacuation; air logistic support from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey; and preparations of hurricane relief supplies. In addition. Until its closure in 1999, the wing also routinely rotated aircraft/crews to the former Howard Air Force Base, Panama, for Latin and South American logistic support, a mission that has since shifted to Mu√±iz Air National Guard Base, Puerto Rico. On nearly a daily basis, unit personnel fly airlift missions throughout the United States and overseas. Mission and units in the late 2010s The 94th Wing is organized into a headquarters element, an operations group, maintenance group and mission support group, and a medical element. In total, the wing comprises 14 squadrons and 1 flight of over 1,600 personnel. The primary mission of the wing is to maintain combat ready Lockheed C-130H Hercules aircraft to deploy on short notice to support contingencies. The secondary mission is as host organization for supporting all agencies and tenants at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. To accomplish this, the wing recruits, organizes, and trains Air Force reservists for active duty in time of war, national emergency, or contingency tasking employing the to deliver cargo and personnel into and out of airports as minimal as austere dirt runways to major international airports. As the Dobbins ARB host organization, the 94 AW supports more than 10,000 national guardsmen, reservists and civilians from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines‚Äîall tenant commands at Dobbins ARB. The 94 AW is responsible for providing security, civil engineering, fire protection, air traffic control, and numerous other services for the base and to tenant organizations assigned to the base. This includes the maintenance of the airfield, which is also used by Army Aviation elements of the Georgia Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve, Lockheed-Martin/Air Force Plant #6, and other Dobbins tenants. The 94th Operations Group is responsible for aerial delivery operations, aeromedical evacuation, operations support and flying squadron activities, a deployable airlift control flight, airfield management, base weather, and air traffic control. The mission involves tactical combat airland and airdrop of personnel and equipment and forward deployed austere operational command and control of airlift support forces. Its units can deploy anywhere in the world in the event of heightened tension, outbreak of hostilities or to support humanitarian mission as dictated by the National Command Authority. Group subordinate units are: :: 700th Airlift Squadron :: 94th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron :: 94th Operations Support Squadron The 94th Maintenance Group includes military and civilian members providing logistics support and maintenance for the wing‚Äôs fleet of C-130H aircraft.

Sprague de Camp, Twayne Publishers, 1953 The Viagens Interplanetarias series is a sequence of science fiction stories by L. Sprague de Camp, begun in the late 1940s and written under the influence of contemporary space opera and sword and planet stories, particularly Edgar Rice Burroughs's Martian novels. Set in the future in the 21st and 22nd centuries, the series is named for the quasi-public Terran agency portrayed as monopolizing interstellar travel, the Brazilian- dominated Viagens Interplanetarias (\\"Interplanetary Voyages\\" or \\"Interplanetary Tours\\" in Portuguese). It is also known as the Krishna series, as the majority of the stories belong to a sequence set on a fictional planet of that name. While de Camp started out as a science fiction writer and his early reputation was based on his short stories in the genre, the Viagens tales represent his only extended science fiction series. The Viagens stories were written in two phases; the first, written between 1948 and 1953 and published between 1949 and 1958, was a burst of activity that produced the first four Krishna novels and most of the non-Krishna pieces, including all the short stories. The second, produced at a more deliberate pace from 1977‚Äì1992, comprised the remaining four Krishna novels and the two novels of the Kukulkan sequence. The early works established the setting of a cosmopolitan future interstellar civilization comprising both Terrans and a handful of other space-faring races who trade and squabble with each other while attempting to maintain a benign stewardship of the more primitive planetary societies with which they come into contact. The later works assumed but largely ignored this background, concentrating exclusively on the adventures of Terrans on the alien worlds of Krishna and Kukulkan. The setting The Viagens universe is not a picturesque backdrop for heroics, like those of de Camp's predecessors Edgar Rice Burroughs and E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith, nor is it a carefully constructed and recounted future history like those of contemporaries Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Poul Anderson. Most of the stories take place in the 22nd century, after an initial period of exploration and diplomacy establishing the ground rules for interstellar commerce and contact, but before the higher civilization of the space-faring cultures has completely transformed those of the more primitive, planet-bound races. Given de Camp's view of even the most intelligent of beings as subject to the dictates of their instincts, emotions and self-interest, the Viagens universe represents a workable but decidedly imperfect future. Just as de Camp attempted to do in the fantasy genre with his Pusadian stories for the Hyborian Age tales of Robert E. Howard, the Viagens tales represent both a tribute to contemporary space opera and sword and planet fiction and an attempt to \\"get them right\\", reconstructing the premises logically, without what he regarded as their technological, biological and anthropological absurdities. De Camp intended the stories as \\"pure entertainment in the form of light, humorous, swashbuckling, interplanetary adventure-romances - a sort of sophisticated Burroughs-type story, more carefully thought out than their prototypes.\\"De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, Dec. 1959, page 3.) Thus he discarded such impossible but commonplace notions such as interfertility of human beings with humanoid alien races, civilizations possessing flying machines but no ground transport, bladed weapons and advanced gunnery coexisting in the same society, and faster than light travel. De Camp did, however, underestimate the staggering impediments to even sub-light interstellar travel, assuming it would both be achieved quickly and soon develop into a relatively routine and comfortable system of commerce and travel linking nearby star-systems, much as sailing ships linked the early modern nations of Earth. He also assumed the parallel and convergent evolution of life on other worlds into types of higher multicellular lifeforms similar to those of Earth, and the ubiquity of intelligent life; thus his alien planets have both animal and plant life, with at least one species of animal life usually having achieved intelligence, and these alien intelligent species are in the main recognizably mammalian or reptilian. The constraints adopted have definite implications on the stories told. An Earthman may fall in love with and wed an alien princess like Burroughs' John Carter of Mars does, but unlike Carter will never be able to found a dynasty. Nor will he be able to flit from Earth to the stars and back; an interstellar voyage takes months of subjective time and many years in objective time - as dictated by the time dilation of the Theory of relativity - rendering any decision to leave his own stellar system a difficult one, fraught with the consequences of being cut off from his friends, family and native culture for decades, during which they will age or develop much more than he will himself. De Camp somewhat mitigates the problem by postulating the development of longevity treatments that extend human lifespans to two centuries. Nonetheless, the effect is that space travel primarily attracts marginal and unattached members of society such as adventurers, entrepreneurs, con-men, utopian idealists, emigrants, and various admixtures thereof ‚Äì or official representatives such as explorers, diplomats, and bureaucrats. Sterling, selfless heroes are in short supply. The relative isolation of each star system from the others effectively precludes interstellar warfare, and the practical limitation of even extended lifespans limits the area of effective routine contact to nearby star systems. Within this region an Interplanetary Council regulates relations between the various civilizations. Star systems and planets The main planets hosting intelligent life and their stars are Earth and Mars (Sol), Osiris, Isis and Thoth (Procyon), Krishna and Vishnu (Tau Ceti), Ormazd (Lalande 21185), and Kukulkan (Epsilon Eridani). These are the Terran designations; the local ones are rarely revealed. All are named for Terran gods because de Camp assumes that Terrans will have carried their penchant for naming planets after deities to other star systems, with each planetary system being named for a different pantheon ‚Äì Egyptian for Procyon, Hindu for Tau Ceti, Persian for Lalande 21185, and Mesoamerican for Epsilon Eridani. (There is some confusion regarding the last of these; in addition to Kukulkan, another planet, Thor, is also stated to be a planet of Epsilon Eridani, though Thor belongs to a different pantheon from Kukulkan.) Some other planets are also occasionally mentioned in the series, and their inhabitants sometimes seen. Terrans and the dinosaur-like natives of the planet Osiris are the main space-faring peoples; a third, the small, furry and bisexual natives of Thoth, a neighboring planet to Osiris, is dependent on Osirian technology. Pre-technological races include the humanoid inhabitants of Krishna and Ormazd, the ape-like and centaur-like inhabitants of Vishnu, and the multi-legged inhabitants of Thor. The dinosauroids of Kukulkan have steam-based technology. Earth has Brazil as the most powerful nation after World War III greatly weakened the United States and destroyed the Soviet Union. Terran space travel is monopolized by the Brazilian-dominated Viagens Interplanetarias government agency. The planet is overpopulated and governed by a World Federation; Terrans have colonized Thor and Kukulkan, straining relations with the native inhabitants, and are responsible for maintaining a technological embargo against the primitive planets of Krishna and Vishnu in the Tau Ceti system. Ganesha, in the same star system as Krishna, is occasionally described as inhabited, but its natives are otherwise never mentioned, and it is never visited in the series. In the short story \\"The Colorful Character,\\" it is stated that no complete biological survey has ever been made of the planet. Isis, in the same star system as Osiris, is inhabited by a trunked and multi-legged species described as resembling a cross between an elephant and a dachshund. Isidians are only occasionally encountered in the series. Krishna, the setting for most of the stories, is a world similar to Earth, though its humanoid natives tend to be more impulsive and volatile. Their planet is drier than Earth, having no ocean or continents as such, but rather a worldwide landmass dotted with numerous seas and lakes. As a result, much of its area is composed of broad desert and steppe regions inhabited by nomads who periodically overwhelm and destroy the civilizations of the better- watered and more settled regions. Thus Krishnan civilization, while older than that of Earth by tens of thousands of years, has never progressed to a technological stage, having been forced to continually rebuild itself in the wake of repeated disasters. In the region of the Triple Seas, the planet's largest drainage area and the setting of all but one of the Krishna stories, the most recent disaster occurred over a thousand years prior to the contact era, when the Kalwmian Empire was destroyed and partially overrun by the Varastou people. At the time of the stories the Varastou nations themselves are similarly threatened by the nomads of Qaath. The presence of the Terrans with their superior technology complicates the situation. Despite the much- resented technological blockade, the local nations are beginning to develop their own technology after the Terran example, even as Terran culture undermines its customs and institutions. For instance, a railway network is slowly spreading around the Triple Seas, though the trains are pulled by elephantine local beasts rather than powered engines. The premier example of Krishnan adaptation is the island nation of Sotasp√©, whose prince has established a patent system to encourage innovation. Kukulkan is resource- poor, which along with the innate conservatism of its dinosauroid inhabitants inhibits its venerably ancient civilization from developing technologically. The natives do make limited use of steam power. It is partial colonized by Terrans, and there is periodic friction between the native states and Terran colonies. Mars is a dry world with a thin atmosphere whose inhabitants, described as short and insect-like, are mentioned but not seen in the stories. Ormazd is a world whose humanoid natives' unique biological traits have encouraged the development of hive societies similar to those of the social insects of Earth. Each is centered around a single ruling queen who alone can bear young, with a handful of males forming her harem and a host of sterile workers who make up the bulk of the population and perform all other societal roles. Contact with Terrans disrupts this system and leads to its overthrow. Osiris is an arid world whose dinosauroid inhabitants are characterized as both sentimental and rapaciously capitalistic; they are also possessed of mind-controlling powers, generally referred to as \\"telepathic pseudohypnosis,\\" against which other intelligent species must take special precautions. Thor is another world subject to partial Terran colonization, which its bird-like natives resent and contest. Thoth, in the same star system as Osiris, is a wet planet whose small, furry and bisexual natives are amoral and anarchic. Vishnu, in the same star system as Krishna, is lush, tropical, and populated by two different intelligent species, both barbaric primitives in culture; the ape-like Romeli and the centaur-like Dzlieri. Stories The Viagens tales have never been published together as a complete set. The shorter pieces were initially published in several science fiction magazines in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and first appeared in book form in the 1953 collections The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens and Sprague de Camp's New Anthology of Science Fiction (which also includes non-Viagens stories). The novels were issued at various times by various publishers; Ace Books brought out a standard edition of the first five Krishna novels in the early 1980s, later adding the sixth and seventh; the eighth, never part of this edition, was issued later by Baen Books. De Camp's early short stories in the Viagens setting are mostly stand-alone tales. They establish the background, provide some hints of his future's back history, and give glimpses of the routine of interstellar space travel, typical characters engaging in it, and some of the intelligent alien races, and the worlds they inhabit. The longer tales are all adventures taking place on the planets themselves, with few passages set aboard spacecraft. They consist of a couple stand-alones set on Earth and Ormazd and two sequences of novels set on Krishna and Kukulkan. Stand-alone tales The stand-alone stories are typically set on spaceships traveling between star systems and on individual planets such as Earth, Vishnu and Osiris. *\\"The Inspector's Teeth\\" (1950 short story - takes place on Earth in 2054 and 2088), chronologically the earliest in the fictional history, relates how the Interplanetary Council regulating relations between the various stellar systems is established, and, in flashback, the adventures of Hithafea, a young Osirian, as a fraternity pledge at Earth's Atlantic University. *\\"Summer Wear\\" (1950 short story - takes place on Earth, in space, and on Osiris in 2104-2128) concerns a commercial space voyage from Earth to Osiris and back, in which clothing salesman Cato Chapman and the representative of a rival firm try to sell the nudist Osirians on Earth fashion. They return to discover that in their absence their industry has collapsed, Osirians having sold Terrans on Osirian body paint. *\\"The Colorful Character\\" (1949 short story - takes place on Earth in 2117), another early tale, tells how biologist Gregory Lawrence helps thwart a plot by a Krishnan adventurer to kidnap Earth scientists and break the technological blockade of that primitive planet. The Krishnan events alluded to in this story antedate those of all the Krishnan tales. *\\"The Galton Whistle\\" (1951 short story - takes place on Vishnu in 2117), in which surveyor Adrian Frome foils a madman's attempt to establish a personal empire among the primitive Dzlieri centauroids. *\\"The Animal-Cracker Plot\\" (1949 short story - takes place on Vishnu in 2120) relates how customs agent Luther Beck defuses a potential war between the native Dzlieri and Romeli tribes fomented by the profiteering of con man Darius Koshay. *\\"Git Along!\\" (1950 short story - takes place on Osiris in 2135-2148) tells of Darius Koshay's scheme to establish a dude ranch on Osiris, and how the enterprise miscarries. *\\"The Continent Makers\\" (1951 novella - takes place on Earth in 2153), in which geophysicist Gordon Graham helps defeat a Thothian conspiracy to plant a colony on Earth, has the most extended vision of de Camp's future Earth and its dominant power, Brazil. The presence of two Krishnan expatriates dates this story after the establishment of diplomatic relations between Earth and the Krishnan island nation of Sotaspe resulting from the events of \\"Finished.\\" *Rogue Queen (1951 novel - takes place on Ormazd - date of action not established) tells of the second contact of the interstellar civilization with the newly discovered planet Ormazd from the point of view of native humanoid Iroedh, showing how her hive society is inadvertently but inevitably undermined and transformed by the advent of the Terrans. This, de Camp's most influential Viagens novel, was one of the earliest science fiction novels to deal with sexual themes. Krishna tales The seven novels and four short stories of the Krishna sequence follow various Earthmen and occasional other aliens in their encounters with the pretechnical local culture, in which their pursuit of their own often petty ends tend to have ramifications ranging from minor to history-changing on a society struggling to adapt to the more advanced civilization. The novels were written in two phases, the first four in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and the last four from the late 1970s through the early 1990s. The earlier series features different protagonists, and are unified primarily by their common setting and a number of recurring secondary characters, generally Viagens officials based at the Terran spaceport of Novorecife, but also a few important native Krishans. The later Krishna novels, some of which de Camp wrote in collaboration with his wife Catherine Crook de Camp, are interwoven with the earlier sequence chronologically. They concentrate primarily on two recurring protagonists, Terran tour guide Fergus Reith and his on-again, off- again lover, anthropologist Alicia Dyckman, usually relegating both major and minor returning characters from the previous sequence to secondary roles. The titles of all of de Camp's Krishna novels and one of the novellas include a name beginning with \\"Z\\", a practice he claimed to have devised to keep track of them. He did not follow the practice for short stories set on Krishna. *\\"Finished\\" (1949 short story - takes place in 2114 and 2140) unravels the scheme of Krishnan prince Ferrian of Sotaspe to smuggle Terran technical literature to Krishna, which fails of its specific end but succeeds in importing concepts that will inevitably promote Krishnan progress. *\\"Perpetual Motion\\" (1950 novella - takes place in 2137) unveils the scheme of con-man Felix Borel to bilk the knight-rulers of a Krishnan republic by means of a rigged lottery and a phony perpetual motion machine. *The Queen of Zamba (1949 novel - takes place in 2138) tells of how Canadian private investigator Victor Hasselborg trails a tycoon's daughter after she leaves Earth for Krishna in the company of English adventurer Anthony Fallon. *\\"Calories\\" (1951 short story - takes place about 2139) details the escape of Earthmen Cuthwin Singer and Earl Okagamut from the fanatical theocrats of Nichnyamadze through the latter's knowledge of physiology. *The Hand of Zei (1950 novel - takes place in 2132, 2143 and 2144) shows the adventures of copy-writer Dirk Barneveldt, would-be rescuer of a kidnapped explorer, as he finds he must clean out a nest of pirates, break up a drug trade that threatens Earth, and overthrow a matriarchy in order to achieve his goal. *The Hostage of Zir (1977 novel - takes place about 2148) introduces tour guide Fergus Reith as an inexperienced, misfortune-plagued tyro leading his first tour of Krishna and inadvertently becoming entangled in Krishnan politics, first in a power- struggle between the bandit ruler and the religious leader of the restive province of Zir and afterwards in the machinations of the devious regent of the kingdom of Dur. *The Prisoner of Zhamanak (1982 novel - takes place about 2149) relates the quest of Terran consul Percy Mjipa (first introduced in previously published but chronologically later The Tower of Zanid) to free the trouble-prone Alicia Dyckman from captivity in the hostile native kingdom of Zhamanak; Dyckman meets and becomes involved with Reith at the end of the story. *\\"The Virgin of Zesh\\" (1953 novella - takes place in 2150) follows the flight of missionary Althea Merrick from an unwanted marriage to a colony of utopian expatriates, where she becomes embroiled in the affairs of some peculiarly intelligent aborigines. *The Bones of Zora (1983 novel - takes place in 2151) reunites Fergus Reith and Alicia Dyckman, divorced after a disastrous marriage, as they find themselves assisting rival palaeontologists attempting to prove competing theories regarding the evolutionary past of Krishna. *The Tower of Zanid (1958 novel - takes place in 2168) returns the spotlight to Anthony Fallon as he investigates the disappearance of a number of Terran scientists, helps an archaeologist penetrate the secrets of an ancient temple, and juggles dual roles as a member of the local civic guard and spy for the enemy horde of Qaathian nomads, all the while scheming to recover his lost throne. The book is notable for its favorable portrayal of an African character, omnicompetent Terran consul Percy Mjipa, at a time when most science fiction still depicted such characters rarely and stereotypically. *The Swords of Zinjaban (1991 novel - takes place about 2171) again reunites Fergus Reith and Alicia Dyckman as liaisons for a Terran company hoping to film the first movie on the planet, first as guides helping the advance party scout locations, and then as advisers to the actual production. Complications turn up in the form of several of Reith's old flames and an invasion of the nomadic hordes of Qaath. Kukulkan tales Like the Krishna tales, the two books of the late Kukulkan sequence focus on the adventures of Terrans on a relatively primitive alien world, in this instance a somewhat more advanced planet ruled by a species of dinosaur-like creatures superficially similar to the Osirians. Earth has colonies on Kukulkan, leading to inevitable friction with the native inhabitants, and the protagonists must deal with threats from both cultures. *The Stones of Nomuru (1988 novel - date of action not established) pits archaeologist Keith Salazar in defence of his dig against both the development plans of an avaricious fellow colonist and invasion by a Kukulkanian warlord. *The Venom Trees of Sunga (1992 novel - date of action not established), set a generation later, follows Keith's son, biologist Kirk Salazar as he studies a local species and seeks to protect its habitat amid a struggle between a logging magnate and Terran cultists. Importance in the history of science fiction The Viagens series is notable in the development of American science fiction of the 1950s for bringing a more realistic attitude to bear on some of the less credible features then commonplace to the genre, reimagining them in terms of the possible. It also leavened the hero-worship, sexism, prudery, ethnocentricity and nationalism then characteristic of the genre with a more skeptical view of human nature, strong characters of both genders (and of both same-sex and opposite-sex inclinations, though the latter predominate), for whom sex was a normal aspect of life, and an ethnically varied, international cast. De Camp's work helped prepare the field for the works of later, more iconoclastic writers, to the degree that when he returned to the series in the 1970s his own innovations had themselves come to appear routine and commonplace. Rogue Queen in particular is important in the history of science fiction for breaking the genre's taboo on sexual themes, paving the way for more daring works by Philip Jos√© Farmer and others. Steven Silver speculated that \\"without Rogue Queen to lay the groundwork, it is possible that the anthropological science fiction of a later age, as well as its gender examinations, would not have occur[r]ed in the manner it did.\\"\\"Steven Silver's Reviews: Rogue Queen,\\" The SF Site: The Best in Science Fiction and Fantasy, February 1997. Additionally, Colleen Power has pointed out that \\"the overwhelming concern ... to prevent modern technological humans from influencing or interfering with the normal development of native cultures\\" in the Viagens novels \\"predat[es] 'Star Trek's' 'prime directive' by nearly twenty years.\\"\\"DeCamp, L. (Lyon) Sprague,\\" Reader's Guide to Twentieth-Century Science Fiction, 1989, pp. 173-174. Reception Critical response to the series has been mixed. Commenting on The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens, P. Schuyler Miller wrote \\"Here you will find entertainment, ideas skillfully played with, precise care for detail and consistency, but actually not too much plot-suspense. So logical is the development of most of the stories, that the experienced reader knows what must be coming next.\\" Of the setting, he observed that it allowed \\"ample room for swashbuckling, skullduggery and horseplay, in which de Camp deals deftly from time to time,\\" but noted that \\"[o]ut of this setting, on the other hand, has come just one really memorable book--'Rogue Queen.'\\"\\"The Reference Library,\\" Astounding Science-Fiction, November 1953, p. 150-152. In other reviews of the same collection, Mark Reinsberg wrote that \\"De Camp's style is adroit and witty as he develops science-fiction take-offs on themes like sea piracy, head hunters, the wild west, and jousting knight-hood,\\" and noted that \\"[t]he tales are spiced with glamorous other worldly women.\\"\\"It's 21st Century and Brazil Rules Stellar World,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, July 26, 1953, p. B5. He also rated it \\"[p]robably the most entertaining collection of 'tomorrow tales' by an individual author\\" published in 1953, whose \\"yarns kept the reader laughing over space pioneering in the 22d century and a marvelous pair of interstellar swindlers named Koshay and Borel.\\"\\"Exciting Year for Futuristic, Fantastic,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, December 6, 1953, p. 136 The English Journal stated that \\"[f]or fantasy, irony, and imagination these stories are remarkable.\\"\\"New Books,\\" The English Journal, April 1953, p. 226. The Los Angeles Times noted that in postulating the rise of Brazil as a world power, de Camp \\"develops an interesting and not too improbable theme.\\"\\"Storytellers Deal With Instruments of Future World,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 31, 1953, p. D6. On the other hand, Boucher and McComas felt \\"the stories of the Viagens Interplanetarias have usually struck us as pretty routine work unworthy of L. Sprague de Camp, but devotees of the series will welcome the collected volume.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, May 1953, p. 89. Groff Conklin assessed it as a \\"cream-puff- light book of space opera ... [f]ine stuff for bedtime, but I do feel that the stories were written with the left hind paw of an immensely brilliant fellow who just wasn't trying hard. Perhaps we should call it 'relentlessly light reading!'\\" Early reviewers of the first Krishna novel, The Queen of Zamba, were mixedly impressed by the book. J. Francis McComas called it \\"a tedious account of a private eye's quest through space for a runaway heiress,\\" with \\"[t]he chase ... a pretty drab affair, without the wit and charm usually found in this author's work.\\"\\"Spaceman's Realm,\\" New York Times, July 11, 1954, p. BR19. Groff Conklin characterized it as \\"a cops-and-robbers adventure,\\" rating it \\"fast-moving and moderately sophisticated entertainment, bubble-light through not bubble-headed, and considerably below the author's best.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf,\\" Galaxy Science Fiction, November 1954, pp. 121-122. Anthony Boucher described the novel as \\"a fairly primitive and predictable adventure story which is 'science fiction' because it is said to happen on the remote planet Krishna.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, September 1954, p.93. Later critics struck much the same note. William Mattathias Robins called it \\"a simple detective adventure in an exotic setting.\\"\\"L. Sprague de Camp,\\" Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science-Fiction Writers, Part 1:A-L, 1981, p. 117. Colleen Power wrote more charitably that \\"[w]hile the novel seems dated, with its tough-talking detective slang and philosophy, [its] satire combines nicely with comic swordplay to present the reader with a short, light science fiction detective novel.\\" David Pringle characterized it as \\"[l]ight-hearted planetary romance -- or fantasy in an ostensibly science fictional setting.\\"\\"Cosmic Manhunt (1954),\\" The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction: an A-Z of Science Fiction Books by Title, 2d. ed., 1995, p.79. Both Boucher and Robins note the novel's primacy in the Viagens series, suggesting they see its primary significance in the establishment of the setting. Reviews of Rogue Queen were largely positive. Anthony Boucher praised de Camp for \\"producing a science-fiction narrative which is entirely about sex, and, surprisingly, non-pornographic,\\" characterizing the narrative as \\"that rarest of collector's items: a completely new science-fiction plot.\\"\\"Spacemen's Realm\\", The New York Times, July 29, 1951, p. 160. Later he and J. Francis McComas rated Rogue Queen as \\"[t]he most interesting recent fictional extrapolation,\\" noting that \\"[l]ively and unusual thinking, a vigorous plot, and a most appealing non-human heroine make [it] the best de Camp novel in many years.\\".\\"Recommended Reading,\\" The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, December 1951, p. 87 Groff Conklin described the novel as \\"without doubt the best item de Camp has yet developed out of his concept of Viagens Interplanetarias\\", lauding \\"[t]he meticulously scientific way in which de Camp develops details of this culture on a far- distant planet to parallel a bee society [as] fascinating,\\" with \\"[t]he story of how this is accomplished ... made so circumstantially real, so humanly plausible, that the book becomes a sheer delight to read.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf,\\" Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1951, pp. 87-88. P. Schuyler Miller also called the novel the series's \\"most handsome dividend,\\" finding it \\"by long odds the best of the Viagens stories, worked out with the de Campian flair for meticulously ridiculous logic.\\"\\"The Reference Library\\", Astounding Science Fiction, November 1951, pp.118=19 The reviewer for Startling Stories characterized the book as \\"another in the same vein\\" in the author's \\"growing list of gentle satires,\\" with \\"[t]he story ... relatively unimportant, ... there only as a vehicle for the author to ride in while he pokes fun at humans and their frailties.\\"\\"Science Fiction Bookshelf,\\" Startling Stories, November 1951, p. 142. Villiers Gerson called it \\"an ingenious, amusing tale\\" in which \\"[t]hat clever science-fiction writer ... for once blended satisfactorily both gimmick and characterization.\\"\\"Spacemen's Realm,\\" The New York Times, January 13, 1952, p. BR22. Commenting on later novels in the series, Lester del Rey in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact wrote of The Hostage of Zir that \\"[t]here's only one way to describe [the book]; it's a new Krishna novel. And like de Camp's other popular Krishna novels, it's a wry and wacky story of a human forced to contend with the semicivilized and semihuman cultures of an alien world where Murphy's law always holds good, and nothing ever goes according to plan. You could call it sword-and-sorcery, since swords are buckled with a touch of swash, and human science is a sort of magic to the too-human but egg-laying Krishnans. But the adventure is always cock-eyed.\\" He concludes that \\"[i]f you've read and enjoyed the other stories of Krishna, you'll want this one. If you haven't read any, this is a good one to start with.\\"Del Rey, Lester. \\"The Reference Library.\\" In Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, v. 98, no. 1, January 1978, p. 173. Don D'Ammassa, addressing it and other late entries in the Viagens series, writes \\"[t]he quality of the series remains undiminished in [these] volumes, which combine good-natured mayhem and a crisp, exciting narrative style.D'Ammassa, Don. \\"de CAMP, L.

He was the father of Johann Christoph Kellner. Biography He was born in Gr√§fenroda, Thuringia, and was intended by his parents to follow his father into a career as a lamp-black merchant. He was devoted to music from childhood, and first learnt singing from the cantor Johann Peter Nagel and keyboard from his son Johann Heinrich Nagel. He studied for a year from 1720 with the organist Johann Schmidt in Zella, followed by a year with the organist Hieronymus Florentius Quehl (or Kehl) in Suhl, during which time he also studied composition. He knew Johann Sebastian Bach well, although it is not known whether he was taught by him. He was also acquainted with George Frideric Handel. In 1722, he returned to work as a tutor at Gr√§fenroda for three years. He was appointed cantor of Frankenhain in October 1725, returning to Gr√§fenroda in December 1727 as assistant cantor. He became cantor after Nagel's death in 1732, and remained in the post for the rest of his life; his pupils included Johann Philipp Kirnberger, Johannes Ringk, and J.E. Rembt. Kellner was admired as an organist, and performed for the Dukes of Coburg and Weimar and the Prince of Sondershausen. He played an important role in the dissemination of music by Johann Sebastian Bach, through the many manuscript copies made by him and his circle, particularly of keyboard and organ works. These are the earliest or only source of many works, and provide information on their chronology, compositional history, and authenticity. Russell Stinson has determined that the three movement trio sonata for organ BWV 1039a/BWV 1027a was not made by Bach, but almost certainly a transcription made by Kellner of the first two movements of Bach's Sonata in G major for two flutes and continuo, BWV 1039, and the fourth movement of Bach's Sonata in G major for viola da gamba and harpsichord, BWV 1027. Compositions His keyboard music is in typical galant style, though also shows influences of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. Published in Arnstadt.

The soap opera was created by Ekta Kapoor and was produced by her production company Balaji Telefilms.Konkona inspires Shubhangi AtreShubhangi‚Äôs baby bluesKaran v/s Shubhangi  Plot summary Kasturi revolves around Kasturi Chawla (Shubhangi Atre Poorey), a young woman from a middle-class family. After graduating from university, she begins working for Robbie Sabharwal (Karan Patel) - a spoilt, arrogant, yet immensely popular rockstar. Robbie and Kasturi take an instant disliking to each other due to the difference in their class, values and morals. Kasturi befriends Robbie's best friend Raunak (Jatin Shah), who seems to respect and understand her beliefs. As Robbie and Kasturi spend more time together, they start to fall in love and eventually confess their feelings. Their relationship is short-lived, as a misunderstanding causes Robbie to believe that Kasturi is cheating on him with Raunak. After Robbie and Kasturi split up, Raunak proposes to Kasturi and she accepts after brief hesitation. On the day of their wedding, Robbie comes to know that he had misunderstood Kasturi and Raunak's relationship. He apologizes and begs Kasturi to reconcile with him, but she denies on the basis that their relationship has no future due to his constant lack of trust in her. Raunak and Kasturi's wedding is followed by a series of events where Robbie tries to sabotage their relationship, but his attempts backfire and bring Raunak and Kasturi even closer. Soon, Raunak dies in an accident and Kasturi starts to believe that Robbie killed him. She sets out to take revenge by marrying him, under the pretext of moving on, and then makes life a living hell for him. Her plan seems to succeed and Robbie ends up in coma. However, Kasturi is shell-shocked when, in Malaysia, she comes face to face with Raunak, who is very much alive. Raunak smugly tells Kasturi how he has been toying with her all along and how he has been the sole cause of her misery. He explains that he had always secretly resented Robbie because he (Robbie) gained fame and popularity while Raunak had not. So when he realized that Robbie/Kasturi broke up, he decided to get even by deliberately marrying Kasturi to hurt Robbie. Then he faked his own death to frame Robbie for murder. The person who helped him engineer this plot turns out to be Robbie's sister Shivani (Mouni Roy). She and Raunak have been in love since childhood, and she loathes Robbie with equal passion. The two of them tell an appalled Kasturi that their next move is to kill Robbie to get their hands on his wealth. Kasturi returns to India, but finds out that Robbie (who has now recovered) detests her for making him suffer for a crime he didn't commit. Eventually, one incident leads to another and Robbie/Kasturi reunite - only to have Raunak re-enter their lives and torture Kasturi on a daily basis, as she's the only one who's aware of his true intentions. A lot of twists and turns follow - Maasi (Robbie's maternal aunt) enters the picture and is revealed to be in cahoots with Raunak. Kasturi is shot, falls off a cliff and loses her mental balance. Robbie lets her stay in his house, but she behaves like a child and can't remember anything about her past. Shortly after that, Raunak's true colours are exposed to everyone and he's sent to prison. However, everyone is still unaware of the fact that Maasi was in cahoots with him. Another accident returns Kasturi to her normal state. Once again, she and Robbie reunite. During the preparations for Robbie and Kasturi's wedding, a middle-aged businessman named Kabir Dhanrajgir (Mohnish Behl) is introduced to the story. Kasturi finds out that a significant portion of Robbie's property has been sold, and that Kabir acted as a catalyst to it. When she begs him to fix the situation, he blackmails her by saying that she would have to marry him for that. On the day of her wedding, she leaves Robbie and marries Kabir. Robbie resorts to drinking and sleeping around to keep his mind off Kasturi. On the other hand, spending time with Kabir makes Kasturi realize that he is a kind-hearted man but doesn't share a good rapport with his two grown up children, who term him as a failed parent. But after that Robbie gets to know that Kabir is not a good person and has killed his 3 wives. Knowing this Robbie tries to get Kasturi out of this mess by telling about Kabir; but Kabir blackmails Robbie that he will kill Kasturi's parents. Kabir dies by falling from a cliff. Kasturi comes to know the truth after his death. Robbie again wants to marry Kasturi but his mom Devika (Sheeba Chaddha) scolds Kasturi for spoiling his life. So Kasturi leaves the house without telling anybody and goes to live with her friend Sanchi. Robbie goes to meet Kasturi and finds out that she went away. He goes back to his mom and tells her that he hates her for separating them. Kasturi starts working in the office of Gayatri Devi (Kamalika Guha Thakurta). There she meets 3 brothers‚ÄîAbhi, Ajay and Adwit‚Äîand solves their problems. Robbie is very sad thinking about Kasturi, when his daddy comes and tell him to start singing again for him. Kasturi's employers want to organize an event and they want Robbbie to start the event. Kasturi is there, too. She gets lost in the memory of her and Robbie's love. When Abhi calls Robbie he says that he has stopped singing. Kasturi is thinking about Robbie and Robbie is thinking about Kasturi. At the end, when Kasturi is about to be married to one of the three brothers, he finds about her and Robbie. Then Robbie and Kasturi marry and all is well.

After several years of testing and modifications, the project was taken over by investors in order to produce fully completed civilian and military training aircraft, but these projects were never realized. Five examples were built; three of these crashed, and the remaining two examples are unflyable. Design and development The genesis of the BD-10 came about after the Bede BD-5 project in the 1970s, when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered Jim Bede into a consent decree, forbidding him from accepting down payments for aircraft for a period of ten years. Bede worked on numerous other projects during this period with preliminary design begun by 1983 on a small jet.Winchester 2005, p. 29. Within weeks of the agreement expiring in 1989, he announced plans for the BD-10JWinchester 2005, p. 29. under the aegis of Bede Jet Corporation, at the Spirit of St. Louis Airport. The BD-5's failure was due largely to the unavailability of a suitable engine; during the BD-5's history one engine company after another either exited the engine business or went bankrupt. Bede started the new design by selecting a suitable commonly available engine and then designing the aircraft around it. The selected engine was the General Electric J85, widely used in a variety of military aircraft and virtually identical to its civilian counterpart, the General Electric CJ-610, available both in new-build and second-hand markets. Perhaps the best known military applications of the J85 are the twin-engined T-38 Talon and the closely related F-5 Freedom Fighter, with the most familiar civilian application being the early Learjet models. The new BD-10J design bore a strong resemblance to the T-38/F-5, although it was much smaller and used only a single engine. The Williams FJ44 and Pratt & Whitney JT12 were also offered as options. The resulting design featured a shoulder-mounted cropped-delta wing with just over of span and a leading-edge sweep of about 30 degrees. Cropped-delta elevators were also used, although featuring a much greater 50 degree leading sweep. The large canopy extended a fair distance above the fuselage midline, in relative terms, so twin rudders were used on either side to provide clean airflow. All of the controls were strictly mechanical, using pushrods. In order to deal with the increasing control stiffness with increased speed, the design initially specified two control sticks, a small side-stick with limited leverage for low speeds, and a full-sized one mounted in front of the seat with much more leverage for high speeds. The aircraft was fairly conventional in construction terms, using aluminum sheeting for the majority of the airframe, and fiberglass for certain parts and fillets. The dry weight was only 1,600 lb (725 kg), about the same as light aircraft like the Cessna 172. Given the engine's nominal thrust at sea level, the design was significantly overpowered, generally considered a major advantage for any aircraft. Performance estimates were extremely exciting; after a takeoff roll of only even at a fully fueled weight of , the aircraft would climb at 20,000 ft/min to a cruising altitude of . At this altitude it would cruise at Mach 0.9 (520 ktas, 595 mph) and at full power would reach Mach 1.4. The high-altitude cruise allowed flights up to 2,000 miles (3,200 km). Prototypes The first prototype, N2BD, was completed in 1991, the first damage occurred before the aircraft was completed. A newly minted A&P; Licensed mechanic didn't follow the specifications for the static landing gear strut. He used thin walled aluminum pipe, which failed to hold the weight of the aircraft. This caused the twin booms to twist and the vertical stabilizers to be canted at different angles. This structural damage was never fixed and wasn't noticed unless looked head-on. The aircraft started testing at Mojave in July 1992.\\"EAA 40th Annual Oshkosh convention\\". Aviation Week and Space Technology, 17 August 1992, p. 56. Early in testing it suffered more minor damage when the gear failed on landing, but the damage was repaired and it returned to flying. However, this aircraft was significantly heavier than originally intended, the empty weight ballooning from the design 1,600 to the prototype's . In order to keep the weight and balance within limits, fuel capacity had to be cut dramatically to 263 gallons, reducing range from the original to 1,500, although it was never to demonstrate anything beyond about . Speed was equally poor; even at full thrust the plane was barely able to reach the transonic, at Mach 0.83. In 1994 N2BD was flown to the Reno Air Races to drum up business. During this flight the skinning on the vertical stabilizers demonstrated some wrinkling, indicating excessive flex. The problem was considered minor, and a stronger tail design was added. Aviation Week and Space Technology published a positive report on the aircraft in its June 1994 edition,\\"BD-10 Flies like Civil 'Fighter'.\\" Aviation Week and Space Technology, 27 June 1994. BD-10 Retrieved: 13 June 2007. although it noted some horizontal \\"snaking\\", not uncommon on an aircraft that is longer than it is wide. By the time Omni Magazine reported on it in its March 1995 issue,\\"Some Assembly Required: this Model Airplane Seats two and is Designed for Mach 1.4.\\" Omni, March 1995. Model Airplane Retrieved: 13 June 2007. the weight was given as , although it is not clear if this represents a real change in weight, or alternately changes in the secondary equipment. On 27 August 1994, the prototype was on a demonstration flight from the factory when the canopy started to open during the takeoff roll. The pilot aborted the takeoff past Vr, and overran the end of the runway while braking. It was later learned that the \\"canopy open\\" indicator light could be extinguished even if the locking lugs were not in place, requiring a minor redesign to prevent this from recurring.NTSB report on the accident involving N2BD Eventually 63 $10,000 deposits (45 in the United StatesWinchester 2005, p. 28.) were placed for the kits. By 1994 three additional airframes were under construction, one by Mike Van Wagenen of Nevada, another by Jim Priebe in Ohio, and the last by Frank Everett in California. However, during this period Chief Test Pilot Skip Holm left the project. Work on the BD-10J project by Bede seems to have stopped at about this point. Continued development The Bede BD-10 in its Peregrine Falcon guise, c. 2005 Van Wagenen had already formed Fox 10 Corporation (or later Fox Aircraft) with the intention of helping kit builders complete their aircraft, by providing hangar space, tools, and guidance. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later ruled this was illegal, although after Van Wagenen had moved on from this concept, rendering the point moot. In December 1993 Van Wagenen took over the entire BD-10 project, intending to produce completed versions of the design under the name Fox-10 and later Peregrine Falcon. Fox Aircraft became the aircraft construction corporation under Peregrine Flight International. In addition to Fox, the group included Point 9 the Peregrine Falcon sales company and Aerospace Safety Technologies, which was developing the Thermion (R) Anti-Icing Technology. In 1994 Fox's first prototype, N9WZ, was completed and entered testing. Although it had been modified to incorporate the stronger tail of Bede's design, it broke up mid-air on 30 December 1994 when the vertical stabilizers failed due to a crossflow condition, killing Van Wagenen. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later concluded that Bede's fix was severely under-designed, and offered nowhere near the strength that had been calculated.NTSB report on the crash of N9WZ Fox had not performed any testing to verify the redesign of the vertical stabilizer spars before continuing flight testing, instead relying upon the data provided by Bede. Peregrine Flight International then renamed the design the PJ-2. It redesigned the horizontal and vertical surfaces for another prototype, N62PJ. This aircraft crashed on 4 August 1995 when one flap failed to retract following a go-around.NTSB report on the crash of N62PJ The resulting accident killed the company president, Joseph Henderson, and Peregrine ceased to exist. In 1996 Bede sold the military rights to Monitor Jet of Canada, which intended to equip it with the Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D engine and sell it as a basic trainer as the MJ-7. Monitor also purchased the single so-far completed kit, N700JP, its pilot apparently not interested in flying it. There appears to have been some interest on the part of the Portuguese Air Force as a replacement for its fleet of Alpha Jets in the training role,\\"Canadian Aerospace Group and Sikorsky Aircraft Team in Portugal Military Bid.\\" 13 December 1999. Portugal Military Bid Retrieved: 13 June 2007. but nothing ever came of this. The aircraft was even mentioned briefly during the Canadian Parliamentary Debates.OFFICIAL REPORT (HANSARD) Wednesday, 24 September 1997 When a group of investors in Bede's company threatened to foreclose, Bede declared bankruptcy in 1997. The investors formed Vortex Aircraft in San Diego intended to produce completed versions as the PhoenixJet for the military market, terminating Monitor's agreement due to a claimed failed payment.Sweeny, Michael. New San Diego Company Acquires BD-10 at Bankruptcy Auction. BD-10 Rights Retrieved: 13 June 2007. Oddly, Monitor purchased the original prototype, N2BD, at the same auction, although for reasons that are unclear it appears it was never moved. Neither company managed to find any interest in the design, and both companies disappeared, the lawsuit being dropped in 1998. This left only the second kit-built aircraft, N7FF, still flying. It broke up in midair off the southern coast of California in 2003 after pilot Frank Everett had radioed a MAYDAY call in which he stated that the aircraft was \\"disintegrating\\". Everett did not survive.NTSB report on the crash of N7FF The original prototype N2BD was hangared in Scottsdale, Arizona, when the company went bankrupt, and now belongs to Fuel Fresh Inc., which operates a number of jet aircraft. Monitor Jet's example remained in Canada, and eventually ended up in the Toronto Aerospace Museum, with its JT-15D engine stored separately.

He was first elected as a municipal councillor and then, as president of the Udupi municipal council in 1968. This was the first ever victory of the Jana Sangh in an urban municipality in South India. The BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani later remarked that the Jana Sangh victory in the Udupi municipal council in 1968 laid foundation for the BJP rule in South India and particularly in the state of Karnataka. As the youngest municipal president of Udupi, he was hailed for his pro-active role in the development of the town. He remained municipal president for a period of 8 years and the Swarna river water supply system, Under ground drainage system, Town roads widening etc.were some of his achievements during this period. Under his presidency Udupi Municipality in 1968 became first in nation to ban carrying night soil by humans. During the Emergency (1975‚Äì77), he was imprisoned for a period of 19 months. After being released, he unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from Udupi in 1977 and 1980. He was elected as a member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly from Udupi constituency in 1983 and was the floor leader of the BJP Legislature party. He was as a Member of the Karnataka Legislative Council from 1996 until his death. In the BJP-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition government headed by H.D.Kumaraswamy, he was Cabinet minister for Medical Education with additional charge of Animal Husbandry. Following the historic victory of the BJP in Karnataka in the 2008 state assembly elections, he was appointed as the Home minister in the Yeddyurappa government. He was considered as the second most important leader of the government after the Chief minister and was also the Leader of the House in the legislative council. As home minister, he was credited with the streamlining of administration and modernising of the police force in the state. Later, he was appointed as the Higher Education minister in 2010. Acharya was one of the most senior leaders of the BJP in Karnataka and as such, played an important role in the growth of the party in the state. He was president of the Dakshina Kannada district unit of the Jana Sangh (1974‚Äì77), Janata Party (1977‚Äì80) and BJP (1980‚Äì83). Also, he played a major role in the formation of the Udupi district in 1998. Known for his honesty, simplicity, dedication, wit and hard work, the soft-spoken Acharya was widely respected in the BJP and across party lines. As a loyal worker of the RSS, he remained committed to the ideology and discipline of the organisation and inspired thousands of BJP workers and leaders.  Death  He died of a heart attack on 14 February 2012. He was participating in a program when he suddenly collapsed. He died on the way to the hospital. The Chief minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda described him as the conscience keeper of the BJP Government. Various other leaders like L.K. Advani and B.S.

At the age of thirteen he arrived, poor and destitute, in Leghorn, where, although he had previously intended to become a mechanic, his agreeable voice induced him to prepare himself to become a cantor. After the death of Adam Bondi, cantor of the Jewish congregation in Leghorn, whose daughter he had married, he became his successor. He then, with indefatigable diligence, devoted himself to the study of the Hebrew and Spanish languages, and to rabbinical science. He was soon advanced to the position of rabbi and preacher, in which capacity he so greatly distinguished himself that even Christian scholars delighted to discuss with him religious and philosophical topics. Castello is probably the Jewish scholar with whom Lessing conversed during his scientific tour in the company of Duke Leopold of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel, and, on hearing whom, the duke is said to have exclaimed in astonishment, \\"Here we have one even greater than Mendelssohn--of far purer metaphysics.\\" His son, Joseph Castello, was a physician in Italy.

Biography Stephen John Pearce was born in 1962 and came from Haverhill. He left school at sixteen with no qualifications and entered a work training placement with sub contracted distribution company distributing Phonogram Records. His mother purchased a mobile disco unit on hire purchase and Stevo began a Monday-night residency at the Chelsea Drugstore in London's King's Road.Marc Almond, Tainted Life, Sidgwick & Jackson Around this time he was banned from playing certain clubs due to his eccentricities. He was chased out of one club for just repeating \\"Yes hello, hello yes, it's highly psychological\\", and after mixing Mickey Mouse into Cabaret Voltaire at half speed. Other things that the public were not used to included playing six different records at the same time, causing a very intense sound. After the residency at the Drugstore, Stevo moved on to working a regular night at the Clarendon Hotel, Hammersmith.Malins, p. 13 The nights at the Clarendon were known as \\"Stevo's Electro Tunes\\" where bands like DAF, Fad Gadget, Last Dance, Naked Lunch and Boyd Rice played.Malins, p. 20 At this time Stevo regarded himself as a music anarchist in the music scene and felt it important for musical barriers to be broken down. After these nights attracted interest Stevo was asked to compile an electronic music chart in the Record Mirror, soon followed by his \\"Futurist Chart\\" in Sounds. He did not like the term \\"Futurist\\", feeling the name was \\"a bit of a joke\\". The Sounds chart was filled with demos that were sent to him by new unknown bands. In 1980, after realising he was receiving some very good material, he decided to put together a compilation album, the Some Bizzare Album. Stevo went on to sign some of the most important underground, alternative bands of the 1980s, becoming notorious in the way he signed bands, especially with major record labels who knew how important the deal was to them. Eccentric record contract signings included Test Department's deal, which was signed on a rocking-horse named Horace. Stevo also was sent sweets every week as part of a deal with Phonogram Records. There is also the famous story of a teddy bear sent to a meeting, to clinch the deal for Soft Cell. The teddy was appropriately dressed as Robin Hood. Associated artists Stevo Pearce has been involved with many artists and bands as their manager or through his label Some Bizzare Records. Soft Cell The Warehouse Leeds, Yorkshire, was where Soft Cell first had a meeting with Stevo, who had hitch-hiked to Leeds from London, picked up at Staple Corner by the band Modern English as he was holding a sign saying \\"Leeds\\". Marc Almond was impressed with Stevo, who he is quoted as saying \\"had the gift of the gab\\" and was \\"immensely likeable\\". Stevo said that he was putting together the Some Bizzare Album, which would include bands that \\"broke down barriers\\". He preferred to include undiscovered bands that he could then license to major record companies through his Some Bizzare label. Stevo wanted to include Soft Cell on the Some Bizzare Album, and also wanted to manage the band. After returning to his home in Leeds, Almond discussed the meeting with bandmate Dave Ball and sought advice from Tony Mayo (of Naked Lunch), who would also appear on the Some Bizzare album. They decided that working with Stevo is what they wanted. Stevo was only seventeen at the time. Depeche Mode Depeche Mode were cautious when first approached by Stevo, they were indecisive about being included on a \\"Futurist\\" compilation album. They first decided to take their demo tape to various other record companies, only to be rejected by everyone.Malins, p. 14 After a bad first meeting with Daniel Miller of Mute Records (Miller was in a bad mood due to a problem with some Fad Gadget artwork)Malins, p. 18 the door was left open for Stevo to include Depeche Mode on his Some Bizzare Album. During an evening at the Bridgehouse, in Canning Town, Stevo chatted with Depeche Mode about his new label and compilation album; the band had been supporting Fad Gadget. It was decided that Depeche Mode would record a track for the Some Bizzare Album. Stevo had then recommended that the band work with Daniel Miller at Mute Records. In 1980, Depeche Mode went into an east London recording studio and recorded the track \\"Photographic\\". Daniel Miller wanted to put a good track on the compilation album, but not their best track. Miller acted as informal producer on the recording of the Some Bizzare version of the \\"Photographic\\" track. The band set up their equipment in the studio and ran through some of their tracks live in the studio. \\"Photographic\\" was recorded and mixed in one day. The The Matt Johnson, of the band The The, first came across Stevo after receiving a series of odd phone calls wanting him to support the band, Cabaret Voltaire.THE SAME ...ONLY DIFFERENT. MATT JOHNSON & JOHNNY MARR IN CONVERSATION . . .. www.thethe.com. Retrieved on 30 December 2009 Johnson was being offered to support the band in Retford, Nottingham. At first he declined due to there being no payment; Stevo insisted it would be good for Johnson's career. In the end Johnson agreed and travelled up to Sheffield in Tony Mayo's (Naked Lunch) old Ford Transit van, along with Stevo, Keith Laws, Tom Johnston, Peter Ashworth (who comprised the band at that time) and Naked Lunch, who were the main support band. The whole concert turned out to be a good experience for Johnson who, afterwards, continued to work with Stevo. Johnson and Laws recorded an untitled track for the Some Bizzare Album. Stevo became Matt Johnson's manager in around 1982 and began looking to sign The The to a major record label.LIP TRIPPING John Wilde ‚Äì Volume ‚Äì 1993. www.thethe.com. Retrieved on 31 December 2009 After the success of Soft Cell, in particular, Stevo began to have immense clout with the major record companies. Johnson and Laws had released the single \\"Cold Spell Ahead\\" on the independent side of Some Bizzare but later Stevo dealt with Decca Records, who paid for Johnson to re-record the song with producer Mike Thorne in New York. The clever thing that Stevo had managed to do was get Decca to pay for the recordings while still keeping ownership of the recordings. This was a good example of how Stevo dealt with the large major recording companies at the time. After Johnson had completed the recordings Stevo began dealing with both Decca and CBS for a record deal. The deal famously went to CBS with a bizarre contract signing in Trafalgar Square.

Looney Tunes directed by Norman McCabe. The short was released on August 1, 1942, and satirizes events of World War II. The title is a pun on dictator. Plot A pair of farm ducks anticipate the hatching of their duckling from an unusually black-colored egg. A white duckling with a toothbrush moustache, Adolf Hitler, emerges from the egg and immediately shouts \\"Sieg Heil!\\" while giving the Nazi salute. Hitler's adulthood is spent giving aggressive speeches toward the other ducks and geese. His only ally is a large black Neapolitan-accented goose, Benito Mussolini, who promotes his own warmongering rhetoric to a solitary chick who is forced to attend and applaud. Hitler's stormtroopers surround the farm while a Dove of Peace, observing from above, weeps in response to the upcoming violence. A peace conference is held between the ducks and geese, but the troubled Hitler puts the peace treaty through a paper shredder and instigates a furious brawl. Meanwhile, an odd Japanese duck, Hideki Tojo, travels to the farm to support Hitler and Mussolini. During his voyage across the sea, he absentmindedly plants a sign reading \\"Japanese Mandate Island\\" onto a turtle's shell. When the turtle emerges and attacks Tojo, he vainly attempts to pass himself off as Chinese. Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo set off with their troops toward the conquest of the farm. The Dove attempts to reason with them, but they ignore and trample him. The Dove violently retaliates and defeats the Axis Powers with the aid of other animals and a Minuteman that emerges from a poster that says \\"For Victory, Buy United States Victory Bonds\\". The Dove concludes the tale to his two children, Peace and Quiet, while proudly displaying the battered heads of his enemies as trophies mounted above his fireplace. A final message invites the audience to express their patriotism by buying state bonds. Political references The first duckling to hatch from the egg had a mustache and a Nazi emblem throughout the cartoon, indicating that the duck symbolized Adolf Hitler. The goose who helped the duck had an open Italian accent, and the chick at the end of one of his speeches could be heard yelling \\"Duce!\\" multiple times, indicating that this goose is Benito Mussolini. The other duck was using the flag of the Empire of Japan, and openly singing \\"The Japanese Sandman\\". He is presumably intended to be Hideki Tojo, judging by the military hat he is wearing. The black duck may be a reference to Rommel as he was also from South Germany and spoke with an accent, but can also relate to how African Americans were a huge demographic in the Southern United States at the time. Changes in Sunset Productions version The ending where the dove is sitting with his kids and points out that his enemies have been defeated (and are now moose-heads above the fireplace), followed by a notice to buy war bonds, has been rarely seen since the short was sold to Sunset Productions in the 1950s and syndicated through them (as Guild Films). As the cartoon is in the public domain, this edited version has frequently been found on VHS and DVD home video collections. However, on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 DVD set and the World War II cartoons special on the Cartoon Network show ToonHeads, the full ending is shown uncut and uncensored. Availability Due to the short's World War II stereotypes, it has rarely been shown on American television, except for Cartoon Network as part of its anthology television show, ToonHeads. The Ducktators is available uncut on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6, Disc 2.

Former stagecoach inn History On September 25, 1817, United States Army Judge Advocate Samuel A. Storrow traveled from Green Bay, Wisconsin to Chicago. He described a Native American village he saw: > \\"...we saw it at a distance. It was a village of Fals Avoines [rice > gatherers], situate on the edge of a prairie which borders Lake Winnebago. > The Lake lay before it on one side, and on the other the prairie, rising > with a gentle acclivity from the margin of the water. The spot was well > chosen for beauty, warmth, and fertility. There was nothing about that > indicated a recent commencement. The grounds bore marks of long cultivation, > and the few trees were left standing seemed as if distributed for ornament > and shade. The village has received the name of Calumet [Pipe]; it consists > of about 150 souls, and has rarely been visited by whites, except a few > voyageurs on their way to Ouisconsin [Wisconsin].\\" Pipe used to be known as Calumet Harbor. George White, who came to Calumet Harbor in 1837, established a hotel and bar along Military Road, then became a real estate agent. He proposed that the town of Calumet be annexed from Calumet County into Fond du Lac County. When the town was annexed into Fond du Lac County in 1842, White was named its first town supervisor. A stagecoach inn was built in 1846 by Henry Fuhrman, which became a major stop on Military Road. The inn was a three-story building with a dance floor on the second floor that served as a gathering place for the youth in the community. The third floor was a rooming house for guests, most often fishermen. Tom Brown purchased the building in the 1940s, named it Club Harbor, and later erected a modern electric sign and added a large cedar dining hall to the building. The inn existed as Club Harbor until it closed in the late 1970s.Kathryn Bartel. \\"Marytown, A Holyland Community: Built on Dreams, Persisting on Spirit, 1849-2003 \\". In Clarence B. Davis (ed.) History by the Lake: Studies in the History of Fond du Lac and the Lake Winnebago Region. Fond du Lac, Wis.: Marian College Press, 2005. Club Harbor was sold in 2004. It has been extensively remodeled and is now called Capone's. The next oldest structure in Pipe was a bank that failed during the Great Depression, closing overnight as a run was made on its deposits. Some time later, the brick building was converted into a butcher shop, which remains to this day. The vault door, made of oak, still exists and serves as the entry to a meat locker. A portable vault now serves as a file system and table top. A cash register manufactured in the 1920s is still in use. A very large, vintage, mechanical Burroughs adding machine in the building was the pride of the corporation, its workings visible through thick glass walls. The viability of the building is now in question because of a proposed widening of Highway 151. The southwest corner of the crossing of Hwy 151 and W held a block building until it was leveled in the 1980s to provide parking for an adjacent fire department. It was a lively gathering place during the 1960s and 1970s as a satellite auction center owned by the Danner family of Glenview, Illinois, but is remembered as a tractor and vehicle garage run for nearly 50 years by Edward Halfman. Regarded as the best mechanic in the Fond du Lac and Calumet area by area residents, consumers had their Ford Model T cars shipped to his garage in crates to be assembled, a cost-saving alternative to purchasing a fully assembled car from a dealer's lot. In his retirement years, Halfman repaired children's bikes and educated young adults about the care and maintenance of their cars. On the northeast corner a small tavern and a large concrete block community hall that held a basketball court on its second floor was razed in the 1980s to make way for a modern bar and grill that features the taxidermy craft of its renter. The southeast corner is a multi-family building but used to be a grocery and hardware store. The largest employer is located just beyond the southern end of Pipe. Groeschel Company, operated by descendants of Frank Groeschel, is a HVAC and sheet metal fabrication company. Two miles east of Pipe is Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm, an electric generation windmill farms. Surveys of wind patterns nationwide in the 1980s identified a potential windmill electric generation path along the Niagara Escarpment from Pipe toward Brownsville. At an average wind speed of 18 mph, this was considered uneconomical for electric generation in the 1980s, but windmill technology improvements and government incentives for alternative energy sources at the dawn of the 21st century quickly transformed farming communities into an electric generation industry. Looking south at Pipe along U.S. Route 151 Transportation Pipe is located on U.S. Route 151. Originally called Fort Howard Military Road, it was one of the first marked routes through the Wisconsin wilderness. The other main road into the community is the east-west County Highway W, which leads to the shore of Lake Winnebago. Cty Hwy W terminates at Calumet Harbor. The public harbor area is a popular regional recreational and camping area, and a boat and ice fishing launch.

The word has an Indo-Iranian root, descendant of the Proto-Indo-European root *eis, making it cognate with the Latin ƒ´ra. In the Zoroastrian texts of the 9th‚Äì12th centuries, aeshma appears as Middle Persian eshm ê≠†ê≠©ê≠±ê≠¨ or ê≠ßê≠©ê≠±ê≠¨ kheshm, continuing in Pazend and New Persian as khashm. Judaism's Asmodeus (Talmudic  º≈°md ºy, Book of Tobit asmodios) derives from Avestan aeshma.daeva.. The Georgian language word for devil‚Äîeshmaki‚Äîlikewise derives from aeshma. In scripture In the hierarchy of Zoroastrian demons (daevas) that mirrors a similar hierarchy of divinities, Aeshma is opposed to Asha Vahishta, the Amesha Spenta that is the hypostasis of \\"Truth.\\" This opposition also reflects Aeshma's position as messenger of Angra Mainyu (Yasht 19.46), for in the hierarchy of divinities, Asha is the messenger of Spenta Mainyu, the instrument through which Ahura Mazda has realized (\\"created by His thought\\") creation. The demon's chief adversary however is Sraosha \\"Obedience\\", the principle of religious devotion and discipline. The opposition between religious obedience and distraction from it is also expressed in the Yasna 10.8's portrayal of Aeshma as the metaphysical endangerment of the Good Religion. Aeshma distracts from proper worship, distorting \\"the intention and meaning of sacrifice through brutality against cattle and violence in war and drunkenness.\\". (Yasna 10.8, Yasht 17.5) According to Yasht 11.15, Ahura Mazda created Sraosha to counter the demon's mischief, and in Yasna 57.25, Sraosha protects the faithful from the fiend's assault. At the renovation of the world, Sraosha overthrows Aeshma, who will flee before the saoshyant (Yasht 19.95), but in the present the fiend flees before Mithra (Yasna 57.10; Yasht 10.97). The demon's opposition to Sraosha is also reflected in their respective standard epithets. While Aeshma's is xrvi.dru- \\"of the bloody mace\\" (e.g. Yasna 10.8, Yasht 11.15), Sraosha's is darshi.dru- \\"of the strong (Ahuric) mace.\\" Aeshma's other epithet's include \\"ill-fated\\" (Yasht 10.95) \\"malignant\\" (Yasna 57.25, Yasht 10.97), and \\"possessing falsehood\\" (drvant-, Yasht 10.93). In Yasht 19.97, the demon has the epithet \\"having his body forfeited,\\" but what is meant by this is uncertain. Aeshma can be driven away by the recitation of a prayer. (Vendidad 11.9) In tradition and folklore In the Zoroastrian texts of the 9th‚Äì12th centuries, the function of battling Aeshma is also ascribed to Mithra (Zand-i Wahman yasn 7.34), and Denkard 3.116 places him in opposition to Vohu Manah. The demon is made commander by Angra Mainyu (Zatspram 34.32) and although he is closely related to Az, the demon of \\"avarice\\", Az will eventually swallow him up. The opposition to Sraosha is continued into the later tradition. In the even later Rivayats (epistles), a Yasna ceremony that is not properly executed is said to have been done as if the ceremony were for Aeshma. References Bibliography * . * . * .

History In 1809, Philadelphia was already known for both skilled workers and as America's main financial center, but the merchants who controlled its banks had little interest in lending to mechanics or manufacturers. So a small group of artisans and master craftsmen resolved to organize one that would be run by and for the mechanics themselves. The following January, they adopted a set of bylaws that required all directors to be mechanics currently working at their trades and prohibited mercantile investments like ships. The bank would also be one of the first to acquire its capital from a large number of small shareholders instead of a few large investors. While the organizers bought some stock themselves, they reserved most of the 14,000 shares for a public sale at Independence Hall the next month. There wasn't enough room in the building for everyone who wanted to buy stock ‚Äì according to one report, a man lost his hat and wig trying to climb in a window ‚Äì and nearly 700 people were turned away. Within an hour, they had adjourned to a nearby coffeehouse and organized the Commercial Bank. By the end of the day, five more banks had been organized in the city. The pundits were skeptical. An editorial entitled \\"Infatuation\\" appeared in several newspapers: Within weeks, the legislature had banned unchartered associations from most banking activities and the new bank temporary closed, lent most of its capital back to the shareholders, and began lobbying for a charter, which was finally granted in 1814. For its first twenty years, the \\"Banking House\\" was a three-story brick building formerly occupied by a hat and bonnet maker (the vault was an addition in the back yard) and by 1833, it had become completely inadequate for its purpose. After a burglar took $3,995 in gold and silver one night, an inspection found the building \\"in a decayed state and in many parts quite insecure.\\" Despite some hasty repairs, the bank outgrew the building within two years, temporarily expanded into the house next door and began to buy land on the opposite side of Third Street. Unfortunately, it was only able to obtain two adjacent lots, resulting in a narrow site flanked by higher buildings on both sides. William Strickland's building In the summer of 1836, the directors authorized \\"the erection of a Banking House...to be completed in a substantial manner of the best material, for $19,930.\\" Their choice as architect and contractor was William Strickland, one of the most prominent in Philadelphia and a pioneer of the Greek Revival style who had already designed the Second Bank of the United States on Chestnut Street and was working on new buildings for the Bank of Philadelphia and Merchants' Exchange. In addition, he had personal ties to the bank, whose directors included several contractors he had worked with, as well as colleagues from the Franklin Institute and his wife's cousin. Because of the narrow lot at 22 S. 3rd St, the Mechanics' Bank is one of Strickland's smallest buildings, but the challenge seems to have inspired him. The heavier square pilasters that support the corners of the portico instead of round columns and the especially fine stone carving (by his longtime partner John Struthers) help to keep the building from being overwhelmed by its bulkier neighbors. Because the side walls faced very narrow alleys, most of the building was a single high room in which a large skylight lit both the main banking room with its U-shaped mahogany counter and the president and cashier's offices, which were separated from the main room by lower partitions of wood paneling. The vault and second-story directors‚Äô room occupied a narrower wing at the back. In November 1837, the building committee reported that \\"the Banking House of the Mechanics' Bank is not inferior to any in the city either in its appearance, exterior or interior, nor in respect to its perfect adaptation to the use for which it has been erected.\\" Unfortunately, their satisfaction with Strickland's architecture didn't extend to his business practices: he had sent them a bill for $3,920 in additional expenses resulting from changes to the corners of the portico and the arrangement of the vault and offices. They claimed not to have authorized most of them and refused to pay the additional money, perhaps in part because the charter limited expenditures on land and buildings for the banking house to $50,000. Final years By the time the bank moved into Strickland's building, the bank's character had already begun to change. The original organizers had been among the city's most successful craftsmen (most employed many apprentices and journeymen and several had sidelines as merchants as well as their trades), but most still had started as apprentices and worked alongside their employees, but starting with the 1814 charter, directors no longer had to be active mechanics, and a few merchants, \\"gentlemen,\\" and professional bankers began to join the board. As industrial manufacturing replaced handicraft, factory owners and managers replaced the remaining artisans and master craftsmen. The bank continued to specialize in funding the manufacturing industries and Philadelphia mechanics, continued to lead the world in building and maintaining the equipment that it required, but by the time it became part of the new federal banking system as Mechanics National Bank, it answered to mechanics‚Äô employers, not the mechanics themselves. The surviving records of Mechanics National Bank end in 1900. Two years later, it bought back most of its stock, and on February 16, 1903, the fifteen remaining shareholders voted to dissolve the corporation and transfer its business to Girard National Bank. Subsequent owners rented the building to various other banks until the depression; then sold it to the Norwegian Seaman's Mission, which remodeled it as a chapel and social service center for sailors until 1982 when the dwindling congregation moved to Old Swedes‚Äô Church in South Philadelphia and sold the building at auction. After twenty-five years as the legendary Club Revival and several other bars including an ill-fated Coyote Ugly and Foggy Goggles, the building has seen a rebirth. The current tenants have chosen the historically pertinent name, National Mechanics, to make an upscale bar and restaurant where the d√©cor and demeanor tip their respective hats to the building's original incarnation. The front of the structure remains as Strickland built it, but the rear and interior have been greatly altered. In 1898, the architect James Windrim renovated it for the bank, replacing Strickland's vault and directors room (as well as a small office added later) with a much larger two story structure of fireproof brick and iron construction, while the church divided the main room into two stories and added additional office space at the rear in 1930 and later tenants made further changes.  Notable directors and customers  John Aitken (subscriber), Music publisher and composer Most of the founders of the Mechanics' Bank were artisans who had served traditional apprenticeships but whose later paths set them apart from their peers. John Aitken was a silversmith in his native Scotland, but when he moved to Philadelphia in 1785, he became one of North America's first music publishers. While his competitors printed sheet music using hand-engraved metal plates, Aitken introduced the use of standardized punches to stamp notes onto the plates, a faster process which also produced more legible scores. In 1807, Aitken opened a music store at 76 North Second Street in an odd-looking building known as \\"Jones‚Äôs Folly.\\" In addition to his publishing business, he dabbled in composition (with little success) and rented the second floor to an Englishman by the name of Blake, who gave flute and \\"clarionet\\" lessons until he was visited by a group of Quaker elders and told to \\"stop teaching the clarionet to our boys or we will have thee put in prison.\\" Rudolph ‚ÄúOld Dutch Cleanser‚Äù Blankenburg (director), Mayor of Philadelphia In 1911, Rudolph Blankenburg became Philadelphia's 164th mayor. A German-born dry-goods manufacturer and merchant, he had been active in local affairs since 1880 and was affectionately known as \\"Old Dutch Cleanser\\" because of his origins and zealous dedication to reform. During his four years in office, he tried to replace the political cronies appointed by predecessors like John Reyburn with trained professionals, instituted a modern civil service system with on-the-job training and standardized employee benefits, and systematized city contracts. His wife, Lucretia Longshore Blankenburg, was a prominent women's suffragist and an important reform activist in her own right. George H. Boker (director), Playwright and poet While almost forgotten today, George Henry Boker was a well-known poet, playwright, and diplomat in the mid-19th century. He was originally trained as a lawyer but after traveling in Europe, he was inspired to become a writer instead. He published a few books of unremarkable lyric poetry in the 1840s and then turned to drama, becoming one of the most successful American playwrights by the mid-1850s. He specialized in blank verse romantic tragedies, usually in historical European settings; his best known was the 1855 Francesca da Rimini. In the 1860s, he returned to writing lyric poetry, especially sonnets. During the Civil War, Boker helped organize (and later became president of) the Union League to support the war effort and published Poems of the War, a collection of lyric poetry In recognition of his services, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him Minister (Ambassador) to the Ottoman Empire in 1871 and, four years later, to Russia. His father, Charles S. Boker, was also a director of the Mechanics' bank, and later was president of the much larger Girard Bank during the 1857-8 financial crisis. George Boker's The Book of the Dead was a response to his father's posthumous critics. Edward H. Coates (director), Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts Mechanics' Bank director Edward H. Coates was a businessman and art patron most notorious for his association with Thomas Eakins, perhaps the greatest American realist painter. As chairman of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts‚Äô Committee on Instruction, Coates was instrumental in appointing Eakins as director and supported reforms like teaching anatomy from nude models instead of plaster casts. In 1883, the two served together on a University of Pennsylvania's committee to oversee the photographer Eadweard Muybridge's pioneering studies of human and animal movement. However, he soon grew uncomfortable with many of his practices, especially his use of students as models. In 1885, he commissioned \\"The Swimming Hole,\\" but rejected the finished painting for its explicit and erotic depiction of male students and friends. The following year, he fired Eakins for removing a drapery from a male model in front of female students, though he continued to buy his paintings. His brother, George M. Coates, was also a director of the bank. Abner Davis (director), Nail factor and jailer Nail manufacturer Abner Davis's life shows how Philadelphia's economy shifted from handicraft to industry in the early days of the 19th century. Colonial blacksmiths forged nails one at a time, but by the 1790s, machines had been developed that could cut many nails from one long iron bar and, later, shape the heads as well. Davis was one of the first to adopt this new technology: in addition to running his own shop, he was in 1795 appointed as an assistant keeper at the Walnut Street Prison to \\"help direct the work‚Ä¶ of the Men in the Yard, Smith Shop, & Nail Factory,\\" which he had set up. William Flintham (director), Cooper and would-be merchant The bank drew its early directors from among Philadelphia's most successful tradesmen. Most of these employed many apprentices and journeymen and some moved on to become manufacturers or merchants ‚Äì with varying success. In 1807, William Flintham invested profitably in shipping some flaxseed to Ireland. A generation later, the antiquarian Abraham Ritter recalled that \\"Mr Flintham was a very active and intelligent man, whose mechanical trade could not confine his genius; and passing from the cooper-shop to the counting-house, entered more extensively in the shipping business, but alas, in fine, not to profit.\\" William Gaul William Gaul (director), Malt manufacturer and brewer Director William Gaul was part of a large family of brewers in Philadelphia. His father, Frederick Gaul, had come to the city from Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany in 1804 and owned the former Robert Hare brewery which had made George Washington's favorite porter. William Gaul was a successful malt manufacturer and dealer as well as brewer and built one of the first mansions on North Broad Street. It later became the home of the actor Edwin Forrest and, after his death, a home for retired actors and now forms part of the Freedom Theater complex. His descendants remain in the brewing business to this day ‚Äì one of his daughters married a Yuengling. Joseph Gillingham (director), Merchant and engineer Although Joseph Gillingham was a merchant, not a mechanic, he shared the other early directors‚Äô interest in manufacturing and technology. With Josiah White, he built a water-powered nail factory at the Falls of Schuylkill (now East Falls). In 1817, they offered to build a water-powered pumping station to fill the reservoir at Fairmount (now the site of the Philadelphia Museum of Art), but the water department decided to continue to use steam pumps. Three years later, the city changed its mind, bought them out, and constructed a station on their plan just below the reservoir. Uriah Hunt (director), Publisher A generation after his death, Publishers‚Äô Weekly still fondly remembered \\"Uriah Hunt, the tall, serene, and in every way worthy and admirable Quaker publisher of county and other school books and useful works.\\" One of Hunt's best-selling authors was Parson Mason Weems, the fanciful biographer who invented the story of George Washington chopping down his father's cherry tree. Jacob Johnson and William Woodward (directors), Publishers Both Johnson and Woodward published religious books, primarily for western, rural markets, and pioneered new methods of wholesale and \\"mail- order\\" distribution. Johnson and his partner Benjamin Warner both traveled extensively and built personal relationships with small town merchants and booksellers, while Woodward relied on his reputation for personal piety to gain the trust of local ministers who handled his distribution for him. Philip Justice (director), Manufacturer and war profiteer Philip Justice owned a factory for cast steel springs and other railroad parts and equipment in North Philadelphia. He was the first American to import steel tires for railroad cars, which he sold to Philadelphia's Baldwin Locomotive works. During the Civil War, he invented \\"an improved mode of attaching Armor Plates to Vessels\\" and he turned over much of his plant to military production, but he seems to have been far more interested in profit than patriotism: an investigation and court case found that, in the words of the US Supreme Court, \\"the arms were unserviceable and unsafe for troops to handle.\\" Stephen North (director), Pharmacist Stephen North was a pharmacist and early director of the bank. In 1821, the University of Pennsylvania announced that its medical school would establish a pharmacy program, a move that local pharmacists saw as an attempt by physicians to take over their profession. In response, North chaired a meeting where they started their own College of Apothecaries and Penn shelved its plans. This institution later became the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and is now the University of the Sciences. George D. Rosengarten (Director), Accountant, Pennsylvania Railroad Director and Quinine Distributor In 1821, the 20-year-old George D. Rosengarten was called in to mediate a dispute between two business partners, Seitler, a Frenchman who spoke only French and Zeitler, a German who spoke only German. Rosengarten, a German immigrant who was fluent in both (as well as English), was so helpful that they took him on as a partner and within two years he had become the sole owner of the company. The business began to prosper after he took on another partner, NFH Denis, a French chemist who was an expert in processing the malaria drug quinine, which financed the company's expansion. Its products won numerous awards from the Franklin Institute and by 1862 it was selling more than 350 different chemicals and was the main provider of quinine to the Union Army. Charles G. Leland Frederick Lennig (director), Chemical Manufacturer Another German, Nicholas Lennig established the Tacony Chemical Works in 1831 but died soon after. His son, Charles, and nephew Frederick Lennig (a Mechanics' Bank director) inherited the factory. At the Centennial Exposition in 1876, they were awarded a medal \\"for the products exhibited coming from the distillation of wood, for metallic salts and especially for the careful manufacture of sulphate of alumina and alum\\". Charles Godfrey Leland (customer, son of director), Poet, folklorist, and educator Charles G. Leland was a poet, folklorist, antiquarian, libertarian and educator. Born in Philadelphia, he matriculated from what is now Princeton University in 1845 and traveled extensively in Europe and the America's studying Romany, witch and Native American cultures. His first literary acclaim was for the comedies, The Hans Breitmann Ballads, and was followed by his more serious folklore studies. Throughout his career he produced more than 50 books including The English Gypsies (1873), Algonquin Legends (1884) and Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches (1899). He died in Florence, Italy in 1903 and his ashes were interred in Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery. His works are still read today by Wicca's and others interested in folk history for their fine lyrical content and first-hand sources of antiquated incantations and spells. Ebenezer Maxwell (director), Eminent Victorian Ebenezer Maxwell was a cloth merchant. In 1859, he built a mansion on Walnut Lane in Germantown, not far from the home of his friend and fellow director Joseph G. Mitchell. The building is now a museum of Victorian architecture and design.

The novels interrelate United States history from Reconstruction to the Great Depression with Herbst's family history, reflecting the ideological crises of the early twentieth century.\\"No Moss,\\" Time Magazine, Monday, May. 29, 1933 The trilogy has been compared with John Dos Passos's major work, the U.S.A. trilogy, which was published in the same decade.Rope of Gold book review at Monthly Review, Dec, 1985 by Annette T. Rubinstein Origins and inspiration Many characters in the trilogy are inspired by Herbst's family including Victoria, the main character, which is based on Herbst herself, and Joe, inspired by her father. A majority of the political events and themes represented in the novel and its sequels are based on experiences stemming from Herbst's prior work as a Leftist journalist, which was published in The New Masses and The Nation. As for the novel's themes and the related title, Herbst wrote of her characters: \\"pity cannot save them. . . . The old standbys . . . religion, respectability, are so many straw bridges.\\"The Literary Encyclopedia: Josephine Herbst by Angela E. Hubler, Kansas State University Plot introduction Pity Is Not Enough follows the Trexler's history after the American Civil War and before World War I. While the main narrative focuses on the Trexler family, the chronology is often disrupted by inter- chapters focusing on Victoria's childhood. Victoria recalls her mother, Catherine, telling the story of her unfortunate brother Joe Trexler, a man who had left his family's home in Philadelphia to work as a carpetbagger in Reconstruction-era Georgia. When trouble began to hound him, he escaped first to Canada, where he made acquaintances with the Governor of Georgia, and then returned home for a short while. He manages to escape from the local law by moving again, this time to the west where he joined the gold rush in the Black Hills in Dakota Territory. Future promises of financial success do not become fruitful for Joe or for the majority of his family. His favorite sister Catherine dies relatively young, his two other sisters marry failures who are unable to support them properly, and his younger brother, Aaron, becomes a moderate success but is relatively unhappy. His youngest brother, David, does have some success. Over time Joe slowly falls into dementia. Victoria eventually comes to the conclusion that her Uncle Joe's failure, like her father's failure in business, is not due to personal shortcomings, but to capitalist economic forces beyond their control.

Reid (1849 ‚Äî December 12, 1937) was a Canadian American who was a Presbyterian minister. He served as the second president of Montana State University from 1894 to 1904. Life and career James R. Reid was born in 1849 in Dundas County, Ontario, Canada, to Samuel and Nancy (Marlin) Reid. His father was an Ulster Scot born in County Londonderry, Ireland, and his mother was an Ulster Scot born in County Antrim, Ireland.Progressive Men of the State of Montana, p. 387.National Cyclopedia of American Biography, p. 95. Accessed 2013-08-19. His mother was born in 1812, and emigrated to Canada in 1828. Samuel and Nancy married in 1835, and Samuel died in 1860. Reid was one of 11 children, only seven of which survived into adulthood. Nancy Reid lived, never remarrying, until 1908. Reid spent his childhood working on his father's farm, and attended local public school. After graduation from junior high school at the age of 16, he taught public school in a neighboring public school system. He later attended high school in Metcalfe, Ontario, although it is not clear if he graduated. After leaving high school, Reid worked in the lumber business for five years, then emigrated to the United States and spent two years working at various jobs in New York City. Deciding to continue his education, Reid enrolled at the University of Toronto and then transferred to the Collegiate Institute in Hamilton, Ontario. He then transferred to McGill University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1881. Reid decided to enter the ministry, and studied theology for two years at Union Theological Seminary in New York city. This was followed by two more years of theological study at The Presbyterian College of Montreal, where he graduated with a Master of Divinity degree. He spent another year in theological study at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. About 1886, the First Presbyterian Church in Bay City, Michigan, called Reid to be their minister. He spent three years there, also acting as principal of the local high school and engaged in business. He moved back to New York City in 1889, where he spent a few months in graduate study again at Union Theological Seminary. In the spring of 1889, Reid was appointed president of the College of Montana, a Presbyterian college in Deer Lodge, Montana. He also served as the pastor of the Prebysterian Church in the town. He was appointed to and was the first president of the Montana State Council of Education, serving from 1891 to 1894. He was elected president of the Montana State Teachers' Association (now MEA-MFT) in 1894, and served on the Montana State Board of Education for three years. Montana State University The Agricultural College of the State of Montana (now known as Montana State University) was founded in Bozeman, Montana, in February 1893. Its first president, Augustus M. Ryon, was a mining engineer who clashed with the college's Board of Regents and local businessmen about the direction of the college. Ryon wanted the school to focus on technical, mechanical, industrial, and engineering arts, while the regents and others wanted an agricultural focus. Ryon was forced out in 1894 and Reid named his successor.Smith, p. 174. The college grew quickly under Reid, who provided the campus with 10 years of stability and relative harmony. The school's first classes were held in rooms in the Gallatin County high school, and later that year in the shuttered Bozeman Academy (a private preparatory school). By the time Reid assumed the presidency of the college, the student body had grown so quickly that the college completely occupied the high school building. A vacant store on Main Street was also rented to provide additional classroom space. The college had long been promised of land on the south side of Bozeman, and the donation of land finally occurred in 1895. Under Reid, both the Agricultural Experiment Station (now known as Taylor Hall) and the Main Building (now known as Montana Hall) began construction in 1896. The agricultural building was the first to open, and both structures were occupied in 1898. To accommodate the rapid rise in enrollment, Reid also hired a large number of faculty.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Presidential Debate: Who Were MSU‚Äôs Most Important Presidents?\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. July 17, 2011. Accessed 2013-08-14. The university football team was established in 1897, and the college graduated its first four students that same year. The curriculum expanded into civil and electrical engineering in 1898. According to Montana historians Pierce Mullen, Robert Rydell, and Jeff Safford, Reid ensured the college's survival. The state legislature had not clearly defined roles for either the Bozeman campus or its rival in Missoula (now the University of Montana). The lack of mission and the internecine battles with Ryon undermined support for the college, but Reid's moral authority, his popularity as a speaker, and his steady leadership made the Agricultural College a \\"viable shadow\\" to the Missoula school. \\"He put [Montana State University] on the right path,\\" Mullen said. Reid's vision for the college was practical and moral. He believed the curriculum at the school should emphasize skills students would need once they left campus. Thus, his focus was on agricultural architecture and engineering, agronomy, animal husbandry, and farming methods. Reid also firmly believed the college should offer a moral education as well. The first three decades of the 20th century were rowdy ones on the college campus. Bozeman had a large red-light district by 1900, alcohol was plentiful and cheap, and there was little in the way of organized entertainment such as theaters to occupy the student body. President Reid spent much of his presidency cracking down on dancing, drinking, gambling, and prostitution by students. James R. Reid resigned for health reasons in 1904, and was succeeded as president by Dr. James M. Hamilton, an economist. Personal life, retirement, and death Reid met Ella Holden while traveling in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1902. He moved to Montreal in 1904 and married her. The couple had two children. The Reids moved to Riverside, California, in 1919. James Reid died in Riverside on December 6, 1937. References Bibliography *National Cyclopedia of American Biography. New York: James T.

The P35 Express chipset supports Intel's LGA 775 socket and Core 2 Duo and Quad processors, and is also known to support 45 nm Wolfdale/Yorkfield dual and quad core CPUs. Theoretically, Intel also dropped support for Intel's Pentium 4 and Pentium D processors with this chipset although late Pentium 4 processors, including both the 32-bit-only (5x0) and the 32-bit/64-bit (5x1), and a few others, were fully supported. It is notable for providing the first commodity support of DDR3 SDRAM. (It also supports DDR2 SDRAM; the choice is made by the motherboard manufacturer, and some manufacturers supported both DDR3 and DDR2 on the same motherboard, but only one memory type at a time, often 4√ó DDR2 or 2√ó DDR3, as in the Gigabyte GA-EP35C-DS3L/R; but DDR3-only models, such as the Gigabyte GA-EP35T-DS3L/R and the DDR2-only models, such as the Gigabyte GA-EP35-DS3L/R were also made, concurrently.) Another notable point is that it does not provide Parallel ATA support; most 2007 motherboards added PATA support via a JMicron JMB361 or JMB363 chip.
