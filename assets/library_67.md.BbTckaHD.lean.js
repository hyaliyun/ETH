It was designed by the Oklahoma City architectural firm of Bozalis, Dickinson and Roloff as a concrete structure with a distinctive gold geodesic dome roof. The facility was completed in 1967 with 987 seats on the main level and 513 seats in a balcony, totaling to 1,500. The co-founder of Temcor, the project's contractor, was Don Richter, a student of Buckminster Fuller, developer of the geodesic dome concept. Temcor had built several gold-anodized aluminum domes before the Pioneer, and was responsible for more than 5000 dome projects. Originally to be called the Apollo Theater, the Pioneer took its name from a 1939 statue of a pioneer family by Byron S. Johnson, salvaged from the Old State Building, which was demolished to make way for the new facility. Unofficially, the dome was called the \\"Golden Turtle.\\" It consists of a 500-panel aluminum shell on an inner steel frame, which is in turn supported by reinforced concrete arches. The orchestra level of the theater is depressed below ground level, allowing the roof to nearly touch the ground at the corners. The Washoe County Fair and Recreation Board, which was responsible for the project, was particularly taken with Casa Mañana in Fort Worth, Texas, resulting in the selection of the domed concept. The Pioneer Center was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

The Philippines consist of numerous upland and lowland indigenous ethnolinguistic groups living in the country, with Austronesians making up the overwhelming majority, while full or partial Australo-Melanesians scattered throughout the archipelago. The highland Austroneians and Australo-Melanesians have co-existed with their lowland Austronesian kin and neighbor groups for thousands of years in the Philippine archipelago. The primary difference is that they were not absorbed by centuries of Spanish and United States colonization of the Philippines, and in the process have retained their customs and traditions. This is mainly due to the rugged inaccessibility of the mountains and established headhunting and warrior cultures, which discouraged Spanish and American colonizers from coming into contact with the highlanders. In the interest of clarity, the term indigenous as used in the Philippines refers to ethnolinguistic groups or subgroups that maintain lt of partial isolation, or independence, throughout the colonial era. The term indigenous when applied to the Philippine population can be a deceptive misnomer, connoting alien migrant populations who have over time become the majority ethnolinguistic and cultural group in the land and thereby pushing indigens to the fringes of socio-cultural inclusion, such as in the Americas, Middle East, Australia, or New Zealand. Contrarily, the vast majority of people in the Philippines descend from the same Austronesian and Australo- Melanesian ancestral populations indigenous to the archipelago, regardless of cultural, religious, ethnolinguistic or tribal affiliations. (Ethnic groups in the Philippines). Culturally-indigenous peoples of northern Philippine highlands can be grouped into the Igorot (comprising many different groups) and singular Bugkalot groups, while the non-Muslim culturally-indigenous groups of mainland Mindanao are collectively called Lumad. Australo-Melanesian groups throughout the archipelago are termed Aeta, Ita, Ati, Dumagat, among others. Numerous culturally-indigenous groups also live outside these two indigenous corridors.National Commission on Indigenous Peoples Accessed November 15, 2013. According to the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino, there are 135 recognized local indigenous Austronesian languages in the Philippines, of which one (Tagalog) is vehicular and each of the remaining 134 is vernacular. There are 134 ethnic groups in the Philippines, the majority of which are indigenous, though much of the overall Philippine population is constituted by only 8-10 lowland ethnic groups. Overview Demographics In the 1990s, there were more than 100 highland tribal groups constituting approximately 3% of the population. The upland tribal groups were a blend in ethnic origin, like those in lowland areas of the country, although the upland tribal groups do not interact nor intermingle with the latter. Because they displayed a variety of social organization, cultural expression and artistic skills. They showed a high degree of creativity, usually employed to embellish utilitarian objects, such as bowls, baskets, clothing, weapons and spoons. The tribal groups of the Philippines are known for their carved wooden figures, baskets, weaving, pottery and weapons. Ethnic groups Northern Philippines The traditional Kalinga dancers. These groups ranged from various Igorot tribes, a group that includes the Bontoc, Ibaloi, Ifugao, Isneg, Kalinga, Kankanaey and Tinguian, who built the Rice Terraces. They also covered a wide spectrum in terms of their integration and acculturation with lowland Christian and Muslim Filipinos. Native groups such as the Bukidnon in Mindanao, had intermarried with lowlanders for almost a century. Other groups such as the Kalinga in Luzon have remained isolated from lowland influence. There were several upland groups living in the Cordillera Central of Luzon in 1990. At one time it was employed by lowland Filipinos in a pejorative sense, but in recent years it came to be used with pride by native groups in the mountain region as a positive expression of their ethnic identity. The Ifugao of Ifugao province, the Bontoc, Kalinga, Tinguian, the Kankanaey and Ibaloi were all farmers who constructed the rice terraces for many centuries. Other mountain peoples of Luzon are the Isnag of the province of Apayao, the Gaddang of the border between Kalinga and Isabela provinces and the Ilongot of Nueva Vizcaya province and Caraballo Mountains all developed hunting and gathering, farming cultivation and headhunting. Other groups such as the Negritos formerly dominated the highlands throughout the islands for thousands of years, but have been reduced to a small population, living in widely scattered locations, primarily along the eastern ranges of the mountains. Southern Philippines Moro woman (c. 1904). In the southern Philippines, upland and lowland tribal groups were concentrated on Mindanao and western Visayas, although there are several upland groups such as the Mangyan living in Mindoro. Among the most important groups found on Mindanao are collectively called the Lumad, and includes the Manobo which is a bigger ethnographic group such as the Ata-Manobo and the Matigsalug found in Davao City, Davao del Norte and Bukidnon Province; the Langilan-Manobo in Davao del Norte; the Agusan- Manobo in Agusan del Sur and southern parts of Agusan del Norte; the Pulanguiyon-Manobo of Bukidnon Province; the Ubo-Manobo in southwestern parts of Davao City, and northern parts of North Cotabato Province that is also to include the Arumanen-Manobo of Carmen (N. Cotabato); the Dulangan-Manobo in the Province of Sultan Kudarat; the Talaandig, Higaonon and Bukidnon of Bukidnon province, Bagobo, Mandaya, Mansaka, Tagakaulo in Davao region who inhabited the mountains bordering the Davao Gulf; the Kalagan lives particularly in lowland areas and seashores of Davao del Norte, Compostella Valley, Davao Oriental and some seashores in Davao Del Sur, the Subanon of upland areas in Zamboanga; the Mamanua in the Agusan-Surigao border region; the B'laan, Teduray and Tboli in the region of the Cotabato province, and the Samal. Samal is synonymous with Luwa'an. Yakan is the indigenous tribe in the hinterlands of Basilan Province. In the lowland lives the Sama Banguingui tribe while in coastal areas there leave the nomadic Luwa'an. Sulu lowland areas are also home of the Sama Banguingui. The Sama or the Sinama and the Jama Mapun are the indigenous tribes in the province of Tawi-Tawi. 2012 DepED- ARMM Orthography for MTB-MLE Reservations Kampilan are weapons used by Rajahs and Datus. The Philippine government succeeded in establishing a number of protected reservations for tribal groups. Highland peoples were expected to speak their native language, dress in their traditional tribal clothing, live in houses constructed of natural materials using traditional architectural designs and celebrate their traditional ceremonies of propitiation of spirits believed to be inhabiting their environment. They are also encouraged to re- establish their traditional authority structure in which, as in indigenous society were governed by chieftains known as Rajah and Datu. Contact between primitive and modern ethnic groups usually resulted in weakening or destroying tribal culture without assimilating the indigenous groups into modern society. It seemed doubtful that the shift of the Philippine government policy from assimilation to cultural pluralism could reverse the process. Several Filipino tribes tend to lead to the abandonment of traditional culture because land security makes it easier for tribal members to adopt the economic process of the larger society and facilitates marriage with outsiders. In the past, the Philippine government bureaus could not preserve tribes as social museum exhibits, but with the aid of various nationwide organizations, they hoped to help the people adapt to modern society without completely losing their ethnic identity.

The production starred Mark Rylance as Johnny \\"Rooster\\" Byron and Mackenzie Crook as Ginger. After receiving rave reviews, its run was extended. In January 2010 it transferred to the Apollo Theatre; it played on Broadway in the summer of 2011. The play has achieved wide-acclaim and has been described as \\"the greatest British play of the [21st] century\\" and one of the \\"best plays of all time\\". Butterworth's Jerusalem is not to be confused with the 2005 play of the same name by Simon Armitage.  Synopsis  On St. Georges Day, the morning of the local county fair, Johnny \\"Rooster\\" Byron, local waster and modern-day Pied Piper, is a wanted man. The council officials want to serve him an eviction notice, his son wants him to take him to the fair, Troy Whitworth wants to give him a serious kicking, and a motley crew of mates want his ample supply of drugs and alcohol.Butterworth, J. Jerusalem, Nick Hern Books, London, 2009.  Characters  Jerusalem has a cast of around 14: Johnny \\"Rooster\\" Byron – opinionated eccentric ex-daredevil and teller of fantastically improbable stories, he has a young son whom he rarely sees, and lives in a caravan in the local woods. He holds parties where he gets drunk and supplies drugs, some of them to under-age kids. Ginger – underdog of the group, he is older than the others who hang around with Johnny, never having grown out of the lifestyle. He aspires to be a DJ, but is an unemployed plasterer. The Professor – vague and whimsical, the elderly professor spouts philosophical nothings and unwittingly takes LSD. Davey – young teenage abattoir worker who is best friends with Lee, and visits Rooster regularly for free drugs and alcohol. He can't stand the idea of leaving Wiltshire. Troy Whitworth – local thug, the same age as Ginger; his stepdaughter, whom (it is strongly implied) he sexually abuses, goes missing in the play; he badly beats Johnny up at the end of the play. Lee – young teenager, he enters the play having been hidden in the sofa asleep after about 15 minutes; he plans to emigrate to Australia the next day, despite having little money to take with him. Phaedra – Troy's stepdaughter, she is seen at the beginning of both Act One and Two singing the hymn \\"Jerusalem\\" dressed in fairy wings, and her disappearance is referred to; only at the end of Act Two it is revealed that she is hiding in Johnny's caravan. Pea and Tanya – two local girls who emerge from underneath Johnny's caravan, having fallen asleep drunk there. Dawn – Johnny's ex-girlfriend and mother to his child, though she disapproves of his lifestyle; having spent some time with him she relapses and kisses him, but there is no reconciliation. Marky – Johnny's six-year-old son. Wesley – the local pub landlord, he is involved in the festivities for St George's Day and has been roped into doing the Morris Dancing. Linda Fawcett and Luke Parsons – the council officials. Frank Whitworth – Brother of Troy Whitworth Danny Whitworth – Younger brother of Troy and Frank Whitworth Inspiration for the play The character of Johnny \\"Rooster\\" Byron was based on retired builder Micky Lay, who lived in a caravan in Pewsey, Wiltshire. Rylance met Lay and modelled his performance on Lay's mannerisms; he later gave Lay the Tony award he had received for his performance. Lay died of a heart attack while waiting for his local pub to open in December 2013. Though the location of events is not specified in the play, the community depicted is based on Pewsey, and the local festival is modelled on Pewsey's annual carnival fortnight. The play makes frequent allusions to William Blake's lyrics to the song \\"Jerusalem\\", from which its title is derived.  Productions   2009 Royal Court  The premiere of the play was at the Royal Court Theatre in London in the downstairs Jerwood Theatre. The staging involved live chickens, a live tortoise and goldfish, and several real trees surrounding an onstage caravan. It was directed by Ian Rickson and starred Mark Rylance as Johnny, Mackenzie Crook as Ginger, Alan David as the Professor, Tom Brooke as Lee, Danny Kirrane as Davey, Gerard Horan as Wesley and Barry Sloane as Troy Whitworth, Aimee- Ffion Edwards as Phaedra, Lucy Montgomery as Dawn and Dan Poole as Danny. It received very positive reviews all round: > There are several of the Royal Court's trademark \\"in your face\\" shock > tactics and an exceptionally high swear word count even by the exacting > standards of the address, this rich three-hour play is also tender, > touching, and blessed with both a ribald humour and a haunting sense of the > mystery of things. — The Daily Telegraph > Jerusalem is a bold, ebullient and often hilarious State-of-England or > (almost) State-of-Olde-England play...

Tim Walker in the Sunday Telegraph wrote of the character of Rooster: \\"With his chest out and his head back, lined up in a vertical line with his bottom, the actor does indeed resemble a rooster. The problem with the term 'local personality,' however, is that it is all too often a polite euphemism for a crushing bore, and three hours in Rooster's company does prove to be something of an endurance test.\\" Rylance won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his performance.Akbar, Arifa (22 March 2010). \\"From a play without a venue to a first for the Olivier Awards\\".

History Although Iceland had been ruled by Denmark, which officially adopted driving on the right in 1793, it had continued to drive on the left; a plan to switch to right-hand traffic was interrupted by World War II, when the country was under British military occupation, as military traffic was greater than that of civilians. Iceland's parliament (Alþingi) made the following demand of the government on 13 May 1964: \\"Alþingi urges the government to initiate as soon as possible research into how best to move the traffic to the right hand side of the road.\\" A law was passed in 1965, under which the country would change to driving on the right in 1968. The decision by Sweden to change to right hand traffic in 1967, bringing it into line with other Nordic countries, also influenced Iceland's decision. In addition, Iceland was hosting an increased number of visitors from the United States and mainland Europe. The Traffic Commission (Umferðarnefnd) was assigned to handle the task. The cost of the change amounted to over 33 million kronur for modifications to buses and 12 million kronur for changes to infrastructure.

Life The story is of a woman tending sheep when she was approached by a London merchant and asked whether she would care to work in his house in London. Having agreed she found herself working for him and then marrying him; and after him a second citizen of London and then a third, who had the honour of being elected Lord Mayor. This third was Sir John Percival, Lord Mayor in 1498. As his widow Thomasine, Lady Percival, devoted her considerable wealth to supporting charitable works. She was active within the businesses of her three husbands, and appears to have continued being active in business as a widow, being wealthy and successful enough to loan money to the King.Carole Levin, Anna Riehl Bertolet, Jo Eldridge Carney, A Biographical Encyclopedia of Early Modern Englishwomen The story is reported by Richard Carew in his Survey of Cornwall (1602),Carew, p. 119 when writing of the parish of Week St Mary in north Cornwall. It is given fuller treatment in Davies Gilbert's Parochial History of Cornwall (1838).Gilbert, vol. 4, p. 132 Both authorities state the young woman's name as Thomasine Bonaventure, though the surname might refer to her good fortune rather than her ancestors. A legacy in her will to a brother, 'John Bonaventer', suggests it was her name.'Parishes: St Veep - Zennor', Magna Britannia: volume 3: Cornwall (1814), pp. 317-329. Both emphasize her charm and intelligence. Thomasine was a native of Week St Mary, and is said to have paid for the repair of a bridge. There is no dispute that she founded a school and library there around 1510, which was much used by the people of Cornwall and to some extent Devon, until it was suppressed in the reign of Edward VI. A copy of her will, with which she endowed the school, was bound for a buyer overseas in 1972, when it was purchased for the British Library.Week St Mary, Cornwall, local historian According to one account Thomasine's first husband had the name Thomas Bumsby and her second Henry Gall. William Galle, tailor, and Henry Bumpstede, mercer, described as bridge masters of London Bridge, in records, were also business partners until Bumpstede died in 1486.Corporation of the City of London Collections On the Great Western Railway, locomotive no. 3354 (later no. 3342) of the 3300 class was named Bonaventura after Thomasine; it ran from 1900 to 1938.

The main scientific goal of GEMS was to be the first mission to systematically measure the polarization of cosmic X-Ray sources. GEMS would have provided data to help scientists study the shape of spacetime that has been distorted by a spinning black hole's gravity and the structure and effects of the magnetic fields around neutron stars. It was cancelled by NASA in June 2012 for potential cost overruns due to delays in developing the technology. GEMS was managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA, the United States space agency, at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The project was an astrophysics program reporting to NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) in Washington, D.C.. The spacecraft would have been launched on in July 2014 on a nine-month mission with a possible 15-month extension for a guest observer phase;GEMS, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, accessed 2011-05-23 but the mission was terminated at the Confirmation Review stage on May 10, 2012 due to expected cost overruns. Cancelled missions can be reinstatedfor example, NuSTAR was cancelled in 2006, but reinstated a year later and launched in June 2012.W. Graham - Orbital’s Pegasus successfully launches NASA’s NuSTAR spacecraft (June 13th, 2012) However, NuSTAR was not cancelled due to project overruns, but rather due to changes in the overall NASA budget, so the circumstances for cancellation were very different. Small missions of the Explorer program offer much flexibility and launch opportunities, and the lessons learned can be applied to the same missions goals, but on a different mission (compare, for instance, Vanguard 1 to Explorer 1). Several years later two new X-ray polarimetry missions won a NASA award to develop X-ray polarimetry missions.NASA Selects Proposals to Study Neutron Stars, Black Holes and More Mission Mission poster for the GEMS telescope The GEMS X-ray telescope was designed to indirectly measure the regions of distorted space around spinning black holes through a measurement of the polarization of X-rays emitted. It would have also probed the structure and effects of the magnetic fields around magnetars and other star remnants with magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than Earth's. GEMS could reveal: * How spinning black holes affect space-time and matter as it is drawn in and compressed by strong gravitational fields. * What happens in the very strong magnetic fields near pulsars and magnetars. * How cosmic rays are accelerated by shocks in supernova remnants. Current missions cannot do this because the required angular resolution is limited and magnetic fields are invisible. The detector in GEMS would have been a small chamber filled with gas. When an X-ray is absorbed in the gas, an electron carries off most of the energy, and starts out in a direction related to the polarization direction of the X-ray. This electron loses energy by ionizing the gas; the instrument measures the direction of the ionization track, and thereby the polarization of the X-ray. The GEMS detector readout will employ a time projection chamber to image the track. The GEMS instrument is about 100 times more sensitive than previous X-ray polarization experiments. Mission costs were capped at US$105 million (in Fiscal Year 2008 dollars), excluding the launch vehicle, but an independent confirmation review board at NASA claimed it would grow to an estimated $150 million, leading to cancellation of the mission. The cancellation of GEMS marks the end of a multi-year-long binge of cancellations and attempted cancellations of current and future missions: it was at the time the last funded future U.S. space telescope besides JWST. The cancellation of GEMS may have jeopardized the Pegasus XL launcher.D. Leone - Demise of GEMS May Cost Orbital 150 Jobs, Doom Pegasus (2012) - Space News (The Pegasus XL has successfully launched other small explorer missions) Project Status GEMS was one of six Small Explorer missions selected in May 2008 for the NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) Program Phase A study.NASA Selects Small Explorer Investigations for Concept Studies, NASA media release C08-029, 2008-05-29, accessed 2009-08-14 In June 2009, GEMS was chosen to be the second of these missions to go forward into Phase B, starting in October 2010 for a launch in April 2014. The project completed and successfully passed the Systems Requirements Review (SRR) Design review (US Government) in December 2010.NASA SMD Astrophysics Program Letter, NASA, 2011-04-28, accessed 2010-05-23 GEMS did not pass a confirmation review conducted on May 10, 2012, which effectively cancelled the project. The project team intended to appeal the cancellation. On June 7, 2012, NASA officially announced the cancellation of the GEMS project. The mission was supposed to launch in 2014 to study black holes and neutron stars, but external reviews found the project would likely exceed its budget. GEMS was supposed to hold at $119 million, not counting the rocket. NASA's astrophysics director, Paul Hertz, says the technology needed for the instrument took longer to develop than expected, and that drove up the price.NASA kills GEMS X-ray telescope, blames project's cost NASA continued studying X-ray polarimetry missions in 2015 for future Explorer program observatories.

Personal life and education Michael David \\"Mike\\" Sanders was born to parents Bruce David Sanders and Lynda Jean (Lamb) Sanders on March 19, 1967 in Kansas City, Missouri. His father retired from the United States Post Office after 38 years of service, promoted to the position of Tour Superintendent for downtown Kansas City, Missouri. Sanders' paternal grandfather, Archie David Sanders, served in the United States Army during World War II, stationed overseas as an airplane mechanic. Raised in Gladstone, Missouri, Sanders received his primary kindergarten - 12 education at Big Shoal School (elementary; Kansas City, Missouri), Antioch Middle School (Gladstone, Missouri), and Winnetonka High School (Kansas City, Missouri). Sanders served in the Army ROTC during college. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Sanders attended law school at The Ohio State University. After an initial semester at law school, Sanders took a leave of absence and volunteered for military service during the Gulf War. He was a commissioned officer in the United States Army, rising to the rank of First Lieutenant. Upon completing military service, Sanders resumed his legal studies and earned a Juris Doctorate from The Ohio State University - Moritz College of Law in 1994. Sanders and his wife Georgia Cardwell Sanders have two sons, John Michael and Patrick David. Career Assistant Jackson County, Missouri Prosecuting Attorney Sanders served as an assistant Jackson County, Missouri prosecuting attorney from 1994 to 1997. He served as a special prosecutor for the Jackson County Drug Task Force and was the lead attorney for D.A.R.T. (Drug Abatement Response Team). In 1995, Sanders received the Rookie Prosecutor of the Year award from the Jackson County Prosecutor's Office. That same year Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) named him the Top Prosecutor of the Year for the state of Missouri. MADD's Heartland Chapter also presented him the Law Enforcement Officer of the Year award. Jackson County, Missouri Prosecuting Attorney In private practice until 2002, Sanders ran for and was elected Jackson County Prosecutor. He was re-elected for a second term in 2004. Jackson County Executive In 2006, Sanders was elected Jackson County Executive defeating Charles Wheeler. Sanders was re-elected to second and third terms 2010 and 2014. Upon taking office in 2007, Sanders inherited a budget crisis of a $6.3 million shortfall in the County's General Fund — a deficit that threatened to shut down County operations. By overseeing cuts to the County budget each year, the County's finances were in order by the 2010 independent Jackson County Legislator audit. In his first inaugural address, Sanders quoted President Harry S Truman: \\"America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.\\" During his tenure as County Executive, Sanders pushed through several key reforms and special projects including passage of Jackson County's first-ever comprehensive Code of Ethics, reorganization of the COMBAT program, opening of a new Regional Correctional Center, completion of renovations saving the Jackson County Historic Truman Courthouse, adoption of an updated county charter, and implementation of the Kansas City Streetcar - Ride KC public transportation system. In 2008, Sanders was selected as one of just 24 elected officials from across the nation to be a fellow of the Aspen Institute-Rodel Fellowships in Public Leadership program. Founded in 1950, the Aspen Institute is an international nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C.that fosters enlightened leadership and open-minded nonpartisan dialogue. In 2015 after the loss of his father, Sanders resigned from office stating he wished to spend more time with his family and resume his legal career. Missouri Democratic Party Chairman Sanders served as the head of the Missouri Democratic Party from 2011 - 2013.

A high-level cadre of the Khmer Serei, a rightist militia formed to oppose the regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, In is remembered largely for an unsuccessful 1963 attempt to 'negotiate' directly with Sihanouk, resulting in his arrest and public execution by firing squad. Biography In was born in Kampong Trach, Kampot, into a farming family, and was the nephew of In Tam, a provincial governor and prominent Cambodian politician of the post- independence years. In studied engineering in Phnom Penh; like Tam, he was a member of the Democratic Party, a broadly leftist, pro-independence party that was absorbed into Sihanouk's Sangkum movement in the later 1950s. At some point In joined the Khmer Serei, an anti-communist and anti-monarchist guerrilla movement founded by the exiled politician Son Ngoc Thanh; the Khmer Serei operated largely in areas on the Thai and South Vietnamese borders, and were thought to be at least partly funded by the CIA. Sihanouk was later to describe In as \\"one of the right-hand men\\" of Son Ngoc Thanh.Norodom Sihanouk, My War with the CIA, 1972, p.116 Arrest Preap In's uncle, In Tam, is thought to have met with his nephew and offered assurances that In would be given safe-conduct to negotiate directly with Sihanouk in the National Assembly. Sihanouk was to describe In as mistakenly supposing he was to negotiate Sihanouk's \\"surrender\\", though this is likely to be an exaggeration. It seems that In put forward a proposal involving the return of Thanh to Cambodia, though whether this was a genuine coup plot or merely an amnesty for Thanh remains unclear.Prince Sihanouk and the New Order in Southeast Asia , declassified CIA staff study (ESAU XXVI), p.124 Preap In and an associate, Saing San (described as a chauffeur at the Royal Palace) were arrested in Takeo on 19 November 1963; they were brought to Phnom Penh and displayed in cages in public.Corfield, J. Khmers Stand Up! a history of the Cambodian government 1970-1975, CSAS, 1994, p.34 Although San was soon to be released, In was brought before the National Assembly, where he readily 'confessed' that his organisation, the Khmer Serei, was funded and controlled by the CIA with the intention of overthrowing Sihanouk. Sihanouk asked the assembly to decide In's fate, and interpreted the response as a demand for the death penalty.ESAU XXVI, p.126 He was then handed over to a military tribunal, who sentenced him to death; \\"in his case, I had no inhibitions in signing the death warrant\\", commented Sihanouk. The Preap In affair was used by Sihanouk to underline his rejection of American aid from 1963. Execution In was executed by firing squad at Trapeang Kraleung, Kampong Speu Province, in January 1964. The execution was filmed, and the fifteen-minute newsreel was shown in cinemas across Cambodia for a month prior to the main feature; many Cambodians were deeply shocked by the film, which remained in their memories for many years.Short, P. Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare, Henry Holt, 2005, p.156 As a result, Preap In is still remembered in Cambodia as a figure of opposition to the Sangkum: the current Cambodian Prime Minister, Hun Sen, has several times threatened to broadcast the film of In's execution as part of his ongoing public disagreements with Sihanouk.Hun Sen s’agace des critiques de l’entourage de l’ancien roi, Cambodge Soir, 05-Apr-2005 References Category:Cambodian anti-communists Category:People executed by Cambodia by firing squad Category:Filmed executions Category:1938 births Category:1964 deaths Category:People from Kampot Province Category:Democratic Party (Cambodia) politicians Category:Executed politicians Category:Executed Cambodian people ","title":"Preap In"},{"id":"23980844","text":"Hot Springs () is a fictional work by Stephen Hunter, published in 2000. Hot Springs is a novel telling about gangsters and gambling in U.S. city Hot Springs, Arkansas. It is the first novel in the series featuring Hunter's character Earl Swagger. It is summer 1946 and Earl Swagger, former Marine and recipient of the Medal of Honor, feels he is an angry man with nowhere to go in the post-war peace. But then he joins a new war, the one against organized crime, and in this hellish crucible rediscovers his courageous true self. Plot summary Right after the official ceremony of receiving the Medal of Honor in United States capital Washington, D.C., 1stSgt Earl Swagger (retired) is being approached by district attorney of Garland County Fred Becker and ex- FBI agent D. A. Parker. The two men propose him a new job in Hot Springs, Arkansas to fight against organized crime and finally end the gambling and corruption of the city. Swagger's mission is to train twelve young policemen into a \\"dream team\\" and instruct them during operations in city casinos. The mission is to close down all gambling places, preferably without hurting people. If violence becomes necessary, they are outfitted with custom .45 automatics, Thompson submachine guns, and Browning automatic rifles as well as 12 gauge shotguns and M1 Carbines. Soon after accepting the new job, Earl finds out that his wife June is pregnant. She doesn't support Earl's idea to work in Hot Springs and is afraid of him being killed. One of the \\"dream team\\" members, a young policeman Frenchy Short (who also has a critical but unseen role in Black Light) is a smart young man, who feels that he can be above and better than the others in the team. Several times he tries to do something better than the others but in the end fails. That way he once killed two men during an assassination in the casino. Luckily for him, these two men were known bandits and Frenchy became sort of a hero. Next time, while supposedly on vacation, Frenchy finds the central office of the gambling network and reveals his research results to Swagger and Parker. This results in Becker firing him from the team because of illegal way of gathering evidence (as Frenchy, in fact, broke into a telephone office to search the maps). An enraged Short promptly goes over to the other side. For a little favour, he informs the city boss Owney Maddox of everything related to the \\"dream team\\". On the other hand, during the holiday Short's \\"dream team\\" partner Carlo Henderson (later seen in Dirty White Boys) is asked by D. A. Parker to investigate Swagger's past and find out, how is Swagger so familiar with Hot Springs's landscape. Swagger has shown knowledge of the city several times, pointing out important nuances during the operations, however claims that he's never been to Hot Springs before. Parker suggests that Swagger has the death instinct, because Swagger always tries to get into action himself, without wearing the bulletproof vest. During the investigation, Henderson finds out that Swagger's brother was beaten a lot by their father, Charles Swagger, former sheriff of Polk County. Carlo's investigation ultimately leads him to the belief that Earl was responsible for his father's death. When he finally questions him on the subject, Earl reveals that he did not kill his father, but found him dying in Hot Springs. He took him out of there and faked the robbery that supposedly got him killed to protect his father's reputation (and his own as well). Sam Vincent, who at the time is assistant of attorney in Garland, Arkansas. briefly assists Henderson with the investigation. Vincent also appears in other Hunter's novels, such as Point of Impact and Black Light. In the meanwhile, the governor of Arkansas orders a Highway Patrol unit to confiscate all heavy weaponry and bulletproof vests from the team, leaving them only with their handguns. Several members decide to leave, leaving only seven men. Short suggests Maddox to make a trap for the \\"dream team\\", which results in seven of them dying, including old D. A. Parker. The sole survivors are Earl Swagger and Carlo Henderson. They are then being arrested by the police and later let go home, with no money paid and with the condition, that they never, ever return to Hot Springs. Soon after, Maddox is being arrested with the accusation of owning stolen artwork. He's freed from prison by the crew of assassins who ambushed the raid team, but Swagger finds them in a place called Hard Bargain Valley and uses his Marine Issue M1A1 Thompson to kill all of them in a savage protracted gunfight, including Owney Maddox. Swagger also finds out that Owney was the actual murderer of his father. In the meantime, Earl's wife, June is in hospital giving birth to their son, which doesn't appear to be easy because of an unusual position of the baby. The local doctor can't rescue both, the mother and the child, so Earl brings another doctor with him, who is black. The locals in the town, outraged that a black doctor has entered a white hospital and is assisting a white patient, form a lynch mob and approach the hospital. Earl, carrying three loaded .45's, confronts them and warns them that if a fight occurs, a lot of them will die. The mob backs off. June survives, and successfully gives birth to their son, Bob Lee Swagger. Other characters Additionally the plot features two real- life persons from that period: American gangster Bugsy Siegel who was a major driving force behind large-scale development of Las Vegas and his friend, Chicago Outfit courier Virginia Hill. Two other real-life persons appear briefly, and with their identities only hinted at. The first, a screenwriter named \\"Bill\\", shares a table with Humphrey Bogart at a Hollywood nightclub. This is actually William Faulkner, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, when he was working in the movie business. The second brief appearance is by a gay pool attendant named \\"Roy\\", whose full name is Roy Scherer, and who later became better known as Rock Hudson. Other real-life persons merely mentioned include Mickey Rooney, Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Dick Powell and Alan Ladd. Finally, Raymond Clinton, the owner of the Buick dealership in Hot Springs is mentioned twice. This is an allusion to a real individual, Roger Clinton who owned the Buick dealership in Hot Springs during this time period and, a few years later, married the widowed mother of former President Bill Clinton, eventually becoming future President Clinton's stepfather.

He began studies at the University of Wisconsin in 1920, but his father's death in an automobile accident in February 1921 led to the family's relocation to Arizona, where DeConcini's father had purchased some properties. Around 1928, DeConcini developed the Government Heights subdivision just south of the VA Hospital (now known as the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System) in Tucson, Arizona. He named the roads in the subdivision President and Lincoln streets and Washington, District and Columbia streets. In honor of President Abraham Lincoln and the U.S. capital Washington D.C.

The construction cost of the \\"White House\\" was reported to have reached 30 million yuan, nearly one third of the 100 million yuan annual fiscal income of the entire Yingquan district. Despite being popularly deemed the \\"White House\\" (), the building resembles the United States Capitol. In 2008, it was widely reported that Zhang Zhi'an (), the Communist Party chief of Yingquan District, nicknamed the \\"White House Party Chief,\\" had been suspended from his office on June 5, 2008, along several other officials. They were under investigation for the death of Li Guofu (), a businessman who acted as a whistleblower. In Beijing, Li Guofu had accused Zhang of corruption and abuse of power, and hoped that Yingquan District would reclaim the area as farmland. In August 2007, Li Guofu was arrested by the Yingquan government on corruption charges and imprisoned. Zhang interrogated Li, threatening his family, and extracted a confession from him. On March 13, 2008, just hours before he was scheduled to see a lawyer, Li Guofu was found hanged. Although his death was deemed a suicide, media reported that Li Guofu's body was bruised and his mouth was tightly shut, uncharacteristic of a suicide by hanging. On February 8, 2010, Zhang was found guilty of taking bribes, retaliation, and framing an innocent person, and was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.

She was one of the first women in American history to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled, Philosophy in a New Key. In 1960, Langer was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Life  Born Susanne Katherina Knauth, Langer was raised in Manhattan's West Side in New York. She was the daughter of Antonio Knauth, an attorney, and Else Uhlich, both emigrants of Germany. Though she was American born, Langer's primary language was German, as it was strictly spoken in her household throughout her youth, and her German accent remained her entire life. She was exposed thoroughly to creativity and art, most specifically through music. She was taught to play the cello and the piano, and she continued with the cello for the remainder of her life. As a girl, Langer enjoyed reciting the works of great poets as well as traditional children's rhymes and tales. This sparked her love for reading and writing, and she would often write her own poems and stories to entertain her younger siblings. Her love of nature began during the summers her family spent in their cottage on Lake George. She married William Leonard Langer, a fellow student at Harvard in 1921, and in the same year they took their studies to Vienna, Austria. They had two sons and moved back to Cambridge, Massachusetts before the couple divorced in 1942. She died July 17, 1985.  Education  Her early education included attendance at Veltin School for Girls, a private school as well as being tutored from home. In 1916, Langer enrolled at Radcliffe College. She earned the bachelor's degree in 1920 and continued with graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard, where she received the master's diploma in 1924 and the doctorate in 1926. She was a tutor in philosophy at Radcliffe from 1927 to 1942. She lectured in philosophy for one year at the University of Delaware and for five years at Columbia University (1945-1950). From 1954 to 1962 she taught at Connecticut College. She also taught philosophy at the University of Michigan, New York University, Northwestern University, Ohio University, Smith College, Vassar College, the University of Washington, and Wellesley College.  Philosophy  Susanne Langer's unexplored thesis revolving around the connection of consciousness and aesthetics as well as her unusual use of language in her writing ultimately caused her to be scrutinized by her fellow scholars. However, it led her to further explore the complexity and nature of human consciousness.Shelley, C 1998, 'Consciousness, Symbols and Aesthetics: A Just-So Story and its Implications in Susanne Langer's 'Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling', Philosophical Psychology, 11, 1, pp. 45-66, Philosopher's Index, EBSCOHost, viewed 4 April 2016. Langer's philosophy explored the continuous process of meaning-making in the human mind through the power of \\"seeing\\" one thing in terms of another. Langer's first major work is entitled, Philosophy in a New Key. It put forth an idea that has become commonplace today: that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one's world.Howard Gardner, \\"Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer\\" Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity, New York: Basic Books, pp. 48–54 Beginning with a critique of positivism, the work is a study of human thought progressing from semantic theory through philosophy of music, sketching a theory for all the arts. For Langer, the human mind \\"is constantly carrying on a process of symbolic transformation of the experiential data that come to it\\", causing it to be \\"a veritable fountain of more or less spontaneous ideas\\". Susanne Langer's distinction between discursive versus presentational symbols is one of her better known concepts.Hoffmann, Michael H. G., Geist und Welt – durch die Symbolisierungen der Kunst betrachtet, a review of Susanne K. Langer, Die lebendige Form menschlichen Fühlens und Verstehens (The living form of human feeling and understanding). Munich: Fink, 2000. , IASL Online, retrieved 2010-03-19. Discursive symbolization arranges elements (not necessarily words) with stable and context invariant meanings into a new meaning. Presentation symbolization operates independently of elements with fixed and stable meanings. The presentation cannot be comprehended by progressively building up an understanding of its parts in isolation. It must be understood as a whole. For example, an element used in one painting may be used to articulate an entirely different meaning in another. The same principle applies to a note in a musical arrangement—such elements independently have no fixed meaning except in the context of their entire presentation.Lachmann, Rolf (January 1998), From Metaphysics to Art and Back: The Relevance of Susan K. Langer's Philosophy for Process Metaphysics 26, Process Studies, pp. 107–125 Langer believed that symbolism is the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding.Littlejohn, Stephen W.; Foss, Karen A. (2008), Theories of Human Communication (9th ed.), Belmont, California: The Thomson Wadsworth Corporation, p. 105 As with Ernst Cassirer, Langer believed that what distinguishes humans from animals is the capacity for using symbols. While all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols, and language. Animals respond to signs, but stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex for humans. The perspective also is associated with symbolic communication where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of a cooperating group. Langer is one of the earliest philosophers who paid close attention to the concept of the virtual. Inspired by Henri Bergson's notions of matter and memory, she connected art to the concept of the virtual. For her, figuring out the space of an art work by its creator was no less than building a virtual world. She describes virtuality as \\"the quality of all things that are created to be perceived\\". For her, the virtual is not only a matter of consciousness, but something external that is created intentionally and existing materially, as a space of contemplation outside of the human mind. Langer sees virtuality as a physical space created by the artist, such as a painting or a building, that is \\"significant in itself and not as part of the surroundings\\". She particularly considers architecture not as the realization of a space for being, but its conceptual translation into virtuality for perceiving: \\"The architect, in fine, deals with a created space, a virtual entity.\\" In contrast to Bergson, for Langer, virtuality is tangible and can cause a contemplative interaction between humans and the machine.Susanne K. Langer, Feeling and Form (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953), 65 and 114–115. In her later years, Langer came to believe that the decisive task of her work was to construct a science and psychology based theory of the \\"life of the mind\\" using process philosophy conventions. Langer's final work, Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling represents the culmination of her attempt to establish a philosophical and scientific underpinning of aesthetic experience, relying on a three volume survey of a comprehensive set of relevant humanistic and scientific texts.  History of feeling  Langer's desire to study the mind and its connections with art was rooted in her theory that works of art are representations of human feeling and expression. This led Langer to construct a biological theory of feeling that explains that \\"feeling\\" is an inherently biological concept that can be connected to evolutionary genetics. In her essay, Mind, Langer goes into depth to connect the early evolution of man to how we perceive the mind today. She explains that early organisms underwent refinery through natural selection, in which certain behaviors and functions were shaped in order for them to survive. Langer describes the body's organs to all operate within a specific rhythm, and these rhythms must cooperate with one another to keep the organism alive. This development, Langer explains, was the beginning of the framework for the Central Nervous System, which Langer believed to be the heart of cognitive interactions among humans.  Rhetoric  Susanne Langer's work with symbolism and meaning has led to her association with contemporary rhetoric, although her influence in the field is somewhat debated.Lunsford, Andrea (1995). Reclaiming Rhetoric: Women in the Rhetorical Tradition. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 265–284. Langer established the use of symbols as the \\"epistemic unit of community\\", suggesting that all knowledge in a community is gained and built from shared symbol-systems within a given culture. Langer's concept regarding language and dialogue may be understood to imply that language does not simply communicate, but it produces symbols from which humans then create their own reality.Innes, Robert (2008). Susanne Langer in Focus: The Symbolic Mind. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press. Claimed support of this perspective comes from Langer's statement that \\"language is intrinsic to thinking, imagining, even our ways of perceiving\\".[9] According to Arabella Lyon, professor at State University of New York, Langer holds that meaning arises from the relationship between a community, its discourse, and the individual. Lyon suggests that Langer's work may be viewed as a contradiction to the comparatively traditional theories of Aristotle, by way of Langer's argument that discourse forms through sensory experiences shared between speaker and hearer, rather than through logic as advocated by the philosopher. Langer's epistemic view of symbolism and language, which further examines the motivation of the speaker, the influential aspects of language that affect people, and the relationship between the speaker and the community, are often reflected in aspects of modern rhetorical studies.  Influences  Poster with a quotation of Susanne Langer in Portuguese Langer's works were largely influenced by fellow philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Alfred North Whitehead. Whitehead, an English mathematician and philosophy professor, was Langer's professor at Radcliffe. Whitehead introduced Langer to the history of human thought, the origins of the modern world, and contemporary philosophy. He helped shape her perspective on these topics which she presented in her first text, The Practice of Philosophy. Throughout her career, Whitehead continued to influence her understanding of the complicated world of human thought which guided her to pursue a philosophical career. She shared Whitehead's belief in going beyond the limitations of scientific research and believed that along with the new- found thinking and ideas that had initiated the modern era in science and philosophy, the opportunity for a rebirth of philosophical creativity would arise. Langer dedicated Philosophy in a New Key to \\"Alfred North Whitehead, my great Teacher and Friend\\". Susanne Langer's other main influence was the German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. Cassirer was a neo-Kantianist who studied the field of theories of symbolization. Cassirer influenced much of Langer's ides in Philosophy in a New Key, where she stated that the creation of symbols is the essential activity of art, myth, rite, the sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. She stated, \\"It is a peculiar fact that every major advance in thinking, every epoch-making new insight, springs from a new type of symbolic transformation\\". She drew from Cassirer's view in her belief that art theory must be interdependent with a theory of mind.  Legacy  Susanne Langer had an influence in many fields: for example, she has been cited by psychologist Abraham Maslow in Motivation and Personality (1954), by urban planner Kevin A. Lynch in The Image of the City (1960), by inventor William J. J. Gordon in Synectics (1961), by anthropologist Clifford Geertz in The Interpretation of Cultures (1973), by art scholar Ellen Dissanayake in Homo Aestheticus (1992), and by digital media theorist Janet Murray in Hamlet on the Holodeck (1997).

It is the first game to be released in the Moto Racer series since 2002. The game features a number of different modes, but a large portion of the game centers on the \\"Moto GP\\" mode, in which the player competes against the AI in a number of different races on a variety of terrain. Gameplay The top screen of the Nintendo DS shows the race and the player's motorcyclist, while the bottom screen shows a map with the player's location on the track. In Moto Racer DS, the player races motorcycles in various settings in order to complete the game. The game has races on both dirt and paved roads, and contains a number of different game modes: Moto GP, Traffic, Supercross, and Freestyle. Moto GP makes up the core of the game, where the player races against the computer in a series of different races on pavement. A championship mode inside of Moto GP places the player in a tournament where to advance, they are required to place at a certain level. Multiple people can play each other in races through the multiplayer function in Moto GP. Traffic places the player on a busy street with oncoming traffic and tasks the player with making it around the circuit without hitting any of the cars on the road. A multiplayer version of Traffic pits two players against each other on the same track to see who can maneuver through traffic better. Freestyle requires the player to perform a series of motorcycle tricks in order to earn points and advance to the next level. Supercross forces the player to drive motorcycles on a dirt track in order to perform tricks. Reception Moto Racer DS received positive reception from critics, who noted its extensive content as its main factor for success; it received a score of 74.50% from GameRankings and 73 out of 100 from Metacritic. NintendoLifes Adam Scott Clark felt that it was a successful game for those interested in motorcycle video games, but suggested that more casual racing fans would be turned off by the game's difficult learning curve and suggested Mario Kart DS as a viable alternative. Pocket Gamer thought that the game had a few hitches, but noted that the game still had an excellent amount of content and that its side effects were mostly due to the game's attempts to be more of a simulation racing game.

Climate  The average annual temperature for Fengyang County is 14.9 °C, and the average annual precipitation is 904.4 mm. History  Pre-Ming Dynasty  During the Xia, Shang and early Zhou dynasties, the Dongyi peoples inhabited this area and were collectively known as the Huaiyi after the Huai River. During the late Western Zhou Period and the early Spring and Autumn period, the Dongyi became increasingly sinicized and formed their own states. During the late Spring and Autumn period, the once-powerful Dongyi state of Xu was pressured from all directions and destroyed through a series of wars with its neighbors, such as the Chu State and the Wu State. Another Dongyi State was the small Zhongli State, which was a part of the Huaiyi Confederation led by the State of Xu. Tombs belonging to the royalty of the Zhongli State were discovered in excavations between 2005 and 2008 near Fengyang. Eventually, the Huaiyi peoples were either pushed south or assimilated.  Ming Dynasty  Fengyang's best known historical site is linked with the name of the county's most famous native, Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398). Although coming from a poor family, he became an important rebel leader and, later, the founder of China's Ming Dynasty. Once entrenched as the Hongwu Emperor in the nearby Nanjing, he honored the memory of his father, Zhu Wusi (d. 1344), and his mother, Lady Chen, by posthumously raising them to imperial dignity, and building for them an imperial-style mausoleum, known as Ming Huangling (, literally, \\"Ming Imperial Mausoleum\\").Eric N. Danielson, \\"The Ming Ancestor Tomb \\". China Heritage Quarterly, No. 16, December 2008. The emperor even started building the new imperial capital, named Zhongdu () near his childhood hometown, but the project was eventually abandoned. The stone figures of the Huangling Mausoleum have survived, and have been re-erected at the original location, some south of the county seat (()).Huangling Mausoleum of the Ming Dynasty The mausoleum statuary and the remains of the capital-building project are protected as a national historic site known as \\"Zhongdu Imperial City of the Ming and the Imperial Mausoleum's Statuary\\" ().Zhongdu Imperial City of Ming and Stone Tablets in Imperial Mausoleum In 1370, existing counties in the area were merged into a new county, named Linhuai County.  Qing Dynasty  In 1754, Linhuai County was restructured into a new county called Fengyang County, which serves as the descendant of the modern Fengyang County.  Recent History  The county's borders are jurisdiction has changed numerous times since its Qing-era formation. In 1974, future Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was sent to Damiao, Fengyang County as part of Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Program. Here, he did manual labour throughout the day and studied for university, Li recounts his days in the county as \\"hard times\\". He rose up to the rank of Damiao's Communist Party branch secretary in 1976, before leaving for Peking University in 1978.  Economy  Fengyang County's natural resources include limestone, quartz, marble, vermiculite, and asbestos.

It started its activities in 1990, with its involvement within the Eureka PROMETHEUS Project. Since then the research group focused on vehicular applications. VisLab, directed by Alberto Broggi, undertakes basic and applied research, including the perception of the surrounding environment in vehicular applications using cameras and fusion with other sensors.Official website for VisLab Its researchers contribute to fields such as artificial vision, image processing, machine learning, neural networks, robotics, and sensor fusion. In 2009, eleven VisLab researchers started a spinoff company, named VisLab srl, to commercialize the results of their main researches. The University of Parma owned a share of 5%.In 2015, VisLab was acquired by Silicon Valley company Ambarella Inc., and about 30 researchers asked and then were hired by VisLab to staff their new Parma location. History In the early years, the research group formed by Broggi, Massimo Bertozzi and Alessandra Fascioli designed, realized, and tested an autonomous car known as ARGO. ARGO was a passenger car able to perceive the environment through the use of microcameras, analyze the surroundings, plan a trajectory, and drive itself on normal roads. It was tested in 1998 with a 2000+ km tour in Italy, dubbed MilleMiglia in Automatico. In this test the vehicle drove for more than 94% in automatic mode. It was the first test in the world to use off-the-shelf and low cost technology (a Pentium 200 MHz PC and two low-cost video-phone cameras) in normal conditions of traffic, environment, and weather. In 2005 a vehicle called TerraMax was able to successfully conclude the DARPA Grand Challenge; VisLab's vision system was its primary means of perception. In 2007 a new version of TerraMax qualified for the DARPA Urban Challenge, which was not completed due to a fault. In 2010 VisLab launched VIAC, the VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge, a 13,000 km test run for autonomous vehicles, from Italy to China. This was the first autonomous driving test on an intercontinental route; it lasted three months. On 12 July 2013 VisLab tested the BRAiVE vehicle in downtown Parma. BRAiVE successfully negotiating two-way narrow rural roads, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, speed bumps, pedestrian areas, and tight roundabouts. VisLab engineers activated the vehicle in Parma University Campus and stopped it in Piazza della Pilotta (downtown Parma): a 20 minutes run in a real environment, together with real traffic at 11am on a working day, that required absolutely no human intervention. On 31 March 2014 VisLab unveiled the new autonomous car, whose name is DEEVA, and which features more than 20 cameras, 4 lasers, GPS, KTM and IMU, and all sensors are hidden. Location VisLab is located in the University of Parma main campus, south of Parma, Italy.

It was bred specifically for racing in the nineteenth century, principally in Normandy in north-western France.  History  Ridden trotting races in France were first held at the Champ de Mars of Paris in 1806. Selective breeding of trotting racehorses began in Normandy in the latter half of the nineteenth century. It was based on the local Carrossier Normand, a now-extinct forerunner of the Norman Cob; other influences were from the American Standardbred, Hackney, Norfolk Trotter and Thoroughbred. A stud-book for was started in 1906; eligibility for registration was determined by performance. The breed received official recognition in 1922. In 1937 the stud-book was closed to horses not bred in France; a small number of registrations of cross-bred horses with Standardbred blood has since been permitted.  Characteristics  There is no breed standard for the French Trotter. It is compact and of medium size – usually between about 154 and at the withers – and is most often chestnut or bay. The shoulder is sloped and the sternum prominent. The facial profile is straight. Despite the influence of the American Standardbred, which is predominantly a lateral pacing breed, the French Trotter performs an ordinary diagonal trot. It has greater stamina and endurance than the Standardbred; it reaches maturity more slowly, but may have a longer life as a racer.  Use  Approximately one third of the foals born each year are eventually selected for racing. They may be raced either in harness to sulkies, or ridden; about ninety per cent of races are in harness. The principal French trotting races are the for ridden trotters, and the Prix d'Amérique for sulky racers. A few horses excel in both types of race; by 1995, four horses had won the top prize in both disciplines. The horses not selected as racers may be used for riding, for trekking, in show-jumping or for mounted hunting.

His widow's death, apparently from grief, is commemorated in a celebrated epigraph by his relative Sir Henry Wotton. Life Born about 1584, he was youngest of the three sons of George Morton of Eshere in Chilham, Kent, by Mary, daughter of Robert Honywood of Charing in the same county. His grandmother, when left a widow, remarried Sir Thomas Wotton, and became the mother of Sir Henry Wotton, who always called himself Albertus Morton's uncle. He was educated at Eton College, and was elected to King's College, Cambridge, in 1603, apparently by royal influence, but he did not graduate there. In July 1604 Wotton was appointed ambassador to Venice, and his nephew accompanied him as secretary. In 1609 Morton returned to England, and August 1613 he was talked of as minister to Savoy, but he met with a serious carriage accident in the same year, and he did not start until 12 May 1614. Before 22 December of the same year he was appointed clerk to the council, and had set off on his return from Savoy to take up the duties of his office before 6 April 1615. In April 1616 he went to Heidelberg as secretary to the Princess Elizabeth, wife of Frederick V, Elector Palatine. He was knighted on 23 September 1617, and saw little enough of the electress: his brother, writing in October 1618, says that he had returned at that time and was ill, and under the care of an Italian doctor. He may have given up his clerkship while with the electress but on 6 April 1619 he had a formal grant of the office for life. He collected subscriptions for the elector in 1620, and in December of the same year he took over £30,000 to the Protestant princes of Germany. He returned before 12 March in the following year. He resigned his place in 1623 in a fit of pique, on not being allowed to be present when the Spanish match was discussed. It was rumoured in April 1624 that he was to succeed Sir Edward Herbert as ambassador to France, and later that he had refused the appointment, which, Dudley Carleton wrote, was as strange as that it was offered to him. By this time under the patronage of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and before 26 July he was formally appointed to Paris. He was injured in November of the same year by a fall from his horse. Early in 1625 Sir George Calvert gave up the secretaryship of state for a substantial consideration, and Morton was sworn in at Newmarket in his place. He was elected Member of Parliament for the county of Kent and for the University of Cambridge (he had been seriously proposed for the provostship of King's College) in the parliament of 1625. Buckingham had written to the mayor of Rochester in his favour, and he chose to sit for Kent, but he died in November 1625, and was buried at Southampton, where he had property. Wotton wrote an elegy upon him. Morton married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Apsley, but left no issue. His widow died very soon after him, and Wotton wrote a celebrated epigram upon her death: \\"He first deceased, she for a little tried, to live without him, liked it not, and died\\". Morton was succeeded as secretary by Sir John Coke.

Therefore, it was also called the Yan Tai Mountain (literally, \\"Smoke Platform Mountain\\"), named after the Zhongzhou barbette (Zhongzhou Pao Tai, literally, \\"Zhongzhou Cannon Platform\\"). Because a salt warehouse was built there in Ming dynasty, the place was also called Cangqianshan (literally, \\"the mountain before the warehouse\\"), abbreviated to Cangshan, which is where the modern name comes from. * The Treaty of Nanking in 1842 listed Fuzhou (Fuchow) as one of the Five Ports of Treaty, which made Cangshan District become the historic district for consulates. In 1844-1903, there built consulates of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, Russia, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, etc. At the same time, many Christian churches, schools, hospitals, newspaper offices, western firms were built there.

Since the year 2005, because of the \\"transformation of the old district\\" project, some characteristic buildings were torn down and rebuilt, which triggered some social opposition.  Geography  *Cangshan District is located in the south part of downtown Fuzhou, including entire Nantai Island, and a few sand islands on the Min River. Cangshan District is next to Gulou District, Taijiang District, Jin'an District, Mawei District, Changle District and Minhou County. The area of Cangshan District is about 142 square kilometres. *Cangshan District is surrounded by the Min River main branch (or north branch) and the Wulong River (the Min River south branch). The Min River (main branch) and Wulong River converge on Mawei District and ultimately flows to the Taiwan Strait. *There are plenty of mountains and hills in Cangshan District, e.g. Gaogai Mountain, Chang'an Mountain, Yantai Mountain, etc. In the centre of the former urban area (i.e. Cangshan proper), there were full of plum blossoms and therefore the road is today known as the Meiwu Road (literally, \\"plum blossom hollow road\\"). People used to visit there annually to enjoy the plum blossoms, which was an important annual event.

History Prior to inception, Templeton was unable to decide on either \\"Toy Skateboards\\" or \\"Machine Skateboards\\" for a company name—friend and fellow professional skateboarder Ethan Fowler suggested a combination of the two propositions. Some of the skateboarders who joined the company during its early period were Brian Anderson, Elissa Steamer, and Brad Staba; however, all three quit the company at the same time. Austin Stephens then joined the team, followed by Caswell Berry, Diego Bucchieri, and Josh Harmony. Stephens, the longest- serving the team member aside from Templeton, retired from professional skateboarding in December 2013. The company released a tribute skateboard deck to commemorate Stephens's career and Templeton officially stated 2010: > I recall Austin coming to me at the Toy Machine Halloween demo a few years > back saying that he didn’t think he could do it anymore. And I said, “Do > what?” and he said, “Skateboard.

Life Early life and education Mai-Bornu was born in the town of Yola to parents of Kanuri heritage. His father was a councillor in the Lamido Native Authority and initially opposed Mai-Bornu's attendance of school until he was persuaded by the Lamido to give Mai-Bornu a chance. Mai-Bornu attended Yola Elementary School, Yola Middle School, and was admitted to Kaduna College in 1938, graduating in 1942 as an English language teacher. He started his teaching career at his alma mater, Yola Middle School from 1942–1946 before proceeding to another one of his alma mater's, Kaduna College (1946–1952) and soon joined the Northern Teachers Association. In 1952, he returned to Yola as deputy headmaster of the Yola Middle School and later left Yola to be a House Tutor at the Veterinary School in Vom for five months. He earned a government scholarship to travel abroad and studied Economics at Bristol University in the United Kingdom graduating in 1957. Career Mai-Bornu returned to Nigeria and obtained a post as Administrative Officer with the Northern Nigeria Public Service (1957–1959) serving in the Public Service Commission and Ministry of Finance and Trade. When the Central Bank started operations in 1959, he was seconded to the Central Bank of Nigeria as an Assistant Secretary. He rapidly rose through the ranks from assistant secretary to deputy secretary, then secretary. In 1962, he became the first Nigerian to be appointed Deputy Governor. On July 25, 1963, Mai-Bornu was appointed Governor of the Central Bank (1963–1967). After leaving the bank, he was appointed Director and General Manager of the Nigerian Tobacco Company (1967–1969).

It provides guidance information that can be used to guide an unmanned vehicle during rendezvous and docking operations in space. TriDAR does not rely on any reference markers positioned on the target spacecraft. Instead, TriDAR relies on a laser based 3D sensor and a thermal imager. TriDAR's proprietary software uses the geometric information contained in successive 3D images to match against the known shape of the target object and calculate its position and orientation. TriDAR made its inaugural demonstration space flight on board Space Shuttle Discovery on the STS-128 mission, launched on 28 August 2009. On STS-128, TriDAR provided astronauts with real-time guidance information during rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station (ISS). It automatically acquired and tracked the ISS using only knowledge about its shape. This marked the first time a 3D sensor based \\"targetless\\" tracking vision system was used in space. Background To date, most operational tracking solutions for pose estimation and tracking on-orbit have relied on cooperative markers placed on the target object(s). The Space Vision System (SVS) used black on white or white on black dot targets. These targets were imaged with Space Shuttle or International Space Station (ISS) video cameras to compute the relative pose of ISS modules to be assembled. The Trajectory Control System (TCS) is currently used on board the space shuttle to provide guidance information during rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station (ISS). This laser-based system tracks retro reflectors located on the ISS to provide bearing, range and closing rate information. While reliable, target based systems have operational limitations as targets must be installed on target payloads. This is not always practical or even possible. For example, servicing existing satellites that do not have reflectors installed would require a targetless tracking capability. STS-128 TriDAR during STS-128 TriDAR was tested for the first time in Space on board Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-128 mission to the ISS. The objective of the test was to demonstrate the capability of the TriDAR system to track an object in space without using targets markers such as retro-reflectors. For this mission, TriDAR was located in the payload bay on the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) next to the Shuttle's Trajectory Control System (TCS). The system was activated during rendezvous when the Shuttle was approximately away from the ISS. Once in range of the 3D sensor, TriDAR automatically determined bearing and range to the ISS. During rendezvous, TriDAR entered shape based tracking which provided full 6 degree of freedom guidance and closing rate. Key system information was provided in real-time to the crew via enhanced docking displays on a laptop computer located on the shuttle's crew compartment. The system was designed to perform the entire mission autonomously. It self- monitored its tracking solution and automatically re-acquired the ISS if tracking had been lost. TriDAR was also tested during undocking and fly-around operations. STS-131 TriDAR during STS-131 TriDAR was again carried on board Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission to the International Space Station. The TriDAR operated during shuttle rendezvous with the ISS, and acquired useful data up till the shuttle R-bar Pitch Maneuver. At that point, a cabling issue resulted in a loss of communications. Using a backup cable for undock and flyaround, the TriDAR operated \\"flawlessly\\", according to flight director Richard Jones. STS-135 TriDAR was on board Space Shuttle Atlantis during the STS-135 mission to the International Space Station. Capabilities TriDAR builds on recent developments in 3D sensing technologies and computer vision achieving lighting immunity in space vision systems. This technology provides the ability to automatically rendezvous and dock with vehicles that were not designed for such operations. The system includes a 3D active sensor, a thermal imager and Neptec's model based tracking software. Using only knowledge about the target spacecraft's geometry and 3D data acquired from the sensor, the system computes the 6 Degree Of Freedom (6DOF) relative pose directly. The computer vision algorithms developed by Neptec allow this process to happen in real-time on a flight computer while achieving the necessary robustness and reliability expected for mission critical operations. Fast data acquisition has been achieved by implementing a smart scanning strategy referred to as More Information Less Data (MILD) where only the necessary data to perform the pose estimation is acquired by the sensor. This strategy minimizes the requirements on acquisition time, data bandwidth, memory and processing power. Hardware The TriDAR sensor is a hybrid 3D camera that combines auto-synchronous laser triangulation technology with laser radar (LIDAR) in a single optical package. This configuration takes advantage of the complementary nature of these two imaging technologies to provide 3D data at both short and long range without compromising on performance. The laser triangulation subsystem is largely based on the Laser Camera System (LCS) used to inspect the Space Shuttle's thermal protection system after each launch. By multiplexing the two active subsystem's optical paths, the TriDAR can provide the functionalities of two 3D scanners into a compact package. The subsystems also share the same control and processing electronics thus providing further savings compared to using two separate 3D sensors. A thermal imager is also included to extend the range of the system beyond the LIDAR operating range. Applications Scarab lunar rover Because of its wide operating range, the TriDAR sensor can be used for several applications within the same mission. TriDAR can be used for rendezvous and docking, planetary landing, rover navigation, site and vehicle inspection. TriDAR's capabilities for planetary exploration have been demonstrated recently during field trials in Hawaii held by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). For these tests, TriDAR was mounted on Carnegie Mellon University's Scarab lunar rover and enabled it to automatically navigate to its destination. Once the rover arrived at its destination, TriDAR was used to acquire high resolution 3D images of the surrounding area, searching for ideal drill sites to obtain lunar samples. TriDAR applications are not limited to space. TriDAR technology is the basis of Neptec's OPAL product. OPAL provides vision to helicopter crews when their vision has been obscured by brownouts or whiteouts. TriDAR technology can also be applied to numerous terrestrial applications such as automated vehicles, hazard detection, radiotherapy patient positioning, assembly of large structure as well as human body tracking for motion capture or video game controls.

He joined HMS Britannia as a Naval Cadet in 1882. In 1884 he was promoted Midshipman and joined the composite screw corvette HMS Opal on the Cape of Good Hope and West Africa Station. He was commissioned Sub-Lieutenant in 1889 and promoted Lieutenant in 1892. In 1897 he took command of HMS Hardy, one of the first destroyers, at Portsmouth. Five years later, he was on 1 July 1902 posted as first lieutenant on the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Resolution, serving in the Channel Fleet. He was promoted Commander in 1903. In 1905 he took command of the scout cruiser HMS Sentinel in the Mediterranean. While there he escorted HMY Victoria and Albert during King Edward VII's visit to Malta and was appointed Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO). In 1907 he was appointed naval attaché in Paris, and later served in the same capacity in Madrid, Lisbon and Brussels until 1911. He was promoted Captain in 1908. In February 1914 he became Assistant Director of the Naval Intelligence Division at the Admiralty in London. In April 1915 he took command of the battlecruiser HMS Inflexible. At the Battle of Jutland in 1916 the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron flagship, HMS Invincible, was hit and blew up, but Heaton-Ellis led the squadron forwards past the wreck of the flagship so brazenly that the Germans thought the Inflexible must be the leading ship of the British battle fleet and swerved away. For these services he was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In November 1916, Heaton-Ellis was appointed chief of staff to Rear-Admiral Sir William Pakenham, commanding the Battlecruiser Squadron, in HMS Lion. In August 1917 he was appointed Naval Liaison Officer in Paris with the rank of Commodore. He was promoted Rear- Admiral in October 1919 and retired a few months later, although he was promoted Vice-Admiral on the retired list in 1925. Heaton-Ellis was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1919 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours. He was president of the Navigators' and Engineer Officers' Union from 1937 and superintendent of the Watts Naval School in Norfolk from 1939 to 1941. Both of his sons were killed in the First World War.

The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1858. It is found throughout temperate North America ranging from New York and Pennsylvania west to Montana, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arizona and into Texas, and north to southern Illinois, extreme southern Alberta and Saskatchewan; it has also been recorded west of the Rocky Mountains from California and south-eastern British Columbia. It is typically found near water, where the food plants of its caterpillar larvae grow plentifully. Description and ecology Upperside pattern of imago of the typical form The wingspan is 70–75 mm or more. The forewings are grayish to brownish with prominent black bands above, and whitish below. The upperside of the hindwings is orange red, with two roughly concentric blackish bands on each wing and lacking hairs at the base. The outer band separates a margin that is lighter in color than the rest of the upper hindwing. The inner band does not reach the trailing edge; its hindward tip forms a hook which points back at the wing base or almost so. The underside of the hindwings is whitish along the leading edge; the trailing three-quarters of the wing are orange red. The inner black band is present on the underwings also. As in many relatives, the foreleg tibia of this species possess no spines, while the tarsi carry three rows of spines.Nelson & Loy (1983) Adults are on the wing from June to September depending on the location. There is probably one generation per year. The caterpillars feed on willow species (Salix) and - in the west of their range - Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii). Classification This moth is placed in the subfamily Catocalinae, either of the owlet moth family, Noctuidae, or - if the Noctuidae are circumscribed more strictly - of family Erebidae. Within the Catocalinae, it belongs to tribe Catocalini and – if the Noctuidae are circumscribed widely – subtribe Catocalina. This species is probably related to other North American willow – and cottonwood – feeding Catocala. If so, it is one of the rather few species of this radiation that ranges east of the Rocky Mountains. Synonyms In the past, the name Catocala aspasia has often been used for this species, but actually it seems to refer to the rather similar C. electilis.See references in Savela (2012) Imago of the augusta form from above Many taxa described as distinct species or subspecies have recently been merged with C. junctura and are considered mere forms without taxonomic rank; the alternate vernacular name \\"Stretch's underwing\\" in fact refers to one of these, the former C. stretchii. Not all authors have already adopted these changes, which are probably warranted however.

It was aired on CBS on November 23, 1993. It is set in Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico. Plot A couple of student nurses decide to join some doctors to work in a medical station in the rain-forest a few hours flying-time from the Mexican town Catemaco. As they fly from Catemaco towards the clinic (which actually consists of just a few huts and almost no equipment) one of their three planes goes down because of engine malfunction. It crashes somewhere in the middle of the jungle causing bad injuries to the passengers. The following day describes the attempts by the passengers to save their own lives in spite of the few poor chances they seem to have. There is almost no medicine available, the supplies they brought with them were all on the plane going down and were stolen by native drug-dealers when they arrived at the site of the crash first. In the afternoon they decide to take the injured to a nearby village with a runway long enough that the Learjet of the Californian Air Rescue team could take them to a clinic in the U.S. Not only is the journey there very complicated (one of the injured could pass away any minute) but it may also be futile: due to recent anti-drug operations no plane is allowed to fly after dark, so the Air Rescue Team is not able to get clearance for their mission. Dr. Daniel Perrin sets off to Catamaco to persuade the authorities into giving their permission for the flight while the rest is trying to get to the runway by dawn.

Football career Born in Padiham, he played his entire career with Lancashire clubs. Bradshaw played for Accrington Stanley before joining Football League First Division side Blackburn Rovers in 1909. However, he did not make a senior appearance for the club and returned to non- League football with Nelson. After a spell with hometown club Padiham, Bradshaw was signed by nearby First Division outfit Burnley in June 1911. Bradshaw was unable to properly break into the first team at Turf Moor and made only one league appearance in the 1911–12 season, covering for left- winger Jack Harris in the 1–0 win against Nottingham Forest on 10 February 1912. He started the first game of the following campaign, but despite the team beating Glossop 2–1 he was dropped for the next match along with Tommy Boyle, Jack Picken and Eddie Mosscrop. After almost seven months in the reserves, Bradshaw returned to the starting line-up for five of the last six fixtures of the season. He remained with Burnley for another year but played just one more senior match, deputising for Billy Watson in the 3–1 defeat at Newcastle United. After being released by Burnley in the summer of 1914 Bradshaw had a second spell Padiham, although he did return to Turf Moor to play twice for the Clarets as a guest player during the First World War.

History  The SUI was founded as the Speleological Society of Ireland in 1964 to promote speleology (the scientific study of caves) in Ireland. Jack Coleman was the first president. The society was reconstituted in 1983 as the Speleological Union of Ireland. In 2002 the SUI was set up as a limited company.  Functions  The SUI provides training for cave leaders and new cavers and represents cavers' interests in disputes with landowners. It also works to protect Irish caves from damage by human influence, including dumping, quarrying, development, and promotes a strong conservation ethic to cavers. The organisation promotes awareness of caves and safe caving, providing information for beginners wishing to try caving. The SUI publishes a scientific journal, Irish Speleology, and grant aid is often provided by the organisation for international caving expeditions. In August 2012 the Kozłowski Fund was additionally set up to support cave exploration within Ireland, in memory of prolific cave diver and explorer Artur Kozłowski. The SUI, in conjunction with the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation, organises an annual symposium for Irish cavers. It has been held every year since 1985.

The population was included in the 2011 census with that of Tamworth, about to the north. History The name Wigginton is believed to come from Old English, and to mean Wicga's farm. The name was also sometimes written as Wiggington. The village lies on a medieval trade route, the Portway, possibly used for transporting salt from the River Mease at Edingale to Tamworth. Ecclesiastically, Wigginton had been a chapelry attached to the parish of St Editha in Tamworth. For civil government it had been a township – the township was more than just the village, and included the hamlets of Comberford and Coton, the latter now part of the borough of Tamworth. In 1866 the township became a civil parish, and in 1894 part of Tamworth Rural District. In 1934 the civil parish was extended to become Wigginton and Hopwas, and became part of Lichfield Rural District. In 1861 the population of Wigginton township was 670, on . This figure included inmates of the Tamworth workhouse, which at that time lay within the township. The population of the chapelry alone was 466. Landmarks Grade II listed buildings in Wigginton village include two or three houses and the former Anglican chapel, now a church. Dedicated to St Leonard, it was rebuilt in 1777, extended in 1830, and altered again in 1861 to a design by Nicholas Joyce.Church of St Leonard. Situated within the modern village is a shrunken medieval village, visible as a series of pronounced earthworks to the northern end of the village, and medieval ridge and furrow still to be seen in surrounding fields. To the south-west of the village is the former site, now ploughed out, of a likely Bronze Age barrow formerly known as \\"Robin Hood's Butt\\". Several finds of archaeological interest have been made in the area around the village. To the north-west is a flat area formerly called the \\"Money Lands\\", where human bones and ancient coins, thought to be Roman, were recovered in a find made in the 18th century. Amenities The village contains a pub, the Old Crown, and a Church of England primary school, St Leonards. The pub called The Wigginton is over the border in Tamworth, as is Wigginton Park, the home of Tamworth RUFC.

He is known for redefining Total Design (methodology), which had previously been coined by Ove Arup regarding integrated architecture and structural engineering, to instead map a structured and integrated process in the field of product design and development that included market and production processes. Biography Stuart Pugh was a design engineer and manager. His experience in industry led him to pursue a secondary career in academia, where he published on 'Total Design'. Stuart Pugh graduated from London University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and became a graduate apprentice for the British Aircraft Corporation. In 1956 he worked in the Warton Aerodrome as a project engineer for the Mach 6 Wind Tunnel. In 1963 he became the Chief Designer of the Mechanical Product Division at the Marconi Company. In the later stages of his industrial career, Pugh worked within the English Electric Company as Chief Designer in the Hydraulic Equipment Division, ultimately progressing to become Divisional Manager. Pugh left industry in 1970 and began his academic career as a 'Smallpeice' Reader in Design for Production at Loughborough University of Technology. Later, he became the Director of the 'Engineering Design Centre'. Pugh moved to Scotland and in 1985 became the 'Babcock Professor of Engineering Design' and the head of the 'Design Division' at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. It was here that Pugh produced his seminal book, 'Total Design: Integrated Methods for Successful Product Engineering’, published in 1990. Pugh Introduced and taught Total Design across the faculty of engineering at Strathclyde University. He ran multidisciplinary design classes which included students of architecture and law. He also contributed to the MBA program and taught short courses on Total Design to Industrial managers. Soon after Pugh published his book 'Total Design', Professor Don Clausing (MIT) and Professor Ken Ragsdell (University of Missouri) encouraged Pugh to publish his collection of papers to make his work readily available to design engineers and managers. However, Pugh's untimely death from illness ultimately led Don Clausing and Ronaldo Andrade (Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) to complete Pugh's book 'Creating Innovative Products Using Total Design: The Living Legacy of Stuart Pugh’. Total Design  Definition of Total Design  “Total Design is the systematic activity necessary, from the identification of the market/user need, to the selling of the successful product to satisfy that need – an activity that encompasses product, process, people and organisation.” – Stuart PughPugh 1991, p. 5. The design process previous to the total design methodology was very much ad hoc which Pugh described as ‘partial design’. Engineers and designers focused on their part within the total design of a product, rarely becoming part of the full product development process. This often led to commercial failure, due to the lack of consideration of the market, the user needs and the resources of the organisation (non-technological factors). Total design offers a visible operational structure which allows for the integration of technological and non-technological parts enabling efficient and effective product development. Design Activity Model “Total design may be construed as having a central core of activities, all of which are imperative for any design, irrespective of domain. Briefly, this core, the design core, consists of market (user need), product design specification, conceptual design, detail design, manufacture and sales. All design starts, or should start, with a need that, when satisfied, will fit into an existing market or create a market of its own.” – Stuart Pugh The design core separates the design process into six iterative stages. This structure enables the seamless flow of information between stages while enabling the formation of multi-disciplined project teams. Product Design Specification (PDS) \\"From the statement of the need – often called the brief – a product design specification (PDS) must be formulated – the specification of the product to be designed. Once this is established, it acts as the mantle or cloak that envelopes all the subsequent stages in the design core. The PDS thus acts as the control for the total design activity, because it places the boundaries on the subsequent designs.\\" – Stuart Pugh A PDS is a dynamic document that evolves during the design process. At the end of the design activity the design must be in balance with the final version of the PDS. Pugh devised a structure for a PDS that has 34 elements, however some elements may not be applicable to certain projects. Concept Selection – Method of Controlled Convergence Pugh's most famous work, \\"Concept Selection – A Method that Works\\",S. Pugh (1981) Concept selection: a method that works. In: Hubka, V. (ed.), Review of design methodology. Proceedings international conference on engineering design, March 1981, Rome. Zürich: Heurista, 1981, blz. 497 – 506. describes Pugh's innovative 'controlled convergence' technique that was put to the test so successfully for General Motors' Saturn project. \\"A major advantage of controlled convergence over other matrix selection methods is that it allows alternative convergent (analytic) and divergent (synthetic) thinking to occur, since as the reasoning proceeds and a reduction in the number of concepts comes about for rational reasons, new concepts are generated.\\" – Stuart PughPugh 1991, p. 74. The \\"Pugh method\\" of concept selection is a form of decision matrix, associated with the QFD method. It is implemented by establishing an evaluation team and constructing the matrix which contains evaluation criteria versus alternative concepts. A baseline concept is selected and the other concepts are scored against the criteria relative to the baseline. The scoring is done in symbol form, of either a positive, negative or neutral scoring. The scores are then combined to give a numerical output for each concept, the highest score being the most compatible. Publications Books *Stuart Pugh, Don Clausing, Ron Andrade, (24 April 1996).

It was originally built for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system, and was launched in June 1978. It is positioned in geostationary orbit, from where it was initially used for weather forecasting in the United States. Since ceasing to function as a weather satellite in 1989, it has been used as a communications satellite, and has spent over thirty-eight years in operation. GOES-3 was decommissioned 29 June 2016 at the CSTARS facility in Miami, Florida. GOES-3 was built by Ford Aerospace, and is based on the satellite bus developed for the SMS programme. At launch it had a mass of . Launch GOES-C was launched using a Delta 2914 carrier rocket flying from Launch Complex 17B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 10:49 GMT on 16 June 1978, just two minutes short of a year after the previous satellite, GOES-2. Orbit GOES-C on a Delta 2914 before launch The launch successfully placed GOES-C into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, from which it raised itself to geostationary orbit using an onboard SVM-5 apogee motor. Its insertion into geosynchronous orbit occurred at 03:22 on 17 June. GOES-C underwent on-orbit testing, and was subsequently redesignated GOES-3. It replaced GOES-1 in service, and was initially operated at 135° West. In 1981, it was moved to 90° West, arriving in 1982, before departing again in 1984. In 1985 it arrived back at 135° West. In 1987 it was moved to 129° West, where it operated until it became unusable for meteorological studies in 1989. After ceasing operations as a weather satellite, GOES-3 was reassigned for use as a communications satellite. In 1990, it was relocated to 175° West, and in 1995 it was moved again, and has been stationed between 102° and 110° West since 1996. Organisations which have used GOES-3 for communications include Peacesat, who used it to provide communications services to islands in the Pacific Ocean; the University of Hawaii who used it to broadcast educational programmes; the US National Science Foundation, who use it for communications with the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station; and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.

Şirince () is a village of 600 inhabitants in İzmir Province, Turkey, located about east of the town Selçuk and about 8 kilometres from Ephesus. The area around the village has history dating back to Hellenistic period (323-31 BC). Pottery finds made around the village between 2001 and 2002 by Ersoy and Gurler indicate the presence of seven villages and nine farmsteads in the area dating back to ancient and medieval times. On the road up you will see the remains of several Roman aqueducts as the village was an important water source for ancient Ephesus. Today the village prospers through agriculture (olive oil, peaches, wine) and tourism. It is well protected and a rare and attractive example of Ottoman Christian archtectiture.  History in Ottoman times  Şirince prospered when Ephesus was abandoned in the 15th century but most of what one sees today dates from the 19th century. There is a story that the village was settled by freed Greek slaves who named the village (meaning \\"Ugly\\" in Turkish) to deter others from following them.Turkey. Lonely Planet, 8th edition, p. 252. There is an alternative suggestion made by Cahit Tecli that the village takes its name from the nomadic Turcoman tribe which appears in Ottoman registers as Cirkin, Cirkinlu, Cirkinoglu, Cirkitali and Cirkitulu. (The village's name was changed to (meaning \\"Pleasant\\") in 1926 by the governor of Izmir Province.) According to an Ottoman account from 1650 there were only 18 tax paying individuals in Cirkince, all of whom were Orthodox Christians. In 1699 an English priest, Edmund Chishull visited the village and says that the whole population was Christian. A nineteenth century visitor, Arundell, who came to the village twice in 1832 and 1833, states \\"the village is a considerable one, of at least 300 houses, all Greek: the principal language of the village in Turkish, though they know something of their own tongue\\". He notes that the women \\"dressed in the Turkish manner, covering their faces\\"....and the men \\"all armed as the Turks, with pistols and yatagan (a type of long knife) and are renowned for having killed a lot of pirates from the island of Samos\\". He estimated the population as \\"probably fifteen hundred persons\\". The village was a successful agricultural community growing vines, tobacco, figs, olives and vegetables. They had sheep goats, dairy cows and bee hives. By 1908/1909 the yearbook (Salname) states that the village had more than 1,000 houses, all inhabited by Greek Orthodox Christians. \\"Their mother tongue is Turkish and they speak it with an ancient dialect\\". The Ottoman administration in the area continued until 1919 when the invading Greek army took control and remained in charge until 1922.  The Population Exchange  The final and drastic change in the area came with the population exchange between Greece and the newly established Turkish Republic, although many of the inhabitants had already fled. The Muslims who came were from Greece, they had no experience in growing figs or olives, only tobacco. As a result many cut down the olive and fruit trees for firewood or sold them. The incomers spoke Greek and so integration with the local Muslim population took time. As Sirince declined Selcuk began to prosper. Until the 1950s the population of Sirince remained at 2,000- 3,000 but families increasingly moved to Selcuk.  House of Mary  A building known as the House of Mary (Ottoman Turkish: پناغى قپىلى Panaya Kapulu), about 17 km outside of Şirince, is venerated by Catholic Christians as well as Muslims. The Christians, descended from the first churches in Ephesus, had a tradition of venerating the building long before foreigners tracked it down in 1881 (using descriptions seen by Bl. Anne Catherine Emmerich in a vision).Poulin, Eugene P., \\"The Holy Virgin's House: The True Story of Its Discovery\\", Istanbul: 1999Chronicle of the living Christ: the life and ministry of Jesus Christ by Robert A. Powell 1996 page 12  Restoration projects A view of ŞirinceIn the 1990s the well-known Istanbul linguist Sevan Nişanyan and his wife Müjde Tönbekici settled in Şirince, which was semi-derelict. They were instrumental in having the village declared a national heritage site, and they undertook to renovate ruined historic houses using the original materials and building techniques of the village. Several of the renovated village houses were eventually converted into a highly acclaimed Hotel de Charmehttp://www.chateauxhotels.com/ by the name of the Nisanyan Houses.http://nisanyan.com/? Since then many villagers have restored their homes and operate them as small hotels and guest houses. There is accommodation to suit every pocket and the village is well served with many restaurants.  Mathematical Village  Nisanyan also built Thethre Madrasa (in Turkish Tiyatro Medresesi), a theater institute and actors’ retreat in the manner of mediaeval Muslim seminaries. The Nisanyan Memorial Library was completed in 2013. Nişanyan also cooperated with Ali Nesin, a prominent mathematician and philanthropist to build the Nesin Mathematics Village near Şirince. Constructed strictly along the lines of traditional Aegean rural architecture, the village offered summer courses in college-level and postgraduate mathematics. It attracted prominent lecturers from around the world, accommodating over 300 resident students by summer 2013. A philosophy school became operative on the grounds of Mathematics Village in 2014. Doomsday safe haven Şirince acquired world-wide fame when tourists flocked to the village in December 2012 to witness the Mayan Apocalypse, as New Age mystics believed its \\"positive energy\\" would aid in weathering the catastrophe, during the 2012 phenomenon.

The main advantage of this type of pump is that it prevents clogging of the pump itself and of the adjacent piping, as all the solids and stringy materials are macerated by the chopping system. Chopper pumps exist in various configurations, including submersible and dry-installed design and they are typically equipped with an electric motor to run the impeller and to provide torque for the chopping system. Due to its high solids handling capabilities, the chopper pump is often used for pumping sewage, sludge, manure slurries, and other liquids that contain large or tough solids.  History  200pxThe chopper pump was invented in 1950 by the Danish company Landia. The pump manufacturer, Christian Ølgaard, developed a pump with a special knife system to meet the need for macerating and pumping manure in agricultural applications. Manure with high solids content, containing straw and sawdust, would clog up other types of pumps, causing unstable operation in an environment which required high reliability. As the need for the pumping of difficult media expanded to other industries, so did the use of the chopper pump in both dry and submersible applications and in various industries, including meat, paper and food processing, as well as the automobile industry, biogas, chemical plants, municipal wastewater and prison lift stations.  Working principle  A chopper pump is operated by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, power takeoff (PTO)), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump should not be confused with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.  Applications  Examples of applications where chopper pumps are commonly applied include: * Scum pumping at wastewater treatment plants * Sewage wet wells and lift stations; especially sewage containing wet wipesPollution Solutions Online * Sludge pumping at biogas facilities Carolyn J.

It starred Russell Tovey, Kate O'Flynn, Sorcha Cusack and Gerard Horan. Overview The plot follows the struggle of a teenage single mother, Amy Aston, to bond with her unwanted baby daughter Cara in rural Norfolk. Amy works at a chicken factory whilst her grandmother, Val, looks after the child. The young mother begins a tumultuous relationship with Gary Trudgill, a violent and traumatised soldier on sick leave from the Army. Gary's outbursts, in part a response to the treatment he receives from his own father, Rob, threaten to harm the child. The play ends on a potentially helpful note, with baby Cara's survival being the miracle of the play's title. Cast * Amy Aston: Kate O'Flynn * Gary Trudgill: Russell Tovey * Val, Amy's grandmother: Sorcha Cusack * Rob, Gary's father: Gerard Horan Critical reception Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer began by saying, \\"I'm in a tricky position here. There is nothing I can say about Molly Davies's remarkable play A Miracle that is going to make you want to see it. Almost throughout its 75 minute running time (it feels much longer) I was desperate to get out of the theatre myself\\", before adding, \\"But this is emphatically a drama that deserves and needs to be seen, not least by those politicians who endlessly bang on about our broken society\\". Spencer recalled that, \\"Babies don't tend to survive for long in Royal Court plays (Remember Edward Bond's Saved?) and poor Cara spends much of the time crying, horribly realistically, in her buggy, shredding the nerves of every parent in the audience\\", but found, \\"It's worth enduring, though, not only for the power and truth of both writing and performances, but also for the tentative glimmer of hope at the end\\". Assessing the cast's performances, he judged that \\"Kate O'Flynn brings an astonishingly raw vulnerability to the stage as Amy […] Sorcha Cusack plays the grandmother with a robust humanity that warms this punishing play; Russell Tovey has a terrifying touch of the psycho about him as the squaddie, while Gerard Horton as his father shows how man hands on misery to man\\". Spencer concluded his review by writing, \\"With a bleakly atmospheric rural design by Patrick Burnier that is so real you can actually smell it and a tense, gutsy production by Lyndsey Turner, this proves a shattering full-length debut by 26-year-old Molly Davies\\". Reviewing the play for The Guardian, Michael Billington gave it 3 stars out of five, saying that \\"while Molly Davies's writing shows real flair in its bony, Bond-like spareness and unnerving hints of violence, her play remains trapped inside the fashionable 70-minute format\\". He found that \\"Davies's strength is her feel for character and place\\" but also that \\"the characters lapse into self pity [….]\\". Billington judged that \\"[…] her dialogue has that wry, laconic quality you often find in East Anglian plays\\" adding that \\"Davies also vividly captures Amy's muddled feelings about motherhood: her resentment of an unwanted child combined with irrepressible familial instinct\\". He concluded his review by noting, \\"Even if this is only the sketch for the richer play Davies will one day write, she is well served by Lyndsey Turner's Theatre Upstairs production. Kate O'Flynn's Amy is a model of gawky despair while Russell Tovey's Gary has an edge of violence that, with memories of Bond's Saved in mind, makes you fear for the baby's survival. Sorcha Cusack as the commonsensical gran and Gerard Horan as an embittered victim of rural blight fill out a play that provides plenty of evidence of youthful talent but that also leaves you wanting more. Perhaps one day Davies might take the plunge and write a two act play\\". In the Evening Standard, Nicholas de Jongh began his 4-star review by saying, \\"It may be set in a Norfolk village last year but Molly Davies's highly promising, first full-length play reminds me irresistibly of Edward Bond's 44-year-old Saved without the violence. In 28 scenes and 80 minutes Miss Davies offers a rural complement to Bond's landscape-vision of down-and-out south Londoners. She shows a flair for creating believable characters, who speak in a terse, unembroidered Norfolk dialect that left me wishing for surtitles\\". He praised both \\"Kate O'Flynn's beautiful rendering of passivity, selfishness and vulnerability\\" and the \\"fine, lumbering incoherence\\" of Russell Tovey's portrayal of Gary. De Jongh also noted the \\"alienated aggression\\" brought to the part of Gary's father by Gerard Horan, adding \\"Sorcha Cusack's believable Gran offers the only ray of cheerfulness\\". He judged that \\"Lyndsey Turner's in-the-round production on a stage needlessly carpeted with turf offers annoyingly impeded views, though scenes flow with seamless ease\\" but concluded his review by saying simply \\"Compelling\\".

The Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) is an image taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory satellite. The location was chosen because, like the Lockman Hole, it is a relatively clear \\"window\\" through the ubiquitous clouds of neutral hydrogen gas in our Milky Way galaxy, which allows us to clearly see the rest of the universe in X-rays. The image is centered on RA DEC (J2000.0), covering 0.11 square degrees, measuring 16 arcminutes across. This patch of sky lies in the Fornax constellation. The image was created by compositing 11 individual ACIS-I exposures for a cumulative exposure time of over one million seconds, in the period 1999-2000, by a team led by Riccardo Giacconi. This region was selected for observation because it has much less galactic gas and dust to obscure distant sources. Further observations taken between 2000 and 2010 have resulted in a total of exposure of over four million seconds. An additional four million seconds of exposure are scheduled to be undertaken by the end of 2015, resulting in an integrated exposure time of eight million seconds. The Chandra Deep Field South is the single target where Chandra has observed the longest. Multispectral observations of the region were carried out in collaboration with the Very Large Telescope and the Paranal Observatory. Through the course of these investigations, the X-ray background was determined to have originated from the central supermassive black holes of distant galaxies, and a better characterization of Type-II Quasars was obtained. Type-2 Quasars, or Quasar2's are quasars that are deeply embedded in dust and gas, from our point of view The CDFS discovered over 300 X-ray sources, many of them from \\"low luminosity\\" AGN lying about 9 billion light years away. The study also discovered the then most distant Quasar 2, lying at redshift z=3.7, some 12 billion light years away. In 2014 and 2015 astronomers detected four very intense burst of X-rays, currently unexplained, from a small galaxy, known as CDF-S XT1, about 11 billion light years from Earth in the Fornax constellation.

Heir presumptive Catherine's birth was long expected, as her parents, Louis I of Hungary and Elizabeth of Bosnia, were childless for the first seventeen years of their marriage. Her birth also secured the succession to the Holy Crown of Hungary, to which Catherine was heir presumptive all her life. Being the eldest daughter of the King of Hungary and Poland who had no sons, Catherine was a much wanted bride. When she was only four years old, she was betrothed to Louis, a younger son of King Charles V of France and future Duke of Orléans. Their marriage was supposed to establish a connection between the two branches of the French royal house. Her father made a set of concessions to the Polish noblemen in exchange for recognizing Catherine (or one of her sisters) as sovereign of Poland after his death. This agreement is known as the Privilege of Koszyce. Thus, Catherine was expected to reign over Hungary and Poland. Her father also planned to leave her his claim to the Crown of Naples and the County of Provence, which were then held by his ailing and childless cousin Joanna I. She was supposed to be married to Louis upon reaching marriageable age, and he would retain the rights to Naples even if the marriage were childless and Catherine were to predecease him, while Provence would become a hereditary fiefdom of the House of Valois. The King of France asked Catherine's father to have Catherine recognised as heir presumptive to the Holy Crown of Hungary; although Provence was important to Charles, establishing a cadet branch of the House of Valois on the Hungarian throne was also significant, as Catherine's prospect of becoming queen of Naples was not realistic.Goodman, 208. Death and aftermath However, Catherine died at the age of seven, predeceasing both her father and her cousin Joanna. The agreement between her father and the noblemen became null and void. Catherine's youngest sister Jadwiga eventually became monarch of Poland. Her other sister Mary, who was betrothed to her fiancé, became heir presumptive and eventually monarch of Hungary.

Subsequent seasons have featured original storylines. This season aired from October 1, 2006 to December 17, 2006, and follows Dexter's investigation of \\"the Ice Truck Killer\\". Introduced in the first episode, \\"Dexter\\", this serial killer targets prostitutes and leaves their bodies severed and bloodless. At the same time, Dexter's foster sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), a vice squad officer, aspires to work in the homicide department, and Dexter's girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), wants their relationship to be more intimate. Christian Camargo appears as Rudy Cooper and is a recurring character until the end of the season. The show's first season received critical acclaim; it was praised as \\"bold, different and exciting, with a central character and performance that take your breath away\\" by the New York Daily News. The Wall Street Journal saw \\"the grotesqueries of Dexter\\" as \\"not something that can easily be dismissed with the old \\"'you don't have to watch' line\\", and concluded that \\"We do have to live among the viewers who will be desensitized, or aroused, by this show\\". The season currently holds an 81% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where the critical consensus reads, \\"Its dark but novel premise may be too grotesque for some, but Dexter is a compelling, elegantly crafted horror-drama.\\" The season received high ratings for Showtime; the pilot episode attracted more than a million viewers, giving the channel its highest ratings in nearly two years, while the finale \\"Born Free\\" drew an audience of 1.1 million viewers in the U.S. On average, the season was watched by two million viewers per episode during its original run when factoring in DVR viewers. Due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild strike and encouraged by the show's critical success and high ratings on Showtime, CBS, a national terrestrial broadcast network, announced in December 2007 that it was considering airing an edited version of the first season of Dexter for free- to-air broadcast. It began to broadcast it on February 17, 2008, and thus, Dexter became the first program in 20 years to air on a broadcast network after being shown on a premium cable channel. During the show's rerun on the CBS network in 2008, the ratings were much higher, reaching 8.2 million viewers during its premiere February, giving the network its best rating in the 10 p.m. timeslot since December the previous year. During its 12-week run, it dropped to 7.1 million in early April, and to 6.6 million during the season's finale on May 6.  Plot  Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department, is secretly a serial killer, arising from a traumatic incident connected to the death of his mother when he was three years old. His adoptive father, Detective Harry Morgan, saw these homicidal tendencies in Dexter as he grew up, and took him on hunting trips to sate his desires to kill. When Dexter admits to having desires to kill people, his adoptive father influences him to follow a \\"code\\": only kill murderers who have escaped prosecution of the law. Since Harry's death, Dexter has killed multiple people, all the while adhering to the code. As his father has taught him, he covers his tracks by taking the victim to a prepared room lined with plastic sheeting in order to easily dispose of the evidence at sea. He only keeps a blood sample of the victim on a glass slide, stored in a box hidden in his apartment. Neither his adoptive sister Debra Morgan nor those in the department know about his secret killings, although Sgt. James Doakes is suspicious of how interested Dexter is in reviewing crime scenes. To help appear normal, Dexter has started dating Rita Bennett, the mother of Astor and Cody, and whose husband Paul is in jail due to drug-related crimes. Because of her abusive previous relationship with Paul, Dexter finds Rita has little interest in sex, keeping their relationship ideal for his purposes. Paul is eventually let out of prison, and tries to get back together with Rita, despite the fact that Rita is planning to divorce him. Seeing Paul get abusive with Rita, Dexter frames Paul for possession of illegal drugs, sending him back to prison. A string of murders of prostitutes leads to the identification of a new serial killer called \\"the Ice Truck Killer\\", due to how the victims' bodies are well-preserved by being kept chilled before they are found. Dexter identifies patterns of the serial killer from his own habits, and lets Debra know, helping the department get a lead on the killer and leading to Debra's promotion to Homicide. Her investigation leads her to meet Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics expert, and they start a relationship. Meanwhile, Dexter discovers that the Ice Truck Killer has broken into his apartment and left taunting clues, leading Dexter to believe that the Killer is playing a game with him. After being notified that he was left a house by his just-deceased biological father, Joe Driscoll, Dexter realizes that his adoptive father was not entirely truthful, and leads him to memories of how his mother died. A gruesome, blood-filled murder scene causes Dexter to recall what had happened: criminals had placed him and his mother, Laura Moser, in a shipping container, killed Laura and dismembered her with a chainsaw. Dexter was locked up in the container in a pool of his mother's blood, to be rescued by Harry two days later. Harry had purposely altered the records to prevent Dexter from finding out. Through Debra, Rudy tries to get closer to Dexter. Dexter comes first to suspect that Joe was murdered, and later affirms that Rudy Cooper is the Ice Truck Killer. With his identity blown, Rudy kidnaps Debra and draws Dexter into a trap to rescue her. Rudy reveals to Dexter that he is his older brother, Brian Moser, also left in the shipping container when Laura was killed. However, unlike Dexter, he was sent off to live in a mental institution. Brian too has developed serial killer tendencies, but did not have the code that Harry instilled in Dexter, and so used the Ice Truck Killer approach to help Dexter recall his past. Brian suggests to Dexter that they kill Debra together, but Dexter refuses. Brian gets away after a fight, and Dexter rescues Debra. As police investigate, Doakes suspects Dexter of knowing more about the Ice Truck Killer than he is letting on. Brian attempts to capture Debra again, but falls into a trap laid by Dexter. Dexter apologizes to Brian before killing him, and leaves Brian's body to make it appear as suicide. The police rule the Ice Truck Killer case closed, though Doakes keeps close tabs on Dexter, still suspicious of his actions. Rita discovers evidence that Dexter may have set up Paul.

The season finale, \\"The British Invasion\\", attracted 1.4 million viewers, making it the program's most-watched episode until the airing of the season three finale, \\"Do You Take Dexter Morgan?\\". Including digital video recorder (DVR) usage, season two was watched by an average of 2.4 million viewers on a weekly basis through 11 full weeks, outperforming season one by 21%. The season received universal acclaim from critics, and was praised as \\"one of the best shows on TV this decade\\" by the Chicago Sun-Times, while Variety considers Hall's portrayal of the title character as a \\"towering achievement, one that eclipses the show's other shortcomings and rough patches\\"; the aggregate site Metacritic scored the season at 85 out of 100 based on 11 reviews. In the season, the bodies of Dexter's victims are uncovered and an investigation is launched in Dexter's own department to find the killer, dubbed the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher\\". During this time, Debra struggles to recover after surviving the Ice Truck Killer's attempts to murder her, and Rita sends Dexter to Narcotics Anonymous meetings when she suspects that he has an addiction. Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King), stalks Dexter, suspecting that he is connected with the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\" killings. Three new characters are introduced: Keith Carradine appears as Special Agent Frank Lundy, an FBI agent who heads the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher\\" investigation, JoBeth Williams as Rita's mother Gail, and Jaime Murray as Lila Tournay, Dexter's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.  Plot  Starting with this season, the show no longer adapts the Dexter novels. Taking place a month after the first-season finale, Dexter has been unable to kill anyone due to Sgt. James Doakes monitoring his activities and his sister Debra now living with him as she recovers from her traumatic experiences concerning Brian, the Ice Truck Killer. Dexter also realizes that he's having trouble killing even when he has the opportunity, due to feelings of guilt over killing his brother Brian. Rita doubts Dexter's reliability and honesty after finding evidence that he set up her husband Paul to be returned to prison. After her husband dies in a prison fight, Rita confronts Dexter with her suspicions. He admits to setting up Paul but after claiming it was a spontaneous act, cannot explain why he happened to be carrying heroin. Rita incorrectly concludes that Dexter is, like Paul, a drug addict and that this explains his occasional absences and odd behavior. Dexter admits that he does indeed have an addiction (without specifying what that addiction is) and promises to seek help by joining Narcotics Anonymous. There, he meets Lila Tournay, who offers to be his sponsor. Sgt. James Doakes remains suspicious of Dexter's true motives, and constantly monitors Dexter's whereabouts. Divers accidentally stumble upon Dexter's underwater burial ground, discovering the many bags containing the body parts of his victims. Realizing this dumping ground is the work of a serial killer, the media dubs these bodies the work of the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher.\\" When it's revealed that each victim was a criminal and killer, some members of the public openly support the Bay Harbor Butcher; the case even inspires the creation of a knife-wielding comic book superhero \\"The Dark Defender.\\" To oversee the investigation of the Butcher's crimes, an FBI special team is assigned to Miami, led by FBI Special Agent Lundy. Working with Miami Metro PD, Lundy brings in several of the Miami detectives, including Debra, to join his team. Over time, Debra and Lundy become romantically involved. To ensure he's not identified as the Bay Harbor Butcher, Dexter finds a new dumping area with current that leads to the Atlantic Ocean. He also falsifies records, destroys evidence, and contaminates refrigerated remains to throw the investigators off his trail. Despite this, Lundy narrows down his suspect search to people in Miami with police training. Dexter puts his guilt over Brian behind him and returns to killing. Dexter later learns that his biological mother died because she was a criminal working as a confidential informant for Harry and had an affair with him. Dexter wonders if he was adopted because Harry felt guilty for his mother's death and he also learns that Harry didn't die of natural causes but purposefully overdosed to cause his own death. He doesn't understand why until later in the season. Doakes becomes confident of Dexter's guilt and confronts him. Dexter then tricks Doakes into assaulting him in the police station, in front of other officers, leading others to side with Dexter that the Sergeant is out of control and causing him to be placed on suspension. Becoming more desperate, Doakes breaks into Dexter's apartment and finds the box of blood samples collected from his victims. However, the investigative team mistakenly concluded that Doakes is the Butcher after finding the box in his car, and Doakes goes into hiding while still tracking Dexter's movements. Lieutenant LaGuerta attempts to vouch for the innocence of her former partner, but Lundy refuses to consider her evidence after he learns that she didn't report previous contact with Doakes during the period he was a fugitive, because of their personal relationship. Meanwhile, Dexter's relationship with Lila becomes closer as she shows him how to accept who he is. When Rita discovers Dexter spent an evening in a hotel with Lila, she breaks up with him and Dexter ends up sleeping with Lila for the first time. Dexter learns that Lila is a pyromaniac, at one point purposely setting fire to her apartment and feigning innocence to draw Dexter back to her. When she starts to follow him obsessively, he takes measures to distance himself from her, eventually forgoing their relationship. Realizing he is developing genuine connection to Rita and her children Astor and Cody, Dexter returns to them. Lila is furious and begins to track Dexter's movements, while also dating Detective Angel Batista. Dexter warns Batista that Lila is not to be trusted but he dismisses the concern. Later, Lila brings rape charges against Batista and tells Dexter she'll drop them if he returns to her. Debra investigates Lila and finds that her real name is Lila West, she is in the country illegally, and she has a criminal history, threatening her with deportation if she doesn't leave Miami. Dexter tracks down the men responsible for his mother's death. One is dead, one is in jail and one, a drug dealer named Jimenez, is alive. Dexter targets Jimenez and tracks down the dealer's secluded cabin in the nearby swamps, where Dexter kills him. Dexter is called away before he can dispose of the body, but feels confident that the cabin is remote. When he finally goes back, he is unaware that Doakes is following him. Dexter subdues Doakes and locks him in a makeshift cell within the cabin, admitting to the sergeant that he is indeed the Bay Harbor Butcher. Dexter decides that he'll escape the law by convincing others that Doakes is the butcher. He kills a drug lord in the cabin in front of Doakes, shocking the police sergeant. Seeing Doakes' reaction to his actions reminds Dexter of something Harry said days before he died. Dexter suddenly realizes that his father committed suicide because he was ashamed of training Dexter to be a serial killer. Horrified, Dexter tells Doakes, \\"I killed my father.\\" While Dexter considers that he must be held responsible for his crimes, Lila takes the GPS device from Dexter's car and uses it to locate the cabin. She finds Doakes, who explains that he is a prisoner of Dexter Morgan, the Bay Harbor Butcher, and needs help. Deciding she now understands Dexter and must help him, Lila leaves Doakes imprisoned and then lights the cabin's gas stove and opens a propane tank. She leaves and Doakes fails to escape, dying in the explosion. Finding Doakes' body and the other evidence Dexter left behind, the FBI concludes that Sgt. Doakes was indeed the Bay Harbor Butcher. Lila admits her actions to Dexter and reaches out to him. Although he is glad not to be going to jail, Dexter did not intend to kill Doakes since he didn't fit the requirements of \\"Harry's Code.\\" However, since Lila is a murderer, he plans to kill her since she is too dangerous to his personal life. He pretends that he wants to run away with Lila, but she realizes the truth and kidnaps Rita's children Astor and Cody. At the same time, Debra is on her way to leaving Miami with Lundy rather than letting their relationship end, but then misses the flight when she learns that the children are in danger and Dexter needs her. Lila lures Dexter to her apartment and then sets it on fire with him and the kids still inside. She leaves, sure that they will all die, but Dexter and the children escape. Debra arrives just as Dexter has gotten to safety and decides to remain in Miami after all. The season concludes with Dexter tracking down Lila to Paris and killing her, avenging Doakes and ensuring that no one alive knows his secret life as a serial killer  Cast   Main cast  * Michael C.

Alec started his career with his local junior side Renton Thistle before moving to Newcastle West End. In the 1888–89 season he moved to Sunderland, then on to Gainsborough Trinity F.C. before joining Burnley during the inaugural season of the English Football League in 1888/89. 1888-1889 Alec Brady made his League and Club debut on 8 September 1888, playing as a winger, at Deepdale, the home of Preston North End. Preston North End won the match 5–2. When Alec Brady played as a winger against Preston North End on 8 September 1888 he was 18 years 211 days old; which made him, on that first weekend of League football, Burnley' youngest player, until 22 September 1888 when Robert Duckworth made his debut. Alec Brady scored his debut League goal on 22 September 1888 at Dudley Road, the then home of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Wolverhampton Wanderers won the match 4–1 and Alec Brady scored Burnley' only goal. Alec Brady appeared in 20 of the 22 League games played by Burnley in season 1888–89 and scored seven League goals.

(registration & fee required) 1889 onwards In August 1889 Brady had been convinced to join Everton by their captain Andrew Hannah, also from Alec's hometown of Renton. However a dispute with his player registration meant he was given a two-month suspension. After scoring twice on his debut against Stoke and a hat-trick in the 11–2 against Derby in the FA Cup, Everton's record victory they narrowly missed out on winning the league trophy to Preston North End. In his second season with Everton they were crowned English League Champions. In the Summer of 1891 he was lured back to Scotland to play for Celtic in the 2nd Scottish Football League Championship. Despite narrowly missing out on the league title to Dumbarton, Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, the club's first ever major trophy. Brady spent just one season at Celtic before moving to The Wednesday for seven seasons. He was a part of the Wednesday side that won the FA Cup in 1896, making Brady one of the first players to win both the Scottish and English trophies at a time when they were considered the pinnacle of football competitions. He returned to Scotland to play with Clydebank in 1899 before returning to his hometown team, Renton where he ended his playing career. After retiring from football he stayed in Renton, where he lived with his family until his death in 1913, aged 43.

Background On 14 March 1957, the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet collapsed as a result of pressure from regional rebellions, splits between the parties comprising it and attacks on the political system, which led to the resignations of members. President Sukarno had expressed his desire for a gotong royong (mutual assistance) cabinet, in which the four major parties, including the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) would work together in the national interest. However, following vociferous opposition from the other parties and the Army, Sukarno was forced to back down. On 15 March, he asked Indonesian National Party chairman Suwirjo to form a cabinet, but he failed, with the result that Sukarno himself called a meeting on 14 April of party leaders and military officers, at which they were all asked if they were prepared to join the cabinet. The Masyumi Party, most of whose members refused to serve in the cabinet, accused Sukarno of acting illegally, but to no avail. The party later expelled its two members who joined the cabinet. Sukarno appointed cabinet veteran Djuanda Kartawidjaja to head a cabinet made up of qualified individuals who did not represent any parties. The cabinet was announced on 8 April and appointed by Sukarno the following day at the Merdeka Palace.Lev (2009) pp 26-34Feith (2007) pp 579-580Simanjuntak (2003) p182 Composition Cabinet Leadership *Prime Minister: Djuanda Kartawidjaja (Indonesian National Party – PNI) *First Deputy Prime Minister: Hardi (Indonesian National Party – PNI) *Second Deputy Prime Minister: Idham Chalid (Nahdlatul Ulama - NU) Cabinet Members *Minister of Foreign Affairs: Subandrio *Minister of Home Affairs: Sanoesi Hardjadinata (Indonesian National Party – PNI) *Minister of Defense : Djuanda *Minister of Justice: G.

The appeal was against a prior case in which the respondent, Harris, argued that the appellants made \\"negligently excessive requirements\\" of their business. The case was presided over by the Vice Chancellor Sir Richard Scott, Lord Justice Auld and Lord Justice Schiemann and involved the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Evans had given advice to local authorities on the safety requirements of a mobile crane and other equipment used by Harris in connection with their bungee jump business which led to the local authorities either banning Harris from offering bungee jump services or serving prohibition notices under the 1974 Act. When the Secretary of State revealed that Evans' advice had not been in keeping with HSE policy, the ban was lifted and the notices withdrawn. The issue was whether Evans, as an HSE officer, in advising local authorities on the safety of equipment used for a bungee jumping business, had a duty of care to Harris to avoid causing economic loss. The court decided that Evans was not liable for Harris' economic loss because he had operated under a statutory duty and his duty of care was to members of the public and not the operators.

History The potential of the Sagami River valley for hydroelectric power development began to be developed in the 1930s, with the growth of population in the Shonan region, and the expansion of industry and electrical consumption in the Yokohama- Kanagawa industrial belt. Plans for a dam on the Sagami River were submitted to the Home Ministry in 1935, but approval was delayed in favor of other projects. Instead, the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly passed the necessary regulations and secured a special budget to begin work in 1938. After actual construction work did not begin immediately, due to the strong opposition of the 196 families who needed to be relocated from the area to be flooded by the dam. However, the wartime demands for power and industrial water by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and by the Keihin Industrial complex became critical, and General Sadao Araki ordered troops into the area to force compliance with the relocation. Work on the Sagami Dam began in 1941 by the Kumagai Gumi construction company; however, the advent of World War II delayed completion until 1947. Design Sagami Hydroelectric Power Station The Sagami Dam a hollow-core concrete gravity dam.

The first fluoro-jade derivative was reported by Larry Schmued in 1997 as an alternative method from traditional methods for labeling degenerating neurons such as silver nitrate staining, H&E; stain, or Nissl stain. Fluoro-Jade may be preferred to other degenerative stains due to simplicity of staining procedures and visual interpretation, which are common drawbacks of conventional degenerative stains. However, the mechanism by which fluoro-jade labels degenerating neurons is unknown thus creating some controversy to the actual physiological condition of the labeled cells.  Chemical properties  Currently, there are three fluoro-jade dyes (Fluoro-Jade, Fluoro-Jade B, and Fluoro-Jade C ), all of which are anionic derivatives of fluorescein and highly acidic. Specifically, Fluoro-Jade is a mixture of 5-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxyfluorescein disodium salts, whereas Fluoro-Jade B is a mixture of (1) trisodium 5-(6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9yl)benzene, 1,2,4 tricarboxylic acid, (2) disodium 2-(6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9yl)-5-(2,4-dihydroxybenzol)terepthalic acid, and (3) disodium 2,5-bis(6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9yl)terepthalic acid. All three fluoro-jade species have similar excitation and emission profiles as fluorescein (excitation: 495 nm; emission:521 nm) and thus can be visualized using a fluorescein/FITC filter. The newer dyes, fluoro-jade B and fluoro-jade C, were developed to improve signal to noise ratio, therefore creating superior compounds for visualizing finer neuronal morphology including dendrites, axons and nerve terminals.  General staining techniques  Nearly all processed tissue is compatible with fluoro-jade stain including tissue from rodents (mice and rats), non-human primates and humans. Mounted tissue is stepwise rehydrated with decreasing concentrations of alcohol. Potassium permanganate may be used to decrease background staining and protect tissue from fading and photo bleaching. Fluoro-Jade is highly soluble in water and is therefore first dissolved in distilled water. In order to be specific for degenerating neurons, fluoro-jade must be used in an acidic environment, therefore fluoro-jade is further diluted in glacial acetic acid. Additional water washes should be used to rinse tissue before drying and coverslipping. Fluoro-Jade staining procedures are flexible and therefore can be adapted to be compatible with other staining techniques such as immunohistochemistry. Several modifications to the general procedures can be made such as reducing potassium permanganate incubations to avoid disrupting immunofluorescent labeling. Background can be decreased by alternative methods such as lowering staining temperature or decreasing Fluoro-Jade concentration, which may be more compatible with other labeling techniques. Such alterations, however should be determined empirically to optimize specific experimental conditions . In addition to staining tissue from treated subjects, positive and negative controls should be included to ensure method specificity and validity. Typically tissue from untreated control subjects is included to show specificity for degenerating neurons as fluoro-jade should not stain non- degenerating tissue. Additionally, a positive control is included to ensure validity of staining procedures; to show that degenerating neurons will be stained with fluoro-jade. An acceptable positive control includes neurodegenerative tissue from subjects where fluoro-jade has already been validated, such as kainic acid treated animals.  Analysis  Fluoro-Jade stained tissue can be visualized under an epifluorescent microscope using a filter system designed for fluorescein or fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) (excitation: 495 nm; emission:521 nm). Multiple morphological features can be detected using fluoro-jade stain including cell bodies, dendrites, axons, and axon terminals. Even though all fluoro-jade derivatives can detect these specific morphological features, the newer derivatives (FlJb and FlJc) have greater specificity and resolution and therefore are superior in detecting finer morphological features. Fluorojade is typically quantified in every 6th-12th 40 nm section within the region of interest and expressed as cells/section. Alternatively, stereological procedures may be used to estimate total fluorojade positive cells within the defined region.  Technique validation  As the mechanism of fluoro-jade labeling is unknown, correlative analysis with traditional neuronal degeneration stains was used to validate this technique. Initially fluoro-jade staining was compared with H & E and de Olmos’ cupric-staining methodologies in a variety of neurotoxic models of neurodegeneration such as injection of kainic acid, MPTP, or multivalent metals. Each of these neurotoxic insults produce brain-region specific neuronal degeneration and thus could be used to the determine specificity of fluoro-jade. Indeed, these studies demonstrated that fluoro-jade consistently reproduced insult specific staining patterns of neuronal degeneration that were identical to H&E; and de Olmos’ cupric staining patterns after the same neurotoxic insults. These results suggest that fluoro-jade is a reliable marker of neurodegeneration. Larry Schmued suggests that a basic \\"death molecule\\" is expressed by damaged cells and that the highly anionic and acidic fluoro-jade may be specific for this target. Further supporting the validity of fluoro-jade stain and this hypothesis is the work of Auer et al., who demonstrated that another anionic dye, fuchsine acid, could successfully bind to damaged neurons after a hyperglycemic insult presumably by the same electrostatic mechanism as fluoro-jade. These neurons were characterized by cell death morphology including condensed chromatin, a disrupted plasma membrane, and a disrupted nuclear membrane. Although fluoro-jade and de Olmos’ silver stain have the same pattern of staining in models of neurotoxicity, there are inherent differences between the two methodologies that may have physiological implications. For example, a time course analysis of neuronal degeneration between the two techniques shows that silver stain is evident earlier after a neurotoxic insult which may suggest that fluoro-jade is specific for a later, more committed stage of the degenerative process.  Applications Traumatic brain injury Spinal cord injury Alzheimer's disease Aging Stroke Epilepsy Alcoholism Drug abuse  Other  Fluoro-jade may also be useful for other applications other than labeling degeneration neurons of the brain. Several reports have demonstrated that fluorojade is also useful in detecting glia, specifically reactive astroglia and microglia . Thus fluorojade may be used to assess glial responses associated with neurotoxicity. Additionally, other studies demonstrate that fluoro-jade can also label neurons outside the CNS such as neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. Finally, fluoro-jade may find use in non-neuronal systems as investigators have reported its use to assess cell death in renal tubular epithelial cells, in vitro and in vivo.

The \\"four policy pillars\\" of the organization are expanding health insurance to all Americans; ensuring high-quality 21st- century care; expanding access to care; and improving practice environments for physicians in order to help them focus on improving patient care. The organization partnered with the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Medical Student Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association, and other organizations to promote health reform legislation in Congress to issue an July 30, 2009 open letter to all members of Congress publicly announcing their support for health reform legislation. Some commentators stated that this large coalition of doctors (the organizations collectively represented nearly 450,000) provided an important counterweight to the American Medical Association's organization's initial opposition to health reform in 2009; later AMA statements supported health reform in principle. Doctors for America also organized a website, Voices of Physicians (www.voicesofphysicians.org), which allowed physicians to publicize their frustrations with the current health system and their recommendations for improvement, and organized house meetings of physicians across the country to talk about health reform, and interactive web talks with figures such as Jacob Hacker and Howard Dean, and participated in White House meetings on health reform.

Originally, if a user opened an RDP (remote desktop) session to a server it would load the login screen from the server for the user. This would use up resources on the server, and was a potential area for denial of service attacks as well as remote code execution attacks (see BlueKeep). Network Level Authentication delegates the user's credentials from the client through a client-side Security Support Provider and prompts the user to authenticate before establishing a session on the server. Network Level Authentication was introduced in RDP 6.0 and supported initially in Windows Vista. It uses the new Security Support Provider, CredSSP, which is available through SSPI in Windows Vista. With Windows XP Service Pack 3, CredSSP was introduced on that platform and the included RDP 6.1 Client supports NLA; however CredSSP must be enabled in the registry first.  Advantages  The advantages of Network Level Authentication are: * It requires fewer remote computer resources initially, by preventing the initiation of a full remote desktop connection until the user is authenticated, reducing the risk of denial-of-service attacks. * It allows NT Single sign-on (SSO) to extend to Remote Desktop Services. * It can help mitigate Remote Desktop vulnerabilities than can only be exploited prior to authentication.  Disadvantages  * No support for other credential providers * To use Network Level Authentication in Remote Desktop Services, the client must be running Windows XP SP3 or later, and the host must be running Windows Vista or later or Windows Server 2008 or later. * Support for RDP Servers requiring Network Level Authentication needs to be configured via registry keys for use on Windows XP SP3. * Not possible to change password via CredSSP. This is a problem when \\"User must change password at next logon\\" is enabled or if an account's password expires. * Requires \\"Access this computer from the network\\" privilege, which may be restricted for other reasons. * The IP addresses of the clients trying to log in will not be stored in the security audit logs, making it harder to block brute force or dictionary attacks by means of a firewall. * Smart card authentication from one domain to another using a remote desktop gateway is not supported with NLA enabled on the end client.

Professional and political career  As well as being a member of the Turkish Human Rights Association (İHD), she is a founding member of the Patriotic Women's Association (YKD). She was a candidate of the Thousand Hopes alliance in the elections to the Turkish Parliament in 2007, and was elected MP for Diyarbakir. She previously acted as a lawyer for Abdullah Öcalan.http://mq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/19/2/99 Aysel Tuğluk's status as an elected Member of Parliament gave her legal immunity from going to prison due to a sentence of 1 year and 6 months imprisonment. But in December 2009 the Turkish Constitutional Court stripped her of her Member of Parliament status, and banned her from public politics for five years. The Constitutional Court also outlawed the DTP political party. The Constitutional Court's decision was based on a judgment that she and the DTP have affiliations with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organization that does not disavow violence for attaining political objectives. She and the DTP continue to deny such affiliations, and they disavow violence. She was re- elected as an Member of Parliament in the 12 June 2011 general election having run as an independent. Legal prosecution  Sentences of 2007 and 2009  In 2007 she was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment over the distribution of party leaflets in the Kurdish language, which is forbidden according to the law, which requires all political literature be in Turkish. On 5 February 2009 Tuğluk was sentenced again, this time to 18 months in prison by a court in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir for violating anti-terrorism laws by referring to PKK fighters as 'heroes to some' at a rally in 2006.  Sentence of 2012  In June 2012 Aysel Tuğluk was sentenced to 14 years and 7 months imprisonment for charges of \\"committing a crime on behalf of the armed terrorist organization PKK without being a member\\" and also for \\"making propaganda on behalf of a terrorist organization\\" for ten speeches she held. Her lawyers defended her, arguing that she held the speeches in the aim of fomenting fraternity and unity. The authorities just picked a few phrases they did not agree with. The defendants lawyers said they appealed the sentence at the Supreme Court of Appeals.  Sentences of 2018  On the 26 December 2016 she was arrested and in January 2018 sentenced to 1 year and 6 months in prison for “Opposing the law on rallies and demonstrations\\". In March 2018 she was sentenced to another 10 years in prison for being a \\"leader of a terror organization\\". It was argued that she took orders from Abdullah Öcalan, made statements to media outlets close to the PKK and attended funerals of terrorists. She denied being a member of a terrorist organization and that she was only member of the Democratic Society Congress (DTK) and the HDP, which are not terror organizations.

At the foot of the page is the legend \\"Printed by W. Stansby for John Barnes, dwelling near Holborne Conduit. 1613.\\" The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster is the account of a series of English witch trials that took place on 18–19 August 1612, commonly known as the Lancashire witch trials. Except for one trial held in York they took place at Lancaster Assizes. Of the twenty men and women accused – amongst them the Pendle witches and the Samlesbury witches – eleven were found guilty and subsequently hanged; one was sentenced to stand in the pillory, and the rest were acquitted. Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes, was ordered by the trial judges Sir James Altham and Sir Edward Bromley to write an account of the proceedings, making them some of the most famous and best recorded witch trials of the 17th century. Potts completed the work on 16 November 1612, and submitted it to the judges for review. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, declaring it to be \\"truly reported\\" and \\"fit and worthie to be published\\". Historian Stephen Pumfrey has suggested that Bromley and Altham worked closely with Potts in the writing of The Wonderfull Discoverie \\"to manipulate the extraordinary records into an account that would protect and advance their careers\\". Potts' book has been called the \\"clearest example of an account [of a witch trial] obviously published to display the shining efficiency and justice of the legal system\\". Although written as an apparently verbatim account, Potts was not reporting what had actually been said during the trials; he was reflecting what had happened. Thomas Potts The author of The Wonderfull Discoverie, Thomas Potts, was brought up in the home of Thomas Knyvet, the man who in 1605 was credited with apprehending Guy Fawkes in his attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament and thus saving the life of King James I. At the time of writing his book, Potts was lodging in Chancery Lane, in London. Potts was employed as a clerk of the peace for the East Riding of Yorkshire in about 1610–11, and was an associate clerk on the northern assize circuit in the summer of 1612, when the Lancashire witch trials took place. Although he had sufficient legal training to be able to advise Justices of the Peace, he had not received a university education. The normal career progression for a man in his position would have been a slow promotion to Clerk of the Assize, but only a few years after the publication of his book Potts began to receive \\"considerable royal favour\\", suggesting that his account of the trials met with the King's approval. King James was keenly interested in the breeding of hounds, and in 1615 Potts was rewarded with \\"the keepership of Skalme Park ... for the breeding and training of hounds\\". Three years later he was granted \\"the office of collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years\\", a position that gave him the authority to appoint deputies. 17th- century jurisprudence Potts has been described as an \\"active and selective reporter\\"; he omits significant details of court procedure in the early 17th- century English legal process, such as that all indictments were initially submitted to a grand jury, whose task was to decide whether there was a prima facie case against the accused before the prisoners were taken into the courtroom to be tried by the petty jury, the forerunner of the modern jury. The accused witches would not have been tried separately as Potts' account suggests, but in groups. Potts also represents written depositions as if they had been spoken in court, and he almost certainly \\"improved\\" Bromley's speeches. Researcher Marion Gibson has suggested that \\"Potts and other pamphleteers have a different understanding of truthful reporting from modern scholars, subjugating what really happened to what ought to have happened.\\" Nevertheless, Potts \\"seems to give a generally trustworthy, though not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports\\". Political background Thomas Knyvet arresting Guy Fawkes in the cellar of the Houses of Parliament The trials took place not quite seven years after the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in an attempt to kill King James and the Protestant aristocracy had been foiled. It was alleged that the Pendle witches had hatched their own gunpowder plot to blow up Lancaster Castle, although historian Stephen Pumfrey has suggested that the \\"preposterous scheme\\" was invented by the examining magistrates. It may therefore be significant that Potts dedicated The Wonderfull Discoverie to Thomas Knyvet and his wife Elizabeth; Knyvet was the man credited with apprehending Guy Fawkes and thus saving the king's life.

For example, in the legal profession, where this system is most commonly found, all law school graduates hired by a law firm who graduated in the same year receive the same base pay regardless of background, experience, or ability. These associates will also receive automatic annual pay raises, bonuses, and promotions. Alternatively, some law firms implement a lockstep compensation system starting with partners or partner-track associates. During the late-2000s financial crisis, some law firms began replacing the lockstep system with \\"merit-based\\" systems. Proponents of the system have argued that lockstep compensation promotes loyalty, discourages intra-office competition, reduces the need for perpetual performance assessment, and provides for more flexible work structures. These benefits, however, are limited to situations where a business can predict with some certainty the future productivity of an employee. At the same time, however, the system has been criticized for being inefficient and reducing incentives for employees to improve performance. Because a lockstep system provides little to no accountability for employee productivity, there can be little assurance that employees will not take advantage by reducing their output or that extremely energetic employees will be under-compensated. Some law firms have modified their lockstep system to allow for performance-based bonus structures. These bonuses can partially cure the incentive-based issues that stem from lockstep compensation. Other law firms have moved toward adopting a purely merit-based compensation system for associates. Purely merit-based models have been criticized as too volatile, with the prominent failed example of Dewey & LeBoeuf failing under a merit- based partnership system.

Though minimum Energy Efficiency Standards were first established by the United States Congress in Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), those standards were then amended by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. All of these laws and regulations have to do with creating mandatory standards that deal with the energy efficiency of certain household appliances. These standards were put in place to ensure that manufacturers were building products that are at the maximum energy efficiency levels are that are technically feasible and economically justified. History The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1975 (NAECA) was enacted to help create uniform appliance efficiency standards at a time when individual states were creating their own standards. The NAECA established a conservation program for major household appliances, however no real standards came into existence until the 1980s when appliance manufacturers realized it was easier to conform to a uniform federal standard then individual state standards. The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 amended the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and was introduced and supported by democratic Senator Bennett Johnston, Jr. from Louisiana in January 1987. The new amendments to the act established minimum efficiency standards for many household appliances, including: *Refrigerators *Refrigerator-Freezers *Freezers *Room Air Conditioner *Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts *Incandescent Reflector Lamps *Clothes Dryers *Clothes Washers *Dishwashers *Kitchen Ranges and Ovens *Pool Heaters *Television Sets (withdrawn in 1995) *Water Heaters Congress set the initial efficiency standards at the start of the act then set a schedule for the United States Department of Energy to review them. The act also put into place laws prohibiting manufacturers from making any representations about the energy efficiency of any product on this list without first being tested by Federal testing procedure, and disclosing the results of such tests. Lastly the new act set new rules for when state regulations will be superseded by federal regulations in regard to testing and labeling requirements, and energy conservation standards.

Bernardi earned a Bachelor of Arts in Radio-TV (1984) and a Masters of Arts in Media Arts (1988) from the University of Arizona. He went on to earn a PhD in Film and Television Studies from UCLA (1994). He completed a University of California postdoctoral research fellowship in 1997. His main academic interests are media studies, narrative theory, critical race theory, and rumors as narrative IEDS. His work in media, which is perhaps most well known, emphasizes whiteness as a historical formation of meanings. Borrowing from Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation, he argues that whiteness is a historically powerful set of meanings that serves to either implicitly or explicitly dominate the shifting and reforming meaning of race in U.S. media. Bernardi is also a documentary filmmakerEl Dorado Films. His current body of work focuses on telling the veteran story. One of his more recent films, The American War (2018), tells the story of the Vietnam War from the perspective of the Vietcong. Another used discovered archival footage to tell the story of first World War, and is titled The War to End all Wars. Both films are distributed by Journeyman Pictures. Career Bernardi has taught film, television and new media at UC Riverside (1997–1998), UCLA (1999-2000), Arizona State University (1999-2011), and SFSU (2011–Present). He was awarded a Ford Foundation Dissertation Fellowship (1994), a UC President's Post- Doctoral Fellowship (1995–1997), and a Fulbright Fellowship (2009). His deployment to Iraq prevented his acceptance of the Fulbright Fellowship. From 1998 to 2000, he worked for the Sci-Fi Channel as a consultant, writer and producer/host of the web feature Future Now (since deleted). Daniel Bernardi has earned a reputation of notoriety among the more avid Star Trek fans due to his writings about the role of race in the films.Los Angeles Times, Trekking Through College Bernardi is also an officer in the United States Navy Reserves. He has served at sea on the , the , the , and the , as well as at shore in Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and at the Pentagon with the Chief of Navy Information. From May 2009 to February 2010 he was recalled to Active Duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for ten months. In Iraq, Bernardi served with US Special Forces as the Public Affairs Officer for Special Operations Task Force-Central, where he trained Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) and Emergency Response Brigade (ERB) Soldiers on combat camera and media operations. He also managed US media embeds, including CNN, NBC and AP, and US Army and US Navy journalists and photographers. In 2011 he returned to Active Duty for nine months and served as the Mission Public Affairs Officer for Pacific Partnership 2011, an annual humanitarian assistance initiative sponsored by the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Bernardi managed a team of military (U.S., Australian and New Zealand) and NGO (Project Hope) photographers, videographers and writers assigned to document and report on the mission. Following his tour in Iraq and the South Pacific, Bernardi, working with a larger research team including H. L. (Bud) Goodall Jr., received a $1.6 million renewable grant from the Office of Naval Research to catalogue and study the impact rumors have on counterinsurgency operations. As an example, when multinational forces began a cattle vaccination program in 2005, a rumor spread among the Iraqis that U.S. forcers were poisoning their livestock. Though they had intended on using modern medicine to protect their food supplies, the rumor completely disarmed their efforts. In order to combat such debilitating narratives, Bernardi and his team worked to create a comprehensive database of known Islamist narratives and reveal how these narratives are used to influence populations in the Middle East and North Africa. The hope is that expeditionary forces would have access to these narratives and, through the team's analysis' on hand, work against them. In 2012, Bernardi launched the Veteran Documentary Corps College of liberal and Creative Arts (VDC) project. Founded by donations and grants, the VA and National Cemetery Administration including, VDC produces and exhibits short documentaries on the struggles and successes of veterans from across the world.

Bibliography As author * Off the Page: Screenwriting in the Era of Media Convergence (co-author). 2017. University of California Press. Examines the business and craft of screenwriting in the era of media convergence. Daniel Bernardi and Julian Hoxter use the recent history of screenwriting labor coupled with close analysis of scripts in the context of the screenwriting paraindustry—from “how to write a winning script” books to screenwriting software—to explore the state of screenwriting today. They address the conglomerate studios making tentpole movies, expanded television, Indiewood, independent animation, microbudget scripting, the video games industry, and online content creation. Designed for students, producers, and writers who want to understand what studios want and why they want it, this book also examines how scripting is developing in the convergent media, beneath and beyond the Hollywood tentpole. By addressing specific genres across a wide range of media, this essential volume sets the standard for anyone in the expanded screenwriting industry and the scholars that study it.University of California Press Blog * Landmines: Rumors, Islamist Extremism, and the Struggle for Strategic Influence Rumors (co-authored). 2012. Rutgers University Press. Bernardi and his co-authors characterize rumors as bits and pieces of prevailing narrative systems and local cultural artifacts, and that their anonymous origin and dubious truth claims afford them a type of concealment until their effects are known and the damage is done. Focusing on the impact of rumors on counterinsurgency operations (Iraq), counter terrorism whisper campaigns (Indonesia), and civil disobedience online (Singapore), they argue that rumors are narrative IEDs, or Improvised Explosive Device, in that they’re constructed of locally available materials and hidden in the landscape until detonation. Bernardi and his co- authors see rumors as similarly ad hoc, constructed of bits and pieces of narrative systems, and lying unseen to the military information operator, diplomat, civic outreach coordinator, or business strategist until exploding and disrupting expensive and highly wrought communication campaignsRutgers University Press. *Star Trek and History: Race-ing Toward a White Future\\". 1998.

Bernardi traces the shifting and reforming meaning of race articulated throughout the Star Trek television series, feature films, and fan community, investigating and, in his word, \\"politicizing\\" the presentation of race in Star Trek in the original series of the 1960s, the feature films and television spin-offs of the 1980s and 1990s, and the current fan community on the Internet. Through both critical and historical analysis, he proposes a method of studying the framing of race in popular film and television that integrates sociology, critical theory and cultural studies. Bernardi goes on to examine the representational and narrative functions of race in Star Trek and explores how the meaning of \\"race\\" in the science fiction series has been facilitated or constrained by creative and network decision-making, by genre, by intertextuality, and by fans. He interprets how the changing social and political movements of the times have influenced the production and meaning of \\"Trek\\" texts and the ways in which the ongoing series negotiated and reflected these turbulent histories. Unpopular with many Trekkers, Star Trek and History went into a second printing after a year of its original publication. Other readers feel Bernardi apologies for Star Trek's racial vision.Rutgers University Press As editor * Race in American Film: Voices and Visions That Shaped a Nation, Volumes I, II and III.

In these books, Bernardi relies on a range of scholars to show how race in general and whiteness in particular formed unique representational, narrational, and institutional patterns across U.S. film history. The introductions to each book set out a broad theory of whiteness in American film that, in brief, positions whiteness as a performance about who passes and who doesn't pass as white — and what it means in specific films and periods of film history to either pass or not pass as white. The last book in the series, Filming Difference, includes essays and interviews by filmmakers who address critically and creatively how they go about representing race, gender and sexuality in their work. .

Life From a family at Barkham, Sussex, his father, James Comber, was the fourth son of John Comber, who was uncle to Thomas Comber, Dean of Carlisle. His mother was Mary, daughter of Bryan Burton of Westerham, Kent, and widow of Edward Hampden. Thomas was born at Westerham on 19 March 1645; his father was driven by the war to take refuge in Flanders for four years, during which time his son was left entirely under the care of his mother. His father returned to Westerham in 1649, and in the following year Comber was placed under the tuition of the Rev. Thomas Walter. He could read and write Greek before he was ten years old. On 18 April 1659, after some changes of school, he was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, under Edmund Matthews, B.D., senior fellow and president of the college. He studied experimental philosophy, geometry, astronomy, music, painting, and the oriental tongues, besides learning a common-place method for philosophy and divinity. His family was poor, but he procured an annual exhibition and received support from a relative of Dr. Richard Minshall, Master of the college. On 18 January 1663 he was chosen scholar of the house, and three days later he was admitted to the degree of B.A. Early in 1663 he was invited to the house of one of his preceptors, Mr. Holland, now rector of All Hallows Staining, London; and having been ordained deacon on 18 August by dispensation, he read prayers on Sundays for Mr. Holland, and studied on weekdays in the library of Sion College. Soon afterwards he became curate to the Rev. Gilbert Bennet, rector of Stonegrave, Yorkshire. He was ordained priest in York Minster by Archbishop Richard Sterne on 20 September 1664, In May 1666 he performed the exercise for his degree of M.A.; the commencement was postponed in consequence of the Great Plague of London breaking out, and he was admitted to the degree by proxy. He was appointed chaplain to John Frescheville, 1st Baron Frescheville. While he was curate of Stonegrave he was invited to reside with William Thornton of East Newton, Yorkshire, and he afterwards married his daughter Alice. Here he wrote theological pieces and poetry. In 1669 Comber was inducted to the rectory of Stonegrave on Bennet's resignation. In 1672 appeared the first instalment of his major work, the Companion to the Temple, intended to reconcile Protestant dissenters to the church of England. On 5 July 1677 he was installed prebendary of Holme in the church of York, and on 10 January 1678 he was presented, by Sir Hugh Cholmeley, 4th Baronet, to the living of Thornton-le-Clay, ten miles from Stonegrave. He obtained a dispensation to hold both livings from the Archbishop of Canterbury, who created him D.D. by patent on 28 June 1678. He obtained the prebend of Fenton in the church of York in 1681, and in the following year he was nominated one of the chaplains to the Princess Anne. In 1683 he resigned the prebend of Fenton, and on 19 October in that year he was instituted precentor of York and prebendary of Driffield. Soon afterwards he went into residence at York, and was put into the commission of the peace. He was also chosen one of the proctors of the chapter of York in the convocation of the northern province. In the reign of James II he refused to attend the chapter held on 25 August 1688 for the suspension of the Rev. Mr. Lawson, in compliance with an order of the Court of High Commission. When the king sent a silver crozier to York, and a congé d'élire with a recommendation of Dr. Smith, a Roman Catholic, the precentor determined to accept the invitation formerly given him by the Princess of Orange to take refuge with her. When William III and Mary II were proclaimed at York, he preached in the cathedral to a large audience. King William restored him to the office of justice of the peace after a year's suspension, and on 19 July 1689 he took the necessary oaths. His old friend John Tillotson procured for him the deanery of Durham, in succession to Dr. Dennis Grenville, a nonjuror. He was installed on 9 May 1691. He died on 25 November 1699 at East Newton, and was buried in Stonegrave church. Works His works, in addition to some occasional sermons, are: * A Companion to the Temple and Closet; or a help to publick and private devotion, in an Essay upon the daily Offices of the Church, 2 parts, London, 1672-6; 2nd edition, with additions, 2 parts, London, 1676-9; 4 parts, London, 1684 and 1688; 4th edition, 1701-2. 1 Morning and Evening Prayer Part 2 The Litany with the Occasional Prayers and Thanksgivings A new edition was published at the Clarendon Press (7 vols., Oxford, 1841,) without addition, and omitting the preface to Comber's later editions.

Comber supported the Glorious Revolution, and published two pamphlets in defence of the government: A modest Vindication of the Protestants of England who joined with the Prince of Orange; and An Apology for the Oath of Allegiance. When the French invasion was projected in 1692, he published a pamphlet called The Pretences of the French Invasion examined for the information of the People of England; and in the preface to a new edition of William King's State of the Protestants of Ireland he undertook to show that James II carried on the design of destroying liberty, property, and Protestantism. His great-grandson, the Rev. Thomas Comber, published Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Comber, D.D. London, 1799, (with portrait). Family Comber married in 1668 Alice, eldest daughter of William Thornton of East Newton, by Alice Wandesford Thornton his wife, younger daughter of Sir Christopher Wandesford of Kirklington, Lord Deputy of Ireland. With this lady, who died on 20 January 1720, aged 87, he had four sons and two daughters.

It began as a label for low-priced 78 rpm records in the 1920s and 1930s. It was revived for budget albums of reissued tracks in 1957.http://www.bsnpubs.com/columbia/harmony/harmony7000.html The revived label was most active during the 1960s, and Columbia continued to issue repackages on the label into the mid-1970s. Harmony's records were acoustically recorded until 1929, although electrical recording dominated the industry. It has been stated that Columbia redesigned its acoustic recording process before electrical recording took over, and so the Harmony sound was better than most acoustic recordings. In 1931 into 1932, Columbia instituted a couple of short-lived series: a handful of double tracked records and also another series of longer playing records. Grigsby-Grunow, the company that bought Columbia, discontinued Harmony, Velvet Tone Records, and Clarion Records. In 1957 Columbia revived the Harmony label for its budget album line. These albums consisted of older material recorded by current or former Columbia recording artists. The albums sold for $1.99-2.99. By the late 1960s these bargain-priced discs to be so popular Columbia actually acquired the rights to some recordings from ABC, Warner Bros., and Reprise to keep up with the demand for more releases. The final new compilations on Harmony were issued in 1974 but a number of titles remained in print until 1979. Virtually every major recording artist who was ever under Columbia had at some point had at least one Harmony compilation. Among the most popular artists for Harmony compilations were Doris Day, Frank Sinatra, The Carter Family, Roy Acuff, Tony Bennett, The Everly Brothers, Dinah Shore, Aretha Franklin, Judy Garland, Johnny Cash, Lynn Anderson, and Billie Holiday.

The story follows Harry Brown, a widowed Royal Marines veteran who had served in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, living on a London housing estate that is rapidly descending into youth crime. After a violent gang murders his friend, Harry decides to take justice into his own hands. The film also features actor and rapper Plan B who, with Chase & Status, is also responsible for the film's theme music track \\"End Credits.\\" Harry Brown had its World Premiere on 12 September 2009 as a \\"Special Presentation\\" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom by Lionsgate UK on 11 November 2009; the film was released in the United States by Samuel Goldwyn Films and Destination Films on 30 April 2010. The film was mainly shot on and around the mostly abandoned Heygate Estate in Walworth, London,\\"South London's Heygate estate mourned by locals – and Hollywood\\", The Guardian, 3 September 2010 which was, at the time of filming, due to be demolished in late 2010 (demolition was eventually delayed and did not take place until early 2014). The subway scenes were shot at Marks Gate, London. Plot Harry Brown is an elderly pensioner who is a decorated Royal Marine, and a veteran of Northern Ireland. He lives on a London council estate ruled by violent gangs and spends most of his time playing chess with his friend, Len Attwell, at a local pub owned by Sid Rourke. When the hospital phones to tell him that his wife, Kath, is dying, Harry is too late to see her because he is scared to take a shortcut through a pedestrian underpass, where a gang holds court. His wife is laid to rest next to the grave of their thirteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died in 1973. Len confides to Harry that he is being terrorised by youths and shows him an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself; with the police unable to help, he plans to confront his harassers himself. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock, who tell him that Len has been murdered. The police arrest Noel Winters, the leader of a drug-dealing gang, along with members Carl, Dean and Marky, but they are released due to lack of evidence. Harry gets drunk after Len's funeral, and is then held at knife-point by Dean, who intends to rob him; Harry kills Dean with his own knife during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry in the morning to inform him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self- defence, which infuriates Harry. Harry follows a drug dealer, Kenny, to a den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch, growing cannabis and sexually abusing an overdosing girl to make pornographic films. Harry kills the dealers before burning down their den, fleeing with the girl and a bag of firearms. He leaves the girl outside a hospital, and then follows Marky, killing a drug dealer who is sexually abusing him. He then tortures Marky into revealing some mobile phone camera footage of Len's murder, proving the gang did not kill Len in self-defence. Harry uses Marky to bait Noel and Carl into a gunfight in the underpass; Carl and Marky are killed, and Noel flees with Harry in pursuit, only for Harry to collapse from an emphysema attack. Harry is found and taken to hospital. Frampton has deduced that Harry is behind all the recent shootings, but her boss—Superintendent Childs—is instead convinced that they are all part of an escalating gang war. Childs orders a major police operation on the estate, which results in a riot. Harry discharges himself from the hospital to pursue Noel. Driving onto the estate to stop him, Frampton and Hicock are involved in a car crash in which Hicock is severely injured. Harry rescues them and takes them to Sid's pub, where Frampton warns Harry that Sid is actually Noel's uncle. Harry discovers that Sid has been hiding Noel, but his guard drops due to his emphysema, allowing Sid to disarm him and reveal himself to be the gang's real leader. Frampton tries to call for backup but is stopped by Noel, who begins to strangle her after Sid suffocates Hicock to death. Though weakened, Harry draws a concealed revolver and kills Noel; Sid prepares to kill Harry in retaliation only to be shot dead by police snipers, who have responded to Frampton's call. At a press conference after the riot, Superintendent Childs announces that Frampton and Hicock are to be given awards (the latter posthumously), but stresses there is no evidence a vigilante was involved in the case. The film ends with Harry—seemingly recovered—walking towards the underpass, which is now quiet and gang-free.

The resulting beam of sound travels farther, with less dissipation in air, than horn loudspeakers, and can be sent to isolated audience targets, unlike line array loudspeakers.Borgerson, Bruce. \\"Technology Showcase: Focused Loudspeaker Systems.\\" AVInstall, November 1, 2005. Retrieved on August 25, 2009. The parabolic loudspeaker has been used for such diverse purposes as directing sound at faraway targets in performing arts centers and stadia, for industrial testing, for intimate listening at museum exhibits, and as a sonic weapon. Technology A parabolic loudspeaker can send sound farther than traditional loudspeaker designs. The focused waves of a parabolic loudspeaker tend to dissipate in air at about 3 dB SPL per doubling of distance, rather than the usual 6 dB of conventional loudspeakers. Parabolic reflector In a parabolic reflecting loudspeaker, one or more speaker drivers are mounted at the focal point of a parabola, pointing away from the audience, toward the parabolic surface. The sound is bounced off the parabolic dish and leaves the dish focused in plane waves. The lowest frequency that can be directed into a narrow beam is dependent on the size of the parabolic dish. A parabolic reflector type of loudspeaker must have a diameter twice that of the wavelength of the lowest desired frequency, so to obtain directional control of frequencies down to 20 Hz, the dish would have to be over wide.[math error present] (citation needed) Limitations of parabolic reflector loudspeakers include the fact that they are comparatively large and bulky, and that they have a fixed beam width with no ability to broaden or narrow the coverage pattern without changing the curvature of the dish. Their beam width is wider for low frequencies than it is for high frequencies, so at the periphery of the coverage pattern there is a region of sound coverage that doesn't receive the full strength of the high frequencies.Meyer, John; Meyer, Perrin; Schwenke, Roger; Rubio, Alejandro Antonio Garcia. Loudspeaker system and method for producing a controlled synthesized sound field. June 26, 2008. Retrieved on August 25, 2009. In addition, some frequencies are reflected more efficiently than others, so the frequency response is uneven unless audio signal processing correction is applied before the signal reaches the amplifier. The presence and placement of the speaker driver prevents the center of the parabolic dish from reflecting sound outward, as that sound would reflect back into the speaker driver itself. In some loudspeaker designs, a hole is cut at the center of the parabolic dish, or damping material placed, such that no sound is reflected directly at the speaker driver. Parabolic source A loudspeaker can be constructed with multiple speaker drivers arrayed on the surface of a parabolic dish. This type of loudspeaker does not reflect sound—it aims sound directly at the audience. As in non-parabolic arrays of drivers, the signal going to each of the multiple drivers can be digitally delayed relative to its neighbors to achieve beam steering, and thus to adjust the aiming point or coverage pattern of the parabolic array without physically changing its position or curvature. The expense of a multiple driver loudspeaker is typically higher than a reflector-type parabolic dish due to the increased number of speaker driver components and amplifier channels. Sonic weapon The first use of a parabolic reflector in directing sound energy as a weapon was the Luftkanone designed by the German military during World War II. Its purpose was to emit a focused pulse of sonic energy directed from the ground to aircraft overhead, and to knock the aircraft out of the sky. The system for creating a shock wave of sonic energy relied on the combustion of methane and oxygen, with a frequency range of 800–1500 pulses per second. The parabolic reflector was in diameter.Altmann, Jürgen. \\"Acoustic Weapons—A Prospective Assessment: Sources, Propagation, and Effects of Strong Sound\\" Experimentelle Physik III. Universität Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany It failed as a weapon, primarily because its range was not sufficient. Modern sonic weapons such the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) rely on multiple loudspeaker drivers for increased sound power, and may array them in a flat plane rather than on a parabolic surface. Such weapons do not use parabolic reflectors which necessarily limit the number of drivers—a large area of drivers aimed at the reflector would occlude the parabolic dish. Museum exhibits Since 1986, parabolic loudspeakers have been designed to give museum exhibits a very focused sound field so that each exhibit can send sound to just one or two museum-goers without having too much interference and an increase in background noise. A typical installation involves one parabolic dish hanging above the area where people would be standing—sound is directed straight down. Some designs use a dual-focus dish to expand the sound field slightly beyond an ideal plane wave, while others incorporate dual drivers and amplifiers in a hemispheric dome to achieve a degree of stereophonic sound at the listener.Brown Innovations. The Localizer's hemispheric dome. How It Works. Retrieved on August 18, 2009.

Its frequency response was 500–15,000 Hz; the region below 500 Hz was to be covered by other loudspeaker types. The sound wave output was not perfectly planar—it spread out at a narrow 10° angle such that at , the area of coverage was a circle in diameter, with 110 dB SPL reported at that distance by an independent critic. The SB-1 was designed to direct 100 dB SPL , or 116 dB SPL , depending on atmospheric conditions, and so eliminate the need for delay speakers.Meyer Sound.

In 2002, Meyer Sound produced the SB-2, a bi-amplified loudspeaker which uses a parabolic dish as the front face of the enclosure. Slightly smaller than the SB-1, the SB-2 uses 28 drivers arrayed on the surface of the parabola combined with a coaxial horn with a throat and a voice coil. Similar to the SB-1, the SB-2 preserves pattern control from 500 Hz up to 16 kHz, with a 20° angle of dispersion, complemented by more widely dispersed low frequency sound down to 130 Hz.

Retrieved on August 18, 2009. Industrial testing A parabolic loudspeaker can be used to test the sound-damping characteristics of materials used for soundproofing. A parabolic loudspeaker is aimed at the material under test, and a parabolic microphone is used to pick up the sound detected on the other side of the material. The difference between the emitted sound and the picked up sound is analyzed to determine the sound-damping qualities of the material. The narrow directionality of the parabolic loudspeaker and microphone aid in reducing the amount of stray sound that could skew test results.McElroy, D. L.; Joseph F. Kimpflen.

It could transmit administrative and military messages by optical signal over a distance of nearly . The telegraph line comprised 62 stations each furnished with a signal mast with six cable-operated arms. The stations were equipped with telescopes that operators used to copy coded messages and forward them to the next station. Three dispatch departments (telegraphische Expeditionen) located in Berlin, Cologne and Koblenz handled the coding and decoding of official telegrams. Although electric telegraphy made the system obsolete for military use, simplified semaphores were still used for railway signals. Historical background At the time of construction of the Prussian semaphore system, the technology had already been known for thirty years. It was based on earlier designs by Claude Chappe and his brother which were in use in France on many telegraph lines from 1794. Soon Sweden, Denmark, and England also had working optical telegraph systems while couriers remained in use throughout Germany. The states that existed in German-speaking areas at the end of the 18th century were uninterested in a communications system that crossed multiple borders and the political conditions did not exist to put the necessary treaties and agreements in place among these states. Countries such as Sweden, England and France had the necessary centralized control for such a project, and they confronted political, military and economic challenges such as securing long coastlines, and controlling sea routes. They were therefore far more motivated to build an advanced communications network. Prussia was at that time the second largest German state in terms of area and it saw no structural or political necessity for the introduction of telegraphy after the Congress of Vienna of 1814-1815. Plans for the construction of a first telegraph line were delayed by resistance from the conservative Prussian military, even when the usefulness of mobile telegraphy in war is taken into account. It was exactly this technology that was used with success by Napoleon Bonaparte and this at least awakened the interest of the Prussian military. However, Prussia was confronted with a fragile domestic political situation in its western provinces at the beginning of the 1830s. Nobles and liberals from the Rhine region were opposed to the administration in Berlin. They were strengthened in their movement for a national constitution by the July Revolution in France and the revolution in Belgium in 1830. In this time of turmoil, urgent official messages traveled slowly by courier on horseback. This was unsatisfactory to the Prussian military, therefore, the proponents of a telegraph network could finally execute a plan for a line from Berlin to Koblenz via Cologne. The technical idea and the initiative to build the then longest telegraph line in central Europe came from the Geheime Postrat Carl Philipp Heinrich Pistor. Pistor wrote a memorandum to the Prussian General Staff in December 1830 which laid out a draft proposal for a telegraph line within the Royal Prussian States. Pistor’s ideas were inspired by the Englishman Bernard L. Watson whose designs were based on the \\"Second Polygrammatic Telegraph\\" of William Pasley. The design went back to 1810 and consisted of a mast with six telegraph arms. Pistor took the six-arm principle and thoroughly reworked the mechanics of the construction. Further, his workshop developed the optical telescopes which were a necessary component of the system. The order for the construction of the system was finally given by an order of the Prussian Cabinet on July 21, 1832. The Prussian system remained the only state-run optical telegraph system within German territory. There were also a couple of examples of privately run systems. The first existed between 1837 and 1850 and was created by the Altona businessman Johann Ludwig Schmidt who operated it as a signal system for ships between the mouth of the Elbe at Cuxhaven and Port of Hamburg. From 1841, this system was run by Friedrich Clemens Gerke, a pioneer in telegraphy for whom the modern telecommunications tower in Cuxhaven is named. The second, also created by Schmidt was inaugurated in 1847. This system ran between Bremen and Bremerhaven, but this second system was taken out of service by 1852 because a competing electric telegraph line that was placed into service at almost the same time. Construction and function As with later telegraph operations, the responsibility for the construction of the entire system fell to the Prussian Military. Major Franz August O'Etzel led the construction. O'Etzel studied in Berlin and Paris and trained as pharmacist. He knew the Rhineland as he had previously done survey work in the region. Along with the construction, O'Etzel also concerned himself with the necessary codes for transmitting messages. He wrote the codebooks for the line. Once construction was complete, he was given the title of \\"Director of the Royal Prussian Telegraph\\" and he oversaw the operations of the entire system. Route The line began with Station #1 at the old Berlin Observatory in Dorotheenstrasse. The construction of the first section – with fourteen stations – was completed by November 1832. The route ran via the Telegraphenberg #4 in Potsdam across Brandenburg an der Havel to Magdeburg. The locations of the stations were chosen by O'Etzel himself. In choosing, he took into consideration of existing structures - for example the village church in Dahlem. He also had his team construct towers on existing tall buildings. In many places along the route, trees had to be felled or have their tops cut off in order to maintain the sight lines between stations. French telegraph operators had already recognized that signals were hard to recognize if they came from stations placed before certain backgrounds, while signals from stations against an open sky were much easier to recognize. For this reason, the Prussian stations were built on higher ground where necessary. Later, such places were often designated as \\"Telegrafenberg\\" as with Glidow (station #5) or station #13 southeast of Biederitz. Because the receipt and distribution of messages was intended only for dispatch stations at the beginning and end of the line, no great value was placed on connecting smaller localities and cities. Frequently, stations were placed away from settled areas. The last station of the first section was constructed on the tower of the Johannis-Kirche in Magdeburg. To hasten construction of the second and longer section between Magdeburg and Koblenz, the finance minister as well as the interior minister ordered all their subordinates to offer their total cooperation to the construction leadership. This was done to avoid time-consuming territorial conflicts between local authorities. If an agreement over the acquisition of a piece of land for the construction of a new station was not possible, expropriation of private lands could be undertaken in the worst case. The line ran north of Egeln (Schloss Ampfurth), through Halberstadt, Goslar, Höxter to station #31 near Entrup where it turned in a southwesterly direction just before reaching Paderborn after crossing the Weser Uplands. Subsequently, it ran along the southern side of a line connecting Salzkotten, Erwitte, Soest, Werl, Iserlohn, Hagen, Schwelm and Lennep it made its way finally to Cologne via the stations Schlebusch (station #49), and Flittard (#50). From there he route ran parallel to the east bank of the Rhine via Spich to Ehrenbreitstein. The final station (#60) was built into the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress. After the completion of construction and the start of operations of the whole system in 1833, it quickly became clear that the Rhine ferry crossing to Koblenz presented a major hold up in telegraphic traffic. This could only be solved by expanding the line with an end station in Koblenz. In the same year, station #61 was put into service in the Electoral Palace in Koblenz, which was then used as a barracks. The palace also served as the administrative offices for the western section of the route. The route traveled over Hanoverian domain at stations #22 and #23 in Schladen and Liebenburg. Likewise, stations #23 through #28 lay in the domain of the Duchy of Brunswick. Negotiations with both governments for the acquisition of land and the construction of stations quickly met with success. Additionally, two stations were economized within the Brunswick domain by increasing the distance between stations #23, 24, and 25. After a year of service, it became clear that the wide interval between these stations led to frequent interruptions in visual contact during drizzly and grey weather. In 1842 this problem was solved with the construction of station #24a near Mechtshausen. The entire route now comprised 62 stations. They were on average apart with the longest distance separating stations at and the shortest at . There were only two dispatch stations, one at each end of the line. Koblenz was the seat of the Oberpräsident of the Rhine Province and the western headquarters of the Prussian defense force. Messages could neither be sent nor received from the obviously larger and more important economic and transportation center of Cologne. Messages arriving in Cologne from England or Belgium addressed to Berlin had to first be sent by courier to Koblenz and then from there telegraphed again through Cologne to Berlin. This whole process caused a day’s delay. Hence, in 1836, a third dispatch bureau was opened at the Cologne telegraph station of St. Pantleon. full route of the telegraph line across Germany Stations The common functional element of all of the telegraph stations was the ca. high softwood mast. The mast carried the six telegraph arms - also known as indicators - and it also held the control mechanism for the arms. A ring was fastened between the top two sets of signal arms to which was attached four cables that were secured to the four corners of the station roof. This provided additional stability to the mast during storms. The mast and control mechanism ran through the roof of the observation room. The roof was specially sealed against rain. The mast was secured to the floor beams and likewise the roof with cast iron hardware. Indicators and their control groundposition of arms to display \\"0–6\\" example \\"7–9\\" The moving signal arms were suspended with counterweights to enable easy adjustment. The indicators measured 1.74 m × 0.33 m. Only two of the original indicators still exist today; one is on display in the Boerdemuseum in Ummendorf and the other in the Museum for Communication in Berlin. These arms, as well as preserved construction drawings, suggest that the arms consisted of a wooden framework with a wood or sheet metal interior. This provided greater wind resistance. The operating mechanism of the system was located at the bottom of the mast in the observation room of the station. The indicators were operated with six adjustable levers arranged above each other in pairs. The position of each lever corresponded to the three-level alignment of the signal arms on the mast above. The levers and signal arms were connected by hemp ropes and later by wire cables. The levers each were lockable in four different positions, that exactly corresponded to the position of signal arm: 0° (arm hanging downward parallel to the mast), 45°, 90° (perpendicular to the mast), and 135°. Each position was relative to the mast. telegraph-alphabet with German \\"Umlaute\\" Scopes Each station had two telescopes for observing the neighboring stations. The scopes were either of English construction or they came from Pistor’s workshop. The portion of the route between Cologne and Koblenz was outfitted chiefly with scopes from the Munich lens-maker Georg Merz. The scopes’ magnification is estimated at between 40 and 60x. As with the other technical aspects of the stations, very specific instructions existed at each for the storage, use, and care of the scopes. Twelve paragraphs of instruction were allotted to the scopes alone. Station clocks and time synchronization \\"Berlin Time\\" was the authoritative time used along the entire telegraph line; with a time- synchronizing message coming from Berlin every three days at the latest. A Schwarzwald Clock with a chime hung in each station as the official station clock. The synchronization process would be announced an hour in advance with a signal which prompted the station agents to continuously observe the neighboring station in the direction of Berlin. The signal had to then be sent to the next station without delay. Once the signal reached Koblenz, it was relayed back to Berlin as confirmation. In good weather conditions, the entire process from Berlin to Koblenz and back took less than two minutes. With such a synchronization process, the time difference amounted to less than one minute.

Biography Early battles Implicated in a 1919 conspiracy to overthrow the president Gómez, he spent four years participating in a guerrilla war from the mountains of his native Falcón State. He went into exile in 1923, in Havana and Barranquilla, before returning in 1925, following an amnesty. A new attempt to overthrow Gómez in 1928 saw Urbina deported to Barranquilla, where was imprisoned pending extradition, but escaped. In 1929, he led the taking of Fort Amsterdam in Curaçao and the kidnapping of the Dutch governor, Leonardus Albert Fruytier, in another failed attempt to overthrow Gómez involving 250 men with the support of communists as Gustavo Machado Morales and Miguel Otero Silva. They plundered weapons, ammunition and the treasury of the island, and hauled the governor off to Venezuela on the stolen American ship Maracaibo.. The revolutionaries landing at La Vela de Coro (Falcon State) but were defeated by Gómez forces conducted by General Leon Jurado, and the raid ended in failure. In 1930, exiled in Mexico, Urbina established relations with personalities as General Saturnino Cedillo, General Perez Treviño and General Arturo Bernal, who offered to support his plans for a new invasion of Venezuela. In October 1931, along with 137 Mexican braceros and eight Venezuelans, it landing at Puerto Gutiérrez (Falcon State) and takes Capatárida being defeated once more by the troops of the general Leon Jurado, before which he fled the country again. Return to Venezuela and kidnappings Fort Amsterdam Urbina returned to Venezuela in 1936, offering his services to Eleazar López Contreras, including the denunciation of communists as his former associates Gustavo Machado Morales. He opposed the 1945 Venezuelan coup d'état, and after seeking asylum in the Haitian embassy, sought exile in Barranquilla and Santo Domingo, where he sought the help of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo in planning another invasion of Venezuela. He returned to Venezuela following the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état, and unsuccessfully requested the return of his assets, which had been confiscated in 1945. In November 13, 1950 he was involved in the failed kidnapping attempt of then Venezuelan President Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, which resulted in the death of Delgado.

The inside of the thylakoid membrane is called the lumen, and outside the thylakoid membrane is the stroma, where the light-independent reactions take place. The thylakoid membrane contains some integral membrane protein complexes that catalyze the light reactions. There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane: Photosystem II (PSII), Cytochrome b6f complex, Photosystem I (PSI), and ATP synthase. These four complexes work together to ultimately create the products ATP and NADPH. The four photosystems absorb light energy through pigments—primarily the chlorophylls, which are responsible for the green color of leaves. The light-dependent reactions begin in photosystem II. When a chlorophyll a molecule within the reaction center of PSII absorbs a photon, an electron in this molecule attains an excited energy level. Because this state of an electron is very unstable, the electron is transferred from one to another molecule creating a chain of redox reactions, called an electron transport chain (ETC). The electron flow goes from PSII to cytochrome b6f to PSI. In PSI, the electron gets the energy from another photon. The final electron acceptor is NADP. In oxygenic photosynthesis, the first electron donor is water, creating oxygen as a waste product. In anoxygenic photosynthesis various electron donors are used. Cytochrome b6f and ATP synthase work together to create ATP. This process is called photophosphorylation, which occurs in two different ways. In non-cyclic photophosphorylation, cytochrome b6f uses the energy of electrons from PSII to pump protons from the stroma to the lumen. The proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane creates a proton-motive force, used by ATP synthase to form ATP. In cyclic photophosphorylation, cytochrome b6f uses the energy of electrons from not only PSII but also PSI to create more ATP and to stop the production of NADPH. Cyclic phosphorylation is important to create ATP and maintain NADPH in the right proportion for the light-independent reactions. The net-reaction of all light-dependent reactions in oxygenic photosynthesis is: :2 + 2 + 3ADP + 3Pi → + 2NADPH + 3ATP The two photosystems are protein complexes that absorb photons and are able to use this energy to create a photosynthetic electron transport chain. Photosystem I and II are very similar in structure and function. They use special proteins, called light-harvesting complexes, to absorb the photons with very high effectiveness. If a special pigment molecule in a photosynthetic reaction center absorbs a photon, an electron in this pigment attains the excited state and then is transferred to another molecule in the reaction center. This reaction, called photoinduced charge separation, is the start of the electron flow and is unique because it transforms light energy into chemical forms. Light dependent reactions In chemistry, many reactions depend on the absorption of photons to provide the energy needed to overcome the activation energy barrier and hence can be labelled light-dependent. Such reactions range from the silver halide reactions used in photographic film to the creation and destruction of ozone in the upper atmosphere. This article discusses a specific subset of these, the series of light-dependent reactions related to photosynthesis in living organisms. The reaction center The reaction center is in the thylakoid membrane. It transfers light energy to a dimer of chlorophyll pigment molecules near the periplasmic (or thylakoid lumen) side of the membrane. This dimer is called a special pair because of its fundamental role in photosynthesis. This special pair is slightly different in PSI and PSII reaction center. In PSII, it absorbs photons with a wavelength of 680 nm, and it is therefore called P680. In PSI, it absorbs photons at 700 nm, and it is called P700. In bacteria, the special pair is called P760, P840, P870, or P960. \\"P\\" here means pigment, and the number following it is the wavelength of light absorbed. If an electron of the special pair in the reaction center becomes excited, it cannot transfer this energy to another pigment using resonance energy transfer. In normal circumstances, the electron should return to the ground state, but, because the reaction center is arranged so that a suitable electron acceptor is nearby, the excited electron can move from the initial molecule to the acceptor. This process results in the formation of a positive charge on the special pair (due to the loss of an electron) and a negative charge on the acceptor and is, hence, referred to as photoinduced charge separation. In other words, electrons in pigment molecules can exist at specific energy levels. Under normal circumstances, they exist at the lowest possible energy level they can. However, if there is enough energy to move them into the next energy level, they can absorb that energy and occupy that higher energy level. The light they absorb contains the necessary amount of energy needed to push them into the next level. Any light that does not have enough or has too much energy cannot be absorbed and is reflected. The electron in the higher energy level, however, does not want to be there; the electron is unstable and must return to its normal lower energy level. To do this, it must release the energy that has put it into the higher energy state to begin with. This can happen various ways. The extra energy can be converted into molecular motion and lost as heat. Some of the extra energy can be lost as heat energy, while the rest is lost as light. (This re-emission of light energy is called fluorescence.) The energy, but not the e- itself, can be passed onto another molecule. (This is called resonance.) The energy and the e- can be transferred to another molecule. Plant pigments usually utilize the last two of these reactions to convert the sun's energy into their own. This initial charge separation occurs in less than 10 picoseconds (10−11 seconds). In their high-energy states, the special pigment and the acceptor could undergo charge recombination; that is, the electron on the acceptor could move back to neutralize the positive charge on the special pair. Its return to the special pair would waste a valuable high-energy electron and simply convert the absorbed light energy into heat. In the case of PSII, this backflow of electrons can produce reactive oxygen species leading to photoinhibition. Three factors in the structure of the reaction center work together to suppress charge recombination nearly completely. * Another electron acceptor is less than 10 Å away from the first acceptor, and so the electron is rapidly transferred farther away from the special pair. * An electron donor is less than 10 Å away from the special pair, and so the positive charge is neutralized by the transfer of another electron * The electron transfer back from the electron acceptor to the positively charged special pair is especially slow. The rate of an electron transfer reaction increases with its thermodynamic favorability up to a point and then decreases. The back transfer is so favourable that it takes place in the inverted region where electron- transfer rates become slower. Thus, electron transfer proceeds efficiently from the first electron acceptor to the next, creating an electron transport chain that ends if it has reached NADPH. In chloroplasts The photosynthesis process in chloroplasts begins when an electron of P680 of PSII attains a higher-energy level. This energy is used to reduce a chain of electron acceptors that have subsequently lowered redox-potentials. This chain of electron acceptors is known as an electron transport chain. When this chain reaches PS I, an electron is again excited, creating a high redox-potential. The electron transport chain of photosynthesis is often put in a diagram called the z-scheme, because the redox diagram from P680 to P700 resembles the letter Z. The final product of PSII is plastoquinol, a mobile electron carrier in the membrane. Plastoquinol transfers the electron from PSII to the proton pump, cytochrome b6f. The ultimate electron donor of PSII is water. Cytochrome b6f proceeds the electron chain to PSI through plastocyanin molecules. PSI is able to continue the electron transfer in two different ways. It can transfer the electrons either to plastoquinol again, creating a cyclic electron flow, or to an enzyme called FNR (Ferredoxin—NADP(+) reductase), creating a non- cyclic electron flow. PSI releases FNR into the stroma, where it reduces to NADPH. Activities of the electron transport chain, especially from cytochrome b6f, lead to pumping of protons from the stroma to the lumen. The resulting transmembrane proton gradient is used to make ATP via ATP synthase. The overall process of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplasts is: → PS II → plastoquinone → cyt b6f → plastocyanin → PS I → NADPH Photosystem II PS II is extremely complex, a highly organized transmembrane structure that contains a water-splitting complex, chlorophylls and carotenoid pigments, a reaction center (P680), pheophytin (a pigment similar to chlorophyll), and two quinones. It uses the energy of sunlight to transfer electrons from water to a mobile electron carrier in the membrane called plastoquinone: ' → P680' → P680* → plastoquinone Plastoquinone, in turn, transfers electrons to cyt b6f, which feeds them into PS I. The water-splitting complex The step → P680 is performed by a poorly understood structure embedded within PS II called the water-splitting complex or the oxygen-evolving complex. It catalyzes a reaction that splits water into electrons, protons and oxygen: 2 → 4H+ \\\\+ 4e− \\\\+ ' The actual steps of the above reaction are running in the following way (Dolai's diagram of S-states): (I) 2(monoxide) (II) OH. (hydroxide) (III) (peroxide) (IV)(super oxide)(V) (di-oxygen). (Dolai's mechanism) The electrons are transferred to special chlorophyll molecules (embedded in PS II) that are promoted to a higher-energy state by the energy of photons. The reaction center The excitation P680 → P680*of the reaction center pigment P680 occurs here. These special chlorophyll molecules embedded in PS II absorb the energy of photons, with maximal absorption at 680 nm. Electrons within these molecules are promoted to a higher-energy state. This is one of two core processes in photosynthesis, and it occurs with astonishing efficiency (greater than 90%) because, in addition to direct excitation by light at 680 nm, the energy of light first harvested by antenna proteins at other wavelengths in the light-harvesting system is also transferred to these special chlorophyll molecules. This is followed by the step P680*→ pheophytin, and then on to plastoquinone, which occurs within the reaction center of PS II. High-energy electrons are transferred to plastoquinone before it subsequently picks up two protons to become plastoquinol. Plastoquinol is then released into the membrane as a mobile electron carrier. This is the second core process in photosynthesis. The initial stages occur within picoseconds, with an efficiency of 100%. The seemingly impossible efficiency is due to the precise positioning of molecules within the reaction center. This is a solid-state process, not a chemical reaction. It occurs within an essentially crystalline environment created by the macromolecular structure of PS II. The usual rules of chemistry (which involve random collisions and random energy distributions) do not apply in solid-state environments. Link of water-splitting complex and chlorophyll excitation When the chlorophyll passes the electron to pheophytin, it obtains an electron from P680*. In turn, P680* can oxidize the Z (or YZ) molecule. Once oxidized, the Z molecule can derive electrons from the oxygen- evolving complex (OEC). Dolai's S-state diagrams show the reactions of water splitting in the oxygen-evolving complex. Summary PS II is a transmembrane structure found in all chloroplasts. It splits water into electrons, protons and molecular oxygen. The electrons are transferred to plastoquinone, which carries them to a proton pump. Molecular oxygen is released into the atmosphere. The emergence of such an incredibly complex structure, a macromolecule that converts the energy of sunlight into potentially useful work with efficiencies that are impossible in ordinary experience, seems almost magical at first glance. Thus, it is of considerable interest that, in essence, the same structure is found in purple bacteria. Cytochrome b6f PS II and PS I are connected by a transmembrane proton pump, cytochrome b6f complex (plastoquinol—plastocyanin reductase; ). Electrons from PS II are carried by plastoquinol to cyt b6f, where they are removed in a stepwise fashion (reforming plastoquinone) and transferred to a water-soluble electron carrier called plastocyanin. This redox process is coupled to the pumping of four protons across the membrane. The resulting proton gradient (together with the proton gradient produced by the water- splitting complex in PS II) is used to make ATP via ATP synthase. The structure and function of cytochrome b6f (in chloroplasts) is very similar to cytochrome bc1 (Complex III in mitochondria). Both are transmembrane structures that remove electrons from a mobile, lipid-soluble electron carrier (plastoquinone in chloroplasts; ubiquinone in mitochondria) and transfer them to a mobile, water-soluble electron carrier (plastocyanin in chloroplasts; cytochrome c in mitochondria). Both are proton pumps that produce a transmembrane proton gradient. In fact, cytochrome b6 and subunit IV are homologous to mitochondrial cytochrome b and the Rieske iron-sulfur proteins of the two complexes are homologous. However, cytochrome f and cytochrome c1 are not homologous. Photosystem I The cyclic light-dependent reactions occur only when the sole photosystem being used is photosystem I. Photosystem I excites electrons which then cycle from the transport protein, ferredoxin (Fd), to the cytochrome complex, b6f, to another transport protein, plastocyanin (Pc), and back to photosystem I. A proton gradient is created across the thylakoid membrane (6) as protons (3) are transported from the chloroplast stroma (4) to the thylakoid lumen (5). Through chemiosmosis, ATP (9) is produced where ATP synthase (1) binds an inorganic phosphate group (8) to an ADP molecule (7). PS I accepts electrons from plastocyanin and transfers them either to NADPH (noncyclic electron transport) or back to cytochrome b6f (cyclic electron transport): plastocyanin → P700 → P700* → FNR → NADPH ↑ ↓ b6f ← plastoquinone PS I, like PS II, is a complex, highly organized transmembrane structure that contains antenna chlorophylls, a reaction center (P700), phylloquinine, and a number of iron-sulfur proteins that serve as intermediate redox carriers. The light-harvesting system of PS I uses multiple copies of the same transmembrane proteins used by PS II. The energy of absorbed light (in the form of delocalized, high-energy electrons) is funneled into the reaction center, where it excites special chlorophyll molecules (P700, maximum light absorption at 700 nm) to a higher energy level. The process occurs with astonishingly high efficiency. Electrons are removed from excited chlorophyll molecules and transferred through a series of intermediate carriers to ferredoxin, a water-soluble electron carrier. As in PS II, this is a solid- state process that operates with 100% efficiency. There are two different pathways of electron transport in PS I. In noncyclic electron transport, ferredoxin carries the electron to the enzyme ferredoxin reductase (FNR) that reduces to NADPH. In cyclic electron transport, electrons from ferredoxin are transferred (via plastoquinone) to a proton pump, cytochrome b6f. They are then returned (via plastocyanin) to P700. NADPH and ATP are used to synthesize organic molecules from . The ratio of NADPH to ATP production can be adjusted by adjusting the balance between cyclic and noncyclic electron transport. It is noteworthy that PS I closely resembles photosynthetic structures found in green sulfur bacteria, just as PS II resembles structures found in purple bacteria. In bacteria PS II, PS I, and cytochrome b6f are found in chloroplasts. All plants and all photosynthetic algae contain chloroplasts, which produce NADPH and ATP by the mechanisms described above. In essence, the same transmembrane structures are also found in cyanobacteria. Unlike plants and algae, cyanobacteria are prokaryotes. They do not contain chloroplasts. Rather, they bear a striking resemblance to chloroplasts themselves. This suggests that organisms resembling cyanobacteria were the evolutionary precursors of chloroplasts. One imagines primitive eukaryotic cells taking up cyanobacteria as intracellular symbionts in a process known as endosymbiosis. Cyanobacteria Cyanobacteria contain both PS I and PS II. Their light- harvesting system is different from that found in plants (they use phycobilins, rather than chlorophylls, as antenna pigments), but their electron transport chain ' → PS II → plastoquinone →' b6f → cytochrome c6 → PS I → ferredoxin → NADPH ↑ ↓ b6f ← plastoquinone is, in essence, the same as the electron transport chain in chloroplasts. The mobile water-soluble electron carrier is cytochrome c6 in cyanobacteria, plastocyanin in plants. Cyanobacteria can also synthesize ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, in the manner of other bacteria. The electron transport chain is NADH dehydrogenase → plastoquinone → b6f → cyt c6 → cyt aa3 → '''''' where the mobile electron carriers are plastoquinone and cytochrome c6, while the proton pumps are NADH dehydrogenase, cyt b6f and cytochrome aa3 (member of the COX3 family). Cyanobacteria are the only bacteria that produce oxygen during photosynthesis. Earth's primordial atmosphere was anoxic. Organisms like cyanobacteria produced our present-day oxygen-containing atmosphere. The other two major groups of photosynthetic bacteria, purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria, contain only a single photosystem and do not produce oxygen. Purple bacteria Purple bacteria contain a single photosystem that is structurally related to PS II in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts: : P870 → P870* → ubiquinone → cyt bc1 → cyt c2 → P870 This is a cyclic process in which electrons are removed from an excited chlorophyll molecule (bacteriochlorophyll; P870), passed through an electron transport chain to a proton pump (cytochrome bc1 complex; similar to the chloroplastic one), and then returned to the chlorophyll molecule. The result is a proton gradient, which is used to make ATP via ATP synthase. As in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, this is a solid-state process that depends on the precise orientation of various functional groups within a complex transmembrane macromolecular structure. To make NADPH, purple bacteria use an external electron donor (hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, sulfite, or organic molecules such as succinate and lactate) to feed electrons into a reverse electron transport chain. Green sulfur bacteria Green sulfur bacteria contain a photosystem that is analogous to PS I in chloroplasts: P840 → P840* → ferredoxin → NADH ↑ ↓ cyt c553 ← bc1 ← menaquinone There are two pathways of electron transfer. In cyclic electron transfer, electrons are removed from an excited chlorophyll molecule, passed through an electron transport chain to a proton pump, and then returned to the chlorophyll. The mobile electron carriers are, as usual, a lipid-soluble quinone and a water-soluble cytochrome. The resulting proton gradient is used to make ATP. In noncyclic electron transfer, electrons are removed from an excited chlorophyll molecule and used to reduce NAD+ to NADH. The electrons removed from P840 must be replaced. This is accomplished by removing electrons from , which is oxidized to sulfur (hence the name \\"green sulfur bacteria\\"). Purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria occupy relatively minor ecological niches in the present day biosphere. They are of interest because of their importance in precambrian ecologies, and because their methods of photosynthesis were the likely evolutionary precursors of those in modern plants. History The first ideas about light being used in photosynthesis were proposed by Colin Flannery in 1779 who recognized it was sunlight falling on plants that was required, although Joseph Priestley had noted the production of oxygen without the association with light in 1772. Cornelis Van Niel proposed in 1931 that photosynthesis is a case of general mechanism where a photon of light is used to photo decompose a hydrogen donor and the hydrogen being used to reduce . Then in 1939, Robin Hill showed that isolated chloroplasts would make oxygen, but not fix showing the light and dark reactions occurred in different places. Although they are referred to as light and dark reactions, both of them take place only in the presence of light. This led later to the discovery of photosystems I and II.

Biography He was born in Chicago. A graduate of DuSable High School, he was in a \\"baby band\\" with Johnny Griffin and Wilbur Campbell in the spring of 1944. Returning from military service in 1946, he led a series of combos in Chicago. He often played the Pershing Ballroom in a battle-of-the-saxes format. His dueling partners included Gene Ammons, Tom Archia, Von Freeman and, on several occasions, his idol Lester Young. His own band featured pianist Wild Bill Davis and drummer Eldridge \\"Bruz\\" Freeman in 1947 and 1948. McLin's high visibility on the South Side club scene eventually led to recording opportunities with Aristocrat and Chess. A 1949 session was done with singer and pianist Laura Rucker while McLin's band was working at Leonard Chess's Macomba Lounge. McLin went on to make three sessions under his own name in 1950 and 1951. His rendition of \\"Mona Lisa\\" (recorded July 1950) hit the charts, but \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" (from the second session, in November 1950) did not repeat its commercial success, and his third session was left unissued at the time. He also played on the legendary unreleased jazz session for Parkway under the leadership of Bennie Green, and in October 1950 a live recording from the Pershing Ballroom found him subbing for Von Freeman in the company of visiting headliner Charlie Parker. In 1952 McLin, who was having trouble finding enough engagements in Chicago to support his family, moved to Los Angeles, where for a decade his combos found steady work. He appeared on an Amos Milburn session for Aladdin Records in 1954, with Red Callender on bass. In 1958 he recorded two singles for Golden Tone with the organ trio lineup that was then coming into fashion, and two blues for Dootsie Williams' Dootone label in 1958. In 1960, he recorded a single for his own Mac-Jac label. There is also a second Claude McLin single on Mac-Jac, probably recorded three or four years later. He also recorded at least five singles between 1960 and 1962 for a small label called Allegro.Büttner, Armin and Nations, Opal Louis: \\"The Cawthron, C&C; and Allegro labels\\" http://www.jazzdocumentation.ch/allegro/cawthron.html McLin made his last recording session, for Dooto in 1964; as a sign that the times were changing, he recorded a pop ballad on one side and a piece of eccentric garage rock on the other. He retired from music in the late 1960s, when popular demand for jazz had reached a low point, and worked other jobs in the Los Angeles area for the rest of his life.Campbell, Robert L.; Büttner, Armin and Pruter, Robert \\"The Claude McLin Discography\\" He died in Los Angeles in 1995.

Dick. The novel uses the common science fiction concept of a human colony on Mars. However, it also includes the themes of mental illness, the physics of time and the dangers of centralized authority. The novel was first published under the title All We Marsmen, serialized in the August, October and December 1963 issues of Worlds of Tomorrow magazine. The subsequent 1964 publication as Martian Time-Slip is virtually identical, with different chapter breaks.All We Marsmen Plot summary Jack Bohlen is a repairman who emigrated to Mars to flee from his bouts of schizophrenia. He lives with a wife and a young son. His father Leo visits Mars to stake a claim to the seemingly worthless Franklin D. Roosevelt mountain range after receiving an insider tip that the United Nations plans to build a huge apartment complex there. The complex will be called \\"AM-WEB\\", a contraction of the German phrase \\"Alle Menschen werden Brüder\\" (All men become brothers) from Schiller's An die Freude (Ode to Joy). Bohlen has a chance encounter with Arnie Kott, the hard-nosed leader of the Water Workers' Union, when both Bohlen’s and Kott’s helicopters are called to assist a group of critically dehydrated Bleekmen, the \\"original\\" inhabitants of Mars who are thought to be genetically similar to the African Bushmen of Earth. Bohlen rebukes Kott for his hesitance to help the Bleekmen, an act that angers Kott. After visiting with his ex-wife Anne Esterhazy about their own \\"anomalous\\" child, Kott hears of the theories of Dr. Milton Glaub, a psychotherapist at Camp Ben-Gurion, an institution for those afflicted with pervasive developmental disorders. Glaub believes that mental illnesses may be altered states of time perception. Kott becomes interested in Manfred Steiner, an autistic boy at Camp B-G in the hopes that the boy can predict the future-- a skill Kott would find useful to his business ventures. Since Camp B-G is scheduled for closure, Kott offers to take Manfred off Glaub's hands. Manfred in turn is afraid of a future only he can see, in which Mars is derelict and the AM-WEB is a dumping ground for forgotten people like him, where he will eventually be confined as a decrepit old man to a bed on life-support. Kott leases Bohlen's contract from his current employers and hires him to build a video device that can help Manfred perceive time at a regular pace (Kott is also ultimately intent on getting revenge on Bohlen). Bohlen takes a liking to Manfred but the assignment stresses him out because he fears that contact with the mentally ill may cause him to relapse. Bohlen also begins an affair with Kott’s mistress. As an assignment from his regular job as a repairman, Bohlen is sent to service the simulacra at the Public School, where lessons are taught by robotic simulations of historical figures. These figures are deeply disturbing to Bohlen as they remind him of his own schizoid episodes where he perceived people around him as non-living mechanisms. When he takes Manfred to the school during an assignment, the simulacra begin acting strangely, as it seems Manfred is altering their reality. Eventually Bohlen is asked to take Manfred away. In light of other events it is not entirely clear, however, whether Manfred is actually affecting the simulacra or whether he is merely influencing Jack Bohlen's perception of them. Only Heliogabalus, Kott's Bleekman servant, is able to connect with Manfred. From Manfred's point of view, humans are strange beings who live in a world of fractured time where they disappear from one place and reappear in another and otherwise move in a jerky, uncoordinated manner. Heliogabalus, to Manfred, moves smoothly and gracefully. He seems to talk to Manfred without words. The precipitating event of the story is the suicide of Manfred Steiner's father Norbert which has the effect of connecting Kott to Manfred and also depriving Otto Zitte, a colleague of Norbert's, of his livelihood. The crux of the story is a meeting between Kott, Bohlen and Kott's mistress, Doreen Anderton, at Kott's home, with Manfred in tow. This episode is previewed three times before it actually occurs, apparently through Manfred's eyes but with participation by Bohlen. Each time the events are more surreal, the perceptions more hallucinatory. When the events of the story finally reach the crucial point, which Bohlen fears after having foreseen the outcome, Bohlen himself does not experience it. His awareness stops as he and Doreen arrive at Kott's home and picks up after they leave. He only knows that he and Kott parted ways, superficially friends but actually enemies. Pressured by Kott, Heliogabalus reveals that the Bleekmen's sacred rock, \\"Dirty Knobby\\", can be used as a time travel portal that Manfred may be able to open. Kott centers his interest in altering the past on two goals: Revenge on Jack Bohlen and claiming the FDR mountains before Leo Bohlen does. Returned in time to the point where he first appeared in the novel, emerging from the sybaritic bath-house run by the Union, Arnie Kott finds himself repeating the actions which led him to meeting Bohlen while simultaneously dealing with perceptual distortions which seem to be emanating from Manfred's mind. He is unable to get to the FDR mountains to plant his stake, being compelled by law to go to the aid of the Bleekmen just as he did before. He encounters Bohlen, as he did originally, but in attempting to shoot him he is \\"killed\\" by a Bleekman's arrow. Waking from the vision, Kott realizes he has failed. He decides to give up on his schemes, abandon Doreen and let Bohlen get on with his life. He still desires to help Manfred, who has wandered off during the purported \\"time-travel\\" episode. Leaving the cave in Dirty Knobby where they performed Heliogabalus's strange ritual, he encounters Otto Zitte. After the suicide of Norbert Steiner, Kott, his best customer, elected to take over Norbert's business. Zitte was competition, so Kott's men destroyed the smuggler's storage facility and the adjacent property, leaving a message that \\"Arnie Kott doesn't like what you stand for\\". Zitte has pursued Kott, following his helicopter to Dirty Knobby. He shoots Kott, who thinks he might still be stuck in another one of Manfred's hallucinations. Bohlen and Doreen land in Kott's own helicopter and take Kott back to Lewistown. Kott dies, believing to the last that he was only experiencing another hallucination. Bohlen returns to his wife, Silvia, who had been seduced by Zitte on his sales round. Despite both admitting to infidelity, Jack with Doreen and Silvia with Zitte, they decide to maintain their marriage. There is a disturbance in the Steiner home, and Steiner's widow runs screaming into the night. Barging in, Bohlen and his wife see Manfred, old and in a wheelchair, festooned with tubes, accompanied by Bleekmen. Manfred joined a group of Bleekmen after leaving Dirty Knobby, and has saved himself from AM-WEB. He has come back through time to see his family and thank Bohlen for saving him. In a subdued final scene, Bohlen and his father are out searching for Steiner's widow in the darkness, with voices \\"business-like and competent and patient.\\" Adaptations Audiobook version include: * A Martian Time-Slip audiobook — read by Grover Gardner (possibly under his alias Tom Parker), unabridged, approximately 9 hours over 6 audio cassettess — was released in 1998.Review of Martian Time-Slip By Philip K.

The company is based out of Hollywood, California, United States, and then Camden Town in London, United Kingdom. History Jim Henson's Creature Shop was originally created as a partnership with British illustrator Brian Froud to facilitate the production of The Dark Crystal. Located in Hampstead, London, it received its name in order to differentiate it from Henson's original puppet workshop in New York City. It was then used for future films such as Labyrinth and The Storyteller. It was relocated to Camden Town following Henson's death in 1990 and his son, Brian Henson, took over. A third location in Burbank, California opened to serve Hollywood, and one of its first projects was the Dinosaurs television series. Since The Jim Henson Company sold off the rights to The Muppets brand to Disney in 2004; the Muppet Workshop in New York is now credited as Jim Henson's Creature Shop. In the modern day, the New York shop specializes in hand puppets, including building The Muppets and most of the puppets in Sesame Street. The Los Angeles branch creates more realistic animatronic creatures and creature suits. In addition to practical effects, the shop also specializes in \\"digital puppetry\\", a form of computer animation that controls a digital avatar using manual puppet controls to animate them more quickly and easily than if it was entirely digital. This is known as the \\"Henson Digital Puppetry Studio\\" and is used extensively in television, including the entirety of the series Sid the Science Kid.

Delany. Publishing history An excerpt from a draft of the novel was published as \\"In the Valley of the Nest of Spiders\\" in issue 7 of Black Clock magazine. A set of typographical corrections for the published novel has already been released.http://oneringcircus.com/spiders_errata.html Plot summary The novel begins in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 6, 2007, where we meet Eric Jeffers some six days before his seventeenth birthday. Eric is living with his adoptive father, Mike. The story follows Eric as he goes to live with his mother, Barbara, in the fictive \\"Runcible County\\" on the Georgia coast. There, living in the town of \\"Diamond Harbor\\", Eric learns that a black, gay philanthropist has established a utopian community for black gay men in a neighborhood called the Dump. Eric takes a job with the local garbage man, Dynamite, and his nineteen-year-old helper, Morgan. The two boys become life partners, and the novel follows them—through job changes (from garbage men, to managing a pornographic theater, to handymen), changes of friends, and changes of address (from a cabin in the Dump, to an apartment over the movie theater, to another cabin out on Gilead, a nearby island)—into the twilight of their years.http://www.magnusbooks.com/through-the-valley.html Though it does move many decades into the future and off-handedly mentions fictional future events and technologies, the novel does not exactly fit within the realm of science fiction. Themes The title of the novel is an homage to Italo Calvino's similarly titled novel The Path to the Nest of Spiders. Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders can also be viewed as a companion piece to Dark Reflections, Delany's immediately previous novel. But where Dark Reflections centers on themes of loneliness, sexual repression, fear, and the difficult life of the artist, Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders, in sharp contrast, celebrates companionship, love, sexual openness, and freedom. Toward the end of Dark Reflections, we learn that in his youth, Arnold Hawley, the novel's protagonist, ran away in fear from a situation that would likely have changed the course of his life. Early in Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders, Eric is told a story by Bill Bottom, a neighbor of his. Bill, like Arnold, ran away from a situation that had the potential for great happiness. He concludes by asking Eric to promise that when he is presented with his own choice—and, Bill insists, that moment will come—to choose happiness, no matter how afraid he might be to take that path. The major themes of Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders are love, relationships, and the consequences—both good and bad—of taking that chance and making the choice to go after what makes you happy. Beginning relatively early in Eric's life (while he is still seventeen in the story), he repeatedly expresses a desire to do good things for other people. This is a thematic element that spans the novel. There is also a very strong tie to Baruch Spinoza. He is mentioned early in the novel, and in the latter half, Eric is given a copy of Ethica by a character named Mama Grace. Eventually, Eric reads Ethica several times. It shapes and reflects his actions and attitudes. Like The Mad Man, Hogg, and Equinox, Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders has several highly pornographic scenes. In recent interviews, Delany has stated that it is his design to have Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders straddle the lines between literature, science fiction, and pornography. Delany has said, in an interview with Kenneth James, that he was inspired to write the book by a quote from Vladimir Nabokov.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UpGok166wQ The quote occurs, in a slightly different form, in Nabokov's essay \\"On A Book Entitled Lolita\\", which is included as an afterword for the novel itself: Literary Significance and Criticism Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders quickly garnered several extremely positive reviews. Roger Bellin of the Los Angeles Review of Books finished his detailed review stating \\"Though it shouldn't be most readers' first exposure to Delany, this is nonetheless a book worthy of his career full of masterpieces — and a book that no one else could have written.\\"http://lareviewofbooks.org/review/pornotopia Steven Shaviro states that \\"it is the best English-language novel that I know of, of the 21st century so far.\\"http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=1050 Paul Di Filippo's review in Locushttp://www.locusmag.com/Reviews/2012/04/paul-di-filippo- reviews-samuel-r-delany/ and, with a few caveats regarding the sexual and \\"culturally invested\\" language in the novel, Jo Walton's review at Tor.com are also full of praise for the work.http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-good-life- samuel-r-delanys-through-the-valley-of-the-nest-of-spiders Edward Parker of Lambda Literary states that \\"Time is an important theme throughout the book. Delany has constructed the story so that time passes slowly in the beginning—the whole first half of the book covers only five of the novel’s seventy years—and then accelerates as the main characters age, structurally reflecting the human experience of time.... But I wondered occasionally, especially in the novel’s first half, whether the story could not have been told in fewer words [A passage] is certainly among the best descriptions of toastmaking that I’ve encountered, this detail didn’t seem to do much to advance what was taking place in the scene. Might the manuscript have benefited from a little more time under an editor’s gaze? On the other hand, the passage is kind of pleasing anyway, and the accumulation of such passages, perhaps, serves to construct the feeling of the slowness of time for the reader.\\".http://www.lambdaliterary.org/reviews/06/26/through-the-valley-of- the-nest-of-spiders-by-samuel-r-delany/ External links * Reading at St Marks Bookshop, NYC April 23, 2012.

It is a hamlet about from the Perkinsville Bridge over the Verde River. The Verde Canyon Railroad, a passenger excursion line, runs between Clarkdale and Perkinsville on the tracks of the Arizona Central Railroad, a shortline. The excursion train engines disconnect at Perkinsville and move along a siding to reconnect at the opposite end of the train for the return trip to Clarkdale. The track through Perkinsville is also used to haul freight between Clarkdale and Drake, on the BNSF rail system.Rail, p. 30 History Perkinsville is named for A. M. Perkins, who established a cattle ranch here in 1900. In 1912, the shortline, financed by William A. Clark to service his copper smelter in Clarkdale and his copper mine in Jerome,Rail, pp. 5-6 opened a station in Perkinsville. The railroad buildings included a depot, water tower, and the station master's house. Nearby were a limestone quarry and kiln for producing lime, used as a flux in the Clarkdale smelter. Briefly in the early 20th century Perkinsville supported an estimated 10 to 12 families. It had a small school, general store, section house, and post office. The smelter closure in the early 1950s eliminated the need for the quarry and kiln, and the advent of diesel locomotives eliminated the need for the Perkinsville water stop. The hamlet soon became a ghost town, used in the 1960s as a filming location for scenes in How the West Was Won.

He is most famous in his infant form on the animated series, but has also appeared at various other ages, including as a teenager on the early 1970s spin-off The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show and as an adult in three made-for-television movies. Cartoonist Gene Hazelton contributed to the original model sheets for the character, and he has said that he based Bamm-Bamm's design on his own son, Wes. Biography Bamm-Bamm is the adopted son of Betty and Barney Rubble after they found him left on their doorstep. After meeting his next-door neighbor Pebbles, he falls in love with her. Bamm-Bamm's \\"nickname\\" came from a note left in the basket, causing Barney and Betty confusion over the strange name. This was explained when Bamm-Bamm yelled the phrase \\"Bamm, Bamm!\\" and swung his club.\\"Little Bamm Bamm,\\" The Flintstones, season 4 Bamm-Bamm's excessive (and sometimes misused) strength was often a source of humor in the episodes in which the toddler version of Bamm-Bamm appeared. Unlike Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm was past the crawling stage and could be seen in a few episodes trying to help Pebbles walk. As a teenager, Bamm-Bamm attended Bedrock High School along with Pebbles. In this version, Bamm-Bamm's super strength, while visible in the form of his muscular physique, was not actively mentioned and was only demonstrated on occasion. He became more passive and sensible in his manner and tended to be dominated by Pebbles' more aggressive personality. He was the owner of a \\"cave buggy\\", a prehistoric version of a dune buggy.The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show, 1971-1972, CBS As an adult, Bamm-Bamm became a mechanic and married Pebbles. The two soon moved to Hollyrock (a fictionalized, prehistoric version of Hollywood) so Bamm-Bamm could pursue his true goal of becoming a screenwriter. Later, the couple had twins, Chip and Roxy. Film Pebbles Flintstone and Bamm-Bamm Rubble, from Bamm-Bamm's debut in The Flintstones season-four episode \\"Little Bamm-Bamm\\" In the 1994 live-action Flintstones movie, Bamm-Bamm appears as a four-year-old who is adopted after Fred secretly gives money to Barney and Betty to ensure that they could afford the adoption. Bamm-Bamm is seen with long, matted, filthy blond hair and only wearing a fig leaf loincloth. He was mentioned to have been raised by wild mastodons, a parody of various examples of interspecies adoption. This also hinted at how he had gained his incredible super-strength. Bamm-Bamm soon started to look like his cartoon counterpart after a bath, a haircut, and some new clothes. Bamm-Bamm was played by twins Hlynur Sigurðsson and Marinó Sigurðsson and voiced by actress E.G. Daily, who succeeded Don Messick in the role after his death. Though Bamm-Bamm did not appear in the prequel film The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, the name of the film's antagonist, Chip, is a reference to the name of Bamm-Bamm's son. Chip's mistress, Roxy, also gets her name from Bamm-Bamm and Pebbles' daughter. Chronology Through the various Flintstones incarnations, the age of Bamm- Bamm has varied wildly from spinoff to spinoff, appearing as an adolescent in one spinoff and as an infant again in the next. Arranged roughly in chronological order, the Flintstones incarnations in which Bamm-Bamm has made appearances are: Infant/toddler *The Flintstones *The Man Called Flintstone *The New Fred and Barney Show *The Flintstones' New Neighbors *The Flintstones: Fred's Final Fling *The Flintstones: Wind-Up Wilma *The Flintstones: Jogging Fever *A Flintstones Christmas Carol *Cave Kids *Fruity Pebbles, Post commercials  Child/preteen *A Flintstone Christmas *The Flintstones: Little Big League *Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs Teenager *The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show *Hanna-Barbera Educational Filmstrips featuring Bamm-Bamm: \\"Term Paper\\" and \\"Information Please\\" *The Flintstone Comedy Show *The Flintstone Funnies * The Rubbles Adult *I Yabba-Dabba Do! *Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby *A Flintstone Family Christmas Casting Bamm-Bamm's voice over the years was provided by Jay North, Don Messick, Lucille Bliss, Frank Welker, Christine Cavanaugh, Michael Sheehan, Elizabeth Daily, and Jerry Houser.

There were two fatalities amongst the crew on board. Accident The wreckage of C-47A G-AJVZ at Heyhead on the morning of 27 March 1951. The Dakota was operating a flight carrying newspapers from Ringway to Nutts Corner. On takeoff from Runway 06 in freezing conditions and light falling snow, it swung to port, failed to climb, and struck the top of a tree in Woodhouse Lane, close to the hamlet of Heyhead, half a mile from the end of the runway. Both pilots were killed. Conclusion The subsequent investigation found that the crash resulted from a loss of engine power caused by ice formation in the carburettor intakes attributable to the captain's failure to make use of the heat controls. The extended undercarriage and the presence of snow on the wings may have also been contributory factors.

The ship's steel hull was fabricated by the Canadian Ship Building Company in Toronto, Ontario and was assembled at the Gravenhurst, Ontario yard of the Muskoka Lakes Navigation and Hotel Company, the ship's owner and operator. The hull was riveted steel with a steel frame above and a wooden superstructure. She was powered by two Triple expansion steam engines and four Scotch marine boilers, developing 68.8 horsepower for a top speed of 18 mph. The Sagamo was designed with two full decks above the hull, and two additional partial decks above those. On the main deck was the galley and the dining room which seated 90 people, and the washrooms. The promenade deck above had forward and aft lounges. On the third deck was a smoking lounge. The ship could hold 800 passengers with luggage along with a crew of 26. The ship was launched on 25 July 1906 in Gravenhurst and christened Sagamo or \\"big chief\\". She was towed to the Navigation Company shipyard to be completed. Her engines were tested in October, 1906 and she took her maiden voyage on 15 June 1907. Cruising career Beginning Pilothouse of the Sagamo on her first season in 1907 with Commodore Bailey on the bridge Sagamo began her cruising career with the 1907 season, her maiden voyage taking place on 15 June under Commodore George Bailey, her first Captain.Tatley p 13 That year the Grand Trunk Railway expanded their station at Muskoka Wharf in Gravenhurst to accommodate the greater volume of traffic transferring from their trains to the Navigation Company's steamers. Flagship of the Navigation Company's line, Sagamo was the largest steamer on any of the minor lakes in Ontario. Her size restricted where she could go. For instance she made only one trip to Bala, and it was such a harrowing experience it was never repeated. She never sailed up the Muskoka River to Bracebridge. Instead the Sagamo operated as the trunk carrier of the system, carrying traffic from the Muskoka Wharf in Gravenhurst to Beaumaris, Port Carling, Windermere, the Royal Muskoka Hotel, (also owned by the Navigation Company), and finally to Port Cockburn where she would exchange passengers with some of the company's smaller steamers who would then carry them to the smaller ports of call.Tatley p 15 Sometimes the passenger exchange would take place mid-lake. World War I The outbreak of World War I brought a depression to Muskoka Lakes tourism as the country turned its resources to materiel and many young men went overseas in uniform. By this point the number of steamers run by the Navigation company had grown to nine, but an accident put the Nipissing out of commission in 1915, (permanently, as it turns out, with the hull later to be resurrected as the RMS Segwun). In 1917 reflecting lower demand and higher priorities for the war, the Grand Trunk eliminated the overnight run to Gravenhurst and the number of day trains to two. As a result, the Sagamo was laid up for the 1917 and 1918 seasons at the company's facilities in Gravenhurst. After the war business picked up, and the loss of the Kenozha and Charlie M to fire left the company with only six ships to meet demand; the Sagamo was back in business. Expanded vision In the 1922 season, Commodore Bailey retired after a 55-year career and 15 years with the Sagamo. He was replaced by Captain Ralph Lee who had been Mate under Bailey.Tatley p 153-4 Shortly thereafter Lee proposed expanding the company's vision from simple transportation of tourists to more of a cruising destination. Management agreed and purchased property at the head of Little Lake Joseph which came to be known as \\"Natural Park\\" and served as a stretching point for what came to be known as the \\"One Hundred Mile Cruise\\". The Sagamo continued to run the main route from Gravenhurst to Port Cockburn and the smaller ships acted as feeders at the various ports of call. Sightseers now disembarked for an hour at the Natural Park prior to returning to Gravenhurst in the evening.Tatley p 164 Fire Following the 1925 season when the Sagamo was being laid up for the winter she suffered the first of two major fires. A worker placed a container of oil on the stove not realizing the stove was hot. The contents eventually burst into flames which ignited the wooden superstructure, blazing quickly out of control. Despite the efforts of the Gravenhurst Fire Department, the fire consumed the bulk of the ship's superstructure forward of the stack. Damage was estimated at $75,000, but fortunately there were no injuries.Tatley p 157-8 Management chose to rebuild the ship when they discovered the engines and machinery were intact and used the opportunity to add fifteen staterooms. This allowed patrons the opportunity to board the ship in the evening so they wouldn't have to arise at 6:30 am to make the normal departure.Tatley p 158 Work was performed over the winter and the ship was back in service in July 1926. The Great Depression and wartime relief Sagamo passing through the locks at Port Carling circa 1935 The stock market crash of 1929 and the depression of the 1930s hit the company hard. Economic problems also accelerated the development that would prove the ultimate undoing of the Sagamo and the other steamers of the Muskoka Lakes. In order to create jobs, the government engaged in a widespread program of road construction. Not only did the new roads offer tourists the opportunity to reach their vacation destinations without engaging the steamers, it increased the competitiveness of the freight truckers and cut into the Navigation Company's freight revenues at a time it could ill afford the loss. Ironically it was the coming of war (again) which served to lift the fortunes of the steamship line and the Sagamo. Wartime rationing placed severe restrictions on the public's ability to drive and caused a resurgence of interest (and traffic) in public transportation, in a way re-creating the conditions of the early 1900s. A war-weary public looked to vacation closer to home and the Sagamo's One Hundred Mile Cruise saw good business. Management supplemented the cruise by adding a public address system in the ship which brought the live music from the lounge through the entire vessel. Postwar decline Following the war, however, the newfound prosperity brought a resurgence in automotive traffic along with disappointing traffic for the Navigation Company. At the end of the 1949 season an event occurred which would begin the final decline of steamboating in the area. On 16 September 1949 a fire broke out on the SS Noronic, then sailing the Great Lakes and docked at Toronto. Inadequate fire alarms and firefighting equipment allowed the fire to rage out of control resulting in between 118 and 139 deaths. In the aftermath, the Ministry of Transport imposed new fire control requirements on steamships. The Muskoka Lakes Lines, then owner of the Sagamo and the remaining steamships of the Muskoka Lakes Navigation and Hotel Company, already suffering from declining passenger and freight business due to new competition from the automobile and trucking lines, lacked the resources to re-fit the entire fleet. The Muskoka Lakes Lines filed bankruptcy and the ships were repossessed by the Navigation Company who chose to fit the required equipment only on the flagship Sagamo and her companion the Segwun. Sagamo received a complete sprinkler system and an alarm system costing $35,000 and weighing an additional eight tons.Tatley p 250 In 1954 the Canadian National Railway, successor to the Grand Trunk Railway closed and abandoned the station at Muskoka Wharf. That same year the company lost its mail contract as trucks could now deliver the mail faster than steamers. In September that year the company sold the steamers, including the Sagamo to Morgan Cyril Penhorwood, an accountant with no boating experience.Tatley p 260 Pendorwood took delivery in February 1955 in a newly formed company named Gravenhurst Steamships Limited, and retubed the Sagamo's boilers for what would prove to be the last time. In an effort to improve profits fares rose and maintenance was cut, and the ships soon looked shabby. The ship continued running despite more frequent breakdowns until Labor Day, 1958 when she retired. Retirement and end In 1959 the Sagamo was purchased by George Morrison and Jack Vincent along with Segwun and Cherokee who planned to turn her into a restaurant. She was freshly painted and outfitted with $12,000 of furnishings and ran as a restaurant for a time.Tatley p 267 However the location proved to be too remote from Gravenhurst, and the restaurant was not a success, closing in 1963, after which she was left unused at the wharf. She was sold again in 1968 for $5,000Tatley p 269 with plans to again operate her as a restaurant. However, during renovations a fire broke out on 12 August 1969 which burned the entire wooden portion of the vessel, leaving only the steel hull. The remains were sold and towed to West Gravenhurst where the new owner had hopes of restoring her, but in 1980 she was partially cut up and the remains left to deteriorate near the Muskoka Wharf.

Because the boundary between the Elbsandsteingebirge and the Lusatian Uplands is on Czech territory, the two natural regions are physically separated.

Formed from a charismatic prayer group in 1973, it has 2,000 permanent members in 30 countries, and 12,000 people serving in the community missions. Its main founder is the Jesuit father, . The community takes its name from the first meeting place, based in Lyon, 49 . A product of the Charismatic Renewal, the community claims to adhere to an Ignatian spirituality. It brings together priests, lay celibates (men and women) as well as non-celibates and couples with or without children. The community directs its actions around the principle of unity: unity of Christians (ecumenism), unity of men (notably between different cultures and nations), unity of couples and of families.  Historical   Context  Pentecostalism, a new branch of Christianity focusing on the welcoming of the Holy Spirit, evolved in the US after 1900 (In Topeka and then in Azusa Street Revival, Los Angeles). Its manifestations (speaking in tongues, prophecy, healings, etc.) rapidly provoked rejection from other churches (Protestant or Catholic). In 1967, some Catholic students from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, during the course of a bible study week-end, received the Baptism in the holy spirit. After this experience, prayer groups and communities began to expand in the Catholic church in the US and throughout the rest of the world.  Beginnings  In 1971, the Jesuit seminarian Laurent Fabre met Mike Cawdrey, an American Jesuit student who was familiar with the American Charismatic Renewal, at the diocesan seminary in Lyon. He convinced him, together with Bertrand Lepesant (who was later to become the founder of the ) to spend two days in prayer asking for the presence of the Holy Spirit in Le Touvet. Two young American Protestants, just back from Taizé and about to leave for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, were also invited. At the end of this weekend, the two French men received the \\"Baptism in the Holy Spirit\\". After this experience, they founded a charismatic prayer group located in Montée du Chemin-Neuf.. In 1973, Laurent Fabre, accompanied by Bertrand Lepesant, left for the United States to meet with American Charismatics. On their return, they organized a week-end attended by sixty people; seven of them celibates, four men and three women between 22 and 32 years of age, from amongst whom Laurent Fabre decided to form a lifelong community. In the beginning, they favoured a name taken from the Bible, but the members of the new foundation quickly realised that in the eyes of their visitors, due to their geographical location they were known as the \\"Chemin Neuf\\". Couples quickly joined this community which added to the mix couples and celibates. Apart from Laurent Fabre, this first community also included Jacqueline Coutellier, who had been thinking about joining the Carmelites but who has since been committed to the life of the Chemin Neuf.. By September 1978, the Chemin Neuf had 30 adult members, living in private homes or in the three community houses at that time (two in Lyon and one in Beaujolais): about twenty children lived in the community without being part of it.  Development of the community  In 1980, a cycle of theological training, biblical and community based (lasting for three months) was established in Les Pothieres, a house of the community near Anse. It continued here another thirty years and, due to its success, spread to three locations (one in France, one in Spain and one in the Ivory Coast).. Also in 1980 the first course for couples (Cana session) was launched which, in 2016, is the most popular Chemin Neuf course. At the beginning of the 1980s, the community was invited to come to the Paris area, to the Cenacle de Tigery, a few miles south of Paris, and to the student house based in the rue Madame in the 6th Arrondissement in Paris. The community also began to grow on an international level, welcoming its first non-French members (Polish, German and Madagascan) and setting up a base in Brazzaville in the Congo. In 1982, the Chemin Neuf had about forty adult members.. Cardinal Albert Decourtray, archbishop of Lyon, was particularly enthusiastic to have the community in his diocese, \\"the number of conversions impresses me\\". By that time, the Chemin Neuf had about 250 members of which 20 were life-long members; furthermore, five priests and two deacons had already been ordained and six seminarists were undergoing training. On Easter Sunday of 1986 in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean, together with Jean-Marc Villet, pastor of the French Reform Church, Mgr Decourtray received 19 lifelong members of the community, amongst them five couples and three Protestant members The archbishop assigned some missions to the Chemin Neuf, especially those relating to communication. In 1982 , priest at La Duchère, set up Radio-Fourviere with him, which soon became known as RCF. Another member of the Chemin Neuf, Vincent de Crouy- Chanel, later became director of it. , for his part, was press attache to the cardinal from 1989 to 1992. This influence of the Chemin Neuf on diocesan life was sometimes criticised but the archbishop responded that Charismatics were only available for certain missions, notably the hospital chaplaincy of Pierre Garraud. to which ten people were devoted. In 1992, the apostolic section of the Communion of the Chemin Neuf was created which brought together people wishing to live the spirituality of the community without being involved in all its commitments. From 1993 -1996 the community went through a crisis leading to the departure of certain members. This crisis coincided with the publication of the books The shipwrecks of the Spirit (), which were very critical towards a number of charismatic communities. A former supporter. of the Chemin Neuf complained about sect-like practices such as brain washing and proselytism. After the publication, it was however revealed that Thierry Baffoy, one of its authors, had made certain inaccuracies and anachronisms regarding the Chemin Neuf. Furthermore, several bishops disputed the assertions contained in the work; Mgr Balland, then Archbishop of Lyon, stated, \\"Wherever (the Community) is established it accepts the advice and guidance of the bishops and puts itself at the service of all without distinction or proselytism\\". In 1998, a very controversial article published by the Centre Against Mental Manipulation (Centre contre les manipulations mentales) mentioned, amongst other new communities, the Chemin Neuf, before however mentioning in the footnotes that \\"certain religious practices even non sectarian in themselves... are essential to the understanding of sectarian excesses which originate from the same\\". The legitimacy of these critics is, however, in question, notably by MIVILUDES which has not even mentioned the Chemin Neuf in its various annual reports since 2001.. Henri Tincq believes that these criticizes are hardly appropriate. concerning \\"The Chemin Neuf, reputed to be the wisest community, recognized by the State with the status of congregation and by the Church…\\". Since 1989, the sociologist Martine Cohen stated, with regard to the Chemin Neuf, \\"We are not only far from a strictly charismatic legitimisation of power but the distrust towards a unique 'inspiration from the Holy Spirit' has created, far beyond a usual recourse to tradition or to authorities already in place, a sort of control by the grass roots\\".  The structuring and launching of new missions  After 1995, the community became too numerous for decisions to continue to be taken by universal suffrage. The decision was taken to organise a chapter every seven years (1995, 2002, 2009, 2016) to which the seventy two members were elected by the entire community. An international choir was established in 1996 to prepare for the World Youth Days in Paris in August 1997: it notably gave concerts in 2000 on the Piazza di Spagna and on the Pope's podium at the final gathering of the World Youth Days in Rome (on the future site of the University of Rome Tor Vergata) as well as from 2001 to 2003 in Chartres Cathedral, France. In 2000, for the occasion of the World Youth Days, Net For God was established, a network of prayer and training for the unity of Christians and peace in the world, which brought together all the supporters of the Chemin Neuf and drew its inspiration from the vision of \\"the invisible monastery\\" developed in 1944 by Paul Couturier. A teaching video was transmitted every month by this network, which was growing rapidly: in 2011, the video was sent to more than one thousand \\"Net points\\", spread over 80 countries across the world and translated into twenty-six languages. In 2002, at the time of the second community assembly (known as the chapter), it was decided that all the commitments in the community or in all the different community missions would happen \\"within the ecumenical and international Net for God\\". That same year, Father Jerome Dupre La Tour, priest in the diocese of Lyon, presented to members of the council of priests, a report on the Canonical Status of the Emmanuel and Chemin Neuf communities. Its sentiments were criticised, in spite of the fact that the Status of the Chemin Neuf (public association of the faithful, which authorised a greater involvement from the bishop of the area); in his opinion, the name used by the civil authorities (congregation) did not cover the canonic definition of this term which gave way to a vagueness, notably in relation to the authority. As the canon priest, Michel Dortel-Claudot reminded us, these criticisms were found in all new communities: \\"the canon law of 1983, in its actual form, has not been adapted to new communities. To offer them the title 'Association of the faithful' is an ill-fitting coat\\", this framework had not been thought of for a group whose work took over the whole life of a person. In 2005, on the occasion of the World Youth Days in Cologne, a fraternity of young people was created with a strong link to the community: this fraternity took on the name of Youth of the Chemin Neuf. This structure made itself know in 2010, notably through the making of funny or parody style videos relating to the Christian faith or particular events. So, in 2012, a parody of \\"Gangnam Style\\" was transmitted on YouTube and received more than a million hits: \\"Catho Style\\". In 2016, a video made by the Youth of the Chemin Neuf pretended to be a response to the song \\"Sorry\\" by Justin Bieber. This media coverage was a way of responding to the criticisms of poor communication within the Catholic Church, choosing \\"to leave its walls ..., to reach young people, ... using media\\". Using social networks has given the Chemin Neuf a continual presence in the media since the 1980s. In 2014, the Chemin Neuf created a \\"Political Fraternity\\", bringing together young Christians (18 to 35 years) who were looking to get involved in politics, without party bias or sensitivity. In 2016, this fraternity numbered about fifty young adults in ten countries. During the years after 2000, the requests of the bishops or communities led the Chemin Neuf Community to establish itself, on average, in one new country each year. In 2016, members in missions in France numbered no more than about 40% of all members: the countries where the growth in members has been highest is Central Europe, Brazil and Africa..  Missions   All year round missions entrusted by local churches  A particular request of the bishops was for the Chemin Neuf to lead parishes. The first to do this was Mgr Etchegaray, at that time , who entrusted the parish of Saint-Roch de Mazargues to the community from 1978 onwards. In 2017, there are 18 catholic parishes which have been entrusted in this way to Chemin Neuf teams.. Besides the \\"classic\\" services within the parish, the community was also the first place in France to try out the Alpha course.. Several student halls of residence were entrusted to the Chemin Neuf by parishes, dioceses, ecclesiastical organisations, or they were established by the community (particularly in Africa in the case of the latter)... Bishops from several symbolic places of the Christian faith also asked the community, without entrusting them with the responsibility of the buildings, to sing the daily liturgical offices, especially vespers, like in the Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Chartres,. in the cathedral of Saint-Jean of Lyon. or in the in Jerusalem..  The exercises of Saint Ignatius  The Chemin Neuf Community, being of Ignatian tradition, offers sessions that are in the majority inspired by the spiritual exercises, as they are given by Jesuits, adapted by integrating aspects belonging to the spirituality of the Charismatic Renewal. Every year, in France alone, the community organises about thirty retreats in the spiritual exercises lasting one week, as well as two retreats of one month, the latter is advised to be undertaken before any decision of definitive commitment. Often diocesan seminarists come to follow the latter together before their ordination as deacons.  Retreat activities and sessions adapted to particular situations  Children during a Cana session at Sablonceaux Abbey.  Cana Sessions  A first experience of sessions organised for couples took place in 1979 at the request of a couple from the Teams of Our Lady. Acknowledging very high demand, the Chemin Neuf Community launched its Cana mission in 1980 (the name of which is inspired from the place of the first of Jesus’ miracles during the marriage feast at Cana). It is a mission that involves couples and families (including children and with specific leisure time and community life organised for the latter). Even more than the other Chemin Neuf missions, this one comes under the banner of unity and reconciliation. From 1980 to 2007, nearly 20,000 couples participated in Cana sessions. For Paul Destable, assistant secretary general at the Bishops' Conference of France, the Cana mission is an example which shows \\"the dynamism of the lay communities\\". Recognising the numerous needs relating to conjugal matters, the Cana mission expanded. As well as the initial sessions aimed at couples, other sessions were added: \\"Cana Couples and families\\" with a notable emphasis on the evangelisation of children and their participation in family life; \\"Cana Engagement\\" for couples beginning their journey, preparation for marriage, engagement: \\"Cana Hope\\" for people who are divorced or separated and not involved in a new relationship; finally \\"Cana Samaria\\" for divorced and re- married people. These last sessions are often centred on the official position of the church (particularly the Catholic church) with regard to the sacraments, and bishops are often in attendance. The Cana mission also has at its disposal the tool \\"Elle et Lui\\" developed during the Alpha course, specifically for couples. It is offered in parishes as well as in other suitable places. In the geographic region of the two islands of Réunion and Mauritius, Valerie Perretant-Aubourg notes that the Cana Sessions are a particularly important social melting pot, bringing together doctors or teachers or illiterate building workers.  Mission with young people  Volkenroda in 2005, organised by the Chemin Neuf on the occasion of the World Youth Day in Cologne. Overview of the gathering at Volkenroda in 2005. At the beginning of the 1980s an active mission for young people aged between 18 and 30 was set up and was reinforced in 1985 with the launching of World Youth Days by Pope John Paul II. This mission has grown steadily, notably with the launch of student halls of residence in major French towns and elsewhere. From 1986, a festival, gathering several hundred young people was organised at Sablonceaux Abbey (south west France). Participating in this were certain artists embarking on a \\"Creation Fraternity\\", performing live shows to the participants but also to local inhabitants and to tourists.. Having arrived at Hautecombe Abbey (Savoie, France), the Chemin Neuf saw the potential of this site to organise more ambitious gatherings. The first European gathering, in 1993, saw the enrolment of a thousand participants, a number which increased to two thousand in 1996 (from thirty nationalities with a predominance of Eastern Europeans). During these gatherings the day is split into two parts, with a morning dedicated to teachings and testimonies and an afternoon open for workshops and forums. A particularly strong emphasis is placed on unity and reconciliation. These gatherings in Savoie were moved to other places for specific events. This was particularly the case in the World Youth Day years. The young people, generally in large numbers (about five thousand) were also accommodated in Perugia (Umbria, Italy) in 2000, in Volkenroda, Thüringen, Germany, in 2005,. in Guadarrama (Madrid, Spain) in 2011,. in Łódź (Poland) in 2016. . On other occasions (Jubilee of the Ignatian Family in Lourdes in 2006.) these gatherings can be moved to a specific place. Since the summer of 2012, the summer gathering at Hautecombe changed its name to: Welcome to Paradise.. The mission for teenagers aged 14 to 18 years was also launched in the 1980s. In its infancy, it was centred on evangelisation only. Since then it has opened out to humanitarianism (participation in summer missions from six to eight weeks generally in Africa). It is present in France and in the majority of the places where there are community missions. The mission for 8 to 13 year olds is much more recent (it began between 2007 to 2010). It was developed in Brazil by the Catholic Church, worried by the defection of many of the faithful. For the moment it is limited to a few weekends per year in France and Brazil, particularly in parishes wanting to make the catechism groups more dynamic.  Status  The community is composed of lay and religious persons from many Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican, Reformed, Orthodox. In 1984, it was recognised by Cardinal Alexandre Renard and declared a public association of the faithful by Cardinal Albert Decourtray, Archbishop of Lyon. This canonical status allowed it to teach Christian doctrine on behalf of the Catholic Church and to promote public worship. From a civil point of view, the community was recognised as a religious congregation by a decree from the Prime Minister of France on 23 July 1993. In France, the community has several branches located in Lyon, Anse (Rhône department), Soleymieu (Isère), Hautecombe (Savoie), Le Plantay (Abbey Notre-Dame-des-Dombes, Ain), Sablonceaux (Charente-Maritime), Tigery (Essonne), Chartres (Eure-et-Loir), Bouvines (Nord), Marseille (Bouches-du- Rhône), Levallois (Hauts-de-Seine), Paris, Villeurbanne (Rhône), Lucé- Mainvilliers (Eure-et-Loir), Lille (Nord), Reims (Marne), Sophia-Antipolis (Alpes-Maritimes), Angers (Maine-et-Loire). The community is also present in Belgium, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chad, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Madagascar, Martinique, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Poland, Réunion, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In 2014, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, invited young adults from around the world to join the Community of St Anselm, a Jesus-centered community of prayer facilitated by the Chemin Neuf for one year. Ruth Gledhill of Christian Today wrote that \\"The year-long programme will include prayer, study, practical service and community life. Members will live a spiritual discipline compared to that of medieval monks, drawing closer to God through a daily rhythm of silence, study and prayer. At the same time they will also be immersed in the modern challenges of the global 21st century church, witnessing to the power of a pared-back disciplined faith in managing the demanding business of contemporary high-tech life.\\".

The area is specifically notorious for having the state-owned mansions compound designed for the state high-ranking officials. The facility includes four football grounds including one with artificial turf. There is also an administration area where there exists an enclosed training hall, medical facilities and a concert hall. One of the grounds has seating facilities where most official games are played at. The original capacity of the ground was about 750, which has now been updated to hold 1200.  History  The Educational-Training base of Dynamo Kyiv was opened in 1961 after the club won the Soviet Championship. In 1996 reconstruction began at the complex and it was reopened in March 1998. The project was managed by the well known architect Vitaliy Oksiukovsky. The facility is considered now one of the most modern in Europe and of the highest UEFA standards. Cтан підготовки м.

The scandal involved a Chicago player, Art Folz, hiring a group of high school football players to play for the Milwaukee Badgers, against the Cardinals. This would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was used to help prop up their win-loss percentage and as a chance of wresting the 1925 Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. The scandal In 1925, the Chicago Cardinals were in the running to win the NFL championship with the Pottsville Maroons. The Maroons had beaten the Cardinals 21-7 earlier in the season at Comiskey Park. This loss gave Pottsville a half game lead in the standings. However, the Cardinals felt that they could make up for the loss. Many professional football teams during the first decade of the NFL would schedule some easy extra games to pad their record and place in the standing. The Cardinals had hoped that the move would help bump the team to a first-place finish over Pottsville. Prior to 1933, the team with the best record in the standings at the end of the season was named the season's NFL Champions. The two extra games were scheduled against the inferior Milwaukee Badgers and Hammond Pros, both of which were NFL members but had disbanded for the year. The Badgers, owned by Ambrose McGuirk, agreed to a game against the Cardinals. However, McGuirk lived in Chicago, which put him at a disadvantage in getting his team back together to play the Cardinals. Art Folz, a substitute quarterback for the Cardinals, convinced four players from Englewood High School, located in Chicago, into joining the Badgers for the game under assumed names, thereby ensuring that the Cardinals' opponent was not a pro caliber club. Folz himself was an Englewood High School graduate. Meanwhile, the Cardinals' owner, Chris O'Brien, unaware of the roster tampering, but still sensing a mismatch, did not charge attendance to the few scattered spectators who turned up for the December 10, 1925, game. However, the second game on December 12, against Hammond proved to be much closer in score with 13-0 Cardinals win over the Pros. Box score Outcome Initial A few weeks later, when NFL President Joseph Carr learned high school players had been used, he told reporters the 58-0 Cardinals win would be stricken from the record. However, the league had never got around to removing it. The game is still a part of the NFL records. Chris O'Brien was also fined $1,000 by Carr for allowing his team play a game against high schoolers, even though he claimed that he was unaware of the players' status. Ambrose McGuirk was ordered to sell his Milwaukee franchise within 90 days. Folz, for his role, was barred from football for life. 1926 By the summer of 1926, Carr toned down his punishment for each party involved in the scandal. Folz's lifetime ban was lifted, probably to prevent him from joining the first American Football League; however he chose not to return to pro football. The $1,000 fine against O'Brien was rescinded, probably since the amount would have put the Cardinals out of business. McGuirk though had already sold his Badgers franchise to Johnny Bryan, a fullback with the Chicago Bears. The Englewood players were also forgiven, and two of them, William Thompson and Charles Richardson, earned high school all- star recognition at the end of the season. Folz reportedly told the high schoolers that the game was a \\"practice game\\" and would in no part affect their amateur status. Role in the 1925 NFL championship dispute In early December 1925, the Maroons, with a 9-2 record, were just a half-game behind the Cardinals, who were 9-1-1. At the same time as the Hammond-Chicago game, the Maroons scheduled a game against a team of Notre Dame all-stars that included the famed Four Horsemen. Due to the public interest of the game, it was played in a larger venue, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, not Pottsville's Minersville Park, which was mainly a high school stadium. By playing in Philadelphia, the Maroons were violating territory agreements drawn up by the NFL. Philadelphia was within the boundaries already claimed as the home by the Frankford Yellow Jackets. The Yellow Jackets, after hearing of the planned Notre Dame contest, filed a protest with the NFL. Pottsville's owner said all along that the game was sanctioned by the NFL and that he had received permission to play in Philadelphia from an NFL secretary. However, Carr had the final say and on several occasions, he threatened the Pottsville team with suspension from the league if the game took place. Pottsville played the game anyway and won, 9-7, on a last-minute field goal. The Maroons were fined, tossed from the league, and stripped of their title. They would also have to cancel the remaining game on their schedule, against the Providence Steam Roller. The team also was ruled ineligible for the league title, which was eventually awarded to the Cardinals. However, the Pottsville fans still demand to know why Cardinals was awarded the title even though they too were found by Carr to have violated the NFL's rules. According to Bob Carroll of the Professional Football Researchers Association, \\"The Cardinals didn't defy the league,\\" Carroll said. \\"Pottsville did. It was a great team, but the owner made a mistake.\\" However, it is still not entirely known if O'Brien knew of the high school players on the Badgers team. The Pottsville team was reinstated by the NFL in July 1926, mainly because the NFL did not want to lose Pottsville's skilled group of players to the upstart American Football League. Even though the Cardinals were awarded the 1925 Championship, O'Brien refused to accept it, stating that he did not want to win the title \\"that way\\". However, in 1933, as Charles Bidwell took over as the owner of the Cardinals, he began to claim the 1925 title belonged to the Cardinals, overturning O'Brien earlier decision. It is also believed that a Cardinals Football Curse was put upon the Cardinals and Bidwell because of the events surrounding the 1925 Championship. The Cardinals did however, win the NFL Championship in 1947.

Pyle. Ellen Bernard Thompson Pyle (November 11, 1876 – August 1, 1936) was an American illustrator best known for the 40 covers she created for The Saturday Evening Post in the 1920s and 1930s under the guidance of Post editor-in-chief, George Horace Lorimer. She studied with Howard Pyle and later married Pyle’s brother Walter. Life Born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia on November 11, 1876 to Newcomb Butler and Kate Ashton Thompson, Ellen began her artistic studies at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry in 1895. In 1897, she began to study under the famous illustrator Howard Pyle, and in 1898 and 1899, she was one of his top students. She was given commissions for illustrations for periodicals and books, and she was invited to attend Howard Pyle's Brandywine School in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania both years. Around this time, she met Howard's youngest brother, Walter. In 1900 or 1901, Ellen's study with Howard Pyle ended, but she continued to work from her parents' home, and she had a number of book and magazine illustrations published. In 1904, she and Walter married, and she moved to Wilmington, Delaware. Walter and Ellen had four children between 1906 and 1914 and she suspended her art career to raise her family. in 1928 she wrote, “The absorbing task of raising four children put artwork in the background for a time. There has been a great deal of discussion as to whether a woman can keep on with her work and be a competent mother.”Quoted in In 1919, Walter died of Bright's Disease, and Ellen, then aged 42, returned to illustration art to support her family. She created magazine covers and book dust jacket art throughout the 1920s and 1930s, gaining in popularity each year. Two of her children attended art school and became successful artists. “I criticized their work, and they often pose for me, and at times it seems as if everyone in the house was either painting or being painted.” Pyle died on August 1, 1936 of heart disease, a few months short of her 60th birthday. Ellen Pyle's youngest daughter, Caroline, married Nathaniel C. Wyeth, elder son of N. C. Wyeth. Musician Howard Wyeth was one of her many grandchildren. Cover of the Saturday Evening Post, January 21, 1922, entitled Woman with Headband by Ellen B.T. Pyle. Art Pyle's covers for the Saturday Evening Post in the 1920s and 1930s often featured flappers, athletic young women, and rosy-cheeked children, sometimes with their grandmothers. Her own children modelled for 20 of these covers. Friends and neighbors also commonly served as models. She wrote “The girl I am most interested in painting is the unaffected natural American type, the girl that likes to coast and skate in winter, who often goes without her hat, and who gets a thrill out of tramping over country roads in the fall.” Some of her most memorable covers were: *Flapper - February 4, 1922. *Girl Hockey Player - January 22, 1927. *Sea in the Shell - August 6, 1927 - a toddler listens to a seashell. *Target Practice - October 8, 1927 - a young woman practices archery. *Radio Days - February 22, 1930 - a grandmother and child listen to an early radio. *Waiting for the Bus - December 13, 1930 - a grandmother and grandson wait for a bus. *Woman Tennis Player - August 30, 1932. *Flower Children - May 5, 1934 - two children sell flowers in the rain for “5 cents a Bunsh”. An original Saturday Evening Post cover by Ellen Pyle was appraised at $25,000-35,000 in 2006 on the Antiques RoadshowAntiques Roadshow, appraiser Alan Fausel Her first career retrospective, organized by one of her great-grandchildren, was displayed at the Delaware Art Museum in 2009.

WSDMA is a beamforming technique suitable for overlay on the latest air-interface protocols including WCDMA and OFDM. WSDMA enabled systems can determine the angle of arrival (AoA) of received signals to spatially divide a cell sector into many sub-sectors. This spatial awareness provides information necessary to maximise Carrier to Noise+Interference Ratio (CNIR) link budget, through a range of digital processing routines. WSDMA facilitates a flexible approach to how uplink and downlink beamforming is performed and is capable of spatial filtering known interference generating locations. Key features * Transmit and receive beam shaping and steering * Multiple sub-sector path processing * Spatial interference filtering * Sector activity scan  Characteristics and principles of operation   Active Panel Antenna Calibration  Active Panel Antenna systems, comprising a planar array of micro-radios and associated antenna element, rely upon a comprehensive calibration scheme which is able to correct inter-path signal mismatches in phase, amplitude and latency. This facilitates precise control of the uplink and downlink RF beam pattern and avoids distortion effects that occur in the absence of calibration.  Multiple Sub-Sector path processing  By dividing the cell sector into a number of sub-sector beams, WSDMA provides the network with spatially filtered signals, maximising link budget through improved antenna gain and interference mitigation. This allows for mobile users in the cell to reduce their uplink power transmission, thereby further reducing interference and minimising both base station and UE power consumption. WSDMA provides simultaneous sector-wide and sub-sector beam processing to improve link performance in multipath environments. Sub-sector beam processing can optimise changing user demographics within the cell sector.  Downlink WSDMA  Downlink WSDMA provides an optimised RF beam pattern, reducing interference in overlap regions of adjacent cell sectors. Long term statistical based adjustment can optimise cell patterns depending on the user population density per spatial region serviced by the cell.

This includes a stylized description of the escutcheon (shield), the crest, and, if present, supporters, mottoes, and other insignia. Certain rules apply, such as the rule of tincture, and a thorough understanding of these rules is a key to the art of heraldry. This system was adapted to Mexican society by incorporating flora and fauna native to Mexico. Another conspicuous difference between Mexican heraldry and European heraldry is the absence of a helm surmounting the shield. Most traditions of Mexican heraldry came from Hispanic or Spanish origin from regions in Spain or Portugal, predominating heraldry of Castilian, Basque or Galician, in second place heraldry of Catalan and Valencian origin. Other common heraldic traditions in Mexico came from French, Italian, German and Polish origins. The most recent heraldic influences, since 1943, are of English origin. Spanish origins The descent of Spanish arms and titles differs from much of Europe in that they can be inherited through females. Also, illegitimacy did not prevent the descent of arms and titles. The great Spanish families believed that a family pedigree could be more damaged by misalliance than by illegitimacy. Indeed, the patents of nobility of many Spanish families contained bequeathals to illegitimate branches in case no legitimate heirs were found. Illegitimacy in Spain was divided into three categories. # Natural children; Those born of single or widowed parents who could be legitimized by the marriage of their parents or by a declaration by their father that they were his heirs. # Spurious children; Those whose parents were not in a position to marry. These children had to be legitimized by a petition of royal ratification. # Incestuous children; Those born of parents too closely related to marry or who were under a religious vow. These hijos required a papal dispensation in order to inherit their parent's arms or property. These papal dispensations were granted so often that every diocese in Spain had signed blanks ready to affix the appropriate name.

He was the country's Finance Minister from January 2009 till December 2018. Early life and education Born in Sylhet, Muhith passed the matriculation exam from Sylhet Government Pilot High School in 1949. He secured first place in his Intermediate examination in 1951 from Sylhet MC College. He stood first class first in B.A. (Hons.) in English Literature in 1953 from University of Dhaka and passed his Masters with credit from the same university in 1955. While in service to the government, he studied at the University of Oxford in 1957–1958. He completed a Master of Public Administration at Harvard University in 1964. Early career Muhith served as the general secretary of the central committee of the Pakistan Civil Service Association during 1960–1969. He joined the Pakistan Embassy in the United States as an Economic Counselor in 1969. In 1966, he was honoured with the Tamgha e Khidmat award by the Pakistan government. During his service as the Chief and Deputy Secretary of Pakistan Planning Commission, he made a report on the discrimination between East and West Pakistan and that was the first submitted report on that issue in Pakistan National Congress. He was the first diplomat of Washington Embassy who showed his consent in favour of Bangladesh giving up the side of Pakistan during the Independence War of 1971. He was appointed as the Secretary of Planning in 1972 and Secretary of the External Resource Department of Finance and Planning Ministry in 1977. Retirement and return Muhith went for self-retirement in 1981 from his service and then he started his second innings of his career as the specialist of economics and development in Ford Foundation and in the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He became Finance and Planning Minister in 1982–83. Next, he worked as the specialist of different institutions of World Bank and the United Nations. He has been a recognised figure in the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, IDB and in different organisations of United Nations. He was the Visiting Fellow of Princeton University in 1984 and 1985. Muhith took oath as the Finance Minister of Bangladesh government on 6 January 2009 and in August 2009 he inaugurated the building of the Benapole Customs and Immigration Check Post.

He admitted to his mistakes in decisions related to the stock market in addition to the mistakes of the Security and Exchange Commission. Although the opposition leaders and protesting investors had called for his resignation, he refused and defended his position. He had appointed a probe committee to investigate the allegations against the Security Exchange Commission, however this also attracted criticism towards him as he consequently refused to publicly disclose the names of those accused of chicanery by this committee. Muhith became the center of a criticism after he had commented on the Hallmark money scam that the Tk 4,000 crore embezzled was a \\"meager amount\\". He later apologized for his statement. Muhith had been criticised for consistently insulting Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and terming his comments as \\"totally rubbish\\" and also for saying Yunus has no integrity over the Grameen Bank issue. In September 2015, Muhith faced widespread criticisms for his remarks against the movement of public university teachers of Bangladesh seeking for a separate pay scale. He later apologized for his remarks. At the same time, controversy was caused by VAT being imposed on the Bangladeshi private university education system: Muhith defended this decision.

He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Illinois. Asamoah was considered one of the top interior offensive linemen for the 2010 NFL Draft. Asamoah has also played for the Atlanta Falcons. High school career Asamoah attended Rich East High School in Park Forest, Illinois, where he was a two-time first-team SICA Green All-Conference selection and helped the offense to gain over 3,100 rushing yards. He was an All-State selection by the Chicago Sun-Times, and an All-Midwest Region selection by PrepStar. Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Asamoah was not ranked among the nation's best offensive linemen prospects in 2005. He originally committed to Northern Illinois, but reconsidered his choice after he received an offer by Illinois. College career In his initial year at Illinois, Asamoah played in five of the last six games of the season at offensive guard as a true freshman. In 2007, he started at right guard in all 13 games and was in on 991 offensive plays. He recorded 80 knockdowns, blocking for 2007 Big Ten Player of the Year Rashard Mendenhall, who later was a first-round selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. In his junior season, Asamoah was part of an offensive line that has helped the Illini rank first in the Big Ten in total offense (448.3) and pass offense (274.5) and second in scoring offense (30.4) through 11 games. In 2009, Asamoah was listed at No. 5 on Rivals.com′s preseason interior lineman power ranking. He was also named to the 2009 Outland Trophy watch list. Professional career 2010 NFL Draft Sports Illustrated noted he \\"lacks great bulk but is a solid run blocker.\\" Asamoah was selected in the third round, 68th overall, by the Kansas City Chiefs. He was the highest selected Illinois offensive lineman since Brad Hopkins in 1993. Kansas City Chiefs Asamoah started one game in the 2010 NFL season. It was a game against the Buffalo Bills. The next season, Asamoah started all games of the season. In 2013, he was expected to compete with Geoff Schwartz for playing time at guard. He ended up starting nine games.

By controlling this timing, the amount of power delivered to the wheels is regulated, as is the direction that the wheels rotate, giving the lever the alternate name of the reversing lever. This is the term employed in British English, while the term 'Johnson Bar' is the norm in the United States. History Historians have not identified the reasons why engineers called the reversing lever a Johnson Bar, but the reversing lever is described in both British, and American railway journals of the time. The best accreditation of the invention is documented under the Walschaerts valve gear. Reversing The reversing lever in locomotive history is documented from about 1842. The American Railway Master Mechanic's Association had members that published illustrations. Parts for the reversing lever are drawn in the \\"Locomotive Dictionary\\", 1st edition (1906), by George Little Fowler. The lever is linked to the valve gear piston inside the high pressure steam port. The steam pressure faucet is closed to cut off power, and after coming to a halt, the valve gear piston could safely be moved a short distance using the lever as a fulcrum linked to the piston inside. Although the linkage was designed to give leverage, the Johnson Bar would take a firm throw to move and lock in position. Some locomotives had a screw reversing gear instead. Steam cut-off The other use of the lever is to set the point of steam cut-off. This is measured as the percentage of the piston stroke during which live boiler steam is still being admitted to the cylinder. For starting the locomotive (when maximum torque is required), \\"full\\" cut-off may be as high as 85%, meaning that the piston is subject to almost full boiler pressure throughout most of its stroke. Conversely, when running at high speed and not accelerating or climbing a gradient, cut-off can be set to as low as 10%. This reduces torque but greatly economises on fuel, since far less steam is supplied to the cylinder and it is more efficiently used, being more greatly expanded and thus exhausted at a much lower temperature than when working at full cut-off. For steady-state running of most locomotives it is most efficient in terms of fuel and water to run with the throttle wide open and a short cut-off. Limitations The reversing lever has a catch mechanism which engages with a series of notches to hold the lever at the desired cut-off position. This means that the operator does not have a full choice of cut-off positions between maximum and mid-gear, but only those which correspond with the notches. The position of the notches is chosen by the locomotive designer or constructor with a view to the locomotive's intended purpose - in general engines designed for freight will have fewer notches with a 'longer' minimum cut-off (providing high tractive effort at low speeds but poor efficiency at high speeds) while a passenger locomotive will have more notches and a shorter minimum cut-off (allowing efficiency at high speeds at the expense of tractive effort). If the minimum cut-off provided for by the notches was too high it would not be possible to run the locomotive in the efficient way described above (with a fully open regulator) without leading to steam wastage or 'choking' of the steam passages, so the regulator would have to be closed, limiting efficiency. The Johnson Bar is effectively part of the entire valve gear, being connected to the various linkages and arms in order to serve its function in adjusting them. This means that the forces in the valve gear can be transmitted to the lever. This is especially the case if the engine has unbalanced slide valves, which have a high operating friction and are subject to steam forces on both sides of the valve. This friction meant that if the Johnson Bar is unlatched while the engine is operating under high steam pressure (wide regulator openings and high cut-off) or at high speeds, the forces that are supposed to act on the slide valves can instead be transmitted back through the linkage to the now-free reversing lever. This will suddenly and violently throw the lever into the full cut-off position, carrying with it the real danger of injury to the driver, damage to the valve gear and triggering wheelslip in the locomotive. The only way to prevent this is to close the regulator and allow the steam pressure in the valve chest to drop. The reversing lever can then be unlatched and set to a new cut-off position and then the regulator could be opened again. During this process the locomotive is not be under power. On ascending gradients it was a matter of great skill to reduce the regulator opening by enough to safely unlatch the Johnson Bar while maintaining sufficient steam pressure to the cylinders. Each time the regulator was re-opened was a chance to encounter wheelslip and in loose coupled trains each closure and opening of the regulator set up dynamic forces throughout the length of the train which risked broken couplings. The screw reverser overcame all these issues. It provides infinite selection of cut-off between the valve gear's maximum and mid-gear and because it works by adjusting a heavy-duty screw thread, is never 'unlatched' even when the cut- off is being altered and thus transmitted no force to the control handle in normal use (in conditions of priming or wheelspin excessive force can generate enough force to rotate the wheel). The cut-off can be altered while the cylinders are receiving full steam pressure, allowing the regulator to be wide open as often as possible. The power reverser is a further refinement of the idea, being a servomechanism which remotely operates the valve gear by steam or compressed air, with no physical connection between the driver's reversing handle and the valve gear, and thus being free from any in-gear forces. The dangers of the traditional Johnson Bar (which grew as locomotive power, weight and operating steam pressures increased through the first half of the 20th century) led to it being banned in the USA by the Interstate Commerce Commission. From 1939 all new-build steam locomotives had to be fitted with power reversers and from 1942 Johnson Bar-fitted engines undergoing heavy overhaul or rebuilding had to be retro-fitted with power reverse. Exceptions existed for light, low-powered locomotives and switchers. For switching, which required frequent changes of direction from full-ahead to full-reverse gear, the Johnson Bar was favoured because the change could be made quickly in a single motion instead of the multiple turns of the handle of a low-geared screw reverser.

It adjoins the Territory's border with Western Australia and is operated as a cattle station by the Consolidated Pastoral Company (CPC). Description The station contains black soil, forest and stony ridge country. It carries 15,000 head of cattle, turning off 4,000 head of weaner steers and spayed heifers annually. The cattle are trucked to Argyle Downs, operated by the same company, eventually entering the live export trade to Southeast Asian markets.CPC Properties: Newry. The property bounded to the east by Auvergne Station. History Named after the Irish port of Newry, the property was first taken up in 1886, with a homestead built on the banks of the Keep River. Cattle were introduced after the lease was bought by pastoralist Patrick Durack who spent two years droving a herd of 7,000 cattle and horses 5,000 km across northern Australia to the Ord River region where they established several cattle stations. By 1901 the station, along with Argyle and Auvergne, was carrying about 45,000 head of cattle. The property remained with the Durack family until 1950 when it was sold to the Australian Agricultural Company. AAC introduced Santa Gertrudis cattle, before achieving better results through crossing Brahmans with Kimberley Shorthorns. In 1986 it was bought by the Baines River Cattle Company. It was eventually purchased, along with other properties, by CPC in 1992. A deposit of rare zebra rock was found on the station in 2011, which was mined by the Kimberley Stone company. Employing a workforce of two, the company used low impact mining to extract the stone for local markets. In June 2017, the company announced it would be closing operations in order to protect the site for future generations. Conservation Much of the pastoral lease lies within the Keep River Important Bird Area, so classified because of the importance of its habitats for conservation of the endangered Gouldian finch.

Mashed data produced by enterprise mashups are presented in graphical user interfaces as mashlets, widgets, or gadgets. EMML can also be considered a declarative mashup domain-specific language (DSL). A mashup DSL eliminates the need for complex, time-consuming, and repeatable procedural programming logic to create enterprise mashups. EMML also provides a declarative language for creating visual tools for enterprise mashups. The primary benefits of EMML are mashup design portability and interoperability of mashup solutions. These benefits are expected to accelerate the adoption of enterprise mashups by creating transferable skills for software developers and reducing vendor lock-in. The introduction of EMML is expected to help accelerate the trend toward the integration of Web-based applications and service-oriented architecture (SOA) technologies. Bank of America was a high-profile early supporter of EMML. Other prominent early supporters included Hewlett-Packard, Capgemini, Adobe Systems, and Intel. EMML history Raj Krishnamurthy (chief architect at JackBe Corporation) and Deepak Alur (VP engineering at JackBe Corporation) started working on EMML in 2006. Their objective was to enable user-oriented and user-enabled mashups by creating what was then a new type of middleware called an Enterprise Mashup Platform. Raj Krishnamurthy became the chief language designer and implementer of EMML and also led the team to create an Eclipse-based EMML IDE called Mashup Studio. This work evolved into the EMML reference implementation that was donated to the Open Mashup Alliance. Raj Krishnamurthy continues to be one of the key contributors to EMML through the Open Mashup Alliance. EMML features EMML language provides a rich set of high-level mashup-domain vocabulary to consume and mash a variety of Web data-sources in flexible ways. EMML provides a uniform syntax to invoke heterogeneous service styles: REST, WSDL, RSS/ATOM, RDBMS, and POJO. The EMML language also provides ability to mix diverse data formats: XML, JSON, JDBC, JavaObjects, and primitive types. High-level EMML language features include: * Filter and sort data coming from heterogeneous services * Join data across heterogeneous services and data formats * Group and aggregate data using assorted functions * Annotate original service data to enrich its semantic meaning * Merge multiple data streams into consolidated datasets * Split datasets to select individual data fields * Embedded scripting support for JavaScript, JRuby, Groovy, XQuery * Web clipping to scrape data from HTML pages * Conditional statements - \`If\`/\`Then\`/\`Else\`, \`While\`, \`ForEach\` * Parallel syntax for concurrent processing EMML is primarily a XML-based declarative language, but also provides ability to encode complex logic using embedded scripting engines. XPath is the expression language used in EMML.  Directinvoke statement \`directinvoke\` provides ability to invoke and consume a variety of data services.

Procedure Normal mammalian somatic cells are diploid: each chromosome (and thus every gene) is present in duplicate (excluding genes from X chromosome absent in Y chromosome). The assay starts with producing a tetraploid cell in which every chromosome exists fourfold. This is done by taking an embryo at the two-cell stage and fusing the two cells by applying an electrical current. The resulting tetraploid cell will continue to divide, and all daughter cells will also be tetraploid. Such a tetraploid embryo can develop normally to the blastocyst stage and will implant in the wall of the uterus. The tetraploid cells can form the extra- embryonic tissue (placenta, etc.); however, a proper fetus will rarely develop. In the tetraploid complementation assay, one now combines such a tetraploid embryo (either at the morula or blastocyst stage) with normal diploid embryonic stem cells (ES) from a different organism. The embryo will then develop normally; the fetus is exclusively derived from the ES cell, while the extra-embryonic tissues are exclusively derived from the tetraploid cells. Applications * Foreign genes or mutations can be introduced into ES cells rather easily, and these ES cells can then be grown into whole animals using the tetraploid complementation assay. * By introducing targeted mutations into the tetraploid cells and/or into the ES cells, one can study which genes are important for fetal development and which ones are important for development of the extra-embryonic tissues. * The tetraploid complementation assay is also used to test whether induced pluripotent stem cells (stem cells artificially produced from differentiated cells, e.g. from skin cells) are as competent as normal embryonal stem cells. If a viable animal can be produced from an induced pluripotent stem cell using the tetraploid complementation assay, then the induced stem cells are deemed equivalent to embryonal stem cells. This was first shown in 2009.Lan Kang, Jianle Wang, Yu Zhang, Zhaohui Kou, Shaorong Gao. 2009. iPS cells can support full-term development of tetraploid blastocyst-complemented embryos.

This style (aka Colchian and Iberian) was revived by the swimmer Henry Kuprashvili by swimming 2 kilometers using military-training style of swimming “Hands and Feet bound Colchian” on January 28, 2001. In 2002, for the first time in history, he swam across the Dardanelles Strait in 3 hours and 15 minutes using \\"Hands and Feet bound Colchian\\" on August 30. Henry Kuprashvili laid foundation of Georgian styles of swimming study process and established the school of swimming. Levan Kursua 1887-1969 depicted in Ergeta Henry Kuprashvili - 2002. Born. 1946 The Georgian style of swimming comprises several styles unique to Georgia: “Lazuri” (Free Colchian), “Hands and feet bound Colchian” (Military Colchian), “Apkhazuri” (Abkhazian), “Okribula”, “Iberiuli” (Iberian), “Takhvia” and partly “Khashuruli” and “Kizikuri”. More traditional movements of the extremities are restricted or barred and forward motion is accomplished by dolphin-like undulation of hips and paired feet. These styles emulate the motions of mammals such as the seal, dolphin, sea lion, whale, and beaver, which have evolved adaptations to water that enable them to attain an optimal swimming ability. For those familiar with competitive swimming styles, Free Colchian most closely resembles the butterfly stroke, but with the arms remaining at the swimmer's sides.  Technique  While swimming Lazuri (Free Colchian) or sport style: * The legs are pressed tightly together, the arms are pressed closely along the bodyline, the elbows should not jut out (to avoid excess resistance). The palms are touching the thighs; * The pelvis-waist takes a particularly active part, the legs are also active supporters, especially from the viewpoint of balance, the arms do not take any part at all; * Swimming starts with a simultaneous energetic lifting of the waist upward and movement of tightly placed legs downwards, during which the shoulder and the head move forward horizontally. At the same time feet get out of the extremely low position (they are not deep in water: not more than 10-12 degrees), the faster they leave the low position the weaker are the brake factors; * The second phase starts instantly afterwards, during which the swimmer already in the initial position. Energetic blow is maximally powerful, forward sliding in water active and quick, which becomes more effective with energetic simultaneous movements, twice (or more times) of joined feet; * Breathing in is made possible at the third movement of the pelvis and the feet, during which the shoulder zone usually moves straight, and the head is slightly raised above water with face and sight forward so that the mouth is slightly above the surface of the water to breathe in (it is possible to move the head right or left). The swimmer should follow the stream, without making any rough movements in order not to “disturb” water and cause unnecessary excessive hydrodynamic resistance. The swimmer should be in such control of this process, as well as water, to avoid occurrence of excessive hindering waves. (it’s possible to breathe in-out in 3 or more cycles, while breathing the swimmer may turn his head to right or left, at the swimmer’s convenience); * To start a new cycle of the pelvis and feet movement the head returns to the initial position (breathing in and out can be made for 2-3 phases); * During this phase the legs, movement forward is weaker than during the previous two and to overcome the rising waves resistance the feet glide on the water surface more, trying to keep the balance of the body in the upright position.  Start  In Lazuri (Free Colchian) swimming starts like Free style (crawl), breaststroke and butterfly. But at initial condition, while start and going into the water hands are moved up straight to the body File:Free Colchian start 1.jpg File:Free Colchian start 2.jpg  Turning movement  Turning movement while swimming Lazuri (Free Colchian) is similar to that of the front crawl.

Plot  Three couples are followed as they struggle to have children. Diana and Andy Douglas are a newlywed couple with great careers trying to have a baby for eleven months, without any results. As they visit the doctor, they are crushed to find out that Diana has problems with her ovary and she has a 1 in 10,000 chance to become pregnant. Diana, who always wanted to have a child, considers finding a surrogate mother, but the process proves to be very painful because Andy always wanted to have a child as well. She thinks she is preventing him from living his dream and files for divorce. Eventually, Andy convinces Diana that he only wants to be with her and together, they decide to adopt a child. They find Jane, a student who thinks a baby will destroy her promising future. After giving birth to a girl, Hilary, Diana is filled with joy to finally become a mother. Jane, however, changes her mind and claims her baby back. Meanwhile, Diana turns out to be pregnant after all. In the end, she ends up with two children, following Jane's decision not to have the child after all. Another plot involves Charlie Winwood, an orphan who, like Diana, always wanted to have children. He is married to Barbie, an aspiring actress who isn't too enthusiastic to become a mother. While Barbie is on a vacation in Las Vegas, Charlie makes a visit to the doctor and finds out he is sterile. However, five weeks later, Barbie announces she is pregnant, which means she cheated on him. Charlie immediately leaves her and later meets Beth, another orphan who is now enjoying her life as a single mother. They fall in love with each other and soon marry. Not only does Charlie become the father figure of her child, but they also decide to adopt another child.

His father served in the British Army and was present at the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill early in the American Revolutionary War, where he was promoted to the post of paymaster-sergeant for his bravery. Later, he became the inmate of a Greenwich mental asylum where he died, leaving his widow with James and his sister. James Scurry went to sea at a very early age. He went on his first voyage when he was nearly seven years old. He spent a considerable time on the American coast and the West Indies and was employed to carry gunpowder. He was also very good at playing the fife. Capture by Hyder In 1780, when Scurry was 14 years old, he set on a voyage from Plymouth Sound on the Hannibal. However, he, along with his crew, were captured by the French at Saint Helena. They were handed over to Hyder Ali by the French admiral Suffren. Hyder deported Scurry and the 15 young men to Seringapatam. The 15 men were all circumcised, converted to Islam and forcibly conscripted to Tipu's army. James Scurry was given the Islamic name, Shamsher Khan. Captivity As soon as Scurry was captured, he was put in heavy leg-irons and marched into a strong prison. Later, Hyder ordered him and his crew to march to Bangalore. Scurry was then sent to Burrampour, a three-day march from Bangalore. The food offered was rice for the first eight to ten days, which was then changed to Ragi flour. Scurry had the misfortune of being overlooked, along with 100 other English prisoners in the prisoner release incorporated in the treaty of 1784. Escape from captivity Scurry on his own account explains how he escaped from the fort of Chitterdroog (Chitradurga). Once he tried to escape with some more of his colleagues, but after some distance, returns on fears of being spotted. Again, he escapes in the next try, but this time, they venture into the forest to avoid being detected. They camp in multiple places, and try entering a couple of forts. They finally seek the help of Marathas in a fort, from where they leave for the English encampments in a fort north of Karnataka. He was greeted by an old Scottish colleague, Mr. Little, who was startled to find Scurry and his companions in the ragged uniform of Tipu's army. James further narrates how they are redeployed, and marched backwards to the Carnatic to help plan the final assault on Mysore by Lord Cornwallis. Due to some circumstances, his friends are divided into two groups, and one group is sent to Bombay, and he is sent to Madras. In Madras, he boards Dutton, a ship to send him back to England, and he reaches Down in England. He also tells that even though his release was negotiated between Tipu and the British, it was not implemented for reasons unknown. Instead he was abruptly shifted along with many other prisoners to Chitterdroog. During this shift, James fears for his life, as he was taken to a place where some of his colleagues Captain Rumney, and Lieutenants Fraser and Sampson, had their throats cut. Scurry left behind his wife and child, a girl. He had grown to love her, and in his memoir describes the immense pain he felt in having to part from them in the night as his battalion was being mustered and his decision of escaping being made. After the 10-year captivity ended, James Scurry recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the 'swarthy complexion of negroes', and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes. Scurry later reverted to Christianity, upon his return to England. Life after return to England After reaching England, Scurry took up many jobs first as a superintendent of a wholesale grocer, and then set up his own grocery business. In 1800, he married once more and had 8 children, of which only one son and one daughter survived. He moved on from his grocery business to join a colliery, and then as a steward for a merchant ship, and then moved back to London in 1816 to work for a coal wharf. His final job was to superintendent a mine, but due to cold weather, he developed severe cold and infection, and died in 1822, at the age of 57. He was buried in Exeter on December 14, 1822. Descriptions of conditions in Srirangapatna James mentions the unbearable conditions during his captivity, and also describes the tribulations, and pain he went through during his incarceration. Here are some of his comments Initiation of prisoners of war including James into Islam: Method of killing people who refused to convert or try to escape from prison: Common use of cutting hands, ears and noses as punishment: Tipu not honouring prisoner exchange by shifting prisoners from one camp to another or killing them: The scheme of threat and punishment to collect revenue from various quarters: James description of Seringapatam: The systematic rape of girls collected and captured from various parts of his kingdom was described by James. In this paragraph, James and his colleagues are forced to have sex with local girls captured from Tipu's kingdom or otherwise. The reason why Tipu chose to let prisoners have the captured women is not known, but it seems that it could have served various purposes. One was to humiliate the women themselves. Second, could have been to provide restraint to the prisoners, so it would serve as a deterrent for them to escape, as many of them had children with these women, and married them as well. Later in the story, James narrates how a British officer, could not escape the prison camp, as their guilt of leaving the women behind, kept them from escaping. So, the intent of letting the British prisoners consummate those women, was indeed useful in that regard. Account of the Captivity The following is James's first-hand account of the treatment of Mangalorean Catholic captives. Also this is the first time, James mentions that Tipu had converted some of the Hindu temples into prisons or dungeons. The practice of capturing women and passing them on as slaves to officers, and moving some of them to his harem is also mentioned. Musings of James about Tipu and his reign  James gives credit to Tipu for his actions against the British, but condemns the methods of cruelties that he unleashed on his subjects and the prisoners James also tells about the brutal character of his regime equally represented by the British and the French See also *Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam Citations References   Category:1766 births Category:1822 deaths Category:Military personnel from Devon Category:Royal Navy sailors Category:British prisoners of war Category:British memoirists Category:British Christians Category:British former Muslims Category:Converts to Christianity from Islam ","title":"James Scurry"},{"id":"23983963","text":"Battery balancer Contacts on a DeWalt 20V Max (18V XR in Europe) power tool battery. The C1-C4 contacts are connected to the individual cells in the battery and are used by the charger for battery balancing. Battery balancing and battery redistribution refer to techniques that improve the available capacity of a battery pack with multiple cells (usually in series) and increase each cell's longevity.http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00231a.pdf A battery balancer or battery regulator is an electrical device in a battery pack that performs battery balancing.Voltage controlled bypass regulator with digital interface. Manzanitamicro.com (2006-02-22). Retrieved on 2013-04-27. Balancers are often found in lithium-ion battery packs for laptop computers, electrical vehicles. etc.  Rationale  The individual cells in a battery pack naturally have somewhat different capacities, and so, over the course of charge and discharge cycles, may be at a different state of charge (SOC). Variations in capacity are due to manufacturing variances, assembly variances (e.g., cells from one production run mixed with others), cell aging, impurities, or environmental exposure (e.g., some cells may be subject to additional heat from nearby sources like motors, electronics, etc.), and can be exacerbated by the cumulative effect of parasitic loads, such as the cell monitoring circuitry often found in a battery management system (BMS). Balancing a multi-cell pack helps to maximize capacity and service life of the pack by working to maintain equivalent state-of-charge of every cell, to the degree possible given their different capacities, over the widest possible range. Balancing is only necessary for packs that contain more than one cell in series. Parallel cells will naturally balance since they are directly connected to each other, but groups of parallel wired cells, wired in series ( parallel-series wiring ) must be balanced between cell groups. To prevent undesirable, and often unsafe conditions, the battery management system must monitor the condition of individual cells for operational characteristics such as temperature, voltage, and sometimes current drawn – although the latter is often only measured per-pack rather than per-cell, perhaps with one-shot protection at the cell level against abnormally high current (such as in a short, or other failure condition.) Under normal operation, discharging must stop when any cell first runs out of charge even though other cells may still hold significant charge. Likewise, charging must stop when any cell reaches its maximum safe charging voltage. Failure to do either may cause permanent damage to the cells, or in extreme cases, may drive cells into reverse polarity, cause internal gassing, thermal runaway, or other catastrophic failures. If the cells are not balanced, such that the high and low cutoff are at least aligned with the state of the lowest capacity cell, the energy that can be taken from and returned to the battery will be limited. There are two major approaches to balancing: Passive balancing, and active balancing. Passive balancing equalizes the state of charge at some fixed point – usually either \\"top balanced\\", with all cells reaching 100% SOC at the same time; or \\"bottom balanced\\", with all cells reaching minimum SOC at the same time. This can be accomplished by bleeding energy from the cells with higher state of charge (e.g., a controlled short through a resistor or transistor), or shunting energy through a path in parallel with a cell during the charge cycle so that less of the (typically regulated constant) current is consumed by the cell. Passive balancing is inherently wasteful, with some of the pack's energy spent as heat for the sake of equalizing the state of charge between cells. The build-up of waste heat may also limit the rate at which balancing can occur. In contrast, active balancing attempts to redistribute excess energy from cells with larger capacity to those with a lower capacity, thereby taking advantage of more capacious cells. Energy can be bled from a cell at higher SOC by switching a reservoir capacitor in-circuit with the cell, then disconnecting the capacitor and reconnecting it to a cell with lower SOC, or through a DC-to-DC converter connected across the entire pack. Due to inefficiencies, some energy is still wasted as heat, but not to the same degree. Despite the obvious advantages, the additional cost and complexity of an active balancing topology can be substantial, and doesn't always make sense depending on the application. A full BMS might include active balancing as well as temperature monitoring, charging, and other features to maximize the life of a battery pack.Battery Management and Monitoring Systems BMS. Mpoweruk.com. Retrieved on 2013-04-27. Lithium ion rechargeable battery cells are rather more sensitive to overcharging, overheating, improper charge levels during storage, and other forms of mistreatment, than most commonly used battery chemistries. The reason is that the various lithium battery chemistries are susceptible to chemical damage (e.g., cathode fouling, molecular breakdown, etc.) by only very slight overvoltages (i.e., millivolts) during charging, or more charging current than the internal chemistry can tolerate at this point in its charge/discharge cycle, and so on. Heat accelerates these unwanted, but so far inescapable, chemical reactions and overheating during charging amplifies those effects. Because lithium chemistries often permit flexible membrane structures, lithium cells can be deployed in flexible though sealed bags, which permits higher packing densities within a battery pack. Some of the breakdown products (usually of electrolyte chemicals or additives) outgas when mistreated; such cells will become 'puffy' and are very much on the way to failure. In sealed lithium ion cylinders, the same outgassing has caused rather large pressures (800+ psi has been reported); such cells can explode if not provided with a pressure relief mechanism. Compounding the danger is that many lithium cell chemistries include hydrocarbon chemicals (the exact nature of which is typically proprietary) which are flammable. Not only is explosion a possibility with mistreated lithium cells, but even a non-explosive leak can cause a fire. Most battery chemistries have less dramatic, and less dangerous, failure modes. The chemicals in most batteries are often toxic to some degree, but are rarely explosive or flammable; many are corrosive, which accounts for advice to avoid leaving batteries inside equipment for long periods as the batteries may leak and damage the equipment. Lead acid batteries are an exception, for charging them generates hydrogen gas, which can explode if exposed to an ignition source (e.g., a lit cigarette ) and such an explosion will spray sulfuric acid in all directions. Since this is corrosive and potentially blinding, this is a particular danger.  Technology  Different states of charge in a battery pack. Cell 5 has lower capacity. Cell 5 has high self-discharge rate Balancing can be active or passive. The term battery regulator typically refers only to devices that perform passive balancing. In passive balancing, energy is drawn from the most charged cell and dissipated as heat, usually through resistors. In active balancing, energy is drawn from the most charged cell and transferred to the least charged cells, usually through capacitor-based, inductor-based or DC-DC converters. Battery balancing can be performed by DC- DC converters, in one of 3 topologies: * Cell-to-battery * Battery-to-cell * Bidirectional Typically, the power handled by each DC-DC converter is a few orders of magnitude lower than the power handled by the battery pack as a whole.

McElhiney (1915 – February 9, 2002) was a longtime musical arranger and trumpeter who was based in Nashville, Tennessee. He worked with many major talents, including Roy Orbison, Ray Charles, Connie Francis, Johnny Cash, Floyd Cramer, Johnny Tillotson and Patsy Cline. Danny Davis chose McElhiney to arrange for and help establish the sound of his \\"Nashville Brass\\". \\"Bill McElhiney and his Orchestra\\" released an album in 1963 (MGM 4135) entitled Bluegrass Banjo with Strings. The album featured Bob Johnson on the banjo and included the traditional standard \\"Down Yonder,\\" which became a minor hit after being released as a single (MGM 13156). Perhaps the most familiar single piece of music McElhiney contributed to was \\"Ring of Fire\\" by Johnny Cash. McElhiney teamed with Karl Garvin to provide the signature trumpets so prominent in this song. Johnny Cash was inspired to add horns \\"Ring of Fire\\" after hearing Bob Moore's 1962 instrumental hit \\"Mexico\\" which featured the twin trumpets of Bill McElhiney and Carl Garvin. In addition to the above four songs, McElhiney also made the musical arrangement for the song \\"Talk Back Trembling Lips\\" which became a #7 Billboard hit for Johnny Tillotson in 1963-64, although Ernest Ashworth sang the song originally in 1963. It was not Tillotson's highest ranking single recording though, as \\"Poetry In Motion\\" was his biggest hit, in 1960, on Cadence Records. \\"Talk Back Trembling Lips\\" was released on MGM Records as single # K13181. McElhiney did not arrange Ernest Ashworth's version. The song was written by composer John D. Loudermilk, who was from Durham, North Carolina.

Becky was created by producer Tony Wood, and made her debut in the episode airing on 5 February 2006. Kelly was initially contracted to appear for three months, but became a series regular after impressing the serial's producers. In April 2011, Kelly announced her decision to leave the soap. Producer Phil Collinson created dramatic storylines in the build-up to her exit. Becky's storylines have focused on her friendship with Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), which helped change public opinion of the character, and her relationship with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) and her marriage with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), with the latter producing two wedding storylines which were highly publicised by ITV. Other notable storylines have included her drunken rampages, two miscarriages and her desire to adopt a child. Becky is portrayed as a no-nonsense character, whose time on the show has been described as a journey. Viewers have seen her change from a \\"thieving ex-con\\" into a vulnerable woman. The character has been praised by crime-reduction charity Nacro for changing opinions on former prisoners. She has been referred to as a \\"Coronation Street icon\\", and one of the serial's most popular characters, with critics often praising her activities. However, her tendency to smoke when under stress and litter the streets with cigarettes has been criticised by UK environmental agencies. Kelly has garnered various awards and nominations for her portrayal of Becky. Character creation and casting Becky was created as a short-term recurring character, working in the Underworld sewing factory. The character was deemed popular so producers decided to bring her back, with executive producer Steve Frost initially pitching the idea of bringing in her family, stating: \\"Becky will leave Weatherfield for a short period of time and shock the Street's residents when her relatives return with her.\\" However, this never materialised and Becky returned without any relatives. It was also thought that producers were going to kill the character off, in her early stages. Auditions were held for the role of Becky which required the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: \\"I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!\\". Kelly was initially only cast for a three- month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as \\"unprecedented\\" at the time. In 2011, Kelly decided to quit the role. She said it was one of the \\"hardest decisions of her life\\" but felt it was the right time to \\"say goodbye to Becky\\". Executive producer Phil Collinson remarked that Kelly was talented and managed to make Becky into a \\"firm favourite\\" with viewers. Kelly finished filming her final scenes as Becky on 9 December 2011. Character development Characterisation The Daily Mirror Beth Neil has observed that during her time on Coronation Street, Becky has morphed \\"from a thieving tearaway into a vulnerable young woman, clearly damaged from a troubled upbringing.\\" Kelly has commented that Becky finds it hard to rely on others, as she is: \\"Very out of sorts, because she's a very independent, feisty sort of character.\\" She has stated that she loves Becky's \\"trailer trash\\" appearance. Becky Granger as she appeared in 2006. Becky is not an aspirational character, she strives to be normal, satisfied with a \\"hard up lifestyle\\". She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little in terms of her often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: \\"If someone had said to me that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out.\\" Becky became the 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con personality would give her an advantage behind the bar, explaining: \\"The previous producer, Steve Frost, loved the idea of a barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex- con so she can fight dirty like nobody else.\\" The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her cigarette butts. ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she \\"dresses to the nines\\" with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being told what to do. Kelly has also revealed that she often changes the material within scripts to play out best how she thinks Becky would act in certain situations. Kelly stated she didn't think Becky would slap other characters, rather opting for punches. She stated: \\"The script often says, 'Becky slaps Steve' but we try to find a different way to do it. I always think she wouldn't slap, she would punch\\" Kelly was behind other violent scenes featuring her character, adding \\"The slap is too common in soaps\\". Relationships Becky formed a friendship with local residents Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh). Becky's on-screen partnership with Roy was particularly successful. Kelly stated it was the turning point in her character's development that won public affection, whilst Neilson stated that it was an \\"arranged marriage\\" by producers, delighted with its outcome. Becky's first serious romantic relationship in the soap was with builder Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). Their relationship was a turning point in what has been described as a \\"journey\\" for the character. Kelly spoke of Becky's different attributes in their relationship, during an interview stating: \\"She absolutely believes that she's 100% in love with him. I see it as a very teenage relationship because of the on-off status. Becky's very mature in many ways – she's very streetwise and if you needed something, you'd go to Becky and she'd find it for you. But emotionally, she's very immature. That's a lot to do with why she gets on so well with Roy because he's quite emotionally immature, too. It's probably the one level that they do connect on.\\" Fans approached the actress in the streets, claiming they were jealous of her because of her on-screen romance with Jason. Following her breakup with Jason, and the aftermath which was highly publicised in the media, such as the Daily Mirror. She then embarked on an affair with fellow resident Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). Kelly stated during an interview that she felt Becky was \\"punching above her weight\\" with Jason. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason, stating: \\"Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, and it was no strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her.\\" When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, he was asked if he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: \\"I think he's turned it around. She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!\\" Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV, which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in a series of romantic plots which ITV dubbed the \\"Summer of Love\\" season of the soap, with advertisements airing. In 2009 Slug (Marshall Lancaster), who had been seen on-screen dating Becky in her early appearances, returned. The two characters share a backstory, which was partially created by Lancaster and Kelly themselves. During an interview with Digital Spy Kelly spoke the impact Slug has had on Becky stating: \\"Marshall and I have invented a whole back story between us. It's nice to remember where Becky came from and what a journey she's had. Slug was an important part of Becky's life – they’ve got a lot of history. They grew up together and looked out for each other.\\" The storyline progresses into Slug confessing his love for Becky. Kelly points out that Becky has been on a journey, subsequently changing, stating that \\"Becky and Slug didn't know what love was\\" and that she proves she has changed by rejecting his advances. Becky later forged a friendship with Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth), of this unlikely love/hate friendship Kelly stated: \\"Claire and Becky strike up a weird, weird friendship because the kids are a similar age, Josh and Amy. [...] So the trouble begins, One minute [Becky and Claire] are good friends and the next, they're really not.\\" Becky's relationship with her mother was never shown onscreen, but when she died Kelly stated: \\"Becky hated her, and the death has brought back a lot of bad memories.\\" In 2010 it was announced that Becky's half sister would join the cast, with Kelly stating: \\"We've got some really, really exciting stuff happening. Becky's going to get a half-sister – a younger sister\\". Kelly had stated that her family was not introduced on-screen because producers didn't want to \\"pin her character down\\" with one set of characters. Miscarriage and adoption In 2010, the character underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages. Kelly branded the storyline challenging, admitting she felt a huge responsibility to get it right, stating: \\"It's definitely been the hardest thing I've done since I've been here. I think the responsibility to do it well that you feel is huge.\\" Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding: \\"She can't really put up any barriers about this – it's the worst thing that's ever happened. She goes from being a girl to a woman, I think. I'm just devastated for her\\". Kelly brands the storyline as her hardest, \\"Most of Becky's storylines have an element of fun in there somewhere, but with this one it was just like a cloud was hanging over me for six weeks.\\" However, Becky and Steve decide to adopt, in a storyline which was originally meant for Liz McDonald (Bev Callard). It was revealed that Becky was given the storyline because producer Kim Crowther was determined to feature such a plot. Becky does not like the idea at first, thinking she would make a bad mother, but later changes her mind. The storyline saw various character changes implemented to Becky, in real life Kelly was forced to reduce the length of her hair. This was written into scripts to fit with the adoption storyline, which saw Becky changing her wardrobe to fool social workers. Of this Kelly stated: \\"With the adoption storyline, she borrows Claire Peacock's clothes for a while because she wants to look good for the social worker coming round. We thought it was a good opportunity for her to have a slight image change.\\" Kelly further spoke of her admiration of her characters former image adding: \\"I love Becky with long hair and if it could have been possible I'd have kept her with long blonde hair forever but sometimes nature and practicalities take over!\\" In an interview with tabloid newspaper Daily Mirror, Kelly revealed that she researched the storyline at the Manchester Adoption Society, who expressed their delight that two high-profile characters were given such a plot. Kelly initially thought Becky would not be able to adopt because of her criminal record, but the society pointed out that the storyline would highlight the fact that adoption is possible for previous offenders, with Kelly stating: \\"They said the two main things they look for are stability in a family and a lot of back-up at home, which Becky and Steve have with Roy, Hayley and Liz.\\" On what kind of mother Becky will be, Kelly added: \\"She'd either palm it off on Roy and Hayley and the Barlows, or she would be over-protective and not want it to have the life she had.\\" Introduction of family Producers later introduced a half- sister for Becky, in the form of Kylie Turner (Paula Lane). Kylie was initially described as having a \\"full on\\" personality, similar to Becky. When she arrives, she ruins her and Steve's plans for adoption. She and Kylie brawl violently over the incident; Lane received bruising from filming the scenes. They were so violent that they were toned down before transmission. Kelly described Kylie and Becky as having a love-hate relationship with her, but at the time she \\"wants to kill her\\". Lane herself stated that Kylie loves Becky but \\"feels resentful that she left home when she was only eight. Becky was like a mother to Kylie.\\" It is then revealed Kylie has a son, Max (Harry McDermott) who is in foster care. Lane stated that when she gets Max back, Kylie takes advantage of Becky's bond with him. In another storyline, Kylie makes a pass at Steve. Steve decides not to tell Becky because he knows Kylie will take Max away, as she is trouble. Kylie plays on the fact Becky is desperate for a child and offers to sell Max to her. Gregson said he felt it immoral to buy a child, but stressed \\"Kylie isn’t an ordinary mother – she only cares about herself.\\" He said that Steve believes Max would be better off with him and Becky. Steve is first to take Kylie seriously, Gregson believed this was because Kylie has \\"proved herself ruthless\\" and \\"not the best mum\\". Lane was so shocked with the storyline that she had to take breaks from filming scenes. Storylines Backstory Over the course of the series elements of Becky's backstory are revealed to the viewer. The character is stated to have been raised by an abusive, alcoholic mother until leaving home at the age of 14 after being raped by her mother's boyfriend. Becky was left to fend for herself until she was taken into care. Becky has mentioned living with numerous foster families, but stated that none of them were willing to adopt her as she was somewhat of a \\"wild child\\". Becky had a heavily disrupted education, having attended many schools, several of which she was expelled from. 2006–2012 Becky first appears in Weatherfield as an old friend of factory worker Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu), who first encounters Becky begging on the streets, and then later at the police station after she has been arrested for shoplifting and Kelly is retrieving her stolen handbag after previously being mugged. Kelly feels sorry for Becky and gives her some money. She then helps get Becky a job at the Underworld lingerie factory but Becky later frames Kelly for theft. After betraying Kelly, she leaves the area for several months, returning later in the year when she meets former workmate Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), who is teaching an ex-offenders literacy class. Becky promises Hayley she will reform, and is offered a job at Roy's Rolls, the cafe owned and run by Hayley's partner, Roy Cropper (David Neilson). She does not change as promised and soon begins breaking the Croppers' property, threatening customers and stealing money from the till. Slug (Marshall Lancaster), a former acquaintance of Becky's, arrives in Weatherfield and the two joyride in the Croppers' newly acquired Morris Minor. Becky loses the couple's trust and her job. Hayley refuses Becky's apologies and when the cafe catches fire and Becky is rescued from the burning building, the Croppers assume she was responsible. Hayley apologises to Becky on learning that the fire was caused by an electrical fault and the two resume their friendship, with Becky re-employed at Roy's Rolls. Becky starts dating builder Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), but after being with him for several months, she cheats on him with pub landlord Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). Jason and Becky move in together, but when Jason's ex-wife, Sarah Grimshaw (Tina O'Brien), reveals she is considering coming home, he ends things with Becky. Becky attacks Jason in The Rovers Return pub and then goes on a pub crawl, getting drunk and stealing a girl's purse in a nightclub, flashing her breasts in public, and vandalising a travel agency window and a police car. When the police bring Becky in for questioning over her actions, she encounters DC Hooch (Dominic Carter), an adversary from her past. Becky claims to have been with Steve on the night of her rampage and blackmails him to give her a false alibi, threatening to tell his partner Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) about their one-night stand. Becky reveals to Steve that Hooch arrested her for shoplifting when she was 15, and attempted to molest her. She filed a complaint against him at the time, and Hooch is determined to get his revenge as this harmed his promotion prospects. During Becky's trial, Steve develops genuine feelings for her and they begin an affair, with Steve promising to leave Michelle. Although he keeps his promise, Becky reunites with Jason, eventually leading to him proposing to her. She accepts but reconsiders when Steve proposes as well. Becky ultimately breaks up with Jason and moves in with Steve. His daughter, Amy Barlow (Amber Chadwick), initially dislikes Becky, prompting her to put their wedding on hold, though Steve eventually convinces her to set a date. Becky turns up to her wedding so drunk that the vicar refuses to perform the ceremony. They plan a second ceremony, and Slug returns, seemingly reformed but actually working for Hooch. Slug plants drugs on Becky. At Becky and Steve's second wedding, the reception is raided by police, and Becky is arrested for drug possession. Steve hires lawyers to free Becky, and afterwards Steve and Becky find Slug and convince him to tell them what Hooch has on him to make Slug even consider framing Becky. They use it to blackmail Hooch into calling a truce and drop the charges. Becky tells Steve that she is pregnant and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth); Steve tells his mother, Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard). Unfortunately, Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her second pregnancy. Medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide that she wants to adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister, Kylie Turner (Paula Lane) gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max (Harry McDermott). Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy. When Tracy is brutally attacked, Becky is arrested for the incident until Claire admits she was responsible but Becky admits looting Dev's shop, Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) is furious but does not report her. When Liz finds out she makes life hard for Becky. Becky gets drunk and attacks Kylie and forces Liz out of the pub. Steve's father, Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) offers to buy The Rovers, and with the money, Becky and Steve decide to start a new life abroad and steal Amy. Jim's attempts to rob a bank fail and they are forced to cancel their plans. Steve calls Social Services to check on Max and they take him into care. Becky believes Tracy made the call and smashes her front room up with a sledge-hammer. Before she can hit Tracy, Steve confesses. Becky walks out on Steve and goes off the rails once more. Becky, still crushed over her betrayal by Steve, stays with Roy and Hayley. While Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) is in prison, Becky takes part in helping Hayley take care of baby Hope (Harriet Atkins and Sadie Pilbury), whom she grows very close to and struggles to hand her back to Fiz. Becky is upset when she discovers that Tracy is pregnant with Steve's twins. While not wishing for anything bad to happen to the twins, she still knows that any chance of getting back together with Steve is well and truly finished because of this. Becky goes on a business meeting with Steve and attempts to seduce him, while Tracy suffers a miscarriage with Deirdre by her side. Tracy assumes Steve is sleeping with Becky and goes to see her. While at Becky's apartment, Becky admits she still loves Steve and would do anything to get him back. This angers Tracy and she attempts to leave the apartment, an emotional wreck. While leaving, Tracy falls down the stairs. Becky calls the ambulance and when Tracy arrives at the hospital, she tells Steve that she lost the babies because of Becky pushing her down the stairs. Tracy's mother, Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) is shocked, knowing that Tracy lost the babies before this incident. Steve believes Tracy. When most of the street turns against Becky, including Roy and Hayley, she is miserable and lonely on Christmas Day. She overhears Steve propose to Tracy which further upsets her. Becky gets drunk by herself in her apartment and burns photographs of her and Steve on their wedding day. While burning the pictures, she falls asleep on the couch and a fire starts in her flat. Becky is saved from the fire by Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and later vows to gain revenge on Tracy once and for all. Becky begins dating Danny Stratton (Jeremy Sheffield), the man she met at the business meeting with Steve. She gets along perfectly with Danny, as well as his young son, Billy (Wade Sayers). Just as things looked perfect for Becky, Danny reveals that he is moving to Barbados because of his hotel business. When he spots Tracy outside The Rovers, he recognises her and reveals to Becky that Tracy lost the babies before her fall. Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) helps Becky retrieve Tracy's medical records which confirm she is lying. Gail and the rest of the Platts can't wait to see the smile ripped off of Tracy's face when Becky reveals the medical records, and Becky tells them that she is going to do it on Tracy and Steve's wedding day. Becky exposes Tracy's lies after the wedding reception at The Rovers. Tracy is hysterical, and nobody believes her anymore. After exposing Tracy, she says her goodbyes to Kylie, Roy and Hayley and takes up Danny's offer to fly to Barbados with him. Realising he still loves Becky, Steve tries to stop her, to no avail. Becky boards the flight with Danny and departs. She later becomes engaged to Danny. Becky intends to return to Weatherfield for Kylie's funeral; however, she is unable to make the long trip due to an ear infection. Reception Critical response The character has been praised by Nacro, a crime reduction charity which aims to tackle social exclusion and reintegrate offenders. Kelly was concerned they may find Becky to be a caricature, but was pleased to learn they enjoyed Becky being portrayed in a positive light. Media website Digital Spy deemed Kelly a Coronation Street \\"icon\\" when the Radio Times had her recreate Manet's famous painting, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère. Kris Green of the same website branded Becky's rampage storyline as a repeat of a previous plot in which David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) smashed up Coronation Street, while Daniel Kilkelly had branded Becky as a \\"hellraiser\\". TV critic Nancy Banks-Smith praised the character in 2008, calling Becky \\"the strongest new character since Raquel (Watts) of blessed memory\\", while The Daily Mirror Beth Neil called Becky Coronation Street \\"most outrageous character\\", as well as \\"one of the soap's most popular characters\\". Kelly credited the producers' decision to pair her character with Roy and Hayley Cropper as the moment public support for Becky rose, stating: \\"The Croppers were the making of Becky, and without them I actually don't think Becky would still be in the show. The Croppers, especially Roy, were the thing that really turned public opinion [about Becky] around to being positive.\\" Grace Dent of The Guardian commented on Becky's wedding describing her appearance as: \\"[Wearing an] Oil-stained pink princess frock carrying a two-litre bottle of street-drinker fuel, shouting football chants, with the words eruditely swapped to honour the groom. Becky's beehive lurched like a detonated high rise, her lip colour swept westward on to her earlobe, a Regal King Size blazed in her gob.\\" With their wedding ruined, Dent commented that although it was karma, they didn't deserve it because \\"Viewers want Steve and Becky to be together\\". Telecommunication company Orange state that Becky is well known for \\"her love of cheap cider and Regal King Size's\\". Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture often praises Becky in her monthly columns featuring popular and unpopular soap opera characters. Of Becky she states: \\"Every scene she's in sparkles and she's been a very welcome presence in the Street this past year or so. Long may Queen Becky reign.\\" Deller has also praised her friendship with Claire branding it as good direction for the characters, stating: \\"Claire has made the very smart move of becoming mates with HRH Queen Becky recently. This can only be a good thing, as everything Becky touches turns to gold.\\" Francine Cohen of the Daily Mirror commented on Becky's storylines stating: \\"Becky’s plots have ranged from drug busts to drunken rampages, but the most poignant yet has been her recent pregnancy, miscarriage and subsequent infertility.\\" Channel 5's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap recall Becky's most memorable moment as being her failed wedding attempt and joked: \\"She might not remember her first wedding day but we all do!\\" The storyline which featured the character's old nemesis DC Hooch drew criticism of Becky's excessive littering of her cigarette butts. Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: \\"It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow one of its characters to throw a butt on the floor and suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. We understand the writers are concerned with realism but Becky is a role model to many viewers. We all have a responsibility to keep our local area clean and we would hope that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would support our call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy.\\" A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll to find out which character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she \\"loved a good TV scrap\\" and the serial had \\"a corker\\" with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror praised Becky's feud with Tracy, explaining it was a \\"perfectly poised, barbed battle\\". Though he said it was ruined by Kylie's return. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror said that Becky had a \\"seismic departure\\" as she \\"checked out of soapland's asylum in characteristically crazy style\\". He added that \\"barking Becky\\" left \\"hell town Weatherfield\\" after much soul-searching. O'Sullivan opined that the \\"corrie cobbles\\" would not be the same without Becky. Although, he felt it was a \\"shame the only storyline she ever had was the stuck record of her rancid relationship with mad Mr McDonald.\\" Christopher Couture, founder of self- titled celebrity gossip blog ChristopherCouture.co.uk, described Kelly as \\"the new Bet Lynch\\" on Twitter, following her final episode. Laura Morgan of All About Soap said that Becky's exit will \\"go down in soap history as one of the best\\". In September 2012, Inside Soap named Becky's exit as their number 2 happy ending, \\"Becky believed the world expected the worst of her, and thought it her duty to deliver the goods – generally with a strain of White Diamond cider spending down the front of her wedding dress. Steve loved Becky, but her inability to have kids made her insecure – and Tracy exploited that pain in order to drive the pair apart. Happily, Becky won her revenge in the end, and moved to Barbados with Jeremy Sheffield [who played Danny]. The jammy so-and- so.\\" Accolades Kelly has won and been nominated for a variety of awards for her portrayal of Becky. In 2009, she was named \\"Best Female Soap Star\\" at the TV Now Awards, \\"TV Soap Personality of the Year\\" at the Television and Radio Industries Club awards and \\"Best Actress\\" at the British Soap Awards.

Agnes Mathilde Wergeland was the first woman ever to earn a doctoral degree in Norway.Norwegian-Americans (Odd S. Lovoll. Multicultural America. 2006) Early life and education Agnes Mathilde Wergeland was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway to Sverre Nicolai Wergeland (1817–96) and Anne Margrethe Larsen (1817–89). She was from a prominent, distinguished Norwegian family. Wergeland's family hailed from Brekke in Sogn. Her brother was Norwegian painter, Oscar Wergeland. She was the great-niece of Norwegian writer and politician, Nicolai Wergeland; hence Henrik Wergeland, Camilla Collett and Joseph Frantz Oscar Wergeland were the cousins of her father. She attended Nissen Girls School in Christiania in 1879, studied independently Norwegian history, Greek and Roman architecture and sculpture, and medieval history at the University Library of Christiania from 1879 until 1883. Then she studied Old Norse and Icelandic law under jurist Konrad von Maurer at the University of Munich from 1883 to 1885. She then attended the University of Zurich, whence she took her PhD in 1890. Wergeland emigrated to America because there were few opportunities for women in higher education in Norway.The Scandinavian Immigrant Writer in America (Dorothy Burton Skardal, Norwegian- American Historical Association. Volume 21: Page 14) Career The Doctors' Inn in Laramie Hebard and Wergeland plot in Greenhill Cemetery She received a fellowship in history from Bryn Mawr College in 1890 and lectured there for two years before lecturing at the University of Illinois in 1893. She was a docent in history and nonresident instructor at the University of Chicago from 1896 to 1902. In 1902, Wergeland was offered the position of chair of the department of history at the University of Wyoming. Agnes Mathilde Wergeland wrote several scholarly works, three of which were published after her death. She also wrote two volumes of poetry which were published by Symra in the Norwegian language: Amerika, og andre digte (1912) and Efterladte digte ( 1914 ).Larry Emil Scott The Poetry of Agnes Mathilde Wergeland (Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 30: Page 273) Wergeland lived with Grace Raymond Hebard, and Grace's sister, Alice, in the home she built with Hebard in Laramie, known to students and colleagues as \\"The Doctors Inn\\". Wergeland died in 1914. Grace's sister, Alice Marvin Hebard, died in 1928, and Hebard in 1938. Agnes Wergeland remained a University of Wyoming history professor until her death. Before she died at age 57, she testified her book collection to the library of the University of Wyoming. She is buried alongside Grace Raymond Hebard at Greenhill Cemetery, Laramie, Albany County, Wyoming.The Promise of America (Nasjonalbiblioteket, avdeling Oslo) Legacy An endowment fund was given as a memorial to the University of Oslo for Norwegian women students to study history and economics in the United States. A scholarship in history was also established by professor Grace Raymond Hebard to honor her friend and colleague, Agnes Wergeland, as one of the pioneering members of the History Department to the University of Wyoming.Mathilde Wergeland Memorial History Prize (University of Wyoming) In 1916, Maren Michelet wrote a biography Glimt fra Agnes Mathilde Wergelands liv. She also wrote an English language translation, Glimpses from Agnes Mathilde Wergeland's life.

Inexpensive, but of good quality, the pistol achieved considerable success at contemporary shooting competitionsKoelliker, Donald W., \\"Ortgies: A Well-Known but Little Studied German Armsmaker of the Early Post-War Years,\\" Gun Collector's Digest 1981, accessed April 19, 2010 and, as an export product, was popular throughout the Americas.REME Museum of Technology Internet site, accessed April 19, 2010. Design Ortgies cutaway diagram The pistol was produced in , , and Kurz variants, all using blowback as their operating mechanism. Although not expensive, at the time it was of advanced design and high quality construction with relatively few parts, well sealed against dirt. Metal components were forged or machined, and assembly in general made no use of screws, even securing the wooden grips with metal clips, although some examples do incorporate a single screw for that purpose. The hammerless action depended on a spring-loaded striker to fire the cartridge. As in early Colt and Browning pocket pistols, the Ortgies striker also operated as an ejector as the slide traveled backwards after discharge. Unusual design features included the safety and the magazine. The safety was a lever inset into the back of the grip and, with the gun cocked, forced backward out of the grip into the \\"safe\\" position by spring tension from the firing pin upon depression of a button under the slide. Thus, engaging the safety simultaneously reduced tension on the firing pin spring. To disengage the safety, a shooter simply would squeeze the grip, pressing the lever forward and locking it flush with the back of the frame. At least the earlier Ortgies magazines could accommodate both 7.65mm (aka .32 ACP) and Kurz, (aka .380 ACP) ammunition and were interchangeable between pistols of either calibre. One side of the magazine was marked for and featured seven holes showing the positions that cartridges of that size would occupy when loaded; the other side had similar holes and markings for cartridges. Modern replacement magazines are purpose-built for one caliber only. Production Ortgies-Pistols 1919–1921 Ortgies-Pistols 1921–1924 Heinrich Ortgies designed the pistol while living in Liège, Belgium during World War I.\\"Deutsche Werke – Ortgies,\\" Belgian Littlegun Internet site, referencing Ian Hogg and John Weeks, Pistols of the World, accessed April 19, 2010 After the war, he moved to Erfurt, Germany, where in 1919 he commenced production of the pistol in his own factory. The weapons bore the mark \\"Ortgies & Co. – Erfurt\\" on their slides and a circular brass insert in their grips marked with a stylized \\"HO.\\" Ortgies died later that year, and eventually production of his pistol passed to Deutsche Werke, a shipbuilding company headquartered in Berlin. For a short time thereafter, the slide marking was changed to \\"Deutsche Werke Aktiengesellschaft Berlin\\" before changing again to \\"Deutsche Werke Aktiengesellschaft Werke Erfurt,\\" ultimately shortened to \\"Deutsche Werke – Werke Erfurt.\\" Deutsche Werke pistols continued to feature the \\"HO\\" brass grip inset until relatively late in their production, when they substituted one with a new trademark depicting a stylized crouching cat with long tail forming an S-curve over its back. In keeping with prevalent economics in Germany at the time, factory finishes were limited to bluing or, rarely, nickel. The latter finish could be either matte or bright. No Ortgies pistol was produced with a chrome finish or, aside from one known salesman's sample, with factory engraving. Production ceased in 1924. Performance The Ortgies was a well-balanced, sturdy weapon that found considerable favor in competitive shooting. In 1921, prize winners at some 70% of principal shooting competitions had chosen Ortgies pistols, and the winner of the German championship on September 26, 1921, at Halensee, Germany, took the prize firing an Ortgies.

The supporting cast features Frances Bavier, who later played \\"Aunt Bee\\" on television's The Andy Griffith Show. Director Ross was married to Caulfield, the film's leading lady.  Plot  Bill Shelby (David Niven) is a globe- trotting author and photographer on assignment from Life magazine to do a photo story on Dorinda Hatch (Joan Caulfield), best-selling author of the title book, \\"The Lady Says 'No'\\". Rather than finding a dour spinster, as he expects, she is a young blonde woman he finds attractive. Her interactions with him lead her to question her feminist convictions, such as it being unsuitable for a woman to illogically fall in love with someone she also loathes. The unbidden thoughts and impulses even invade her subconscious in a dream sequence. It is a battle of the sexes, and the id and ego, as the two clash. Bill tries to show her that her book is \\"all rot\\"; Dorinda tries to prove her theories that love is just an autonomic function and not really worth it. They find that they all have a lot to learn, and forgive. It looks like sometimes the answer is \\"no\\", and sometimes \\"yes\\". Mayhem follows, when her errant uncle returns, and they get pulled into the lives of the colorful local characters. A barroom brawl ensues when Bill rebuffs Dorinda's attempts at seducing him and she proceeds to charm all the single men there. One of those men is a married man named Potsie. Goldie, his wife, confronts Dorinda in the powder room. Talking her way out of the fight, Dorinda asks Goldie if she would be better off without Potsie, and she says yes because she thinks he's a jerk. There is a timeskip and Dorinda learns that Goldie has left Potsie, who's gone to live with Bill in Bill's trailer. Dorinda collects Goldie, who has practically memorized Dorinda's book, and goes to find the men. When they won't come out of the trailer, Dorinda steals Bill's car and drags the trailer into the military base, leading to a high speed police pursuit. Still, Potsie won't come out. A misunderstanding leads to the General being notified of a flying saucer report and coming to the trailer scene. He orders Potsie to exit and talk to his wife, with whom he reconciles after Dorinda tells Goldie that her book is stupid and that she's sorry that she ever wrote it because Potsie and Goldie love each other and belong together in spite of the fighting. Dorinda packs her bags and moves out of her aunt's home while her aunt and uncle reconcile. She's off in her car to find Bill and confess her feelings. Bill explains away the folly of her feminist views and her book as an obsession with sexual repression that appeals to the sexually repressed. Dorinda throws Goldie's copy of her book into the ocean and resolves to write a book entitled 27 Ways to Say Yes.

He was particularly known for his work within musical comedy, between broadway, films and television series. Biography Collins made his Broadway debut in 1927 in Harry Akst's Artists and Models. He went on to star in several Broadway productions during the 1930s, including Ripples (1930), where he met Dorothy Stone. In 1931, he married Dorothy in London on 12 September 1931. He starred in Smiling Faces (1932), Say When (1935), Conjur Man Dies (1936), Macbeth (1936), and Sea Legs (1937) (with Dorothy). During this time he also began to appear in Hollywood musical films beginning with Shave It with Music in 1932 (with Dorothy). His other film roles during this decade included the roles of Baxter in Paree, Paree (1934) (with Dorothy Stone and Bob Hope), and Jonathan Pride in Dancing Pirate (1936). He also recorded music for the 1934 film Those Were the Days. Collins appeared in two films during the 1940s: Syncopation (1942) and Swing Hostess (1944). He recorded the song \\"Don't Dilly Dally on the Way\\" for the 1946 film London Town. He returned to Broadway in 1945 to portray Boris Kolenkhov in You Can't Take It with You (with Dorothy Stone and Fred Stone), and again in 1947 to portray Gaston in The Red Mill (with Dorothy). In 1951 he made his first television appearance as a guest star on the Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok program. He appeared in small parts in three more films during the 1950s, Confidence Girl (1952), The Steel Trap (1952), and A Blueprint for Murder (1953), after which his career considerably slowed down. After an absence from Broadway of more than 25 years, Collins returned to New York in 1973 for his final Broadway appearance in the musical Shelter. He later served as the stage manager for the Broadway musical Platinum.

One segment begins at Highway 367 in Judsonia and runs north to Highway 14 near Oil Trough. A second, short industrial access road also carries the Highway 157 designation in Diaz. Both routes are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). One of the oldest roads through the region, the path of present-day Highway 157 was part of the original Southwest Trail in the 1820s, as was used by Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis' Army of the Southwest during the Pea Ridge Campaign of the Civil War. Highway 157 became a state highway in 1937, and was extended over the years during periods of system expansion. The Diaz segment was created in 1976. Route description Both segments of Highway 157 are two-lane undivided highways. No segment of Highway 157 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Judsonia to Oil Trough Louis Gray Homestead Barn stood alongside Highway 157 from 1932 until it was demolished in 2016. Highway 157 begins in Judsonia at Highway 367 on the edge of the Central Arkansas region. The highway runs north as Sunny Dale Road, exiting the city limits and passing over a full interchange with US Highway 64 (US 64), which is concurrent with US 67 and US 167\\\\. This freeway was designated part of Future Interstate 57 (I-57) in 2017. Highway 157 continues northbound through a rural agricultural area, dotted with historic farmhouses like the 1905 Capt. Larned House, Morris Hartsell Farmstead, and the Hilger Homestead, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The highway becomes a section line road and junctions several minor state highways: Highway 13, Highway 385 at Plainview, and Highway 258 south of Providence. In northern White County, Highway 157 begins to wind and curve, intersecting Highway 124 at Sunnyside before entering Independence County. Highway 157 in Pleasant Plains, Arkansas. Entering Pleasant Plains, a small town in southern Independence County, Highway 157 passes through downtown before an intersection with Highway 87 (Floral Road). Highway 87 continues westward to Floral, and Highway 157 turns east as Blackland Road. Highway 157 intersects US 167 along the eastern city limits of Pleasant Plains before turning northeast. The route runs becomes Blackland Road and runs towards Oil Trough, where it terminates at Highway 14. The ArDOT maintains Highway 157 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. For 2016, the highest traffic levels were estimated in downtown Pleasant Plains, with 7,600 vehicles per day (VPD). The highest estimated traffic outside city limits was between Fairview and Providence, with 2,600 VPD. The lowest AADT levels were the 830 VPD near the northern terminus. Diaz Highway 157 begins at Highway 17/Highway 18 (Main Street) in northern Diaz, a small town in the rural Arkansas Delta. Known as Tucker Road, the highway runs due east as a section line road through an agricultural industrial area until intersecting Highway 367, where it terminates. As of 2016, the route had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,900 vehicles per day (VPD). History Highway 157 first appears on the 1937 state highway map. It ran from US 67 to Providence in northern White County. It was extended north to the Independence County line in 1945, and to Highway 11 in Pleasant Plains in 1953. Following Act 9 of 1973, the highway was extended to the current northern terminus near Oil Trough.. However, Act 9 of 1973 permitted a maximum of 12 miles (19 km) to be added to the state highway system per county, leaving the extension 0.47 miles (0.76 km) short of Highway 14. The gap was added to the system on February 27, 1974.. Following a new alignment of US 167 in Pleasant Plains, Highway 157 was also rerouted in November 14, 2000. The Diaz segment was created on January 29, 1976.. It was realigned in 1994 at the request of the mayor of Diaz.

Unlike up and down quarks, from which everyday matter is made, heavier quark flavors such as strangeness and charm typically approach chemical equilibrium in a dynamic evolution process. QGP (also known as quark matter) is an interacting localized assembly of quarks and gluons at thermal (kinetic) and not necessarily chemical (abundance) equilibrium. The word plasma signals that color charged particles (quarks and/or gluons) are able to move in the volume occupied by the plasma. The abundance of strange quarks is formed in pair- production processes in collisions between constituents of the plasma, creating the chemical abundance equilibrium. The dominant mechanism of production involves gluons only present when matter has become a quark–gluon plasma. When quark–gluon plasma disassembles into hadrons in a breakup process, the high availability of strange antiquarks helps to produce antimatter containing multiple strange quarks, which is otherwise rarely made. Similar considerations are at present made for the heavier charm flavor, which is made at the beginning of the collision process in the first interactions and is only abundant in the high-energy environments of CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Quark–gluon plasma in the early universe and in the laboratory nuclei create an extremely dense environment, in which quarks and gluons may interact as free particles for brief moments. The collisions happened at such extreme velocities that the nuclei are \\"pancaked\\" because of Lorentz contraction. Free quarks probably existed in the extreme conditions of the very early universe until about 30 microseconds after the Big Bang, in a very hot gas of free quarks, antiquarks and gluons. This gas is called quark–gluon plasma (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge (color charge) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different vacuum state, in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can; they are deconfined (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this deconfined phase of matter in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum energy density. Scientists achieve this using particle collisions at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark–gluon plasma that can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10−22 s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called hadronization. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10–40 microseconds. Discovery of this new QGP state of matter has been announced both at CERN and at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Preparatory work, allowing for these discoveries, was carried out at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) at the Bevalac. New experimental facilities, FAIR at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research (GSI) and NICA at JINR, are under construction. Strangeness as a signature of QGP was first explored in 1983. Comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled. Recent work by the ALICE collaboration at CERN has opened a new path to study of QGP and strangeness production in very high energy pp collisions. Strangeness in quark–gluon plasma The diagnosis and the study of the properties of quark–gluon plasma can be undertaken using quarks not present in matter seen around us. The experimental and theoretical work relies on the idea of strangeness enhancement. This was the first observable of quark–gluon plasma proposed in 1980 by Johann Rafelski and Rolf Hagedorn. Unlike the up and down quarks, strange quarks are not brought into the reaction by the colliding nuclei. Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \\"freshly\\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei, with gluons being the catalyst. Conveniently, the mass of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other hadrons dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached. An even stronger signature of strangeness enhancement is the highly enhanced production of strange antibaryons. An early comprehensive review of strangeness as a signature of QGP was presented by Koch, Müller and Rafelski, which was recently updated. The abundance of produced strange anti-barions, and in particular anti-omega \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}(\\\\bar{s}\\\\bar{s}\\\\bar{s}), allowed to distinguish fully deconfined large QGP domain from transient collective quark models such as the color rope model proposed by Biró, Nielsen and Knoll. The relative abundance of \\\\phi (s\\\\bar{s})/\\\\bar{\\\\Xi}(\\\\bar{q}\\\\bar{s}\\\\bar{s}) resolves questions raised by the canonical model of strageness enhancement.  Equilibrium of strangeness in quark–gluon plasma  One cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium. In general, the quark-flavor composition of the plasma varies during its ultra short lifetime as new flavors of quarks such as strangeness are cooked up inside. The up and down quarks from which normal matter is made are easily produced as quark-antiquark pairs in the hot fireball because they have small masses. On the other hand, the next lightest quark flavor—strange quarks—will reach its high quark–gluon plasma thermal abundance provided that there is enough time and that the temperature is high enough. This work elaborated the kinetic theory of strangness production proposed by T. Biro and J. Zimanyi who demonstrated that strange quarks could not be produced fast enough alone by quark-antiquark reactions. A new mechanism operational alone in QGP was proposed. Gluon fusion into strangeness alt= Yield equilibration of strangeness yield in QGP is only possible due to a new process, gluon fusion, as shown by Rafelski and Müller. The top section of the Feynman diagrams figure, shows the new gluon fusion processes: gluons are the wavy lines; strange quarks are the solid lines; time runs from left to right. The bottom section is the process where the heavier quark pair arises from the lighter pair of quarks shown as dashed lines. The gluon fusion process occurs almost ten times faster than the quark- based strangeness process, and allows achievement of the high thermal yield where the quark based process would fail to do so during the duration of the \\"micro-bang\\". The ratio of newly produced \\\\bar{s}s pairs with the normalized light quark pairs \\\\bar{u}u+\\\\bar{d}d/2—the Wroblewski ratio—is considered a measure of efficacy of strangeness production. This ratio more than doubles in heavy ion collisions, providing a model independent confirmation of a new mechanism of strangeness production operating in collisions that are producing QGP. Regarding charm and bottom flavour: the gluon collisions here are occurring within the thermal matter phase and thus are different from the high energy processes that can ensue in the early stages of the collisions when the nuclei crash into each other. The heavier, charm and bottom quarks are produced there dominantly. The study in relativistic nuclear (heavy ion) collisions of charmed and soon also bottom hadronic particle production—beside strangeness—will provide complementary and important confirmation of the mechanisms of formation, evolution and hadronization of quark–gluon plasma in the laboratory. Strangeness (and charm) hadronization alt= These newly cooked strange quarks find their way into a multitude of different final particles that emerge as the hot quark–gluon plasma fireball breaks up, see the scheme of different processes in figure. Given the ready supply of antiquarks in the \\"fireball\\", one also finds a multitude of antimatter particles containing more than one strange quark. On the other hand, in a system involving a cascade of nucleon-nucleon collisions, multi-strange antimatter are produced less frequently considering that several relatively improbable events must occur in the same collision process. For this reason one expects that the yield of multi-strange antimatter particles produced in the presence of quark matter is enhanced compared to conventional series of reactions. Strange quarks also bind with the heavier charm and bottom quarks which also like to bind with each other. Thus, in the presence of a large number of these quarks, quite unusually abundant exotic particles can be produced; some of which have never been observed before. This should be the case in the forthcoming exploration at the new Large Hadron Collider at CERN of the particles that have charm and strange quarks, and even bottom quarks, as components. Strange hadron decay and observation Universality of transverse mass spectra of strange baryons and antibaryons as measured by CERN-WA97 collaboration. Collisions at 158 A GeV. These results demonstrate that all these particles are produced in explosively hadronizing fireball (of QGP) and do not undergo further interaction once produced. This key result shows therefore formation a new state of matter announced at CERN in February 2000. Strange quarks are naturally radioactive and decay by weak interactions into lighter quarks on a timescale that is extremely long compared with the nuclear-collision times. This makes it relatively easy to detect strange particles through the tracks left by their decay products. Consider as an example the decay of a negatively charged \\\\Xi baryon (green in figure, dss), into a negative pion (d) and a neutral \\\\Lambda (uds) baryon. Subsequently, the \\\\Lambda decays into a proton and another negative pion. In general this is the signature of the decay of a \\\\Xi. Although the negative \\\\Omega (sss) baryon has a similar final state decay topology, it can be clearly distinguished from the \\\\Xi because its decay products are different. Measurement of abundant formation of \\\\Xi (uss/dss), \\\\Omega (sss) and especially their antiparticles is an important cornerstone of the claim that quark–gluon plasma has been formed. This abundant formation is often presented in comparison with the scaled expectation from normal proton-proton collisions; however, such a comparison is not a necessary step in view of the large absolute yields which defy conventional model expectations. The overall yield of strangeness is also larger than expected if the new form of matter has been achieved. However, considering that the light quarks are also produced in gluon fusion processes, one expects increased production of all hadrons. The study of the relative yields of strange and non strange particles provides information about the competition of these processes and thus the reaction mechanism of particle production. Systematics of strange matter and antimatter creation alt= The work of Koch, Muller, Rafelski predicts that in a quark–gluon plasma hadronization process the enhancement for each particle species increases with the strangeness content of the particle. The enhancements for particles carrying one, two and three strange or antistrange quarks were measured and this effect was demonstrated by the CERN WA97 experiment in time for the CERN announcement in 2000 of a possible quark–gluon plasma formation in its experiments. These results were elaborated by the successor collaboration NA57 as shown in the enhancement of antibaryon figure. The gradual rise of the enhancement as a function of the variable representing the amount of nuclear matter participating in the collisions, and thus as a function of the geometric centrality of nuclear collision strongly favors the quark–gluon plasma source over normal matter reactions. A similar enhancement was obtained by the STAR experiment at the RHIC. Here results obtained when two colliding systems at 100 A GeV in each beam are considered: in red the heavier Gold-Gold collisions and in blue the smaller Copper-Copper collisions. The energy at RHIC is 11 times greater in the CM frame of reference compared to the earlier CERN work. The important result is that enhancement observed by STAR also increases with the number of participating nucleons. We further note that for the most peripheral events at the smallest number of participants, copper and gold systems show, at the same number of participants, the same enhancement as expected. Another remarkable feature of these results, comparing CERN and STAR, is that the enhancement is of similar magnitude for the vastly different collision energies available in the reaction. This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark–gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark–gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded. ALICE: Resolution of remaining questions about strangeness as signature of quark–gluon plasma alt= alt= The very high precision of (strange) particle spectra and large transverse momentum coverage reported by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) allows in-depth exploration of lingering challenges, which always accompany new physics, and here in particular the questions surrounding strangeness signature. Among the most discussed challenges has been the question if the abundance of particles produced is enhanced or if the comparison base line is suppressed. Suppression is expected when a otherwise absent quantum number, such as strangeness, is rarely produced. This situation was recognized by Hagedorn in his early analysis of particle production and solved by Rafelski and Danos. In that work it was shown that even if just a few new pairs of strange particles were produced the effect disappears. However, the matter was revived by Hamieh et al. who argued that is possible that small sub-volumes in QGP are of relevance. This argument can be resolved by exploring specific sensitive experimental signatures for example the ratio of double strange particles of different type, such yield of ssq (\\\\Xi) compared to \\\\bar{s}s(\\\\phi). The ALICE experiment obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of hadronization volumes as described by the total produced particle multiplicy. The results show that this ratio assumes the expected value for a large range volumes (two orders of magnitude). At small particle volume or multiplicity, the curve shows the expected reduction: The ssq (\\\\Xi) must be smaller compared to \\\\bar{s}s(\\\\phi) as the number of produced strange pairs decreases and thus it easier to make \\\\bar{s}s(\\\\phi) compared to ssq (\\\\Xi) that requires two pairs minimum to be made. However, we also see an increase at very high volume—this is an effect at the level of one-two standard deviations. Similar results were already recognized before by Petran et al. . Another highly praised ALICE result is the observation of same strangeness enhancement, not only on AA (nucleus- nucleus) but also in pA (proton-nucleus) and pp (proton-proton) collisions when the particle production yields are presented as a function of the multiplicity, which, as noted, corresponds to the available hadronization volume. ALICE results display a smooth volume dependence of total yield of all studied particles as function of volume, there is no additional \\"canonical\\" suppression. This is so since the yield of strange pairs in QGP is sufficiently high and tracks well the expected abundance increase as the volume and lifespan of QGP increases. This increase is incompatible with the hypothesis that for all reaction volumes QGP is always in chemical (yield) equilibrium of strangeness. Instead, this confirms the theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and Müller. The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all, but should not be a surprise. The onset of deconfinement is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size. The fact that at extreme LHC energies we cross this boundary also in experiments with the smallest elementary collision systems, such as pp, confirms the unexpected strength of the processes leading to QGP formation. Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \\"small\\" system collisions remains an active research topic. Beyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of charm and bottom flavor. When QGP is formed, these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example . Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time, are also likely to appear.  S-S and S-W collisions at SPS-CERN with projectile energy 200 GeV per nucleon on fixed target  alt= Quantitative comparison of \\\\bar{\\\\Lambda} yield created in S-S with that in up- scaled p-p (squares) collision as a function of rapidity. Collisions at 200 A GeV. Looking back to the beginning of the CERN heavy ion program one sees de facto announcements of quark–gluon plasma discoveries. The CERN-NA35 and CERN- WA85 experimental collaborations announced \\\\bar{\\\\Lambda} formation in heavy ion reactions in May 1990 at the Quark Matter Conference, Menton, France. The data indicates a significant enhancement of the production of this antimatter particle comprising one antistrange quark as well as antiup and antidown quarks. All three constituents of the \\\\bar{\\\\Lambda} particle are newly produced in the reaction. The WA85 results were in agreement with theoretical predictions. In the published report, WA85 interpreted their results as QGP. NA35 had large systematic errors in its data, which were improved in the following years. Moreover, the collaboration needed to evaluate the pp- background.These results are presented as function of the variable called rapidity which characterizes the speed of the source. The peak of emission indicates that the additionally formed antimatter particles do not originate from the colliding nuclei themselves, but from a source that moves at a speed corresponding to one-half of the rapidity of the incident nucleus that is a common center of momentum frame of reference source formed when both nuclei collide, that is, the hot quark–gluon plasma fireball. Horn in K \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi ratio and the onset of deconfinement The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged kaons and pions as a function of collision energy in collisions of two lead nuclei and proton–proton interactions.One of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely. It is natural to expect that if such a threshold exists the particle yields/ratios we have shown above should indicate that. One of the most accessible signatures would be the relative Kaon yield ratio. A possible structure has been predicted, and indeed, an unexpected structure is seen in the ratio of particles comprising the positive kaon K (comprising anti s-quarks and up-quark) and positive pion particles, seen in the figure (solid symbols). The rise and fall (square symbols) of the ratio has been reported by the CERN NA49. The reason the negative kaon particles do not show this \\"horn\\" feature is that the s-quarks prefer to hadronize bound in the Lambda particle, where the counterpart structure is observed. Data point from BNL-RHIC-STAR (red stars) in figure agree with the CERN data. In view of these results the objective of ongoing NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN SPS and the proposed low energy run at BNL RHIC where in particular the STAR detector can search for the onset of production of quark–gluon plasma as a function of energy in the domain where the horn maximum is seen, in order to improve the understanding of these results, and to record the behavior of other related quark–gluon plasma observables. Outlook The strangeness production and its diagnostic potential as a signature of quark–gluon plasma has been discussed for nearly 30 years. The theoretical work in this field today focuses on the interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark–gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark–gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own data analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. There are as many as 10–15 different particles species that follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.  Conferences and meetings  Scientists studying strangeness as signature of quark gluon plasma present and discuss their results at specialized meetings. Well established is the series International Conference on Strangeness in Quark Matter, first organized in Tucson, Arizona, in 1995. The latest edition, 10–15 June 2019, of the conference was held in Bari, Italy, attracting about 300 participants. A more general venue is the Quark Matter conference, which last time took place from 4–9 November 2019 in Wuhan, China, attracting 800 participants.

The two ships of the class were built upon a British design and were a modified version of the Royal Navy′s . Baleares was constructed in Spain by the Vickers-Armstrongs subsidiary Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval, and saw service during the Spanish Civil War, when she was torpedoed and sunk by destroyers of the Spanish Republican Navy during the Battle of Cape Palos. History In December 1936, Baleares was commissioned in an incomplete state, not mounting the fourth turret.The turret was installed by June 1937.Chesneau, p. 401 Spanish Civil War On 12 July 1937, Baleares encountered six Republican destroyers escorting two merchant vessels near Valencia. After a brief exchange of fire, the Republican ships escaped. In the afternoon of 7 September 1937, Baleares encountered four Republican merchant ships escorted by the cruisers and and six destroyers off Algeria in what became known as the Battle of Cape Cherchell. While the destroyers and merchants broke off the engagement, Libertad and Méndez Núñez engaged Baleares. The cruiser was damaged by several hits from Libertad in critical areas and a fire in the ammunition storeroom, but she limped away successfully. Two Republican freighters changed course to the south during the engagement and ran aground near Cape Cherchell. One of them was lost while the other was salvaged and interned by French authorities. In March 1938, Baleares—along with fellow Nationalist cruisers and —engaged the Republican cruisers Libertad and Méndez Núñez, accompanied by five destroyers, off Cartagena, in the Battle of Cape Palos. At around 02:15 am on 6 March, the Nationalist and Republican cruisers engaged in an ineffective gunnery duel. During this gunnery duel, the Republican destroyers , , and all fired their torpedoes. Two or three torpedoes from Lepanto hit Baleares between \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" turrets, detonating her forward magazine and sinking her. Out of her crew of 1,206, she had 765 seamen killed or missing, among them Vice-Admiral Manuel Vierna Belando, commander of the cruiser division.

The original map probably dated from the early 1560s, but it survives only in later and slightly modified copies. It was printed from woodcut blocks on eight sheets, and in its present state measures approximately high by wide. (There has been some damage to the blocks, and it was probably originally fractionally larger.)Marks 1964, p. 15. The Woodcut map is a slightly smaller-scale, cruder and lightly modified copy of the so- called \\"Copperplate\\" map, surveyed between 1553 and 1559, which, however, survives only in part. It also bears a close relationship to the map of London included in Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg's Civitates Orbis Terrarum, published in Cologne and Amsterdam in 1572, although this is on a greatly reduced scale.Reproduced in Prockter, Taylor and Fisher 1979, p. 32. The Woodcut map was traditionally attributed to the surveyor and cartographer Ralph Agas, but this attribution is now considered to be erroneous. Impressions Three impressions of the Woodcut map survive in its earliest known state of c.1633. They are held in London Metropolitan Archives, the Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and The National Archives at Kew. Date and creation Detail from the map showing Gray's Inn The three early copies of the map are dated by an inscription to c.1633.Marks 1964, pp. 14, 25 n. 13. The inscription does not include an explicit date, but dates the foundation of London to 1130 BC, and gives the city's present age as 2763 years. However, it is evident that the map in this form has been updated from an earlier state. The royal arms in the upper left corner are those of the House of Stuart (1603–49), but are clearly an insertion, almost certainly replacing the earlier Tudor arms, which do appear (at a very small scale) on the royal barge, pictured on the Thames. Similarly, the Royal Exchange (erected 1566–70; opened 1571) appears on the map, but is again clearly an insertion. The map is now known to be a close – though slightly less detailed – copy of the \\"Copperplate\\" map, surveyed between 1553 and 1559; but one difference between the two maps is that St Paul's Cathedral appears on the Woodcut version without its spire. The spire was lost in a fire in 1561, and so the map cannot be earlier than that date. The Woodcut map is therefore now dated with a reasonable degree of probability to the 1560s. A reference in the Stationers' Register for 1562–3 to the \\"Carde of London\\" may possibly refer to it.Stephen Powys Marks, \\"Dating the Copperplate Map and its first derivatives\\", in Saunders and Schofield 2001, pp. 7–15. The map has also been slightly modified from the Copperplate map by the introduction of a higher degree of perspective to the projection: this is particularly obvious in the northern and western areas (beyond Bishopsgate towards Shoreditch, and in the Westminster and Whitehall area). It is therefore closer to a bird's-eye view of the City, seen from an imaginary viewpoint above the south bank of the Thames, as opposed to the \\"bird's-flight view\\" projection of the Copperplate map. Stephen Powys Marks suggests that this adjustment \\"may be an indication of an appeal to a less sophisticated public than that which would buy the fine copper engraving\\".Marks 1964, pp. 17–18, and plate IIIb. Attribution to Agas The Woodcut map was traditionally attributed to the surveyor and cartographer Ralph Agas (c.1540–1621). This attribution has its roots in a claim made by Agas in 1588 to the effect that for ten years past he had been hoping to undertake a survey of London. On the basis of this statement, the late 17th-century engraver of a copy of the map on pewter sheets associated Agas's name with it; and the attribution was then asserted more firmly by the antiquary George Vertue in 1737–8.Marks 1964, pp. 21–2. However, the probable date of the Woodcut map and its relationship to the Copperplate map make it extremely unlikely that Agas – who began practising as a surveyor in about 1566 – played any part in its creation, and the attribution is now treated as highly dubious. Nevertheless, the map is still often referred to as the \\"Agas\\" map. Reproductions Reproductions of the map have been published on several occasions in modern times. An edition based on the \\"pewter\\" copy was published by Taperell & Innes in 1849. A facsimile of the Woodcut map was published in 1874, with an introduction by W. H. Overall. The map was printed in large- format atlas form in 1979 by the London Topographical Society (in association with Harry Margary and Guildhall Library) as The A to Z of Elizabethan London, overprinted with street names and a basic grid, and with introductory notes by John Fisher and a comprehensive index.Prockter, Taylor and Fisher 1979.

The film portrays a surrealist world that Felicien, the protagonist played by Didier Bourdon, must navigate through as he seeks to learn what has become of his deceased father’s fortune. Described as \\"an elaborate Dadaist joke\\" by The New York Times, Ruiz’s film was intended to emulate a Monty Python-esque humor with deadpan comedic tone.Holden, Stephen (20 August 1993) Review/Film; Of Miracles and Visions In the Realm of the Everyday, nytimes.com.

Retrieved 1 March 2017. right Plot After World War I, the French doctor Felicien travels to a small town in Portugal to visit a factory his father invested his fortune in prior to his death. Upon his arrival in the town with fields of crutches protruding from the ground, Felicien finds the area to be a surreal dream world where visions and miracles are such ordinary occurrences they become a nuisance. The dogs of the town are sacred animals and the people of the town are the sleep walking undead. Felicien finds his way to a mansion where Anthony, the wealthy owner of the factory that produces prosthetic limbs, resides with his wife Ines. After sitting through a very bizarre dinner with the residents of the mansion Felicien has an equally strange dream involving the couple. While exploring the town Felicien meets a priest buried in the ground by Ellis, an artist who uses corpses to make living paintings and who looks identical to one of Felicien’s psychiatric patients. The priest is exhausted by the endless miracles, as it is his job to excommunicate people for performing miracles not authorized by the church. Felicien continues to have strange encounters that blur the lines between illusion and the real, including conversations with Le Marquis, who inhabits the same body as Anthony, and the Virgin Mary who mimics and mocks Felicien when she appears before him. He also meets a young boy who performs miracles and helps Felicien out when he can’t find a bathroom and needs to urinate. One of Felicien’s more unusual encounters is with a giant sculpture of a finger made from marble that crashes through the ceiling of the guest room of the mansion, nearly crushing him. Felicien explores Anthony’s mansion to find a basement laboratory where disturbing experiments are performed. Felicien learns that doubles of Anthony and Ines were created in the lab when their souls left their bodies one night. The couple’s souls wander and sometimes occupy the body of Le Marquis. Towards the end of the film Felicien visits the laboratory again and gets thrown out of the lab where he finds himself stuck levitating in the air against his will. The miracle performing boy attempts to help him get back on the ground, but must first get permission to perform the miracle. In the meantime the priest lassoes a rope around Felicien and leads him around. Eventually the miracle boy is able to help him down to the ground. Felicien rushes back to the laboratory when he hears Le Marquis is dying to wish him farewell. Felicien finally leaves the strange town, floating away as he walks towards the sky.

The role of the parish priest was also recast prior to filming. The role was originally intended for Jean-Francois Stevenin, but due to scheduling conflicts the role was rewritten for Daniel Prevost. Filming Dark at Noon was the first film Ruiz made with panoramic framing. The film was shot on an Arri 535 camera with a very sensitive film stock, as opposed to previously shooting on 16 mm film.

It is usually made out of Aida cloth or linen, sewn from two square sheets of cloth (forming the top and bottom of the cushion) in such a way that each corner of one square is hemmed to the middle of a side of the opposite square. Embroidery, hardanger, and/or cross-stitch are used to decorate the top and bottom of the cushion. A button is typically secured in the center of the cushion to give a small depression on the top. Beads, tassels and other objects can decorate the biscornu. They are typically able to fit in the palm of your hand. The name is derived from the French adjective, biscornu, meaning skewed, quirky or irregular. Mathematically, two squares joined together in the pattern of a biscornu will form the boundary of a unique convex polyhedron, by Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem.. In the case of a biscornu, this polyhedron is a flattened square antiprism, with ten faces: two smaller squares (diagonally inset into the squares from which the shape is formed) and eight isosceles right triangles (the corners of its original squares) around the sides.

The battle saw the Eastern Transvaal Boer commandos of Generals Grobler, Brits, Viljoen and Louis Botha attack the rear guard of Colonel Benson's much feared No. 3 Flying Column while it was in marching formation to its base camp. Battle Lieutenant Colonel George Elliott Benson's British No. 3 flying column, comprising 2000 men, specialised in night raids that were terrorising Boer Commandos on the highveld, it had become so successful that General Botha ordered all available Boer forces to accumulate at Bakenlaagte so as to attack Benson. The No. 3 Flying Column was marching back to a refit station after performing farm clearing operations. Rainy and misty weather had reduced visibility and made the going difficult which caused the marching British column to become spread out into clusters of troops. The column force became further extended when Benson began to deploy small detachments of mounted men and infantry to suppress small Boer sniping teams that were roaming around the marching column. General Botha arrived with about 800 reinforcements after riding about without stopping, on arrival, Botha observed that the strung out column provided an ideal opportunity for an overwhelming force to roll up the isolated and spread out groups of commonwealth troops piecemeal and immediately ordered a large Boer force of mounted men to attack the small isolated rear guard of the column. Outnumbered four to one, the Columns rear guard of 210 Commonwealth troops set up a defensive position on Gun Hill and fought about 900 Boers in a close quarter twenty minute gun fight that ended only when the column rear guard was annihilated. Great bravery was demonstrated by the men on both sides with combined casualties numbering approximately 87 killed with 182 wounded. Colonel Benson (a veteran of the Battle of Magersfontein, 11 December 1899) was to die the next morning from wounds received on the field of battle. This rear-guard action allowed the main column time to deploy and set up a defensive perimeter under Lt Colonel Wools-Sampson. This deployment prevented the attacking Boer forces from riding on and capturing the main column as originally planned. The Boers left the field with what ever spoils they could carry and the British carried in the wounded to the entrenched camp during the night. The Bakenlaagte battlefield is located on the Kriel-Kinross road at the intersection of the R547 and R580 roads in Mpumalanga Province, just south of Matla Power Station. The 73 dead Commonwealth troops were buried on Gun Hill but later reinterred in Primrose Cemetery, Corner of Cemetery road and Beaconsfield road, Germiston in the 1960s.

Much of the land was converted into grazing fields for large livestock or used to build homes and communities. Many of the landholders opted to pay off the estates' owners to take over complete ownership. Schools The main elementary school for Bonne Aventure is the Bonne Aventure Presbyterian School, located on School Trace off the main Bonne Aventure Rd. The nearest high schools are Williamsville Secondary School, Gasparillo Secondary School (formally Gasparillo Composite School) and Marabella Secondary School. Ethnicity and Religion The village has a cosmopolitan mix of residents but is composed mainly of the 2 major groups in Trinidad: people of Indian and African descent. Religious adherents include Hindus, Presbyterians, Muslims and Catholics. Consequently, one can find numerous religious establishments throughout the village; Muslim mosques, Hindu temples and Christian churches of multiple denominations. Geography Bonne Aventure is low-lying and is just upstream from the Guaracara River. The Bonne Aventure main road runs South West to North East from the Gasparillo overpass to Cotton Hill. Climate Bonne Aventure has a lowland seasonal tropical climate with a wet season lasting from June to November and a dry season lasting from January to May. Unlike Port of Spain, Bonne Aventure has a usually hot and sweltering climate year round, with an exception for the wet season. Infrastructure Utilities  Electric generation is handled by Powergen, while electrical distribution is handled by the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&TEC;). Bonne Adventure does not contain its own power generation facilities. Harmony Hall T&TEC; Substation is used to regulate voltage for the Bonne Aventure. Water and sewerage are under the purview of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (WASA).

Made by Michael Balcon at Ealing Studios, it is based on the 1946 play of the same title by Ronald Millar who co-wrote the screenplay with Angus MacPhail. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Jim Morahan and Michael Relph. Synopsis Frieda (Mai Zetterling) is a German woman who helps English airman Robert (David Farrar) to escape from a German prisoner-of-war camp as the Second World War nears its end. She loves him; he is only grateful to her. In a church between the Russian-German lines, however, Robert marries her, so that she can obtain a British passport. Together they eventually arrive in his Oxfordshire home. Frieda meets his family: his mother, his small stepbrother Tony, Judy (Glynis Johns), the attractive widow of Robert's brother, and Aunt Eleanor (Flora Robson), a figure in local politics and vehemently anti-German. At first, the townspeople are bitterly hostile to Frieda, and Robert is forced to give up his job as a schoolteacher. Gradually, however, the ill will subsides, and she is accepted, except by Eleanor. Frieda is befriended by Judy, who, unknown to Robert, is now also in love with him. As Robert settles into a new life, working with Frieda on a farm, he begins to lose his prisoner-of-war heaviness. He sees Frieda in a new light. But then they see a film dealing with the horror of Bergen-Belsen and Frieda fears their marriage will not survive its revelation of her countrymen's cruelty. But Robert clings on to what they have established between them. Suddenly, an ex-German soldier appears—Frieda's brother Richard (Albert Lieven). Thinking he had been killed, Frieda is initially overjoyed. He had been captured and allowed to volunteer for the Polish Army. However, she soon realises that he has remained a Nazi at heart, his wedding present to Frieda being a swastika on a chain. In a pub, he is denounced as one of the guards at a concentration camp. To Robert, in private, he admits the truth of this accusation, and claims that Frieda had known and approved of his actions. They fight, and Robert now revolts against everything German as vile and polluted. Frieda, fearing that she has lost Robert, attempts suicide, but, just in time, Robert reaches her and the shock brings him to a realisation of what he risked losing. He perceives that his faith in her was justified. Even Aunt Eleanor comes to believe that her sweeping anti-German prejudice was wrong: \\"You cannot treat human beings as though they were less than human—without becoming less than human yourself.\\"Daily Mail Film Award Annual 1948 Cast *David Farrar as Robert * Glynis Johns as Judy * Mai Zetterling as Frieda * Flora Robson as Nell * Albert Lieven as Richard * Barbara Everest as Mrs Dawson * Gladys Henson as Edith * Ray Jackson as Tony * Patrick Holt as Alan * Milton Rosmer as Merrick * Barry Letts as Jim Merrick * Gilbert Davis as Lawrence * Renee Gadd as Mrs. Freeman * Douglas Jefferies as Hobson * Barry Jones as Holliday * Eliot Makeham as Bailey * Norman Pierce as Crawley * John Ruddock as Granger * D.A.

Aurora has been established for 20+ years and their headquarters is at the Manassas Regional Airport in Manassas, Virginia.  History  In 1989, the company was founded in Alexandria, Virginia, as a follow on to the MIT Daedalus project. In 1991, its first aircraft was the Perseus proof of concept (POC) built for NASA which first flew at NASA Dryden. It was followed by two Perseus As and one Perseus B which were all built for the NASA ERAST Program. A twin engine Theseus was also built. In 1995, Aurora joined the Global Hawk team and continues to build composite fuselage components and tail assemblies of the RQ-4 for Northrop Grumman and the USAF. In 2002, a demonstration aircraft was flown from an altitude of 100,000 feet to simulate the low density of the martian atmosphere. Aurora has been involved in several NASA programs studying how to fly an aircraft on the planet Mars. In 2008, the DARPA Vulture aimed for an UAV that could stay aloft for at least five years in the stratosphere, carrying a payload: Aurora proposed three drones taking off separately then joining up in flight, to form an efficient flat wing at night, and folding into a Z for the best solar energy collection in daylight. In 2009, as Aurora has developed its own line of small vertical take-off UAVs known as the Aurora Goldeneye, the third variant of this family, the GoldenEye-80, was first flown publicly at Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International's Unmanned Systems North America trade show. On 5 October 2017, Boeing announced that it would be acquiring Aurora Flight Sciences. In April 2018, as DARPA allowed Aurora to transition government-funded technology for commercial applications, the tilt-wing XV-24A Lightning Strike and its distributed propulsion could be reused for an electric commercial air taxi along its lift-and-cruise prototype with vertical flight rotors and cruise fixed propellers, unveiled in 2017. Aurora plans multiple demonstrators controlled centrally by 2020 and a piloted air taxi by 2023 with autonomy later depending on regulation. In spring 2019, Aurora plans to fly a High-Altitude Long Endurance drone powered by solar cells and batteries, Odysseus.  Facilities  Aurora has four facilities that each have their own focus. Corporate Headquarters and Engineering are in Manassas, Virginia. A manufacturing center was opened in Fairmont, West Virginia in 1994, being moved to Bridgeport, West Virginia in 2000. Another manufacturing facility was opened in Starkville, Mississippi in 2005 before being moved to the nearby Golden Triangle Regional Airport in Columbus, Mississippi in 2007. A research and development center was opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2005 where Aurora now develops a line of micro air vehicles.

He played an important role in the establishment of an Elizabethan research centre in Aix-en-Provence and contributed to the Golden Guides series a volume on wines. He was also responsible for the libretto in Darius Milhaud's L'opéra du gueux, Op. 171 (1937), a ballad opera in three acts. In 1966 his Laurence Sterne: From Tristram to Yorick, originally in French, won the Scott Moncrieff Prize for its translation by Barbara Bray. Fluchère's nephew Henri André Fluchère (1914 - 1990) was the author of the Golden Guide to Wines, and illustrated other Golden Guides. He was an illustrator of science and other technical textbooks, and wrote books on art, especially watercolor. He was a registered heraldic illustrator with various museums in New York City. He immigrated to the USA in 1925. He enlisted in the US Army before World War II in Military Intelligence as an Interpreter (French) as a Master Sergeant with the 28th Infantry Division. After the 28th Infantry Division crossed the Rhine River into Germany, his services were no longer needed and he was reassigned to The Stars and Stripes Newspaper in Paris as an illustrator and artist. After returning from World War II, he worked for Superman Magazine as an illustrator. In the 1950s he was Art Director for McGraw Hill in their textbook division. In the late 1950s he established Art Tech Services, in Irvington, NY where he lived and raised his family. References * Fluchère, Henri. \\"Défense de la Lucidité.\\" In T. S.

An autodidact and polyglot who failed his university entrance examinations, Ts'ao went on to become the preeminent Taiwanese expert on the Dutch and Spanish colonial eras in Taiwan. Early life Ts'ao was born in modern-day Taipei City's Shilin District in 1920, to a family that had produced several generations of educators. In 1939 he graduated from Taihoku Prefecture Second Junior High School, but failed his university entrance exams. Undaunted, he sought out Iwao Seiichi of Taihoku Imperial University, who had spent time in England and the Netherlands learning the languages. Iwao taught Ts'ao Dutch, which was essential for Ts'ao to read the archived material from the Dutch Formosa era. In 1947, hired Ts'ao as a librarian at the university. The position gave Ts'ao access to a huge range of materials he would otherwise have been unable to see. Academic career Ts'ao studied a number of languages in pursuit of his understanding of early Taiwanese history, meaning he could make use of ten languages: Taiwanese, Japanese, English, German, Mandarin Chinese, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin. The long-running historical journal, the Taiwan Bank Periodical () was masterminded by Ts'ao, while he was also heavily involved in the monumental series of Chinese source material on Taiwan and Fujian history, the Taiwan Documents Collection (). Ts'ao retired from National Taiwan University in 1985. Over the course of his life, Ts'ao assembled a 20,000 volume library, classed as one of the finest collections on the Dutch East India Company in the world.

It lies on the A417 road 2.5 miles (4 km) northwest of Gloucester, on the west bank of the River Severn. In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 488,ONS Census 2001 reducing to 458 at the 2011 census. The parish includes the hamlet of Overton, north west of the village.  Geography  Maisemore Bridge connects the village to Alney Island, and provides a viewpoint for the Severn bore. Maisemore Weir and Lock were built in about 1870.Victoria County History of Gloucestershire: Gloucester Quays and Docks The weir is at the upper limit of the tides on the Severn. The lock is no longer in use. The area is prone to flooding, which from time to time closes the A417 between Maisemore and Gloucester, especially in the spring when the swollen River Severn meets high tides coming up the estuary.  History  The name of the village appears to be of Welsh origin, meaning \\"great field\\" ().Mills, A.D. and Room, A, A Dictionary of British Place-Names Oxford University Press The northern part of Alney Island, which is within the parish of Maisemore, is known as Maisemore Ham, combining Welsh and Old English words for field or meadow (ham, meaning \\"meadow\\"Oxford English Dictionary). The village was originally around the church. Probably in the 14th century, the present linear village was replanned further south, leaving the church separated from its settlement.  Notable buildings  The parish church, dedicated to St Giles, is a Grade II* listed building, dating from the 15th century.Maisemore, St Giles - a church near you Maisemore Court, near the church, is a former manor house, also a Grade II* listed building. Maisemore Bridge Maisemore Bridge The construction of the current bridge was commenced in 1939 but was stopped during the war of 1939-45. It was completed in 1956. The bridge stands on or near the site of at least six previous bridges. The first recorded one had a cross with an inscription stating it was begun by William Fitz Anketil circa A.D. 1230. The next known bridge was recorded as \\"cut down\\" by royalist besiegers of Gloucester in 1643 which suggests it might have been a wooden structure: It is known to have been rebuilt of timber. The parishioners of Maisemore were, by ancient custom, liable for the repair of the bridge, but this apparently proved beyond their means as in 1709, they were fined £200 for non-repair. At the same time the County Justices voted £200 towards \\"a good substantial brick and stone bridge\\". The latter as destroyed by great floods and in 1777, trustees were established by act of parliament to build a new bridge in place of a temporary wooden one which had been built lower down the river. A new two-arch brick bridge was begun in 1785 by Thomas Badford, the cost being defrayed by tolls levied by the trustees until 1795. The trustees continued to maintain the bridge until 1936, when by agreement their powers were ceded to the Gloucester County Council. This bridge was demolished in 1939 to make way for the present structure and a temporary timber bridge was erected which carried the traffic from 1939 to 1956.

The document is issued by the police on behalf of the Ministry of Interior and is the main form of identification on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria. All Bulgarians are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they not. Since 1 January 2007, the Bulgarian identity card can be used for travel within the European Union, the Schengen Area and the United Kingdom instead of a Bulgarian passport. In addition, the Bulgarian identity card is accepted as a travel document by European microstates, the French overseas territories, Montserrat (max. 14 days), Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia,http://migration.commission.ge/files/visa-free_countries_rsm.pdf Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Cyprus,http://mfa.gov.ct.tr/consular- info/visa-regulations/ North Macedonia, and Serbia. History The Bulgarian identity card (лична карта in the Cyrillic alphabet, or \\"lichna karta\\" in the Latin transliteration of Bulgarian) is first issued and is compulsory after turning 14 years of age. The new Bulgarian ID cards were introduced in 1999. They follow the general pattern in the EU and replaced the old, Soviet-style \\"internal passports\\", also known as \\"green passports\\". Since 29 March 2010 Bulgaria to Start Issuing Biometric IDs in March 2010 new Bulgarian identity cards were introduced. Physical appearance The physical appearance of the Bulgarian identity card is similar to that of a credit card, the identity card is plastic and rounded-rectangular in shape. On the left side is the photograph of the bearer. On the top edge of the card, the name Republic of Bulgaria is available in two languages, Bulgarian and English, written in capital letters, below, the name of the card is available in the same two languages and also written in capital letters. The middle part of the flag of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Bulgaria are also displayed on the identity card. Furthermore, the following information is contained on the front side of the card: * The unique 9-digit ID number of the card * The cardholder's full name, sex, and date of birth * The cardholder's uniform civil number (Bulgarian: единен граждански номер; abbreviated ЕГН, EGN): a unique 10-digit number that serves as national identification number * Date of expiry of the card * Cardholder's signature The back side of the identity card contains the cardholder's family name, place of birth, permanent address, height, and eye colour, as well as the place where the card was issued together with the date of issue. At the bottom there is a machine- readable zone according to ICAO specifications. Obtaining an identity card In order to be issued an identity card, one needs to fill in a form, which should be taken to the Identity Documents and Passport Regime Units within the District Police Stations. The forms could be obtained at all District Police Stations. When applying a digital picture of the person is taken, and—in the case of applying for a passport at the same time—fingerprints of the thumbs of the applicant. First-time applicants (i.e. persons turning 14) must also provide a valid birth certificate. It is possible for a person to apply for a renewal of the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant changes in his or her appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an authorized representative may receive your ID. This does not apply to applying for passports, as fingerprints must be taken. A monetary tax is paid for the issuing of the identity card; the price depends on the selected type of issuing which is basically the time needed for the card to be issued (the prices are listed in District Police Stations). The standard time for issuing a Bulgarian identity card is 30 days. There are, however, express services that allow you to apply for a 7-day or even 24-hour service. These cost extra (twice for the 7-day and quadruple for the 24-hour service). If you apply for a standard 30-day service there is a great chance your Id card will be ready way before that. The Ministry of Interior has provided an online service that allows you to check whether your ID card is ready. For people ages 14 to 18 years, the identity cards are valid for four years, while citizens ages 18–58 are issued cards with 10-year validity; citizens over 58 years old are issued identity cards with no expiration date. Identity card validity check Anyone can examine the validity of Bulgarian identity cards on the website of the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior here; there's also a service by the Ministry of the Interior that can be used to see if an identity card is ready to be picked up (in Bulgarian). The services are free and only card number and birth date need to be given.

Plot summary Judy Peabody (Betty Hutton) is a hat-check girl at New York's popular Stork Club nightclub. Her dreams are for her bandleader boyfriend Danny (Don DeFore) to return home from the Marines, and to sing with his band. While sunbathing on a dock, Judy saves an elderly man (Barry Fitzgerald) from drowning. She assumes from his disheveled appearance and folksy demeanor that he is poor, and calls him \\"Pop\\". She gives him her name and tells him where she works, and encourages him to contact her if he ever needs help again. Unbeknownst to her, the man is the wealthy Jerry Bates, whom his lawyer Curtis (Robert Benchley) refers to as \\"J.B.\\" Bates instructs Curtis to anonymously reward Judy with everything her heart desires. Curtis sends a letter to Judy at the Stork Club, informing her she now has a new luxury apartment, and a line of credit at a prestigious department store, with no strings attached. Bates, donning shabby clothes to conceal his wealth, visits Judy at the club. Assuming he is unemployed, she convinces the maitre d' to hire him as a busboy, a position Bates quickly sabotages. Bates returns to the club to see Judy receive the letter. She promptly goes on a shopping spree, buying dresses and furs without knowing her benefactor's identity. Assuming Bates is homeless, Judy offers him a room in her new apartment—and Bates, who has formed a fatherly attachment to her, and whose wife has recently left him, accepts. Danny arrives home with plans to form a new band of top-flight musicians. He is excited to see Judy, until he sees her luxurious apartment and clothes and suspects she has become a \\"kept woman\\" in his absence. When he sees Bates at Judy's apartment, he believes his suspicions have been confirmed and breaks up with her. Danny finds out Judy has rented the other apartment on her floor for his band, he becomes cool to her. Judy continues to invest in Danny's band by buying new clothes for them using Bates' money. Bates is upset and wants to reign in her spending and asks his lawyer Curtis to tell her who he is. Curtis refuses, but Bates catches Curtis in the hallway to tell Curtis he works for him. Curtis begins to tell him he won't lose much, about $200,000 to $300,000, and not to mention the Gift Tax of 30% of any gift over $3,000. Bates replies, \\"Coolidge. Oh, for a Coolidge\\" harking back to days of the Roaring Twenties when President Calvin Coolidge cut both taxes and federal spending to boost America's economy. Danny meets with an agent but has trouble finding work for his new band. Judy phones Sherman Billingsley (Bill Goodwin), the Stork Club's powerful but generous owner, and posing as gossip columnist Walter Winchell, tells him about a fantastic new band he must hear. Billingsley arrives at the apartment, where Danny's tuxedoed band and Judy perform brilliantly for him. Billingsley offers them a job at the club, then tells Judy: \\"By the way, I'd know your voice anywhere—and I was having lunch with Winchell when you called.\\" When Judy meets Bates's estranged wife, she finally learns that Bates is responsible for her new riches. Seeking to return his kindness, she engineers a reconciliation between them. Meanwhile, Danny confronts Curtis and learns the truth about Judy's benefactor. Realizing she has been true to him, Danny apologizes to her—on the bandstand, during a song—and they are reunited.

Different states have held the tradition even till date, and Rajasthan is one among them. Jaipur Tamasha, a unique musical folk play, is a 19th- century contribution by Jaipur city in Indian state of Rajasthan to the folk theatre of Rajasthan. At the outset of the 18th century, in the peripherals of Agra, between two groups originated and developed a poetic dialogue. This later on came to be known as ‘Khayal-Tamasha’ during the reign of Aurangzeb, When musicians lost their patronage, they started looking for alternative environments to carry out their art and music. the contemporary emperor of Jaipur, Maharaja Sawai Jaisingh brought a few artists to Jaipur and settled them in Brahmpuri. The foremost among them was the Bhatt Family of Jaipur. Here in under the proximity of the chief of the Bhatt family, Shri Banshidhar Bhatt, Tamasha style developed a specific form. This was a musical based folk dramatic form, which had an explicit composition of music acting and dance. The Tamasha form with its music comprising classical, semi classical and folk melody, replete with acting and dancing is being performed from the last 250 years in the open theatre called ‘Akhara’ at Brahampuri in Jaipur with a unique style of presentation. It is performed mainly on the day's surrounding the festival Holi, on the days of Holi on the following Amaveasya and on Ramnavmi. Similar to the ‘Aagan Theatre’ The entire performance takes place under the open air and the audience sits in a circle with the stage in the middle. the Tamasha actors perform in the center with the singers, performers and musicians accompanied by their instruments. the Tamasha begins with a ‘Lahariya’ there begins a special dancing performance upon a contemporary rhythm which moves from show to fast and reaches its perfection. thumb The foundation of the narrative of Tamasha is solidarity, love and religious co- existence (secularism) as the Sanskrit plays conclude with a ‘Bharat Vakya’ Tamasha too, at the end of its plot concludes with a happy ending, the fulfilling of the wishes of the protagonist and wishing for the welfare of all. In the Tamasha, the main ragas which are used are ‘Bhupali’ 'Sarang' ‘Aasawari’ (Komal ishbh) \\"Jonpuri’ ‘Malkauns’ ‘Darbari’ ‘Bihag’ ‘Sindh Kafi’ ‘ Bhairvi’ ‘Kalingda’ and ‘Kedar’ etc. The accompanying instruments are Harmoniyam, Tabla, Sarangi, and Ghugroo. The costumes are very important to the identity of Tamasha. The Tamasha (Crest) \\"kalangi’ (plume) Gotedar Bhagwavastra ( laced saffron garments), a singi and seli (a sheat fish and a neck ornament) to give beats are among the chief costumes of the performance of Tamasha.. The Tamasha actors also give an imagined description of the costumes of the performance to which the audience believes similarly the part of the female characters is and the audience enjoys suspending their disbelief. The creative texts used in tamasha are chiefly ‘Tamasha Gopichand’ ‘ Tamasha Ranjah heer’ ‘Tamasha Jogi Jogan’ ‘Roopchand Gandhi’ ‘ Jutthan Miyan’ ‘Chaila Panihari’, etc. The Jaipur Tamasha has become very famous folk tradition in North India. Performance by Dr Saurabh Bhatt And Dilip Bhatt This folk art originally took place as poetic dialogues between two groups of poets. These poets received special attention in the royal court of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh. Bhatt family was one of the lucky poetic family that received acknowledgment for the art. Under this clan, the poetic expressions developed into several new and distinct forms of art. Even today poetry is one of the main forms of Tamasha. However, it now greatly accompanies by singing, acting, and dancing. Since then the Tamasha folk art of Jaipur has become popular, and it continues to attract tourists even till date. The musical tamasha has managed to survive and entertain audiences even in the modern world. Even though the art form has existed for more than 250 years with the core elements remaining the same, it has received some influence from the contemporary world, as well. This mainly reflects in the storyline and there are even references of actual events of the present times. It might include anything from recent scandals in politics to developments in sports or technology. Therefore, this form of art is still popular, and they are used in movies and theatres, as well.

He graduated B.A. 1771, M.A. 1774, D.D. 1780. After taking his degree he resided for some time at Eton as private tutor to the Earl of Guilford, holding at the same time the vicarage of Bexley in Kent, while a few years later he succeeded to the mastership of Sherburn Hospital, which his father obtained leave to resign in his favour. In 1782 he was promoted to the deanery of Rochester, and in 1802 to the bishopric of that diocese. As bishop of Rochester he proposed an address from the clergy thanking the crown for requiring an undertaking from the ministry not to move in the matter of Catholic emancipation. The bishopric of Rochester was a poor one, and it was in his case, for the first time for some years past, separated from the deanery of Westminster. Dampier therefore looked for fresh promotion, and in 1808 was translated to Ely. He died suddenly on the evening of 13 May 1812 at Ely House in London. Dampier published several sermons. He was known for his love of literature, and for the library and collection of prints which he accumulated throughout his life. He left a bibliophile's account in Latin, the manuscript of which was extensively used by Thomas Frognall Dibdin in compiling his Aedes Althorpianae. His library was sold by his half-brother (lawyer Sir Henry) and widow to the Duke of Devonshire at a valuation amounting to nearly £10,000.

Expanding across the country, Fruehauf had 16 plants and over 80 distributorships for parts and service. Globally, the company expanded into Europe, South America and Asia. Following a proxy battle in the late 1980s the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997. International divisions became independent, U.S. subsidiaries like Kelsey Hayes, Pro-Par, Budd Wheels and Hobbs were sold; Wabash National acquired the crippled company in 1997. History The company's founder, August Charles Fruehauf (1868–1930), was born in Fraser, Michigan, the son of Charles and Sophia Fruehauf.The Fruehauf surname is German in origin, originally spelled \\"Frühauf\\", meaning \\"early riser\\". He began his career as a Detroit-area blacksmith and carriage builder. In 1914, a local businessman named Frederic M. Sibley asked Fruehauf to build a trailer which could be towed behind a Ford Model T and transport a boat to upper Michigan. Fruehauf successfully built the device, and Sibley requested he build additional trailers for use on his lumber yard. Fruehauf would call them \\"semi-trailers\\", and his product proved popular. In 1918, he incorporated his business as the Fruehauf Trailer Company. The semi-trailers soon demonstrated their practicality and orders came in from competing lumber dealers and any manufacturer who wanted to expand their customer base. Closed van trailers were designed and put into service. Industries like dairy and fuel oil were revolutionized with this \\"go-anywhere\\" type of transportation. Capitalizing on August Fruehauf's slogan, \\"a horse can pull more than it can carry, so can a truck\\", the company continued to grow. The St. Louis plant Fruehauf developed semi-trailers for use in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Developing over 150 patents for military products alone, these were eventually introduced into commercial use. Among them were early versions of the shipping container used on some U.S. railroads and, after 1956, on the ships of Pan- Atlantic Steamship Co., the ship line controlled by container pioneer Malcom McLean and later known as Sea-Land. Fruehauf contributed to the creation of the American Trucking Association and were instrumental in the creation of the interstate highway system as advisors to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Fruehauf purchased competing companies to acquire distribution, new technology or geographic advantages. Warner-Fruehauf in Baltimore, Hobbs from Texas, and Strick in the Midwest. On February 28, 1947, the Fruehauf Corporation purchased the Carter Manufacturing Company. Carter was started in 1927 and based in Memphis, Tennessee, with another location in Birmingham, Alabama. The Carter Manufacturing Company was involved in the manufacturing of trailers from the Carter plant. As with Warner-Fruehauf in Baltimore, all trailers made out of the Memphis and Birmingham plants were called Fruehauf-Carter. Fruehauf designed and built trailers, launchers and GHE for ICBM, IRBM, and tactical ballistic missiles of various types During the U.S. guided missile boom in the 1950s and 1960s, Fruehauf developed and manufactured missile vehicles, ground- based and submarine-based missile launchers, transporters/erectors, shipping containers, ground handling equipment, equipment shelters, and other components for the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force. This included systems for the Atlas, Bomarc, Corporal, Falcon, Genie, Hawk, Matador, Nike Ajax & Nike Hercules, Jupiter, Polaris, Redstone, Regulus I & II, Sergeant, Thor, and Titan missiles. To meet increasing defense contract work, the hub of the company's ground handling/ground support equipment (GHE/GSE) production was placed at its plant in Delphos, Ohio. The company also provided the Army with fuel tank semi-trailers and 12-ton semi-trailers. At its plant in Fullerton, California (previously owned by Hanson Bros.) it manufactured 15-ton amphibious lighters and reusable metal shipping boxes for military purposes. Both Detroit and Fullerton branches of the company's Military Products Division took part in the U.S. space program, producing among the other things Gemini practice recovery spacecraft. In 1959, the company, Roy Fruehauf, Teamsters Union President Dave Beck, and others were indicted on charges that the company had illegally lent $200,000 to Beck in 1954. The Teamsters had previously lent $1.5 million to Roy Fruehauf to finance a proxy fight against his elder brother, Harvey, and Roy Fruehauf was alleged to have returned the favor by making the loan to Beck. As the Teamsters represented some Fruehauf employees, the loan was alleged to be an illegal gift or bribe, in violation of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the indictment in 1961,United States v. Fruehauf, 365 U.S. 146 (1961). but the case was subsequently dismissed. Following the death of August's sons, Harvey, Harry and Roy Fruehauf, the Fruehauf family was no longer in charge by the mid-1960s. Resting on the laurels of the preceding decades, management would not make the tough and difficult personal sacrifices needed to withstand economic challenges. While the company eventually diversified and expanded its operations, financial issues resulted in the sell-off of company divisions in 1989. The truck trailer unit continued operation as Fruehauf Trailer Corporation. In the 1970s and 1980s, Fruehauf became a major manufacturer of aluminum or steel marine Intermodal containers for Container ships, both in the US as well as through various overseas subsidiaries such as Fruehauf France or Nippon Fruehauf, with major global shipping lines and container leasing companies as customers. The company declared bankruptcy on October 7, 1996. An axle plant in Ohio was sold to Holland Hitch Company on February 18, 1997, and Fruehauf's United States manufacturing and sales business was sold to Wabash National on March 17, 1997. Prior to the bankruptcy, the Bellinger Shipyard owned by Fruehauf in Jacksonville, Florida, was sold to M. D. Moody & Sons, Inc. for $1.9 million in 1995 and then the Jacksonville Shipyard was sold to developers in 2014. Companies in France, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan continued to operate under the Fruehauf name. In 2015, Poland's largest trailer company, Wielton, purchased a 65% share of Fruehauf France; it completed the purchase of the balance in 2017.

He served as Bishop of Little Rock from 1907 until his death in 1946. Biography John Morris was born in Hendersonville, Tennessee, to John and Anne (née Morrissey) Morris, who were Irish immigrants. After graduating from St. Mary's College in Lebanon, Kentucky, he began his studies for the priesthood in 1887 at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. While in Rome, he was ordained a priest by Cardinal Lucido Parocchi on June 11, 1892. Morris, following his return to Tennessee, was named rector of St. Mary's Cathedral in Nashville and private secretary to Bishop Thomas Sebastian Byrne. In 1901 he became vicar general of the Diocese of Nashville. He was later raised to the rank of a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness in 1905. On April 18, 1906, Morris was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Little Rock, Arkansas, and Titular Bishop of Acmonia by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 11 from Bishop Byrne, with Bishops Edward Patrick Allen and Nicholas Aloysius Gallagher serving as co- consecrators, at St. Mary's Cathedral. He was the first native Tennessean to be elevated to the Catholic episcopacy. Upon the death of Bishop Edward Fitzgerald, Morris succeeded him as the third Bishop of Little Rock on February 21, 1907. Morris opened Little Rock College for Boys in 1908 at a cost of $50,000; and St. Joseph's Orphanage, which was completed at a cost of $150,000 and placed under the care of the Benedictine Sisters, in 1910. He presided over the first diocesan synod in February 1909, and established the first school for Catholic teachers during the following June. In 1911 he founded St. John Home Missions Seminary in 1911; Morris considered the seminary as the greatest accomplishment of his nearly 40-year-long tenure. That same year he established the diocesan newspaper, The Southern Guardian. He erected parishes for African Americans in El Dorado, Fort Smith, Helena, Hot Springs, Lake Village, Little Rock, North Little Rock, and Pine Bluff; he also opened an African American orphanage at Pine Bluff, which lasted from 1932 to 1937. He founded a school for boys near Searcy under the care of Poor Brothers of St. Francis, as well as a school for wayward girls run by the Good Shepherd Sisters in Hot Springs. Morris was confronted with a resurgence of anti-Catholicism early in his tenure, and during World War I many German American Catholics and German-speaking priests in Arkansas found themselves under suspicion. The Bishop, who was strongly patriotic and sold bonds during the war, helped mitigate such bigotry through his friendship with Arkansas politician Joseph Taylor Robinson. Despite the financial hardships of the Great Depression, he raised $20,000 to purchase an organ for the St. Andrew's Cathedral. Morris opened Catholic High School for Boys in 1930, and was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne the following year. During World War II, he publicly condemned anti-Semitism following the Kristallnacht attacks in November 1938. Morris received Albert Lewis Fletcher as an auxiliary bishop in 1940. During his tenure, he increased the number of priests from 60 to 154, and the number of schools from 29 to 80; by 1940, the diocese contained over 33,000 Catholics and 125 churches. Morris later died at the rectory of St. Andrew's Cathedral, aged 80. He is buried in the crypt under the Cathedral.

A member of the research staff at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington since 1982, Paul Silver made a series of important contributions to the investigation of seismic anisotropy and to earthquake research by observing the slow redistribution of stress and strain along fault zones. Paul Silver and his younger daughter Celine died in an automobile accident in North Carolina on August 7, 2009. Contributions to Geosciences One of Silver's principal research interests was seismic anisotropy and its implications for the tectonic evolution of the Earth.Solomon, S. C. (2009): Earth deformation, writ large. Nature Geosci. 2, 679 Link to paper (access restricted); Paul G. Silver (1948–2009). Eos Trans. AGU 90, 412f. Link to paper (PDF, access restricted) He organized and conducted seismic field experiments in northern Canada, southern Africa, Chile and Bolivia, China, and Tibet, as well in California and elsewhere in western North America. Silver and colleagues were the first to conduct, in 1989, a modern portable broadband seismic experiment. This experiment was designed to explore the deep structure of the North American continent, but also formed the starting point for the development of novel methods of seismological investigation: with Winston Chan, Martha Savage, and other colleagues, Silver elaborated on earlier workSilver, P. G., Chan, W. W. (1988): Implications for continental structure and evolution from seismic anisotropy. Nature 335, 34–39 Link to paper (access restricted) and deduced from the measurements the splitting of shear waves, a type of seismic anisotropy, for areas of the size of tectonic plates in order to determine the patterns of convection in the upper mantle and the deformation history of the continental and subcontinental lithosphere that record how the continent grew and evolved.Silver, P. G., Chan, W. W. (1991): Shear wave splitting and subcontinental mantle deformation. J. Geophys. Res. 96(B10), 16429–16454 Link to paper (access restricted) This approach has been developed ever since and is now in widespread use to study the patterns of convective flow in the Earth’s interior and the processes by which the continents were assembled. His shear-wave splitting studies with Mark Behn and Clint Conrad showed that the pattern of seismic anisotropy under oceanic lithosphere can be explained as being caused by mantle flow driven by plate motions and mantle density heterogeneity. With Behn, he also made the controversial proposition that plate tectonics on Earth is intermittent and may have been temporarily interrupted in the past when subduction largely ceased after the closure of a large ocean basin. An important observation was made possible by his serendipitous observation of the 1994 Bolivia earthquake during a field campaign in the region: the data recorded by his broadband seismograph array showed that the source region of this event, which is the largest deep quake on record (as of November 2009), is in conflict with the generally accepted view that such quakes are caused by phase transformations of mantle minerals. In a long-term study of small earthquakes triggered by a large event, the 1992 Landers, California earthquake, he and his colleagues discovered an annual cycle: fall had the greatest number of earthquakes, spring the least. The team found that this pattern could be related to barometric pressure changes: less pressure meant reduced stress on the faults, which permitted them to move more frequently. More recent work by him and his collaborators suggests that changes in the state of stress of the lithosphere induced by a large earthquake can alter the strength of faults and the seismic activity in an earthquake-prone area. In 2008, Silver was co-author of a paper showing there were subtle changes in the speed of seismic waves that preceded two small earthquakes, encouraging results for the field of earthquake forecasting In pursuit of his overarching goal of monitoring the deformation of the lithosphere on a continental scale, Silver played a key role in establishing the Plate Boundary Observatory, a part of the large EarthScope research program, which observes the tectonic activity throughout the western US and Alaska.

He would therefore have lived to a very advanced age indeed. However, Franz Babinger appears to have made a mistake. He confused Köse Mihal with Ghazi Mihal Bey, a grandson of Köse Mihal. Ghazi Mihal Bey built a now ruined Mosque complex, with an Imaret and Hamam, in Edirne, which was completed in 1422. The cemetery adjoining the complex holds the tomb of Ghazi Mihal Bey.Gazi Mihal Bey Camii (images, text, Turkish) queried on 8 September 2008 See also * Renegade thesis * Turgut Alp  Literature  * Dervish Ahmet-i 'Aşıki (called' Aşık Paşa, son): tevarihMenakıb u-i 'Al-i' Osman(Memories and times of the House of Osman).

The incident Around 19:00 on 10 June 1981, Alfredo fell into an artesian well which was very narrow and deep (about 30 cm wide and 80 m deep). His position, on arrival of the first rescuers, was estimated at around 36 m below ground level. To reach him, a parallel shaft was dug beside the well. Unfortunately, the drilling caused him to slip an estimated 30 m farther down the well. The drama caused unprecedented media attention, as the live broadcast on television went on for 18 hours nonstop. RAI, Italian public television, records audiences of 21 million people at peak times. The Italian President at the time, Sandro Pertini, personally visited the scene. As rescue attempts became more desperate, Angelo Licheri, a volunteer, was secured and lowered into the well to try to save Alfredo. He did manage to reach him and tried to secure a harness around him to pull him out, but failed. Dramatically, none of the further attempts to save him had success; in fact, he only slipped down lower and lower. Licheri was upside down in the well for 45 minutes and never completely recovered from the injuries caused by the descent. After many hours, Alfredo's voice (relayed by a microphone) was getting weaker and he is thought to have died around 6:30 on 13 June. Another volunteer, Donato Caruso, realized that he was dead while trying once again to secure a harness on him. His body was finally recovered a month later. Subsequently, Alfredo's mother, Franca Rampi, founded the \\"Rampi Center\\" that helps and encourages the civil protection of children.  Media furor  The attempted rescue was a major media event. It was the first time in Italy that a live outside broadcast had attracted millions of people to follow the events on TV. Initially, images were transmitted live because it was believed that there would be a quick and positive outcome. After some time the situation appeared to be slowly worsening, but it was too late to interrupt the transmissions. It posed many questions about privacy and the ethics of broadcasting such events which sparked a widespread public debate. The story also made the international news, a BBC Headlines broadcast carrying the story of a rescue attempt as its top headline on 12 June.  Mystery surrounding the accident  Later, some speculation arose surrounding the circumstances of the accident. During Alfredo's autopsy, he apparently was wearing a harness. Whilst being questioned by the police, Licheri said he had placed it on him when he was falling in the hope it might be used to save him. This theory was challenged by the fire brigade, who use a similar one, stating it would have been virtually impossible to have put it on him in the confines of the well. The judge of the case speculated he may have been lowered into the well, rather than falling in by accident. The investigations were, however, suspended as reaching a verdict was impossible. Lasting impact Italian alternative rock band Baustelle wrote a song about the tragedy. The song, \\"Alfredo\\", is track 10 on their 2008 album Amen. Among other prizes, Amen won that year's \\"Targa Tenco\\", one of the most prestigious music acknowledgments in Italy.

Restored Gomez motorcycle 3Engine detail Legnano with Tehuelche engine- single overhead cam with chain drive distribution Tehuelche was an Argentine motorcycle that was presented to the public in March 1957, and produced until 1964. Other attempts were made, mostly unsuccessful, to produce an Argentine motorcycle; however, the Tehuelche was the only motorcycle that was mass-produced continuously in its seven years of manufacturing in Argentina. It competed at a local level with other motorcycles, which were produced under license from European models and companies: the Puma Primera and Puma Segunda (from Guericke), the Zanella (from Ceccato), and the Gilera, among others. The Tehuelche distinguished itself not only by the characteristic sound of the gear train (SOHC engine), but also for its performance in its racing career. The beginning Legnano with Tehuelche engine- single overhead cam with gear drive distribution The creators, designers and manufacturers of the Tehuelche were Juan Raffaldi and Roberto Fattorini who arrived in Argentina from Italy in 1949, just after the Second World War. They came with a friend and a colleague, Carlo Preda, specifically for this project. Unlike many other immigrants from Italy, these men brought money and machinery with them to invest in the budding “Made in Argentina” industry, especially in the area of motorcycle manufacturing. They were encouraged by friends who were already established in the new country. During 1955, and after having worked on the design of a motorcycle that could be mass-produced, Raffaldi created a four-stroke engine of 50 cc displacement (single overhead camshaft- SOHC). This design was a little unusual for its time, because until then, it had been used primarily in racing motorcycles; further, it had no oil pump and it was made totally out of aluminum. Soon this engine was ready to participate in regional races, and showed its prowess with the impressive results that it obtained. Manufacture With a few partners, Raffaldi and Fattorini started the task of mass-producing a motorcycle with this brand new engine. For this purpose, they raised the engine capacity to 75 cc, with the purpose of entering a new market category. This first partnership barely lasted two years during which just over 1,200 motorcycles were produced. A new partnership, with the addition of other members, continued the production until the middle of 1964 by manufacturing approximately 3,500 motorcycles, bringing the total number of Tehuelches ever produced to almost 5,000. Of this total, no more than two hundred survived and about seventy are still functioning, making it a highly collectible motorcycle. The models In the almost seven years of manufacture, some of the colors and the decals of the Tehuelche were changed. In 1962, two models were produced: the Sport and the Super Sport, the latter bearing a speedometer. In addition, since the second partnership had the rights to import the Legnano motorcycle from Italy, a model of the Tehuelche was introduced that was called “Legnano”, with the motive of increasing sales. This model appeared on the market with a different gas tank and painted red and white. Finally, in 1964, toward the end of production, the camshaft that had been driven by gears was changed to a chain drive camshaft.

On one hand, there was inflation; the cost of beef, for example, rose 250% in 1959. On the other hand, there was the instability of the government. The continuous change of government during those years did not ensure any kind of permanence. Tired of coping with these circumstances, Rafaldi and Fattorini decided to abandon the partnership. They established their own workshop dedicated to prepare the same engines for racing motorcycles, and to cater to their clientele generally. In that workshop, they manufactured the “tapa 100”, a cylinder head which was bigger in size than what had been available and with better cooling capacity. They also incorporated into the motorcycle an oil pump, chain distribution for the camshaft and other details that improved the performance of the Tehuelche.

The young Fuller resents her father's rejection and dismissal of him as a neer-do-well and resolves to exact his revenge by mis-treating his new bride. After his abandonment, she bears a son who she names Archy Stillman. When the child gets older, the mother discovers that he possesses an incredible ability of smell, like a bloodhound. The mother instructs her child, now sixteen, to seek out his biological father with the intent of destroying that man's peace and reputation, and hence extracting satisfaction for her. Five years later in a second arc, at a mining camp in California, Fetlock Jones, a nephew of Sherlock Holmes, kills his master Flint Buckner, a silver-miner, by blowing up his cabin. Since this occurs when Holmes happens to be visiting, Holmes applies his skills to bear upon the case and derives a logically worked conclusion that is proved to be abysmally wrong by Archy Stillman using his sense of smell. This could be seen by the reader as yet another piece where Twain tried to prove that life does not quite follow logic. This is a satire by Twain on the mystery novel genre. In the second arc, Sherlock Holmes is depicted in employing \\"scientific methods\\" to a ridiculous degree, yet arriving at a completely wrong assessment. On the other hand, the crime is solved with a supernatural ability that no normal human possesses. Yet even this fails to reveal the whole truth as the final twist of the story indicates. Furthermore, Sam Clemens/Mark Twain poked through the \\"4th wall\\" and appeared as himself in the middle of the story, supposedly while the story was being serialized, and responded to letters sent in by readers to the newspaper editor. During the exchange, Twain made fun of/self-advertised on some of his other famous short stories.

Established in 1944, the company produces a variety of hydraulic cylinders, hydraulic pumps, valves, and power systems. History In the early 1940s B.J. Pasker ran a blacksmith shop in New Vienna, Iowa. In this shop his son, Jerry, produced farm wagons made from discarded automobile spindles and rims. During this period, Pasker also developed a hydraulically powered front loader which mounted to farm tractors. In 1944 Jerry Pasker outgrew the blacksmith shop and sought a larger facility for his operations. Energy in Monticello Iowa Jerry Pasker moved to South Cedar Street in Monticello, Iowa and was introduced to Harold Sovereign, who sold John Deere tractors and equipment. Pasker and Sovereign formed a partnership known as Industrious Farmer Equipment Company, and moved the business to the vacant second floor of Sovereign's dealership on South Cedar Street. In 1946 the business again outgrew its facility. To accommodate the expansion, Pasker purchased the property of an auto dealership on Main Street. During that time the company manufactured hydraulic components, wagon hoists, truck hoists, valves and hydraulic cylinders. In 1948 the company's name was changed to Energy Farm Equipment Company. In 1962 the business incorporated to become Energy Manufacturing Company, Inc., by which it is still known. Jerry Pasker was killed in a 22 July 1964 airplane crash in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; the company presidency then passed to LaVon Pasker. Energy Manufacturing after Jerry Pasker In 1976 Energy completed construction of a new plant on in the Monticello Industrial park. In 1985 Energy Manufacturing Company was sold to CGF Industries of Topeka, Kansas. CGF also purchased an Omaha Nebraska company called \\"Williams Machine and Tool\\". In 1997 Energy was purchased by Lincolnshire Partners and in 1999 Energy was purchased by Textron, Inc. Textron ran the company for 5 years until Energy was acquired by an investment group. On November 15, 2005 Energy added to the facility office space for administrative and manufacturing support. Energy 2005 - 2013 Energy designs and manufactures custom welded hydraulic cylinders. It also designs and manufactures hydraulic valves, pumps, powerpacks and power systems.

It is mostly agricultural and home to one of the largest communities of the Taivoan people. In 2009, Typhoon Morakot brought unprecedented rainfall to southern Taiwan, including Siaolin. A landslide dam upstream of Siaolin failed catastrophically, resulting in a devastating mudflow to completely cover the northern half of the village. 471 people lost their lives in the incident.  History  Due to the influx of Siraya people in early 18th century to Yujin Basin, Taivoan people started to migrate from Tainan to Kaohsiung between 1722 and 1744. Nearly 150 years later, some Taivoan people from Aliguan in Kaohsiung further migrated to a river terrace to the north of Aliguan for hunting. During the Japanese Occupation Period, in order to have Taivoan people counter the Mountain Indigenous people so as to control the camphor forest in Jiasian and Namasia, Japanese government collectively moved more Taivoan people to the river terrace, which later became Siaolin Village in 1904, said to be named after the family name of the local Japanese police officer Kobayashi (Hiragana: こばやし; ). Geography Siaolin is the largest village within Jiasian District, covering the northern half of the district. It sits in a valley along the Qishan River, surrounded by the Alishan Range to the west and the Yushan Range to the east. There are two major settlements within Siaolin Village: Siaolin to the north, and Wulipu to the south. Typhoon Morakot Between August 6, 2009, and August 10, 2009, Taiwan was hit by Typhoon Morakot, which brought about unprecedented rainfall and flooding across the country. The heavy rainfall caused landslides in mountainous regions in southern Taiwan, especially Jiasian, Liugui, Taoyuan, and Namaxia districts. According to National Taiwan University professor Chen Hong-yu, in the 5 day period before the landslide, Qishan River and the nearby Laonong River carried an abnormal amount of sediment. The sediment carried during the typhoon exceeded 80% of the sediment that the Gaoping River, which both rivers empty into, carries in an entire year. Debris flow and landslide dam Former site of Siaolin after the incident. At 6:16 AM, a debris flow occurred from a height of 1445 m on Xiandu Mountain, located upstream on the Qishan River from Siaolin. Saturated with water, 23,000,000 cubic meters of soil rushed downhill at a speed of 50 m/s into the Qishan River. Witnesses reported that two large bangs were heard on Xiandu Mountain immediately prior to the debris flow. The slide immediately covered the northern half of Siaolin and formed a landslide dam, blocking the river's flow. Within 50 minutes, the landslide dam failed catastrophically, causing another debris flow with a 38% solid composition to erupt downstream, covering the rest of Siaolin. The average depth of the flow was 44.6 m. In the incident, the entirety of Siaolin, including around 169 residences, were covered by the flooding. Wulipu, which had a higher elevation, was not damaged. The incident resulted in the deaths of 471 people.  Response  A bus driven by 60 year-old Bang Rong-gui was just leaving Siaolin when Bang saw the landslide. Dropping off his passengers in Wulipu, he turned around and went back to transport more survivors. He managed to pick up 30 more people, but was unfortunately covered by a separate landslide. All lives aboard were lost. Initially, rescuers and soldiers were dispatched by the government to look for survivors, but no progress was made due to poor weather conditions. Helicopters from Shanlin District were grounded, while collapsed road surfaces along Highway 29 also prevented rescuers from reaching the settlement. The following day, twenty one rescuers, eight from the district fire department and thirteen from the military, arrived in Siaolin via helicopter. They reported that out of all the buildings, only 2 were left standing. Soon after, more helicopters were sent out, rescuing 61 people from Siaolin and 14 from other villages. Survivors were directed to evacuation centers in Wulipu, Qishan, and Meinong. Officials from the district fire department also entered the settlement via foot, reporting that around 500-600 people may have lost their lives. On August 11, rescuers were finally able to reach the settlement by car. Excavators were brought to find dead bodies, but none were found. Emergency housing was set up in Wulipu for Siaolin survivors. Due to safety concerns, residents and family members were not allowed to enter the settlement. However, people still snuck in by foot. Evidence of incense being burned were found on the bridge number 8, connecting Siaolin with Wulipu. On August 13, residents were allowed to enter the village guided by the military.  Aftermath  Taivoan festival held at the new elementary school. Three permanent settlements for residents were built, with one in Wulipu, one on Taiwan Sugar's land in Shanlin, and third on Tsu Chi's land in Shanlin. The first two villages are organized by the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, while the third is by Tsu Chi. Xiaolin Elementary School was rebuilt in Wulipu in 2012. A memorial park at the site of Xiaolin was constructed with 100 trees, symbolizing the families that lost their lives in the landslide. Some pointed to a construction by the Water Resources Agency as the cause of the landslide. Since 2003, a pipeline was under construction to redirect water from the Laonong River into the Caolan River, which would feed into the Zengwen Reservoir. The pipeline passes north of Siaolin, near the site of the landslide. Some blame this construction for weakening the soil and causing the landslide; however, the government held that the heavy rainfall was the real cause. After the incident, construction of the pipeline continued for a year, but was halted due to backlash from residents. After the landslide, researchers found a new fault line at the site of the landslide. Minor planet 185636, discovered by Lulin Observatory, was named \\"Siao Lin\\" in memorial of Siaolin Village.

He is best known for his role in the 1925 Chicago Cardinals–Milwaukee Badgers scandal, where Folz hired a group of high school football players from his alma mater, Chicago's Engelwood High School, to play for the Milwaukee Badgers, against the Cardinals. During the recruitment, Folz reportedly told the high schoolers that the game was a \\"practice game\\" and would in no part affect their amateur status. The plan would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was then used to help prop up their win-loss percentage and as a chance of wrestling away the 1925 NFL Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. For his involvement, Folz was barred from playing football in the NFL for life by NFL President Joseph Carr. However, in 1926, Folz's lifetime ban was lifted, probably to prevent him from joining the first American Football League; even so, he chose not to return to pro football. The scandal also played a role in the 1925 NFL Championship controversy.

The amalgamation of several major geographical units by the working group for Ecological balance and Regional Character at the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig, that includes a break-up of the old natural region of Oberlausitz, has not been fully recognised officially, because this division has not yet been accepted by federal authorities like the Bundesamt für Naturschutz (BfN), but does broadly follow the logic of other groupings such as that of the Thuringian-Franconian Upland which border it to the west and includes the Thuringian Forest, Thuringian Highland, Franconian Forest and Fichtelgebirge. Whilst the Thuringian-Franconian Upland, like the adjacent Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest run from northwest to southeast, these low Saxon mountains generally run from west-southwest to east-northeast. The Vogtland, whose German section lies mainly in the natural region in the Free State of Saxony that gives it its name, forms the actual link to the Thuringian-Franconian Upland.

History Festival 500 began in 1997 as part of the Cabot 500 celebrations, a series of events commemorating the 500th anniversary of John Cabot's arrival in Bonavista, Newfoundland in 1497. The inaugural festival was planned to coincide with the anniversary visit of Queen Elizabeth II, who attended the gala opening concert in June 1997. The festival invited choirs from all around the world (33 countries in 2009), who would have to send audition tapes and subsequently be invited to attend. During the day, the choirs would attend workshops, clinics and masterclasses, as well as perform for free at places across the city, including the airport, hotel lobbies and churches. Concerts in the Afternoon and The World of Music concert series were both concerts open to the public, during which up to four choirs perform individually, then combine at the end for two to three pieces led by one of the invited conductors. The festival concluded with the Grande Finale, a massive concert held at Mile One Centre. During the concert, there were two massed-choir projects, one involving all youth choirs and the other with the adult choirs. Both are led by one of the two invited conductors and are accompanied by the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra. The final act of the finale was the Guest Artist, usually one of the main local draws to the festival. Since 1997, there have been more than 10,000 participants from 38 countries, 22 U.S. States and 11 Canadian Provinces / Territories. The last festival of this form was held in 2013. Since 2014, Festival 500: Sharing the Voices has now become Growing the Voices: Festival 500, and focuses on giving people the opportunity to sing around the world. Symposium In 1999, the festival introduced The Phenomenon of Singing, a week-long academic symposium as a prelude to the choral festival. The symposium was designed to address a variety of aspects of singing and the human voice including artistic, physiological, cultural, sociological, historical, pedagogical, psychological, creative/compositional. 2011 The 2011 Symposium differed from previous years because it overlapped the festival, starting on July 10 rather than after the festival had finished.

He toured Europe in the 1970s.Harris, S. (1981). Blues Who's Who. New York: Da Capo Press. pp. 589–590. Biography John Thomas Wrencher was born in Sunflower, Mississippi. He became interested in music as a child and taught himself to play the harmonica at an early age. Beginning in the early 1940s, he worked as an itinerant musician in Tennessee, Missouri, Indiana, and Illinois. By the mid-1940s he had arrived in Chicago and was playing on Maxwell Street and at house parties with Jimmy Rogers, Claude \\"Blue Smitty\\" Smith and John Henry Barbee.Tooze, S. B. (1997). Muddy Waters: The Mojo Man. Toronto, Ontario: ECW Press. p. 65. In the 1950s he moved to Detroit, where he worked with the singer and guitarist Baby Boy Warren and formed his own trio, which performed in the Detroit area and in Clarksdale, Mississippi. In 1958 Wrencher lost his left arm as a result of a car accident outside Memphis, Tennessee. By the early 1960s he had settled in Chicago, where he became a fixture on Maxwell Street Market, in particular playing from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays. In 1964 he appeared in a documentary film about Maxwell Street, entitled And This Is Free; performances by Wrencher recorded in the process of making the film were eventually issued on a three-CD set, And This Is Maxwell Street. During the 1960s he recorded for the Testament label backing Robert Nighthawk and as part of the Chicago String Band.Rucker, L., ed. (1998). Music Hound Blues: The Essential Album Guide. Visible Ink Press. pp. 300, 445. In 1969 he recorded for Barrelhouse Records, backed by the guitarist Little Buddy Thomas and the drummer Playboy Vinson, who formed his Maxwell Street band at that time. The resulting album, Maxwell Street Alley Blues, was described as \\"superlative in every regard\\" by Cub Koda, writing for Allmusic. Wrencher toured Europe with the Chicago Blues Festival in 1973 and with the American Blues Legends in 1974. On the latter tour he recorded an album in London for Big Bear Records, backed by the guitarist Eddie Taylor and his band. During a trip to Mississippi to visit his family in July 1977, Wrencher died suddenly of a heart attack in Wade Walton's barbershop in Clarksdale, Mississippi.

Predominantly an open working space for software projects, the Dojo hosts a range of events from technology classes to biology, computer hardware, and manufacturing and is open to all types of hackers.  Organization  The Dojo is run mostly democratically by its membership under the oversight of five elected directors. Anybody can become a member, and hardship, worktrade and family rates are available. Member votes rarely deal with specific instances, and more work with general policy on how the Dojo should run. The Dojo is primarily financed through membership dues ($125/mo), but has historically accepted 3rd party sponsorships from Microsoft, Google, isocket, Twilio, AMS Dataserfs, and Palantir Technologies to fund expansions and renovations.  Culture  The Dojo is entirely communal space from the tools in the electronics lab to the desks to the food in the refrigerator. Anything left there is considered fair game for anybody to play with. Very few restrictions are placed upon people provided they do not detract from the experience of members or consume resources they do not replace. Any member may run an event, and event organizers are permitted to charge non-members for attendance to their event. Members are always permitted to go everywhere they wish, provided they do not consume somebody else's finite resources (such as an event's food).  Physical Space  The Hacker Dojo was originally located at 140 South Whisman Road in Mountain View, CA. The facility started as being only 140A but the space expanded to include 140B in October 2009, and further expanded in October 2011 to lease units C and D, thus taking over the entirety of 140 S. Whisman. The expansion party was attended by several hundred individuals, including Steven Levy. Because of zoning violations, the City of Mountain View blocked the use of units C and D, and restricted the use of units A and B to events no larger than 49 occupants., 140A was formerly an industrial artistic glassworking facility, though the community has put the space through a significant series of renovations. In order to raise money to help meet building code requirements, the Dojo staged an \\"underwear run,\\" on Saint Patrick's Day as a fund raiser. Construction bids to bring the 140 South Whisman space up to building code requirements came in much higher than expected, and on Monday, October 15, 2012, the Dojo signed a lease to rent a building at 599 Fairchild Drive, also in Mountain View. Move-in occurred on February 13, 2013, and a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on February 27, 2013 The lease on the building at 599 Fairchild Drive ran through May 31, 2016, at which time the Dojo moved to its third home, located at 3350 Thomas Road in Santa Clara. Controversies Distributed denial of service attack Members at Hacker Dojo could not access the Internet during several outages occurring between June 22 and July 14, 2013. The problem was eventually traced to an amplified distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) attack. In this case, the perpetrator was sending forged Domain Name Service (DNS) requests to multiple domain name servers, causing the servers to send large amounts data records to the Hacker Dojo, thereby overloading the system and preventing legitimate use of the network. Dojo managers made several attempts to stop the attacks, but were unsuccessful. Eventually, they requested help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which determined the outages were the result of a criminal act by Jason David Miller, a former Dojo member. According to the indictment, Miller had become a member on May 19, 2013, using the first name \\"ad\\" and the last name \\"min,\\" such that his username became \\"ad.min\\" and his email address \\"ad.min@hackerdojo.com.\\" Dojo management forbids misleading usernames, and terminated his email account. On June 1, 2013, Miller re-registered as \\"Dallas Smith,\\" and began attacking the Dojo's internet service a few weeks later, starting on June 22, 2013. He is charged with violation of Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030(a)(5)(A) and (c)(4)(B)(i)—Intentionally Causing Damage to a Protected Computer. Miller was indicted in May 2014. Miller claims he only intended to engage in a harmless prank. He had been a teaching assistant, researcher, and Eagle Scout. He was scheduled to be sentenced on October 3, 2016, in the courtroom of Judge Edward J. Davila in San Jose. Embezzlement In March, 2016, a local newspaper published an article saying the Dojo was facing a leadership crisis and that an employee had been accused of embezzlement.  Uses  The three primary uses of Hacker Dojo are for events, as a coworking space, and for social purposes.  Events  The 140B building has been turned into a place where events such as Random Hacks of Kindness, Startup Weekend, and BayThreat among others have been hosted. It also has invented and run its own events such as a reverse job fair call the Hacker Fair where candidates present booths of their previous independent or open source work to company engineers who are accompanied by technical recruiters and the Startup Fair, where young companies have booths for investors to consider. Members can hold events at the Dojo free of charge, subject to approval from the Dojo events committee.  Coworking  A large number of Silicon Valley startups work daily out of the Hacker Dojo as their primary location, and Founders Institute, which is located nearby, encourages its members to work out of the Dojo  Notable Startups With Hacker Dojo History  * Pinterest—the two founders met and built the first iteration of the product at Hacker Dojo * Word Lens—acquired by Google * Pebble Watches * Infometers.com—acquired by Validic.com * Skydera * NetworkedBlogs\\"Waleed Abdulla, founder of NetworkedBlogs\\" HotDevs.com.

The most common causes are accidents with grease guns, paint sprayers, and pressure washers, but working on diesel and gasoline engine fuel injection systems as well as pinhole leaks in pressurized hydraulic lines can also cause this injury. Additionally, there is at least one known case of deliberate self-injection with a grease gun. Although the initial wound often seems minor, the unseen, internal damage can be severe. With hydraulic fluids, paint, and detergents, these injuries are extremely serious as most hydraulic fluids and organic solvents are highly toxic. Delay in surgical treatment often leads to amputations or death. But even with pure water or air, these injuries cause compartment syndrome which leads to cell death if surgical intervention is delayed.

She stood successfully as an independent candidate within the DTP supported Thousand Hopes alliance in the 2007 parliamentary election in Turkey and became an MP for Diyarbakır. During the campaign she was quoted as saying, \\"This election is important because Turkey is at a crossroads. Either it is going to opt for developing democratic alternatives or will bring the oppressive policies back on to the agenda. We are hoping for the democratic forces to come out of these elections much stronger and help to establish the options of democracy dialog and peace. We'll search for solutions not in violence, but in parliament.\\" In the beginning of 2009 it was reported that she had prepared a bill to enable the Kurdish language to be used in the public space. For the Parliamentary Elections in 2011 she was elected as an independent candidate from southeastern Siirt province. In 2014 she was elected Mayor of Diyarbakır.

In November, public prosecutors demanded a 230-year prison sentence for Kışanak. In February 2019 she was sentenced to 14 years and 3 months in prison for \\"being a member of a terrorist organization\\" and for \\"propaganda of a terrorist organization\\".

It was intended to allow more powerful electrically-driven accessories, and lighter automobile wiring harnesses. Electric motors were proposed to be used for power steering or other systems, providing more compact installations and eliminating the weight of drive belts or large wires for high-current loads. The proposed new standard was exactly triple the voltage of existing \\"12 volt\\" systems. The higher voltage was selected to provide greater power capacity for wiring and devices on one hand, and to stay under the 50 volt limit used as a guideline for electric shock hazard. The European auto manufacturer Daimler-Benz proposed a 42V brand name for the conversion. Although many manufacturers were predicting a switch to 36-volt (lithium-ion battery) / 42-volt (charging voltage) electrical systems, the changeover has not occurred, and the plans appear to have been canceled. The availability of higher-efficiency motors, new wiring techniques and digital controls, and a focus on hybrid vehicle systems that use high-voltage starter/generators has largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages. Applications that once were thought to require higher voltages, such as electrical power steering, have now been achieved with 12 volt systems. 42-volt electrical components are now used in only a few automotive applications, since incandescent light bulbs work well at 12 volts and switching of a 42-volt circuit is more difficult. 48 volt systems are being deployed in mild hybrid vehicles, which add electric assistance to the propulsion and regeneration during braking for fuel savings.  History   USA – Consortium on Advanced Automotive Electrical and Electronic Systems  The SAE discussed an increased automobile standard voltage as early as 1988. In 1994, at the initiative of Daimler-Benz, the first \\"Workshop on Advanced Architectures for Automotive Electrical Distribution Systems\\" was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (MIT/LEES) in Cambridge, Massachusetts USA. with the aim of defining the architecture for a future automotive electrical system. From the outset, the participants in this workshop included suppliers as well as the automobile companies Daimler-Benz, Ford and General Motors. In September 1995, various electrical systems architectures were compared at MIT using the tool \\"MAESTrO\\", and in December 1995, in the \\"Conclusions\\" of this study, a future voltage level of approximately was defined. In early 1996, the \\"Consortium on Advanced Automotive Electrical and Electronic Systems\\" was set up. At the ensuing workshop in March 1996, the future nominal voltage of 42 V was confirmed. In August 1996, IEEE Spectrum published the paper \\"Automotive electrical systems circa 2005\\". On the occasion of the October 1996 Convergence in Detroit, Professor John G. Kassakian (MIT) gave a talk entitled \\"The Future of Automotive Electrical Systems\\" as part of the \\"IEEE Workshop on Automotive Power- Electronics\\". On March 24, 1997, Daimler-Benz presented the MIT with a \\"Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V\\".  Europe  At the same time as the activities in the USA, in 1994, again at the initiative of Daimler-Benz, the former SICAN GmbH held its first \\"Forum Bordnetz\\" (Vehicle Electrical System Forum) in Hanover for German automobile companies. Here too, suppliers were invited to participate at a very early stage, together with all European vehicle manufacturers. On February 15, 1996, the introductory paper \\"Bordnetzarchitektur im Jahr 2005\\" (Automotive electrical system architecture for the year 2005) was agreed, and on June 4, 1996, BMW presented the \\"Tabelle heutiger und zukünftiger Verbraucher im Kfz\\" (Table of present and future loads in the motor vehicle) and the \\"42V/14V-Bordnetz\\" (42V/14V PowerNet). On September 13, 1996, at the 7th International Technical Meeting for Vehicle Electronics in Baden-Baden, considerable interest was raised by the paper \\"Neue Bordnetz- Architektur und Konsequenzen\\" (New Automotive Electrical System Architecture and Consequences), presented by Dr. Richard D. Tabors (MIT). On March 6, 1997, BMW presented the \\"Spezifikationsentwurf für das Zwei-Spannungsbordnetz 42V/14V\\" (Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V) in Hanover. The work at SICAN GmbH was given decisive impetus by the cooperation between BMW and Daimler-Benz, as witnessed in their joint definition of the European \\"Load List 2005\\" and the jointly authored \\"Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V\\". In 2011, several German car makers agreed on a 48V on-board electric power supply network supplementing the current 12V network and introduced the \\"Combo plug\\", a common power plug for DC charging electric vehicles. As of 2018, this 48-volt electrical system has been applied in production vehicles such as Porsche and Bentley SUVs, and Volvo and Audi plan to use the 48-volt standard in 2019 vehicles.  Choice of voltage  Six-cell lead-acid batteries produce around 12.6 volts while discharging, and their corresponding automotive alternators are designed to produce 13.5 to during charging. is an approximation of the output of the new standard's charging system. The present nominally automotive electrical system usually operates around so is descriptive. Literature on electrical systems often refers to systems powered with a 6-cell lead-acid battery as nominally Depending on operating conditions, the vehicle electrical system voltage today can vary between with a varying degree of ripple superimposed on this value. After extensive preparatory work, resulting in the \\"List of Loads in the Automobile of the Year 2005\\", various automotive electrical system architectures were compared using the tool \\"MAESTrO\\" ( and ) in the September 1995 workshop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT/LEES). The finding of this study was that the highest possible direct voltage was the best alternative. The limiting factor for direct voltages is a shock-hazard protection limit of which must not be exceeded even during voltage fluctuations caused by extreme conditions. This limit eliminates the option of an automotive electrical system with a nominal battery voltage of because at low temperatures the charging voltage of the battery can attain Also, the price, weight and volume of batteries are influenced by the number of cells, which must therefore be kept to a minimum. New battery technologies for automotive applications would not have been available at affordable costs for the PowerNet. Lead-acid batteries are low-priced and have a very \\"compliant\\" charging/discharging characteristic. Therefore, lead-acid batteries would have been used optimised for energy and service life at the lower voltage and optimised for power at the higher voltage. Another important criterion for a new architecture was that it should allow gradual conversion of loads to the higher voltage system as required. In a system, the branch should have been freed of higher-power loads and should operate within much narrower limits. Power electronics is becoming increasingly important in the automotive sphere and will be a decisive factor in the price of future vehicles. This criterion was therefore especially important when selecting the most suitable higher voltage level. Despite the considerable upward trend of power electronics in automotive applications, its share of the market will decline, because growth rates in other market segments are even higher. For that reason alone, a specific manufacturing technology for automotive use is inconceivable. In intensive discussions with the major semiconductor manufacturers, a voltage of approximately was found to be advantageous. Many arguments are summarised in the paper \\"Intelligente Leistungshalbleiter für zukünftige Kfz- Bordnetze\\"Intelligente Leistungshalbleiter für zukünftige Kfz-Bordnetze (\\"Intelligent Power Semiconductors for Future Automotive Electrical Systems\\") presented by the former Siemens Semiconductors (now Infineon) at the 17th \\"Elektronik im Kraftfahrzeug\\" (In-Car Electronics) conference on June 3/4, 1997 in Munich. Other arguments for a higher voltage included the reduction of weight in the wiring system, improved stability, and reduced voltage drop. With three times the voltage, thick conductors can be reduced to a third of the cross-section, and at the same time the relative voltage drop can also be reduced to a third. For the same cross-section, the relative voltage drop is now no more than one ninth. The voltage level resulting from these arguments was so close to three times the present voltage that became the automatic choice for the second voltage level.

It is located along Winthrop Shore Drive, spanning the roadway. The beach begins off Crest Avenue at an area known as the \\"Green Bars\\", named for the green railings along the seawall. The beach ends at the base of Water Tower Hill. The ocean has five wave breakers known as the \\"Five Sisters\\" offshore to protect nearby neighborhoods from the large swells that occur during storms. Winthrop Beach is open year round to the public from dawn to dusk, and lifeguards are on duty from late June to early September. History Between the mid-1600s and late 1800s, the beach was used almost entirely for utilitarian purposes, including clam digging, and lobster fishing. Even the kelp from the rocks was harvested and used as fertilizer. By the 1890s, the Winthrop Branch of the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad commuter rail was extended all the way to Winthrop Beach. Thanks to the arrival of public transportation, the town's flagship beach became popular with city-dwellers from Boston and beyond. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts purchased the Winthrop Shore Reservation area in 1900. Unlike nearby Revere Beach in Revere, Winthrop Beach did not develop a boardwalk or extensive commercial district of its own. Restoration In September 2012, state contractors broke ground on a major $17-million restoration project. Over two years the Department of Conservation and Recreation plans to repair the badly eroded shoreline by adding 450,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel. Since the construction of a series of offshore breakwaters known locally as \\"the Five Sisters\\" in the 1930s, a significant volume of sediment has accumulated behind the Five Sisters creating a large tombolo. These offshore breakwaters have also contributed to increased erosion on the southern portion of Winthrop Beach, leaving the seawall, Winthrop Shore Drive and adjacent residences vulnerable to storm damage. In addition to repairing degraded \\"groin structures,\\" the project's final phase calls for widening sidewalks on Winthrop Shore Drive, and the addition of new lighting, benches, sand-rinsing stations, and upgraded beach entrances.

A member class within the patrician ruling elite,Wörterbuch der schweizerdeutschen Sprache, Schweizerisches Idiotikon - Dictionary of the Swiss German Language, Verlag Huber Frauenfeld, Frauenfeld, Switzerland, 1881, Volume IV, Page 1584, in German. the Grand Burgher was a type of urban citizen and social order of highest rank, a formally defined upper social class of affluent individuals and elite burgher families in medieval German-speaking city-states and towns under the Holy Roman Empire, who usually were of a wealthy business or significant mercantile background and estate. This hereditary title and influential constitutional status, privy to very few individuals and families across Central Europe, formally existed well into the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century. In autonomous German-speaking cities and towns of Central Europe that held a municipal charter, town privileges (German town law) or were a free imperial city such as Hamburg, Augsburg, Cologne and Bern that held imperial immediacy, where nobility had no power of authority or supremacy, the Grand Burghers (Großbürger) or patricians (\\"Patrizier\\") constituted the ruling class. Hierarchy Portrait of Grand Burghers Jakob Fugger von der Lilie and wife Sibylle Artzt (ca. 1500). Jakob Fugger von der Lilie Großbürger zu Augsburg (1459-1525) at that time period was known as one of Europe's most significant merchants, mining entrepreneur and banker, who elevated to Grand Burgher of Augsburg through marriage to his wife Sibylle Artzt Großbürgerin zu Augsburg the daughter of an eminent Augsburg Grand Burgher (Großbürger). Since before the 15th century the group of legally coequal \\"burghers\\" started to split into three different groups: hereditary grand-burghers, ordinary burghers termed petty-burghers (German Kleinbürger or simply Bürger) made up largely of artisans, tradesman, business owners, merchants, shopkeepers and others who were obliged according to city or town constitution to acquire the ordinary petty-burghership,Free Trade and its Reception 1815-1960: Freedom and trade, Volume 1, Andrew Marisson, Routledge Explorations in Economic History, London and New York, 1998, p. 110—111. and non-burghers, the latter being merely \\"inhabitants\\" or otherwise resident aliens without specific legal rights in the territorial jurisdiction of a city or town and largely consisted of the working class, foreign or migrant workers and other civil employees who were neither able nor eligible to acquire the ordinary petty-burghership.Willi Albers, Anton Zottmann, Organisation bis Sozialhilfe und Sozialhilfegesetz, Volume 6 of Handwörterbuch der Wirtschaftswissenschaften (HdWW), 1988, p. 681 Burghership in general gave a person the right to exist in the territorial jurisdiction of the city-state or town of burghership, be an active member of its society, acquire real estate, pursue their specified economic activity or occupation, access social protection and participate in municipal affaires amongst many other exclusive constitutional rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities, especially that of the \\"grand\\" burghership (German: Großbürgerschaft). 16th-century oil painting portrait of Grand Burgheress Katharina Völker of Frankfurt (German Großbürgerin Katharina Völker zu Frankfurt), at the Historical Museum Frankfurt. The 16th-century oil painting is valued at above 100,000 Euro and was stolen from the museum in 2008, the painting was subsequently recovered by the German Police. Grand Burghers held rich historical and cultural roles created and expanded over the decades, including union with other families of the same eminent status and branches of nobility, Grand Burghers were often of such extraordinary wealth and significant economic importance that they far exceeded the wealth and influence of even the most highest-ranking members of nobility, the latter often sought inter-marriage with elite grand-burgher families to maintain their noble lifestyles. The names of the individuals and families is generally known in the city or town where they lived, and in many cases, their ancestors had contributed to regional history. The conferred grand-burghership was in most instances hereditary in both their male and female family descendants, and a hereditary title or rank stated as the person's occupation in records. In Hamburg for example only the Grand Burghers were privileged to full unrestricted freedom of large-scale trade, including unrestricted foreign import and export trade, were allowed to entertain a bank account, as well as be elected to the Senate of Hamburg, amongst other privileges.Matthias Wegner: Hanseaten, Berlin 1999, S. 34: „In Hamburg wurde sehr genau zwischen dem großen und dem kleinen Bürgerrecht unterschieden, und nur wer dank seiner ökonomischen Verhältnisse imstande war, das große Bürgerrecht zu erwerben, verfügte über die uneingeschränkte Handels- und Gewerbefreiheit, durfte in den Senat, die Bürgerschaft und andere Ämter gewählt werden – und das waren nur wenige.“ Confer of burghership As with the administration expense for conferring letters patent to nobility, both types of burghership were also subject to expenses. The burghership expense in Hamburg in year 1600 was 50 Reichstaler for the grand and 7 Reichstaler for the petty burghership, in 1833 the initial expense for receiving grand burghership in Hamburg was 758 Mark 8 Schilling (Hamburg Mark); that of the petty burghership, 46 Mk 8 Sh.Claudia Thorn, Handelsfrauen, Bürgerfrauen und Bürgerwitwen. Zur Bedeutung des Bürgerrechts für Frauen in Hamburg im 19. Jahrhundert bis zu seiner Aufhebung 1864, Hamburg, 1995, Other ways to become a Grand Burgher were to marry a grand burgher or, subject to meeting constitutional conditions, the daughter of a grand burgher born in the city or town. These rules varied locally. German Revolution of 1918–19 Following the German Revolution of 1918–19, the German \\"Großbürger\\" along with German nobility as a legally defined class was abolished on August 11, 1919 with the promulgation of the Weimar Constitution, under which all Germans were made equal before the law, and the legal rights and privileges due to the Großbürger (Grand Burgher) and all ranks of nobility ceased. Any title, however, held prior to the Weimar Constitution, were permitted to continue merely as part of the family name and heritage, or erased from future name use. The Grand Burghers would nevertheless continue to retain their powerful economic significance, political authority and influence, as well as their personal status and importance in society, beyond the Weimar Constitution. Other states, other developments It seems that this medieval German concept has been taken over by other countries and cities. In Hamburg, hereditary grand and ordinary petty burghership were existing before 1600,Mirjam Litten, Bürgerrecht und Bekenntnis: Städtische Optionen zwischen Konfessionalisierung und Säkularisierung in Münster, Hildesheim und Hamburg, 2003, S. 30 and in like manner, France. In 1657 the Dutch council of New Netherland for example established criteria for the rights of burghers in New Amsterdam (present day New York City), distinguishing between \\"great\\" and \\"petty\\" burgher rights following the distinction made in this regard in Amsterdam 1652.Janny Venema, Beverwijck: a Dutch village on the American frontier, 1652-1664, 2003, p. 107 In New Amsterdam during the mid-1600s the ordinary petty-burghership was conferred at the administration expense of 20 Dutch florin, the hereditary great-burghership 50 fl. 1664 the concept was assumed by Beverwijck (present day Albany).

He moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1997 and continued living and working in Palestine, the United States (Boston and San Francisco) and Jordan. Mohsen composed, arranged, (re)interpreted and performed music for television, plays, films and live audiences. After receiving a grant to record his second classical Arabic music (instrumental) CD, Mohsen Subhi (also known as Abu Kinaan) died as a result of an unfortunate accident on August 2, 2009 in Ramallah. He was buried in Al-Bireh.  Education and training  Subhi in Cambridge, MA (June 1998) Mohsen began teaching himself music at the age of seven, initially as a percussionist and later on adopting the Oud as his main instrument.http://www.oud.eclipse.co.uk/ Master oud player Hatem Al-Afghani was among Mohsen's early music teachers.http://palestinianpride.org/contactus.aspx In the United States, Mohsen attended classes at Berklee in Boston and the Longy School of Music (Cambridge, MA) where he continued developing his unique style. Early career Mohsen composed, arranged, (re)interpreted and performed music for educational purposes, television, plays, dance troupes, films and live audiences. He also taught percussion and/or Oud to children and adults through institutions, schools and private lessons in Ramallah and Jerusalem (Palestine) as well as Boston (1997–1999) and later on, San Francisco (U.S.) Although best known as an Oud player, Mohsen also used the Buzuq, and was no less talented as a percussionist playing derbakeh (tabla), taar, mazhar (frame drum), and daf (tambourine) fusing Arab, Persian, Indian and African rhythms. Raseef al-Madeena Mohsen Subhi played buzuk and percussion with the Ramallah- based group, Al-Rahhala including its 1988 \\"Raseef al-Madeena\\".  Later musical works  Zaghareed While serving as the Music Director of the Palestinian National Music and Dance Troupe (El Funoun) in Palestine, Mohsen composed the music to their popular production “Zaghareed” (also Zaghareet) Ululations in 1997. . Mohsen's reinterpretation and rearrangement of traditional Palestinian folkloric wedding songs was choreographed and danced by the internationally recognized Palestinian dabkeh group, El Funoun Dance Troupe and performed starting 1997. Zaghareed could be best described as \\"an artistic work that combined authenticity with originality, traditional raw material with more modernistic dance components, and finally a very Palestinian theme with attributes that carry a universal appeal.\\". Mawasem In 2006, the Lebanon-based independent record label Incognitohttp://www.incognito.com.lb/store/node/296 released Mohsen Subhi's instrumental, Mawasem [Seasons], the first compilation of his renowned composition of oud pieces, accompanied by bass, cello and piano (featuring Antoine Lammam - percussions). . In Mawasem, explains Jihad Touma, \\"Subhi starts in maqam, in a circle widening with revelation, proceeding to a point where, necessarily, commentary falls short.\\" (translated from Arabic from the backcover of Mawasem).http://www.welove-music.net/2009/05/mohsen-subhi-was- born-in-ramallah.html Touma continues, > And then there is the passage...

Retrieved 20 August 2009. The group made many appearances on radio, television, and at national and international venues and festivals. They performed a mixture of British traditional folk music and new material, including compositions by Campbell. Much of their popularity flowed from the variety of their performance which included a mixture of solos, group vocals and instrumentals. History The group formed in 1956 in Birmingham, as the Clarion Skiffle Group. The band was renamed the Ian Campbell Folk Group in 1958 and became one of the most respected, popular and influential folk groups of the British folk scene of the 1960s. The group's first recordings included the EP, Ceilidh at the Crown, which was released in 1962 and was the first live folk club recording to be released on vinyl.Larkin C 'Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) p91 During this period Spencer Davis (12 string guitar) and Christine Perfect (piano) performed with them before pursuing separate careers. In 1963, they signed to Transatlantic Records and released their first studio album, This is The Ian Campbell Folk Group. The group made television appearances throughout the 1960s including Hootenanny Show, Barn Dance and Hullabaloo. They established a substantial audience and played concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and the Royal Festival Hall and at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964. In 1965, their version of Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" reached No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart. The group found two new members in 1977 when Ian's sister Lorna separated from her husband Brian Clark, who had been a singer and guitarist in the group since 1963. These two were Aiden Forde and Colin Tommis. The band continued to perform across Britain and in Scandinavia, appearing several times on BBC Radio 2 shows and Pebble Mill at One. Adam's Rib, an album of Campbell's songs, was re-recorded in Copenhagen with guest musicians in 1979. Mike Hadley and Andy Smith continued to play with them and Neil Cox joined for their tour of North America. On 8 February 2012, at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in Salford, Campbell received the 'Good Tradition' Award, presented by Stuart Maconie, for Campbell's outstanding contribution to folk music over five decades. He died later that year, on 24 November 2012, from cancer. He was the father of UB40 musicians; Ali, Robin and Duncan Campbell, as well as folk singer David Campbell.

Background The Almost released their debut album, Southern Weather in 2007. On November 9, 2008, it was announced that the band had parted ways with drummer Kenny Bozich. Later that month, the band released a holiday-themed EP, No Gift to Bring. Recording On April 29, 2009, the band arrived at Dark Horse Recording studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The recording process was documented with tweets, a live Stickam stream, and blogs. Like the band's debut Southern Weather, Monster Monster was produced by Aaron Sprinkle. Due to the band's lack of a drummer at the time, lead singer Aaron Gillespie played drums for the record. After the recording and mastering of the record, Gillespie stated, \\"This now feels like a real band. Everyone gave up a piece of his own agenda for the good of the final result. And that's how you end up with something special. They supplied the bricks and we built this house together.\\" On May 7, a studio update was posted online, followed by another on May 26. Release The first single from the album is \\"Hands\\" and it was released onto radio stations October 2, 2009, and it has cracked the Top 5 on the Christian Rock charts.

She is a professor in the departments of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, Neurology, and Pathology, and has a joint appointment in molecular biology and genetics. Her molecular biology and virology research examines lentiviruses and how they cause neurological diseases. Training and career Clements earned a PhD in biochemistry from the University of Maryland. She pursued post-doctoral work at Johns Hopkins during the 1970s, working first with Bernard Weiss and then with Opendra \\"Bill\\" Narayan and Richard T. Johnson. Along with Diane Griffin and others, Clements was one of several trainees of Johnson who went on to notable academic careers at Johns Hopkins. Clements became a faculty member at Johns Hopkins in 1978 as an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology and became a full professor in 1990, the 24th woman to achieve this rank at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Clements joined the Division of Comparative Medicine in 1988 and headed its retrovirus laboratory from 1992. Clements successfully convinced the school to elevate the division to department-level status, and in 2002 became the first director of the new department, later renamed the Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology. In 2000, Clements was appointed vice dean for the School of Medicine, taking over the duties of Catherine D. DeAngelis, who had left Johns Hopkins to become the first woman editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Clements stepped down as director of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology in 2008. She was succeeded by Chris Zink, a longtime colleague of Clements. Research Clements has conducted and led research into numerous viruses, concentrating on the animal lentiviruses. Lentiviruses are a complex type of retroviruses, and include the human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2. Clements was the first to characterize the complex genome of the lentiviruses, describing the genomic structure of visna virus, a lentivirus of sheep. She performed similar work with caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), a closely related virus of goats. With the discovery of AIDS and its cause, HIV, Clements' work took on a new dimension of relevance. In 1985, she published an article with HIV co- discoverer Robert Gallo and others describing the relationship of HIV to visna virus. This article helped to establish HIV as a lentivirus, not a leukemia virus as was originally thought. At the time, the origin of HIV was unknown, and Clements' work presented the possibility that HIV could have been transferred to humans from animals. Later, it was found that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains from chimpanzee and monkey hosts were the likely progenitors of HIV. In addition to her work with visna and CAEV, Clements has conducted extensive research into SIV and HIV. Clements and her laboratory have published over 160 scientific articles. Alongside collaborators including Chris Zink, Joseph L. Mankowski, and Kenneth Witwer, Clements has investigated the innate immune response to retrovirus infection in an animal model of HIV encephalitis. Her recent work includes the use of minocycline, a common antibiotic often used against acne, to protect against viral encephalitis\\"Common Antibiotic May Fight HIV Brain Disease\\" Miranda Hitti, WebMD, April 26, 2005 on: foxnews.com and slow viral replication.\\"Acne Drug May Help in the Fight Against AIDS\\" Randy Dotinga, Business Week, March 18, 2010. With Zink, Mankowski and HIV researchers Joel Blankson and Bob Siliciano, Clements has also developed a model of highly active antiretroviral therapy to study viral reservoirs: where HIV conceals itself in the body. Advocacy Clements has advocated and fostered the creation of opportunities and supportive environments for women in academia. She is a member of the steering committee of the Johns Hopkins Women's Leadership Council. In 2005, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine celebrated the promotion of the 100th woman to the rank of full professor in a ceremony organized by Clements and others at Johns Hopkins. The event was entitled \\"The Legacy of Mary Elizabeth Garrett, 100 Women Professors at Johns Hopkins Medicine\\" to honor the woman whose financial gift allowed the school of medicine to begin its first cohort of medical students in 1893. Garrett herself had stressed the importance of equal opportunity in medical education, specifying that the school must allow women and men alike to seek admission and \\"prizes, dignities or honor that are awarded by competitive examination, or regarded as rewards of merit.\\" References Category:American women biologists Category:American academic administrators Category:American virologists Category:Living people Category:University of Maryland, College Park alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:Women academic administrators ","title":"Janice E.

He was born Patrick Dunbar and was the son of a German naval officer. After his father’s death, his mother remarried to Richard von Kalckreuth in 1931. Richard von Kalckreuth adopted Patrick and despite being in his 30s, he changed his last name. Thus, early works of von Kalckreuth are signed under the name Patrick Dunbar whereas his paintings after 1931, are signed under the name Kalckreuth. After a brief career as a seaman, von Kalckreuth (at that time Dunbar) enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin and studied with the German painter Hugo Schnars-Alguist. Von Kalckreuth lived in both Düsseldorf and Berlin, but frequently spent summers along the North Sea in Cuxhaven. His works generally feature scenes from the North Sea, both scenes of waves crashing along beaches and ships at sea. Von Kalckreuth’s early works primarily of ships at sea are heavily influenced by Schnars-Alguist. Later in his career, he focused more on the sea itself, frequently painting beautiful seascapes highlighted by crashing waves and sunsets. Considered a master maritime painter, his paintings are displayed in several museums and galleries in Hamburg and in the North of Germany including the Historiches Museum located in Bremerhaven, Germany.

Launched in 1980, it was used for weather forecasting in the United States, and later in Europe. Following its retirement it became the first satellite to be sent into a graveyard orbit. Limited lifespan Launch of GOES-D on a Delta 3914 GOES-4 was built by Hughes Space and Communications, and was based around the HS-371 satellite bus. At launch it had a mass of , with an expected operational lifespan of around seven years. It was the first HS-371 based GOES satellite. Launch and orbit GOES-D was launched using a Delta 3914 carrier rocket flying from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 22:27 GMT on 9 September 1980. The launch successfully placed GOES-D into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, from which it raised itself to geostationary orbit by means of an onboard Star-27 apogee motor. Its insertion into geostationary orbit occurred at 12:00 on 11 September. Following its insertion into geostationary orbit, GOES-4 was positioned at 98° West. In 1981, it was moved to 135° West, where it remained until 1983 when it was moved to 139° West (1983–1984). In 1985 it was repositioned at 10° West, and later 44° West, where it provided coverage of Europe for EUMETSAT following the failure of the Meteosat-2 spacecraft. Graveyard orbit Following the end of its operations over Europe, GOES-4 was retired from service. It became the first spacecraft to be raised out of geosynchronous orbit, into a graveyard orbit for disposal. This was accomplished on 9 November 1988, using remaining propellent in the satellite's station-keeping thrusters.

Early life At 4 years of age, Manoel spent months in a hospital, recovering from recurrent threats of pneumonia and similar diseases, that his body suffered. His father saw in swimming the salvation of that drama. Before completing eleven years old, in early 1950, Manoel was studying in Rio Claro, in the Gymnasium Koelle, a German college. The boy found himself away from his family, which he saw only on holidays and \\"holy week\\", when he took the train to the western state. There in Rio Claro, the rigid routine of the college, Manoel fits well with the swimming program. In a 20-meter pool, under the guidance of Bruno Buch, his first master, he began to train, compete and make the team gym. The strongest swimmer of the group was a boy three years older than Manoel, named João Gonçalves Filho, future champion and South American record holder in the backstroke and an athlete in various sports, who participated in various Olympic Games. International career 1955–60 In 1955, Manoel dos Santos approached the national top. He swam backstroke, and his training was more focused in this style. In the 100-meter freestyle, Brazil was in a time of transition in national leadership. The top three sprinters in the country at the turn of the decade and early '50s (Aram Boghossian, Sérgio Rodrigues and Plauto Guimarães) had retired. Paulo Catunda and Haroldo Lara were the fastest at this time. Lara was the best swimmer in the country until 1957, when he retired, moved to Italy and became an opera singer. In March 1955, at age 16, Manoel was summoned to his first international competition, the II Pan American Games in Mexico City. At this time, athletes were still amateurs. In Mexico, after a trip into a military aircraft, a DC-3, which lasted four days, with overnight in Belém, Trinidad and Tobago and Cuba, Manoel competed very poorly. His main memory of the tournament was the moment he left desolate of proof, fell on a nearby heating pool and pretending to be loosening up, cried a lot, solitude, until the last tear is lost hidden in the middle of chlorine. At the 1955 Pan American Games in Mexico City, he finished 4th in the 4 × 100-metre medley. The following year, on February 56, in Viña del Mar, Chile, was the thirteenth edition of the South American Swimming Championships. At the previous twelve, Brazil defeated Argentina only once, in the same Viña del Mar, in 1941. Manoel dos Santos ranked fifth in the final of the 100-metre freestyle, and Haroldo Lara took the fourth position. In the 200-metre backstroke, Manoel was fourth and the race was won by his compatriot João Gonçalves. In the 4x100-metre freestyle relay, the competition had a spectacular end. Peru team was the gold medalist, with a time of 3:59.7, a championship record. A tenth of a second ago, silver medalist, arrived Brazil. The Argentines came in third, nine-tenths of a second behind Brazil. The Brazilian relay team had Haroldo Lara, Manuel dos Santos, João Gonçalves and Aristarco de Oliveira. In partial takes, Manoel was the fastest of the four. He stated that, at that moment, he realized that his specialty and future were the 100-metre freestyle, and the backstroke was just a byproduct. This flare, this awareness of where his true talent lay resulted in a short time, a leap of improvement. As for the South American, as expected, porteños took the title again. In November 1956, at the new pool of CR Vasco da Gama, Manoel dos Santos failed to get Olympic qualification, by two tenths of a second. In 1957, finishing the secondary school in Rio Claro, Manoel dos Santos moved to Santos, São Paulo. The choice of the new city was due to Minoru Hirano, his new coach, teacher, and almost a father. Hirano entered to swimming by the paths of the translation service, carried out during the stay of the \\"Flying Fish\\" in Brazil in 1950. Hirano got much swimming knowledge, monitoring and deciphering the Japanese Olympians and world record holders. In the late 50s, the footage of the training, even in Brazil, began to increase substantially. Hirano was against the current. He did Manoel swim a thousand meters and then working leg, positioning stroke, angle etc. chin, and finished with a half dozen shots of 25m. Often he could not attend the training, and Manoel came alone to the session with a little paper in hand, or the sequence decorated into his head. In December 1957, Manoel broke the Brazilian record of Haroldo Lara, and the South American record of Argentine Pedro Galvao in Santos, on 25 meter pool (still valid in that year), with a time of 56.5. Further, in February 1958, was held the South American Championships in Montevideo. For the first time in the history of the tournament, the winner of the 100-metre freestyle won the race handily, not in the beat of hand, but two and a half seconds ahead of, or fifteen feet away - Manoel dos Santos. The only Brazilian besides Armando Freitas in 1939, to win the gold. The silver medal went to nearly invincible Ismael Martínez Merino, Peruvian three times champion in 52, 54 and 56. The Manoel's time in qualifying, 56.6, represented new South American record, as from 1958, all international federations officiated the rule of consider valid only records obtained in 50 meter pool. The following year, came the first trip to the United States. The beds in the Olympic village assembled at the University of Chicago, were those of American soft mattress, strange and uncomfortable for someone who grew up sleeping on a hard bed of boarding school. The body aching, and barely slept, and back that do not reared more, affected the balance of swimming. Manoel dos Santos, the great hope of the Brazilian Swimming to win a medal at the Pan American Games in 1959, got only a fourth place in the 100-metre freestyle, swimming above the 58s, when expectations revolved around the 56s. The Manoel's curriculum, regarding Pans, was forever beyond the means of his talent. After Mexico 55 and Chicago 59, Manoel not arrive until São Paulo 63. At the 1959 Pan American Games, in Chicago, he finished 4th in the 100-metre freestyle. He also swam the 4 × 100-metre medley. In February 1960, Santos went to the South American Championship in Cali, Colombia. In the altitude, his times were not very good. But Manoel dos Santos fulfilled its role fairly, taking the gold in the 100m freestyle and leading the Brazilian relays to win two golds and a silver. The battle against the Argentines was very fierce, both the female and the male. In the end, Brazil won the first championship in history. In 1960, Manoel dos Santos was swimmer of the Pinheiros. But he continued to follow the guidelines determined by your Hirano technician, from Santos. He used the Pinheiros pool, and sometimes the Corinthians pool, during the summer and in the winter, down the hill and gave their strokes in the Clube de Regatas Internacional. In July 60, during the pre-Olympic final preparations, in Rio de Janeiro, Manoel convincingly broke his South American record of the 100-metre freestyle, with a time of 55.6. This achievement has positioned him as a strong competitor to the Olympic medal in Rome. 1960 Summer Olympics On his way to the 1960 Olympics dos Santos contracted tonsillitis during the Brazilian teams stop in Portugal. He was put on antibiotics and had only a few days to recover before the heats of the 100-metre freestyle, the traditional opening race of the Olympic program at that time. In Rome, dos Santos won his heat with a time of 56.3, the third-equal best time overall. Twenty-four swimmers qualified for the semi-finals with the slowest qualifier at 58.2. dos Santos also won his semi-final, with his time of 56.3 being the fourth fastest, ranking behind Americans Lance Larson and Bruce Hunter and Australian John Devitt, whose times were 55.5, 55.7 and 55.8, respectively. The eighth and final qualifier for the final was Canadian Dick Pound, later head of the World Anti-Doping Agency. In the final the next day dos Santos led at the turn but eventually finished third in a time of 55.4, new South American record, to claim the bronze medal. The awarding of the gold medal to Devitt ahead of Larson remains one of the most troubled decisions in the history of Olympic swimming. 1961 and later career At the Brazilian Championship in 1961 dos Santos took silver in the 100-metre freestyle with a time of 57.8, a second behind the winner, Athos de Oliveira. Later the same year, at the Japanese Championships in Tokyo, he won his heat, semi-final and final, with times of 55.1, 55.2 and 55.3, respectively. His time of 55.1 was a new South American record. He lowered the South American record by another tenth of a second, to 55.0, at a meeting in Nagoya. At the American championships in Los Angeles on August 18, 1961, dos Santos was fourth in the race which saw American Steve Clark break the world record with 54.4. On September 21, 1961, in Rio de Janeiro, alone in the swimming pool of Club de Regatas Guanabara, dos Santos set a new world record for the 100-metre freestyle with a time of 53.6 seconds. dos Dantos was the South American champion for eleven years between 1958 and 1969.

Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009. The supply depends primarily on the number of graduates of medical schools in a country or jurisdiction, but also on the number who continue to practice medicine as a career path and who remain in their country of origin. The number of physicians needed in a given context depends on several different factors, including the demographics and epidemiology of the local population, the numbers and types of other health care practitioners working in the system, as well as the policies and goals in place of the health care system.World Health Organization. Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections. Geneva, 2010. If more physicians are trained than needed, then supply exceeds demand; if too few physicians are trained and retained, then some people may have difficulty accessing health care services. A physician shortage is a situation in which there are not enough physicians to treat all patients in need of medical care. This can be observed at the level of a given health care facility, a province/state, a country, or worldwide. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other health workers worldwide,World Health Organization. The world health report 2006: working together for health. Geneva, 2006. especially in many developing countries. Developing nations often have physician shortages due to limited numbers and capacity of medical schools and because of international migration: physicians can usually earn much more money and enjoy better working conditions in other countries. Many developed countries also report doctor shortages, and this traditionally happened in rural and other underserved areas. Reports as recent as January 2019 show that high growth areas like Phoenix, Arizona are experiencing shortages. Shortages exist and are growing in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Several causes of the current and anticipated shortages have been suggested; however, not everyone agrees that there is a true physician shortage, at least not in the United States. On the KevinMD medical news blog, for example, it has been argued that inefficiencies introduced into the healthcare system, often driven by government initiatives, have reduced the number of patients physicians can see; by forcing physicians to spend much of their time on data entry and public health issues, these initiatives have limited the physicians' time available for direct patient care. Determinants Economic theory and trends Patients queue to see a doctor in South Sudan Anything that changes the number of available physicians or the demand for their services affects the supply and demand balance. If the number of physicians is decreased, or the demand for their services increases, then an under-supply or shortage can result. If the number of physicians increases, or demand for their services decreases, then an over-supply can result. Substitution factors can significantly affect the production of physician services and the availability of physicians to see more patients. For example, an accountant can replace some of the financial responsibilities for a physician who owns his or her own practice, allowing for more time to treat patients. Disposable supplies can substitute for labor and capital (the time and equipment needed to sterilize instruments). Sound record keeping by physicians can substitute for legal services by avoiding malpractice suits. However, the extent of substitution of physician production is limited by technical and legal factors. Technology cannot replace all skills possessed by physicians, such as surgical skill sets. Legal factors can include only allowing licensed physicians to perform surgeries, but nurses or doctors administering other surgical care.Charles Phelps, Health Economics (4th edition), (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 2010 Demand of physicians is also dependent on a country's economic status. Especially in developing nations, health care spending is closely related to growth of their Gross domestic product (GDP). Theoretically, as GDP increases, the health care labor force expands and in turn, physician supply also increases. However, developing countries face additional challenges in retaining competent physicians to higher-income countries such as the United States, Australia, and Canada. Emigration of physicians from lower-income and developing countries contribute to Brain drain, creating issues on maintaining sufficient physician supply. However, higher-income countries can also experience an outflow of physicians who decide to return to their naturalized countries after receiving extensive education and training, without ever benefiting from their gained medical knowledge and skill set. Number of physicians trained Increasing the number of students enrolled in existing medical schools is one way to address physician shortage, or increasing the number of schools, but other factors may also play a role. Becoming a physician requires either several years of training beyond undergraduate education, or a professional undergraduate degree with a duration longer than that of a typical undergraduate degree. Consequently, physician supply is affected by the number of students eligible for medical training. Students that do not finish earlier levels of education, including high school dropouts and in some places those that leave university without an undergraduate or associate degree, do not qualify for entrance to medical school. The more people that fail to complete the prerequisites, the fewer people become eligible for training as physicians. In most countries, the number of placements for students in medical schools and clinical internships is limited, typically according to the number of teachers and other resources, including the amount of funding provided by governments. In many countries that do not charge tuition payments to prospective physicians, public funding is the only significant limitation on the number of physicians trained. In the United States, the American Medical Association says that federal funding is the most important limitation in the supply of physicians. The high cost of tuition combined with the cost of supporting oneself during medical school discourages some people from enrolling to become a physician. Limited scholarships and financial aid to medical students may exacerbate this problem, while low expected pay for practicing physicians in some countries may convince some that the cost is not appropriate. It has been speculated that politics and social conditions can sometimes motivate medical student placements. For example, racial quotas have been cited in some places as preventing some people from enrolling in medical school. Racial discrimination and gender discrimination, either overt or disguised, have also been cited as resulting in people being denied the opportunity to train as a physician on the basis of their race or gender. Number of physicians working Once trained, the current supply of physicians can be affected by the number of those who continue to practice this profession. The number of working physicians can be affected by: *The number of medical school graduates who: **Choose to practice as a physician for their career – for example, some might choose instead to work in medical research, public policy or other areas where medical expertise is required; or they may choose a job where no medical knowledge is required. **Fail to obtain or re-qualify for their license or other professional requirements for legal practice. **Are unable to find work of their choice – for example, studies in Mexico have found high levels of unemployment among trained physicians in urban areas, even while large rural populations remain medically underserved. *The number of physicians who: **Exit the workforce, such as by retiring. **Migrate abroad for better economic and social conditions, also referred to as \\"Brain drain\\". **Work part-time - in particular, while the number working only part-time does not affect the overall number of physicians, it does affect the supply of physician services (e.g. in terms of full-time equivalents). Many physicians may retain their professional license while working part-time or after retiring; consequently, the reported number of active physicians is probably overstated in many jurisdictions. *Changes in the specialty balance – for example, in many countries, the balance is shifting away from medical students becoming general practitioners (GP) because of more attractive pay for medical specialists, leading to shortages of physicians for primary care. *Changes in the practice environment – for example, changing legal conditions have been cited in the US, Canada and elsewhere as inciting physician attrition, notably the adoption of laws that require doctors to refer for certain procedures (such as abortion or sex change) with which the doctors disagreed on moral or religious grounds.Lea Singh. New-look Inquisitions want to call doctors in for a little chat. Posted Wednesday, 1 October 2008. Demand for physician services The demand for physician services is influenced by the local job market (e.g. the number of job openings in local health care facilities), the demographics and epidemiology of the population being served, the nature of the health policies in place for health care delivery and financing in a jurisdiction, and also the international job market (e.g. increasing demand in other countries puts pressure on local competition). As of 2010, the WHO proposes a ratio of at least one primary care physician per 1000 people to sufficiently attend the basic needs of the population in a developed country. For example, population ageing has been attributed with increased demand for physician services in many countries, as more previously young and healthy people become older with increased likelihood of a variety of chronic medical conditions associated with ageing, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, and some types of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (U.S.) In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has expanded health insurance coverage and access to an estimated 32 million United States citizens, increasing the demand of physicians, especially primary care physicians, across the country. Expanded coverage is predicted to increase the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million by 2019. Assuming stable levels of physicians’ productivity, between 4,307 and 6,940 additional primary care physicians would be needed to accommodate this increase. The PPACA may have also affected the supply of Medicaid physicians. Incentives and higher reimbursement rates may have increased the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients leading up to 2014. With the expansion of Medicaid and a decrease in incentives and reimbursement rates in 2014, the supply of physicians in Medicaid may drop substantially, fluctuating the supply of Medicaid physicians. A study examining variation between states in 2005 showed that average time for Medicaid reimbursements was directly correlated with Medicaid participation, and physicians in states with faster reimbursement times had a higher probability of accepting new Medicaid patients.http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/1/w17.full.pdf+html Effects of physician shortage Nations identified with critical shortages of physicians and other health care workers Physician shortages have been linked to a number of effects, including: *Lower quantity of medical care for patients, thereby limiting the ability of health systems to meet primary health care goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals. *Lower quality of medical care for patients, due to shorter doctor visits. *Increased workload and too many patients per doctor resulting in overworked and sleep-deprived doctors, thereby compromising patient safety.Shortage pushes doctors to limit.

Maternity deserts There are thousands of women in the United States that live in counties that do not have obstetrical care available. Arizona has two counties where there is no care available for women who are pregnant. Awareness to the lack of access to care is increasing in Arizona as it looks like the Phoenix area is heading toward a maternity desert. From 2009 to 2019 there has been a twelve percent reduction in obstetricians delivering babies in Arizona while the general population has grown. Proposed solutions A number of solutions, including short-term fixes and long-term solutions, have been proposed to address physician shortages. Some have been tested and applied in national health workforce policies and plans, while others remain subject to ongoing debate. *Increase the number of medical graduates through increased recruitment of minority students domestically, as well as intensified recruitment of foreign-trained graduates (also known as International Medical Graduates or IMGs). *Increase the number of medical schools and classroom sizes. *To address physician shortages in rural areas, develop, organize, and locate medical schools to increase the propensity of physicians entering rural practice. Accepting medical school applicants from rural areas can also increase the proportion of rural physicians. *To address physician shortages in high population growth areas in the United States unfreeze the 1996 Graduate Medical Education (GME) freeze/cap instituted by Congress. *Higher medical school enrollment limits.http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts- foresee-doctor-shortage *Loosen the requirements for entry to medical school, such as eliminating the need for a pre-med bachelor's degree as required in some jurisdictions, thereby making the education path more attractive for potential students. *Reduce the costs for students to attend medical school, such as through subsidies for (free or reduced) school tuition and more financial aid. *Legislate tuition-increase caps for medical schools. *Increase the role of the National Health Service Corps, which help provide debt-relief opportunities for primary care physicians. *Improve the political, social and economic conditions in developing countries to prevent brain drain, including fewer wars and conflicts. *Make better use of other categories of health care professionals, including more Osteopathic Physicians (DOs), nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical officers, community health workers, and others.World Health Organization.

Global view In the US alone, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) estimates a shortage of 91,500 physicians by 2020 and up to 130,600 by the year 2025. However, a bias would clearly exist in their estimates as expanding medical education serves the direct financial needs of the AAMC. As previously mentioned, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other health workers worldwide. The WHO produced a list of countries with a “Human Resources for Health crisis”. In these countries, there are only 1.13 doctors for every 1,000 people, while in the United States, there are approximately 2.5 doctors for every 1,000 people. One quarter of physicians practicing in the United States are from foreign countries. Thousands of foreign doctors come to practice in the United States each year while only a few hundred doctors from the United States leave to practice in foreign countries even short- term.http://www.amednews.com/article/20090720/business/307209994/4/ There are various organizations that assist United States physicians and others in serving internationally. These organizations may be filling temporary or permanent positions. Two temporary agencies are Global Medical Staffing and VISTA staffing. A locum doctor will serve in the temporary absence of another physician. These positions are typically 1-year placements but can vary by location, specialty, and other factors. Agencies that attempt to provide international aid in various ways often have a strong medical component. Some of these organizations helping to provide medical care internationally include Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), Mercy Ships, the US Peace Corps, and International Medical Corps. Additionally, smaller non-profits that work regionally around the world have also implemented task-shifting strategies in order to increase impact. Non profits, such as the MINDS Foundation educated community health workers or teachers to perform simple medicinal tasks, thereby freeing up health professionals to focus on more pressing concerns.

Housman at University College, London: the election of 1892 by P. G. Naiditch The classical scholars J. E. B. Mayor and J. E. Sandys spoke in high regard of Wyse's criticism of the newly discovered treatise by Aristotle on the Constitution of Athens which (in Sandy's words) \\"give abundant proof not only of his acumen as a textual critic, but also of profound acquaintance with Greek History and Constitutional Antiquities.\\" In 1904, the year of his retirement from Trinity due to ill health,Oxford DNB accessed 10 Sept 2009 Wyse published his magnum opus, a Greek text and commentary on the speeches of Isaeus.The Speeches of Isaeus Cambridge University Press 1904 Wyse rated Isaeus as \\"an unscrupulous falsifier of law and fact in the service of clients whose claims to the estates they contested were, without exception, fraudulent\\"; this view is, however, increasingly viewed as unjust by more modern scholars.Review of Stefano Ferrucci (ed.)

In the mid 1940s it spent nearly six months on the Country & Western charts. It was subsequently recorded by several pop singers. Early versions The first recording of \\"Jealous Heart\\" was made in 1944 by its composer Jenny Lou Carson. That 20 September Tex Ritter recorded the song: his version spent 23 weeks on the C&W; chart peaking at No. 2. The song had its first impact in the Pop field via a recording by Al Morgan, a Chicago-based vocalist/pianist whose version of \\"Jealous Heart\\" released September 1949 was on the hit parade for six months spending ten weeks in the Top 5. This Al Morgan is not to be confused with the bassist of the same name. Also in 1949 Ivory Joe Hunter had an R&B; hit with \\"Jealous Heart\\"; Hunter's version reached No. 2 R&B; that December. \\"Jealous Heart\\" - which Ernest Tubb had recorded in 1945 - was also recorded in 1949 by C&W; singers Bill Owens and Kenny Roberts while Pop versions were cut by Bill Lawrence, Jan Garber & His Orchestra (vocal by Bob Grabeau) and Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra (vocal by Johnny Thompson). British duo the Tanner Sisters - Frances and Stella - recorded \\"Jealous Heart\\" in London 14 October 1949; this version - which retained the lyrics as recorded by Tex Ritter and Al Morgan rather than gender-adjusting them - was released by EMI as HMV#9846 with \\"Hop Scotch Polka\\" as the flip. This duo should not to be confused with the American female trio of the same name. Lale Andersen enjoyed a European comeback in 1952 with a German-language version of \\"Jealous Heart\\" entitled \\"Blaue Nacht am Hafen\\": Andersen wrote the German lyrics herself under the name Nicola Wilke. Early revivals In the fall of 1958 three recordings of \\"Jealous Heart\\" were released with the version by Tab Hunter reaching No. 62 on the Billboard Hot 100 besting the Fontane Sisters' version (#94) and also the version by Les Paul and Mary Ford which did not chart. \\"Jealous Heart\\" was also a single for Bobby Edwards in 1959. In the UK the Vernons Girls and Ottilie Patterson had non-charting single versions of \\"Jealous Heart\\" in respectively 1959 and 1963 before the version by Irish act the Cadets with Eileen Reid reached No. 42 on the UK Top 50 dated 3 June 1965. After debuting on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles chart dated 1 November 1958, Tab Hunter's \\"Jealous Heart\\" was ranked in tandem with the Fontane Sisters' version on the chart dated 8 November and with the Fontane Sisters and Les Paul & Mary Ford versions on the charts dated 15 November and 22 November: on 22 November the joint position assigned the three versions was No. 71. On its subsequent charts Cash Box only listed the Tab Hunter version which peaked at No. 60. Connie Francis version Connie Francis recorded \\"Jealous Heart\\" 12 August 1965 in Hollywood CA in a session produced by Jesse Kaye with Ernie Freeman conducting. Although Francis had had early hits with remakes of traditional Pop songs by the mid-60s she was attempting (with sparse success) to update her sound - the precedent and subsequent releases to her \\"Jealous Heart\\" were recorded with Petula Clark's producer Tony Hatch - and \\"Jealous Heart\\" was an emphatic throwback to her original hit sound. The track also served as title cut for an album which was largely a nostalgia concept album heavily featuring standards: \\"Everything I Have Is Yours,\\" \\"If You Ever Change Your Mind,\\" \\"My Foolish Heart\\" and \\"Nevertheless\\" as well as the 1956 hit ballad \\"Ivory Tower.\\" Released that November, Francis' \\"Jealous Heart\\" peaked at No. 47 in January 1966: it was ranked substantially higher in both Cash Box and Record World at respectively No. 29 and No. 25. In all three trades Francis never had another single reach the Top 60. Her version of \\"Jealous Heart\\" was also her last Easy Listening Top 10 hit at No. 10. \\"Jealous Heart\\" was the last Connie Francis single to rank on the UK charts reaching No. 44 in January 1966. Also in early 1966 Francis' \\"Jealous Heart\\" reached No. 16 in Canada and No. 54 in Australia. Spanish version \\"Jealous Heart\\" has become a standard of Latin music via a Spanish language rendering by Mexican lyricist Mario Molina Montes entitled \\"Celoso\\" (\\"jealous\\"). Recorded in Nashville in March 1966 by Trio Los Panchos led by Johnny Albino, \\"Celoso\\" entered the Top Ten in Mexico in April 1967 and - ranked in tandem with a cover by Marco Antonio Muñiz - the track reached No. 1 that summer spending five months in the Top Ten. In addition the Trio Los Panchos version reached No. 2 - in a tandem ranking with covers by José Feliciano and Oleo Guillot - in Argentina that autumn when the Muñiz version reached No. 1 in Puerto Rico. \\"Celoso\\" has also been recorded by Galy Galeano, Ezequiel Peña, José Luis Rodríguez and Sergio Vega. Later in 1981 it was recorded another version by Jhensen (Felix Caraballo Leonidas), in his album Cuando te Sientas Sola under Peer Music. Johnny Rodriguez recorded a version of \\"Jealous Heart\\" in 1972 on the Mercury label. Maná recorded \\"Celoso\\" for the soundtrack of the 1995 Gregory Nava movie My Family (Mi Familia). Other versions In 1988 Big Tom reached No. 9 on the Irish charts with \\"Jealous Heart\\" - actually a four track EP which included the title song. Other versions of the song include those by Bing Crosby (for his 1965 album Bing Crosby Sings the Great Country Hits), Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Teresa Brewer, Ann Breen, Carl Butler, Eddy Duchin, Margot Eskens (as \\"Blaue Nacht am Hafen\\"), Tennessee Ernie Ford, Bill Haley, Wanda Jackson, Sven Arefeldt (as \\"Hjärtats röst\\"), Jussi & Kantri Boys (as \\"Sydämein, Niin Mustasukkainen\\"), Jerry Lee Lewis, Hank Locklin, Lolita (as \\"Blaue Nacht am Hafen\\"), Bob Luman, Loretta Lynn, Al Martino, Jaye P.

Early life and RAFVR Born in Hammersmith, Sydney was educated at Hurstpierpoint College. In July 1937, he joined the recently formed Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and learnt to fly at weekends. At the outbreak of war in September 1939, he was called up for regular service and completed his pilot training. He was commissioned as a pilot officer on 21 October 1940, with seniority from 9 August 1940.London Gazette He joined No 608 Squadron attached to Coastal Command flying Avro Ansons on anti-submarine and convoy escort operations. At the end of 1940, he volunteered to join No 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU) flying Spitfires. He was mentioned in despatches on 11 June 1942London Gazette and promoted to flight lieutenant on 21 October 1942, with seniority from 9 August 1942.London Gazette Dowse was shot down on 15 August 1941 while on a reconnaissance mission to photograph the German battleships and at Brest.RAF Coastal Command Losses by Ross McNeill He was wounded in the leg and quickly captured by the Germans, becoming a prisoner of war. Prisoner of war Early escape attempts His first escape attempt came on 1 December 1941, when he was recovering from the leg wound sustained when he was shot down. He escaped from a hospital at Stadtroda in Thuringia. However, Dowse was recaptured three days later attempting to cross the Dutch-German border.London Gazette His next attempt was from Stalag IX-C at Bad Sulza on 21 January 1942. He exchanged identities with a Canadian POW and joined a work party. He managed to slip away unnoticed when outside the camp. After travelling some distance by train to Werwitz, he continued on foot, through deep snow, towards the German-Belgian frontier where he was re-captured five days later, suffering from extreme exhaustion and exposure.Wire and Worse by Charles Rollings page 207 Following a brief period in hospital, he was transferred to Oflag VI-B at Warburg. At Warburg, he participated in the excavation of an escape tunnel, which was completed on 18 April 1942. He, and 34 others (including the legless air ace, Douglas Bader, and Dowse's later escaping partner, Stanislaw Krol), prepared to escape. However, as the tunnel broke surface, it became clear that it was slightly too short, and the exit hole had emerged directly in the patrol path of a German sentry. Six RAF officers managed to escape, but, due to the proximity of the sentry, no one else, including Dowse, was able to do so.Wire and Worse by Charles Rollings page 212 Stalag Luft III In May 1942, Dowse was transferred to Stalag Luft III at Sagan with a batch of other RAF officers. Dowse's next escape attempt happened on 30 November 1942, when he and Flt Lt Stanisław 'Danny' Krol cut through the wire into the camp's central compound and crawled across that compound using blankets as camouflage. They were in the process of cutting the perimeter wire to get out when they were arrested and sentenced to 14 days' solitary confinement.AIR40/2645 Official Camp History – SL3(East) page 50 Dowse, who spoke some German, befriended a German corporal who worked alongside Dowse in the camp′s censor office. From this contact, Dowse was able to gain useful information and documents which aided the camp escape organisation. He was able to 'borrow' a genuine gate pass, which was copied by the camp's forgery department, and a copy was used on the delousing break mass escape in June 1943.The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III by Tim Carroll page 123 Through this same contact, Dowse was able to gain information about the German secret rocket establishment at Peenemünde. This information was passed on to British intelligence via secret codes written into POWs' letters home.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 153 Dowse also learnt that the Gestapo had liquidation plans for Roger Bushell if he were caught escaping again. Dowse warned Bushell, who chose to ignore the warning.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 169 The Great Escape During his time in the North Compound at Stalag Luft III, Dowse became involved with the construction of the three tunnels intended for a mass escape, masterminded by Roger Bushell, Harry Day and Canadian Wally Floody, who was instrumental in the tunnel′s design and construction. One tunnel, codenamed 'Harry' which Dowse had helped build, was completed in early 1944. On 24 March 1944, he took part in The Great Escape through tunnel 'Harry', escaping with Flt Lt Stanisław 'Danny' Krol. Dowse had drawn escape number 21, and was disguised as a Danish foreign worker, equipped with the appropriate (forged) documents and clothing provided by his 'contact'.The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III by Tim Carroll page 192 Dowse and Krol travelled mainly by foot towards the Polish border, but were recaptured just inside Germany on 6 April 1944. They were amongst the last escapers to be re-captured. Taken to the local Gestapo headquarters, they were interrogated, before being separated.AIR40/2645 Official Camp History – SL3(North) page 59 Dowse was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Stanisław 'Danny' Krol was among the 50 recaptured officers to be executed. Sachsenhausen concentration camp At Sachsenhausen, Dowse found himself with three fellow survivors of the 'Great Escape': (Harry Day, Johnnie Dodge and Bertram James). They were placed in Sonderlager A (Special Camp A) within the main camp. Here were housed a handful of other 'political' prisoners, including SOE agent Peter Churchill, two Russian generals, various other Russians, Poles, Italians and four British soldiers of Irish origin.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 193 Later, they were joined by British Commando Jack Churchill. Dowse and James almost immediately began another tunnel, which was kept secret from all non-British personnel. This was completed and used on the night of 23 September 1944, when Dowse, James, Day, Dodge and Jack Churchill escaped.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 210The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill page 236 Moonless Night by Bertrand James Dowse paired up with Day and they travelled by train into Berlin. However, they were recaptured the next day when hiding in a bombed out house in the Berlin suburb of Mahlsdorf.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 212 Placed in the death cells back at Sachsenhausen, all the escapers who had been re- captured were spared execution mainly thanks to Day's efforts under interrogation. In April 1945, after spending several months in solitary confinement Dowse, together with other prominent prisoners (Prominenten), was transferred to the Tyrol via concentration camps at Flossenburg and Dachau. He was awarded the Military Cross for his services as a POW. This award was published in the London Gazette on 16 August 1946. Later life Dowse served as an equerry at Buckingham Palace. For a number of years in the 1950s, at the time of the communist insurgency, he worked in Malaya as a rubber plantation manager in the Penang Settlement.Obituary in the Telegraph After the war, he also worked, possibly unwittingly, for a short time as a representative for Bernie Cornfeld's insurance fraud, \\"The Dover Plan\\", as well as other unsuccessful and/or dubious ventures. He lived mainly on his heroic stories from the war, which were a laissez passer in post-war society. He married three times, for the most part to women of some fortune, but was single at the time of his death. (He married Florence Marion Byers, daughter of wealthy businessman and Liberal, C. Charles Byers, then ran off, in 1968, with \\"Wings\\" Day's wife, to his former superior officer's eternal chagrin.) In retirement, Dowse divided his time between elegant homes in Chelsea and Monte Carlo. He returned to Stalag Luft III in March 1994 and March 2004 to mark the anniversaries of the Great Escape, and to commemorate his friends who did not survive.BBC News Obituary * The Telegraph * The Times * The Independent References External links * Imperial War Museum Interview Category:1918 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People educated at Hurstpierpoint College Category:British escapees Category:Participants in the Great Escape from Stalag Luft III Category:British World War II prisoners of war Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:English aviators Category:British World War II pilots Category:British World War II bomber pilots Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:Shot-down aviators Category:Sachsenhausen concentration camp survivors Category:People from Hammersmith ","title":"Sydney Dowse"},{"id":"23985967","text":"The Christian Open Door Church (Mission du Plein Évangile - Église Porte Ouverte Chrétienne [POC]) is a French Evangelical charismatic megachurch whose main place of worship is located in Mulhouse.

La Porte ouverte chrétienne, France, 2004, p. 59 Controversies In the 1990s, the church was criticized by former members, their families, anti-cult associations and by the Catholic Church. In 1993, the group \\"Religious Evolution and New Spiritualities\\" (\\"Évolution Religieuses et Nouvelles Spiritualités\\"), led by the Catholic Church, added to the criticisms. Then, in 1996, the anti-cult association CCMM, received the first complaints from former members. In 1999, Claude Omnibus, the husband of a deceased follower, accused the movement of having killed his wife after her refusal of an organ transplant, and created an association of victims named Association of Victims of the Christian Open Door (Association des Victimes de la Porte Ouverte Chrétienne, AVIPOC). He participated in many television programs to warn against the COD, and was supported by the ADFI and CCMM, two anti-cult associations (the CCMM asked the Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires to add the COD in the 1995 list of cults). The COD was described as \\"a dangerous cult\\" in a book by two journalists and in many press articles. Activities of the group that are criticized include anti-social speech, family breakdowns, false promises of healing which led to abandonment of medical treatments, theological deviances and financial disclosures. Meanwhile, the COD sought support from French Evangelical Association (Association Évangélique Française [AEF]) and unsuccessfully tried to integrate the Protestant Federation of France.Willaime, Amiotte-Suchet, 2004, pp. 128-63. Pastor Peterschmitt and members denied these accusations when they were interviewed in the media. The pastor said his church was a victim of religious discrimination. Two sociologists who studied this church in 2002 rejected these criticisms and said in their conclusion that any group might experience deviances.Willaime, Amiotte-Suchet, 2004, pp. 163-76.  COVID-19  A gathering organised by the church in mid-February 2020 in Mulhouse and attended by about 2,000 faithful became a significant event in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across France. On 3 March, seven local participants had tested positive for the virus; five returnees from the Mulhouse event were confirmed positive in French Guiana on 4 March. On 5 March a retired couple from Lot-et-Garonne and another person from Deux-Sèvres who had attended the same gathering were declared positive for the disease; five new cases from this cluster were registered in Corsica, and three more in Normandy the same day. On 6 March, it was announced that 81 cases had been detected in the previous 24 hours in Mulhouse. The department of Haut Rhin, in which Mulhouse is situated, imposed strict limits on the gatherings; all schools were closed henceforth. Physical church services were suspended in favour of internet worship. During the spring of 2020, the church received blame for the spread of the virus in France, and its pastor and other members reported receiving threats.https://www.franceinter.fr/societe/coronavirus-les-membres-de-l- eglise-evangelique-de-mulhouse-toujours-sous-la-pression-des-menaces However, a May 2020 study by a doctor at the Albert-Schweitzer hospital in Colmar suggested that the impact of the church meeting had been overstated, reporting that the virus had been present in the region since November 2019, and that the Church was \\"only one link in the chain of virus transmission\\".

History  The town of Amroha is home to one of the oldest Naqvi Sadat settlements in India. Naqvis in Amroha arrived from Wasit, Iraq and have resided in the town of Amroha since A.D. 1190.A Socio-Intellectual History of the Ithna ashari Shia in India by S A Rizvi The Sadaat Amroha belong mainly to the Naqvi sub-group, because they are descendants of the Sufi saint Syed Sharfuddin Shah Wilayat (a true 9th direct descendant of Imam Ali Al-Naqi), who was a highly respected religious figure in Wasit, Iraq, and later in India during the early ages of Islam in the South Asia and the khalifa of Imam Suhrawardi. The majority of Amrohvie Sadaat are Naqvi, predominately of Shia sects. According to the 1901 Census of India, the main sub-division of the Sayyid was the Husseini and Naqvi.  Syed Hussain Sharfuddin Shah Wilayat Naqvi  Syed Hussain Sharfuddin Shah Wilayat Naqvi () was a prominent 13th-century Sufi or Makhdoom. He is the ninth descendant of Imam Ali al-Naqi al-Hadi. Syed Husain Sharfuddin Naqvi \\"Shah Wilayat\\" was a son of Syed Ali Buzurg Wasiti. His ancestor migrated from Al-Wasit \\"Iraq\\" to Bukhara \\"Uzbekistan\\", his family re-migrated to Sahudra (Punjab) near Uch Sherif. He was born in 1255 AD in Sahudra.(ancient city of Punjab) He married to his maternal cousin named Fatimatut Tahira, she was a daughter of Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari. Makhdoom Jahaniyan Jahangasht was nephew of Dadi Fatimatut Tahira. His father, Syed Ahmed Kabir, was the youngest son of Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari. Dada Shah Wilayat was a Sufi Saint of Sisila-e- Suhrawardiyya & achieved the highly honored designation of \\"Shah Wilayat\\". He was appointed to Amroha, India by his Sisila for preaching Shariat, Tariqat & Haqiqat. Syed Hussain Sharfuddin Shah Wilayat Naqvi was the ancestor of Syed Muhammad Mir Ali Naqvi (known as Mir Adal) was the Chief justice of the court of Akbar the Great. He served on the court from 1579–1581. He was known as \\"Mir Adal\\"; \\"Adal\\" means in equitableness Urdu. Syed Muhammad Mir was also governor of Sindh. Syed Hussain Sharfuddin Shah Wilayat Naqvi was also the ancestor of Mir Saiyyed Dost Ali Naqvi who fought with exemplary bravery in the Third Battle of Panipat along with the Nawab of Najibabad (against the Marathas) and almost died in action. Local legend says that the animals who live in his mazar (shrine), especially scorpions, never harm humans.  Present circumstances  The Sadaat Amroha are divided among those that remained in India and those that emigrated to Pakistan. The Anjuman Sadaat Amroha is the community's main organization. They joined the South Asian diaspora, with communities in North America. The Sadaat Amroha speak Urdu and rarely use dialects such as Khari boli.

Western Ghats, from Mahableshwar southwards, and hill-country of Ceylon.  Shell description  The shell is internal, solid, ovate, convex above, flatly concave beneath, with a small apex, not coiled, lying on the right side as seen from about near the end.  Anatomy  The animal very similar to that of Girasia, but the lobes of the mantle united into an oval shield, tricarinate above and completely covering the shell, only a small pinhole-like orifice near the posterior end being left open. From this small orifice a distinct line or cicatrix runs to the pneumostome (the respiratory aperture) on the right side, marking the dividing line of the right and left shell-lobes. The mantle extends forward over the neck, but not behind the shield, which is sunk behind in a depression of the back. The body behind the shield is sharply keeled above and terminates in a large mucous pore. Peripodial groove distinct as usual, but narrow, and sole tripartite longitudinally. Genitalia and odontophore much resembling those of Girasia. From Girasia the present genus is separated by its almost imperforate shield, the more solid shell of different form, and by several small distinctions in the genitalia. Reproductive system: The dart-sac is long and cylindrical. There is a large swelling of the free oviduct (ovitheca) just beyond the point where the vas deferens is given off. The spermatheca is rather irregularly ovate, and increases in size when containing numerous spermatophores. The penis is provided with a small kalc-sac and gives off a short caecum. The retractor muscle is attached to the bend. The radula has a broad band of wider median teeth, tricuspid as a rule, and these pass into bicuspid outer laterals, with the two cusps subequal and terminal as in Girasia.

Moḥammad b. Moḥammad b. Aḥmad\\" in Encyclopedia Iranica. accessed 2012. He is best known in the history of Islam for his ideas on love and the meaning of love , expressed primarily in the book Sawāneḥ. Ahmad Ghazali was among the Sunni Muslim mystics who regarded Iblis as the paragon of lovers in self sacrifice for refusing to bow down to Adam out of pure devotion to God Life The younger brother of the better known theologian, jurist, and Sufi, Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad al-Ghazālī, Ahmad Ghazālī was born in a village near Tūs, in Khorasan. Here he was educated primarily in jurisprudence. He turned to Sufism while still young, becoming the pupil first of Abu Bakr Nassaj Tusi (died 1094) and then of Abu Ali Farmadi (died 1084). He was advanced in Sufism by 1095, and his brother Abū Ḥāmid asked him to teach in his place in the Nezamiya of Baghdad and assume responsibility during his planned absence. Ahmad Ghazālī’s thought, centered as it was on the idea of love, left a profound mark on the development of Persian Islamic mystical literature, especially poetry celebrating love. Many of the topoi (maẓāmīn) used by later poets such as ʿAṭṭār, Saʿdī, ʿIrāqī, and Ḥāfeẓ, to name but a few, can be traced to his works, particularly the Sawāneḥ. Among his predecessors, he was influenced most strongly by Ḥallāj, and he made of his idea of essential love the basis of his own thought. His belief that all created beauty is an emanation of divine beauty was likewise Hallajian or neo- Platonic in origin. Since God is both absolute beauty and the lover of all phenomenal beauty, Ahmad Ghazālī maintained, to adore any object of beauty is to participate in a divine act of love. Hence the practice of naẓar-bāzī or šāhed-bāzī, gazing on young and beautiful faces, a practice for which he became notorious. Students of Ahmad al Ghazali Ahmad Ghazālī travelled extensively in the capacities of both Sufi master and a popular preacher. He visited Nishapur, Maragheh, Hamadan and Isfahan. He initiated and trained eminent masters of Sufism including Ayn al-Quzat Hamadani , Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir , Abu al-Najib al-Suhrawardi , The latter was the founder of the Suhrawardiyya Order and its derivatives such as the Kubrawiyya, Mevlevi and Ni'matullāhī orders. He died in Qazvin in 1123 or 1126 and is buried there. Works *Sawāneḥ,Nasrollah Pourjavady (translator) (1986). Ahmad Ghazzālī: Sawānih (with notes). a little book written around 1114 and comprising some 77 short chapters. It was innovative in form, for at a time when Persian Sufi authors used only prose, Ghazālī had recourse to verse in order to illustrate in metaphorical fashion the themes he expounded more technically in the prose sections of his work. *Risālat al-ṭayr (or al-ṭuyūr) (Epistle of the Birds): In this work Ghazālī employs the metaphor of a bird and its journey to speak of the spiritual path to illumination in God. This work set a precedent for the Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur. *Al-tajrīd fī kalimat al- tawḥīd, a theological and mystical interpretation of the basic testimony of Islam, Lā ilāha illā Allāh, which reflects his adherence to the Ashʿarite school of theology. *Baḥr al-maḥabba fī asrār al-mawadda, a Sufi commentary on Sūrat Yūsuf (Koran 12); and an abridgment of his brother’s Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn, a work he himself taught. *Bawāriq al-ilmāʾ fī l-radd ‘alā man yuḥarrim al- samāʾ, a description and justification of the Sufi Sama ritual and apology for the compatibility of music and Islam.

He served as Bishop of Little Rock from 1867 until his death in 1907. Biography Edward Fitzgerald was born in Limerick to James and Joanna (née Pratt) Fitzgerald. He was one of eight children one of whom, Joseph, also became a priest. In 1849 he and his parents immigrated to the United States in the aftermath of the Great Famine of Ireland. He attended St. Mary's of the Barrens Seminary at Perryville, Missouri from 1850 to 1852, and then completed his theological studies at Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West in Cincinnati, Ohio and at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Fitzgerald was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John Baptist Purcell on August 22, 1857. His first and only assignment was pastor of St. Patrick's Church in Columbus, Ohio, where he healed a divisive ethnic schism between the Irish and German immigrants. He gained his American citizenship in 1859. On April 24, 1866, Fitzgerald was appointed the second Bishop of Little Rock, Arkansas, by Pope Pius IX. However, he initially refused the appointment but was commanded by the Holy See to accept in December. He received his episcopal consecration on February 3, 1867 from Archbishop Purcell, with Bishops John Joseph Lynch, C.M., and Sylvester Horton Rosecrans serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Church. At age 33, he was the youngest member of the American hierarchy. Fitzgerald presided over a period of great growth in the Little Rock Diocese. Arriving in Arkansas by steamboat in March 1867, he found four parishes, five priests, and 1,600 Catholics; by the time of his death in 1907, there were 41 churches with resident priests, 32 missions, 60 priests, and 20,000 Catholics. He first rebuilt the churches and missions ravaged by the Civil War. From 1869 to 1870, he attended the First Vatican Council. At the Council, Fitzgerald was one of the only two bishops (the other being Aloisio Riccio) to vote against papal infallibility.Petersen, Svend. \\"The Little Rock against the Bog Rock\\", Arkansas Historical Quarterly 2 (June 1943} p. 164 While he believed in the theological grounds for infallibility, he feared that its dogmatic definition would hamper the conversion of non-Catholics in Arkansas. However, he fully submitted to the Council's decision when the tally ended. Fitzgerald encouraged Catholic immigration to Arkansas from Germany, Italy, and Poland; introduced the Benedictine Sisters and the Sisters of Charity; and established St. Benedict's Priory. He laid the cornerstone of St. Andrew's Cathedral in July 1878, and dedicated it in November 1881. He delivered the opening sermon at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884, and opened St. Vincent's Infirmary (the first hospital in Arkansas) in 1888. In 1894 he dedicated the first Catholic church in Arkansas for African Americans, at Pine Bluff. Fitzgerald suffered a stroke in January 1900, and was subsequently paralyzed. He received John Baptist Morris as his coadjutor bishop in June 1906. He also suffered from depression, once writing, \\"I find in me a growing dislike in making exertions of any kind, a bad sign in me, no longer a young man...I am overwhelmed with despondency and gloom.\\" Fitzgerald later died at St. Joseph's Hospital in Hot Springs, aged 73. He is buried in a crypt under St. Andrew's Cathedral.

This small tributary of the Delaware River remains today, as a sewer, under Willow Street, which winds its way through what is sometimes called the East Callowhill Industrial District. Its name, spelled various ways (Cohoquenoque, Cohoquonoque, Cohoquinoke), is said to be derived from a Lenni-Lenape word for \\"the grove of long pine trees.\\" This was also the name of a nearby Lenape village. Accounts vary, but Cohoquinoque Creek arose around the present-day intersection of Fifteenth and Spring Garden Streets (and perhaps as far north as Fairmount Avenue) and was also fed by a well-known spring in the Spring Garden district near present-day Ninth Street. The creek was later primarily known as Pegg's Run. Willow Street, a rare curvilinear street in the older part of Philadelphia, is wavy because it follows the course of the old stream. For centuries, Cohoquinoque Creek has often been confused with Cohocksink Creek, which is about a mile to the north. Early history At one time, Cohoquinoque Creek was navigable by small boats from the Delaware, and farm products were floated on flat boats for sale in Philadelphia. Rowers could even make their way up as far as the famous Spring Garden spring. In the 1780s, a bridge (Poole's or Pool's bridge) was built over the stream at Front Street and citizens were proud of this early structure. The land on both sides was low and swampy, and several people straying from the causeway lost their lives in the mud. There were sluices under the causeway to permit free flowing of water. The name Pegg’s Run was derived from Daniel Pegg, a Quaker brickmaker who once possessed nearly all of the Northern Liberties south of Cohocksink Creek. Pegg in 1686 acquired three hundred and fifty acres of marshy ground in that area from one Jurian Hartsfelder, who held a patent on the land dating back years before the arrival of William Penn. (The land along the Delaware River that became Philadelphia was under Swedish control from 1638 to 1655, when it passed to Dutch control, and then English control in 1664.) Industrial use and conversion to sewer Detail of Cohoquinoque Creek (Pegg's Run) on an 1802 street map of Philadelphia. Accounts vary as to when Pegg's Run was covered over and made into a city sewer. One states that the stream was covered as far west as Franklin Street (now removed) by 1811 and to Ninth Street by 1824. Whatever the case, the stream had become tremendously polluted even as early as the late 18th century, with numerous tanneries and other early Philadelphia industries located along its banks. The following accounts indicate how bad the situation was: > A small stream of water, called Pegg's Run, passes through a portion of the > Northern Liberties and Spring Garden, which, until a few years ago, was left > open and unimproved. The bottom of the stream was miry, and, at low tide and > in hot and droughty weather, was often destitute of sufficient water to > carry off its contents.

(Most of the language within this quote was taken from an article entitled \\"An Account of the Yellow or Malignant Fever Which Appeared in the City of Philadelphia in the Summer and Autumn of 1820 with Observations on That Disease,\\" by Dr. Samuel Jackson, beginning on page 313 of volume 1 of The Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences (1820), at page 355.) After the sewer was built, the tanners and other industries along the way obtained entrances into it, and thus continued discharging their wastes into the covered stream and out into the nearby Delaware River. Willow Street was built on top of the culvert by 1829. Around 1834, tracks were laid on the thoroughfare by the Northern Liberties and Penn Township Railroad. These tracks ran from the Delaware River to Broad Street and connected to the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad tracks on Pennsylvania Avenue. In the 1850s, the entire line became part of the Reading Railroad. Modern times When the East Callowhill Street district was cleared for urban redevelopment in the late 1960s (i.e., the Callowhill East Urban Renewal Area project), the tracks were removed but the sewer remained. This is why Willow Street itself was not removed when the other streets in the district were. The sewer flows into the Delaware River at what was once known as the Willow Street wharf. Today, that vicinity is midpoint between Callowhill and Spring Garden Streets.

These eggs are common and usually nothing to worry about. The eggs can also be called fart eggs, cock eggs, fairy eggs, dwarf eggs, and witch eggs.Merriam-Webster.com Such eggs are sometimes also called wind eggs, but this term more often refers to eggs without a shell or with a soft shell and less often to eggs that are rotten or unfertilized.Oxford Universal Dictionary Why they are laid A cock egg is most often a pullet's first effort, produced before her laying mechanism is fully ready. In a mature hen, a wind egg is unlikely, but can occur if a bit of reproductive tissue breaks away, stimulating the egg-producing glands to treat it as a yolk and wrap it in albumen, membranes and a shell as it travels through the egg tube. This has occurred if, instead of a yolk, the egg contains a small particle of grayish tissue. This type of egg occurs in many varieties of fowl, including chickens (both standard and bantams), guineafowl, and Japanese (Coturnix) quail. Etymology Since they contain no yolk and therefore cannot hatch, these eggs were traditionally believed to be laid by cocks. This gave rise to the myth that when a cock's egg was hatched, it would produce a cockatrice, a fearsome serpent which could kill with its evil stare. According to the superstition, this could be prevented by throwing the egg over the family dwelling so it smashed at the other side without touching the roof. In other animals Leatherback sea turtles are known to lay large clutches of viable eggs interspersed with yolkless eggs. This may be due to too much albumen, or it may function to separate viable eggs from each other and thereby improve gas exchange. The fossilized egg classified parataxonomically as Parvoblongoolithus may represent an instance of a yolkless egg in an unknown species of dinosaur.
