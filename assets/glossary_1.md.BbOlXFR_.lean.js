During the turbulent disputes over Samogitia, he was sent as a negotiation to the Teutonic Knights. Along with Stanislovas Čiupurna, Manvydas was the most influential noble during the early reign of Grand Duke Vytautas. Biography Manvydas was first mentioned in a document dated 1387–89 when he, along other nobles, vouched for Hryćka Konstantynowicza who organized a rebellion against Skirgaila, regent of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the name of his brother Jogaila. He was a starosta of Vilnius from 1396 to 1413. After an administrative reform that established Vilnius Voivodeship in 1413, Manvydas became the first Voivode of Vilnius and held that position until his death. During the First Samogitian uprising, he was sent on diplomatic missions to the Teutonic Knights and helped negotiate the Peace of Raciąż (1404). In 1403, komtur of Balga gifted him spurs, a symbol of knighthood. Very likely, he commanded a Lithuanian unit in the Battle of Grunwald. He participated in the 1413 Union of Horodło and received Leliwa coat of arms though he had used a personal coat of arms as early as the 1398 treaty of Salynas. Manvydas was among Lithuanian diplomats negotiating with Benedict Makrai, mediator of the Lithuanian–Teutonic dispute over Samogitia. Property Die Littauischen Wegeberichte mentioned Manewidendorf near Hieraniony (now in Belarus). Other patronymic territories included Vishnyeva, , and possibly Braslaw. He also had possessions in Vilnius. He funded the Chapel of St. Albert and St. George (his and his brother's Christian names) within Vilnius Cathedral, which is possibly the present-day Chapel of Ignatius of Loyola, and was buried there. He also funded a Catholic church in Braslaw. His donation to a Franciscan monastery in Ashmyany in 1407 is the first known surviving personal document of a Lithuanian noble; the surviving copy is a forgery, but likely was based on a similar document. Family The document from 1387–89 recorded his patronymic name as Коиликиновичъ which allows to deconstruct his father's name as Gailiginas (Kojlikin, Gojligin). Manvydas was his pagan Lithuanian name. When Lithuania converted to Christianity, he was given Albertas (Albert) as his baptismal name. Since Wojciech is interchangeable with Albert in the Polish language, he is also known as Wojciech (). Manvydas was a brother of Jurgis Gedgaudas, starosta of Podolia, who became Voivode of Vilnius after Manvydas' death. Manvydas was married twice: Jadvyga and Juliania. Jadviga's origin is unknown. Polish historians and Marceli Antoniewicz have attempted to identify her with who adopted Manvydas in the 1413 Union of Horodło. Information on Juliana is conflicting. Origo regis Jagyelo et Witholdi ducum Lithuaniae mentions that Juliana, who later married Manvydas, was wife of Butrimas, the murdered nephew of Birutė and cousin of Vytautas. Jan Długosz mentions that Juliana was a widow of Narimantas, who died in defense of Vilnius in 1390, and a sister of Anna, wife of Vytautas. Lithuanian historian Inga Baranauskienė suggested that Manvydas rose to prominence in the service of Vytautas due to them being in-laws and that Jadviga (mentioned once in a 1407 document) was just a baptismal name of Juliana. Manvydas had one known son Jonas Manvydas who died in 1458.

Furāt al-Kūfī, by Amir- Moezzi, Mohammad Ali It is the most famous book of the author and is a commentary based upon traditions (Hadith). The traditions used by this book are mainly narrated either from Muhammad al-Baqir, Jafar al-SadiqClassical Islam: A Sourcebook of Religious Literature, edited by Norman Calder, Jawid Mojaddedi, Andrew Rippin, p. 160 or Ali's disciples such as \`Abd Allah ibn \`Abbas, Mujahid and Asbagh Ibn Nubata; although there are some that relate to one of the companions of Muhammad. Tafsir Furat Kufi is similar to Tafsir Ayyashi and Tafsir Qomi in that it is selective in offering commentary on Quranic verses. Unlike the two mentioned Tafsirs however, Tafsir Furat Kufi has a Shia Islam outlook and focuses only on verses that include Shia allusions. Tafsir Furat Kufi can be titled an Imami exegesis in all aspects. It has been cited extensively by many Shia scholars of later generations. For example, in his introduction to Bihar al-Anwar, Majlisi counts Tafsir Furat Kufi among the most important sources for his composition. Many old manuscripts of Tafsir Furat Kufi are found in Iran and Iraq.Scripture and Exegesis in Early Imāmī-Shiism By Meʼir Mikhaʼel Bar-Ashe, pp. 29–31 Historical discussion In Shia Islam it is assumed that the Imams inherited their teachings from Prophet Muhammad. The Imams therefore, are considered the first authorities of Qur'anic interpretation. Next come the disciples of the Imams who were mainly transmitters of hadith. The first formative stage of Shia tafsir is therefore referred to the period of the living Imams, including that of the four representatives of the twelfth imam during his lesser occultation. Correspondingly, the second stage is the beginning of written hadith and tafsir tradition. Tafsir Furat Kufi was written in this latter era where commentators recorded the tradition as they received it without much comment of their own. The tone of these writings is largely polemical and defensive. This can be attributed to the fact that at the time Shia theology jurisprudence and hadith tradition was struggling to find a place within the Islamic tradition.The Qurʾan and its interpreters. 1 By Mahmoud Ayoub, p. 38 See also *Qur'an *Qur'anic exegesis (Tafsir) *List of tafsir works References Shia tafsir ","title":"Tafsir Furat Kufi"},{"id":"38633993","text":"Ramona Unified School District is a public school district based in the city of Ramona, in eastern San Diego County, California.

He then he became the company's president and provided oversight of the company's continued expansion plans.

Valle had also developed the concept of a smaller restaurant that would only seat 400 customers as opposed to the long-standing design that seated well over a thousand. Valle's transition to chairman was soon followed by an announcement that he, along with other family members, would sell their controlling shares of the company to a private investment group.

Tinker, a geologist and energy researcher who runs the Bureau of Economic Geology, a 200-person research unit of The University of Texas at Austin.University of Texas, Bureau of Economic Geology and is a professor at the Jackson School of Geosciences.Jackson School of Geosciences The film is part of a larger energy education and efficiency project, which also includes the Switch Energy ProjectOfficial Website website, with additional video contentSwitch Energy Project and educational programs.Switch Energy Project The website includes interviews with some of the world's leading energy policy analysts. Interviews including Ernie Moniz, former Under Secretary of Energy, Steven E. Koonin, Deputy Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, Richard Jones and physicist Richard A. Muller. The film aims to be a nonpartisan, scientifically based exploration of the energy transition from the traditional energies of coal and oil to future energies. It has been accepted by many environmental groups, government agencies, fossil and renewable energy companies and academic institutions. Switch Energy Project Switch premiered at the 2012 Environmental Film FestivalDC Environmental Film Fest in Washington DC to positive reviews,DC Film Review then played at 12 other international festivals, most of them environmentally focused, and at 6 international geology conferences, before opening in theaters in New York in September 2012. Synopsis Switch begins in Norway, where Dr. Tinker explores an electricity system built on renewable hydropower. There, he asks the central question of the film: what will the energy transition look like for the rest of us. Over the next 90 minutes, he travels the world to find out. His first step is to calculate how much energy the average person uses in a year, including all the energy embodied in the food and products we consume, the roads and public buildings we share. He uses that figure to measure and compare each energy type he visits. Tinker starts with the big conventional energies, coal and oil, trying to determine their futures. Can coal be clean? Will we keep using it? Will oil price keep rising? Will we run out of it? He then examines the energies that may replace them. For oil, those are biofuels, natural gas and electricity. For coal, they are geothermal, solar, wind, natural gas and nuclear. With each type, he visits some of the world’s leading facilities, talks to top experts in the Department of Energy, universities and within each industry, and gives a concise and objective analysis of each resource’s major pros and cons. The expertise of the interviewees and the access to restricted energy sites is unparalleled in other energy films. After his journey, he assembles his findings to map out the likely energy future. While coal and oil will continue to play a large role especially in developing countries, a global transition to where their alternatives become dominant will happen in about 50 years. Renewables see by far the largest growth rate, while natural gas makes up the largest portion of the replacement, with nuclear approximately equal in share to renewables. Tinker ends by emphasizing that energy efficiency, including personal energy conservation, will play a vital and growing role in a successful energy future: “The most important thing is to change the way we think about energy, so we can change the way we use it.” Switch Energy Project Efficiency Reviews \\"Switch is refreshingly free of hot air. It’s almost shocking in the way it sidesteps the kind of issue advocacy made commonplace by filmmakers Michael Moore, Davis Guggenheim and the like. Lynch’s film tries (and largely succeeds) in taking a scrupulously neutral tack between extremes.\\" - The Washington PostReview in The Washington Post \\"Sidestepping the usual eco-docu strategy, Switch takes a far less hysterical route. Lynch’s method gives a rational evaluation of where the world is heading. It’s considerably more honest, and manages to be quite effective. Tech credits are tops, particularly the seamless editing and the often beautiful photography.” - VarietyReview in Variety \\"Tinker comes across as affable, reasonable, and unfailingly curious. His interview subjects are technicians, business executives, scientists, government officials. It insures a tone of dispassionate seriousness and good will.\\" - Boston GlobeReview in Boston Globe \\"Tinker takes us along for this beautifully shot ride, excellent in its details, and mixes a kind of gee-whiz wonderment at the way energy is produced with pithy, on-the-mark observations about the realities of those sources. He foresees the increasing use of renewables, natural gas and nuclear power in the US. But he also offers a sobering forecast of why we’re unlikely to shake coal and oil for a long time.\\" - Austin American-StatesmanReview in Austin American Statesman \\"There's no one solution to solving the energy crisis, but that's where Switch provides a valuable resource.

No-hydrofoil version. Project 1231 was a hybrid surface combatant and submarine developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. It was known as \\"Dolphin\\" (Russian: Дельфин) and \\"diving missile boat\\" (Russian: ныряющий катер-ракетоносец), and represented a fundamentally new type of ship. It was a missile boat, with a considerable surface speed, yet able to dive and move underwater. The idea of building project 1231 is said to have originated with the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, who during a visit to a naval base in Balaklava saw submarines and missile boats next to each other. He conceived of an entire fleet able to submerge and thus ensure secrecy in the event of nuclear war. Khrushchev originally ordered the creation of a vessel that could fly, swim and dive. The designers convinced Khrushchev that the construction of a practical aircraft with the surface and sub-surface characteristics he required was impossible. Project 1231 built on the results of work on Project 662, a previous submersible ship: in particular, experience of Project 662 led to the use of hydrofoils for greater surfaced speed. Work on Project 1231 was ceased after Khrushchev was deposed in 1964. No prototype was built and the design was closed. According to E. A. Aframeev, Project 1231 had no chance of practical implementation, despite the herculean efforts of designers.  Previous projects  According to E. A. Aframeev the first practical suggestion for similar diving boats came from Valerian Brzezinski, who in 1939 developed the diving torpedo boat M-400 Flea in a special technical bureau of the NKVD in Factory 196, Leningrad. The boat had a surfaced displacement of 35.3 tons and speed of , which when submerged became 74 tons and respectively. It was armed with two torpedo tubes and one machine gun. Power came from 2 diesels (which worked on a closed loop system when dived). The intended tactical employment was to approach the enemy underwater, fire a volley of torpedoes, surface and make a fast getaway. Boat building began in 1939 and by 1941, the boat was 60% ready. The project was temporarily shelved in 1942 during the siege of Leningrad, but damage from artillery fire caused the project to be written off completely.Eduard Aframeev. \\"Diving Missile-Boats\\", Military Parade, 1998 Development of diving boats resumed at the end of the 1950s in the form of Project 662, which was rejected because of the low surface speed of 32 knots. The use of hydrofoils increased the speed of to 45-50 knots, but reduced the range to an unacceptable value. The underwater speed was only 5-6 knots, making the project unfit for combat.

It was first described by Emil Selenka in 1867 and has since been placed in the subgenus Platyperona, making its full scientific name Holothuria (Platyperona) parvula. It is found in shallow areas of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and is unusual among sea cucumbers in that it can reproduce by breaking in half. Description Holothuria parvula is a roughly cylindrical sea cucumber with tube feet on the underside and conical warty protuberances on the upper surface. It is a golden colour. Distribution Holothuria parvula is found on the seabed in shallow water in the tropical western part of the Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Its range includes Bermuda, the West Indies, the Bahamas, the Lesser Antilles, Colombia and Venezuela. Biology Holothuria parvula lives on a sandy seabed and feeds on detritus, algae and plankton. It crawls across the surface or manoeuvres across rocks with its tube feet. If attacked or stressed, this sea cucumber may eject a mass of sticky threads called cuvierian tubules from its anus. These contain a toxin called holothurin and entangle small fish or crabs which are unable to free themselves and eventually die. Meanwhile, the sea cucumber continues on its way and regenerates the tubules in the course of time. Holothuria parvula is able to reproduce asexually by transverse fission. In Bermuda, it does this during the summer when the water temperature rises to at least . A split occurs in the body wall that gradually deepens and extends across the body which eventually breaks apart. The two parts so formed are about equal in size and each can regenerate the lost organs. The gut is the most important organ for survival and both front and rear portions are able to feed again within two months. The gonads take longer to regenerate. In the Bermudan population studied, no juvenile specimens of Holothuria parvula were found during the course of the study, and the researchers thought it likely that little or no recruitment involving planktonic larvae takes place and that fission is an annual event and the main means of reproduction.

Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 36. Dopo una Rissa Life and career He was born in Trieste to a family of modest means. His father was a tailor. Barison found a patron in the aristocratic Anna De Rin, who placed him in apprenticeship with the painter Karl Emil Haase in Trieste, and then enrolled him in the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. In 1872, Barison began to take lessons from the Nazarene painters Karl von Blaas and Eduard Von Engerth, and also took courses in art history from August Eisenmenger. Giuseppe's son Cesare, Violinist Returning to Trieste in 1876, the next year he participated at the Esposizione di Belle Arti, with a canvas depicting Isabella Orsini and her Page, which gains him a two-year stipend from the city to study in Rome. After Rome, he spent some years in Venice, where he was influenced by Giacomo Favretto, and exhibited with the Società Veneta Promotrice di Belle Arti from 1880 onward. In 1886, his painting of Pescheria a Rialto won the Prince Umberto prize, but because of his non-Italian nationality, the award was rescinded. His wife Giulia, originally from Trieste, and not happily settled in Venice, successfully urged her husband to relocate to Trieste, now with his family of three children (Arnaldo, Caesar and Esther). He experienced a chilly reception there, in part due to his personality, in part due to his Venetian style of painting. Venetian Fishmonger At the national exhibition of 1887, Barison was influenced by two paintings, Neapolitan Michele Cammarano's The Brawl (La Rissa), and Genoese Nicolò Barabino's Quasi oliva speciosa. Barison was to echo these paintings in his works After the Brawl (Dopo una rissa) (painted a few months later) and Quasi oliva speciosa in campis in 1899. The latter has a fluid loose brushwork that is characteristic of his later years (demonstrated also by his self-portrait). In Trieste, he gained commissions for the panels for the Savings Bank of Trieste in 1912 depicting The Builders (which includes a self-portrait in flowing red robe) and The Merchants. Subjects of his paintings in the early century include horses rendered with extreme care and precision in the painting Old Song (Municipality of Trieste). The First World War exiled Barison to the house of Roberto Amadi in Pegli, Liguria where he stayed from 1915 to 1918, and continued painting land- and sea-scapes. After the war, he returned to Trieste, and along with contemporaries Guido Grimani and Ugo Flumiani, continued to paint such themes. He often painted outdoors. In his last years Barison took on new influences, including that of Umberto Veruda. He continued to paint for the first two decades of the twentieth century, but by then his paintings still evoked the past century. He died in Trieste on January 7, 1931.

This request was denied. He was appointed chief defense counsel in 2010. In early 2011, Colwell, in his capacity as chief defense counsel, protested attempts to impose strict new rules on attorneys. Under the new rules attorneys would be required to inform camp authorities what language(s) they planned to use to communicate with their clients, and would have to get permission from the CIA before asking questions about confessions they allegedly made while confined in CIA black sites. In late 2011 newly appointed camp commander David B. Woods ordered new, highly restrictive rules on lawyers' communications with their clients. Woods ordered defense attorneys to surrender for review all documents they wanted to share with their clients. Legal commentators suggested that lawyers who complied with the order were putting their license to practice law at risk, as violating attorney-client privilege was a career threatening ethical violation. Colwell ordered all defense attorneys to halt all communication with their clients, until Woods' order was withdrawn.

It aired on Seven Network at various times. Setting The series takes place in Fairy Tale Land, when a fairy tale is messed up, the cops, Johnny Legend Fantasy and Christine Anderson come to fix it. Characters * Johnny Legend Fantasy - Christine's childish, cowardly and clumsy partner who is easily distracted from work; he prefers to style his hair with a comb that he always carries around in his pocket than solve a crime. Johnny's clumsiness and inability to focus properly mostly gets the pair in trouble which is something that he is not often aware of. Although he acts cowardly, he can be serious at times but only in the most extreme of circumstances (or if he wants to). * Christine (Chris) Anderson - A smart, hard-working and patient lady cop and one of two main characters of the show. Christine is the most level-headed and intelligent of the two and takes her job seriously as a cop. She always wants to get the job done right and hates it when an interference or distraction occurs (mostly caused by Johnny's clumsiness and awkwardness). She is partners with Johnny, although she dislikes his behaviour she does see him as good cop and friend. She also often gets transformed into animals by Wanda and other fairy tale characters. She often wears and dark blue jacket with purple pants and has dark orange hair. Her name was slightly similar to Hans Christian Andersen, a Danish author who wrote fairy tales. * Wanda - A clumsy fairy who struggles with magic, which can be troublesome at times. Wanda is also somewhat careless and distracted like Johnny and takes a while to get her spells right. Wanda's magic words are usually \\"Wanda Winkle\\" and was one of the good fairy godmothers from the Sleeping Beauty story, specifically the one who alerted the bad fairy's curse. Wanda is friends with Cinderella's fairy godmother, Agatha and is enemies with Nancy the bad fairy also from Sleeping Beauty. * Chief Horace White - The grumpy, overbearing and no-nonsense chief of F.T.P.D. Station. He is easily annoyed and Johnny's childish awkwardness and carelessness often puts him on the edge of the chief's temper. * Claude - A scientist frog who says he's really a prince, is intelligent enough, but his ideas and inventions are sometimes useless and ridiculous. * Pinocchio - A fairy tale character who works at F.T.P.D. Like the original Pinocchio, his nose grows longer if he tells a lie.

As a type of agile software development,\\"Human Centred Technology Workshop 2006 \\", 2006, PDF, Human Centred Technology Workshop 2006 it advocates frequent \\"releases\\" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted. Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, not programming features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.UPenn-Lectures-design-patterns \\"Design Patterns and Refactoring\\", University of Pennsylvania, 2003.USFCA-edu-601-lecture Extreme Programming. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to \\"extreme\\" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously, i.e. the practice of pair programming.  History  Kent Beck developed extreme programming during his work on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3) payroll project. Beck became the C3 project leader in March 1996. He began to refine the development methodology used in the project and wrote a book on the methodology (Extreme Programming Explained, published in October 1999).Computerworld-appdev-92 \\"Extreme Programming\\", Computerworld (online), December 2001. Chrysler cancelled the C3 project in February 2000, after seven years, when Daimler-Benz acquired the company. Many extreme-programming practices have been around for some time; the methodology takes \\"best practices\\" to extreme levels. For example, the \\"practice of test-first development, planning and writing tests before each micro-increment\\" was used as early as NASA's Project Mercury, in the early 1960s. To shorten the total development time, some formal test documents (such as for acceptance testing) have been developed in parallel with (or shortly before) the software being ready for testing. A NASA independent test group can write the test procedures, based on formal requirements and logical limits, before programmers write the software and integrate it with the hardware. XP takes this concept to the extreme level, writing automated tests (sometimes inside software modules) which validate the operation of even small sections of software coding, rather than only testing the larger features. = Origins = Two major influences shaped software development in the 1990s: * Internally, object-oriented programming replaced procedural programming as the programming paradigm favored by some developers. * Externally, the rise of the Internet and the dot-com boom emphasized speed-to-market and company growth as competitive business factors. Rapidly changing requirements demanded shorter product life-cycles, and often clashed with traditional methods of software development. The Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3) started in order to determine the best way to use object technologies, using the payroll systems at Chrysler as the object of research, with Smalltalk as the language and GemStone as the data access layer. Chrysler brought in Kent Beck, a prominent Smalltalk practitioner, to do performance tuning on the system, but his role expanded as he noted several problems with the development process. He took this opportunity to propose and implement some changes in development practices - based on his work with his frequent collaborator, Ward Cunningham. Beck describes the early conception of the methods: Beck invited Ron Jeffries to the project to help develop and refine these methods. Jeffries thereafter acted as a coach to instill the practices as habits in the C3 team. Information about the principles and practices behind XP disseminated to the wider world through discussions on the original wiki, Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb. Various contributors discussed and expanded upon the ideas, and some spin-off methodologies resulted (see agile software development). Also, XP concepts have been explained, for several years, using a hypertext system map on the XP website at http://www.extremeprogramming.org circa 1999. Beck edited a series of books on XP, beginning with his own Extreme Programming Explained (1999, ), spreading his ideas to a much larger audience. Authors in the series went through various aspects attending XP and its practices. The series included a book critical of the practices. = Current state = XP generated significant interest among software communities in the late 1990s and early 2000s, seeing adoption in a number of environments radically different from its origins. The high discipline required by the original practices often went by the wayside, causing some of these practices, such as those thought too rigid, to be deprecated or reduced, or even left unfinished, on individual sites. For example, the practice of end-of-day integration tests for a particular project could be changed to an end-of-week schedule, or simply reduced to testing on mutually agreed dates. Such a more relaxed schedule could avoid people feeling rushed to generate artificial stubs just to pass the end-of-day testing. A less-rigid schedule allows, instead, the development of complex features over a period of several days. Meanwhile, other agile-development practices have not stood still, and XP continues to evolve, assimilating more lessons from experiences in the field, to use other practices. In the second edition of Extreme Programming Explained (November 2004), five years after the first edition, Beck added more values and practices and differentiated between primary and corollary practices. The Theory of Sustainable Software Development explains why extreme programming teams can thrive in spite of team disruptions.  Concept = Goals = Extreme Programming Explained describes extreme programming as a software- development discipline that organizes people to produce higher-quality software more productively. XP attempts to reduce the cost of changes in requirements by having multiple short development cycles, rather than a long one. In this doctrine, changes are a natural, inescapable and desirable aspect of software-development projects, and should be planned for, instead of attempting to define a stable set of requirements. Extreme programming also introduces a number of basic values, principles and practices on top of the agile programming framework. = Activities = XP describes four basic activities that are performed within the software development process: coding, testing, listening, and designing. Each of those activities is described below.  Coding  The advocates of XP argue that the only truly important product of the system development process is code – software instructions that a computer can interpret. Without code, there is no working product. Coding can be used to figure out the most suitable solution. Coding can also help to communicate thoughts about programming problems. A programmer dealing with a complex programming problem, or finding it hard to explain the solution to fellow programmers, might code it in a simplified manner and use the code to demonstrate what they mean. Code, say the proponents of this position, is always clear and concise and cannot be interpreted in more than one way. Other programmers can give feedback on this code by also coding their thoughts.  Testing  Testing is central to extreme programming. Extreme programming's approach is that if a little testing can eliminate a few flaws, a lot of testing can eliminate many more flaws. * Unit tests determine whether a given feature works as intended. Programmers write as many automated tests as they can think of that might \\"break\\" the code; if all tests run successfully, then the coding is complete. Every piece of code that is written is tested before moving on to the next feature. * Acceptance tests verify that the requirements as understood by the programmers satisfy the customer's actual requirements. System-wide integration testing was encouraged, initially, as a daily end-of-day activity, for early detection of incompatible interfaces, to reconnect before the separate sections diverged widely from coherent functionality. However, system-wide integration testing has been reduced, to weekly, or less often, depending on the stability of the overall interfaces in the system.  Listening  Programmers must listen to what the customers need the system to do, what \\"business logic\\" is needed. They must understand these needs well enough to give the customer feedback about the technical aspects of how the problem might be solved, or cannot be solved. Communication between the customer and programmer is further addressed in the planning game.  Designing  From the point of view of simplicity, of course one could say that system development doesn't need more than coding, testing and listening. If those activities are performed well, the result should always be a system that works. In practice, this will not work. One can come a long way without designing but at a given time one will get stuck. The system becomes too complex and the dependencies within the system cease to be clear. One can avoid this by creating a design structure that organizes the logic in the system. Good design will avoid many dependencies within a system; this means that changing one part of the system will not affect other parts of the system. = Values = Extreme programming initially recognized four values in 1999: communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. A new value, respect, was added in the second edition of Extreme Programming Explained. Those five values are described below.  Communication  Building software systems requires communicating system requirements to the developers of the system. In formal software development methodologies, this task is accomplished through documentation. Extreme programming techniques can be viewed as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among members of a development team. The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system. To this end, extreme programming favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.  Simplicity  Extreme programming encourages starting with the simplest solution. Extra functionality can then be added later. The difference between this approach and more conventional system development methods is the focus on designing and coding for the needs of today instead of those of tomorrow, next week, or next month. This is sometimes summed up as the \\"You aren't gonna need it\\" (YAGNI) approach.\\"Everyone's a Programmer\\" by Clair Tristram. Technology Review, November 2003. p. 39. Proponents of XP acknowledge the disadvantage that this can sometimes entail more effort tomorrow to change the system; their claim is that this is more than compensated for by the advantage of not investing in possible future requirements that might change before they become relevant. Coding and designing for uncertain future requirements implies the risk of spending resources on something that might not be needed, while perhaps delaying crucial features. Related to the \\"communication\\" value, simplicity in design and coding should improve the quality of communication. A simple design with very simple code could be easily understood by most programmers in the team.  Feedback  Within extreme programming, feedback relates to different dimensions of the system development: * Feedback from the system: by writing unit tests, or running periodic integration tests, the programmers have direct feedback from the state of the system after implementing changes. * Feedback from the customer: The functional tests (aka acceptance tests) are written by the customer and the testers. They will get concrete feedback about the current state of their system. This review is planned once in every two or three weeks so the customer can easily steer the development. * Feedback from the team: When customers come up with new requirements in the planning game the team directly gives an estimation of the time that it will take to implement. Feedback is closely related to communication and simplicity. Flaws in the system are easily communicated by writing a unit test that proves a certain piece of code will break. The direct feedback from the system tells programmers to recode this part. A customer is able to test the system periodically according to the functional requirements, known as user stories. To quote Kent Beck, \\"Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming. Feedback is the treatment.\\"  Courage  Several practices embody courage. One is the commandment to always design and code for today and not for tomorrow. This is an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. Courage enables developers to feel comfortable with refactoring their code when necessary. This means reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. Another example of courage is knowing when to throw code away: courage to remove source code that is obsolete, no matter how much effort was used to create that source code. Also, courage means persistence: a programmer might be stuck on a complex problem for an entire day, then solve the problem quickly the next day, but only if they are persistent.  Respect  The respect value includes respect for others as well as self-respect. Programmers should never commit changes that break compilation, that make existing unit-tests fail, or that otherwise delay the work of their peers. Members respect their own work by always striving for high quality and seeking for the best design for the solution at hand through refactoring. Adopting the four earlier values leads to respect gained from others in the team. Nobody on the team should feel unappreciated or ignored. This ensures a high level of motivation and encourages loyalty toward the team and toward the goal of the project. This value is dependent upon the other values, and is oriented toward teamwork. = Rules = The first version of rules for XP was published in 1999 by Don Wells at the XP website. 29 rules are given in the categories of planning, managing, designing, coding, and testing. Planning, managing and designing are called out explicitly to counter claims that XP doesn't support those activities. Another version of XP rules was proposed by Ken AuerKen Auer in XP/Agile Universe 2003. He felt XP was defined by its rules, not its practices (which are subject to more variation and ambiguity). He defined two categories: \\"Rules of Engagement\\" which dictate the environment in which software development can take place effectively, and \\"Rules of Play\\" which define the minute-by-minute activities and rules within the framework of the Rules of Engagement. Here are some of the rules (incomplete): Coding * The customer is always available * Code the unit test first * Only one pair integrates code at a time * Leave optimization until last * No overtime Testing * All code must have unit tests * All code must pass all unit tests before it can be released. * When a bug is found, tests are created before the bug is addressed (a bug is not an error in logic; it is a test that was not written) * Acceptance tests are run often and the results are published = Principles = The principles that form the basis of XP are based on the values just described and are intended to foster decisions in a system development project. The principles are intended to be more concrete than the values and more easily translated to guidance in a practical situation.  Feedback  Extreme programming sees feedback as most useful if it is done frequently and promptly. It stresses that minimal delay between an action and its feedback is critical to learning and making changes. Unlike traditional system development methods, contact with the customer occurs in more frequent iterations. The customer has clear insight into the system that is being developed, and can give feedback and steer the development as needed. With frequent feedback from the customer, a mistaken design decision made by the developer will be noticed and corrected quickly, before the developer spends much time implementing it. Unit tests contribute to the rapid feedback principle. When writing code, running the unit test provides direct feedback as to how the system reacts to the changes made. This includes running not only the unit tests that test the developer's code, but running in addition all unit tests against all the software, using an automated process that can be initiated by a single command. That way, if the developer's changes cause a failure in some other portion of the system that the developer knows little or nothing about, the automated all-unit-test suite will reveal the failure immediately, alerting the developer of the incompatibility of their change with other parts of the system, and the necessity of removing or modifying their change. Under traditional development practices, the absence of an automated, comprehensive unit-test suite meant that such a code change, assumed harmless by the developer, would have been left in place, appearing only during integration testing – or worse, only in production; and determining which code change caused the problem, among all the changes made by all the developers during the weeks or even months previous to integration testing, was a formidable task.  Assuming simplicity  This is about treating every problem as if its solution were \\"extremely simple\\". Traditional system development methods say to plan for the future and to code for reusability. Extreme programming rejects these ideas. The advocates of extreme programming say that making big changes all at once does not work. Extreme programming applies incremental changes: for example, a system might have small releases every three weeks. When many little steps are made, the customer has more control over the development process and the system that is being developed.  Embracing change  The principle of embracing change is about not working against changes but embracing them. For instance, if at one of the iterative meetings it appears that the customer's requirements have changed dramatically, programmers are to embrace this and plan the new requirements for the next iteration.  Practices  Extreme programming has been described as having 12 practices, grouped into four areas: = Fine-scale feedback = * Pair programming * Planning game * Test-driven development * Whole team = Continuous process = * Continuous integration * Refactoring or design improvement * Small releases = Shared understanding = * Coding standards * Collective code ownership * Simple design * System metaphor = Programmer welfare = * Sustainable pace  Controversial aspects  The practices in XP have been heavily debated. Proponents of extreme programming claim that by having the on-site customer request changes informally, the process becomes flexible, and saves the cost of formal overhead. Critics of XP claim this can lead to costly rework and project scope creep beyond what was previously agreed or funded. Change-control boards are a sign that there are potential conflicts in project objectives and constraints between multiple users. XP's expedited methods are somewhat dependent on programmers being able to assume a unified client viewpoint so the programmer can concentrate on coding, rather than documentation of compromise objectives and constraints. This also applies when multiple programming organizations are involved, particularly organizations which compete for shares of projects. Other potentially controversial aspects of extreme programming include: * Requirements are expressed as automated acceptance tests rather than specification documents. * Requirements are defined incrementally, rather than trying to get them all in advance. * Software developers are usually required to work in pairs. * There is no Big Design Up Front. Most of the design activity takes place on the fly and incrementally, starting with \\"the simplest thing that could possibly work\\" and adding complexity only when it's required by failing tests. Critics compare this to \\"debugging a system into appearance\\" and fear this will result in more re-design effort than only re-designing when requirements change. * A customer representative is attached to the project. This role can become a single-point-of-failure for the project, and some people have found it to be a source of stress. Also, there is the danger of micro-management by a non-technical representative trying to dictate the use of technical software features and architecture. Critics have noted several potential drawbacks, including problems with unstable requirements, no documented compromises of user conflicts, and a lack of an overall design specification or document. = Scalability = ThoughtWorks has claimed reasonable success on distributed XP projects with up to sixty people. In 2004, industrial extreme programming (IXP) was introduced as an evolution of XP. It is intended to bring the ability to work in large and distributed teams. It now has 23 practices and flexible values. = Severability and responses = In 2003, Matt Stephens and Doug Rosenberg published Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP, which questioned the value of the XP process and suggested ways in which it could be improved. This triggered a lengthy debate in articles, Internet newsgroups, and web-site chat areas. The core argument of the book is that XP's practices are interdependent but that few practical organizations are willing/able to adopt all the practices; therefore the entire process fails. The book also makes other criticisms, and it draws a likeness of XP's \\"collective ownership\\" model to socialism in a negative manner. Certain aspects of XP have changed since the publication of Extreme Programming Refactored; in particular, XP now accommodates modifications to the practices as long as the required objectives are still met. XP also uses increasingly generic terms for processes. Some argue that these changes invalidate previous criticisms; others claim that this is simply watering the process down. Other authors have tried to reconcile XP with the older methodologies in order to form a unified methodology. Some of these XP sought to replace, such as the waterfall methodology; example: Project Lifecycles: Waterfall, Rapid Application Development (RAD), and All That. JPMorgan Chase & Co. tried combining XP with the computer programming methods of capability maturity model integration (CMMI), and Six Sigma. They found that the three systems reinforced each other well, leading to better development, and did not mutually contradict.Extreme Programming (XP) Six Sigma CMMI.  Criticism  Extreme programming's initial buzz and controversial tenets, such as pair programming and continuous design, have attracted particular criticisms, such as the ones coming from McBreen and Boehm and Turner, Matt Stephens and Doug Rosenberg. Many of the criticisms, however, are believed by Agile practitioners to be misunderstandings of agile development.sdmagazine In particular, extreme programming has been reviewed and critiqued by Matt Stephens's and Doug Rosenberg's Extreme Programming Refactored. Criticisms include: * a methodology is only as effective as the people involved, Agile does not solve this * often used as a means to bleed money from customers through lack of defining a deliverable product * lack of structure and necessary documentation * only works with senior-level developers * incorporates insufficient software design * requires meetings at frequent intervals at enormous expense to customers * requires too much cultural change to adopt * can lead to more difficult contractual negotiations * can be very inefficient; if the requirements for one area of code change through various iterations, the same programming may need to be done several times over. Whereas if a plan were there to be followed, a single area of code is expected to be written once. * impossible to develop realistic estimates of work effort needed to provide a quote, because at the beginning of the project no one knows the entire scope/requirements * can increase the risk of scope creep due to the lack of detailed requirements documentation * Agile is feature-driven; non-functional quality attributes are hard to represent as user stories.

Moltopera targets mainly the young and those who dislike opera, inviting new audiences for the genre. In order to achieve this, Moltopera tries to dismiss the general opera stereotypes of the \\"fat, incomprehensible singers and unrealistic stories on stage.\\" Apart from the stage performances, Moltopera also gives lectures in universities and secondary schools. History=Foundation= Moltopera was founded by László Ágoston in August 2011. Their debut concert was on 15 February 2011. At this time, Moltopera had a constant company, gathering the most talented singers of the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. In this introductory venue, the following artists stepped on stage: Renáta Göncz, Zoltán Gradsach, Dávid Dani, Katalin Vámosi, András Decsi, László Ágoston, András Kiss, Marianna Sipos and the pianist Janka Kulcsár, all of which are considered the founding members. Moltopera's first concert was so successful that Moltopera was asked to perform again. One month later, Moltopera was invited to perform in front of 400 international managers in the annual conference of the International Artist Managers' Association (IAMA) in one of the most renowned Hungarian concert halls, the Palace of Arts. =Productions= Although the independent opera company received no monetary support, Moltopera's audience grew. After performing the sextet from Mozart's Don Giovanni in the IAMA congress, they received numerous invitations to perform in Hungary. In May, Moltopera's conductor, Csaba Tőri, gave a lecture for the inquiry of Da Vinci Learning TV channel in the Millenaris Park. This event was followed by 25 other occasions held by him and other Moltopera members (Lili Békéssy, László Ágoston). Moltopera was invited to perform on two nights at the Sziget Festival, one of the largest musical and cultural festivals in Europe. Moltopera put on stage Mozart's Magic Flute and a narrated, educational aria recital following they \\"opera in every venues\\" principle in a pop-rock festival. The main attraction of Moltopera in the autumn season of 2012 was the Magic Flute, leading to a highly promoted, full house production in the Palace of Arts. =Magic Flute! I love it!= Most of Moltopera's stage directions are simple but traditional -Magic Flute! I love it! is their most controversial (contemporary set) performance. In an interview with the new stage director Olga Sára Kelenhegyi and dramaturg Eszter Diána Mátrai, they had boosted the expectations of the show when they announced the performance with László Ágoston: \\"this performance will hurt a lot of people\\". After numerous successful traditional performances, Moltopera has chosen to put Magic Flute in a psychiatry, using own, self-written prosaic parts and a six-member ensemble instead of a symphonic orchestra transcribed by the young composer Kayamar. The critics disputed long about the direction, but the singers had three curtain calls and Moltopera became recognized nationwide, receiving publicity even from Serbia. Moltopera featured numerous guest artists in this production, even involving singers from the Hungarian State Opera, which predicted the transformation of the opera company. =Moltopera in the 2013 season= Since January 2013, Moltopera Company works without a constant staff of singers, but with a constant technical crew (conductor, répétiteur, stage director, management). On 31 January 2013, in Moltopera's La Bohéme in the National Theater of Pécs, only Marianna Sipos, Janka Kulcsár, Zoltán Gradsach and László Ágoston were featured from the founding members beside acclaimed singers like Ildikó Szakács or András Hajdú. Even with the change of the structure, Moltopera's priority remains the same: teach the everyday people how to like opera without taking solfege classes and google the plot of the upcoming opera. =Going international= In January 2014 Moltopera Germany has been launched with the presidency of Nils Matthiesen. The first sign of life from the German organization came in May, when Moltopera debuted in Germany with a short concert in the Parliament of Dresden in the presence of such excellencies as Matthias Theodor Vogt or \\"the second man of Germany\\" Norbert Lammert. Soon after this Moltopera Germany accomplished an educational project in the Görlitz area, with the participation of both Hungarian and German members supported by the European Union. =Debut in the Hungarian State Opera= From 23 November 2014 Moltopera is engaged to perform a series of Haydn's \\"L' isola disabitata\\" in the Hungarian State Opera in cooperation with the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest accompanied by the musicians of the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra. =Twelve performances in the Hungarian State Opera in 2015/2016= After last year’s very successful debut with Haydn’s The desert island (L’isola disabitata), Moltopera will perform in Hungarian State Opera in the next season, too. The new premiere, The Hopping from the Seraglio, a children’s opera is directed by János Novák. Moltopera debuted in the Hungarian State Opera on 23 November 2014 with the Zsófi Geréb-directed The desert island and was very successful not only according to critics, but also according to the Opera House’s management. Hungarian State Opera has not only asked Moltopera to keep on performing The desert island during the next season, but also to present a new opera. The new piece is a children’s version of the well-known opera of W. A. Mozart, The Abduction from the Seraglio. Although ’The Desert Island’ aims also on teenagers, the new premiere is for children between 6 and 10 years. It is directed by the Jászai Mari Award-laureate János Novák, head of Kolibri Theatre, and conducted by the Lantos Rezső-prize awarded Csaba Tőri. The cast, as always, will be composed from young singers between the age of 20 and 35 who will have to face some extraordinary challenges. Education Csaba Töri, the conductor of Moltopera Company gives a lecture to a young audience. Moltopera Company also puts great emphasis on giving lectures in schools, universities and other places. These lectures are given by conductor Csaba Tőri, László Ágoston general manager, singer and stage director or invited young musicologists \\"telling in the language of young why does a young choose the classical musicians' life\\". Beside the greatest Hungarian universities (Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Semmelweis University, Corvinus University of Budapest etc.) Moltopera also participated in the nationally known Hungarian Day of Songs and worked for the Da Vinci Learning TV channel. Mission=Interest in opera= Moltopera has stated on their website that their goal is to \\"face the widely known stereotypes of the opera and to demonstrate that opera can be a real alternative against movie theaters and discos even in the 21st century!\\" Moltopera defines some of these stereotypes as: *Opera singers are seen as typically \\"fat\\" and \\"ugly.\\" *Opera is unrealistic (\\"Opera is when a guy gets stabbed in the back and, instead of bleeding, he sings.\\") *Opera singers \\"park and bark\\" on stage (A phenomenon in opera where the singer makes no attempt to play a part, that is to act, and instead simply stands and sings.) *Opera is a form of entertainment suitable only for \\"snobs\\". *Opera requires a substantial amount of preparation and work (How to attend your first opera on Wikihow). *Opera is incomprehensible and unnatural to those who are not familiar with the genre of entertainment. Moltopera asserts that \\"In order to reach those people who are not likely to attend any opera performance, the company has to descend from the ivory tower of art and grab the initiative.\\" Performances Taken in a countryside Magic Flute performance of the Moltopera Company. A performance optimized to mobility. (The Queen of the Night – Marianna Sipos; Pamina – Renáta Göncz) Moltopera performs in a multitude of venues, such as rock festivals, pubs, and countryside theaters where opera has never been shown. They work with minimal sets and props (usually with piano accompaniment) creating \\"lightweight\\", easily portable productions. Stage directing Moltopera has stated its belief in giving vivid and rational directions. In an article by Tom Huizenga for Deceptive Cadence, it is pointed out that an opera has to compete with all the other 21st century possibilities of entertainment like 3D films or PlayStation, as their primary target group has easy and wide access to these other free time activities. Moltopera believes the best example of this way of thinking is their Don Giovanni Sextet rendition, which is usually sung standing in a half circle around Leporello, but László Ágoston directing a full, moving episode from it. Youth involvement Moltopera has played cut versions of operas for different university classes or colleges. They enhance understanding with narration in everyday language avoiding lexical information. The ratio of these two elements – and the length of the performance – varies according to the venue and the type of the audience. Moltopera believes that, just like in peer education, in opera, young people tend to listen closer when other young people are talking or singing. Moltopera asserts that it is even more important in an area where performers usually reach the better roles later in their career, in the age range of thirty to forty. Moltopera's average age of performance was 25 years in their beginnings. After the change of structure, this data became irrelevant, but Moltopera still holds this as a principle to employ as young singers as soon as possible, without the loss of overall quality of work.

There, he designed especially public building, which are characterized by a very complex modernity. In many buildings, artists were involved, for art and for the color scheme. The dormitories in Frankfurt, however, were very purist and followed the forms which were introduced by Ferdinand Kramer at the Frankfurt University. From 1958 he was a professor at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Kassel (today part of University of Kassel). In the same year he set up his own architectural offices in Offenbach am Main and Kassel. The transformation of the 18th- century architecture Schloss Wilhelmshöhe with a deliberately avant-garde interior design into a modern museum was citisized heavily by traditionalists. Paul Friedrich Posenenske was married with the painter and sculptor Charlotte Posenenske. In 1987 he moved with his wife to Pottum Westerwald, where he worked and lived until his death.

This drama is directed and produced by Lucien Bulathsinhala. Tharawo Igilithi, by playwright Lucian Bulathsinhala’s stage play of the 1980s and 1990s has made a comeback after ten years as a new production. Music is produced by Gunadasa Kapuge. First staged in July 24, 1981 at Lumbini Theatre, Colombo, the play was popular among the Sri Lankan theatre lovers and shows were staged around the country. The first cast included Vijaya Nandasiri, Neil Alles, Jayalath Manoratne, Jayasiri Chandrajith, Rodney Warnakula, Anula Bulathsinghala, Padmini Divithurugama and Lucian himself. Harsha Bulathsinhala, Jackson Anthony, Rodney Warnakula, Mercy Edirisinghe, Anula Bulathsinhala are the current actors in this drama.  Production  Lucien Bulathsinhala is Producer and Writer of Tharawo Igilethi Stage Drama. The overbooked play however failed mainly due to the cast which left it. Soon “Tharawo Igilethi’ made the second coming with some new faces and was first staged at Nuwara Eliya on April 25, 1982. Once again the popular play went around the country with its evergreen 11 songs like ‘Made Lagina Tharawan’ and ‘Sobawade’ under the musical direction of late singer and musician Visharada Gunadasa Kapuge. The cast that joined for the second production was U. Ariyawimal, Saman Bokalawala, Mercy Edirisinghe, Jackson Anthony together with Rodney Warnakula, Anula Bulathsinghala and Nandasena Hewage who were in the first production. With continuous performance for more than fifteen years and with many shows the play finally came to a halt in 1999. “Tharawo Igilethi would never make a comeback for the benefit of the present generation if not for the new producers Bandula Ekanayake, Channa Fernando, H. D. Premasiri and Bandara Eheliyagoda,” Lucian told with gratitude to the new producers. The latest production is played by Harsha Bulathsinhala, Sumith Rathnayake, Niroshan Wijesinghe, Indika Jayasinghe, Piyumi Shanika Botheju, Randima Thilini Perera, Anura Bandara Rajaguru, Ferni Roshini, Mahesh Uyanwatte, Gamini Samarakoon and Rodney Warnakula who was there from the first show of Tharawo Igilethi.

Until his fall from favour and execution in 1578, he dominated the affairs of the Greek Orthodox community (millet) of the Ottoman Empire, being responsible for the rise and fall of bishops and patriarchs.  Background  Nothing is known of Michael Kantakouzenos' origins and early life. Although he bears the name of one of the most distinguished dynasties of the late Byzantine Empire, it was usual among wealthy Greeks of the time to assume Byzantine surnames and claim descent from the famous noble houses of their Byzantine past. On Kantakouzenos himself, the German chaplain Stephan Gerlach, who lived in Constantinople at the time, reported his view that he was actually the son of the English ambassador, but this is mostly dismissed by modern scholars. The eminent Byzantinist Steven Runciman at any rate considered the latter-day Kantakouzenoi \\"perhaps the only family whose claim to be in the direct line from Byzantine Emperors was authentic\\". On the other hand, according to Donald Nicol, \\"Patriotic Rumanian historians have indeed labored to show that ... of all the Byzantine imperial families that of the Kantakouzenos is the only one which can truthfully be said to have survived to this day; but the line of succession after the middle of the fifteenth century is, to say the least, uncertain.\\"  Life  Kantakouzenos made his wealth through successful mercantile speculations, which allowed him to engage in the lucrative tax farming of the Ottoman Empire's provinces. In this he so distinguished himself for his rapacity and severity towards his fellow Christians that he earned the epithet \\"Son of the Devil\\" (Turkish Şeytanoğlu, often rendered Shaytanoglu). He also secured the profitable monopoly on the salt works of Anchialos and the customs of Constantinople, as well as fisheries and the monopoly of the fur trade with Muscovy, which alone was said to bring him an annual revenue of 60,000 ducats. His wealth was such that after the destruction of the Ottoman fleet in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, he was able to build and equip 60 galleys from his own resources. His power was backed and secured by his close relationship with the powerful Grand Vizier, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, and other important figures at the Ottoman court, who received a share of his profits. Michael became thus the most distinguished and powerful of all Greek magnates (archons) of the Ottoman capital. His influence was such that contemporaries called him \\"the pillar\\" of the Greek nation, and the contemporary German scholar Martin Crusius called him \\"the God\\" of the Greeks. As a token of his power, he sealed his letters with the double-headed eagle of the Byzantine emperors. Consequently, Michael played an active role on the sale of offices within the Greek Orthodox community (millet), ranging from provincial episcopal sees to the Patriarchate of Constantinople and even the two Danubian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. Thus in 1565 he brought down the popular Patriarch Joasaph II and installed in his place Metrophanes III, whom he had already previously helped to acquire the bishoprics of Larissa and Chios. In exchange, Metrophanes undertook to pay Kantakouzenos the sum of 2,000 florins a year for eight years; much of this of course went on to fill the pockets of Sokollu Mehmed. Although at first a willing aide in Michael's various schemes, Metrophanes eventually fell out with Kantakouzenos and was deposed in 1572, amidst allegations of treacherous contacts with Western powers. Michael also brought about the downfall of the prince of Wallachia, Peter, and appears to have gained control of the revenues of both Wallachia and Moldavia, which he taxed heavily. Michael preferred to live at Anchialos, a city almost exclusively inhabited by Greeks, where he had built a magnificent palace that cost 20,000 ducats and was said to rival the Sultan's own. Nevertheless, his extravagance aroused the envy and enmity not only of his fellow Greeks, but of the Turks as well, and when the influence of his patron, Sokollu Mehmed, began to decline, his enemies struck: in July 1576 he was arrested and his property confiscated, but he managed to save his life and secure his release through the intervention of Sokollu Mehmed. Kantakouzenos was able to re-acquire his fortune, but he was again accused of plotting against the Sultan, and on 3 March 1578, he was hanged from the gateway of his palace in Anchialos. His possessions, including \\"an almost infinite number\\" of silk, brocaded, or velvet clothes, decorated with gold and rubies and other precious stones, as well as horses and other precious items, were auctioned off. Such was the scale of the affair that having bought something \\"at Şeytanoğlu's auction\\" became proverbial for future generations. Among the items sold was Kantakouzenos' sizeable library, comprising many valuable manuscripts. It was mostly bought up by the monasteries of Mount Athos, which teamed up for the purpose.  Family  Michael married twice. His first wife is unknown, but he had at least one daughter by her, who married a member of the Rallis family. His second wife, whom he wed at an advanced age, was a daughter of the Prince of Wallachia Mircea, but she refused to follow him to Constantinople. Here there is a confusion with his brother Iani who was about to marry that princess. Michael married another prince of Wallachia's daughter, Mircea IInd the grandson of Vlad Dracula (Vlad the Impaler). Michael's three sons, Andronikos (born 1553), Demetrios (born 1566) and John (born 1570), survived him. Andronikos managed to regain part of his father's wealth, and like him rose to the position of king-maker for the Wallachian princes: it was he who nominated Michael the Brave as prince of Wallachia in 1593, and two of his sisters were married to Michael's predecessor prince Stephen the Deaf (or alternatively to Michael's half-brother Peter and Aaron the Tyrant of Moldavia).

The complexification, which always exists, is unique up to unique isomorphism. Its Lie algebra is a quotient of the complexification of the Lie algebra of the original group. They are isomorphic if the original group has a quotient by a discrete normal subgroup which is linear. For compact Lie groups, the complexification, sometimes called the Chevalley complexification after Claude Chevalley, can be defined as the group of complex characters of the Hopf algebra of representative functions, i.e. the matrix coefficients of finite- dimensional representations of the group. In any finite-dimensional faithful unitary representation of the compact group it can be realized concretely as a closed subgroup of the complex general linear group. It consists of operators with polar decomposition , where is a unitary operator in the compact group and is a skew-adjoint operator in its Lie algebra.

The complexification of consists of all operators in such that commutes with and acts trivially on the second summand in . By definition it is a closed subgroup of . The defining relations (as a commutant) show that is an algebraic subgroup. Its intersection with coincides with , since it is a priori a larger compact group for which the irreducible representations stay irreducible and inequivalent when restricted to . Since is generated by unitaries, an invertible operator lies in if the unitary operator and positive operator in its polar decomposition both lie in . Thus lies in and the operator can be written uniquely as with a self-adjoint operator. By the functional calculus for polynomial functions it follows that lies in the commutant of if with in . In particular taking purely imaginary, must have the form with in the Lie algebra of . Since every finite-dimensional representation of occurs as a direct summand of , it is left invariant by and thus every finite-dimensional representation of extends uniquely to . The extension is compatible with the polar decomposition. Finally the polar decomposition implies that is a maximal compact subgroup of , since a strictly larger compact subgroup would contain all integer powers of a positive operator , a closed infinite discrete subgroup.See:  Decompositions in the Chevalley complexification=Cartan decomposition= The decomposition derived from the polar decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{G_{\\\\mathbf{C}} = G\\\\cdot P =G \\\\cdot \\\\exp i\\\\mathfrak{g},} where is the Lie algebra of , is called the Cartan decomposition of . The exponential factor is invariant under conjugation by but is not a subgroup. The complexification is invariant under taking adjoints, since consists of unitary operators and of positive operators. =Gauss decomposition= The Gauss decomposition is a generalization of the LU decomposition for the general linear group and a specialization of the Bruhat decomposition. For it states that with respect to a given orthonormal basis an element of can be factorized in the form :\\\\displaystyle{g=XDY} with lower unitriangular, upper unitriangular and diagonal if and only if all the principal minors of are non-vanishing. In this case and are uniquely determined. In fact Gaussian elimination shows there is a unique such that is upper triangular. The upper and lower unitriangular matrices, and , are closed unipotent subgroups of GL(V). Their Lie algebras consist of upper and lower strictly triangular matrices. The exponential mapping is a polynomial mapping from the Lie algebra to the corresponding subgroup by nilpotence. The inverse is given by the logarithm mapping which by unipotence is also a polynomial mapping. In particular there is a correspondence between closed connected subgroups of and subalgebras of their Lie algebras. The exponential map is onto in each case, since the polynomial function lies in a given Lie subalgebra if and do and are sufficiently small. The Gauss decomposition can be extended to complexifications of other closed connected subgroups of by using the root decomposition to write the complexified Lie algebra asSee:  :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} = \\\\mathfrak{n}_- \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{t}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{n}_+,} where is the Lie algebra of a maximal torus of and are the direct sum of the corresponding positive and negative root spaces. In the weight space decomposition of as eigenspaces of acts as diagonally, acts as lowering operators and as raising operators. are nilpotent Lie algebras acting as nilpotent operators; they are each other's adjoints on . In particular acts by conjugation of , so that is a semidirect product of a nilpotent Lie algebra by an abelian Lie algebra. By Engel's theorem, if is a semidirect product, with abelian and nilpotent, acting on a finite-dimensional vector space with operators in diagonalizable and operators in nilpotent, there is a vector that is an eigenvector for and is annihilated by . In fact it is enough to show there is a vector annihilated by , which follows by induction on , since the derived algebra annihilates a non-zero subspace of vectors on which and act with the same hypotheses. Applying this argument repeatedly to shows that there is an orthonormal basis of consisting of eigenvectors of with acting as upper triangular matrices with zeros on the diagonal. If and are the complex Lie groups corresponding to and , then the Gauss decomposition states that the subset :\\\\displaystyle{N_- T_{\\\\mathbf{C}} N_+} is a direct product and consists of the elements in for which the principal minors are non-vanishing. It is open and dense. Moreover, if denotes the maximal torus in , :\\\\displaystyle{N_\\\\pm=\\\\mathbf{N}_\\\\pm\\\\cap G_{\\\\mathbf{C}},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, T_{\\\\mathbf{C}} = \\\\mathbf{T}_{\\\\mathbf{C}}\\\\cap G_{\\\\mathbf{C}}.} These results are an immediate consequence of the corresponding results for . =Bruhat decomposition= If denotes the Weyl group of and denotes the Borel subgroup , the Gauss decomposition is also a consequence of the more precise Bruhat decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{G_{\\\\mathbf{C}} =\\\\bigcup_{\\\\sigma\\\\in W} B\\\\sigma B,} decomposing into a disjoint union of double cosets of . The complex dimension of a double coset is determined by the length of as an element of . The dimension is maximized at the Coxeter element and gives the unique open dense double coset. Its inverse conjugates into the Borel subgroup of lower triangular matrices in .See: *, section 18, for * for and * for complexifications of simple compact Lie groups * for Harish-Chandra's method * for a treatment using algebraic groups *, Chapter 8  The Bruhat decomposition is easy to prove for . Let be the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices and the subgroup of diagonal matrices. So . For in , take in so that maximizes the number of zeros appearing at the beginning of its rows. Because a multiple of one row can be added to another, each row has a different number of zeros in it. Multiplying by a matrix in , it follows that lies in . For uniqueness, if , then the entries of vanish below the diagonal. So the product lies in , proving uniqueness. showed that the expression of an element as becomes unique if is restricted to lie in the upper unitriangular subgroup . In fact, if , this follows from the identity :\\\\displaystyle{N_+=N_\\\\sigma\\\\cdot M_\\\\sigma.} The group has a natural filtration by normal subgroups with zeros in the first superdiagonals and the successive quotients are Abelian. Defining and to be the intersections with , it follows by decreasing induction on that . Indeed, and are specified in by the vanishing of complementary entries on the th superdiagonal according to whether preserves the order or not. The Bruhat decomposition for the other classical simple groups can be deduced from the above decomposition using the fact that they are fixed point subgroups of folding automorphisms of .See:  For , let be the matrix with 's on the antidiagonal and 's elsewhere and set :\\\\displaystyle{A=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & J\\\\\\\\\\\\ -J & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}.} Then is the fixed point subgroup of the involution . It leaves the subgroups and invariant. If the basis elements are indexed by , then the Weyl group of consists of satisfying , i.e. commuting with . Analogues of and are defined by intersection with , i.e. as fixed points of . The uniqueness of the decomposition implies the Bruhat decomposition for . The same argument works for . It can be realised as the fixed points of in where . =Iwasawa decomposition= The Iwasawa decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{G_{\\\\mathbf{C}} = G\\\\cdot A \\\\cdot N} gives a decomposition for for which, unlike the Cartan decomposition, the direct factor is a closed subgroup, but it is no longer invariant under conjugation by . It is the semidirect product of the nilpotent subgroup by the Abelian subgroup . For and its complexification , this decomposition can be derived as a restatement of the Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization process. In fact let be an orthonormal basis of and let be an element in . Applying the Gram–Schmidt process to , there is a unique orthonormal basis and positive constants such that :\\\\displaystyle{f_i= a_i ge_i + \\\\sum_{j If is the unitary taking to , it follows that lies in the subgroup , where is the subgroup of positive diagonal matrices with respect to and is the subgroup of upper unitriangular matrices. Using the notation for the Gauss decomposition, the subgroups in the Iwasawa decomposition for are defined by See:   :\\\\displaystyle{A=\\\\exp i\\\\mathfrak{t} = \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cap G_{\\\\mathbf{C}}, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, N=\\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{n}_+=\\\\mathbf{N} \\\\cap G_{\\\\mathbf{C}}.} Since the decomposition is direct for , it is enough to check that . From the properties of the Iwasawa decomposition for , the map is a diffeomorphism onto its image in , which is closed. On the other hand, the dimension of the image is the same as the dimension of , so it is also open. So because is connected. gives a method for explicitly computing the elements in the decomposition. For in set . This is a positive self-adjoint operator so its principal minors do not vanish. By the Gauss decomposition, it can therefore be written uniquely in the form with in , in and in . Since is self-adjoint, uniqueness forces . Since it is also positive must lie in and have the form for some unique in . Let be its unique square root in . Set and . Then is unitary, so is in , and . Complex structures on homogeneous spaces The Iwasawa decomposition can be used to describe complex structures on the s in complex projective space of highest weight vectors of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of . In particular the identification between and can be used to formulate the Borel–Weil theorem. It states that each irreducible representation of can be obtained by holomorphic induction from a character of , or equivalently that it is realized in the space of sections of a holomorphic line bundle on . The closed connected subgroups of containing are described by Borel–de Siebenthal theory. They are exactly the centralizers of tori . Since every torus is generated topologically by a single element , these are the same as centralizers of elements in . By a result of Hopf is always connected: indeed any element is along with contained in some maximal torus, necessarily contained in . Given an irreducible finite-dimensional representation with highest weight vector of weight , the stabilizer of in is a closed subgroup . Since is an eigenvector of , contains . The complexification also acts on and the stabilizer is a closed complex subgroup containing . Since is annihilated by every raising operator corresponding to a positive root , contains the Borel subgroup . The vector is also a highest weight vector for the copy of corresponding to , so it is annihilated by the lowering operator generating if . The Lie algebra of is the direct sum of and root space vectors annihilating , so that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{p}=\\\\mathfrak{b}\\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{(\\\\alpha,\\\\lambda)=0} \\\\mathfrak{g}_{-\\\\alpha}.} The Lie algebra of is given by . By the Iwasawa decomposition . Since fixes , the -orbit of in the complex projective space of coincides with the orbit and :\\\\displaystyle{G/H=G_{\\\\mathbf{C}}/P.} In particular :\\\\displaystyle{G/T=G_{\\\\mathbf{C}}/B.} Using the identification of the Lie algebra of with its dual, equals the centralizer of in , and hence is connected. The group is also connected. In fact the space is simply connected, since it can be written as the quotient of the (compact) universal covering group of the compact semisimple group by a connected subgroup, where is the center of . If is the identity component of , has as a covering space, so that . The homogeneous space has a complex structure, because is a complex subgroup. The orbit in complex projective space is closed in the Zariski topology by Chow's theorem, so is a smooth projective variety. The Borel–Weil theorem and its generalizations are discussed in this context in , , and . The parabolic subgroup can also be written as a union of double cosets of :\\\\displaystyle{P=\\\\bigcup_{\\\\sigma\\\\in W_\\\\lambda} B\\\\sigma B,} where is the stabilizer of in the Weyl group . It is generated by the reflections corresponding to the simple roots orthogonal to .See:  Noncompact real forms There are other closed subgroups of the complexification of a compact connected Lie group G which have the same complexified Lie algebra. These are the other real forms of GC. =Involutions of simply connected compact Lie groups= If G is a simply connected compact Lie group and σ is an automorphism of period 2, then the fixed point subgroup K = Gσ is automatically connected. (In fact this is true for any automorphism of G, as shown for inner automorphisms by Steinberg and in general by Borel.) See:  , Exercise 11 This can be seen most directly when the involution σ corresponds to a Hermitian symmetric space. In that case σ is inner and implemented by an element in a one-parameter subgroup exp tT contained in the center of Gσ. The innerness of σ implies that K contains a maximal torus of G, so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus S of elements exp tT is connected, since if x is any element in K there is a maximal torus containing x and S, which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains K since S is central in K and is contained in K since z lies in S. So K is the centralizer of S and hence connected. In particular K contains the center of G. For a general involution σ, the connectedness of Gσ can be seen as follows.See: The starting point is the Abelian version of the result: if T is a maximal torus of a simply connected group G and σ is an involution leaving invariant T and a choice of positive roots (or equivalently a Weyl chamber), then the fixed point subgroup Tσ is connected. In fact the kernel of the exponential map from \\\\mathfrak{t} onto T is a lattice Λ with a Z-basis indexed by simple roots, which σ permutes. Splitting up according to orbits, T can be written as a product of terms T on which σ acts trivially or terms T2 where σ interchanges the factors. The fixed point subgroup just corresponds to taking the diagonal subgroups in the second case, so is connected. Now let x be any element fixed by σ, let S be a maximal torus in CG(x)σ and let T be the identity component of CG(x, S). Then T is a maximal torus in G containing x and S. It is invariant under σ and the identity component of Tσ is S. In fact since x and S commute, they are contained in a maximal torus which, because it is connected, must lie in T. By construction T is invariant under σ. The identity component of Tσ contains S, lies in CG(x)σ and centralizes S, so it equals S. But S is central in T, to T must be Abelian and hence a maximal torus. For σ acts as multiplication by −1 on the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{t}\\\\ominus \\\\mathfrak{s}, so it and therefore also \\\\mathfrak{t} are Abelian. The proof is completed by showing that σ preserves a Weyl chamber associated with T. For then Tσ is connected so must equal S. Hence x lies in S. Since x was arbitrary, Gσ must therefore be connected. To produce a Weyl chamber invariant under σ, note that there is no root space \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\alpha on which both x and S acted trivially, for this would contradict the fact that CG(x, S) has the same Lie algebra as T. Hence there must be an element s in S such that t = xs acts non- trivially on each root space. In this case t is a regular element of T—the identity component of its centralizer in G equals T. There is a unique Weyl alcove A in \\\\mathfrak{t} such that t lies in exp A and 0 lies in the closure of A. Since t is fixed by σ, the alcove is left invariant by σ and hence so also is the Weyl chamber C containing it. =Conjugations on the complexification= Let G be a simply connected compact Lie group with complexification GC. The map c(g) = (g*)−1 defines an automorphism of GC as a real Lie group with G as fixed point subgroup. It is conjugate-linear on \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} and satisfies c2 = id. Such automorphisms of either GC or \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} are called conjugations. Since GC is also simply connected any conjugation c1 on \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} corresponds to a unique automorphism c1 of GC. The classification of conjugations c0 reduces to that of involutions σ of G because given a c1 there is an automorphism φ of the complex group GC such that :\\\\displaystyle{c_0=\\\\varphi\\\\circ c_1\\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1}} commutes with c. The conjugation c0 then leaves G invariant and restricts to an involutive automorphism σ. By simple connectivity the same is true at the level of Lie algebras. At the Lie algebra level c0 can be recovered from σ by the formula :\\\\displaystyle{c_0(X+iY)=\\\\sigma(X)- i\\\\sigma(Y)} for X, Y in \\\\mathfrak{g}. To prove the existence of φ let ψ = c1c an automorphism of the complex group GC. On the Lie algebra level it defines a self-adjoint operator for the complex inner product :\\\\displaystyle{(X,Y)=-B(X,c(Y)),} where B is the Killing form on \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathbf{C}}. Thus ψ2 is a positive operator and an automorphism along with all its real powers. In particular take :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi=(\\\\psi^2)^{1/4}} It satisfies :\\\\displaystyle{c_0c=\\\\varphi c_1 \\\\varphi^{-1} c=\\\\varphi cc_1 \\\\varphi=(\\\\psi^2)^{1/2} \\\\psi^{-1} =\\\\varphi^{-1} cc_1 \\\\varphi^{-1}=c \\\\varphi c_1\\\\varphi^{-1}=cc_0.} =Cartan decomposition in a real form= For the complexification GC, the Cartan decomposition is described above. Derived from the polar decomposition in the complex general linear group, it gives a diffeomorphism :\\\\displaystyle{G_{\\\\mathbf{C}} = G\\\\cdot \\\\exp i\\\\mathfrak{g} = G\\\\cdot P = P\\\\cdot G.} On GC there is a conjugation operator c corresponding to G as well as an involution σ commuting with c. Let c0 = c σ and let G0 be the fixed point subgroup of c. It is closed in the matrix group GC and therefore a Lie group. The involution σ acts on both G and G0. For the Lie algebra of G there is a decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{k} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{p}} into the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of σ. The fixed point subgroup K of σ in G is connected since G is simply connected. Its Lie algebra is the +1 eigenspace \\\\mathfrak{k}. The Lie algebra of G0 is given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{k} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{p}} and the fixed point subgroup of σ is again K, so that G ∩ G0 = K. In G0, there is a Cartan decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{G_0=K\\\\cdot \\\\exp i\\\\mathfrak{p} =K\\\\cdot P_0 = P_0\\\\cdot K} which is again a diffeomorphism onto the direct and corresponds to the polar decomposition of matrices. It is the restriction of the decomposition on GC. The product gives a diffeomorphism onto a closed subset of G0. To check that it is surjective, for g in G0 write g = u ⋅ p with u in G and p in P. Since c0 g = g, uniqueness implies that σu = u and σp = p−1. Hence u lies in K and p in P0. The Cartan decomposition in G0 shows that G0 is connected, simply connected and noncompact, because of the direct factor P0. Thus G0 is a noncompact real semisimple Lie group. Moreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra \\\\mathfrak{a} in \\\\mathfrak{p}, A = exp \\\\mathfrak{a} is a toral subgroup such that σ(a) = a−1 on A; and any two such \\\\mathfrak{a}'s are conjugate by an element of K. The properties of A can be shown directly. A is closed because the closure of A is a toral subgroup satisfying σ(a) = a−1, so its Lie algebra lies in \\\\mathfrak{m} and hence equals \\\\mathfrak{a} by maximality. A can be generated topologically by a single element exp X, so \\\\mathfrak{a} is the centralizer of X in \\\\mathfrak{m}. In the K-orbit of any element of \\\\mathfrak{m} there is an element Y such that (X,Ad k Y) is minimized at k = 1. Setting k = exp tT with T in \\\\mathfrak{k}, it follows that (X,[T,Y]) = 0 and hence [X,Y] = 0, so that Y must lie in \\\\mathfrak{a}. Thus \\\\mathfrak{m} is the union of the conjugates of \\\\mathfrak{a}. In particular some conjugate of X lies in any other choice of \\\\mathfrak{a}, which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of \\\\mathfrak{a}. A similar statements hold for the action of K on \\\\mathfrak{a}_0=i\\\\mathfrak{a} in \\\\mathfrak{p}_0. Morevoer, from the Cartan decomposition for G0, if A0 = exp \\\\mathfrak{a}_0, then :\\\\displaystyle{G_0=KA_0K.} =Iwasawa decomposition in a real form=See also *Real form (Lie theory) NotesReferences              Lie groups Lie algebras Algebraic groups Representation theory ","title":"Complexification (Lie group)"},{"id":"38635121","text":"Château de Tournoël Château de Tournoël The Château de Tournoël is a medieval fortified castle partly in ruins in the commune of Volvic, in the Puy-de-Dôme département of France.Ministry of culture listing: Château fort de Tournoël The castle is located on a rocky mountain spur at an altitude of 594 m in the foothills of the Puy de la Bannière which dominates the Limagne plains (about 350 m altitude above the level of Riom). The Château de Tournoël is privately owned and has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1889.  Strategic location  The castle, by dominating the Limagne plains, watched over the surroundings of the “bonne ville” (which means a town with a peculiar status with the king) of Riom which was the commercial and legal capital city of the Basse-Auvergne, and the royal Mozac Abbey. Therefore, Tournoël was, within a radius of 5 km, a seigniorial anti- establishment in this group of three consular, royal and religious powers. Its isolation on this volcanic overhang also ensured a better safety in case of withdrawal. Moreover, the castle was known to be “unassailable” or “impregnable, defended on the outside by extremely high slopes, very deep valleys, multiple towers and walls, filled with armed men and supplies” as described by William the Breton at the beginning of the 13th century. History=Bertrand of Tournoël= The castle’s early background is unknown because no document exists before the 11th century. The first documented owner of Tournoël dates back to between 1076 and 1096 and is in a document kept in the regional archives of the Puy-de-Dôme. In this certificate, Bertrannus (Bertrand in French), Lord of “Tournoile” (toponym at that time), had taken the church of Cébazat that he gave back to the cathedral chapter of Clermont. = Tournoël, property of the rulers of Auvergne = Arms of Guy II and of comtes d'Auvergne : or a gonfanon gueules frangé de vert The family of the rulers of Auvergne took possession of the castle at an unknown date. Guy II of Auvergne owned it from at least 1190. Whereas Guy II favored the claims of Richard the Lionheart to the Auvergne, his brother Robert, bishop of Clermont, sided with King Philip-Augustus. The tensions between the two brothers led to the imprisonment of Robert at Tournoël in 1199. At the end of 1212, the French king sent his army led by Guy of Dampierre, lord of Bourbon, who besieged and took the castle. Guy II lost almost all of his possessions in Auvergne, only keeping the region around Vic-le-Comte. Philip- Augustus ordered the restitution of the assets belonging to the Mozac Abbey. This event — the siege of Tournoël — allowed for the first time the annexation of the Basse-Auvergne to the crown lands. The territories seized by the king were called \\"lands of Auvergne\\". =A royal castle= Arms of Guy II de Dampierre : gueules two léopards or In 1213, Guy de Dampierre took possession of the castle for the king, to whom he sent an inventory of the castle in a letter dated 20 December 1213. Guy de Dampierre died on 18 January 1216. His son and successor, Archambaud VIII, retained ownership of Tournoël by the King's decision. Arms of Alphonse de Poitiers : parti d'azur semé de fleurs de lys d'or et de gueules semés de château d'or In 1225, King Louis VIII planned to convey his Auvergne possessions to his son Alphonse de Poitiers, who was made for the purpose Count of Auvergne. The County of Auvergne, just like the counties of Poitiers and Saintonge, was conceded as appanage. Alphonse took possession of the lands of Auvergne on his majority in 1241. The city of Riom became the capital of Lower Auvergne and, in 1270, Alphonse granted it a charter, called the \\"Alphonsine\\". Prince Alphonse stayed several times in his castle at Riom but also at Tournoël in 1251. Following his death in 1271, the land of Auvergne returned to the Crown of France. =The exchange with the heirs of Geraud Maulmont= Arms of the family of Maumont : azur, au sautoir or flanked byy four towers argent maçonnées sable In 1306, King Philip the Fair concluded an agreement with the heirs of Geraud Maulmont (or Maumont), a noble Limousin family who owned Saint-Julien-Maumont. Tournoël Châteauneuf and part of the lordship of Cébazat were exchanged for strategic places between Limousin and Périgord, such as Bourdeilles, Chalus Chabrol, Châlus Maulmont (both located in the present town of Chalus), to better counter the English domain of Aquitaine and thus strengthening the border. Pierre de Maumont officially became lord of Tournoël on 12 February 1313. He died in 1345 and had only one daughter, Martha, who took the castle to her husband, Gerald, lord of Roche Limousin. =The de La Roche family= Shield of the De La Roche family Géraud de La Roche died on an unknown date. His son Hugues de La Roche became the owner. Hugues In 1343, Hugues married Dauphine Rogier, the niece of Pope Clement VI and the sister of the future Pope Gregory XI. Thereby, Hugues became Rector of the Comtat Venaissin and Marshall of the Papal Court. In 1359, he was named Captain general of Basse-Auvergne and fought against England during the Hundred Years’ War. He died in 1398, with the title of Great Lord Chancellor of France. Hugues de La Roche reinforced the fortifications of the castle, especially the big circular 13th century keep, adding to it a chemin de ronde about two-thirds of its height, supported by machicolations. Nicolas His son, Nicolas de la Roche, took over from him in 1398. In 1404, he married Alix de Chauvigny, daughter of Chateau Rocher's lord. Their oldest son, Jean de La Roche, married Louise de La Fayette (daughter of Marshal Gilbert Motier de La Fayette) in 1419 and inherited Tournoël subject to an usufruct. He was killed during the Battle of Verneuil in August 1424 at the age of 22. He was survived by three children. When Nicolas died in 1428, his other sons claimed the property of Tournoël from Jean's widow. Château de Tournoël was sequestered by the seneschal until a judicial settlement. In 1429, the castle was given to the widow, Louise de La Fayette, and her children: the eldest, Antoine de La Roche, acquired the castle at the age of majority. Antoine Antoine de La Roche lived in Tournoël with Jeanne de Vieuville (cousin of Agnès Sorel) whom he had married in 1448. During this period the couple embellished the inside architecture of the fortress to change it into a residency. When the nobles rose up against Louis XI, creating the League of the Public Weal, Antoine de La Roche did not join Charles the Bold's followers. Louis XI rewarded him by naming him advisor and chamberlain of the court. A competition began between him and his suzerain, John II, Duke of Bourbon, who did participate in the League of the Public Weal. In 1478, as Antoine refused to give homage to him, John II of Bourbon sent him to jail in Moulins, then to the Conciergerie of Paris. The Duke of Bourbon put Tournoël under sequestration and his guards occupied it. On that occasion a detailed inventory of all furnitures was made. Two years later, in 1480, the Duke was ordered to return the castle to Antoine de La Roche by the Parliament of Paris but he seized it once again in 1487 giving as an excuse that people had been manhandled. One year later this seizure was nullified. Antoine died in 1493. Jean His son Jean succeeded him. He was the husband of Françoise Talaru (Foréz family). He died in 1501 leaving only a daughter: Charlotte Charlotte de la Roche de Tournoelle married in 1509 Jean d'Albon (b. 1472 - d. 1559), son of Guichard, lord of Saint-André and Anne de Saint-Nectaire. They had a daughter Marguerite, and two sons, Jacques (Marshal of France) and François (Bishop of Limoges).

The aviation policy was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by ASEAN Transport Ministers. The creation of the ASEAN- SAM was a key component of the road map for the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community. The ASEAN-SAM is expected to fully liberalize air travel between member states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN countries and airlines operating in the region to directly benefit from the growth in air travel around the world, and also freeing up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passengers services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalization of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalization on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect. The ASEAN single aviation market policy will supersede existing unilateral, bilateral and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.

The poem, The force that through the green fuse drives the flower, is known as the poem that \\"made Thomas famous\\", and also appears in the book. The poems are considered by many to be evocative but difficult to understand. Critic and contemporary of Thomas, Geoffrey Grigson, said that, regarding the influence of prominent poets on Thomas, the young poet was “untainted with Eliot or with Auden . . . whose poems, though a bit unintelligible, sounded at least familiar in an old grandiloquent way.” The poems in 18 poems are untitled and are often referred to by their first lines.

It is formed by the overlay of two strombolian cones and a tuff ring; it produced three lava flows during its eruptive history.  Geography  The Puy de Pariou is located about 10 km at the west of Clermont-Ferrand and a little more than 2 km from Orcines, at the south of the road that crosses the Col des Goules. The Puy des Goules is less than 400 meters north; the Cliersou, the Grand Suchet and the Petit Suchet are situated a few hundred meters west and south-west, and the Puy de Dôme lies about 1.5 km south. = Topography = Its highest point reaches 1,209 meters, 250 meters above the crystalline basement that forms the surrounding plain. It has a typical volcano shape of strombolian type, and its crater is formed by two craters, one nested in the other. The central crater, which is the highest and most recent, has an almost perfect circle shape. It descends 90 meters and a 200 meter diameter. The two craters are not on the same axis, contrary to those Puy de Côme. The Puy de Pariou is often compared to Mount Vesuvius, because of its recent cone topping a somma. The ancient crater, “old Pariou” and its prolongation by the tuff ring are still visible from the west and the north. It is hidden under the new crater, “new Pariou” at the south and under old lava flows at the east. The Puy de Pariou grounds are not fertile: they are punctuated by deciduous trees, junipers and a very short and thin grass.  Geology  Old Pariou is trachytic and trachybasaltic. These are black rocks and contain small augite, anorthite (bytownite and labradorite types) and olivine phenocrysts. This first cone is lengthened to the north by the trachyandesite tuff ring which caused its obstruction. These projections are dark and are composed of small andesine and hornblende crystals disseminated in a light brown volcanic glass. New Pariou is trachyandesitic. This rock is grey-bluish and contains anorthite (labradorite kind) and hornblendes trapped in volcanic glass comprising feldspar, pyroxene and olivine microlithes. The lava was very rich in gas, as showed by numerous bubbles elongated in the same direction as the flow. = History = The history of the Pariou started with the rising of the old Pariou, a strombolian cone where big explosions ejected trachytic products mixed to crystalline basement rubble. The magmatism became trachybasaltic and formed a lava flow in the south-west of the volcano. This flow spread over almost 2 km and reached the current location of Orcines. After that, a more explosive episode began, during which the old Pariou was almost completely hidden by a trachyandesitic tuff ring. Only a small part of the ancient strombolian cone remains visible, in the south, with the rest covered by the tuff ring. The ashes of this eruptive episode spread over a large region, at least until Clermont-Ferrand. A second strombolian cone appeared then, the new Pariou one, slightly acentric to the south. It covered all southern and east-southern parts of the old Pariou which remain visible and then forms a large trachyandesite flow to the east which covers the first trachybasalt flow. In Orcines, this second flow divides into two branches: one reaches the current location of Nohanent and the other one joins the Chamalières area, located at 8 km. This flow is estimated at 8580 years (± 350 years) thanks to radiocarbon dated wooden pieces. A lava lake formed temporarily between the bottom of the new Pariou and the borders of the tuff ring. It created a 200-meter hole in the east-northern border of the tuff ring, and then emptied, creating a small trachyandesitic lava flow. This flow is blocked in the North by the Puy des Goules, turns east and finally stopped at the current place called “Fontaine du Berger”.

Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo y Gayarre (30 April 1932 – 20 May 2016) was a Spanish reporter and Olympic athlete. He was the director and founder of cultural program Aventura 92 (Adventures 92), nowadays named as Ruta Quetzal BBVA. Although he was born in Madrid, he was always recognized as Basque-Navarre.  Biography = Early beginnings as a successful athlete = Miguel de la Quadra- Salcedo was born in Madrid on 30 April 1932. When he was a child, he went to live with his family in Pamplona, where he studied to be an agricultural expert and stood out as a great athlete. In the mid 50s Miguel and Félix Erausquin, a pitcher of the Basque bar, adapted the Basque technique to the throwing of Olympic javelin. In the manner of the disk or hammer, pitcher turns on itself before throwing. After much training, Miguel de la Quadra- Salcedo presented the \\"Spanish style\\" of throwing the javelin. The effectiveness was that high that in 1956 added 20 meters to the world record, which at the time was around 80. However, the record was never approved by the IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations). It thought that launch was too dangerous for the public because during the rotation the javelin tip was focused to them. He was nine times champion of Spain in the javelin, hammer and discus, being able to compete in the 1960 Rome Olympics. Between 1961 and 1963 he worked for the Colombian government as ethnobotany in the Amazon region. = First steps in the journalism world = Later he became a reporter for TVE, where would cover wars such as the Congo (he was sentenced to death for filming the execution of 300 prisoners), Vietnam, Eritrea and Mozambique and events such as the death of Che Guevara (1967) or the Pinochet coup in Chile (1973). Salvador Allende, Pablo Neruda, Indira Gandhi, Haile Selassie, Norodom Sihanouk, Yassir Arafat and the 14th Dalai Lama are among the personalities interviewed by him in his time as a reporter. He subsequently participated in programs such as Los reporteros (\\"The reporters\\") (with Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente, César Pérez de Tudela, Manu Leguineche and Jesús González Green) and Aventura 92 (\\"Adventure 92\\") (known in its current form as 'Ruta Quetzal'), consisting of the youth exchange students from Spain and Latin America to promote mutual understanding between the two sides of the Atlantic. Another program that he worked for was A la caza del tesoro (\\"Treasure Hunt\\"), presented by Isabel Tenaille: Miguel traveled by helicopter somewhere in the world following the instructions of a contestant who was in the studio in Madrid. = Ruta Quetzal = New Generations know him as a television character, always traveling the world or as a captain of Ruta Quetzal. The Ruta Quetzal was created suggested by the King of Spain in 1979, with the aim of strengthening the Latin American Community of Nations in the young people between 16 and 17 years old among all Spanish-speaking countries. For 15 years, 7,000 young Europeans and Americans have had the opportunity to discover different cultures as the old Mediterranean civilizations or pre- Columbian cultures. It is a journey of about one month and a half which is divided in two stages: an American and a Spanish itinerary. Approximately 350 young people from 50 countries study the history, geography and culture of the countries they explore by visiting historical places and participating in conferences that take place during the trip. The members of the expedition live together, share tents and coexist, sometimes in uncomfortable conditions, trying to create an environment of support and respect amongst each other. Since 1979 the route has covered more than 20 countries: Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Mexico, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Honduras and Costa Rica. Until 1992 the program was called Adventure 92 to commemorate the centenary of the discovery of America. Since 1993 the program is named Ruta Quetzal. The project is sponsored by the King of Spain, Juan Carlos I and it was declared in 1990 of universal interest by the UNESCO. Besides purely academic activities they are also workshops on new technologies, computer, television, journalism, photography, astronomy, diving, marine science, music and other subjects, as well as talks and discussion sessions on \\"Development Cooperation\\".

VXLAN endpoints, which terminate VXLAN tunnels and may be either virtual or physical switch ports, are known as VXLAN tunnel endpoints (VTEPs). VXLAN is an evolution of efforts to standardize on an overlay encapsulation protocol. It increases scalability up to 16 million logical networks and allows for layer 2 adjacency across IP networks. Multicast or unicast with head-end replication (HER) is used to flood broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) traffic. The VXLAN specification was originally created by VMware, Arista Networks and Cisco.

He was a member of a Spanish family long noted for their accomplishments in the world of painting. His brother was Nicolás Rodríguez Juárez (1667 - 1734), who was like himself, an established painter in New Spain. He was the son of Antonio Rodríguez (1636–91), a notable Spanish painter.

As with most artists in New Spain during the late Baroque period, Juan Rodríguez Juárez produced religious art. He also followed the trend of painting portraits of high officials, such as Viceroy Linares and the local nobility. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.

Its shareholders are ArianeGroup (90%) and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (10%). Sodern develops and produces instruments for space exploration missions or scientific programmes; satellite equipment; neutron generators and neutron interrogation tools. Since the 2000s, Sodern has participated in space exploration missions to Mars (NASA InSight, India Mars Orbiter, etc.), the moons of Jupiter (NASA Europa Clipper, ESA JUICE, etc.), Venus ( Japanese Mission \\"Planet C\\"), Ceres (NASA Dawn), the Moon, etc. It has developed high-tech scientific instruments including the heart of the PHARAO atomic clock, which should deviate by no more than one second every 300 million years, and will verify the effects predicted by the theory of general relativity. Sodern is the world leader in the development and production of star trackers, instruments that allow satellites to position themselves in space, and neutron tubes. Called a \\"key actor\\" of national defense by French minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, Sodern develops and produces the neutron sources for the French nuclear force, part of the payloads of the French military satellites dedicated to Earth observation , GPS-free positioning systems, etc. Franck Poirrier, CEO of Sodern, is the representative of the space equipment manufacturers within COSPACE (French Ministerial Committee of Space Coordination). History ASTRO-1 observatory Sodern was created in 1962 in the Philips' Laboratory of Electronics and Applied Physics (LEP) to launch a first generation of external neutron sources. In the late sixties, Sodern began to diversify its activities towards optical and high-tech space sensors, for which it is today the global leader. In the early 70s, on CNES demand, Sodern realized the first European Earth sensors, sensors dedicated to the attitude control of the experimental telecommunication satellite Symphonie (satellite). In 1975, the European Space Agency (ESA) subcontracted the manufacturing of multiple instruments for the Spacelab. Sodern achieved a high-precision scoring system dedicated to readjust the inertial and to high- performance attitude measurement. Sodern also delivered SED04 stars trackers for the Instrument Pointing System (IPS) of the Spacelab observatory. These sensors had a precision of 0.75 seconds of arc, thus the precision needed to see \\"a golf ball from a distance\\". Meanwhile, in the mid-1990s, Sodern enhanced its optical instrumentation activity dedicated to Space. Activity Although Sodern activity started in the neutron area, by designing neutron sources for the French deterrent force, it began to diversify into optical sensors and advanced spacecraft instrumentation in the late 1960s. =Spatial Instrumentation= Nowadays, its activities cover several ranges of space instruments. \\\\- Instruments for satellite attitude control: Earth and Solar sensors and stars trackers, equipping among others Spot, Helios, Eurostar satellites and M51 missile. The first Earth sensor was created in 1977 and boarded on Meteosat I. \\\\- Instruments for Earth observation (cameras, optical and optronic instruments for Spot satellites, Helios, Envisat, etc.). \\\\- Advanced optical instruments for the nuclear industry, the French deterrence force and scientific research, for example Astrium ATV videometers, that can guide its automatic docking to the International Space Station (ISS), and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument for MetOp. \\\\- Unique scientific instruments created on demand and integrated aboard satellites, space stations and space vehicles, such as PHARAO atomic clock (developed from the work of the Nobel Laureate Claude Cohen-Tannoudji), critical liquids on DECLIC orbit study instruments, some of the main components of the camera seeking for exoplanets aboard COROT satellite, etc. Stars Trackers As a Star trackers worldwide leader, Sodern takes in 75% of the global market with two other European leaders, Galileo (Italy) and Jena Optronik (Germany). SED16 sensor has been the first to be used to replace gyroscopes in satellites. It was launched for the first time in May 2002 aboard Spot 5. It has since flown with numerous satellites, including the US communication satellite AMC 12 on February 2005. SED26, his almost similar successor, was launched on April 2005 aboard the satellite Apstar VI. The U.S. probe Dawn, that was made to visit two asteroids Vesta and Ceres, locates itself thanks to SED16 sensors. Those sensors are, within all Sodern's supplied equipment, those farthest from Earth in deep Space. The SED26 sensor guides, among others, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle ATV, the satellites Helios 2, Orbview 3 and 4, Sorce (from the American manufacturer Orbital), and more than a dozen satellites of the Russian manufacturer ISS- Reshetnev. Hydra Star Tracker June 15, 2005, Sodern announced the development and production of Hydra sensors, more accurate, more compact and lighter than the SED. Development of the sensor was funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and The French Space Agency (CNES), and resulted in a radiation- resistant sensor, about half as heavy as the SED (which were 3Kg weight), which consumes only one Watt while operating and which has a precision of one arc second on each of its three axes. Sodern has sold more than a hundred of Hydra sensors so far, first of which was launched on September 6, 2012 aboard the French satellite Spot 6. =Optical Instrumentation= In the late 60s, several projects in optical instrumentation have been materialized, such as the strips, bands incorporating all the data exchanged during the operations of air traffic control, as well as the prototype of a mini-camera for the French hospital Val-de-Grâce, detecting gamma and beta rays, to facilitate complete removal of cancerous tumours. During the 1980s, Sodern designed the focal plans and the optics for the Meris instrument of the European Space Agency satellite Envisat, provided the cameras for the programs Iasi (CNES) and CALIPSO (CNES/NASA), and the dioptric objective of the Corot instrument, which doesn't observe the Earth but looks into Space searching for exoplanets or studying the seismic activity of the stars. By producing Spot1's camera in 1986 (DTA01), Sodern began a long participation in Earth observation programs, providing cameras as much as optical and optronic instruments for the satellites ranges Spot, Helios, Envisat, etc. Strip Filters Strip Filters Optical instrumentation and space being often linked, Sodern has developed a new generation of multi-spectral filters, \\"strip filters\\". The acquisition on multiple spectral bands is enabled by the use of multiple elementary optical filters juxtaposed to each other. Regarding the technology developed by Sodern, this juxtaposition is obtained by assembly of strips, the strip being a sub-set containing all the functions of an elementary filter. The final component is called \\"assembled strip filter\\". The number of elementary filters and their characteristics (centring, width, rejection, sloping edges, etc.) depend on the type of the satellite (Earth observation in the visible, infrared, etc.). =Neutron= In the 1980s, Sodern has developed its civil neutron activity and designed neutron generators (TN26 then GENIE36) used by radioactive waste reprocessing plants for the measurement of transuranic elements. It's also used for in situ measurements in mining and oil logging, for the control of raw materials in metallurgy, for the detection of explosives and in neutron radiography. In the early 1990s, a first neutron- flanged tube for the oil logging (electrical logging) was designed at the request of Schlumberger, first of an ongoing collaboration. Cement CNA In the late 1990s, a new project of neutron analyzer was launched, the Continuous Neutron Analyzer (CNA) for the analysis of cements. The principle of material analysis by neutron interrogation was then extended for a vast range of applications: coal, ores (copper, nickel, bauxite, iron), scrap and waste. In 2010, about 70 of those devices had been sold, mostly to cement makers. These CNAs are marketed by another company, PANalytical. Based on the same principle of analysis, Sodern designed INES, a detector of explosives for luggage at airports. This detector was developed jointly with the French Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA). It has used a technology called FNA, for Fast Neutron Activation, different from its American competitor (Science Applications International Corp.) technology, which is called TNA, for Thermal Neutron Activation. Sodern FNA detector was based on the fact that explosives often contain a large amount of oxygen and nitrogen but little carbon. A pulsed generator of neutrons then enabled it to detect such elements. The detector was able to analyze 1200 bags per hour, for a detection rate of 99.8%. It has not yet been commercialized. THOR (military version) and ULIS (civilian version) emerged in the 1990s. They make the detection of explosive and hazardous materials (toxic chemicals products), as illegal ones, possible in abandoned luggage and parcels, from a distance. Their small size allows them to be carried like a suitcase. NIPPS (Neutron Induced Prompt Photometer System) allows the non-intrusive detection of illicit and dangerous substances. It has been used by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons(OPCW). Management The main shareholder (90%) has been the European company ArianeGroup, the remaining 10% being held by the French Atomic Energy Commission CEA. In 2017, the company employed about 400 people, including around 60% of engineers.

The Poppy Fields scored a hit with the release of \\"45 RPM\\" that would become The Alarm's first hit in over a decade. Mike Peters revealed the truth on live radio as Radio 1 was conducting a 2004 broadcast of their then current chart countdown. The story was highlighted by international news outlets with several headlines being published globally. Immediately after exposing the hoax, the music video for \\"45 RPM\\" was replaced by an edited version that included The Alarm's members alongside the hyped members of The Poppy Fields. Peters had enticed a young band called the Wayriders to lip-sync the song for the music video while posing as members of the nonexistent group. The events surrounding this hoax have spawned the cinematic release of Vinyl, its soundtrack, The Alarm Vinyl Tour 2013, and the subsequent announcement of a 2013 tour by The Alarm in support of the soundtrack.  Hoax  In an interview with BBC News Online, Mike Peters said \\"The Alarm, most famous for their 1983 hit '68 Guns', were not always taken seriously by DJs\\" because of a combination of the age of the band's members and a perception that their image was outdated. Peters said, \\"The Alarm as an entity have been going for 20-odd years and history can go against you - we wanted to break the barrier down.\\" He continued by saying that \\"[The Alarm members] wanted to stir up the water a little bit, break the mould\\" and have the song judged on its own merits and musical value, instead of judgement being based on the perception of the band. Peters told The Guardian: \\"We noticed that a lot of bands suffer when they attempt comebacks because people generally don't believe they can ever be as good as they once were. We wanted to make sure we are judged purely on the strength of the music, and not by our old hairstyles.\\" = The Poppy Fields = With The Alarm's decision to perpetrate the hoax, Mike Peters gained the cooperation of a group of young musicians from Chester called the Wayriders to lip-sync The Alarm's material and pass it off as their own. The first release by the fictitious band was promoted as a cover of The Alarm's 1983 hit, \\"68 Guns\\". In fact it was The Alarm all along, and instead of a cover, it was a re-released version. The demo enticed executives in music production to record an album from the band called In The Poppy Fields which saw its advance release of the single, \\"45 RPM\\" entering Britain's top 30 chart. Critical reviews of the band echoed the promoters' official introduction of the band as a tribute to bands like Sex Pistols, and The Clash, with even more modern acts like Rancid being compared. The truth of the song's origin was not revealed until after the song entered the charts at number 24, a credit originally earned by The Poppy Fields from unsuspecting patrons who had accepted the act as fresh and new.  Vinyl  Filming for Vinyl began in the Denbighshire resort town of Rhyl in August 2010. Vinyls soundtrack features new songs by The Alarm specifically composed for the film including the cinematic anthem, \\"Free Rock And Roll\\", recorded by The Alarm with Vinyls leading actor, Phil Daniels, in a song with The Alarm's lead vocalist and founding member, Mike Peters. The song was released as an EP single on 28 January 2013 in tandem with a national television campaign featuring both the film's cast and members of The Alarm.

Early life and education Patten was born in New York City on June 5, 1924. She was one of two children of Willam Francis and Elsa Brainin Wholly who ran an office furnishings business in New York City and maintained an upper-class standard of living. She attended the Fox Hollow School for girls in Lenox, Massachusetts, as well as The Hewitt School in New York City. At age ten, a friend of her parents, the American sculptor Gutzon Borglum, suggested she study with the American sculptor Harriet Whitney Frishmuth; she studied with him for the next six years. She finished her formal education at the Columbia University Graduate School of Art (1946-1950) where she studied art with a concentration in sculpture under Oronzio Meldarelli and Doug Kingman. After her formal training, she continued with sculpted portraiture and was commissioned to make several bronze portraits of various US personalities. She also fashioned bas relief portraits which she then reduced from full-size to miniatures, to be used as medals and pendants. Family life In 1947 she married William V. Patten in New York City, and had two sons. The family soon traded New York City for Guatemala City. In 1963, Joan's husband moved to Guatemala City with his eldest son to work for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) s, and was hired by R.O.C.A.P. to do research on marketing and natural resources. she followed with her second son in 1965. Work in Guatemala She began to explore the ancient heritage and native Maya of Guatemala. Becoming fascinated by the Classic Maya sculpture in the many nearby ancient Maya ruins, she began investigating the ancient art. In these early years, tourists were allowed at some ruins to make rubbings of stone monuments. So as a pastime, she made rubbings (or calcos as they were called) of carvings located on a friend's finca. Joan and a companion were later allowed to make a few rubbings of Monuments at Tikal and she found that her sculptor's touch and eye were well suited for the craft. While practicing rubbings, Joan became intrigued by the idea of fashioning molds of the stones and creating replicas. It occurred to her that, as a sculptor, she could put her talents to good use and help preserve the nation's cultural treasures that were under constant threat due to exposure to the elements and theft. With the help of her husband's connections, Patten suggested to the government authorities that they make casts of the monuments to preserve and protect Maya sculpture. Officials agreed, and she quickly found herself elected to do the job. The director of INGUAT (National Tourist Office of Guatemala) became enthused with the idea of monument reproductions and helped Joan to obtain the proper government permissions to start the task. Over the next decade, she became the only Guatemalan authorized agent to make official reproductions from any Maya site. The reproduction of Maya monuments soon became the dominant passion of her life and she would spend the next seventeen years (until 1982 when she returned to the United States) pursuing opportunities to cast replicas of Maya sculpture. Restoration efforts Patten donated the casts she made to the Guatemalan government as well as her time and expertise. When the 1976 Guatemala earthquake occurred, many of the ancient monuments housed in museums were broken. Joan was called in and asked if she could help restore the monuments. She gladly accepted the offer and was able to make molds of the stelae broken parts. These pieces were then fitted together into a new mold that was later fashioned to make an unbroken replica. Through the years, the Guatemala Museum of History and Anthropology received seventy of Patten's reproductions and the Popol Vuh Museum received approximately fifteen sculptures. Today, many of these casts are on display along a garden pathway within Francisco Marroquín University adjoining the Popol Vuh Museum. Rubbings As Joan made molds, she in turn made rubbings from the original work; these were fashioned before and after casting to record that no harm had come to the stone. Having the governmental permission but little monies to support the work, she began to sell the rubbings to finance more expeditions into more Maya sites and she soon became one of the best practitioners of this art. However, she always considered the calcos merely a side-line to her main work as a sculptor. Traditionally, rubbings have been made by tamping or rubbing black inks or waxes on white rice paper which are stretched over carved stone, wood or metal. With rice paper hard to come by, Joan used oil pigments lightly tamped on stretched dyed cloth. The combination of coloured fabrics and inks produced a polychromatic blueprint of the carved relief with crisp, well-defined lines outlining both figures and hieroglyphic passages. Although Patten made rubbings from the original surface of every monument she made a replica of, a majority of duplicate rubbings were fashioned directly from the replicas. Rubbings from the second generation casts had several advantages. First, there was no chance of harming the original stone. Also, the cast possessed a clean, tight surface free of additional wear from lichen and plant growth. Perhaps the best gain was that she could fashion a rubbing in the studio in a controlled environment (sheltered from the rain, sun and mosquitoes). In the studio she could take all the time needed to coax and transfer details of figures and hieroglyphs onto the cloth. Many times she had the added advantage of making a rubbing while looking at another cast of the same monument. The end result produced features that were telegraphed onto the cloth surface with crisp, well defined lines. The finished work often looked more like a painting or a batik than a traditional rubbing. The corpus of Patten rubbings number approximately nine hundred prints and range from single glyphic blocks to full altars and stelae. By 29 November 1985, the Guatemalan Congress enacted a law restricting the creation of molds and rubbings of monuments. With this law, Joan's famous permission to make replicas came to an end.

The improved suspension system of LHB coaches ensures more riding comfort for the passengers compared to conventional rakes. The air conditioning system of the LHB coaches is of higher capacity compared to the older rakes and is controlled by a microprocessor which is said to give passengers better comfort than the older coaches during summer and winter seasons. They are relatively quieter as each coach can produce a maximum noise level of 60 decibels while conventional coaches can produce 100 decibels. Each LHB coach costs between Rs 15 million to 20 million, whereas the power car which houses a generator costs about 30 million. Similar Train The South Eastern Railway (SER) also runs a train along this route with the same name along with Non-AC Sleeper Coaches. The 22849/50 Shalimar - Secunderabad Superfast Express is a weekly superfast express train of the Indian Railways operated by SER. Since it is run by SER which is headquartered in West Bengal, the train's base is at Kolkata. The up train departs Shalimar every Wednesday at 12:20 pm and arrives at Secunderabad every Thursday at 3:00 pm. The down train departs Secunderabad every Friday at 5:30 am and arrives at Shalimar every Saturday at 9:05 am. The up train departs exactly three hours and forty-five minutes before the AC express. The down train shares the same times lot as the AC Superfast run by SCR.

It runs from Munich East station via Markt Schwaben and Dorfen to Mühldorf. The travel time between Munich East and Mühldorf is currently about an hour. The track is one of the 18 bottlenecks with capacity problems identified under the Bundesschienenwegeausbaugesetz (Federal Railway Infrastructure Development Act) of 1993. In particular the section between Markt Schwaben and Ampfing is one of the busiest single-track lines in Germany. About 3 million tonnes is handled on this single-track, non- electrified route; this is more than one percent of Germany's total rail freight task and in 2015 it will probably be more than two percent. Current operations  The 21.1 km of line between Munich East and Markt Schwaben is double track and electrified. Between München-Riem West junction and Markt Schwaben the Munich S-Bahn does not have separate tracks and so S-Bahn trains have to share the line. The line speed there is currently 140 km/h and in places only 120 km/h. Electrification ends at Markt Schwaben. The 45 km of line between Markt Schwaben and Ampfing is only single track despite substantial passenger and freight traffic. The section from Ampfing to Altmühldorf has been doubled; work was completed in December 2010 at a cost of around € 50 million. Ampfing station was redesigned as part of this project and received two new exterior platforms and was made fully accessible for the disabled. In addition, the entire upgraded section has been rebuilt with flying junctions to remove at grade crossings; some of this work was done years ago. The final section between Altmühldorf and Mühldorf is only single- track. The infrastructure manager is DB Netz AG, with the exception of Mühldorf station, which is managed by Südostbayernbahn (SOB), a subsidiary of DB Regio GmbH. Südostbayernbahn operates Regionalbahn and Regional-Express passenger trains made up of class 245 locomotives and class 218 locomotives normally hauling double-deck carriages (some carriages are refurbished Silberling or former InterRegio carriages) or class 628 railcars. In the peak hours, trains run every 20 minutes in order to convey about 15,000 commuters each day, otherwise they run largely hourly. Some stations are not usually served: Weidenbach (served four times a day each way), Walpertskirchen (about every two hours) and Thann-Matzbach (about twelve times a day each way). Two trains a day run non-stop in about 45 minutes between Mühldorf and Munich East. The Munich S-Bahn's line S 2 (Petershausen–Dachau–Munich–Markt Schwaben–Erding) operates partly over the line using class 423 electric multiple units. Freight traffic is operated, alongside some traffic operated by private companies, by the DB subsidiary DB Schenker Rail with locomotives of class 247. Classes 217, 225 and 232 and 233 had been used before. In particular, freight from the “Bavarian Chemical Triangle” (Bayerisches Chemiedreieck, around Mühldorf) provides a significant volume of freight traffic. Overall, this makes the Markt Schwaben–Mühldorf section (excluding the approximately 8 km long section between Ampfing and Altmühldorf) one of the busiest single-track lines in Germany: it now carries about 3 million tonnes, more than 1 percent of Germany's freight transported by rail; by 2015 an estimated 2 percent rail freight are carried on this single-track, non- electrified line. The dispatchers at the local stations between Markt Schwaben and Mühldorf are kept busy. The stations of Dorfen and Mühldorf possess electronic interlockings and are equipped with Ks signals (the new system of line-side signalling that has been introduced in Germany since 1993). Ampfing station is equipped with the Ks signals that are controlled by the electronic interlocking centre in Dorfen. Between Markt Schwaben (inclusive) and Munich, the H/V system of signalling (the normal system, first used in 1924) is in operation. The rest of the line has a form of signalling that is over 100 years old. Development plans The Munich-Mühldorf line has been included in the Federal Transport Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) since 1985 as part of the development of the Munich–Mühldorf–Freilassing route. The line will in the long term be doubled and electrified, largely using the existing alignment. Only the section between Dorfen and Ampfing would need to be partially realigned to give a continuous design speed of 160 km/h, as the current curves only permit a speed of 120 km/h. This realignment, like the long-planned four- track upgrade to Markt Schwaben and the connection from the New Munich Trade Fair via an S-Bahn link, has apparently not been pursued since 2010. However, the route from Mühldorf to Munich via the so-called Walpertskirchener Spange (Walpertskirchen link) directly to Munich Airport is still planned to greatly improve transport links, especially from eastern and south-eastern Bavaria and Upper Austria and the state of Salzburg to the airport. Ampfing station in January 2015 - view towards Mühldorf The following double track section between Ampfing and Altmühldorf was finished in December 2010 and the 2.2 km section between Altmühldorf and Mühldorf is planned to be duplicated as part of the upgrade of the Mühldorf–Tüßling route, supported with funds from the second economic stimulus package, which is due to be completed in 2016. So far, however, only funds for planning the development have been made available. In addition, two passing points are to be developed as a priority between Markt Schwaben and Hörlkofen (8 km) and between Dorfen and Obergeislbach (11.6 km). However, no planning has been done for this, so realisation before 2020 or even 2025 is unrealistic. The route from Mühldorf to Freilassing has also been proposed for duplication and electrification since 1985. The branch line from Tüßling to Burghausen would also be electrified as part of this work. The entire Munich–Mühldorf–Freilassing route would be used as an alternative to the Munich–Rosenheim and Rosenheim–Salzburg lines, especially to deal with the expected volume of traffic after the completion of the Brenner Base Tunnel. The line is part of the Magistrale for Europe, which is almost identical with the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) project No. 17, the upgrade of the Paris–Strasbourg–Stuttgart–Munich–Vienna–Bratislava/Budapest railway axis. While the TEN project between Paris and Bratislava will be almost completed by 2020, on the Munich–Mühldorf–Freilassing section there have been significant planning delays. This section is the longest missing link on the over 1300 km long route between Paris and Bratislava. The proposed measures would allow a considerable reduction in travel time for local and long-distance traffic and substantial improvements for regional services in southeast Bavaria (integrated regular interval services). Moreover, the industrial enterprises of the Bavarian Chemical Triangle have demanded for quite some time an upgrade of the outdated and congested railway lines. They are also listed as priorities in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan in order to improve transport links with Austria. The upgrade of the Munich–Mühldorf–Freilassing route has been estimated to cost € 1.386 billion (as of November 2010). The line would be upgraded for a design speed of between 120 and 160 km/h and the journey time on the Munich–Mühldorf–Salzburg route (147 km) would be halved from the current minimum of 150 minutes to 74 minutes. In comparison, the Munich–Rosenheim–Salzburg route is 153 km long and the Austrian Federal Railways Railjet runs over this route non-stop in 89 minutes.

Most known as main-engineer of Fordson tractor. Early life and education Farkas was born in Kald, Hungary. He was the second eldest son of Karoly and Anna Farkas, and one of ten children. Karoly was a wagon builder. The family moved to Jánoshalma in 1886 and later moved on to Szarvas. Eugene attend six years of compulsory school plus four years of military school and then moved on to the Budapest Gymnasium (like High School). Through the support and kindness of a maternal uncle he was able to afford to attend the Royal Joseph Technical University, from which he graduated with a degree in Certified Mechanical Engineering. Career After qualifying at university Farkas completed one year of military service after which he worked in a motorcycle factory, unpaid, in order to get experience. In 1906 Farkas and a friend left Hungary to travel to the United States. With only 17 words of English the young Hungarian landed in New York where he read the situations vacant and secured a position with Maxwell-Briscoe in Tarrytown, New York. After six months, during which Farkas had taken English lessons he decided he wanted to work in innovative motor vehicle design, to this end he wrote to Ford and Packard. Walter Flanders of Ford replied and in September 1907 Farkas started to work for Ford. This was not a long lived position because Farkas was not employed as an experimental draughtsman, after only two months Farkas moved on to work for Cadillac but due to the Panic of 1907 Farkas was soon out of work. He started work with the Morgan Engineering Co., in Alliance, Ohio where yet again the Panic of 1907 caused him to lose his job. Early 1908, saw Farkas back at Ford working on the design of tools and fixtures for the Model T. An unfortunate altercation with a fellow employee, named Haltenberger, caused Farkas to be dismissed. He went on to work for many other great names in the American motor industry: Packard, Oldsmobile, Oakland, Rapid Motor Vehicle Company, Cartercar Company and Hudson. When General Motors bought out the Cartercar company on October 26, 1909 Farkas became the chief engineer for Cartercar, a position he held for three years. Moving on once again, Farkas went to work for the Cass Motor Vehicle Co. designing trucks, but this was not a long-term future for the young Hungarian. By 1911, Farkas was living in Pontiac, Livingston County, Illinois, where he married Helen Louise Parshall. The couple had four sons: Raymond Zoltan (born 1912), Louis Eugen (born 1914), Don Earl (born 1917) and Robert Lawrence (born 1919). By 1913 Farkas had returned to work for Ford and the family had moved to Detroit. On October 1, 1915 Charles Sorenson had been asked by Henry Ford to oversee the development of a Ford tractor, a new design away from the converted Model T, which had been produced. Sorenson chose Eugene Farkas as his chief engineer for the project. Farkas was innovative in his designs, following the Wallis Tractor Co example of frameless construction, he improved the principle and set an industry standard which lasts to the modern day. The three-speed transmission was specifically designed by Farkas for the rigours of agriculture. Final drive was by worm gear, which was another Farkas design. Farkas was involved in the war effort of Ford during World War I. In 1918, he designed an aircraft engine and he was involved in early US military tank design. He worked on the Ford X configuration engine, which was a favorite of Henry Ford, but which was not a great success. Using expertise honed on such projects Farkas also worked on the Model A B-24 bomber and a 12 cylinder radial aircraft engine. The latter was never built. Retirement and death By 1947, Farkas had completed his engineering career. He and Helen moved to Laguna Beach, Orange County, California to retire. They were both keen dancers, Eugene occasionally entertained Henry Ford with a traditional Hungarian dance. Eugene enjoyed fishing and playing the flute or piccolo. Farkas died on February 24, 1963. His widow Helen Louise Farkas (née Parshall) died on November 11, 1974.

As of February 2001, Cheung is ranked no. 359 in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). Cheung is also left-handed, and uses the offensive, shakehand grip. Table tennis career Representing his adopted nation Hong Kong, Cheung made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in both the singles and doubles tournament. For his first event, the men's doubles, Cheung and his partner Leung Chu Yan won the preliminary pool round against Greece's Kalinikos Kreanga and Ntaniel Tsiokas, and Australia's Simon Gerada and Mark Smythe, attaining two victories, four games, and a total score of 98 points. The Hong Kong pair progressed to the knock-out stage, but they narrowly lost to the South Korean duo Ryu Seung-Min and Lee Chul-Seung, with a set score of 2–3. In the men's singles, Cheung defeated Brazil's Hugo Hoyama and Canada's Kurt Liu for a spot on the knock-out stage, by placing first in the preliminary pool round, with two victories and a score of 182 points. Cheung, however, lost the first round for the second time to Japan's Koji Matsushita, receiving a unanimous set score of 0–3. At the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, Cheung and his partner Tie Ya Na defeated the host nation's Ryu Seung-Min and Ryu Ji-Hae for the gold medal in the mixed doubles, with a sudden death set score of 3–4. Two years later, Cheung qualified for the men's doubles at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by being selected as one of the top 8 seeded teams chosen from ITTF. Reuniting with his partner Leung Chu Yan, Cheung lost the third preliminary round match of the men's doubles to Russian duo Dmitry Mazunov and Alexei Smirnov, with a unanimous set score of 0–4. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Cheung qualified for his third Hong Kong team, as a 39-year-old, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, by claiming the men's singles title from the Final World Qualification Tournament in Budapest, Hungary. Cheung joined with his fellow players and former rivals Ko Lai Chak and Li Ching for the inaugural men's team event. He and his team placed second in the preliminary pool round, earning a total of six points, two victories (against Nigeria and Russia), and a single defeat from the Japanese trio Yo Kan, Seiya Kishikawa, and Jun Mizutani.

Career She began her career at L'Oréal before moving on to a public relations role at Compagnie Générale des Eaux. = Boss Sporting = From 2000 until 2006, she organized rare animal hunts at Boss Sporting, a subsidiary of the London based gun-making firm Boss & Co. It was in this capacity that she was introduced to Juan Carlos I of Spain by Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster in 2004. The King of Spain subsequently hired her to arrange the honeymoon of his son Felipe, Prince of Asturias and his new bride Princess Letizia. Between 2004 and 2005, the monarch hired her to organize two hunting safaris, including an elephant hunt at the Duke of Westminster's estate in Botswana in 2012. = Apollonia Associates = In 2006, she founded a consulting firm called Apollonia Associates that advises businesses and governments.Natalia Junqera, \\"Operación Corinna zu Sayn- Wittgenstein\\", El País (27 February 2013). She relocated to Monaco where she became an advisor to Princess Charlene. In 2013, Albert II, Prince of Monaco, appointed her as a global trade envoy for the principality. She is one of the people named in the Paradise papers disclosure published in the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. In 2012, approximately $65 million (€57 million) was allegedly transferred from an account to zu Sayn-Wittgenstein- Sayn. Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn told investigators that the money was a donation from the former Spanish monarch, whom Swiss prosecutors name as the first beneficiary of the Mirabaud bank account. Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn told investigators that the money paid for the refurbishment work at an Eaton Square apartment in London. These refurbishments cost around £4 million pounds (€4,340,055). In August 2020, she was part of an investigation regarding a Saudi rail deal during the late-2010s, and a series of financial transactions involving Juan Carlos I of Spain. Personal life In 1989, she met Philip Adkins, a British businessman. They were married in 1990 and in 1992, they had a daughter, Anastasia. They were divorced three years later, in 1995. On October 26, 2000, she married Casimir, Prince zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, nine years her junior, in London. In 2002, she and Prince Casimir had a son, Prince Alexander Kyril. They divorced in 2005 and she retained her married name. In 2015 she purchased a home (which she reportedly told Swiss prosecutors was for her son) at Chyknell Hall at Claverley, Shropshire, where she has been resident since.Comment and Analysis report by Mark Andrews. = Relationship with Juan Carlos I = She became the mistress of Spanish King Juan Carlos I in 2004. News of her relationship with the King made international headlines in April 2012. She arranged and accompanied the monarch on an elephant-hunting safari at the Duke of Westminster's estate in Botswana. The elephant-hunting trip she arranged came at an expense of €40,000 which was paid by Mohammed Eyad Kayali, advisor to the Saudi royal family, who, like Corinna, was named in the 2016 Panama Papers as the head of 15 offshore companies. When the King fell, broke his hip and had to have emergency surgery, their affair was exposed via increased media scrutiny. In 2012, King Juan Carlos transferred around €65m to her as 'a gift'.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53749630?utm_source=pocket-newtab- global-en-GB  Titles and styles  * 1964-1990 Miss Corinna Larsen * 1990-2000 Mrs. Philip Atkins * 2000-2005 Her Serene Highness Princess Casimir of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn * 2005-present Ms. Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn  See also  * List yields of Danish women in business * 2020 Saudi rail deal investigation References 1965 births Living people People from Frankfurt German people of Danish descent Corinna German princesses Princesses by marriage German philanthropists Monegasque philanthropists People named in the Panama Papers Mistresses of Spanish royalty ","title":"Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn"},{"id":"38636046","text":"McGillivray is a surname.

It has a wedge-shaped body that is 10–12 mm long (adult male) or 12–14 mm long (adult female). The head is black with cream or white maxillary plates. The pronotum and scutellum are black. The tegmen is black with a blue or purple tinge, and one to three white fasciae. The costal margin is black. Legs are scarlet close to the body and black further away. Underparts are scarlet. E. distincta mainly feeds on the bangalay (Eucalyptus botryoides) and the apple box (Eucalyptus bridgesiana), though it has also been recorded on manna gum (E. viminalis), black gum (E. aggregate) and Camden woollybutt (E. macarthurii). Nymphs and adults may be attended by up to 20 ants of the genus Iridomyrmex, which also attend female scale insects of the species Eriococcus coriaceus and E. confusus that infest the same trees. The ants eat the leaf- hoppers' sugary excrement, or \\"honeydew\\". Field observations in Bungendore, New South Wales, showed that E. distincta reproduces once a year in the austral spring, with a single breeding pair occupying a tree. Mating takes place between September and October, with eggs laid from October to December. The females cut a slit lengthwise down a 1.5–3.8 cm diameter branch, lay around 12 eggs, and cover securely with a \\"white frothy secretion\\". The eggs are slender and around 2mm long. Larvae begin hatching in November and become adults in February. The vulnerable pronymph is transparent with red eyes, and transforms into the nymph before it finishes emerging from the bark (and egg). Its abdomen splits and the nymph emerges, becoming black in around 15 minutes and commencing to feed. The nymphs then gather in large numbers around the base of new growth on the branches and feed. There are five stages (instars) of nymph: the first instar resembles a black spider with red eyes and white belly, while the second gains the red abdomen of the adult and has a more elongated body. Eurymela distincta has been recorded from Sydney and Bombala, New South Wales, Nunawading, Victoria, and Hobart, Tasmania. Adults generally hibernate over winter, though may come out on warm sunny days. Summer hailstorms or very cold winters can kill them. The eggs are parasitised by two species of mymarid wasps, and one dryinid wasp of the genus Anteon.  Classification  The species was described in 1850 by French entomologist Victor Antoine Signoret, who described Eurymela vicina at the same time. British entomologist Francis Walker described E. speculum in 1851 from several specimens that had been sent to the British Museum. In 1852, he updated the latter two species as synonyms of E. distincta. In 1906, George Willis Kirkaldy described E. lubra from a specimen he collected in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, which he reported differed from E. distincta by virtue of its red abdomen. In 1908, William Lucas Distant wrote that Kirkaldy should have already known that the abdomen of E. distincta was red, as although Signoret failed to mention it, subsequent authors had, and hence Distant made E. lubra a synonym of E. distincta.

In 1971, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Islami Chhatra Sangha. After liberation he went to Pakistan and worked for Radio Pakistan. Later, he moved to New York and presently heads the Queens branch of Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA). He was sentenced to death in absentia by the International War Crimes Tribunal for killing 18 Bengali intellectuals during the last days of the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh. Activities as a commander of Al Badr Ashrafuzzaman Khan shot to death seven teachers of Dhaka University in the killing zones at Mirpur. Mofizzuddin, who drove the vehicle that carried those victims to Mirpur, clearly identified Ashrafuzzaman as the \\"chief killer\\" of the intellectuals. After 1971 War After Liberation, Ashrafuzzaman's personal diary was recovered from his residence, 350 East Nakhalpara. Two pages of his diary registered names and residential addresses of 19 teachers as well as the name of the medical officer of Dhaka University. Of those 20 persons, 8 were missing on December 14: Munier Chowdhury (Bengali), Dr. Abul Khair (History), Ghiasuddin Ahmed (History), Rashidul Hasan (English), Dr. Faizul Mohi (IE R) and Dr. Murtaza (Medical Officer). Mofizuddin confessed that Ashrafuzzaman himself shot all of them. As per Mofizuddin's description, the decomposed bodies of those unfortunate teachers were recovered from the swamps of Rayer Bazar and the mass grave at Shiyal Bari at Mirpur. There were also other names in the diary including Dr. Wakil Ahmed (Bengali), Dr. Nilima Ibrahim (Bengali), Dr. Latif (IE R), Dr. Maniruzzaman (Geography), K M Saaduddin (Sociology), AMM Shahidullah (Math), Dr. Sirajul Islam (Islamic History), Dr. Akhtar Ahmed (Education), Zahirul Huq (Psychology), Ahsanul Huq (English), Serajul Islam Chowdbury (English), and Kabir Chowdhury (English). Another page of his diary recorded the names of 16 collaborating teachers of Dhaka university. Apart from that there were also names of Chowdbury Moinuddin, the chief of operation for elimination of the intelligentsia, and Shawkat Imran, a member of the central Al-Badr command, and the head of Dhaka Al-Badr forces. The diary also contained names and addresses of several other prominent Bengalis. All of them lost their lives at the hands of Al-Badr forces. On a small piece of paper the name of the member finance of the Pakistan Jute Board, Abdul Khalek, was written down. On December 9, 1971, the Al-Badr forces kidnapped Mr. Khalek from his office. They demanded Taka 10,000 as ransom. They saw Mrs. Khalek for ransom money. But at that time she was unable to pay the kidnappers more than 450 taka. She promised that she would give them the rest of the money later, and begged them her husband's life. But Mr. Khalek never came back. Ashrafuzzaman has also been implicated in the murder of some journalists. It was Ashrafuzzaman who kidnapped the shift-in- charge of the Purbadesh, and the literary editor, Mr. Golam Mustafa.  War crimes trial =Arrest warrant= On April 25, 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal submitted formal charges against Ashrafuz Zaman Khan on the charge of killing 18 intellectuals towards the end of the Bangladesh liberation war 1971, as the \\"chief executor\\" of the Al-Badr force.

One derivation given is that the McKinley are of the ancient Ulaid race and are a branch of its \\"Red Branch\\" MacDunleavy (dynasty) royal house of the Dal Fiatach which dominated the kingship of the over-kingdom of Ulaid (original Gaelic language Mac Duinnshléibhe). Etymology for the origins of the surname proposes that the Anglicized surname McKinley, like the surname MacNulty (Gaelic Mac an Ultaigh, trans. \\"son of the ultonian, ulidian or ulsterman\\"), arose originally from a Gaelic nickname given the deposed MacDunleavy dynasty royals while exiled in Tirconnell and elsewhere. Being, also, one of Ireland's ancient hereditary medical families, the MacDunleavy (variant English spelling MacDonlevy) were in Tirconnell accorded the high Gaelic status of \\"ollahm leighis\\" or the official physicians to the O'Donnell clan in County Donegal and practiced as physicians while exiled in Argyll, Scotland.Edward MacLysaght, The Surnames of Ireland, 5th Edition, Irish Academic Press, Dublin, 1980, pp. 238, 292, citing to 2 entries in The Annals of the Four Masters, which is a historical chronicle that records, among other matter, the births and deaths of Gaelic nobility. The first entry cited is an entry recording the 1395 A.D. death of a Maurice, the son of one “Paul Utach”, who is, himself, recorded there to be “Chief Physician of Tyrconnell” and also as “Paul the Ulidian”. It is there in the Annals further stated by its authors of the father Paul Ultach that “This is the present usual Irish name of the Mac Donlevy, who were originally chiefs of Ulaid. The branch of the family who became physicians to O’Donnell are still extant (at time of compilation of the Annals in the 17th century just after the fall of the last Gaelic sovereignty of Tyrconnell in 1607), near Kilmacrenan, in the county of Donegal.” The second citation is to an entry recording the 1586 A.D. death of \\"Owen Utach\\", who is therein noted to be a particularly distinguished and skilled physician. The Annals compilers further elaborate of Owen Ultach at this entry that “His real name was Donlevy or, Mac Donlevy. He was physician to O’Donnell.” The nickname was Mac an Leigh. Per this scenario the Gaelic language patronymic forming prefix \\"Mac\\" (meaning \\"descended of\\")Adolph, Anthony Collins Tracing Your Irish Family History (2010) Harper Collins, Part 4 “Tracing ancient Irish roots”, p. 232, noting that the Mac prefix element of a Gaelic patronymic surname or clan name is not actually the Gaelic word Mac, meaning in English son, but, is a shortened form of the original pre 11th century Gaelic prefix “mac meic” meaning “the son of the son of … etc.”Also, The World Book Dictionary, in 2 volumes, Volume 2 (L-Z), Chicago, World Book, Inc., © 2005, (set), (set), p. 1528 “patronymic … a name derived from name of paternal ancestor, especially by addition of a prefix … (usage example) MacDonald meaning ‘descendant of Donald’ …”The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, in 2 volumes, Oxford, Oxford University Press, © 1971, 26th printing July, 1987, Vol. 1 (A-O), p. 1960, noting the “Mac” and “O” element of a Gaelic language patronymic normally functions as a dynastic claim, “O, O’ … The Irish word ō, ua, OIr. au, ‘descendant’, used as a prefix of Irish patronymic surnames … a member of an ancient Irish family. … P. Gillmore Hunter’s Arcadia, An Irishman who claims his direct descent from Finn McCoul or some king whose name begins with an ‘O’ or ‘Mc’. ” The prefixes, however, are as in this etymology for McKinley, in fact though rarely, attached to, themselves, rare Gaelic language nickname surnames. See Anthony Adolf Collins Tracing Your Irish History Harper Collins (2010), pp. 230–233, also, noting additionally, though, that the normal function of these alternative prefixes is to claim lineage to a royal house. is joined to the Gaelic language \\"Léigh\\" meaning leech, but denoting a physician.Susan Wilkinson, “Early Medical Education in Ireland”, Irish Migration Studies in Latin America, Vol. 6, No. 3 (November 2008), p. 157, Origin of the Surname, McNulty, and its Association with the McDonlevys/Dunleavys of County Down, section “Dunleavy Variants: Dunlops, Leavys, Levingstones and McKinlays”, also, noting William McKinley, the 25th president of the United States, was of Antrim (n) stock, noting that the McKinley were actually in association with the McNulty in exile in Tirconnell, noting that like McNulty, McKinley was also an agnomen of the Donlevy physicians of Tirconnell, and noting, finally, at section “Migration of the Duleavys from County Down” a significant early presence of the McKinley name in Tirconnell Leeching having been for millennia, in Gaelic Ireland and elsewhere, a commonly employed medical practice.Rev. Patrick Woulfe, Priest of the Diocese of Limerick, Member of the Council, National Academy of Ireland, Irish Names and Surnames, © 1967 Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, in Irish and English, pp. 355–356, The surname McKinley is here said to actually be synonymous with the surname McNulty.

It was a first-class-only Trans Europ Express (TEE) operated by the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer français (SNCF). The train was named after Jean Baptiste Kléber, a Strasbourg-born French general during the French Revolutionary Wars. Route The Kléber's route was the long Paris–Strasbourg railway, with just the following stops: * Strasbourg-Ville – Nancy-Ville – Paris-Est History The Kléber was introduced on 23 May 1971. Initially, it departed from Strasbourg as TEE 60 at 07:50 and arrived in Paris at 11:40. The return train, TEE 61, left Paris at 17:20 and reached Strasbourg at 21:10. Between the Winter 1973/74 timetable and its 1980/81 counterpart, the train ran 15 minutes later in each direction. On 26 September 1982, the morning TEE 60 service was discontinued. Its name was transferred to the evening TEE 62 Strasbourg–Paris service, which had previously been the TEE Stanislas. The latter became the Rapide Stanislas, keeping its same late morning departure time from Paris and taking over Kléber morning schedule from Strasbourg. The TEE 62, now renamed Kléber (ex-TEE Stanislas), continued to leave Strasbourg at 17:10 and arrive in Paris at 21:00. The TEE 62 / TEE 61 ceased to exist as separate trains on 23 September 1988, when they were integrated into an international train between Paris and Stuttgart Hbf in Stuttgart, Germany. Formation (consist) The Kléber was hauled by the SNCF Class BB 15000, a class of 25 kV 50 Hz AC electric locomotives. Its inaugural formation of rolling stock was a rake of SNCF painted in a distinctive red, orange, light grey and slate grey livery. Originally, the coaches were arranged as an A4Dtux, two A6u, three A8tu, an Vru and an A3rtu. On 28 September 1975, the train was lengthened to a total of 13 coaches. Due to the limited availability of the Grand Confort coaches, they were occasionally replaced by Mistral 56-type . In 1982, the train's formation was changed to Mistral 69-type DEV Inoxes. Throughout the Kléber's existence, its restaurant car was staffed by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL).

Coagulometer is the medical laboratory analyzer used for testing of the hemostasis system. Modern coagulometers realize different methods of activation and observation of development of blood clots in blood or in blood plasma. Classification of blood clotting tests Substantially all coagulometers used in laboratory diagnostics are based on the methods of testing of the hemostasis system created more than fifty years ago. The majority of these methods are good to detect defects in one of the hemostasis components, without diagnosing other possible defects. Another problem of the actual hemostasis system diagnostics is the thrombosis prediction, i.e. sensitivity to the patient's prethrombotic state.All the diversity of clinical tests of the blood coagulation system can be divided into 2 groups: global (integral, general) tests, and «local» (specific) tests. =Global tests= Global tests characterize the results of work of the whole clotting cascade. They suit to diagnose the general state of the blood coagulation system and the intensity of pathologies, and to simultaneously record all attendant influences. Global methods play the key role at the first stage of diagnostics: they provide an integral picture of alterations within the coagulation system and allow predicting a tendency to hyper- or hypo- coagulation in general. =Local tests= Local tests characterize the results of work of the separate components of the blood coagulation system cascade, as well as of the separate coagulation factors. They are essential for the possibility to specify the pathology localization within the accuracy of coagulation factor. A D-dimer (product of thrombi degradation) test can be specified separately. The rise of D-dimers concentration in the patient's blood states the possibility of the completed thrombosis. To obtain a complete picture of the work of hemostasis by a patient, the doctor should have a possibility to choose which test is necessary. According to the type of the investigated object, the following complementary groups of methods can be specified: * Tests in platelet poor plasma or in platelet free plasma (convenient for transportation; can be frozen; possibility to use optical observation methods; but the thrombocyte component of the hemostasis is not taken into account), * Tests in platelet rich plasma (close to real conditions in the body, but restrictions as to the terms of work), * Tests in whole blood (the most adjusted to human physiology; the test can be started immediately; but the least convenient due to terms of blood storage and difficulties of the results' interpretation). =Specific global tests= * Thromboelastography ** investigation of the whole blood ** no information about the thrombin formation kinetics, low separability of plasma and thrombocyte hemostasis contribution ** non-standardized ** low sensitivity * Thrombin generation test (thrombin potential, endogenous thrombin potential) ** possibility to use platelet poor plasma or platelet rich plasma ** information about the catalyst of the main reaction – transformation of fibrinogen into fibrin ** homogenous (activation in the whole sample volume) * Thrombodynamics test ** non- homogenous: realization of the three-dimensional model of the clot growth ** use of platelet free plasma ** record of information about the clot formation as a diagram, giving the possibility to calculate the key parameters of the blood coagulation system ** new test, not widely accepted =Specific local tests= * APTT ** characteristics of the velocity of passage of the intrinsic coagulation pathway ** poor plasma (the most convenient to work with, but no realization of the thrombocyte clotting mechanism) ** contact activation pathway * Prothrombin time test (or prothrombin test, INR, PT) – velocity of passage of the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway ** poor plasma ** not sensitive to deficiency of intrinsic coagulation pathway factors * Highly specialized methods to reveal the alteration in concentration of separate factors.

Background The village of Ewenny is sited above all of the natural resources to make the local red earthenware pottery: clay deposited from the ice age; wood and coal for firing; glaze materials; and stone to build the kilns. Since 1427, there have been fifteen potteries in the Ewenny area at one time or another, all small family concerns. Foundation The Ewenny Pottery was founded in 1610, probably by farmers in the area looking to make commercial use of the clay. In the early 1800s Evan Jenkins married Mary, the daughter of then owner John Morgan, and so started the Jenkins family period of ownership that continues to this present day. The products at this time would have been mainly for agricultural and local use, plus occasional commissions. At this time, the number of potteries in the area was at its height, but quickly dwindled due to the onset of cheap enamelware and china imports from the Far East. =Horace W Elliot= In 1883 at the height of the Arts and Crafts movement, Bayswater, London based designer and ceramics dealer Horace W Elliot was visiting country potteries looking for pieces to sell in his showrooms. Having struck up a friendship with the Jenkins brothers, he is particularly associated with Ewenny, but also with C.H. Brannam and Bourne Denby. Elliott made annual visits to Eweny until 1913, designing many pieces for the Jenkins brothers to make. His fleur-de-lys design mark was often applied to Ewenny and other wares, and as a proponent of the Esperanto movement, sometimes inscribed his pots in that language. =David John Jenkins= In the early 1900s, David John Jenkins was born into the family business. After working with his father in the pottery and uncles at the claypits, he married Martha Arthur whose family had owned the Corntown Pottery, with whom he had seven children. After buying the Ewenny Pottery from his cousin Edwin II, he invented the classical mottled-glazing technique that is still used by the pottery today. The piece is firstly dipped completely in one glaze, and then splashed with a second glaze. David John Jenkins created the technique as he had noticed that thanks to the railways, there were many more visitors travelling into the countryside looking for a unique and original memento of their excursion. At the outbreak of World War II, all of his sons were called-up, and he could only fire the kiln when given permission by the Air Raid Warden. He was however regularly commissioned by ROF Bridgend to make one-off and commemorative pieces, with his son Dai given leave of absents on one occasion from the Royal Air Force to help his father fire the kilns. =Post WW2= Post the war, and only Dai and Arthur returned to the business. With growth in the business, the partnership could no longer afford to dig its own clay, and so it consolidated to just being a pottery. After the death of David John Jenkins in 1961, the two brothers became co-owners. However, with mass-produced pottery now cheap, the business was in decline. In 1969, Arthur's eldest son Alun had graduated with a degree in Ceramics from Cardiff College of Art. Wishing to see the business continue, Alun and his wife Jayne started producing pieces in their garage, and then gained a large commission to produce commemorative mugs for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 1977. Present Alun and Jayne Jenkins (7th generation) continue to produce pieces, together with their daughter Caitlin Jenkins (8th generation) who has a degree in ceramics from the University of Wales Institute Cardiff and a master's degree from the Royal College of Art. The present pottery and showrooms are situated on the site of a former kiln, on the main road through the village of Ewenny.

Population: History The settlement was founded in 1858 and served the railway station of Preobrazhenskaya. The name is related to the Preobrazhensky Regiment which was stationed nearby. An early enterprise in the settlement was a sawmill. By the end of the 19th century, the settlement was also a popular summer house area. At the time, it belonged to Luzhsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate (subsequently Petrograd Governorate and Leningrad Governorate). In 1919, the station and the settlement were renamed Tolmachyovo to commemorate Nikolay Tolmachyov, a bolshevik killed in the area during the Russian Civil War. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Luzhsky District, with the administrative center in the town of Luga, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On November 9, 1938 Tolmachyovo, which previously had the status of suburban settlement, was granted urban settlement status. Between 1941 and 1944, during World War II, Tolmachyovo was occupied by German troops. Economy=Industry= In Tolmachyovo, there is a plant of concrete constructions and another one producing compound feed. =Transportation= Tolmachyovo is located on the railway connecting Saint Petersburg and Pskov. There are two railway stations in the settlement, Tolmachyovo and Partizanskaya. The M20 highway, connecting Saint Petersburg with Pskov and eventually with Kyiv, runs several kilometers east of Tolmachyovo. The settlement has an access to it. Tolmachyovo is also connected by road with Slantsy and Kingisepp. Culture and recreation Tolmachyovo contains four objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. One is the remains of the Lidino Estate, and the other three are monuments to soldiers fallen during World War II.

Introduced in 1971, it was operated by the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer français (SNCF). The train was named after Stanisław I Leszczyński (French: Stanislas Leszczynski), King of Poland, Duke of Lorraine and a count of the Holy Roman Empire. It was a first-class-only Trans Europ Express (TEE) until 1982, and then a two-class Rapide until its discontinuance in about 1988. Route The Stanislas's route was the long Paris–Strasbourg railway, with just the following stops: * Paris-Est – Nancy-Ville – Strasbourg-Ville History The Stanislas was introduced on 26 September 1971, to complement an existing TEE service, the Kléber, which, since 23 May 1971, had run from Strasbourg to Paris in the morning and had returned to Strasbourg in the evening. Initially, the Stanislas departed from Paris as TEE 63 at 11:05 (later 11:00) and arrived in Strasbourg at 14:50. The return Stanislas, TEE 62, left Strasbourg at 17:10 and reached Paris at 21:00. On 26 September 1982, both the morning TEE trains between Paris and Strasbourg were discontinued. The evening TEE 62 service was renamed Kléber, so that the remaining TEE service on the route – one run per day in each direction – would both carry the same name. The Stanislas became a two-class Rapide, eastbound keeping the same schedule as before, departing from Paris at 11:00 (and still train number 63), and westbound taking over what had been the TEE Kleber schedule, from Strasbourg around 7:45 (still train number 60).Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (May 29–June 30, 1983 edition), pp. 161–162. Peterborough, UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. In autumn 1984, the westbound trip's schededule was moved about one hour earlier, from 7:47 to 6:59 (later 6:52), and otherwise the schedule and classification of Stanislas remained unchanged until at least summer 1988,Thomas Cook European Timetable (April 1988 edition), pp. 168–169, 515. Thomas Cook Publishing. but the train was discontinued by at least 1991—and possibly as early as September 1988. Formation (consist) The Stanislas was hauled by the SNCF Class BB 15000, a class of 25 kV 50 Hz AC electric locomotives. Its inaugural formation of rolling stock was a rake of SNCF painted in a distinctive red, orange, light grey and slate grey livery. Originally, the coaches were arranged as an A4Dtux, two A8u, two A8tu, two Vru and three ex-Mistral A8u. On 29 September 1974, the train was lengthened to a total of 12 coaches. The following year, on 26 September 1975, a further coach was added to the formation. Throughout the Stanislas's existence, its restaurant car was staffed by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL).

Population: History The settlement was specifically established to house miners working in the nearby goldmines. In 1961, geologists working in the Pilkhinkuul river valley found a large gold deposit. On March 26, 1963 decree number 104 of the Northeastern Economic Council announced an official decision on the creation of a mine to be named \\"Polyarny\\" and a camp of the same name. The first convoy of 15 tractors brought equipment, building materials and everything needed to create the mine and the village. Despite the difficult conditions construction was rapid. The settlement was constructed in three locations: in the centre two-storeyed well-appointed homes and general social infrastructure were built. On the southern outskirts of the settlement, a more private sector was constructed, which became commonly known as \\"Shanghai\\" (). This was also the site of a number of wooden houses with few amenities. Finally, in the northern part of the settlement production units were constructed along with a small residential area, which became known as \\"Bichgrad\\" (), mostly consisting of single-story barracks. Because of its relative remoteness from the main part of the settlement a bus route was organised to the high school in 1975. In the north-eastern part of the village was a base of geologists with the residential area, which was known colloquially as \\"Exploration\\" (). At the end of the 1980s additional construction of residential buildings began, where people began to move from deplorable housing, where they had been living without repair since the foundation of the settlement. In accordance with the direction of the prevailing wind almost all the houses were oriented from east to west when they were constructed, and because of the permafrost layer, strong foundations were laid and no construction was undertaken higher than two storeys. When mining became unprofitable, a law was passed in May 1995, abolishing the settlement; it was abolished in 1995.Постановление Правительства РФ от 24 мая 1995 г.

Robert Ramsay also published some engravings by John Raphael Smith. While still a youth, James Ramsay was painting professionally in the family business, and exhibited at age 17. Ramsay died, after a protracted illness, at 40 Blackett Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on 23 June 1854, aged 68. Exhibitions Ramsay's name first appeared in the catalogue of the Royal Academy exhibition for 1803, when he sent a self- portrait. Three years later he exhibited a portrait of Henry Grattan, and in 1810 one of John Towneley. In 1811 his contributions included portraits of the Earl of Moira and Lord Cochrane, and in 1813 that of Lord Brougham, whom he again painted in 1818. In 1814 Ramsay sent to the academy two scriptural subjects, Peter denying Christ and Peter's Repentance, and in 1819 views of Tynemouth Abbey and of North and South Shields, but his works were mainly portraits. There are at least three by him of Thomas Bewick; the earliest, exhibited in 1816, and engraved by John Burnet, went to the Hancock Museum of the Newcastle Natural History Society; another, which appeared at the Royal Academy in 1823, to the National Portrait Gallery; and a third, a small full- length engraved by Frederick Bacon, belonged to Robert Stirling Newall of Gateshead. A portrait by him of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, painted for the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and later in Newcastle town hall, was exhibited in 1837, together with that of Dr Thomas Elliotson, which went to the Royal College of Physicians. His portrait of Henry Grattan, which was passed down in the Grattan family, was engraved in mezzotint by Charles Turner, and a copy of it by Sir Thomas Alfred Jones went to the National Gallery of Ireland. Ramsay also exhibited scriptural, historical, and fancy subjects at the British Institution, including Isaac blessing Jacob, in 1813, The Trial of King Charles the First, in 1829, and The Entry of the Black Prince into London, in 1841; and also a few portraits at the Society of British Artists. About 1847 Ramsay left London for Newcastle- upon-Tyne, but he continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy, where he had another portrait of himself in 1849.

He was the youngest child of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, an early colonial administrator who served as Roko Tui Ra and later as Roko Tui Tailevu. Dovi's mother, Adi Litiana Maopa hailed from the chiefly Vuanirewa clan of Lakeba;Henry Soszynski, World of Royalty Website, 1996–2012, Tui Nayau page, http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/states/fiji/nayau.html she was the eldest child of Roko Tevita Vakacere Uluilakeba Tui Nayau, suzerain of the Lau province. Her mother, also of the Tui Kaba was Adi Asenaca Kakua the eldest daughter of Ratu Seru Cakobau the Vunivalu of Bau who ceded the islands to the United Kingdom in 1874. Dovi's eldest brother Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna was an elder statesman and held the paramount title of Tui Lau. Ratu Sukuna was the first Fijian to obtain a university qualification. He read law at Oxford, attained an LLB and was admitted as a Barrister (Middle Temple) in the High Court of England. He served in the Legislative Council as a member and later as Speaker. He is best remembered for his work as Secretary for Native Affairs (Talai-ni-Kovana) and Chairmanship of the Native Lands Commission; his accomplishments include the passing of the Native Lands Ordinance and establishment of the Native Land Trust Board. His eldest sister Adi Kacaraini Loaloakubou, was the mother of former Lord Mayor of Suva Ratu Meli Vakarewakobau. His next eldest sister Adi Asenaca Teimumu Kuini Vuikaba was the first Fijian to graduate as a fully qualified nurse. She married the Tui Noikoro a high chief of the Navosa district of Nadroga province. Her granddaughter and namesake Adi Kuini Vuikaba Speed was briefly Deputy Prime Minister in the People's Coalition Government of Mahendra Chaudry. His other older siblings were Ratu Tiale Wimbeldon Thomas Vuiyasawa and Adi Salote Mokoiwaqa. After Dovi was conceived, the Roko Tui Bau at the time, approached his parents with an unusual request. He presented a tabua or sperm whale's tooth as was customary with traditional ceremonies of Fiji and asked that the unborn child become heir to his title upon his death. Presumably Dovi's older siblings would be in the line of succession for the superior title of Vunivalu of Bau. The old chief's request was granted and so when he completed his education and returned to Fiji, he was installed by the Vusaratu chiefs (Roko Tui Viwa, Roko Tui Kiuva, Roko Tui Cautata) in a ceremony witnessed by Ratu Popi Seniloli (at the time Vunivalu of Bau), Roko Tui Namata, Roko Tui Veikau in a simple yaqona ceremony in the Vatanitawake. Dovi, as most chiefs, had a dynastic marriage partner chosen for him by his elders. He spurned that choice and married Adi Losalini Raravuya Uluiviti, a lady of rank from Nairai, in Fiji's Lomaiviti province. She was one of the first women to become a member of Fiji's Legislative Council and subsequently a Member of Parliament. They had four children: Ratu Joni Maenabua Tuimacilai Madraiwiwi, Ratu Timoci Taniela Taliai Tavanavanua, Adi Litiana Maopa, Adi Viviana Valotu Sofi Veisaca. Dovi's eldest child, however, was a daughter, Adi Monika Tuikilakila whose mother was a lady of rank from the island of Kadavu. His eldest son succeeded him as Roko Tui Bau (title) and is a former Vice-President of Fiji, prominent lawyer and former High Court Judge. Education and career Like all his older siblings, he was educated by an English tutor engaged by his father at home. At the time this was the residence of the provincial administrator or Roko Tui in the province of Ra. When the tutor indicated he was ready, he was sent off to boarding school at the Wanganui Boys' College in New Zealand. After attaining university entrance, he attended Otago University and studied medicine. After completing matriculation, he became the first fully qualified Fijian medical doctor, much as his brother was first university graduate/lawyer and his sister was the first nurse. Their father was the first Fijian provincial administrator or Roko Tui and had to struggle to educate himself and had always stressed to his children the importance and value of a western education.

It was founded as Reputation Changer in 2009. In 2013 it purchased the Brand.com domain name for $500,000, and changed its name. The company provided Internet search management, creating positive web articles about its clients in order to have them overtake negative news, and Wikipedia profile management. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and was shut down. Reputation Changer The company was founded in September 2009 as Reputation Changer, with its headquarters in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The company began as an online reputation management company offering services to small businesses and individuals. To help improve online reputations, Reputation Changer created its own positive content about its clients, in an attempt to force other less flattering articles about them down in Google search results and thus cause criticisms to \\"disappear\\". Though during this time the company had been accused of \\"making false claims\\" about the effectiveness of their services, the company insisted that those claims were the result of rivals and not legitimate complaints. This includes the hiding of negative user-generated reviews for hotels and other commercial enterprises. In November 2012, Michael Zammuto joined the company as President. This led to some restructuring within the company including the June 2013 renaming of the company from Reputation Changer to Brand.com. The re-branding including the acquisition of the Internet domain brand.com for $500,000. The company also moved its headquarters from West Chester to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company had 135 employees, and worked with both small and large clients. Seattle City Light hired Brand.com to remove a 2008 Seattle Weekly story critical of their CEO, Jorge Carrasco. Brand.com created several blog posts \\"to drown out critical stories\\" including one at Huffington Post where the writer did not disclose conflict of interest, subsequently leading to the article being removed. Ars Technica reported that some of the websites that the stories were posted on \\"appear to have been utterly fake\\". In May 2014, Seattle City Light requested a refund from Brand.com as they claimed the company did not deliver the services that were promised as the critical story still appeared high in Google searches. In September 2014 it was revealed that Brand.com had received a penalty from Google for potentially trying to game the system in increasing its own company's Google rankings. Brand.com contacted online websites directly to ask the removal of links to Brand.com.Why reputation manager Brand.com had to manage its own Services Brand.com offered brand management and reputation management services. They reviewed the online presence of individuals and companies and provide action plans said to help control how information appears in search engines. Services also included suppression of negative reviews on sites like Yelp or Google Reviews. Part of these services was the planned launch of Brand.com's \\"Google Eraser\\", which claimed to expunge negative listings from a Google search. At the time some stated that the process was unproven, and that Brand.com had not been transparent about its process, claiming that their processes were proprietary. In 2013, Brand.com stated further that they would enact a De-Indexing Action Plan to permanently erase false or libelous information from major search engines as opposed to attempting to move the negative information further down in search results. The process involved verifying that the information was false, and then working with Google, Yahoo, and Bing to de-index the information. The company created the Command Center platform, through which clients could monitor the results of its advertising or reputation management efforts. Brand.com edited Wikipedia on behalf of clients. The company claimed on its website to have \\"built an entire practice around creating, managing, and monitoring Wikipedia.\\" and offered to create a \\"positive Wikipedia page\\". Michael Zammuto told Quartz in 2013 that the company \\"helps ensure that information on Wikipedia is accurate, not false or defamatory.\\" Brand.com also charged clients to have journalists write news stories under their direction, instead of having journalists independently select their own stories from news releases, and claims that these news stories have appeared in news publications including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, The Huffington Post, and Forbes Magazine.

She was the only child of upwardly mobile parents; her mother was a social worker and an assistant director of the Bureau for Colored Children (later the Bureau for Child Care); her father Lemuel Cowdery was a caterer and United States postal worker. Cowdery discovered her talent for poetry as a child. She graduated from the prestigious Philadelphia High School for Girls and attended Pratt Institute in New York to study fashion design but did not graduate. While attending Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, she frequented night places in Greenwich Village. While still in high school, Cowdery published three poems in 1927 in Black Opals, a new literary journal founded that year. It was co-founded in 1927 by Arthur Fauset, a folklorist and teacher, and Nellie Rathbone Bright, a teacher and poet who later published four novels. They were part of a literary and intellectual group in Philadelphia who also became known as the Black Opals. Cowdery's poem in the first issue, as well as one of Bright's, were among pieces to win praise by Countee Cullen, the new literary editor of Opportunity, a larger journal based in Harlem, New York. Groups such as the Black Opals were being founded in other East Coast cities, such as Washington, DC and Boston.

Terry was born on 24 September 1936 in East Ardsley, West Yorkshire, where he spent his formative years and died on 6 December 2013 in the town of Alora, Andalucia, Spain. Mostly self- taught, he studied and was greatly inspired by the works of Paul Klee and a wide range of other European artists such as Picasso, Gauguin, and Matisse. He attended the Leeds College of Art before pursuing painting as his profession. Early years In 1960 at the age of 24, Terry moved to St Mary, Isles of Scilly where he and his wife worked in the Atlantic Hotel for two years. Here, Terry found inspiration in the rugged island landscape and the often sunny and temperate climate of the Islands produced the perfect conditions for his painting. It was while working on the island and through his group of friends there that Terry heard of the growing art scene in London. After a short return to Yorkshire Terry moved with his family to Beckenham in Kent in 1964. The 1960s and 1970s While living in Beckenham, Terry got to know Nicholas Treadwell and was one of the regular artists with work on \\"Nicholas Treadwell's Mobile Art Gallery\\", based nearby in Croydon. Terry was one of the first artists to show at the Nicholas Treadwell Gallery on Chiltern Street in London when it opened in 1968. Terry's early London exhibitions were widely covered in the local press and they brought Terry into the media spotlight and the attention of some of the celebreties of the era including Bill Wyman, Muriel Spark, Lulu and Andrew Bown now of Status Quo. In the early 1970s, Terry moved back to his roots in Yorkshire where he continued to work while holding exhibitions in London. He struck up a friendship with Stuart Walton, a local artist specialising in northern street scenes, and also with Austin Mitchell who was at that time the presenter of the Yorkshire TV news programme Callendar. One of his paintings appeared on and was analysed by his friend, the late biologist and science historian Jacob Bronowski, in an episode of the acclaimed 1974 television series 'The Ascent of Man' and the accompanying book. \\"The first question we ask is, is the human brain a better computer - a more complex computer? Of course, artists in particular tend to think of the brain as a computer. So in his \\"Portrait or Dr Bronowski\\" Terry Durham has symbols of the spectrum and the computer, because that is how an artist imagines a scientist's brain. But of course that cannot be right. If the brain were a computer, then it would be carrying out a pre-wired set of actions in an inflexible sequence.\\" \\"The Ascent of Man\\" By Jacob Bronowski Copyright © Estate of Jacob Bronowski, First published in hardback by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1973,First paperback edition published in 1976. In the mid 1970s Terry produced his first of a series of children's art books this one based on a character of his own creation Angus the Pangus. This was a black on white line drawing work produced and printed in limited edition by Robin Alston at the Janus Press in Ilkely and reflected Terry's passion for encouraging children to read and draw. 1980s to 2000 In 1993, Terry moved with his family to the Algarve, southern Portugal, where he lived for 11 years. During his time there, in addition to painting professionally, he had many successful exhibitions, was employed regularly as a mural painter and, going back to his musical roots of the 1960-70s, performed as vocalist for a rock and blues band. He was particularly inspired by the people, climate, colours, landscape and architecture of southern Portugal. During this time, Terry also had several international exhibitions, including five in Berlin and one on the island of Jersey. One of his 'Yellow Bird Walking' series is on show in Rickenbakers Music Inn in Berlin and while there Terry had the great pleasure to meet one of his jazz heroes Coco Schumann who expressed a great appreciation and fondness for his work. In 2003, Terry moved to Porto Seguro in the Bahia municipality of north-east Brazil where the vibrant colours, wildlife and tribal cultures played a significant part in the numerous paintings and sketches he would complete during his time there and in the future. As well as spending his time painting and travelling, he was commissioned by the proprietors of a Portuguese and Jamaican themed beach restaurant and music venue, That Shack, to bring the venue to life through murals painted in his own unique style. Music and poetry Music and poetry were also important to Terry's creative nature and he formed a group called Storyteller with Roger Moon, Mike Rogers and the late Caroline Attard. Storyteller toured the local jazz and folk clubs and were signed by Transatlantic Records recording two albums 'Storyteller', produced by Peter Frampton and 'More Pages'. The group appeared on the same bill with The Humblebums (Gerry Rafferty and Billy Connolly), Hawkwind, and Vinegar Joe (Elkie Brooks and Robert Palmer) during their time. The group's highlight came when they were support act for a UK tour by Ralph McTell, beginning at the Royal Festival Hall, London. Shortly after this they split up. Terry went on to record his only solo album Crystal Telephone, with musical arrangements by John Coleman and featuring the saxophonist Evan Parker,which has recently been re-released and a track played on the Stuart Maconie Radio 6 Music Show Freakier Zone on 15/09/12. His solo work Crystal Telephone has been described as \\"a wonderfully different album\\", \\"Yorkshire's answer to Serge Gainsbourg\\" and \\"a beautiful piece of poetry and music - a very unique balsam for the soul\\". More recently Durham resided in Alora, a town in the province of Malaga, Andalucia, Spain, where he lived and worked from 2007 until his death on 6 December 2013. He had major individual and combined exhibitions in both Alora and Malaga and participated in regional art competitions. When not painting professionally he taught art classes for children and adults. His work was displayed in various establishments in Alora as murals and caricatures, and he was widely and fondly known in the area as 'el artista' (the artist) or 'el maestro' (the teacher). Terry had his own Facebook page and official website where his latest works can still be viewed and purchased as fine art prints on paper and in floater frames.

A Shariah advisor can be an independent individual, a group of individuals, or an institution with adequate human and technical resources to advise on legal and Shariah matters in the context of financial product structuring. An example of an individual Shariah advisor is Sheikh Nizam Yaqubi, a Bahraini national, who advises scores of institutions around the globe. Individual Shariah advisors are of two types: (1) those trained in the classical Islamic legal tradition; and (2) those with contemporary educational background but impressive expertise in structuring of Islamic financial products. The former is best represented by the likes of Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani, a Pakistani cleric, who is chairman of the Shari'a Advisory Board of Accounting and Auditing Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI). The latter is best represented by the likes of Dr Humayon Dar, who is an Islamic economist,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/12/islamicfinance.islam with widely respected expertise in structuring innovative Islamic financial products. In a number of jurisdictions, it is a regulatory requirement for Islamic financial institutions to appoint a Shariah advisor (with Pakistan, for example, requiring at least one individual to serve as a Shariah advisor for Islamic banks operating in the country; and Malaysia requiring Islamic banks to appoint a Shariah advisory committee comprising at least five individuals). In case of non-banking institutions and transactions, the requirements of Shariah advisory vary. In Malaysia, for example it is sufficient to appoint a Shariah advisory firm (an independent institution) to seek advice on Islamic capital market transactions. In Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the requirement is to appoint a Shariah advisory committee comprising at least three individuals.

It was invented by the military cartographers, who worked for the Austrian-Ottoman Border Commission, set up by peace treaties from 1699 (Treaty of Karlowitz) and 1718 (Treaty of Požarevac), and consisted of number of Austrians, Venetians and one Croat (Vitezović). It was used more consistently since that time in maps produced for the part of the territory in present day Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically region of Bosanska Krajina (Krajina = ; during Medieval Bosnia known as Donji Kraji () and Zapadne Strane ()). This territory was usually depicted as roughly comprising the land area between the river Vrbas in the east, the Sava in the northeast, the Una in the northwest, as well as Dinara mountain in the south, including the Cazinska krajina pocket in the far west. Parts of Lika, Banovina and northern Dalmatia (now in Croatia) were also mapped as part of \\"Turkish Croatia\\" when Ottoman borders went further west. History In Austro-Hungarian military maps from the 16th to 19th century, the so-called \\"Turkish Croatia\\" appeared as a borderland in the Croatian Military Frontier, whose Habsburg Monarchy-controlled side, in present-day Croatia, was administered directly from Vienna's military headquarters. In the 19th century, following the conclusion of the Ottoman–Habsburg wars, and the transfer of power in the Bosnia Vilayet from Ottomans to Austrian rule at the Berlin Congress in 1878, the term became redundant, as it no longer served its purpose, and disappeared from official usage completely. The entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina came under a direct rule of the Viennese government, and since 1908 annexation became a new Crown land, thus making a term irrelevant in the eyes of its originators. Within the lands of the Habsburg empire, the medieval Croatian kingdom lost eastern territories known as \\"Turkish Croatia\\" which at the end of 16th century fell to the Ottomans and become part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1878 when Bosnia and Herzegovina appeared as political entity large area of Turkish Croatia become part of that entity.Mladen Ančić; (2004) Society, Ethnicity, and Politics in Bosnia- Herzegovina p. 339; Časopis za suvremenu povijest Vol. 36 No. 1, Zagreb, The term started appearing in colloquial usage among some Austria-Hungarian military and political mapmakers, in correlation to Ottoman retreat and Austria-Hungarian expansion, and subsequently it was produced in military and geostrategic maps. From here it found its way into narrative, peculiar to Croatian national revival movement, based on a paraphrase of so-called hrvatske \\"matere zemlje\\" () and \\"hrvatsko državno pravo\\" () (similar to one in Serbia with an expression \\"Srpske zemlje\\" ()), which is at the time propagated by political organization called Party of Rights. It was typically exploited for the geopolitical purpose and utterance of territorial ambitions and expansionist aspirations of both Austria-Hungary and later Croatia, via transposition of these \\"rights\\" on Bosnia and Herzegovina and its historic territory. Although on rare occasions, the term was also used in romanticized historiography, as well as in the phantasmagoric politics of \\"National awakening\\" and \\"National integration and homogenization\\" of the Croatia of the late 19th to early 20th century. In the first half of 20th century with a rise of nationalist fervor, up to the time and establishment of fascist NDH in 1940s, this term appeared sporadically again, concerning the resurrection of a Croatian statehood, within the romantic sloganeering of Nedeljko Mihanović, journalistic and political propagandistic fieldwork in regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina future by Frano Milobar and geopolitical contemplation by Ivo Pilar and Filip Lukas, eventually getting politically operationalized by Ante Starčević, and in 1940s, implemented by Frank and Ante Pavelić via occupation and incorporation of entire Bosnia and Herzegovina into Nazi puppet-state, NDH. In more recent times, with a rise of Franjo Tuđman and establishment of the Republic of Croatia in the 1990s, the term was revived and was preferred Tuđman's and his close associates' argument in reference to their political and military aims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which culminated in Croat-Bosniak war. Encouraged with Tuđman's usage of the term as a mean to denigrate and devalue Bosnia and Herzegovina sovereignty and statehood, the term was adopted as part of Croatian far-right nationalist narrative and, although sparsely, as part of their official political discourse, however with little if any impact on mainstream international geopolitics, political geography and historiography, or on academic research for that matter. The term never took hold outside the scope of Croatian political extremism and academic fringes.

(born 29 April 1947 in Kilmacthomas, County Waterford) is an Irish music venue and festival owner, and founder of Mean Fiddler who lives and operates in London.  Biography  On arrival in London from County Waterford, Power worked in various manual labour jobs, eventually moving into demolition, house clearances and most notably trading in second- hand furniture. Pioneering new methods of advertising his business, he soon had a host of second-hand furniture shops around North West London. The success of this business allowed him to pursue his first love, music, more specifically country & western. A trip to Tennessee and a desire to bring the sound of Nashville to London prompted Power to open the original Mean Fiddler, his country and western club, in 1982, in Harlesden, North West London, establishing it as a key venue for up and coming talent, Irish music and country stars. It was the start of a £60m empire that expanded to eight major music festivals, 14 live music venues and a string of successful nightclubs and restaurants. This background in authentic music has seen him repeatedly promote many famous artists of the rock and roll era including Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Roy Orbison, Paul Weller and Neil Young. He is a controversial figure in the UK music scene, and has a reputation for his hands on approach to business, spotting gaps in the market and quickly moving into them. He has earned the nickname 'The Godfather of Gigs'. In 1982 he opened The Mean Fiddler on the site of an old boxing gym in Harlesden. The venue quickly gained a reputation for its Irish music nights, showcasing new bands such as The Pogues and Billy Bragg. Within five years The Mean Fiddler was staging high-profile gigs by artists such as Roy Orbison, who played his last UK gig there in 1987, and Johnny Cash. By the late 1980s it had become a showcase venue for new and established talent within the capital's expanding live music scene. It was the springboard for expansion into other venues and bars and created an opportunity for Mean Fiddler Group, with Power at the helm, to enter the UK outdoor music festival market. Power moved to London at the age of 15 and resides there with his eight children.  Festivals  Power helped popularise festivals in the UK through the rise of Reading, Leeds, The Phoenix, The Fleadh, Madstock, and numerous other one offs including the first Sex Pistols re-union in Finsbury Park. In 1989, Mean Fiddler took over the organisation of the Reading Festival; acts included New Order, The Pogues, The Wonder Stuff and The Sugarcubes. Power is credited with reversing the fortunes of the long-established event, turning Reading into a highly anticipated and successful fixture on the annual festival calendar. Power sold his stake in The Mean Fiddler Music Group plc in July 2005, and went on to set up Vince Power Music Group. Power acquired one of Europe's most celebrated festivals, Benicàssim in 2005. Held in Spain, in a port town and beach resort located in Castelló, on the Costa del Azahar in Spain it is much more than just a music festival. Benicàssim Festival (FIB) sees over 100 acts perform over the four days; with four stages and eight days free camping. The festival is beach by day, music by night and is popular with thousands of UK festival goers who travel to Spain for the 'Glasto del Sol' experience each year. It was voted Best Overseas Festival in 2012 (UK Festival Awards), and features a line-up of international live acts, with a main focus on pop, rock and electronica artists. Hop Farm Music Festival was launched in 2008 by Power, and has been held annually since at The Hop Farm Country Park in Paddock Wood, Kent, England. After its first year it was nominated for 'Best New Festival' at the UK Festival Awards. The Hop Farm Music Festival was born after a survey conducted among festival fans revealed that they always felt the lowest in priority and importance. The survey resulted in the first Hop Farm Music Festival. In 2008, a 30,000 crowd capacity festival centred on folk and independent music, with a specific aim of a return to \\"back to basics\\" organisation with a no sponsorship, no branding, no VIP attitude. Under 12's, since the festival's creation, have had free entry. Previous acts include Blondie, Prince and Peter Gabriel. In September 2012, Vince Power Music Group entered administration and went into liquidation in November 2012, with a statement claiming \\"The board has in recent weeks pursued a number of different funding proposals but the company has not been able to procure the necessary funding it requires.\\" Kent Police and artists who appeared at that years Hop Farm Festival, including Primal Scream, Suede and Peter Gabriel were not paid, with the festival's debts totalling more than £4.8 million.http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/exclusive_hop_farm_festival_the_truth_about_extent_of_losses_1_1963805 July 2018 saw the launch of Power's new festival Feis, held at the Liverpool Pier Head.

Through various fundraising methods, including collections at the festivals, Power has helped to rebuild a primary school in Mostar, and in Thailand following the Tsumani. He is also closely associated with the Phillip Hall Memorial Fund, and is a patron of UNICEF, Human Rights Watch and the Depression Alliance.  Achievements and awards  Power has promoted many shows and been involved with many projects at The Roundhouse and has donated to their redevelopment of The Roundhouse which will have the 'Vince Power Music Studio' in his honour as well as being a patron of its Millennial Committee. In 2006, Power was appointed a CBE.

She was born Wendy Rose Ellis in Blackburn, and received her early training at the Carlotta School of Dance, later winning a British Ballet Organization scholarship. In 1963 she was selected to study at the Royal Ballet School, and moved to London with her parents to continue training. She started there in 1963 and joined the Royal Ballet in 1970.  Career = Early career at the Royal Ballet = Initially part of the corps de ballet, Ellis quickly progressed to solo roles such as Princess Florine in Sleeping Beauty, the Young Girl in Ashton's The Two Pigeons and Lise in another Ashton ballet, La fille mal gardée. It was during this time that she met and fell in love with her future husband Michael Somes. Ellis later danced in many Royal Ballet productions, with notable main/leading parts in ballets by Ashton (Cinderella, La fille mal gardée, Symphonic Variations, The Dream, Enigma Variations, A Month in the Country, Jazz Calendar, Les Patineurs, A Wedding Bouquet, Façade), alongside roles in his Les Rendezvous, Scènes de ballet, Birthday Offering, La Valse and Monotones I).

She retired from dancing in 1990. = Career as a ballet producer = After retiring, Ellis began to work more closely with Somes on ballet production. Somes and Ashton had been friends and collaborators since before World War II in 1939, and Somes had staged many of Ashton's ballets at the Royal Ballet and elsewhere after his retirement from classical dancing in 1961 (he continued in character roles for a number of years afterwards). Ashton bequeathed his Cinderella and Symphonic Variations to Somes on his death in 1988. Ellis and Somes together produced Cinderella with the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stockholm, and Symphonic Variations with American Ballet Theatre in New York. Somes subsequently willed his Ashton ballets to Ellis, and they passed to her on his death in 1994. Ellis subsequently produced Ashton's Cinderella with the National Ballet of Japan at the New National Theatre in Tokyo, the Royal Ballet itself (creating a new production with designers Toer van Schayk and Christine Haworth ), the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago and Los Angeles , the Polish National Ballet in Warsaw, Ballet West in Salt Lake City, Boston Ballet in Boston and American Ballet Theatre in New York.

Kochuraman leads a simple and happy life with his wife and son Kochuvava. Manorama \\"Thampuratti\\" is the daughter of a feudal lord of the ruling Brahmin family in the village. Thampuratti falls for Kochuraman and tries to gain his attention, ignoring the vast caste gap between them. Both of them are found together in her bedroom one day by the feudal lord.This results in Kochuraman being brutally murdered and his chopped off body being displayed for all the village to see while Manorama Thampuratti is paralysed for rest of her life by a deadly kick of the Thampuran in his rage. Kochuvava witnesses his father's body lying in the pool of blood under a coconut tree and despite his young age, he swears revenge upon his father's murderers. Kochuvava grows up into a ruthless and witty patriarch and capitalist amassing huge wealth through various legal and illegal ways, climbing the social ladder with the changing times. He ends up buying everything in the village including the kovilakam of the Namboothiris, whose current generation sold the land as they migrated to an urban life. For Kochuvava (Thilakan), nothing is more important than money and revenge in his life. Even his wife (Kaviyoor Ponnamma) and son (Vineeth) are secondary when it comes to that. In his quest for revenge, he bullies anyone and anything who dares to stand up to him. Despite being uneducated during changes around him, he manages his empire with his wit and ruthless efficiency. He plans to exact his ultimate vengeance by starting an illicit Arrack business in the kovilakam. This will serve to increase his profits as well as help drive out the last residents of the kovilakam - Manorama and a young girl who live their with their property overseer Raman Nair , after which he plans to dig a pond where the kovilalkam stands today. For Kochuvava, drinking a handful of water from that pond will mark his completion of his vengeance. However, this masterful long standing plan is strongly resented by his spoilt immature son Mohan, who also happens to be in love with the young and equally naive girl who is the titular \\"Kochuthampuratti\\" (Anju) of the kovilakam. Kochuvava mostly resents this relationship, accusing the Brahmin girl to be scheming to win all his wealth and offspring while Kochuvava was trying to win her house in exchange for money. One day both of the lovers (neither of who have a job or independent source of income or know of any way of life other than living off the assets of their parents) decide to live together and come and stay with Kochuvava. He initially refuses to let them stay here and threatens to make life impossible for them even if they are to go live in the old ruined palace. As Kochuvava thinks things over in the mediation of other friends and well wishers, the immature couple go and immediately hang themselves in the palace. Raman Nair, the overseer of the feudal family sees the hanging bodies. Kochuvava's words echo in his mind about the inevitability of his plan to start Arrack manufacturing in the upper caste homestead. He realizes the strength of Kochuvava's will upon seeing his own son and the youngest Brahmin dead as well. Unable to stand the caste humiliation any longer, he burns down the palace with Manorama alive inside it and goes and informs this to Kochuvava and the rest of the village. The film ends in a bitter tragedy for Kochuvava. The film ends with the lines that Kochuvava finally bowed his head for the first time in his life to love and fire. It is unclear what punishment was dealt to Raman Nair or whether this made any change in Kochuvava's plans to dig a pond where the palace once stood.

The festival was first held in 1797-98. Led by Gayan Bora and sounds of Doba, Kanh, Bhortal and Khol resonates amidst the audience to signal the start of the Barechaharia Bhaowna. This tradition that dates back two centuries, livens up the small town of Jamugurihat.  History  Barechaharia Bhaona has changed a lot in the 220 years since its inception, when Hukai Dekagiri first organised it at Raghudoloni-Pothar (paddy field) of the village Pasigaon in present day Jamugurihat of Assam in 1797. This festival is celebrated every five years on the full moon day of Chot (usually in March or April) as per the Assamese Calendar. Recently however, locals have agreed to celebrate this event on the full moon day of Fagoon (usually in February or March) to avoid conflict with the April Bordoichila (\\"thunderstorm\\"). The convergence of religion and culture has given this festival a strong fabric to survive over the years while retaining its quality of storytelling. Typically the Bhaona is a dramatization of stories from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas. However, in this style created by the Mahapurush Sankardev, a Vaishnavite saint is depicted with Bhakti Rasa in the form of different Raga & Tala. The main target of the saint was to unite the diverse society with the spirit of entertainment and promote the vaishnavism preached by Him.  Bhaona customs  The Bhaona is held in a Namghar, the traditional prayer house of a village unit called Khel, and also in Sattras, a monastery-like institution promoting the Sankari culture, founded by Sankardev. In the traditional Bhaona, there are a group singers and drummers who begin the orchestra (Jora) in Sankari style followed by the entry of Sutradhar who recites slokas and narrates the entire story of the drama to be performed. The director, known as Gayanbora, lets other performers know when to make their entry onto the stage. Nam prasanga meanskirtana also is an integral part of the Bhaona. Brajabuli is used to script the dialogues. The concept of Barechaharia Bhaona is derived from the traditional Bhaona and in this festival, unlike other Bhaona, it is performed simultaneously by teams from the different villages of the region on several stages with the holy altar in the center.

They were used during World War I as part of the Second Air Instructional Center (2d AIC), American Expeditionary Forces for training United States airmen prior to being sent into combat. Today Tours Airdrome #1 airfield is Tours Val de Loire Airport (Base Aérienne 604). Background The airfield complex is located about three miles northwest of the city of Tours, Department of Indre- et-Loire, on the main road to Vendome.Series \\"J\\", Volume 7, History of the 1st, 2d, 4th, 7th and 8th Aviation Instruction Centers, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917-1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. via http://www.fold3.com Tours initially was established by the French Aeronautique Militaire as a training school for pilots prior to the United States entry into World War I. On 23 July 1917, a group of 47 enlisted Air Service men arrived in France on the SS Orduna. Ten members were ordered to Paris to receive ground commissions while the balance were sent to Tours for flying training. The training was provided by an agreement made with the French to train a limited number of Americans, then the entire school would be turned over to the Headquarters Air Service, American Expeditionary Force on 1 September. However, owing to a limited number of personnel available, the French retained overall control of the school until the end of the war in November 1918. A number of secondary training airfields, along with the main complex were established: * Spiral (later Combat) Field #3 between Monnaie and Langennerie. * Farman Field #4 , at Rochecorbon, used for aerial gunnery. * Spiral Field (New) #6 , at Meslay. * Monnaie Field #8 , at \\"La Feuillée\\". * At \\"Les Bois-Métais\\", northwest of Reugny (NE of the field), 225 acres were requisitioned on 14 September 1918 for another new training field, but the procedure was cancelled on 18 November before any work began. There were two other training grounds: Larçay, for aerial gunnery as at Field #4 à Rochecorbon, and at \\"Le Ruchard\\", east of Chinon, for artillery cooperation; those two grounds could have been the missing Fields #5 and #7... Also four emergency fields were located near Saint-Avertin, south of the Cher River about four miles south of the main airfield (#1). In addition to the pilot training, the 2d AIC eventually developed specialist schools in Aerial Observation, Radio, Photography and Aerial Gunnery. The training complexes at Issoudun Aerodrome (3d AIC) and Tours were the two largest training schools in France for Air Service pilots. Operations Map of Second Air Instructional Center, Tours Aerodrome, France. The first Air Service training class arrived at Tours on 15 August, and followed a detachment of United States Naval cadets that had completed their training at Tours a few days before. Like the Naval aviators, the Army fliers were allotted in groups to classes under French instructors. The rivalry between cadets was intense, for the honor at stake was that of being the first pilot of the Air Service to be breveted in France. It was finally shared between two, Oscar G. Gude and J. W. Watts, later 1st Lieutenants, who completed their training on 11 September 1917. The first class was succeeded by the second, third and fourth classes, largely recruited from Americans who had volunteered prior to the United States entry in the war and were serving with the French forces. They were, in turn, followed by classes of cadets which arrived from the United States. On 1 November 1918, a transfer ceremony was held which turned over control of the school to the AEF, however, it was necessary to retain French instruction personnel. It was planned for the school to produce 100 trained pilots per month, however during its first four months of operation, the number was less than 40, with the exception of October 1917, when 55 pilots graduated. At the time, only the main field was in use, and the entire school was equipped with about 50 or 60 Caudron G.3E2 trainers, all of which were well-used and in constant need of repair, having been rebuilt from wrecked trainers. On 1 February 1918, additional flight instructors arrived from the United States, and during the winter two additional airfields were constructed. With the additional number of personnel, 30 additional training aircraft and facilities, the scope of training was greatly increased. From Tours, the graduates were sent to the 3d AIC at Issoudun Aerodrome for advanced training. The receipt of dual control (D2) trainers reduced the number of accidents and improved the number of solo flying when that stage of training was reached. During February 1918, 45 pilots graduated; in March 104. An average of about 80 pilots graduated each month afterwards. Second Air Instructional Center - Thanksgiving Dinner Menu 1918 The Observers School was opened in January 1918. In addition to the Caudrons, British Sopwith Pups, along with Breguet 14s were utilized. The course given to observers was intended to cover all areas necessary to qualify the observer for front-line duty. Both new personnel were trained, as well as observers trained in the United States, which received training in specialized areas which updated their training already received to meet new conditions and included new methods developed on the front. During the spring of 1918, the main #1 field was used mostly for training aerial photographers; the Farman Field (#4) was used for soloing, and some De Haviland DH-4s were received which were used there along with the Breguets. Additional buildings were constructed during the summer of 1918 included 23 barracks, 3 maintenance shops, 10 warehouses and 3 hangars. These additional resources made possible the establishment of Radio and other smaller schools, along with the aerial gunnery school, with a gunnery range being established. By September 1918, the operations of the Tours School were in full swing. The work over the previous year in establishing facilities, curriculum and establishing instructor corps in various disciplines had paid off. The maximum number of flying personnel was reached in November, when there were 139 staff pilots on duty at the station. By then, two shifts were provided, with the long daylight hours of summer providing up to 14 or 15 hours each day for training. The coming of the armistice on 11 November 1918 ended the formal training program at the school. By then facilities included 10 Cathedral hangars, 17 steel hangars, 4 Bressenau hangars and 18 single-plane canvas hangars. Aircraft included 9 Caudrons, 10 Niewports, 12 Salmsons, 43 Breguets, 47 De Haviland 4s, 25 Sopwiths, and 4 Spad XIIIs. A support station of 50 buildings, schools, barracks, and other buildings had been erected. Students in training were given opportunity to complete their training, but no new students were accepted. All student training was completed by 31 December.

In 1991, he exhibited in the \\"Artists of Petersburg and Restructuring\\" show, at the Salon Drouot in Paris, at the exhibition \\"Petersburg Artists in Helsinki\\" in Helsinki, and at a solo show at the Salon \\"Nimble\\" in New York City. Since 1991, Kryjevski has lived and worked in Brooklyn, New York. In 1992, his works were shown as part of the city's largest annual exhibition, held at the Jacob Javits Center. Certain of his paintings have been auctioned by Christie's in 1990 and by Sotheby's in 1992. A number of Kryjevski's works are in the collection of the State Tretyakov Gallery, the collections of the Bashkir GHM, the MV Nesterov, and the city museums of Petrozavodsk, Yaroslavl, Vologda, and Novosibirsk. Many of his works are also in private collections in Russia and abroad, including collections in Austria, Belgium, United States, France, Sweden, and Finland.

George Alexander Baird (30 September 1861 – 18 March 1893) was a wealthy British race horse owner, breeder and the most successful amateur jockey (gentleman rider) of his day, who rode under the assumed name of Mr Abington. He was a controversial figure, at times in conflict with the establishment, \\"warned off\\" for his aggressive riding behaviour, implicated in a prize fight fixing scandal. and named as co-respondent in two divorce cases. He had a relationship with Lillie Langtry, noted actress and former mistress of the Prince of Wales (King Edward VII). Baird died at age thirty-three of pneumonia in a hotel room in New Orleans, Louisiana, after traveling there for prize fights with men he sponsored.  Family fortune  The Baird family wealth came from the industry of grandfather Alexander Baird (1765–1833) and seven of his sons who worked numerous coal and mineral leases in Scotland from 1816. They built ironworks that within 15 years developed as the largest in the country, and in 1830, formed William Baird and Company. The industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways brought the family the wealth that they used to buy land and property in Scotland. Baird's inheritance included that of his father plus two of his wealthy uncles who had died childless.  Education  Baird was nine years old when his father died in 1870. His inheritance was held in trust until he became of age. The funds released by the trustees during his minority were insufficient for his education, so his mother (successfully) petitioned the courts for the release of additional money. He attended the private school St Michael's, Aldin House, Slough before going to Eton, where he lasted but one year (1875). He later attended Magdalene College, Cambridge from 1879 to 1881, and never graduated.  Early influence  His mother was unable or unwilling to discipline Baird after his father's death, and was said to have indulged him. She was Cecilia, eldest daughter of Vice Admiral Villiers Francis Hatton who had married Baird's father in 1858 when she was 35 and he was 48. Their only child George Alexander Baird was born to them three years later. He grew up with older parents and no siblings for company. His fondness for horses and riding out, plus \\"amusement in the groom's room,\\" provided escape and distraction for the young boy. In his book Turf Memories of Sixty Years, Alexander Scott writes that he met the teenage Baird and subsequently followed the career of \\"this great horseman\\". He wrote, \\"Love of horses was his bond of friendship, and he would extend that to everyone irrespective of social standing. He would have discussed horses with a dustman\\". Baird's interest in the \\"Turf\\" may also have been encouraged by the example of his cousins Douglas Baird, who was a successful owner, and Edward (Ned) Baird, who would become a gentleman rider and owner.  Riding career of \\"Mr Abington\\"  Because his trustees disapproved of his association with horse racing, young Baird used an alias when riding, and chose \\"Mr Abington\\". He continued to use this name for the rest of his life for both riding and entering horses in races. Baird's desire to win was obsessive. During his early days on the track, he became known for aggressive riding; he was warned by stewards and eventually, following an incident with another gentleman rider (Lord Harrington) at Four Oaks, Birmingham in 1882, he was banned for two years. This was referred to as being \\"Warned Off.\\" He could not ride, or run horses during the period of the ban under National Hunt or Jockey Club rules. He transferred his horses to an acquaintance − Ross (Stiffy) Smith − and allowed them to race under Smith's colours whilst continuing to ride in races in France. After the ban was lifted, Baird returned to racing in Britain. He had changed his colours to bottle-green jacket and red cap, and started to put together a string of quality horses with the advice of jockey and trainer Tom Cannon. He engaged champion jockey Fred Archer to help improve his race-riding technique. In his first season following the ban, Baird rode 13 winners under Jockey Club rules, 22 in 1885, 28 in 1886, 46 in 1887, 36 in 1888 and, in his best year of 1889, 61. To put his achievements into context, in 1889, the next best amateur rider in the list rode only three winners whilst the professional Champion Jockey (Tommy Loates) rode 167. Baird would never again achieve such success; the following year he had 42 winners and in 1891 26. Baird was tall for a jockey and constantly struggled with his weight, living on a starvation diet when riding, exercising, and sweating off weight before races. In his great year of 1889, he could make 9 stone and 11 pounds. For all his dieting and attempts at weight loss, he could never get down to the levels of professional jockeys. For example, Tommy Loates could make 7 stone 1 pound and Fred Archer, who was the same height as Baird, was almost a stone less than him. In many \\"handicap\\" races Baird would be competitive where the weights carried by the horses were adjusted to provide an even contest. If there were a chance of riding a winner, he would travel any distance, once even hiring a train to get to a meeting. If he did not have a suitable horse of his own available, he would ride for other owners.  \\"Mr Abington\\" the owner  By the time Baird returned after the ban, he had inherited his family fortune and started to buy race horses; Tom Cannon – great-grandfather of Lester Piggott – acted as his adviser. They attended a dispersal sale for Lord Falmouth's stables, buying some quality horses, including a three-year-old filly called Busybody. Tom Cannon rode her to victories in the 1,000 Guineas Stakes at Newmarket and the Oaks at Epsom in that same year. Busybody produced a foal called Meddler that was sold to America after Baird's death; he became a very successful and influential stallion at stud. Bedford Lodge (now a hotel) Baird continued to buy horses (often selling platers), leased Bedford Lodge stables in Newmarket, Suffolk, from Captain James Machell, and employed Martin Gurry as his trainer. He also used Tom and William Stevens in Berkshire, Bob Armstrong of Penrith, James Prince at Lewes and others, once remarking that he was not sure how many horses he owned. His stud was at Kentford near Newmarket (now called Meddler Stud), and he later transferred it to Moulton Paddocks in 1892. Baird also leased Whittington Old Hall for a period, and resided there when attending meets in the area. Martin Gurry found Baird difficult to work for. During one of their disputes, Baird withdrew all of his horses and sent them to William Stevens, including a horse called Merry Hampton. Baird and Gurry made up their differences, and the horses were returned to Bedford Lodge in time for Merry Hampton to run in The Derby, which he duly won (1887). All expected Baird to lead Merry Hampton into the winners' enclosure after the race, as was normal for the winning owner of the Derby. However, he refused, and this was seen as a snub to the \\"establishment,\\" with which he was often at odds. This mutual antipathy was in stark contrast to the relationship that Baird's cousin Douglas had with the establishment. He was elected as a member of the Jockey Club in 1887. Baird replaced Gurry at Bedford Lodge with Charles Morton in 1888. Baird did not settle his dispute with Gurry over his contract until 1890. Morton lasted four years, to be replaced by Joe Cannon, younger brother of Tom. Charles Mowbey was Baird's general manager and Jack Watts his retained jockey. Martin Gurry used the money he received from Baird to build a stable in Newmarket, from where he trained for 27 years. He named the establishment Abington Place. As well as winning the Derby in 1887, Baird topped the owners' list with 46 wins for his horses. It was said that Baird was most interested in riding winners himself, but this was not always possible due to restrictions on some meetings, where amateur riders could not compete, or his weight precluded him.  Private life  In 1890, Baird was named as co- respondent in the divorce case brought by Francis Darbishire against his wife actress Agnes Hewitt. Baird's defence was that he did not know she was married, but he was ordered to pay damages to the plaintiff. Baird also was involved with former actress Dolly Tester, the wife of his friend Lord Ailesbury, and was named in their divorce proceedings as a co-respondent. The farcical events that led up to this include a \\"kidnap\\" and a public fight between the lord, the \\"kidnapper,\\" and Dolly. In 1884 Baird was charged with assaulting a policeman at Whittington. The charge was reduced to one of obstruction after the evidence was heard (Baird had threatened to kick the policeman) and Baird fined £5. Baird and actress Lillie Langtry became involved. They met at a race meeting at Newmarket in April 1891 when Baird offered her some advice on betting. He was so confident of the result, he is said to have even given her the stake money. A relationship developed, and Baird made many gifts to Langtry, including money, race horses, and a 200-ft luxury yacht (White Ladye). He was also very jealous and at times became violent toward her. Lillie and her affairs gave the gossip columnists of the day much to write about. Baird was said to be thoughtful and generous, once sending his doctor to Paris to help an acquaintance who was very ill. However, many saw the worst in him when he could be boorish or bad-tempered, even throwing tantrums. When out drinking, Baird often made a nuisance of himself, but few would dare challenge him because his drinking companions included prize fighters. He financially compensated those he had affronted. A fellow gentleman rider – Arthur Yates – was quoted as saying of Baird, \\"I liked him very much, but unfortunately he did not choose his friends wisely, and the results were disastrous. None of his companions, however, came with him to Bishop Sutton, for he knew I would not tolerate any of them, and thus I always saw the best side of his nature, which was, at bottom, very gentle and pleasant.\\" Baird acquired his London house at 36 Curzon Street during an evening of dining and drinking with its then owner Sir George Chetwynd, another man of the turf. Baird expressed his admiration for the property, at which point Chetwynd sold it to him with all fixtures and fitting. Baird woke next morning in the master bedroom with a hangover and was told that he was the new owner.  Prize fighting  Baird became interested in prize fighting after seeing bouts at a hostelry in Newmarket. Prize fighting was illegal at the time, so the contests were conducted clandestinely. He set up his own boxing room at Bedford Lodge and invited prize fighters of the day, such as Charlie Mitchell and Jem Smith. Attempts were being made at this time to regulate prize fighting, and a group of gentlemen came together to form the Pelican Club, where fights were held in strict adherence to the \\"Queensbury Rules.\\" Baird became a member of the club, but was expelled after becoming involved in a fight scandal. Frank Slavin and Jem Smith fought a match in Bruges. When the fight appeared to be going against Baird's man (Smith), bystanders invaded the ring, and the fight had to be stopped and declared a draw. This coincided with some heavy betting that had been laid on this result, and the committee of the Pelican Club put the blame squarely on Baird's shoulders. He took them to court in an effort to be reinstated, but failed; on 7 March 1890, Mr Justice Stirling, Chancery Court found against him. Baird was spending less time on horse racing and more on prize fighting. In 1893, he visited America with Charlie Mitchell and Jem Hall plus their trainers to challenge \\"Gentleman\\" Jim Corbett to a bout. Whilst waiting for Corbett to respond, a fight was set up between Jem Hall and Bob Fitzsimmons in New Orleans. Hall was beaten and Baird, who had been in his corner, took to the town to drown his sorrows. He caught a chill and woke next morning with a fever. Mitchell left the sick Baird in the St Charles Hotel, returning to New York to follow up his challenge with Corbett. Baird died of pneumonia on 18 March 1893, having been treated by three doctors, who had kept friends informed in England by telegram. The British Consul intervened to arrange for his body to be returned to England for burial. Baird was buried in the churchyard at Stichill next to his father. In his will, he left his estate in trust to his mother, who died age 73 in 1895; she, too, was buried in Stichill. The pall bearers at Baird's funeral included seven cousins, one of whom was John George Alexander Baird, the member of parliament for Central Glasgow. Charlie Mitchell attended the funeral but did not join the procession.

Exceptions include financial services, gambling, healthcare by regulated professionals, package travel, property transactions, social services, timeshare and most aspects of passenger transport. Content The Consumer Rights Directive contains provisions on: *Information to be given before a consumer buys goods or services on the trader’s premises *Information to be given before a consumer buys goods or services away from the trader's premises (e.g. at home or at a fair), or at a distance (internet, telesales) *Cancellation rights and responsibilities where the consumer buys goods or services away from the trader's premises or at a distance *Delivery times for goods – clarifying what deadlines for delivery should be and where responsibilities lie if there is a problem *Post-contract customer helplines, where existing customers must be charged no more than the basic rate for phone calls *Additional payments (on top of the main price of a purchase) which would need to have active or express consent of the consumer. An example is that pre-ticked boxes which the consumer must 'untick' will no longer be allowed *Fees charged for a particular method of payment (e.g. credit card surcharges). Implementation The UK government held a consultation in 2012. The new laws overhaul a number of consumer protection measures originally enacted long before the rise of internet shopping and fit together with a number of other changes to form a new Consumer Bill of Rights replacing more than a dozen older, often overlapping and inconsistent laws. Outdated Spanish mortgage laws have already been shown to be in breach of the new rules and must conform.

It is a similar approach to the waste hierarchy for minimising resource depletion, and adopts a parallel sequence. The highest priorities cover the prevention of unnecessary energy usage both through eliminating waste and improving energy efficiency. The sustainable production of energy resources is the next priority. Depletive and waste-producing energy generation options are the lowest priority. For an energy system to be sustainable: the resources applied to producing the energy must be capable of lasting indefinitely; energy conversion should produce no harmful by-products, including net emissions, nor wastes which cannot be fully recycled; and it must be capable of meeting reasonable energy demands. Energy saving The top priority under the Energy Hierarchy is energy conservation or the prevention of unnecessary use of energy. This category includes eliminating waste by turning off unneeded lights and appliances and by avoiding unnecessary journeys. Heat loss from buildings is a major source of energy wastage, so improvements to building insulation and air-tightness can make a significant contribution to energy conservation. Many countries have agencies to encourage energy saving. Energy efficiency The second priority under the energy hierarchy is to ensure that energy that is used is produced and consumed efficiently. Energy efficiency has two main aspects. =Conversion efficiency of energy consumption= Energy efficiency is the ratio of the productive output of a device to the energy it consumes. Energy efficiency was a lower priority when energy was cheap and awareness of its environmental impact was low. In 1975 the average fuel economy of a car in the US was under 15 miles per gallon Incandescent light bulbs, which were the most common type until the late 20th century, waste 90% of their energy as heat, with only 10% converted to useful light. More recently, energy efficiency has become a priority. The last reported average fuel efficiency of US cars had almost doubled from the 1975 level; LED lighting is now being promoted which are between five and ten times more efficient than incandescents. Many household appliances are now required to display labels to show their energy efficiency. =Conversion efficiency of energy production= Losses are incurred when energy is harvested from the natural resource from which it is derived, such as fossil fuels, radioactive materials, solar radiation or other sources. Most electricity production is in thermal power stations, where much of the source energy is lost as heat. The average efficiency of world electricity production in 2009 was c.37%. A priority in the Energy Hierarchy is to improve the efficiency of energy conversion, whether in traditional power stations or by improving the performance ratio of Photovoltaic power stations and other energy sources. Overall efficiency and sustainability can also be improved by capacity- or fuel-switching from less efficient, less sustainable resources to better ones; but this is mainly covered under the fourth level of the hierarchy. Sustainable energy production Renewable energy describes naturally occurring, theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy. These sources are treated as being inexhaustible, or naturally replenished, and fall into two classes. =Elemental renewables= The first class of renewables derive from climatic or elemental sources, such as sunlight, wind, waves, tides or rainfall (hydropower). Geothermal energy from the heat of the earth's core also falls in this category. These are treated as being inexhaustible because most derive ultimately from energy emanating from the sun, which has an estimated life of 6.5 billion years. =Bio-energy= The other main class of renewables, bioenergy, derives from biomass, where the relatively short growing cycle means that usage is replenished by new growth. Bioenergy is usually converted by combustion, and therefore gives rise to carbon emissions. It is treated as carbon neutral overall, because an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide will have been extracted from the atmosphere during the growing cycle. Bioenergy sources can be solid, such as wood and energy crops; liquid, such as biofuels; or gaseous, such as biomethane from anaerobic digestion. Low impact energy production The next priority in the hierarchy covers energy sources that are not entirely sustainable, but have a low environmental impact. These include the use of fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. Nuclear energy is sometimes treated as a low impact source, because it has low carbon emissions. High impact energy production The lowest priority under the energy hierarchy is energy production using unsustainables sources, such as unabated fossil fuels. Some also place nuclear energy in this category, rather than the one above, because of the required management/storage of highly hazardous radioactive waste over extremely long (hundreds of thousands of years or more) timeframes and depletion of uranium resources. There is a consensus that the share of such energy sources must decline. Within this tier, there are possibilities for limiting adverse impacts by switching from the most damaging fuel sources, such as coal, to less emissive sources, such as gas. Many suggest that when such high impact energy usage has been minimised, the effects of any unavoidable residual usage should be counterbalanced by emissions offsetting. Origins of the energy hierarchy The Energy Hierarchy was first proposed in 2005 by Philip Wolfe, when he was Director General of the Renewable Energy Association. This first version had three levels; energy efficiency, renewables and traditional energy production. It was endorsed and adopted in 2006 by a consortium of institutions, associations and other bodies in the Sustainable Energy Manifesto. Subsequently, the concept has been adopted and refined by others in the energy industry and in government.

He is the founder and current director of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program at the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. Since 1985 he has conducted over a thousand oral histories of retired American diplomats. Biography Born in Chicago in 1928, Kennedy moved with his mother and two elder brothers to the Pasadena area of California in the early 1930s, where he attended a series of public elementary schools. Later his mother took him to Annapolis where a brother attended the Naval Academy. Living in Annapolis he developed a strong interest in history, particularly American. He went to Kent School in Connecticut, graduating in 1946 then on to Williams College where he obtained an honors degree in history. Upon graduating in 1950, Kennedy joined the United States Air Force as an enlisted man in the intelligence branch. After a year's study of Russian at the Army Language School in Monterrey, California, he served in Korea during the Korean War and Germany. At the end of his four-year enlistment he studied at Boston University and received a MA in history. Having taken and passed the Foreign Service written examination in 1954 he took the oral examination after leaving the Air Force and passed that hurdle and entered the Foreign Service in 1955. Work In his 30 years in the Foreign Service Kennedy was a consular officer dealing with the protection of American citizens abroad, the issuance of visas to foreigners and assistance to the growing throng of Americans visiting overseas in Frankfurt, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, then in the war zone of South Vietnam as consul general, then in more peaceful Athens, Greece, Seoul, South Korea and finally Naples, Italy as consul general. Kennedy retired from the Foreign Service in 1985 and wrote a well-received history of the United States Consular Service which was published in 1990 by the Greenwood Press. A revised edition was published in 2015 and covered the years up to 1924. Realizing that the work of American diplomats was barely acknowledged, except for a few great names, such as Benjamin Franklin, in the teaching of American history, he started an oral history program, first at George Washington University in 1985 and then at Georgetown University. These efforts were barely funded and the oral history did not have much support until the creation of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training in 1986 by a group of retired Foreign Service officers. Since that time Stu Kennedy has been director of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program of the Association. He has conducted some 1,000 oral histories of retired American diplomats whose careers range from the 1920s to the present. These are inclusive interviews running about 10 hours, especially those done in later periods, and cover early childhood, education, experiences outside the diplomatic period as well as service to the State Department. Both career and non-career officers are covered. The texts of the interviews are available on the Library of Congress's website, Frontline Diplomacy, and on the website of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. Kennedy was awarded the Foreign Service Cup from the Director General of the Foreign Service in 1997 for his work as an oral historian and in 2014 received the Award for Lifetime Contribution to American Diplomacy from the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). As of 2017 he is still conducting interviews. In 2014 Charles S. Kennedy was presented the Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy Award by the American Foreign Service Association.

Properties and preparation Germanium(II) hydroxide is formed as a white or yellow precipitate when base is added to solutions containing GeII, produced for example by the reduction of an acid solution of germanium dioxide, GeO2, with hypophosphorous acid, H3PO2, or alternatively by hydrolysis of GeCl2. The initial precipitate, which has no definite stoichiometry, can be represented by GeO·xH2O, Ge(OH)2·xH2O, or loosely Ge(OH)2. It is only slightly soluble in water or alkali and not appreciably soluble in perchloric acid, HClO4, but is soluble in hydrochloric acid, HCl. On digestion with sodium hydroxide, NaOH, it yields a brown insoluble compound, which after drying in vacuo forms a brown pyrophoric substance with the approximate stoichiometry of (HGe)2O3.

When English colonists arrived and settled on the Ashley River, the neighboring Kiawah were friendly. thumb The Kiawah and the Etiwan tribe were the two principle Cusabo tribes close to the Charleston Harbor. While some other South Carolinian lowland tribes were not consistently associated with the Cusabo, the Kiawah were consistently a part of the Cusabo. The first record of Kiawah Cusabo alliance membership was in a 1707 agreement, in which the Kiawah was assuredly mentioned. However, by 1682, disease and warfare had reduced Kiawah numbers to about 160.Cobb, Ashton. 2006. Kiawah Island: A History. The History Press. pages 24-25.  Cultural Features = Geography = The Kiawah lived on or near the Ashley River from 1598-1682 and then on Kiawah Island from 1682-1695. Though the location of this is now unknown, the Kiawah were granted a land request for a reservation south of the Combahee River. = Language = In 1605 and 1609 a Spanish colonizer employed a native of Santa Elena who spoke Spanish and was able to translate the language of the Kiawah. The Kiawah, along with other members of the Cusabo, ranged in territory throughout lowland region, and it is presumed that the Cusabo tribes spoke similar, if not the same language, referred generally as the Cusaboan language. American Linguist Blair Rudes proposed that Arawakan interpretations of the name ending -bo corresponds to the naming of locations associated with the Cusabo tribes including the Kiawah, but there has been no solid proof confirming this linguistic relationship. = Colonizer Arrival = Attempted settlements were made in the area by the French in 1562 and the Spaniards beginning in 1566. After being driven out in 1576, the Spanish returned and burned most if not all of the Cusabo villages of the Cusabo and the Guale. In 1598 the Kiawah and Escamacu raided Guale. During the Yamsee War, the Kiawah fought with the English against the Yamasee, Creek, Cherokee, Catawba and other nations seeking revenge for abuse by traders. The Cassique of Kiawah was a term to refer to the chieftain or tribal leader. The Cassique negotiated relations with English settlers to improve trade relations, foster peace and tranquility, and cultivate an alliance with the English for the sake of protection. English settler Robert Sanford wrote in his 1666 recollections that a Kiawah tribe member known by the title of Cassique welcomed him earnestly to the Kiawah \\"assuring [him] a broad deep entrance, and promising a large welcome and plentiful entertainment and trade.\\" Supposedly it was the Cassique's pride for his country that encouraged the English to solidify the creation of their settlement. Another English settler, Nicolas Carteret, recorded his travels from Bermuda to the Ashley (Kiawah) river in a later. His visit to the Port Royal (Charleston Harbor area was due to the fact that a settlement had been constructed there in April of 1670. A Kiawah native called Cassique assisted in the travels of Cartaret, who remarked that he was \\"a very ingenious Indian, and a great linguist.\\" = Census Information = By 1682, the date of the earliest census, the number of bowmen for the Kiawah tribe had been reduced to 40, with the total Cusabo population at an estimated 664. By the time of the 1715 census, the total Cusabo population excluding the Etiwan was 535: 95 men and 200 children. Severe population depletion was attributed to smallpox and other diseases in combination with attacks by the Spaniards and Indian allies of the French.

When Vueti reached Bau island, he ordered for a sacred temple to be built and buried the sacred stone (tawake kei Viti) at the foundation mound and named the temple as Vatanitawake translated as 'the shelter or shelve of the signifying authority award/flag of Fiji'.

Vueti is buried at Kubuna in a mound called Tabukasivi, and was deified and became the ancestral god of the people of Kubuna, they worshiped him in the form of a serpent. After his death a division arose over the installation of a successor to Vueti. Eventually a new Roko Tui Bau, Ratu Serumataidrau, was selected from the Vuaniivi, which was the senior line.

Those that went to Moala travelled considerably more and were led by lineal descendants of Roko Nadurucoko and therefore claimed collateral descent from Vueti. They dispersed to Totoya and even to Tonga. Some returned and they gathered once again first at Verata then at Nayavu (second time). From there they split, one group left Nayavu to settle at Kaba peninsula, they took the name Tui Kaba. The second group called the Vunivalu continued travelling first to Viria, before ending up at Ovea.Na Sala Vakavanua: A Study in Fijian Ethnology and Customs, unpublished paper, 1942 All groups acknowledged the Roko Tui Bau as paramount but due to their separation, they were quite independent as well. At some point, the Roko Tui Bau settled on the island called Ulunivuaka that was already home to the Butoni and Levuka peopleA History of Fiji ,Chapter 4 Page 54 and 55 The island was renamed Bau in honour of the Roko Tui Bau. The Vusaratu and the Tui Kaba, together with their warriors of the Vusaradave were the first to settle the island, the Butoni were expelled to resettle at Namacu in Koro. The Levuka remained and served as fisherfolk and navy, moving to the hill on the center of the island to leave the more desirable spots to their social betters. In 1760, legend has it that the Vunivalu people found that the Levuka were keeping the choicest seafood and deepsea fish for themselves and presenting smaller specimens for the Sevu or tribute. In retaliation, Nailatikau, chief of the Tokatoka Vunivalu promptly expelled the Butoni (who eventually settled at Lakeba). In the same move, he took the additional name Nadurucoko established himself as the first Vunivalu of Bau or secular chief, reunifying the two groups that had originally split at Moala and aggregating to himself the title of Tui Kaba, much to the chagrin of the latter as they were the senior line of Nadurucoko I. Nailatikau was succeeded by Banuve, who in the 30 years as Vunivalu, reclaimed wide areas of the adjacent reef flats and built up stone docks and sea walls. He allowed new fisherfolk from Beqa and Kadavu to settle on the island and establish the villages of Lasakau and Soso. Those of Lasakau were the core of the new Bauan navy.

O'Keefe Cultural Center of Arts and Education in Ocean Springs, MS for a total of six days in May and September 2012 to work on Translation Wave. With access to the building's Scharr-Ello studio, performance arts room, and main theater the trio was once again free to explore their sound within high ceilings and stairwells in one of the coast's most richly and artistically diversified areas. Chris Staples (TwoThirtyEight, Discover America, Telekinesis) was invited in to engineer three of the EP's more percussion oriented tracks (BlackSound, Particle and Wave, Reynosa). Style In this new collection of music we find a more intimate, cinematic, and sporadic group of songs. Translation Wave is an expression of how a band can morph and evolve from time on the road and turn to reflect on those experiences through instrumentation. Having already freed themselves of popular expectations on the previous album, El Cantador appears willing and able to take us anywhere at any time without notice. In the EP's first track, \\"BlackSound\\", the listener is greeted by a sparse and intricately picked out acoustic guitar riff alongside Underwood's immediate foretelling to \\"Don't buy into most of my dreams/I'll make your head spin with my own disconnectivity\\" - lyrics which imply Underwood's satisfaction in playing with language and could serve to intimate the EP's darker hues and cathartic uplifts. Translation Wave proudly hums with a warmth and rawness akin to older classic albums you might find in your local record bin.

He is better known by the title Shahnawaz Khan or Mirza Deccan. Shahnawaz Khan was the father-in-law of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and his younger brother Prince Murad Baksh. Family and lineage Shahnawaz Khan was the son of Mirza Rustam Safavi, who rose to eminence during Emperor Jahangir's reign. He belonged to the lineage of the old Mashad princes of Iran - his great- grandfather was a son of Shah Ismail I of the Safavid Empire. He was married to Nauras Banu Begum, the daughter of Mirza Muhammad Sharif. The couple were the parents of two sons and five daughters, including Dilras Banu Begum, who married Prince Muhi-ud-din (later known as Aurangzeb upon his accession), the third son of Emperor Shah Jahan in 1637. Another daughter of his married Aurangzeb's youngest brother, Prince Murad Bakhsh in 1638. At the Mughal court Shahnawaz Khan was made viceroy of Gujarat and ataliq to Shah Jahan's son, Prince Murad Baksh, at the time of his assignment to the Deccan. Shahnawaz Khan was imprisoned by his son-in-law, Aurangzeb, in the Burhanpur fort in 1658 for not supporting him in the war of succession. Khan, instead of supporting his son-in-law, chose to support Aurangzeb's oldest brother, Crown Prince Dara Shikoh, the heir-apparent chosen by Emperor Shah Jahan. This resulted in a conflict of interests between Aurangzeb and him. Aurangzeb released him seven months later, upon the intercession of his eldest daughter Princess Zeb-un-Nisa and appointed him the viceroy of Gujarat. Death Shahnawaz Khan died during the battle of Ajmer on 14 March 1659 and was buried in Ajmer Sharif, Rajasthan by the orders of Aurangzeb.

The original pass was followed by the development of improved routes, all in the same vicinity and all bearing the same name. In the early days of European settlement at the Cape, only three routes permitted the passage of ox-wagons through the chain of unbroken mountains running north to south and isolating Cape Town from the interior - Gantouw Kloof in the south, Piekenierskloof Pass some 170 km north and the Roodezand Pass about midway between them.The Romance of Cape Mountain Passes - Graham Ross (David Philip, 2007) Pieter Potter was a surveyor who had been sent in 1658 by Jan van Riebeeck to barter cattle from the Khoi herders who were known to be in that area. His party camped at the southern end of Voelvlei Dam from where Potter climbed to the summit of the ridge nearby, but saw no cattle or herders. Returning to the foot of the mountain, he moved north to where the Klein Berg River issued from a precipitous gorge. Potter tried to negotiate the gorge, but the sheer cliffs eventually halted his progress. Retracing his steps, he ventured further north on the west flank of the range until he found a route where he could hike to the top without much effort. From the summit he found that he had a sweeping view of the country beyond, and which had been named Roodezand Valley for the red hue of the sand and rocks at its north-western end. This way over the mountain, about 4 km north of Gouda, became known as Roodezand Pass.The First Burghers at the Cape\\" - Theal For the next forty years nothing was done to improve the Pass. In 1699 Willem Adriaan van der Stel, the newly appointed Governor, decided to open the valley for farming and found it necessary to upgrade the Pass. It was particularly steep on the eastern slopes of the mountain, forcing wagons to be unloaded and dismantled, then carried piecemeal over the slopes on the backs of cattle and drivers. By the 1750s negotiating the Pass had become extremely wearying, and a concerted effort was made to find a route through the kloof which had defeated Pieter Potter almost a hundred years earlier. Under the leadership of a certain Jacobus du Toit, the farmers of the area pushed through a route on the right bank or the eastern side of the Klein Berg River. Following the course of the river, the route had no steep gradients and soon became the preferred way to the Roodezand settlement, so that by the 1760s it too was known as the Roodezand Pass. To avoid confusion the original pass came to be called the Oude Roodezand Kloof, and the new one alongside the River duly became the Nieuwe Roodezand Kloof, names soon shortened to Oudekloof and Nieuwekloof. The easier access led to the valley's being used not only for stock farming, but also for the cultivation of vineyards, fruit and vegetables.http://namibsands.wordpress.com/2010/03/08/the-long-way-home-via- five-mountain-passes-a-weekend-in-the-olifants-river-mountains-part-v/ The Swedish botanist, Carl Thunberg, travelled through the kloof in 1772 on his way from Saldanha Bay, and noted that it was \\"one of the few chasms left by the long range of mountains through which it is possible for a wagon to pass\\" and that in some places it was too narrow for two wagons to pass each other. The intrepid naturalist, William Burchell, went through in 1811 and recorded it as In 1805 the growing village of Roodezand was renamed 'Tulbagh' and a landdrost was stationed there. Travellers and residents took to referring to Nieuwekloof as 'Tulbagh Kloof', and the name persisted. A tollgate was installed on the road in 1807 and Theal the historian noted the tariffs as \\"a chaise 4 shillings, a loaded wagon 4 shillings, unloaded wagon 2 shillings, cart 2 shillings, saddle horse 1 shilling, 20 oxen or cows 4 shillings, 100 sheep 4 shillings\\". At about this time Charles Michell began looking into ways by which the road through the kloof could be upgraded. The redoubtable pass builder, Thomas Bain, reconnoitred the kloof in 1855 and suggested a new route along the western side or left bank of the Klein Berg River, a recommendation which was followed in 1859 and 1860, and was to carry traffic for the next hundred years. A railway line was added to the left bank between the years 1873 and 1874. When an increase in traffic volume demanded a new route, construction returned to the right bank and a modern road was opened in 1968.

Brocavum is the Latin name of a Roman fort at Brougham near Penrith, Cumbria. The fort survives as earthworks, but no excavation of these has been carried out so far. Location and date With the rivers Eamont and Lowther flowing nearby and meeting to the west, the site had natural defences. As well as two rivers, three Roman roads intersected at the fort: the York - Scotch Corner - Stainmore Pass - Brough under Stainmore - Kirkby Thore - Brougham route (along the present A66); the Manchester/Lancaster - Burrow-in-Lonsdale - Middleton - Low Borrow Bridge (Tebay) - Brougham route (along the present West Coast rail line); and the Glannaventa (Ravenglass) Roman port - Hardknott - Galava (Ambleside) - High Street - Brougham route. From Brocavum (Brougham), the road went north to Luguvallium (Carlisle) via Old Penrith (along the present A6). From late Flavian times (80sAD) onwards, there may also have been a road from Old Penrith and/or Brocavum westwards to Troutbeck, to an undiscovered fort at Keswick, to the fort at Papcastle, and on to Alauna (Maryport). There was also a civilian settlement (part of which was excavated in 2008 during construction of a pipeline from Hackthorpe to Penrith), and a cemetery (excavated in the 1960s), the evidence from the latter suggesting that an East European (Danubian) contingent of people lived there. Six dedications to the local deity Belatucadrus were discovered at Brougham, suggesting perhaps \\"that his worship was centred there\\". It has been suggested that the focus of the Carvetii, a pre-Roman and Roman 'tribe' may have been nearby at Clifton Dykes. This may have been an additional factor, to the road and river ones mentioned above, in the positioning of the fort after the Roman conquest. Banks of Brocavum Roman fort in foreground, Brougham Castle behind, and 18th-century Carleton Hall to the left The dating of the fort is uncertain, but an important role from an early date is thought to be likely. The foundation date may be just after the revolt of Venutius in the early A.D.70s. An early-Flavian occupation is probable, even though the artefacts found in the excavation of the cemetery were from the second and third centuries A.D.Shotter, 2004, p.62 Access and conservation The medieval Brougham Castle now occupies part of the site, which is in the care of English Heritage. It is known that stones from the Roman fort were used in the construction of the castle, as a Roman tombstone can be seen in a passageway in the keep, used as a ceiling slab.

Consortiums and Conferences=EACLE= The European-American Consortium for Legal Education (EACLE), founded in 2000, educates future educators and lawyers for transnational challenges, by giving them transnational experiences as part of their legal studies. Five European and five United States law schools are in partnership to exchange students, faculty, scholarship, and experience, so that law students will have a broader understanding of the interrelated legal world in which they will practice their profession. The ten partners are American University, the University of Baltimore, Erasmus University Rotterdam, the University of Georgia, the University of Ghent, Helsinki University, Hofstra University, the University of Parma, Santa Clara University and Warsaw University. The primary activities of the EACLE consortium have been: * the exchange of faculty every fall for week- or semester-long visits; * the exchange of students during the spring semester; * an annual conference in May; and * the publication of the conference proceedings the following fall. Each year different European and American schools are paired, following a three-year scheduled rotation, to make the primary exchanges of one faculty member and two students. Other exchanges take place each year by agreement between the schools involved. The consortium is currently inactive. =IVR= The International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy (IVR) was founded in Berlin on October 1, 1909. The purpose of the Association is the cultivation and promotion of legal and social philosophy at both the national and the international level. The Association is open to all relevant scholarly disciplines. The Association, as well as its national sections, shall organize congresses, lectures and other events of a similar nature. The national sections are autonomous with respect to the organization of their events and also solely responsible for their financial affairs. The Center had a pivotal role in the organization of the 2015 World Congress in Washington, DC. Sister Schools The University of Baltimore School of Law has 19 foreign partners with whom the law school exchanges faculty and students and cooperates in research and publications. University of Baltimore students may also have an opportunity to spend a semester abroad at other overseas institutions by special arrangement with the University of Baltimore School of Law.

As the first Turkish woman with a degree from Sorbonne University, she occupied academic positions at various Turkish universities during her career and published numerous articles, mostly on metaphosphates and Turkish herbs. She is considered to be one of the first modern women scientists of Turkey. Early years She was born 1902 in Üsküp, then part of the Ottoman Empire, where her father Salih Hulusi was appointed as a civil servant. Her mother was Ayşe Refia. One year after the proclamation of the Second Constitution, the family returned to Istanbul in 1909. She was enrolled in a primary school while her grandmother hosted the family in her house. Remziye finished the 3-grade school in one year only earning her first diploma. With the appointment of her father to another place in Istanbul, the family moved again and she was schooled for the secondary education at different places on both sides of Bosporus. She then followed her teacher, who was appointed to the Girls' Teachers High School (). She studied five years at the boarding school in Çapa, Fatih including the two additional years, which enabled study at a higher educational institution. Remziye was educated in natural science at \\"Darülfünun\\" (forerunner of today's Istanbul University), where her primary interest was in chemistry. She graduated with honors on July 15, 1919. Right after graduation, she joined a small group of her female schoolmates to go to Baku, Azerbaijan to serve there at a teacher's college. The group sailed to Batumi, and took a three-day train ride to Baku. During a dinner in Baku, given by a wealthy Azeri, Remziye met Reşit Süreyya (later surnamed Gürsey), a medicine doctor from Turkey. The couple engaged on March 18, 1920 and married one month later on April 20. Very soon after, she and her husband left Azerbaijan, which got invaded by the Soviet Army, and returned to Istanbul. On April 7, 1921, she gave birth to her son Feza (Gürsey), who later became a notable mathematician and physicist. She received a call from her former teacher, who in the meantime had become a director of education in the ministry, to go to Adana for serving there as a teacher. Remziye went there by sea via Mersin after leaving her one-and-half years old son to her mother and elder sister in İstanbul. She taught mathematics at a two-class school. After one year, she followed her husband to Paris, France to complete her higher education. In 1924, her daughter Deha (Gürsey Owens) was born in Paris, who became later the Turkish member of International Psychology Association. There, she was educated in chemistry at Sorbonne University, also being a student of Marie Curie. During this time, she received a scholarship from the Turkish government, and her son was with her sister in Paris. Remziye earned a certificate in biochemistry. She was the first Turkish woman to earned a certificate in Sorbonne. Although she wanted to conduct doctoral studies, she had to return home due to omission of her scholarship with the completion of her education. Career Arrived in Istanbul, she was appointed administrative staff at Erenköy Girls High School. Remziye did not like the post because she wanted to teach chemistry. Her application to study for her PhD degree on scholarship in Paris was initially rejected. So, she applied for a vacant chemistry teacher's position at the Mining Engineering School in Zonguldak. Thereupon, Minister of Education Cemal Hüsnü (Taray) offered her a scholarship for doctoral studies in France, and her son Feza's entry into the renowned Galatasaray High School as a free-of-charge boarding student. In 1930, the couple divorced. She took her daughter Deha and her younger sister Mihri along with her to Paris, where the sister cared for the daughter. She conducted research on Metaphosphate by Paul Pascal (1880-1968) receiving her PhD title three years later with honors. In 1933, Remziye returned home. She was appointed associate professor of general chemistry and physical chemistry at Istanbul University, which had recently underwent an organizational reformation. In 1936, she moved Ankara to take the post of a specialist for biochemistry at the Pharmacodynamics Department of Public Health Institute. In 1947, Remziye, who had adopted the surname Hisar following the commencement of the 1934 Surname Law in 1934, went to Istanbul Technical University to take again the post of associate professor in chemistry at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Chemistry. She was promoted to full professor in 1959. In 1973, she retired. She published more than 20 articles during her career, mostly about metaphosphates and Turkish herbs, many of which were published in Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France. Later years After her retirement, Remziye Hisar lived in her house at Anadoluhisarı inherited from her father. She died soon after hearing the death of her son Feza in 1992. Recognition In 1991, she was rewarded by Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK).

Also can be recharged physically using conventional wired power adapter or USB cable. Uses a 2000 mAh capacity battery just as the larger Lumia 920 does and as a result has a longer battery life. Software This is the first Nokia phone to replace Nokia Maps with the Here suite of navigation services such as Here Maps, Here Transit and HERE Drive, but it lacks HERE Drive+ unlike other second generation Lumia devices.

Beginning in Fallujah, the protests afterwards spread throughout Sunni Arab parts of Iraq. The protests centered on the issue of the alleged sectarianism of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Pro-Maliki protests also took place throughout central and southern Iraq, where there is a Shia Arab majority. In April 2013, sectarian violence escalated after the 2013 Hawija clashes. The protests continued throughout 2013, and in December Maliki used security forces to forcefully close down the main protest camp, in Ramadi and killing hundreds of civilian protesters in the process. Sunni groups, such as the Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order, took up arms in response, and joined forces with the General Military Council for Iraqi Revolutionaries (GMCIR), a militant group made up of former Ba'athists, to conduct a military campaign against the Iraqi government. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) would later grow out of this civil conflict. Background Iraqi Sunni minority traditionally held power in Iraq, but the Sunni-dominated Ba'ath party was overthrown by the United States Armed Forces during the 2003 invasion, and Shia majority gained power. The majority of Iraqis are Shiites. Unlike the protests in 2011, which revolved around issues of corruption and national security, the new protests were driven by Sunni Arabs who felt marginalized in the post-Saddam Iraq, and who claimed that anti-terrorism laws were allegedly being abused and used to arrest and harass Sunnis. The growth of the protests, however, led the initial demands to be expanded, and eventually one of the main requests of the protesters was the resignation of Prime Minister Maliki. Other issues often cited were the alleged abuse of De- Baathification laws and unfair confiscation of property of former Baathists, and alleged Iranian interference in Iraqi affairs.Iraqi Speaker Comments On Protests, Syria – Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East Timeline=2012=December=21–27 December= The protests began on 21 December 2012 following a raid on the home of Sunni Finance Minister Rafi al- Issawi and the arrest of some of his bodyguards. Following the arrest several thousand protesters took to the streets of Fallujah following Friday prayers to condemn the arrests. The protesters blocked a highway in Fallujah and demanded Prime Minister Maliki's resignation, waving banners reading: \\"Resistance is still in our veins.\\" 23 December also saw protesters begin the barricading of the main highway at Ramadi, thereby disrupting a key Iraqi trade route to Jordan and Syria. The protests also spread from Al Anbar Governorate to other Sunni parts of Iraq including Mosul, Samarra Tikrit, and the Adhimiya district of Baghdad. As the protests in Anbar grew, delegations were sent to support to the protests from Baghdad and Saladin Governorate, with smaller delegations coming from the southern Iraqi governorates of Maysan and Basra. In order to try and prevent the further spread of the protests, the Iraqi Army established a cordon in Nineveh Governorate on 27 December. =28 December \\"Friday of Honour\\"= 28 December saw the protests increase in size, with tens of thousands taking part in the \\"Friday of Honour\\" protests against perceived government sectarianism. =29 December – 4 January = In their second week, the protests spread to Saladin and Diyala Governorates for the first time. During the week protests took place in Mosul, Kirkuk, Baiji, Tikrit, al-Daur, Ishaqi, Samarra, Jalawla, Dhuluiyah, Baquba, Ramadi, Fallujah, Baghdad, Albu Ajil, and Nasiriyah. The sit-in at Ramadi, blocking the highway, continued, and was visited from Amman by Sunni Iraqi Cleric Abdul Malik al-Saadi on 28 December. Tribal delegations traveled to Ramadi from Kirkuk, Karbala, and Muthanna, to support the protests. On 4 January the Baghdad Operations Command ordered the 6th Division to secure the Adhamiyah bridge to prevent sympathetic demonstrators from West Baghdad joining the anti-government demonstrations in the Adhamiyah district of East Baghdad. There were also reports of Iraqi Army units preventing delegations and media personnel from visiting Anbar from Baghdad. On 30 December Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni and critic of Maliki, travelled to Ramadi to attempt to address the protesters. Mutlaq's convoy was pelted with bottles and stones, and protesters chanted for him to leave, with some being angry that Mutlaq had taken a week to support the protesters, believing that he had come to undermine the protests. Bodyguards for Mutlaq wounded two people when they fired warning shots. Mutlaq's office described the incident as an attempted assassination by rogue elements. =2013=January=5–11 January= The week of 5 January saw continuing anti-government protests in Mosul, Kirkuk, Tikrit, al-Daur, Samarra, Dhuluiyah, Ramadi, Fallujah, Abu Ghraib, and the Baghdad districts of Adhamiya and Ghazaliyah. The week also saw the emergence of pro-government protests, taking place in Baghdad, along with the southern Shiite cities of Karbala, Kut, Najaf, Diwaniyah, Samawa, and Basra. The week also witnessed renewed government efforts to contain and deter protests, mostly through heightened security and deployments of military units. Pro-Maliki demonstrators in January 2012. Since the beginning of the protests, the Ninewa Operations Command of the Iraqi Army had been attempting to close Ahrar square, which was the site of the majority of anti-government protests in Mosul. Clashes between protesters and army units erupted on 7 January when army vehicles ran over several protesters, wounding 4, in an attempt to disperse the protester in the square. On 8 January four more protesters were wounded when Iraqi military units opened fire in the square. The clashes led to security for eastern Mosul being taken from the military and given to the Iraqi Federal Police 3rd Division. The Baghdad Operations Command also implemented a cordon in Al Tarmia, a town north of Baghdad, on 7 January in order to prevent protesters from blocking either highway leading north from Baghdad. The Baghdad to Mosul highway was eventually closed near Taji on January 11 by Iraqi army units. The Baghdad Operations Command deployed units on the eastern edge of Fallujah on 9 January. Security within the Adhamiya district of Baghdad was also tightened on 11 January in an effort to deter protests. The 11th Iraqi Army Division was deployed north of Tikrit by the Tigris Operations Command on January 11 to prevent protests in Hawija. In the west of Iraq units from the 29th Mechanised Brigade of the 7th Army Division closed the Jordan-Iraqi border crossing at Trebil due to unspecified security concerns. Thousands of pro-Maliki demonstrators took to the streets in at least 5 governorates on Tuesday 8 January to voice support for Maliki and oppose an attempts to change the de-Baathification laws. Protesters also voiced opposition to any return of the Baath party or the dividing of Iraq along sectarian or ethnic lines. Protests took place in Basra, Diwaniyah, Karbala, Al Muthanna and Babil Governorate. Anti-government demonstrators in Al Anbar Governorate in January 2012. =25 January \\"No Retreat Friday\\"= On 25 January, several protests were held across Anbar Governorate, with other protests also appearing in Samarra, Baqubah, Kirkuk, Mosul, Baghdad, and Hawija, as part of \\"No Retreat Friday.\\" The protests turned deadly in Fallujah, as soldiers opened fire on a crowd of rock-throwing demonstrators, killing 7 and injuring more than 70 others. Three soldiers were later shot to death in retaliation for the incident, and clashes erupted in Askari, on the eastern outskirts of Fallujah. Security forces were placed on high alert as a curfew and vehicle ban were brought into effect. In a statement, Maliki urged both sides to show restraint and blamed the incident on unruly protesters. He also warned that it could lead to a \\"rise in tension that al-Qaida and terrorist groups are trying to take advantage of\\". Thousands of people attended the funerals of the slain protesters on 26 January, some carrying Saddam-era Iraqi flags. The government responded to the shooting by pulling out most Army forces from the city and replacing them with federal police.Thousands of Iraqi Sunnis mourn protesters shot dead by troops (South China Morning Post) In a statement read at Fallujah's main square, Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha announced that the tribal leaders had given the government one week to bring the perpetrators of the shooting to justice. If this demand is not met, the Sheikh, who is the chairman of the Anbar Salvation Council, promised to \\"launch jihad against army units and posts in Anbar\\". February=22 February \\"'Iraq or Maliki\\"= On 22 February thousands of protesters took to the streets of Ramadi, Baghdad, Mosul, and Fallujah following Friday prayers in order to continue the demonstrations against the Iraqi government, calling for Maliki to step down. Anti-government demonstrators in Anbar Governorate in January 2012. The day also saw seven members of a Sahwa militia killed in Tuz Khormato by armed men wearing military uniforms. The assailants asked a local militia leader to accompany them to a checkpoint manned by a Sahwa militia, at which point the uniformed group overpowered the leader and members of the Sahwa militia before executing them. March=8–10 March= On 8 March police fired on Sunni demonstrators in Mosul, killing 1 protester and injuring 5 others. Police claimed that they fired into the air to disperse stone throwing protesters. In response to the shooting the Minister of Agriculture, Izz al-Din al-Dawla, hosted a televised news conference where he announced his resignation from his cabinet post to protest the killings. Dawla therefore became the second minister of resign as part of the protests, after Rafi al-Issawi. On 10 March Bunyan Sabar al-Obeidi, an anti-government protest organiser and spokesman for the Sunni protests in Kirkuk, was shot and killed whilst driving his car in Kirkuk in a drive-by shooting by unknown gunmen. Obeidi had escaped an assassination attempt the previous week. April=Sunni uprising and backlash= Following four months of protests, on Friday 19 April, an Iraqi officer was killed in clashes between security forces and protesters in Hawija, a town west of Kirkuk. Following the refusal of residents to hand over suspected perpetrators the security forces sought; Hawija was then put under siege. On the morning of 23 April, a security forces operation in Hawija resulted in the deaths of about 20 protesters and 3 Iraqi soldiers. Over a hundred people were injured.Rayburn 2013, pp. 237–38. The clashes erupted after security forces entered the area that was being used as a sit-in by Sunni protesters against the government. Sheikh Abdullah Sami al-Asi, a Sunni provincial official, said the violence resulted from the security forces entering the area and trying to make arrests. There was also retaliatory violence in the surrounding Sunni-majority region where other gunmen attacked police checkpoints in Riyadh and Rashad until a military counterattack a few hours later. On the same day, at least 21 others were killed as they left Sunni mosques in Baghdad and Diyala. Following the raid, Sunni tribal leaders called for a revolt. The next day revenge attacks continued against the police action. The north of the country featured more violence between security forces and protesters. In Sulaiman Bek, north of Baghdad, gunmen killed five soldiers and wounded five of their colleagues, while gunmen attacked a Sahwa militia checkpoint in Khales and killed four of the militiamen and wounding another person. Total deaths over the two days are believed to be over 100. The Iraqi government also set up a commission to investigate the previous day's incidents, that is to be led by Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq. On 25 April, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki warned of a sectarian war and blamed \\"remnants of Baath Party for violence.\\" Following the clashes in Suleiman Bek the Iraqi Army withdrew from the town, with an officer claiming the move was to allow for civilians to leave the town before the army began a counter-offensive. However, clashes and protests continued across the country with renewed protests by Sunni Arabs calling for the prime minister's resignation and an end to alleged discrimination against them. Violence also continued with the death toll reaching 200 after five days. The violence also included attacks on Sunni mosques. Sunni Arabs formed the Army of Pride and Dignity as the sectarian clashes escalated. On 27 April, the Iraqi government banned 10 satellite channels, including Al Jazeera and Iraq's Al Sharqiya. Mujahid Abu al-Hail of the Communications and Media Commission said: \\"We took a decision to suspend the licence of some satellite channels that adopted language encouraging violence and sectarianism. It means stopping their work in Iraq and their activities, so they cannot cover events in Iraq or move around.\\" Two days later, five car bombs blew up in Shia-majority areas. In Amara town in Maysan Governorate killing 15 people and wounding 45 others; in Al Diwaniyah a bomb exploded near a restaurant, killing three people and wounding 25 others; while in Karbala a car bomb explosion killed three civilians and wounded 12 others; and another car bomb exploded in the Shia- majority neighbourhood of the Sunni-majority town of Mahmoudiya killing three people and wounding 15 others. The same day, the Iraqiya's Sunni Arab Speaker of Parliament Osama al-Nujaifi called for the resignation of the government to be replaced by a smaller cabinet of independents, who would not compete in the next election, and for the electoral commission to prepare for an early national election with parliament to be dissolved. On 1 May, more attacks took place against a Sunni group of fighters backed by the government and in a Shia area. May On 17 May, at least 72 deaths were reported in several cities, including the capital, on Sunni targets. Attacks continued the next day, amid warning of a civil war after four days of violence resulted in over 140 deaths. On 20 May, bombs in Baghdad and Basra targeting Shias resulted in at least 68 deaths. It also hit Sunni areas such as Samarra. Following a previous week attack on alcohol shops that killed 12 people, the mixed Sunni- Shia area of Zayhouna in Baghdad was attacked again, resulting in the deaths of seven women and five men. On 27 May, over 50 deaths were reported in Shia areas of Baghdad. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki later vowed to hunt down the outlaws. On 31 May, following Friday prayers, a bomb exploded outside Baghdad's Sunni Omar mosque killing four people and wounding 11 other worshippers. The UN also noted the death toll for the month of May being the highest in five years with Al Jazeera attributing it to increased sectarianism. Additionally, the government banned cars with common temporary licence plates to try and avoid car bombings. June–November Following the April Hawija clashes, the number of protesters diminished, and sectarian violence increased. In July however, as Ramadan began, the protests intensified for a time. Provincial elections took place in Anbar in June 2013, and afterwards the new governor, Ahmad Khalaf al-Dhiyabi of the Muttahidoon coalition, began seeking ways to reconcile with Maliki. With the approval of protesters, Dhiyabi began negotiations with the Maliki government on 7 October. On 25 November, Dhiyabi led a delegation to meat with Maliki in Baghdad once again. Maliki agreed to many of the protesters' demands, but reiterated that the protests should be stopped. December By late December Prime Minister Maliki was claiming that the Ramadi protest camp had been turned into a headquarters for the leadership of al-Qaeda. Simultaneously the Iraqi army was conducting an offensive in Al Anbar Governorate against al- Qaeda. On Saturday 28 December MP Ahmed al-Alwani was arrested in a raid on his home in Ramadi. During the raid Alwani's brother, as well as 5 of his guards were killed. Eight other guards were wounded, whilst 10 members of the security forces were also wounded. Alwani was a prominent supporter of an anti-government protest camp situated on a highway near Ramadi. Reacting to his arrest, influential Sunni cleric Sheik Abdul Malik Al-Saadi urged Sunni protesters to defend themselves. The following evening, on Sunday 29 December, an Iraqi defense ministry spokesperson claimed on state TV that local Sunni leaders and clerics had agreed to peacefully end the 12 month sit in at the Ramadi protest camp after the Iraqi government had warned them that the camp was a potential shelter for al-Qaeda. The following day Iraqi security forces dismantled the Ramadi protest camp, however police special forces units claimed they came under fire when trying to enter the camp. At least ten people were killed and a number of police vehicles were attacked and burned, whilst Iraqi government helicopters supported security forces moving in on the camp. Loudspeakers from some Mosques in Ramadi reportedly exhorted people to \\"go to jihad.\\" A doctor at Ramadi hospital claimed that 10 gunmen had been killed and 30 wounded, whilst 3 policemen were killed and some four police vehicles destroyed. Several hours later, in reaction to the violence in Ramadi, some 40 Sunni MP's offered their resignations. The MP's demanded the withdrawal of the army from Ramadi and the release of Ahmed al-Alwani. The MP's resignations however will not have effect unless accepted by the parliaments speaker, Usama al-Nujayfi. Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq called for all politicians from the Iraqi National Movement to withdraw from the political process, which he claimed had hit a \\"dead end.\\" Sheik Abdul Malik Al-Saadi denounced the move against the protest camp, and called on security forces to immediately withdraw in order to avert further bloodshed. Saadi also called the Maliki led Iraqi government a \\"sectarian government that wants to smash and eradicate the Sunni people in its country,\\" and urged on Sunni politicians to resign from their posts and abstain from the political process. Aftermath Following the December 2013 clashes, ISIL launched a campaign in Anbar, taking control of Fallujah and temporarily occupying parts of Ramadi. Tribal militias fought alongside ISIL, and according to Sheikh Ali Hatem al- Suleiman of the Dulaim tribe, ISIL constituted only 5–7% of the anti- government forces. Fighting continued in 2014 and by June, a civil war was underway in Iraq, with ISIL controlling at least 70% of Anbar Province, including the city of Al Qaim. Responses=Domestic=Government The Iraqi government took steps to appease the protesters. On 29 January 2013 the Iraqi government announced that it would raise the salaries of Sahwa militia members by two-thirds, due to higher wages for Sahwa militia members, along with their incorporation into the security services and civil service being one of the demands of the protest movement. In February 2013 Deputy Prime Minister Hussein al-Shahristani's announced that 3,000 prisoners had been released over the past month and that all female prisoners had been transferred to prisons in their home provinces. Shahristani had previously publicly apologised in January 2013 for holding detainees without charge. Opposition groups * Sadrist Movement – On 1 January 2013, Shiite cleric and politician Muqtada al-Sadr came out in favour of the protests and blamed Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for the unrest in Iraq. In a warning to Maliki, Sadr stated: \\"The Iraqi spring is coming.\\" Sadr even expressed his willingness to travel to Al Anbar Governorate to join in the protests, but stated that his support was conditional on the protests remaining peaceful and did not seek to promote sectarian divisions. Sadr later made a rare television appearance where he prayed alongside Sunni clerics in a landmark Sunni mosque in Baghdad. Sadr however has been criticised due to his previous support for militias and engagement in violence against Sunni's during the Iraq War. * Ba'ath Party – On 5 January 2013, a 53-minute video was released on YouTube in which Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri, Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, stated his support for and encouraged the protests, saying that \\"the people of Iraq and all its nationalist and Islamic forces support you until the realization of your just demands for the fall of the Safavid-Persian alliance\\". =International= * – Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal warned that the Iraqi government needed to address the issue of sectarian extremism in order to restore peace, on January 5 at a press conference in Riyadh.

The guided busway and bus rapid transit (BRT) scheme promoted by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) opened on 3 April 2016. Built by Balfour Beatty at a total cost of £122 million to improve links from former coalfield towns into Manchester city centre, the busway proposal encountered much opposition and a public enquiry in 2002 before construction finally started in 2013. A branch route from Atherton, and an extension to the Manchester Royal Infirmary have been added to the planned original scheme. Twenty-five purple-liveried Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 bodied Volvo B5LH hybrid double-decker equipped with CCTV and next stop audio and visual announcements operate the service. Stops on the guided busway section have level-boarding from platforms equipped with passenger information display screens. From Leigh, the V1 limited-stop bus service joins seven kilometres of guided busway to Ellenbrook, six kilometres of bus lanes on the East Lancashire Road and sections of reserved bus lanes through Salford and Manchester city centres. The V2 service from Atherton to Manchester joins the guided busway at Tyldesley. Both services run via the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University before terminating at Manchester Royal Infirmary. Background Leigh, one of the largest towns in Britain without a railway station after the closure of the Tyldesley Loopline in 1969, suffered from poor transport connections to neighbouring towns. A guided busway scheme using a kerbed concrete track was proposed and constructed using the former railway trackbed from Leigh to Ellenbrook to improve access to Manchester city centre from Leigh, Tyldesley and Ellenbrook and regenerate areas of the former Lancashire Coalfield. When proposed, the busway was controversial and encountered much local opposition. It was branded the 'Misguided Busway' by a Salford councillor. Critics contested claims by TfGM that the creation of within-carriageway bus lanes would not reduce general traffic capacity along the East Lancashire Road, a heavily congested radial route for traffic heading towards Manchester and Salford city centres; but instead increase it. Route Cooling Lane stop on guided section and multi-user path The BRT route begins at Leigh bus station, and joins the guided section at East Bond Street. It proceeds through Leigh and along the converted rail alignment via Tyldesley to Newearth Road in Ellenbrook. An improved bus route from Atherton joins the route at Astley Street, Tyldesley. From Ellenbrook the route continues via bus lanes alongside the A580 East Lancashire Road, serving Worsley and Swinton before joining the A6 at Irlams o' th' Height. All stops along the A580 bus lanes are bus bays so that conventional stopping services can be overtaken by limited-stop expresses. It passes the University of Salford/Salford Crescent railway station before continuing through Manchester city centre and along bus-only lanes on Oxford Road to Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester University and the Central Manchester Hospitals. Buses use Bolton Road in Salford when Broad Street is congested. The guided section has stops at East Bond Street, Holden Road in Leigh and Cooling Lane between Higher Folds and Squires Lane in Tyldesley, Astley Street, Hough Lane and Sale Lane in Tyldesley and Newearth Road in Ellenbrook. The multi-user path for walkers, horse riders and cyclists alongside the guided section provides access for emergency vehicles and maintenance. For cyclists the path from Tyldesley to Ellenbrook is part of the National Cycle Network Route 55. The route from Leigh to Central Manchester Hospitals has 36 stops and the connecting route from Tyldesley to Atherton has five. Park and ride facilities are provided at East Bond Street, Astley Street and Wardley (where the A580 road passes under the M60 motorway).Manchester Confidential Services First Greater Manchester runs the service under a 10 year contract from TfGM, branded Vantage. Service V1 operates from Leigh and V2 from Atherton; with additional V4 services from Ellenbrook in the weekday morning peak period that does not use the guided section of the route. Timetabled journey times are 55 minutes from Leigh and Atherton to Albert Square, Manchester at peak periods; 45 minutes daytime off-peak and 40 minutes in evenings and early mornings. In daytime operation from Monday to Saturday at least eight buses per hour run in each direction on the guided section, four on the Leigh to Tyldesley section and four from Atherton joining the Tyldesley to Ellenbrook section. The earliest weekday departures from Leigh/Atherton are at 04:00/04:29 respectively; and last trips from Manchester Royal Infirmary at 24:00/23:45. Two additional V1 services run from Leigh into Manchester in the weekday morning peak; three additional services return to Leigh in the weekday evening peak. Four further additional V4 services run into Manchester in the morning peak, starting from Ellenbrook The introduction of the Vantage services resulted in the withdrawal of a number of services by operator First. Others were amended to join the A580 bus lanes east of Boothstown. The services were amongst those set to transfer to Go North West when it took over First's Cheetham Hill depot in 2019,Go-Ahead agrees Manchester deal Buses issue 769 April 2019 page 6 but it was later announced that First will continue to operate the service. =Operation= Vantage bus on the guided busway St Peter's Square in Manchester city centre After light-controlled junctions along the East Lancashire Road were upgraded with SCOOT adaptive signalling in July 2016, TfGM reported in the October that traffic journey times on this section had returned to pre-construction levels in the morning peak while accommodating significant additional traffic. In the first six months of operation, more than 900,000 passenger journeys were made. A survey of users published in October 2016 revealed that 20% of passengers had switched from using their cars for the same journey, and nearly all respondents would recommend the service. More than a quarter of busway users walked or travelled more than a kilometre to reach the busway. By the third year of operation, it was being estimated that 580,000 car trips per year along the BRT route had transferred to bus ridership. The service attracted about 28,000 passengers per week when it started in April 2016 rising to 45,000 by the autumn and 55,000 in the run up to Christmas 2016. In the first year more than 2.1 million passengers were carried; increasing to approximately 2.6 million in the second, and 3 million in the third. By December 2017, weekly ridership had increased to 62,000. This has further increase a record 62,700 passengers in September 2018. =Buses= Services were initially operated by 20 Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 bodied Volvo B5LH hybrid double-decker buses in purple-livery. They are equipped with CCTV and next stop audio and visual announcements, USB charging points and free Wi-Fi. Five more buses were purchased in January 2017 to provide extra capacity at busy times and facilitate the extended service to Central Manchester Hospitals. It is required that buses that operate the busway service are replaced after 5 years of service. Further buses are scheduled to enter service in September 2018. These will operate the V4 service from Ellenbrook, and will be standard vehicles not adapted for busway running.\\"Vantage Busway gains extra buses from September\\" Coach & Bus Week issue 1354 7 August 2018 page 13 In February 2019, TfGM were successful in bidding for funding support in buying an additional 10 electric buses for busway operation, to enter service in March 2020. These will be Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMC double-deckers with BYD Company battery power. TfGM intend that eventually all Vantage services will be operated by electric buses; to be purchased and owned by TfGM themselves, rather than by the service operator. Five of the existing fleet of Volvo B5LH buses will be transferred to other services in Greater Manchester; and so total fleet will increase to 30, allowing increased daytime frequency on V1 services from Leigh. = Stops, signalling and ticketing = Stops along the guided busway section provide level-boarding from platforms and are equipped with passenger information display screens. The guided busway crosses local roads on level, light-controlled junctions at which busway services have priority. Standard First Greater Manchester fares include travel on Vantage services. Awards The scheme won the Transport Policy, Planning and Implementation award at the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport North West Awards and the award for sustainability at the 10th annual North West Construction Awards in 2016. The launch of the Vantage service won the Transport Project of the Year category and the Leigh to Ellenbrook Guided Busway section was the winner in the Construction and Engineering category at the National and the North of England Transport Awards in December 2016. Greater Manchester's Bus Priority Package won the National Transport Award for improvements to bus services in October 2017. History=Planning= A long legal process preceded the busway's construction, including a public inquiry in 2002. The decision of the public inquiry was delayed because of great crested newts occupying a site on the route. The Department for Transport granted powers to build the busway in 2005 and it was projected to be built by 2009 but preliminary work only started in 2012. Powers to build it are set out in the Greater Manchester (Leigh Busway) Order 2005 in the Transport and Works Act. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive estimated in 2005 that the busway would generate around 2 million passenger trips per annum. After the public inquiry, a branch bus route from Atherton to Tyldesley and an extension from Manchester city centre to the Manchester Royal Infirmary were added to the scheme. =Construction= The guided busway under construction at Cooling Lane, Tyldesley in January 2016 Site clearance for the dedicated busway section between Leigh and Ellenbrook took place between November 2012 and March 2013. Balfour Beatty began its construction in September 2013. A short section of the busway west of Newearth Road was completed in early 2015 and in the April was used for a trial of the construction method and the bus guidance system. Following delays due to bad weather and other problems, the busway works were rescheduled to be completed before the end of 2015. The service began on 3 April 2016 to coordinate with associated road and tram works in Manchester city centre.TfGM http://www.tfgm.com/buspriority/Pages/website/pdfs/Letter-110116.pdf TfGM spent £122 million on bus priority investment of which the guided busway track and infrastructure cost £68 million and the rest was spent upgrading associated local roads, bus lanes and junctions. The Greater Manchester Transport Fund provided most of the funding and the Department for Transport contributed £32.5 million.

He was the fourth son of Archambaud de Grailly, captal de Buch and Isabella, Countess of Foix.  Biography  He was knighted in 1413 and became a member of the entourage of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. For his loyalty, King Charles VI of France, allied with Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy, gave him Narbonne, of which he couldn't take possession, because it was under control of Dauphin Charles, then at war with his father and Burgundy. At that time, he married Marguerite de Comminges, twenty years older than him, an authoritarian woman who allegedly had her second husband killed in prison. Fearing a similar fate, Mathieu had his wife locked up a few months later in the castle of Bramevaque and governed Comminges alone. Following his brother, he defected from the Burgundian camp to King Charles VII of France, who rewarded him by making him governor of the Dauphiné between 1426 and 1428. After the death of his brother John I, Count of Foix, Matthieu became regent of his nephew Gaston IV and in 1439 he bought off Rodrigo de Villandrando and his raiders to leave the County of Foix. Meanwhile, the unsatisfied people of Comminges petitioned the return of their Countess Marguerite from King Charles VII, who ordered her release. Mathieu refused and transferred his wife to Foix. Again allied with Burgundy, he became a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1440. Charles VII put the County of Comminges under guardianship of John IV, Count of Armagnac and in 1441 war broke out between Foix and Armagnac, only interrupted in 1442 by a campaign against the English. After this campaign, Charles VII again ordered the liberation of Marguerite on 17 January 1443 and now, Mathieu was forced to obey. Marguerite was released on 9 March but died shortly after, leaving Comminges to the Crown. In 1449 Mathieu accompanied Gaston IV to besiege Mauléon. He died 4 years later.

By Karel Klíč, 1869. Felicita Vestvali (born February 23, 1831, in Stettin; died April 3, 1880, in Warsaw), also known as Felicità von Vestvali, was an opera singer and actress famous in Europe and the United States. She was known in North America as \\"Vestvali the Magnificent\\" or \\"Magnificent Vestvali\\" and was praised by Abraham Lincoln and Napoleon III. Vestali was admired for her beauty and her contralto voice and for her independence from the norms of femininity at the time. She was a self-described \\"man-hater\\" (\\"Männerfeindin\\") and widely described as Uranian, with links to the feminist movement, the nascent movement for gay and lesbian rights, and to the movements for racial and religious emancipation.Vestvali, Felicità von. Pallas Athene: Memoiren einer Künstlerin. 1873.Louise Otto. Felicita von Vestvali. In: Neue Bahnen: Organ des allgemeinen deutschen Frauenvereins. 3. Bd.; Nr. 20 u. 21. 1868.Rosa von Braunschweig: Felicita von Vestvali. In: Magnus Hirschfeld (Hrsg.): Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen. 1903. Life Her family background is unclear. According to Ludwig Eisenberg, Vestvali came from an old noble family. Despite her Italian stage name, Vestvali was born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), as Anna Marie Stegemann. Her father, a senior civil servant, had adopted the name \\"Stegemann\\" for political reasons, and her mother was Baroness von Hünefeld. According to another source, her father belonged to the Polish noble family of Westfalowicz. Others indicate that she was born in 1834 as the daughter of a high Austrian official in Kraków.A. Diezmann (Hrsg.) : Felicita von Vestvali: in Allgemeine Moden-Zeitung, 70. Jg. 1868, Nr. 47, S. 744. Vestvali's family refused her a theater training, so in 1846 at the age of 15 she ran away from home in boy's clothes and joined the impresario Wilhelm Bröckelmann and his theater company in Leipzig. With Bröckelmann's group, Vestvali undertook a long tour to various northern German city theaters. Back in Leipzig, she was discovered by actress Wilhelmine Schröder- Devrient and accepted as a student. With her support, Vestvali was able to make her debut there at the Altes Theater in the role of Agathe in Der Freischütz. After a short guest appearance at the Hanover Opera House, Vestvali went to France to the Conservatoire de Paris. This was followed by a concert tour as a soloist. In the winter of 1855/56, she was a student with Romani in Florence and Saverio Mercadante in Naples. During this time she took the stage name Felicita Vestvali and sang as a supposedly Italian singer in La Scala in her first travesti role of Romeo. This was followed by successes in Paris, London, New York and Mexico City. After that, she had planned a long vacation in Italy, but Emperor Napoleon III brought her back to the Paris Opera. He was so captivated with her that he presented her with a solid silver suit of armor for her performance as Romeo in Bellini's Romeo and Juliet. The audience celebrated her performances enthusiastically and the critics compared her to Maria Malibran, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient and Rachel Félix. With a French opera company she made a tour through France, Belgium and Holland and in 1862 another tour to New York followed. There she worked with colleagues like Charles Kean. In the United States, Vestvali was the first female Hamlet actress ever (in travesti). From this time on, she was also called \\"the female Kean\\". Karl Gutzkow suggested her in the preface to his play Richard Savage as a candidate for the leading role. After bad reviews of her appearance in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice in San Francisco in 1865, she switched from musical theater to speaking roles. She returned to Europe and was again successful. She appeared as Romeo and Hamlet in Shakespeare's dramas. She played these roles in 1867 in London's Lyceum Theatre in English. Queen Victoria attended a performance. The Royal Academy of Arts made her an honorary member. In the spring of 1868 Vestvali performed in Hamburg and Lübeck. Afterwards she went on a two-year tour through Europe. When the Franco-Prussian War ended in 1871, Vestvali rarely performed and retired more and more into private life. She spent the last years of her life in Bad Warmbrunn. During a visit to friends in Warsaw, she fell ill and died on April 3, 1880, six weeks after her 49th birthday. During her last illness, she was \\"nursed by a Miss G\\", as well as her \\"inseparable friend\\" and principal heir, the German actress Elise Lund, \\"who came to nurse her also\\" and later took Vestvali's body to Bad Warmbrunn.

The Mission olive has been included in the Ark of Taste, an international catalog of endangered heritage foods maintained by the Slow Food movement. It is also the only American olive cultivar listed by the International Olive Council in its World Catalogue of Olive Varieties. Although developed in the United States, Mission olives are also used by South African olive oil producers. Description Mission trees can reach heights of . They produce small fruit, typically of around . It has the lowest flesh-to-pit ratio (6.5:1) and greatest cold resistance of any commercial cultivar in California. Mission olives are harvested for table use from late October through November; for oil production, they are harvested between mid-December and February. They are susceptible to peacock spot, a disease caused by the fungus Cycloconium oleaginum, and olive knot, a disease caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas savastanoi. Uses Mission olives are one of five cultivars (along with Ascolano, Barouni, Manzanilla, and Sevillana) commercially viable in California for production as table olives. They have also been used in the production of olive oil since the days of the Spanish missions. Prevalence In 1992, the Mission cultivar represented just over eight percent of California's overall olive acreage. Mission olives were dominant until 1875, when Andalusian immigrants introduced the Manzanilla cultivar; subsequent introductions further reduced the percentage of Mission trees in California. After Manzanilla and Sevillana, however, it remains one of the more common cultivars in the state. The Oroville district in Butte County is a major Mission producer. Origin Olive trees were first brought to California by the Franciscan mission of San Diego de Alcalá; olive production likely began in earnest within the first two decades of the mission. The original trees suffered after the secularization of the missions, though pioneers cultivated new trees from their cuttings, leading to the distinct Mission cultivar. Though researchers at the University of Córdoba presumed the Mission olive to be of Spanish origin, they were unable to establish its relationship with any of 700 Spanish cultivars. Recent DNA testing in California suggests the Mission olive could be related to Picholine Marocaine, a Moroccan cultivar. Spanish settlers likely brought what would become the Mission trees to Mexico first.

It is based on an original screenplay by James Russo and a rewrite by David Grovic and Paul Conway and an inspiration of The Cat: A Tale of Feminine Redemption by Marie-Louise von Franz. The film stars John Cusack, Rebecca Da Costa, Crispin Glover, Dominic Purcell, and Robert De Niro. The film premiered on February 28, 2014, in New York and Los Angeles. Plot Brutal gangster Dragna recruits professional killer Jack to pick up a bag and wait for his arrival at a motel. Dragna stresses that Jack is not to open the bag or allow anyone to view its contents under any circumstances. Confused as to why Dragna wants him to do such an apparently easy job, Jack presses for more details, but Dragna only reiterates the rules. When Jack acquires the bag and a henchman of Dragna's shoots him in the hand, Jack kills him and stuffs the body in his car's trunk. Dragna is unsympathetic when Jack calls him and instructs Jack to stick to the plan. At the motel, Jack meets several people: Ned, the wheelchair-bound desk clerk; Rivka, a tall hooker; and Lizard and Guano, a pair of pimps. Jack requests room number thirteen, and Ned cautions him that it is a deathtrap, as it is unconnected. When two suited men become curious about Jack, he abruptly breaks into their room and kills both. A subsequent search reveals FBI badges and a briefcase. Jack sets the briefcase aside and leaves to dump the corpse stored in his car, but promptly returns upon being spotted, only to discover that Rivka has broken into his room. Fearful that Lizard will kill her, she requests that he allow her to stay. Jack initially demands that she leave, then detains her when he cannot be sure whether she opened the bag. Rivka points out that the briefcase contains a photo of the bag, and Jack becomes worried that others may attempt to acquire it. When Jack attempts to drive Rivka to a bus station, she spots the corpse in the back of his car. Lizard and Guano first question Jack about Rivka and later, on the road, attack him. On their corpses he finds another photo of the bag. Unsure what to do with Rivka, or of her involvement, he returns to the hotel with her to await Dragna's arrival. Ned becomes suspicious that Jack has a guest in his room and calls the sheriff when Jack refuses to pay the double occupancy fee. Sheriff Larson briefly questions Jack, and, after Larson leaves, Jack threatens Ned. Increasingly worried about the safety of the bag, Jack buries it near the motel, only to be caught by Ned, who is now out of his wheelchair. Jack kills Ned and returns to the motel, where Larson arrests him under suspicion of Ned's disappearance. As Larson prepares to torture Jack for information, Rivka shows up. Larson threatens to rape her, but she overpowers a deputy and frees Jack, who then kills Larson. When Rivka demonstrates detailed knowledge of the bag, Jack becomes suspicious of her again, but she points out that she has saved his life. Somewhat mollified, he retrieves the bag and waits in room fourteen. Dragna finally appears, disappointed in Jack's apparent lack of trust. Nonetheless satisfied that Jack has not looked in the bag, Dragna explains that the whole situation was a test of Jack's skills and character, as he doubted Jack's resolve in the wake of Jack's fiancee's unsolved murder some months earlier. The motel and the local cops are all on Dragna's payroll, and were all (unwittingly) part of the test. As Dragna prepares to leave, Rivka spontaneously tells Jack that she looked in the bag. Frustrated, Jack points out that Dragna will now kill them both. Jack dutifully reports Rivka's action to Dragna, who orders her killed. Jack instead kills Dragna's bodyguard, who wounds Rivka. Jack hunts down Dragna, and both are wounded. Jack looks in the bag and discovers the head of his fiancee, whom Dragna had killed in order to prevent Jack from quitting the murder-for-hire business. Trying to persuade Jack to surrender, Dragna destroys the hotel (where Rivka supposedly is) with remote-detonated explosives. Moments later, Rivka appears and saves Jack by killing Dragna, but she is shot again. Later, in Dragna's lawyer's office, Rivka reveals herself as Dragna's mistress and personal assassin who was sent to the motel to ensure things went Dragna's way. She collects a five million dollar reward for Jack's assassination, and she and Jack drive off together.

Metacritic rated it 28/100 based on 18 reviews. Scott Foundas of Variety called it \\"a tedious, self-consciously quirky postmodern noir\\". Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"If it weren't for the touches of cruelty, this might have been a passable B-movie, but Bag Man ends up wasting the A-list talent caught up in the lurid exercise.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the plot as \\"a protracted and increasingly tedious cat-and-mouse game\\" that \\"pathetically tries to build up expectations about what might be in the bag\\". Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club called it a Quentin Tarantino knock-off made two decades too late.

It has housed, and continues to house, Quaker meetings for worship for over 300 years. History William Penn planned two inland \\"New Towns\\" outside of his city of Philadelphia while working with Thomas Holme on the map of his province of Penn's sylvania. The town now known as Newtown Square was the \\"New Town\\" planned for Chester County, Pennsylvania, (the eastern portion of which was subsequently split off into a new Delaware County in 1789) with another \\"New Town\\" planned for Bucks County. Lots were sold to Welsh Quakers, who began arriving after 1681. These Welsh Quakers met for worship in local homes, before constructing a stone meeting house in 1711. This stone meeting house is still the meeting for worship for the Newtown Square Friends Meeting House, over 300 years later. The Meeting House is the oldest place of worship in Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. The Meeting House was greatly expanded and \\"modernized\\" in 1791. The architectural ghost of the original 1711 doorway and one of the original windows can be seen in the stone infill in the north wall of the expanded Meeting House. On the 100th anniversary of the first expansion, in 1891, the Meeting House was again \\"modernized\\" - with pine wainscoting, electricity, and a dividing wall that opens for worship and closes to divide the men's business meeting from the women's business meeting. The Quakers provided for the schooling of their children by subscription, prior to the passage of the laws requiring public schools in the 1830s. The property contained an early school in the 18th century, and then a stone octagonal school, one of four octagon schools built in the township, was built in 1815. In 1885, a three-story structure was built to serve as a boarding school at the property, with the girls on the second floor and the boys on the third floor. The boarding school remained open until 1912. The building remains in place, and has served various purposes since that time. An adjoining cemetery has been in use since about 1700. A stone wall was built around the cemetery in 1914 through the generosity of William Hood Dunwoody, who attended meeting here as a boy, and later helped found the company that became General Mills. By 1984 the membership of the meeting was reduced to 14 members, and the meeting began the process of being \\"laid down\\" or discontinued. Nevertheless, with the help of the Haverford Quarterly Meeting, the meeting continued operation. The Meeting House celebrated its 300th anniversary in 2011. It remains in use for worship on \\"First Day\\", Sundays, at 10:00 a.m. File:Newtown Square Meeting House DelCo PA 1.jpg|Burial ground File:Newtown Square Meeting House DelCo PA 3.jpg|Viewed from the west File:Newtown Square Meeting House DelCo PA 4.jpg|Viewed from the northwest File:Newtown Square Meeting House DelCo PA 5.jpg|Horse shed File:Newtown Square Meeting House DelCo PA 6.jpg|Viewed from the south ReferencesExternal links *Philadelphia Yearly Meeting entry Cemeteries in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Churches in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Quaker meeting houses in Pennsylvania 18th-century Quaker meeting houses 1711 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Newtown Square Friends Meeting House"},{"id":"38639094","text":"Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 262 (P.

The first level of the museum presents a collection of Gallo-Roman funerary steles as well as objects taken from various excavations in Haute-Saône (including those of an important villa from the 2nd century AD). The second level exhibits paintings and sculptures of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and especially the 18th and 19th centuries. The most significant holdings of the museum are paintings and sculptures by Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904), who was born in Vesoul. Gérôme donated a number of his works to the museum during his lifetime, and his heirs donated more works after his death. These range from the very early Saint Vincent de Paul of 1847 to the very late self-portrait of the artist painting his statue The Ball Player of 1902. As result, the museum's Gérôme collection, displayed in several rooms, is without equal. Displayed along with Gérôme are by works of artists of Haute-Saône whom he trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, beginning in 1864. These artists collectively became known as the École Haut-Saônoise, or School of Haute-Saône. They painted landscapes, scenes of country life, and portraits.

Through his work at a non-profit organization, he meets Travis Holloway (Richmond Arquette), and the two men form an unlikely friendship. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013, where it won the Audience Award for Best of NEXT. Plot Martin Bonner has just moved to Nevada from Maryland, leaving behind his two adult children and a life he spent more than two decades building. He is there working at a new job as the volunteer coordinator for a non-profit organization that helps prisoners make the transition from incarceration to freedom. It is Martin’s first job in two years and he has recently declared bankruptcy. At the same time, Travis Holloway, a prisoner in the program, is being released after serving twelve years. Sent back into the world with nothing, Travis also finds life in Reno difficult to adjust to, despite the help from his program sponsor, Steve Helms. The stories of Martin and Travis slowly converge, as the two men meet and find that they have much in common, not the least of which is an unspoken need for encouragement and support. Their unlikely friendship blossoms but is put to the test when Travis betrays Martin's trust in order to reunite with his estranged daughter.

Combining his playing career while working in a factory, Della Negra became active in the French Resistance in October 1942, and went into hiding in February 1943. Della Negra, a Communist, was a member of the Manouchian Group; he was wounded in an attack in November 1943, and he was executed by firing squad in February 1944. His execution, along with twenty two fellow résistants is the subject of the famous propaganda poster, l'\\"Affiche rouge\\". Before he died, Della Negra wrote a letter to his brother saying \\"hello and goodbye to Red Star.\\" His brother was present on 21 February 2004 as the club revealed a plaque in his honour.

It is monotypic, being represented by the single species Mussa angulosa, commonly known as the spiny or large flower coral. It is found on reefs in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas and the Gulf of Mexico. Description Mussa angulosa is a colonial species and the whole clump forms a low dome that may reach across. The corallites are phaceloid, that is they have a tubular form growing from a common base, in series of one to three, or occasionally up to five. The individual corallites are large, being in diameter and up to high. There are four cycles of septa in each corallite, nearly equal in size; they are narrow and curved, with wide spacing. The individual polyps are very large, sometimes reaching a length of and a diameter of . They completely obscure the short branches of the stony skeleton on which they occur. During the day the polyps appear fleshy, but during the night they expand further and each is fringed by a rim of short tentacles. The colour of the polyps is variable, being grey or pale brown with green, pink and purple shades. The tissues of this coral contain symbiotic single-celled algae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic and absorb energy from the sun to create organic compounds which are used by the coral. Distribution Mussa angulosa occurs in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas, and on reefs and banks off the coast of Texas and southern Florida. It is found in water between deep but most often between . Biology Mussa angulosa is a reef-building species and is aggressive, attacking other fast-growing corals that start to grow close by and threaten to overgrow it or shade it. Its cnidocytes are so powerful that no other Caribbean corals can successfully attack it. It leans away from the current as it grows and reacts adversely to increased sedimentation. Status There are no specific threats facing this coral and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being of \\"Least Concern\\". It is however probably declining because of the degradation of coral reefs by mechanical damage, climate change and ocean acidification. It is susceptible to coral bleaching and the coral diseases that affect stressed corals. Off the coasts of the United States it is present in various marine parks and other conservation areas, in both of which it is protected.

Located on the west side of the Odeonsplatz (Odeon Square), where it forms an ensemble with the Odeon, it currently houses the Bavarian State Ministry of Finance. It was once home to the Leuchtenberg Gallery on the first floor. History=Palace by Leo von Klenze= Leo von Klenze, builder of the original palace Eugène de Beauharnais, the brother-in-law of the later King Ludwig I of Bavaria and the stepson of Napoleon, commissioned Leo von Klenze to build a \\"suburban city palace\\". Constructed between 1817 and 1821 at a cost of 770,000 guilders (the entire construction budget for Bavaria in 1819), it was the largest palace of the era, with more than 250 rooms including a ballroom, a theatre, a billiard room, an art gallery, and a chapel, plus a number of outbuildings extending for over down what is now Kardinal-Döpfner- Straße.Das Palais Leuchtenberg, Bavarian State Ministry of Finance It was the first building on the Ludwigstraße. Klenze intended it to serve as a benchmark for the new boulevard. He chose the Italian neo-Renaissance style, modelling the building on the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. He placed eagles over the windows on the first floor as in one of Napoleon's palaces. He gave the building almost equally prominent façades on three sides, and a sufficiently adaptable interior layout for it to be repurposed in case Beauharnais was forced by Ludwig to leave Munich. It had two floors above the ground floor and each floor had 11 windows. Also notable was a small entrance porch or portico of Doric type with four columns. The concert hall or ball room was very large measuring 124 ft in length and 71 ft in width with a height of 50 ft. Depiction of the palace in 1852 Klenze also visited Paris during the construction phase to study the newly developed fosses inodores et mobiles (an early form of sanitary toilet), which he had installed in the palace and which soon became standard in almost all new buildings in Munich. Beauharnais lived in the palace with his wife Augusta, Ludwig's sister, and his children. On 2 August 1829 the proxy marriage of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil and Princess Amélie of Leuchtenberg took place in the chapel. Court festivities were a feature in the palace in view of its ballroom, art gallery and a private theater facilities. In 1852, after the death of Eugène de Beauharnais' widow Augusta, the palace was sold to Prince Luitpold, the later Prince Regent of Bavaria.,Das Palais Leuchtenberg: Vom Stadtpalais zum Finanzministerium, Bavarian State Ministry of Finance and until the Nazi seizure of power early in 1933, it was used by the Bavarian royal family, the House of Wittelsbach. Prince Ludwig, later Ludwig III, married Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este in 1868 and it was their first home. Their son Prince Rupprecht was born here in 1869 and was baptised in the palace chapel on May 20, 1869. After the end of the monarchy in Bavaria in 1918, the outbuildings were converted into shops and a garage. In 1923, the Bavarian Landtag approved the private ownership of the palace. Rupprecht, who had relocated here from the Palais Leutstetten with his son, Albrecht von Bayern, when they were challenged by Adolf Hitler as he came to power, lived there until 1939 in a small apartment, sometimes using the reception rooms for events. During the Second World War, the palace was badly damaged in air raids in 1943 and 1945. The Free State of Bavaria acquired the ruined building in 1957 and had it demolished. =Heid and Simm building= Courtyard In 1963-1967, a new building designed by Hans Heid and Franz Simm was built on the site for the Bavarian State Ministry of Finance. This building has a frame of reinforced concrete with brick facing. The façade is an accurate reconstruction of von Klenze's palace except for a new entrance on the east side; the main entrance was formerly on the south side. (The only actual old fabric retained is the west entrance.)Gavriel David Rosenfeld, Munich and Memory: Architecture, Monuments, and the Legacy of the Third Reich, Weimar and now 22, Berkeley: University of California, 2000, , p. 368, n. 7. However, the interior layout has not been reproduced, although the ministry reception rooms and the office of the State Minister of Finance are located on the first floor, the bel étage. What little survived of the ornate interior of the former building is now in Nymphenburg Palace. The Alexander frieze by Bertel Thorvaldsen survives only in a copy which is now in the foyer of the Herkulessaal (Hercules Hall), a post-war concert hall in the Residenz. In 1958 the architect and preservationist Erwin Schleich had suggested reconstructing the destroyed Odeon concert hall on the site of the Palais Leuchtenberg, since the concert hall could not be rebuilt on its original site. Although this plan had some support, it was not carried out.Rosenfeld, p. 190.

The facility was closed from 1946 until 1954, when production resumed until 1956, then closed again. In 1960, it was sold to the Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority (OOWA), which converted most of the facility to become the mid America Industrial Park. Background In July 1941, the War Department decided to build a munitions manufacturing facility between Chouteau and Pryor in Mayes County, Oklahoma. Site selection criteria included an ample supply of water and hydroelectric power, relatively level ground and an available local work force.

History=Initial phase= During the summer of 1941, the government began buying approximately of land for the facility. Concurrently, the duPont Company began designing the plant to produce smokeless powder. Although the project, now designated as the Oklahoma Ordnance Works (OOW), was originally estimated to cost $32 million, by September 1941, the estimate had risen to about $80 million. The plant started up in June 1942 and began actual production of smokeless powder in September. =Expansion= In January 1942, the government formed a War Production Board began to expand powder and munitions production plants. In March 1942, a TNT plant was constructed. Other production plants included those for nitric acid, sulfuric acid and tetryl. Production continued until the war ended in 1945. By the end of the war, the complex covered containing 487 buildings, 24 residences, of railroad track, and four complete water systems. Ultimately, the OOW produced more than of smokeless powder and of TNT and tetryl. Production ceased on August 16, 1945. =Prisoner of war camp= During autumn 1944, some vacant dormitories at the OOW complex were used to house German prisoners of war. They were separated from the rest of the complex by fenced perimeters patrolled by U. S. Army military police and manned guard towers. Some prisoners were allowed to perform farm work, escorted by armed guards, as allowed by the Geneva Convention. Apparently none worked in the OOW facilities. Prisoners were repatriated beginning in the fall of 1945.Bill Corbett, \\"Prisoner of War Camps.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved February 27, 2013. =Reactivation and disposition= The complex was put up for sale in 1946, but there were no bidders. The General Services Administration (GSA) sold the electric power and water plants to the state of Oklahoma. The Department of Defense (DOD), successor to the War Department, decided to keep the rest of the complex, then reactivated the plant for production from 1954 until 1956. GSA then offered the facility for lease in 1958. Instead, it was sold in 1960 to the State of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority (OOWA), a public trust, was formed in December 1960 to redevelop and administer twelve thousand acres of the complex into the mid America Industrial Park. Effect on Oklahoma economy OOW had a major impact on the economy of eastern Oklahoma. Most importantly, it was a source of employment for thousands of people. Other projects were begun to house the five to ten thousand workers who would be needed to build and operate the facility. The area enclosed by Chouteau, Pryor and Locust Grove, Oklahoma began to be known as the \\"Golden Triangle,\\" because of its sudden economic boom. A $500,000 sewer and water improvement project for Chouteau was funded by OOW. The United States Housing Authority built 500 homes for workers in Pryor, while the Home Owners Loan Corporation funded 335 more.

As per the CBI, this amounted to , transferred through bank accounts in the UK and UAE. It came to light in early 2013, when an Indian national parliamentary investigation began into allegations of bribery and corruption involving several senior officials and a helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland surrounding the purchase of a new fleet of helicopters. The scandal has been referred to as the Chopper scam or Choppergate by the media and popular press. Several Indian Congress politicians and military officials were accused of accepting bribes from AgustaWestland in order to win the Indian contract for the supply of 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters; these helicopters are intended to perform VVIP duties for the President of India and other important state officials.

The case continues to be investigated in India by the Indian government and the CBI. Overview The Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) signed a contract to purchase 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters in February 2010 for the Communication Squadron of Indian Air Force to carry the president, PM and other VVIPs. Controversy over the contract came to light on 12 February 2013 with the arrest of Giuseppe Orsi, the CEO of Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland's parent company by Italian authorities over corruption and bribery charges; the following day Indian Defence Minister A.K. Antony ordered a probe into the contract. Critical Events * On 25 March 2013, India's Defence Minister A.K. Antony confirmed corruption allegations by stating: \\"Yes, corruption has taken place in the helicopter deal and bribes have been taken. The CBI is pursuing the case very vigorously.\\" As of June 2014, the Indian government has recovered a total amount of and has recovered around (45% of the total contract value ) it had paid to AgustaWestland. * On 8 April 2016, the Milan Court of Appeal, in a 225-page judgement, overturned a lower court verdict and convicted helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland's executive Giuseppe Orsi to four years' imprisonment for paying a €30 million bribe to Indian politicians, bureaucrats and Indian Air Force officials. * On 9 December 2016, the CBI arrested former Indian Air Force Chief S.P.

Investigation  After a huge controversy and allegations of corruption, Defence Minister A.K. Antony, on 12 February, ordered an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On 25 February 2013, CBI registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against 11 persons including the former Indian Air Force Chief, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, and his cousins, besides four companies. After carrying out the preliminary enquiry, the CBI found sufficient evidence and registered an FIR on 13 March. The FIR named 13 persons including: former Indian Air Force Chief, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, his three brothers: Juli, Docsa and Sandeep, the brother of former Union minister Santosh Bagrodia, Satish Bagrodia, and Pratap Aggarwal (Chairman and Managing Director of IDS Infotech). The FIR also named four companies - Italy-based Finmeccanica, UK-based AgustaWestland and Chandigarh- based IDS Infotech and Aeromatrix. In 2013, billionaire Indian arms dealer Abhishek Verma and his Romanian born wife Anca Neacsu were named suspects in this scandal. Abhishek had played the role of a middleman in the deal and had interfaced with the politicians in securing CCS clearance from the Cabinet Committee. This nexus was exposed by TimesNow TV with their global investigation. According to the investigators, part of the bribes from AgustaWestland was sent to Abhishek's companies Atlas Defence Systems accounts in Mauritius, to Bermuda accounts of Atlas Group Ltd and the other part was diverted to his wife's front company in New York, Ganton Limited. These funds are suspected to have been sent to Indian politicians who were beneficiaries in this scandal. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had first identified the role of Abhishek Verma and his wife Anca Neacsu in 2013 in several of his blogs and press-releases. Later in April 2017, the Verma couple were exonerated from these allegations of corruption by CBI Special Court of Judge Anju Bajaj Chandana. In September 2015, a special CBI court issued an open non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Christian Michel based on a CBI report that he was needed to be questioned in the case to know how much amount he had received as \\"commission\\" in the deal. The CBI said that \\"Based on this arrest warrant, Interpol India would be requested to issue a Red Corner Notice against Christian Michel James and execute said warrant.\\" In an interview to a newspaper, he denied any wrongdoing by stating that he had never met any \\"Gandhi\\" in his life. Enforcement Directorate (ED) is investigating money laundering allegations. In March 2015, the ED traced and identified the properties worth around 1.12 crore owned by Christian Michel and issued a provisional attachment order. The ED claimed that Michel bought a flat in south Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave in the name of media firm Media Exim using the bribe money. He was also reportedly in possession of a luxury car and a Fixed Deposit of 54 lakh. In September 2015, the adjudicating authority confirmed the attachment of properties and allowed the agency to retain the properties. In September 2015, the ED attached assets worth about 7 crore alleged to be in the name of family members of ex-IAF Chief S. P. Tyagi. The CBI and the ED have sent letters rogatory to as many as eight countries including Italy, Tunisia, Mauritius, the UAE, the UK, Switzerland, Singapore and the British Virgin Islands.  Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation  On 27 February 2013, UPA-II Government introduced a motion in Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) for an investigation led by a 30-member Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). The motion was passed after a walkout by most of the opposition parties like BJP, JD(U), Trinamool Congress, CPI, TDP and AGP. During the debate, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said the JPC was an \\"exercise in futility\\" and a \\"diversionary tactic.\\" He argued that the case involved various legal aspects such as extradition of accused foreigners and custodial interrogation and the JPC can have \\"none of these powers,\\" leaving it ineffective. Many opposition members demanded Supreme Court-monitored investigation (on the similar lines of 2G spectrum case). Demands were also made to establish money trail and issue Letter Rogatory (LR). The UPA government initially denied all allegations and claimed it has \\"nothing to hide\\" and that \\"our track record is not cover up.\\"  Cancellation of the contract by the Indian Government  India cancelled the 3,600 crore deal with AgustaWestland in January 2014. The government cancelled the contract \\"on grounds of breach of the Pre-contract Integrity Pact and the agreement by AWIL (AgustaWestland International Ltd)\\". The contract was frozen in February 2013 after allegations surfaced that was paid as a bribe.  Decision-Makers  Senior officials involved in the decision- making process that led to the selection of the AgustaWestland helicopters for VVIP use were M. K. Narayanan (Indian Police Service (IPS), former Director Intelligence Bureau (India) and NSA); B V Wanchoo (IPS, and Chief of Special Protection Group); and Shashi Kant Sharma, IAS, and former defence secretary. After their tenures at the centre, the UPA Government made M.K. Narayanan governor of West Bengal, B.V. Wanchoo governor of Goa and Shashikant Sharma Comptroller and Auditor General of India.  CBI probe The CBI approached Union Law Ministry to record statements of M. K. Narayanan and B. V. Wanchoo in January 2014. M.K Narayanan and B. V. Wanchoo were West Bengal and Goa Governors respectively at the time of CBI's request. Their statements were considered vital as they were National Security Adviser and Special Protection Group (SPG) chief at the time of the signing of the contract with AgustaWestland. Their views were also considered before the Indian Government signed the contract with AgustaWestland. However, Kapil Sibal's Union Law ministry stonewalled the CBI probe by rejecting CBI's request to examine them under the usual excuse of \\"immunity.\\" The CBI, therefore, approached President Pranab Mukherjee to seek permission to examine ex-NSA and ex-chief of SPG. M. K. Narayanan and B. V. Wanchoo were questioned by CBI later in June and July 2014 respectively. Recovery of bank guarantee After the cancellation of the contract, India encashed over made by AgustaWestland as a bank guarantee in the Indian banks in January 2014. Separately, India requested the Italian government to retrieve the bank guarantee amount made by the firm in Italian banks which was more than €275 million (23.64 billion). On 17 March 2014, a request made by India was rejected by an Italian court. However, the appellate court in Milan reversed the lower court's judgement and upheld the claims of the Indian government. Accordingly, in June 2014, the Indian government encashed , taking the total amount recovered so far to . With this, India was reported to have recovered the entire amount of around (45% of the total contract value ) it had paid to AgustaWestland. However, it was later reported that AgustaWestland had not returned the entire amount, and kept €106 million for three helicopters it had delivered. Italian Court judgments The Italian court, investigating the case in October 2014, acquitted ex-IAF Chief S.P. Tyagi of all corruption charges. It also acquitted the former Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi and former AgustaWestland head Bruno Spagnolini of “charges of international corruption.” The court, however, convicted and sentenced them to two years in prison on the lesser charge of “false invoicing” in the case. On 8 April 2016, the Milan Court of Appeal, in a 225-page judgement, overturned the lower court verdict and sentenced Giuseppe Orsi to four years' imprisonment. Then, on 16 December 2016, the Corte di Cassazione (Supreme Court) cancelled the Appeals Court guilty verdict, and ordered a retrial, referring the matter to a different Court of Appeal, always in Milan.https://thewire.in/87655/agustawestland-finmeccanica-retrial/ After nine months of proceedings, on 8 January 2018, the Milan Third Court of Appeals finally cleared the defendants and dismissed all charges, on grounds of insufficient evidence provided by the prosecution to support the allegations The verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassazione on May 22, 2019 after the Milan General Prosecutor's office failed to have a recourse supported by the Attorney General.

Its mission is to advance urban health and reduce health inequities through research and knowledge mobilization on the social determinants of health focusing on the relationships between health and housing, poverty and income distribution, social exclusion and other social and economic inequalities. The WI publishes policy papers, research studies, reports and recommendations through its website. The Wellesley Institute is a registered non-profit charity. History Founded In 1912 by Dr. Herbert Bruce, the Wellesley Hospital was as a private-paying hospital in Toronto, Ontario, later becoming publicly operated in 1942. On August 25, 1948, the hospital underwent a formal amalgamation with Toronto General Hospital becoming the Wellesley Division of the Toronto General Hospital. In 1998 The Wellesley Division of Wellesley Central Hospital was closed by the Ontario government on the recommendation of the Ontario Health Services Restructuring Commission and the bulk of its programs were transferred between 1998 and 2002 to St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. In its place, the Wellesley Central Health Corporation was established issuing a transition from a health service provider to a leader in urban health championing. The WCHC also oversaw the site transformation of the closed hospital to a long-term care facility, non- profit supportive housing complex, for-profit housing and the Wellesley Central Park. In 2006 the WCHC changed its name to the Wellesley Institute to reflect its evolution from developer into a think tank. On March 24, 2014, Dr. Kwame McKenzie was appointed the new CEO of Wellesley Institute.http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/newsroom/news_releases_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/current_year/Pages/Dr.-Kwame- McKenzie-appointed-new-CEO-of-Wellesley- Institute.aspxhttp://www.wellesleyinstitute.com/healthy-communities/welcoming- our-new-ceo/  See also  *Wellesley Hospital  References  External links  * Non-profit organizations based in Toronto Medical and health organizations based in Ontario Political and economic think tanks based in Canada ","title":"Wellesley Institute"},{"id":"38639251","text":"Tough Grit – The Rural America Challenge is a weekly 30-minute television show produced by GRIT magazine and Berkeley Square Media, Inc. with major sponsorship provided by Tractor Supply Company, broadcast nationally on the satellite/cable channel RFD-TV.RFD-TV: Tough Grit.

She also gained some popularity prior to the band's inception by performing guest vocals for the symphonic power metal band Kamelot, both on tour and in the studio. She sings in the soprano range.  Career = Early career = Elize was born to a Swedish father and a Finnish mother, both of whom were musicians. She performed in public for the first time when she was 4-years-old. During her childhood, she was influenced by everything from Walt Disney to heavy metal. At the age of 13, she attended and won a 1998 talent show in Gothenburg as the youngest participant. The first prize was a record deal, but since she did not meet the minimum of age of 15, she was ineligible to receive the prize. She received a scholarship for the most promising singer and a spot in a musical called Brödupploppet that was played 76 times at Exercishuset in Gothenburg. She received another scholarship award in 2003, when she graduated from high school. Ryd started out her professional singing career, after graduating from a three-year education at Performing Arts School, as a cabaret performer at the Cabaret Lorensberg in Gothenburg. She also did songs for various local bands such as Falconer. When she met Joacim \\"Jake E\\" Lundberg in a club in Gothenburg, he requested that she record vocals for a song with his band Dreamland, titled \\"Fade Away\\". Lundberg later introduced her to Olof Mörck, who proposed a collaboration with his band Dragonland, to which she agreed. It was around this time that symphonic metal band Nightwish took interest in Ryd as a replacement for their previous singer Tarja Turunen, although she was ultimately not chosen for the role. At the same time, she, Mörck, and Lundberg talked about starting their own band with her as a lead singer and composer. The band was named Avalanche, which was later renamed to Amaranthe for legal reasons.http://www.rockbladet.se/2012/11/reportage-elize-ryd-the-rising-queen- of-metal-part-i-eng/ = Amaranthe = Tuska Open Air 2013 In early 2009, Amaranthe released their debut EP, Leave Everything Behind. In early 2011, they released their first two singles, \\"Hunger\\" and \\"Rain\\" before releasing their debut album Amaranthe, which reached a peak position of 35th on Swedish charts and 16th on Finnish Charts. With this album, the band released two music videos: one for the aforementioned song \\"Hunger\\" and another for the song \\"Amaranthine\\". Both were directed by Patric Ullaeus for Revolver Films. There was also a video shot for \\"1.000.000 Lightyears\\", the fourth single from their debut album. On January 25, 2013, Amaranthe released a new single titled \\"The Nexus\\" and a music video on 13 March. Amaranthe's second album, The Nexus, was released in March 2013. Later in 2013, Amaranthe released two videos for their singles \\"Burn with Me\\" and \\"Invincible.\\" Amaranthe released a new single and video for \\"Drop Dead Cynical\\" in September 2014.

On September 28, 2012, whilst supporting Nightwish's North American leg of the Imaginaerum World Tour with Kamelot, Ryd and fellow Kamelot touring vocalist Alissa White-Gluz of The Agonist joined symphonic metal band Nightwish for a one-time concert in Denver when their lead vocalist Anette Olzon was hospitalized. In September 2018, Ryd was part of the DVD recording of \\"I Am The Empire Live From The 013\\", released on August 14, 2020. = Other collaborations = Since Amaranthe's explosion in popularity, Ryd has been featured on songs by several different artists she had not previously collaborated with. In 2011, she had three notable collaborations that were all released commercially. These consisted of guest vocals for Swedish rock band Takida's fourth album The Burning Heart and Renegade Five's September 2011 EP Life Is Already Fading. Beside fellow Amaranthe vocalists Jake E. and Andreas Solveström, Elize was once again featured on a Dragonland album; this time being the band's fifth album Under the Grey Banner.

Carmine Carlos Mirabelli (2 January 1889 - 30 April 1951) was a Brazilian physical medium and Spiritualist.Anderson, Rodger. (2006). Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies. McFarland & Company. p. 121. Biography Mirabelli was born in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, of Italian parents. He studied Spiritism at an early age and was introduced to the writings of Allan Kardec. As a teenager he worked in a shoe shop and claimed to have experienced poltergeist activity where shoe boxes would literally fly off the shelves. He was placed in a lunatic asylum for observation and psychologists said there was something wrong with him, but he was not physically sick.Buckland, Raymond. (2005). The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication. Visible Ink Press. p. 259. Mirabelli later became a medium and it was alleged he could produce automatic handwriting, materializations of objects and people (ectoplasm), levitations and movement of objects.Mello, Antônio da Silva. (1960). Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. pp. 382-385 In the 1920s, Mirabelli was tested by the Academia de Estudos Psychicos Cesare Lombroso in São Paulo and a report published in 1926 wrote that in more than 300 sittings genuine materializations had been observed. When the report was published in English, it was challenged by various psychical researchers. In 1928, the German scientist Hans Driesch investigated Mirabelli and found that some objects had been moved in the séance room but that there was no evidence for his supposed abilities of materialization or apportation. Mirabelli later began giving public mediumship demonstrations which were described as theatrical displays. Throughout his life Mirabelli had been involved with 15 lawsuits for the illegal practice of witchcraft. He was suspected of utilizing tricks.Aykroyd, Peter H; Narth, Angela; Aykroyd, Dan. (2009). A History of Ghosts: The True Story of Séances, Mediums, Ghosts, and Ghostbusters. Rodale Books. pp. 92-95. It was alleged that Mirabelli could move bottles of magnetized water on a table without contact with them. This was disputed by Antônio da Silva Mello who noted that such a trick could have been performed \\"by means of a thread led to the table or by several other means, principally by the help of a partner who in this particular case was suspected by several persons present to be the medium's wife.\\" Society for Psychical Research Investigation In 1934 Theodore Besterman, a research officer for the Society for Psychical Research, visited Brazil to investigate Mirabelli. He discovered that some of the witness reports from the Academia de Estudos Psychicos Cesare Lombroso were unreliable and it was not an independent organization but one that was associated with Mirabelli and his personal friends. Whilst investigating the séances, Besterman claimed to have detected trickery. Levitation trick In 1990, Dr. Gordon Stein found a levitation photograph of Mirabelli in the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) collection at the Cambridge University Library. It was inscribed by Mirabelli to Besterman from his visit in 1934.Stein, Gordon. (1996). Carlos Mirabelli. In The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 400-404. The levitation in the photograph was discovered to be a trick as there were signs of chemical retouching under Mirabelli's feet. The retouching showed that Mirabelli was not levitating but was standing on a ladder which was erased from the photograph.Nickell, Joe. (2005). Camera Clues: A Handbook for Photographic Investigation. University Press of Kentucky. p. 178. According to Stein: :The fact that the fraudulent photo has been inscribed by Mirabelli to Besterman means that Mirabelli, then at the very peak of his powers was at least in pan, a fraud. He knowingly passed off a fraudulent photo of himself as authentic. It should make us cautious about accepting hearsay statements of Mirabelli's followers about the many wonders he had performed. More importantly, it should make us very cautious about accepting at face value other photographs of Mirabelli's marvels. ReferencesFurther reading *Theodore Besterman. (1935).

It displays a collection of mainly Western art and ceramics, and Chinese porcelain, donated by art collector Johannes Mikkel in 1994. History The museum was founded to house the art collection of Johannes Mikkel, who in 1994 had donated his collection of foreign art to the Art Museum of Estonia. Johannes Mikkel (1907-2006) came from southern Estonia, studied various subjects (including art) at the University of Tartu and worked, after World War II, in Tallinn as a manager in several antique shops. Through his vast network he was able to assemble the collection of the present museum. In 1996, the former kitchen building (built 1754) of nearby Kadriorg Palace, where the Art Museum of Estonia's main collection of foreign art is displayed, was renovated to house the Mikkel collection. Collection The museum contains about 600 objects. The nucleus of the collection is the large amount of Western graphic art from the 16th to 19th centuries, with a special focus on the Dutch Golden Age. The part of the collection devoted to graphics include works by Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach, Rembrandt, Claude Lorrain, Adriaen van Ostade, Jacob van Ruisdael and Félicien Rops. A substantial part of the collection is also devoted to paintings from roughly the same time span; painting by Melchior d'Hondecoeter and Jean François de Troy could be mentioned, as well as a portrait from the studio of Anthony van Dyck. In addition to pictures, the collection also displays a set of European ceramics and Chinese porcelain. The Mikkel collection is indeed the only place in Estonia to house a representative European ceramics collection, spanning several centuries. The core of the collection are several pieces of Meissen porcelain, but also features pieces of Sèvres porcelain, Royal Copenhagen porcelain and Russian Imperial porcelain. The Chinese porcelain collection is focused on blue-and-white porcelain.

It was produced by Malith Palliyaguruge, the film had music scored by Rohana Weerasinghe. The film marked the debut acting by Kollywood actress Pooja in Sinhala cinema.

Synopsis  A young man named Thivanka returns home to Sri Lanka from England to fall in love with a village girl named Anjalika. This proves to be problematic for Thivanka, as Anjalika is the daughter of a plantation caretaker employed by Thivanka's father. Thivanka's childhood friend, Kavya is in love with Thivanka and wants to marry him. The inevitable clash of rich and poor ends in the kidnapping and subsequent death of Anjalika. Thivanka, reeling from grief, decides to accompany a friend to Malaysia to clear his mind. While there, he meets a girl named Uttara who is identical to Anjalika. He eventually learns that the girl is Anjalika, and her death was faked by his father, Clifford, who mistakenly thought he was Anjalika's biological father, and that he therefore needed to stop the marriage between Thivanka and Anjalika. Finally, Thivanka and Anjalika marry while Kavya marries Thivanka's friend Gagana.

The organization was founded by Dalit Sharon and Rina Padwa, two artists with rich experience in their respective fields, to create a platform for artistic and social activity and provide a unique place for artists with special needs and for artists who are dealing with mental health problems. The center enables participants to acquire training as artists, musicians and actors, to fulfill their talents and get paid for their art, as a part of their rehabilitation. This concept is based on the belief that the satisfaction from creating, combined with becoming a productive and contributing individual in the community, is leading to a personal and emotional development for each participant, enriches life skills and self esteem. Theater shows, exhibitions and music concerts by Kenafayim’s artists expose the wide audience to their unique worlds, and allow cultural interaction and mutual involvement. Two groups of artists operate in Kenafayim: a group of artists struggling with mental illnesses and a group of artists with mental retardation. The artistic activity in Kenafayim focuses on theater, music, visual art, cinema and writing, and it takes place every day in the morning.  History  * In 2004 Kenafayim organization was established. * In 2008 Kenafayim established the Kenafyim Lobby Gallery at Shapira Community Center in Tel Aviv . * In 2009 (and the year after that) Kenafayim represented Israel at the International Theatre Festival \\"No Limits\\" in Berlin with the play \\"Silver Spoon\\".Kenafayim at No Limits festival * In 2010 the city of Tel Aviv granted Kenafayim a house in order to build the “Kenafayim Center\\" – a complex of art studios combined with theater hall, gallery and a bar, a house in which the artists of Kenafayim would create and from where they would distribute the products of their art to the public.Municipality of Tel - Aviv - Jaffa improves the city for people with disabilities * In 2011 Kenafyim represented Israel with the play \\"Silver spoon\\" at the international “Creahm” festival in Belgium.Silver Spoon at Creahm Kenafayim's artists represented artists with disabilities at The Museum of Everything in London.4 Kenafayim Artists In The Museum Of Everything’s ‘Exhibition #4′ * In 2012 Kenafayim represented Israel with the play \\"Silver spoon\\" at the international festival \\"Nit Ariadni\\" in Russia,Расправляя Крылья - 03.12.2012 БФ Джойнт и организация Сохнут показали москвичам Крылья «КНАФАИМ» РАСПРАВИЛИ КРЫЛЬЯ В МОСКВЕ while their artists exhibited their works in Pushkin Museum. Kenafayim's representatives have met with the leading psychiatrists, decision makers (including president Vladimir Putin adviser on matters of disabilities) and the media in Russia to advise them on the issue of art's role in rehabilitation and explain the infrastructure needed for establishing enterprises such as Kenafayim's art centers in Russia. In the same year Kenafayim made history by becoming the first organisation in the Middle East to have their play \\"Silver Spoon\\" played by actors with mental retardation included in the nationwide culture program for high schools.Don't say stupid spoon At that year, in Israel, Tel Aviv, the first single from the disc of Kenafayim Project \\"Stepping into life\\" came out. The single was launched in a fundraising gala evening with Berry Sakharof. In the same year joined the organization Yossi Aud as a CEO. Yossi Aud is a social - educational entrepreneur, who co-founded and managed educational and social change organizations around the country.  Activity  Participants who are dealing with mental health crises study and engage in music, theater, cinema and visual arts activities. About fifty people are participating every day, where they get to learn and create in a supportive environment. Their creations are exhibited in private and public galleries and exhibitions throughout Israel and abroad, and their plays and concerts are played around the world. Kenafayim operates to enable the rehabilitation of artists who are dealing with mental health crises by working professionally in the area of their own artistic talent. The activity in Kenafayim improves the confidence and the status of its participants in society, thus helping them to become more independent and active citizens and a productive part of the society. Once in a week a \\"meeting with an artist\\" workshop is being held, bringing famous artists and musicians to present their work to Kenafayim’s participants. Kenafyim operates two programs into two different groups: * The first group consists of artists (musicians, painters, singers, sculptors and actors) who are dealing with mental health crises such as schizophrenia, clinical depression and obsessive - compulsive disorder.Spreading their wings: Life changing theater The work in Kenafayim allows them to fulfill their talents, empowers them and enables to develop the artistic and social skills they lost, to get inspired and to gradually recover. Performances and exhibitions of Kenafayim's artists are regularly presented in Israel and abroad and get paid for their art products and for performers. * The second group consists of actors with mental retardation of varying degrees. The group performs regularly in the best theater halls in Israel and at festivals abroad.

Its name was changed in 2018 to FishAct. FishAct's stated mission is to \\"end the industrial overfishing of the oceans\\" and to \\"empower individuals to get actively involved in building grassroots citizen- led conservation communities\\". The non-governmental organisation was founded in 2010 and has active local chapters in Germany and the United Kingdom. To achieve its goals, the organisation uses a combination of investigation, education, and non-violent direct-action. Campaigns have included gathering support for the release of captive cetaceans, actions against dolphin drive hunts and campaigning to end overfishing of the endangered bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean Sea. Notable activities In September 2010 activists of The Black Fish cut the nets of holding pens in the harbour of Taiji, Japan to allow dolphins to escape, which were destined for the international dolphinarium trade. Captain Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society publicly questioned the effectiveness of the action, saying nets had been cut but no dolphins had managed to escape. These allegations were later answered by the activists involved, claiming dolphins did escape from the pens. After only a few weeks of campaigning by The Black Fish and other organisations for the closure of a run-down dolphinarium in Münster, Germany, in the fall of 2010, its owners announced that the facility would be closed down and the four dolphins kept there, re-homed. By early 2011, The Black Fish had founded the Orca Coalition together with seven other organisation, with the aim of securing freedom for a captive orca named Morgan. The young female killer whale had stranded on the Dutch coast in June 2010. Although she regained her strength and was nursed back to health, the dolphinarium where she was held refuses to release her, instead planning for a transfer to the marine park Loro Parque on the Spanish Island of Tenerife. The initial legal proceedings brought against the responsible Ministry by the Orca Coalition secured a landmark court ruling, effectively blocking the export of a captive cetacean for the first time. However, two months later a second judge ruled that orca Morgan could be moved to Loro Parque. In July 2012 the organisation successfully released over 1.000 endangered bluefin tuna from a tuna farm off the island of Ugljan, Croatia. English writer and environmentalist George Monbiot hailed the action and branded the activists as heroes for 'putting their lives on the line in the fight to save endangered tuna'. Croatian Deputy Fisheries Minister Ljubomir Kucic criticised the action, proclaiming that bluefin tuna are 'not that endangered'. In December 2012 a stranded humpback whale off the Dutch coast gathered a lot of controversy as local authorities refused access to the stranding site by independent cetacean experts to free the animal. After an initial attempt by local authorities to pull the animal back to open water had failed, the local mayor declared a state of emergency, prohibiting anyone from entering the site. For a number of days the whale lived on, even after an unsuccessful euthanasia attempt. On the 5th day after the stranding, The Black Fish deployed a boat and visited the stranding site with Dutch politician Marianne Thieme and a medical team to assess whether or not animal was still alive. The Black Fish skipper and one of the boat's crew were held by police and a report was filed for possible charges of breaching the state of emergency. Current focus In an interview with The Guardian in August 2012, co-founder of The Black Fish, Wietse van der Werf, announced that the organisation's focus would switch exclusively to exposing and challenging illegal and destructive fishing practices in the Mediterranean Sea, with initial actions aimed at combating illegal bluefin tuna fishing and the illegal use of driftnets. The BBC broadcast a programme in April 2013, in which The Black Fish founder Wietse van der Werf announced that the organisation will start using drones to patrol for illegal fishing activity in the Mediterranean.

After serving for many years as the Irish Bankruptcy judge, he was transferred to the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 2 p.380 His much younger friend Maurice Healy described him with great respect and affection in his memoir The Old Munster Circuit. Boyd's eldest son Sir Walter Herbert Boyd, 2nd Baronet, is still remembered in the sailing world as the designer of the Howth 17 yacht. His second son Dr. Cecil Boyd was a noted rugby player. Background He was born on what is now Walworth Road in Portobello, Dublin, the fourth son of Walter Boyd and his second wife Jane MacRory, daughter of Robert MacRory of Castledawson, County Londonderry.Ball p.380 He was educated at the University of Dublin where he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1855 and Doctor of Laws in 1864.Ball p.380 He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1854 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1856. He took silk in 1877 and became Queen's Advocate for Ireland the following year. In politics he was a staunch Unionist: his wife's family, the Andersons, played a crucial role in maintaining British rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century. He did not enjoy much of a reputation as a lawyer, but following in the tradition of John Philpot Curran and Daniel O'Connell, he was noted for his absolute fearlessness in Court. Maurice Healy recalls a well-known story that Mr Justice O'Brien angrily asked him: where was Dr Boyd'sA reference to his Doctorate in law, not a medical degree. respect for the Court? Boyd replied that the Court was receiving the exact degree of respect it deserved.Healy, Maurice The Old Munster Circuit 1939 Mercier Press Reissue 1979 p.32 Judge In 1885 he was appointed the Irish Bankruptcy judge.Ball p.380 Maurice Healy thought that the office suited him well: while he was not an especially acute lawyer, he had a great deal of common sense, and a remarkable ability to detect commercial dishonesty. He was also, according to Healy, a man of great physical courage, which was an important consideration at a time when the level of agrarian unrest meant that his life might be threatened (he had two policemen assigned to act as his bodyguards).Healy pp.30–31 He had a gift for uncovering fraud; unfortunately, in Healy's view, his experience as a judge led him to assume that almost all human beings are dishonest by nature, and although he did not lose his essential kindness or good humour, he became something of a cynic.Healy p.30 He had little patience with legal technicalities: \\"I don't want evidence, I want the truth!\\" he once thundered at a barrister who had unwisely objected to the judge admitting hearsay evidence.Healy p.116 In 1897 the reorganisation of the High Court led to Boyd's transfer to the King's Bench Division.Ball p.380 Maurice Healy states that the universal affection and respect in which the Bar held him meant that he could always rely on the support of counsel on both sides to overcome any deficiencies in his own knowledge of the law.Healy p.31 He was also fortunate that the quality of his judicial colleagues was very high; when he was sitting with more learned judges like Christopher Palles he would generally defer to their greater expertise. He rarely dealt with criminal cases until his last few years on the Bench. Towards the end of his career, when a shortage of High Court judges made it necessary for him to go on the criminal assizes, he acquired a reputation for imposing exceptionally severe penalties: some of the sentences he handed down while holding the Munster assize in 1910 were so harsh that, according to Healy, the sessions became popularly known as \\"the Mad Assize\\".Healy p.103 On the other hand, his great kindness of heart meant that he was always willing to recommend a reprieve from the death penalty, if he thought that there were any mitigating circumstances in the case.Healy pp.108–9 His short judgement in the probate case, Crofts v Beamish,[1905] 2 I.R. 345 where three High Court judges were unable to agree on the proper interpretation of a will, gives a flavour of his robust style and forceful personality. Boyd admitted frankly that he had no idea what the testator meant, and added : \\"I do not think he himself knew what he meant. More extraordinary words I have never come across.\\" Last years Boyd retired in 1916, and was created a Baronet, and a member of the Irish Privy Council.Ball p.380 He lived at Howth House, Howth, which his father had purchased, and where he pursued his great love of sailing, even into extreme old age. He was one of the stalwarts of the Howth Yacht Club. In 1897 his son Walter Herbert Boyd designed the Howth 17th Footer, now the oldest one-design keelboat racing class in the world. The judge owned one of the first 17th footers, the Aura, which was launched in 1899: he was still sailing her when he was over 80. He died on 25 June 1918. Family Sir Robert Anderson of Scotland Yard, whose sister Anne married Boyd. In 1862 he married Anne Catherine Anderson of Dublin, daughter of Matthew Anderson, Crown solicitor, by his wife Mary Lee. Annie was the sister of Sir Samuel Lee Anderson, and of Sir Robert Anderson, Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police: she died in 1920.Mosley ed.

In his famous memoir The Old Munster Circuit Healy recalls Boyd as \\" a warrior\\":Healy p.30 a man of boundless vitality and good humour. As a judge he lacked the legal eminence of some of his colleagues, but he was blessed with great common sense, a shrewd if somewhat cynical knowledge of human nature, and a strong sense of justice. Despite some faults and prejudices, Healy notes that he was \\"beloved by all\\".Healy pp.30–31 His wife Annie was a devout Evangelical Protestant: less is known of her husband's religious beliefs, although according to Healy a friend once called him \\"the last of the pagans\\".Healy p.30 A sketch by Thomas Bodkin shows Boyd as a gaunt elderly man with a flowing white beard.

Created in 1945, it was one of seven academies of Fine Arts in Poland. The academy was renamed in honor of one of its founders, Władysław Strzemiński, in 1988. The Academy offers a wide variety of educational fine art programs in fashion design, jewelry design, visual communication, film and digital art, art theory and history, photography, textile arts, as well as several other art-focused degree programs.http://int.asp.lodz.pl/studies Faculties & Studies The school is located on 121 Wojska Polskiego Street in Łódź. The Academy, headed by its president Professor Grzegorz Chojnacki, employs 63 faculty members to instruct its 1118 students.  History  The Academy was created in 1945 as a Public Academy of Arts in Łódź. It was created by many local artists such as Władysław Strzemiński and Stefan Wagner, as well as invited guests from abroad: Felicjan Szczęsny Kowarski, Roman Modzelewski, Ludwik Tyrowicz, Władysław Daszewski and Stefan Byrski. At first, there were only three departments: the Department of Fabric and Cloths, the Department of Ceramic and Department of Graphics. The Academy's first president was Leon Ormezowski. The professors and founders spent the first two years creating the Academy's program by searching for inspiration in artistic and didactic literary outputs of bauhaus and Kazimierz Malewicz’s pedagogical experience. Władysław Strzemiński had a great influence on the Academy’s development, both through his five years of teaching and through his artistic and didactic approach. In honor of his contributions and influence, the Academy adopted his name in 1988. Strzemiński was a painter, a theoretician and a teacher of avant-garde of international renown. Known as the creator of Unism Theory, Strzemińskiwas also strongly connected with Łódź even though he hailed from Mińsk. He lost his arm, leg and sight in one eye during the First World War, but that did not discourage him from continuing with his artistic education. He ended up as an assistant to Kazimierz Malewicz in Russia. Within just a few years, he found himself in the forefront of Russia’s avant-garde movement, working with Eliezer Lisicki and Alexander Rodchenko. In 1931, he came to live in Łódź for good. There he developed his Association of Polish Artists and Designers. In 1932, he received a Reward of Town Łódź. Due to expansion, the Academy moved to larger and more modern premises in 1976. Prior to then, the school had been located in a post-war building. The new building was designed by Bolesław Kardaszewski. This monumental building is an example of Kardaszewski's contemporary realizations, designed just for the artistic academy. The name of the Academy was changed at the end of the 20th century. In 1996, it was renamed to its current title, \\"Academy of Fine Arts\\".  Scientific activity  The Academy organizes various competitions, displays and fashion shows for their students. Also, the Academy cooperates with foreign academies not only for the Erasmus Programme for student exchange, but also for internship placements and employees’ scientific delegations. Selected cities with which the Academy cooperates are Hasselt, Belgium; Wielkie Tyrnowo, Bulgaria; Zlin, Czech Republic; Helsinki; Grenoble, Lyon, and Paris, France; Alicante, Burgos, Málaga, and Valencia, Spain; Dublin; Dortmund and Berlin, Germany; Lisbon; Geneva; Izmir; Budapest; Florence, Urbino, and Brescia, Italy.  Students' success  Some students publicize their connection to the Academy all around the world by taking part in competitions organized by various academic institutions. Recent student achievements include: *Daria Piotrowska won the third edition of Young Design contest organized by the Institute for Urban Design. Her project, Project “CATPOD” is a transport for housecats with which she defeated nine other projects that qualified to the finals. *Katarzyna Malec, a third-year student from the Design and Interior Architecture Department, won first prize in a “Spa-Art” 09/10 contest for her “YinYang” project. *Dominka Drezner won with a design of a new baby carriage for a competition organized by producers and distributors of such devises. *Joanna Leszczyńska received the Grand Prix 2012 for graphics. *Ewa Buksa-Klinowska, a student of the Jewelry Department, was honored with the 24th International Cloisonné Jewelry Contest.

It was released in 1968 by MCA's Universal City Records (UNI). Giant Crab evolved from Ernie and the Emperors, a popular local band out of Santa Barbara, California.  Personnel  Giant Crab was formed around three Orosco brothers, Ernie, Raymond, and Ruben, all originally from the group Ernie & The Emperors. They added the stylings of brothers Dennis and Kenny Fricia to complete their line-up for their debut album. It also included a title track narrative by radio DJ, Johnny Fairchild. * Ernie Orosco (Lead singer, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, 12-string guitar, vocal harmonies) * Raymond Orosco (12-string, dry box, and bass guitars, clavinet, special effects, and vocal harmonies) * Ruben Orosco (Bass guitar, drums, saxophones, special effects, and vocal harmonies) * Dennis Fricia (Drums, horn (instrument), special effects, and vocal harmonies) * Kenny Fricia (Organ (instrument), piano, clavinet, horns, vibes, special effects and vocal harmonies)  Album content  The album leads off with an unusual tone, a title track narrated in the style of a news report by Johnny Fairchild. Fairchild was a local DJ from the Santa Barbara, California radio station, Radio K.I.S.T. He is given credit for the band's first radio air play. Fairchild's narration in the title track encompasses the titles of all the tracks in the album to follow. The words from the title track are written on the back cover of the original LP, in the style of a track listing. They are as follows: :\\"News has it that a giant crab has come forth out of the sea of music and is catching on and spreading across the land. Through struggles and hardships, ups and downs, trials and tribulations, a tiny amoeba, fighting for existence has grown into a giant crab. It started with a little kiss, of enthusiasm and the directions of the giant crab at this point are unknown. But they could pop up at any minute in you home. So watch your step for this musical giant is out to intensify your soul. The giant crab's only hope is that you will enjoy it enough to become involved in a hot line conversation that will spread :across the land. If you or I enjoy being the boy or girl it is our duty to inform Lydia Purple and the rest of the world...Flash...It has just been reported that :the giant crab is about to invade Groovy Towne inland, coming thru the fields. The chance you take is yours alone. Can you get out of the magic grasp of the giant crab? Believe it or not, The answer is no. For once you have felt the golden touch of the giant crab you will be shouting hi ho silver lining along with thousands of other helpless people caught up in their grasp. Why am I so proud? Listen and you will :see...Listen...Listen...Listen...Listen...\\" The album consists of 11 original tracks, written primarily by Ernie Orosco, and four cover songs. Their take on Joey Levine's \\"I Enjoy Being The Boy\\" is the band's version of \\"I Enjoy Being A Boy\\", a song popularized by The Banana Splits on their TV show. Their version of \\"Lydia Purple\\", a cover of The Collectors (from their self-titled debut, The Collectors) is one of three versions of the song that were released by different bands that year, and it is arguably Giant Crab's most complicated arrangement on the album. The band chose \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\" as a single, likely because a version of the song was already a hit in the U.K. for The Jeff Beck Group.

He spent the next 26 years of his long life as a beggar for the Order and died with a great reputation for holiness. He has been beatified by the Catholic Church. Early life Aparicio was born in A Gudiña, Ourense, in the Galician region of Spain. He was the third child and only son of Juan de Aparicio and Teresa del Prado, who were poor, but pious peasants, and spent his childhood tending sheep and cattle and in service to those of means. He learned his prayers from his parents, but had no schooling, and was not able to read or write. Despite his illiteracy, he had absorbed the discourse on how to lead a pious and holy life that he could emulate models in hagiographic texts.Ronald J. Morgan, Spanish American Saints and the Rhetoric of Identity, 1600–1810, Tucson: Arizona State Press 2002, p. 36. According to his own account, his life was saved in a seemingly-miraculous way during an outbreak of the bubonic plague in his town in 1514. Forced to isolate him from the community in quarantine, his parents built a hidden shelter for him in the woods, where they left him. While lying there helpless, due to his illness, a she-wolf found the hiding spot and, poking her head into his hiding spot, sniffed and then bit and licked an infected site on his body, before running off. He began to heal from that moment. When Aparicio was older, he determined to seek work outside his region in order to help support his family and to provide dowries for his sisters. He traveled east to Salamanca and then as far south as Sanlúcar de Barrameda, doing agricultural work. Apparently, due to his good looks, he was frequently the target of sexual advances by women, which violated his determination to live a life of chastity. He finally decided to escape the situation and to improve his fortune by traveling to the newly conquered Americas. He also desired to help the conquered peoples of Spain's new lands and to foster the Catholic faith there. Parish church of Gudiña, where the Blessed Sebastian was baptized as a newborn Mexico=Successful Entrepreneur= Aparicio sailed from Spain in 1533, landing in Veracruz later that year. With the growth of the cattle trade introduced to the Americas by the Spanish and the landgrants offered to colonists by the Spanish government, he decided to move farther inland to Puebla de los Ángeles, recently founded by the Franciscan friar, Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, one of the Twelve Apostles of Mexico who came to New Spain in 1524 to evangelize the Indians. Once settled in Puebla, Aparicio began to cultivate indigenous maize but also European wheat. He was one of the first Spaniards who raised and trained cattle, another European import, to use in plow farming and transportation.Ronald J. Morgan, ibid. pp. 40–41. He got permission to ride out into the brush and round up wild cattle which he then trained to pull a cart. As a result, he is considered to be the first Mexican “cowboy” or charro. He realized the difficulty of transporting supplies in Mexico, which before the conquest had no domesticated animals to move goods and difficult terrain, which meant that transport between growing Spanish settlements impeded economic expansion. The burden the lack of decent roads caused both the native peoples and animals forced to bear the loads on poor and uneven surfaces through the mountains cutting the countryside. He then conceived the idea of building roads from Puebla to the port of Veracruz, Mexico's main link to Spain. He recruited a fellow Spaniard as a partner in the enterprise, and they approached the colonial authorities for a grant to undertake this construction. Successful in this, they began building the roads which began to connect Spanish communities of Mexico. After several years, he promoted the building of a highway to connect the silver mining city of Zacatecas with Mexico City. The discovery of silver in Mexico in the 1540s was a major event in the economic consolidation of the colony. Aparicio established the transport system which sent agricultural products to Spain and brought necessary items to the residents of New Spain. Aparicio prospered, becoming a wealthy man, but he decided to sell his transport business in 1552. He then bought an expanse of land (hacienda de labor) near Zacatecas, where he farmed and ranched cattle. He began to teach the native people how to use a plow for their farms. He showed them how to domesticate horses and oxen, introduced by the Spanish and unfamiliar to the indigenous population, and how to build wagons for transporting their goods, as wheels had also previously been unknown. He, however, had never lost his commitment to a life of faith. He followed a very ascetic way of life, sleeping on the ground and eating the poorest foods. His charity extended to all, giving much of his wealth to those in need, and lending money without asking anything in return. Eventually feeling pressured to marry, at the age of 60 he became engaged to a young woman who had no hopes of finding a husband, due to her lack of a dowry. They agreed to practice a white marriage, not consummating the union. Though she was much younger, his wife died a year later. He married again two years after that, with one María Esteban, with the same arrangement, only to lose his second wife by the time he was 70. =Friar= Shortly after being widowed for the second time, Aparicio grew seriously ill and began to re-assess his life. He began to dress very simply and to spend long hours in church. Feeling a call to enter the consecrated life, he frequently visited the Franciscan friars in Tlalnepantla. Added to his own doubts were those of a number of the friars as to his ability to follow their life. Finally his confessor made a suggestion: Aparicio would donate his fortune to the first Monastery of Poor Clares in Mexico, founded a few years earlier, and would live as a volunteer on the grounds, serving the external needs of the nuns. He accepted this suggestion, and signed a deed to this effect on 20 December 1573. The following year, despite considerable advice against this from his friends, given his advanced age, Aparicio finally decided to apply to the friars to be admitted as a lay brother. After a year of following the routine of service and prayer followed by nuns, the superiors of the friars decided to accept him, and he received the religious habit of a friar on 9 June 1574, aged 72, at the novitiate of the Order in Mexico City. During the following year of probation, he experienced continued trials, both with the difference in age between himself and his classmates, and in what he experienced as demonic attacks upon his resolve. These ended with his profession of religious vows on 13 June 1575. As he was still illiterate, his document of commitment had to be signed by a fellow friar, Alfonso Peinado. After this, Aparicio was assigned to serve at the friary in Santiago in Tecali, near Puebla. He felt a blessing in this location, dedicated as it is to St. James the Great, the patron saint of his native Galicia, to whom he prayed constantly throughout his life. At the friary, over the course of the following year, he held a number of offices: cook, sacristan, gardener and porter. He was then assigned to the large community of friars in the city of Puebla, at that time consisting of about 100 friars, most of whom were doing their studies or were retired or recovering from illness. He was appointed to be the quaestor of the community, the one assigned to travel throughout the local community, seeking food and alms for the upkeep of the friars and those who came to them for help. The builder of Mexico's highway system had become a beggar on it. Despite his advanced age, he felt the vigor needed for the task. Aparacio was given an oxcart with two oxen to travel through the city and the surrounding villages. He lived on the road for days, sleeping on the ground under the cart in bad weather. He would spend his time meditating on the Passion and on the teachings and example of St. Francis of Assisi. He would hold a rosary in one hand and the reins in the other. He soon became a familiar sight throughout Mexico, known for his cry, Guárdeos Dios, hermanos, ¿hay qué dar, por Dios, a San Francisco? (May God keep you, brothers. Do you have anything to give, for the love of God, to St. Francis?) He spent the last 26 years of his life in this way. He was seen to be a model friar and people declared that wherever Friar Sebastian went, \\"the angels accompanied him\\". From his many years of handling them, even animals followed his orders. Just by his slightest command, horses, oxen and mules would obey his words. The integrity of his life spoke of simplicity and of Christ to the people of the region. Aparicio's level of health, even at the end of his life, was attested to in an incident which occurred while he was on the road. One time, as he was returning to the friary with the cart filled with donations, a wheel started to come off. The friar dismounted and unhooked the oxen from the cart. He then lifted it himself, while he repaired the wheel. The laborer who saw this swore that it would normally have taken four men to lift that cart. He was aged 95 at the time of the incident. Death Basílica de Nuestra Señora de Zapopan. Though he had long suffered from a hernia, Aparicio marked his 98th birthday on the road, apparently in good health. On the following 20 February, he developed what was to be his final illness, as the hernia became entangled. He began to feel pain and nausea, and, upon arrival at the friary, was immediately sent to the infirmary. It was the first time he had slept in a bed in 25 years. As his condition worsened, he became unable to swallow. His only regret was that, due to this, he was unable to receive Holy Communion. As he lay dying, he was consoled by the friars' fulfilling his request that they bring the Blessed Sacrament to his cell. On the evening of 25 February, Aparicio asked to be laid on the ground to meet his death, in imitation of St. Francis. He soon died in the arms of a fellow Galician, Friar Juan de San Buenaventura, with his last word being \\"Jesus\\". When his body lay in state, the crowds that gathered were large, and the miracles wrought were so numerous, that he could not be buried for several days. His habit had to be replaced repeatedly, as mourners would snip a piece of it off to keep as the relic of a saint. When authorities exhumed Aparicio's body six months later, they found that it had not decomposed. Two years later when they exhumed his body again, it still remained incorrupt. After an investigation by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico City, in which nearly 1,000 miracles at his intercession were reported, Pope Pius VI beatified him in 1789 and today his incorrupt body can be seen at the Church of San Francisco in Puebla.

The feud began in 2000 when a drugs seizure led to a split in a gang of young criminals in their late teens and early twenties, most of whom had grown up together and went to the same school. The resulting violence has led to 16 murders and scores of beatings, stabbings, shootings and pipe bomb attacks.  Background  By 2000 a group of young friends from Crumlin, Drimnagh and the south inner city had graduated from stealing cars and street dealing to become major suppliers of drugs in South Dublin. They developed contacts with a major Irish drugs trafficker in Spain who supplied them with cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis. Many of the shipments he delivered to Ireland also included guns which were later used in the feud. Martin \\"Marlo\\" Hyland, a major organised crime figure from North Dublin also supplied guns to one of the feuding factions.Badfellas, Paul Williams (2011) Penguin Ireland On 9 March 2000 at the Holiday Inn on Pearse Street, three members of the gang were arrested with 2 kg of cocaine and 49,000 ecstasy tablets. All three refused to co-operate with investigating detectives. Declan Gavin, 20, a senior member of the gang was released after two days of questioning without being charged because he wasn't actually in the room with the drugs when Gardaí entered. The other two junior members of the gang, who were in the room, were charged with possession of cocaine and ecstasy with intent to supply. Although there is no evidence to suggest Gavin was an informer he was immediately labelled a \\"rat\\" by some gang members. This resulted in the gang splitting into two rival factions with Freddie Thompson, from Loreto Road in Maryland, leading one group and Brian Rattigan, from Cooley Road in Drimnagh, leading the other.  First murders  The first victim of the feud was Declan Gavin who was murdered in August 2001. He was stabbed to death outside an Abrakebabra fast food restaurant in Crumlin by a masked man who escaped in a getaway car driven by an accomplice. The next killed was Joseph Rattigan, 18, brother of gang leader Brian. He was shot dead on Cooley Road in Drimnagh in July 2002. In 2003 Brian Rattigan was arrested for shooting at Gardaí in their patrol car as they pursued the car Rattigan was travelling in. Although Rattigan received a 13-year prison sentence for this incident, he continued to control the gang from his prison cell. Paul Warren, 24, who was a suspect in Joseph Rattigan's murder, was shot dead in a public house in Newmarket Square in February 2004. While Warren was drinking, two masked and armed men came into the pub, one stood at the front door guarding customers, while the other chased Warren in to the toilets and shot him twice, once in the face. Brian Rattigan was suspected of organizing the hit from prison using a mobile phone.  2005-2007  John Roche, 25, from Crumlin and a suspect in the Warren hit, was shot dead as he walked to his apartment in Kilmainham in March 2005. There were three killings in two days in November 2005 beginning with Darren Geoghegan, 26, from Drimnagh, and Gavin Byrne, 30, from Crumlin. Both men, who were senior members of the Thompson faction, were shot dead as they sat in a Lexus car in Firhouse after being lured to a meeting. Two days later Noel Roche, a brother of John, was shot dead as he sat in traffic on Clontarf Road. His driver escaped unharmed. Wayne Zambra, 21, was shot dead as he sat in his car on Cameron Street in August 2006. A month later Gary Bryan, 31, was shot dead as he worked on a car outside his girlfriend's house in Walkinstown. Both men were part of the Rattigan faction. Three months later in December 2006, Eddie McCabe, 21, was tortured and beaten to death after he was abducted by Rattigan gang members. His mutilated body was dumped in a lane way in Inchicore. On 5 October 2007 Brian Downes, 40, and Edward Ward, 24, were shot dead outside a car dealership garage owned by Downes in Walkinstown. Gardaí suspect Downes, who provided false number plates and untraceable cars used in gangland murders and who had been arrested in connection with John Roche's murder, was the intended target and Ward, who had no connection to the feud, was killed to prevent him recognising the killer. Edward Ward was an innocent victim who left a wife and two daughters behind. There has been no convictions for this murder.  2008 onwards  Shay O'Byrne, 27, was shot dead in front of his girlfriend (Brian Rattigan's sister) by a masked gunman outside their home in Tallaght in March 2009. There was a grenade attack on the home of a Thompson gang member on Knockarea Avenue in Drimnagh in June 2008. Despite extensive damage to the front of the house, there were no injuries to the five adults and one child inside at the time. Gardaí suspect the attack was linked to two other shootings days previously, one where a grandmother in her 50s was shot and injured in the shoulder. In July 2009, Anthony Cannon, 26, from Robert Street in the south inner city, was shot several times in the head in front of women and children at St. Mary's Avenue in Ballyfermot, west Dublin. His killer escaped on a motorcycle with an accomplice. Cannon, who was a senior member of the Rattigan gang, was wearing a bullet proof vest when he died and was a suspect in over a dozen serious incidents linked to the feud in the year before his death. Brian Rattigan was convicted of murdering Declan Gavin after a trial in December 2009. He was sentenced to life in prison to add to the 13-year sentence he got for shooting at Gardaí in 2003. With the killing of Cannon and Rattigan's murder conviction, it had been hoped by those in the local community that the feud would end, with Thompson's rivals appearing to have more or less admitted defeat. However two killings in as many days brought the feud back to media attention. Gerard Eglington, 27, was shot dead in front of his 11-year-old step-daughter and infant son in Portarlington, County Laois, on 24 September 2012 after a gunman entered his home. The next day Declan O'Reilly, 34, who had survived a previous attempt on his life, was shot dead in front of his young son as they walked along South Circular Road in Dublin. Gardaí suspect both murders were ordered by a close associate of Freddie Thompson.  Current situation  On 13 February 2013 Brian Rattigan was convicted of running a drugs network from his prison cell in Portlaoise prison and given an additional 17-year sentence. He was linked to 5 kg of heroin found in a house in Walkinstown through messages found on a mobile phone in his cell. None of Rattigan's men were in court to support him when he was convicted and his gang has all but dissolved. Freddie Thompson is currently in prison on remand awaiting trial for a serious crime. While he has been away, younger criminals, many of them teenagers, have taken over much of his turf. Thompson and Rattigan are considered \\"yesterday's men\\" by these new gangs who have been fighting their own war for control of the drug scene in the area.  Convictions  All but three of the murders remain unsolved. As well as Brian Rattigan's conviction for the Gavin murder, twenty-three-year- old Craig White was convicted of Noel Roche's murder and was given a life sentence in July 2009 after his DNA was found on a pair of gloves that were found near the abandoned getaway car. Gardaí suspect that White, who refused to talk during Garda interviews, was the driver while Paddy Doyle, who was killed in Spain in 2008, was the gunman. Garrett O'Brien (35) and Eugene Cullen (30) were convicted after separate trials, and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Shay O'Byrne in 2009.

Magnus photographed in later life Sir Philip Magnus, 1st Baronet (7 October 1842 – 29 August 1933) was a British educational reformer and politician, who represented the London University constituency as a Unionist Member of Parliament from 1906 to 1922. He had previously been appointed director of the City and Guilds of London Institute, from where he helped oversee the creation of a modern system of technical education in the United Kingdom. He was married to the writer and teacher Katie Magnus, and was father of the publisher Laurie Magnus. Laurie predeceased him, and on his own death in 1933 he was succeeded in the baronetcy by Laurie's eldest son Philip. Biography After studying at University College School and University College London, where he took first-class honours in both arts and science, Magnus chose to take up a religious career. An active member of the Reform Judaism in Britain, he spent three years studying at the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin and returned to London to take up a post as assistant rabbi at the West London Synagogue in 1866.Bailey (2004) During his time as rabbi, Magnus supplemented his income by teaching private students, which grew steadily into a regular occupation. He held a lectureship at Stockwell teacher training college, taught at University College London, and examined prospective teachers for the College of Preceptors. In 1880, he finally left his rabbinical work to become director of the newly formed City and Guilds of London Institute. He oversaw the rapid growth of the institute, focusing his attentions on the technical education departments, of which he became Superintendent in 1888; he would hold this post until retiring in 1915.Bailey (2004); Who Was Who Outside of the Institute, Magnus was influential in setting national education policy; he sat on the Samuelson Commission (the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction) of 1884, and for his work here was knighted in 1886. The Commission's report led to the Technical Instruction Act 1889, which supported local authorities in creating technical schools around the country. He encouraged the reform of primary and secondary state education in London, and helped oversee the merger of the City and Guilds Institute into the newly formed Imperial College of Science and Technology. In the 1906 general election, he was elected to Parliament as a Liberal Unionist, representing the London University constituency. He narrowly defeated Sir Michael Foster, a prominent Cambridge physiologist, by twenty- four votes. Foster was a Liberal, who on his initial election had joined the Liberal Unionists and supported Salisbury's Conservative government; however, he later crossed the floor to rejoin the Liberals, in large part due to his opposition to the 1902 educational reforms.Romano (2004) Magnus was re-elected in 1910, and on the demise of the Liberal Unionists in 1912 joined the Conservative Party. He held the seat in 1918 – where he defeated Sidney Webb – but did not seek re-election in 1922. In retirement, he continued to sit as a member of the Senate of the University of London, and chaired the council of the Royal Society of Arts. He was a governor of the Northampton Institute and Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and a vice-president of the Anglo-Jewish Association, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and Jews' College. In 1917, he co-founded the anti-Zionist League of British Jews. He died in 1933 and is buried at Golders Green Jewish Cemetery.

The apartments were originally built as public housing for the victims of a great fire, converted later into hotel premises. Formerly Ramada Hotel and then Merit Antique Hotel, the complex is currently a five star hotel of the Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts chain named Crowne Plaza Istanbul Old City. History In 1918, a great fire destroyed numerous buildings in wide areas at the old city of Istanbul, mainly in neighborhoods of Cibali, Altımermer and Fatih. Plans were made to construct residential buildings at least for a part of low-income fire victims, who had lost their houses. Renowned Turkish architect Kemaleddin Bey (1870-1927) was commissioned with the task to develop apartments in Laleli quarter. Ottoman Ministry of Foundations donated the empty ground of Koska Madrasa, which belonged to Laleli Mosque's Complex, and was partly destroyed by the 1894 Istanbul earthquake and then burnt down in 1911. The construction, financed by voluntarily donations from residents of Istanbul, began in 1919 and was completed in 1922. Styled in Turkish neoclassical architecture, the low-rise structure consists of a ground floor, a mezzanine and two floors topped with a roof floor reaching a total height of . The complex consists of four symmetrical, equal-sized quadratic buildings separated by atriums, all forming a block. Tayyare Apartments were the first modern buildings constructed in reinforced concrete, and the first public housing project within the walled old city of Istanbul. There were a total of 124 apartments with three or five rooms and covered terrace, 25 shops and in addition laundrette for common use, as well as coal bunkers for each apartment. The building complex was called initially \\"Harikzedegân Apartmanları\\" meaning \\"Apartments for Fire Victims\\". The completion of the complex coincided with the ending of the Ottoman Empire, and the designated lodgers could not move in. After the apartments were transferred to the Turkish Aeronautical Association (formerly , now , THK) in the newly founded Republic, they were renamed \\"Tayyare Apartmanları\\" meaning \\"Aircraft Apartments\\". The apartments were used for residential purposes only until 1985. Tayyare Apartments are situated between Beyazıt Square and Aksaray in Ordu Cad. next to the 18th-century Laleli Mosque. Redevelopment as hotel In 1985, the historical complex was leased to Göksel Marine company for a term of twenty years to be converted into a three-star hotel. However, the lessee could not afford the financial resources needed, and formed a partnership with the tourism company Net Holding. After spending US$27 million, Net Holding redeveloped Tayyare Apartments transforming them into a five-star hotel. The project was led by architect Erdem Ertunga. The company operated the premises in the beginning under the name \\"Ramada Hotel\\" and later as \\"Merit Antique Hotel\\". In November 2000, Net Holding purchased the shares of Göksel Marine and became the sole operator. Due to financial problems with Net Holding, however, the THK revoked the lease in 2003, four years before the legal termination of the contract. The THK argued with financial loss due to the payment of the annual lease in Turkish currency that was affected by devaluation under high-inflation in those years. In the beginning, annual lease of 400 million were equivalent to US$760,000. However, in 2003 the equivalent value in US dollars were only 30,000, while the lessee was earning at the same time US$800,000 from the sublease of twelve stores under the hotel, claimed the THK. Net Holding was forced to move out in August 2004. In November 2005, the textile company Naz Giyim became the new lessee at an annual payment of US$3 million for a lease period of twenty years. Crowne Plaza Istanbul Old City Naz Textile signed an agreement with Crowne Plaza chain to rebrand the hotel, and began with renovation work. It was planned to open the hotel end 2006. Meanwhile, the company built a new hotel of the Crowne Plaza chain in the historical Sultanahmet quarter, and transferred the leasing rights on the Tayyare Apartments to the company Dorak Tour for €25 million, reportedly. On May 26, 2008, after standing vacant almost three years long for renovation work, the complex opened its doors in three of the four buildings, rebranded as the five-star Crowne Plaza Hotel Istanbul Old City. Having a total floor area of , the hotel consists of 265 deluxe rooms, a VIP lounge, executive boardrooms, three meeting rooms, atrium lounges for 70-150 people, two restaurants of Turkish and international cuisine and a health club.

He was the founder and CEO of Electionmall Technologies, a non- partisan company that offers technology products and services tailored to those running for political office. Singh became known as the first U.S. cadet to graduate from a military academy with a turban. His 1998 bid for the Illinois Legislature made him the first Asian to ever run for the position. Singh has been honored with numerous awards and recognitions including the Sikh in Media Award in 2011, and a Rising Star, a prestigious honor given in politics. Early life and education Singh was born and raised in Aurora, Illinois, to U.S. immigrant parents who came to the United States from India in the 1960s. He was raised in Sikh faith, in which wearing a turban and full beard are basic religious constituents. At the age of 14, Singh attended Marmion Military Academy in Aurora, Illinois where he was not allowed to wear his turban. Singh was allowed to wear his turban but was not allowed to participate in Army drills with his turban. He was expelled from the military school after he refused to remove his turban. Singh’s parents went to U.S. Representative J. Dennis Hastert, to draft legislation where discrimination based on turbans would be declared illegal. He then graduated from Marmion Military Academy in 1990. Shortly after entering the academy, co-sponsored legislation introduced by Senator Paul Simon and Congressman Dennis Hastert and later signed by President Ronald Reagan, allowed him to graduate with his turban and with full honors as a 2nd Lieutenant. His mother fought for the legislation which also allowed Jews to wear religious headdress while attending military academies. He graduated from the academy with full honors as a brevet 2nd Lieutenant in the Illinois National Guard. Singh attended Valparaiso University, a Lutheran university located in Valparaiso, Indiana. Singh got his Bachelor of Science degree from Valparaiso University, where he was elected to be the first Sikh-American student body president. During his time as student body president, he spoke at the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago. He went on to Northwestern University where he earned his master's degree in Political Science in 1995 and he completed his second Master Degree at Liberty University in 2019. He completed his Master Degree in Political Science in nine months and wrote a dissertation on Asian American political participation and talked about the challenges that Sikh-Americans had to deal with by being mislabeled and by not being considered Asian- Americans. In 2019, Singh acquired his Ph.D. in social media and technology from Ashford University and finished his studies at MIT, Duke, and Harvard in digital marketing and leadership programs. Political career Ravi Singh at his graduation from Marmion Academy in Aurora, Illinois. After graduating from Northwestern, he worked as a legislative assistant to then Illinois Lt Governor Bob Kustra. A year later he went to work for Illinois State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka and served as liaison to the Asian Pacific American community. In 1997, at 25, he ran for the State Legislature for the Illinois’ 42nd Assembly District. The district's population was only 2% Asian-American at the time. Singh gained the support of the owner of the local Domino’s Pizza restaurant. Singh lost the election and attributes the loss partially to his refusal to remove his turban during the campaign. He was quoted in the Outlook Magazine as stating, “if I do that, I will not be true to my faith and my work…If I give up my identity and values, I’ll not be Asian or an American. I’ll be nobody.” Even though he did not win the elections, he landed on the position of administrative assistant for the Illinois Lt. Governor and State Treasurer. Singh was a member of EAPC (European), the AAPC (American) Associations of Political Consultants, and IAPC (International), where he is part of the board members. He has published articles for George Washington University, and these revolve around Campaign Relationship Management and Voter Space. He has served as a technology adviser for Juan Manuel Santos, the former Colombian President. He was invited to the 10th annual Art and Science of Public Affairs conference to discuss U.S politics. He has also served as an advisor to Enda Kenny, Prime Minister of Ireland, and has assisted over 9 heads of states get elected using his software.  Tech entrepreneur  In 2000, Singh founded ElectionMall™ Technologies, Inc., a non-partisan technology company headquartered in Washington, D.C. It was the first company in the industry to send a unique electronic card over the Internet known as eYardSigns. The company has campaigned for George W. Bush and the Democratic National Committee in Presidential Campaign in 2000. Singh has expanded his company in Latin America, Asia, and Europe. The company also acquired sponsorship funds from Microsoft and together created Campaign Cloud. Campaign Cloud, powered by Microsoft, is a campaign dashboard for all types of campaigns that use advanced cloud computing technologies. In 2007, nearly 640 campaigners signed up with the company. ElectionMall™ has an international patent and was the first to introduce digital certificates in elections. Election influence and criminal conviction Singh founded ElectionMall Technologies in 1999. He realized after his loss in the Illinois State Legislature election that there was no company offering candidates any type of technology solution for fighting campaigns digitally. In a 2004 cover story for USA Weekend, Singh was quoted as saying, “we want the mother running for school board to have the same tools as a senator.” ElectionMall, founded in 1999 a non-partisan campaign technology company in Washington, D.C., hit the headlines when a criminal complaint against its Founder and CEO Singh was unsealed, revealing that the Justice Department had charged him with illegally helping a foreigner to influence the election process in San Diego during the 2012 and 2013 election cycles through an independent political action committee. Singh was arrested January 17, 2014, and released on bail four days later. On September 9, 2016, a Federal Jury found Singh guilty on 4 felony counts related to a conspiracy to make contributions in a U.S. election on behalf of a foreign national. He later appealed the case to the Appellate court but still could face 15 months in USA federal prison. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison and was quoted as saying \\"I’ve always wanted to serve my country, now I can’t even vote\\" ElectionMall has closed operations since December 2016 due to the ongoing cost of the litigation. Personal life Singh is a practicing Sikh. Singh is a resident of Aurora, Illinois. He is a member of the Chicago area Sikh community.

Roosevelt on September 1 of that year. The act effectively prohibited the ownership of reindeer herds in Alaska by non-Native Americans. The act was intended to provide for Alaskan natives and to allow them to establish a self-sustaining industry. Authority to promulgate rules regarding the ownership and maintenance of reindeer herds was delegated to the Bureau of Indian Affairs via the Secretary of the Interior, who banned most transactions to non-natives. The act was modeled in part on Norwegian and Swedish policies on the ownership of reindeer by the Sami people of Lapland. Many Sami had arrived in Alaska to manage the reindeer in the 1930s. The Alaskan Sami were required to sell their herds to the government, and many left Alaska after doing so. For fifty years the Reindeer Act maintained a native and government monopoly in live reindeer in Alaska. By 1989 the regulations were challenged in court, resulting in a legal distinction between reindeer imported after 1937 by non-Natives and the Native herds. Between 1937 and 1940, the herd population declined drastically as reindeer joined native herds of caribou or were lost on the range. A 1997 decision opened ownership to non-natives.

It is one of Stravinsky's most recorded works for piano.  Composition  After settling in Hollywood, Stravinsky was unable to bring the money he earned from his royalties of his works in Europe to America, due to copyright issues and ambiguities. When he found himself with financial difficulties, he decided to write new compositions entirely in America in order to exploit them, with the exclusive intention of making money. Tango, which was the first work entirely written in America, is one of those works.  Analysis  One of the most rhythmically regular works by Stravinsky, the Tango consists of bars in four-bar phrase structures. However, this Tango does not follow the rhythmic logic used in Argentinian Tangos: syncopation is almost never used on the last beat of every bar, but it is used on the second instead. This provides the work with a distinctive atmosphere. Unlike some of Stravinsky's post-European works, the Tango is a tonal work. It is in the key of D minor, and modulates to D major in the central trio-like section.  Arrangements  Stravinsky's Tango has been rewritten and rearranged many times either by Stravinsky himself, by fellow musicians or by other musicians, especially after his death. Here is a list of arrangements in which Stravinsky took part: * The first arrangement was a 1941 orchestra version for three flutes, three clarinets, two oboes, two bassoons, three saxophones, two horns, three trumpets, three trombones, one tuba, percussion, piano, guitar, violins, violas, cellos and double basses. Even though it was purportedly written by Felix Guenther, it was eventually revised and approved by Stravinsky. It was premiered by Benny Goodman on July 1941. * The second arrangement was composed in 1953 for a very atypical ensemble: four clarinets, one bass clarinet, four trumpets, three trombones, one guitar, three violins, one viola, one cello, and one double bass. It was premiered in October 18, 1953, by fellow musician Robert Craft. * The third arrangement was written for violin and piano by American violinist Samuel Dushkin, as Stravinsky and Dushkin started performing at recitals together quite often after Stravinsky fled from Europe.

When attacked by the superior Qing army, the Dzungars formed a camel wall to defend their camp and defeated Qing assaults on their right flank, but were driven back on the left. They were able to withdraw into the wooded hills behind their camp in good order. The Qing commander, Fuquan, reported it as a victory, but was discredited by political opponents.Perdue (2005), 155 Background The Dzungar Khanate was ruled by the Oirats, who had a longtime rivalry with the Khalkha Mongols, who by the later 17th century became the remnants of the Northern Yuan dynasty. After the death of Galdan Boshugtu Khan's brother at the hands of the Northern Yuan dynasty, he attacked them, decisively defeated them, and occupied Mongolia. The remnants of the Northern Yuan dynasty submitted to the Qing dynasty in the hope of being restored as a client state. Motivated by the opportunity to gain control over Mongolia and by the threat posed to them by a strong, unified Mongol state such as the Oirats threatened to form, the Qing sent their army north to subdue the Dzungars. Battle The Qing, running low on supplies due to the complications of operating in the difficult, dry terrain of Inner Mongolia, wanted to end the war with a decisive battle as soon as possible. Their army caught up to the Dzungars at Ulan Butung, trapping them against a range of wooded hills. The Qing started the battle with an artillery bombardment, causing light casualties among the Dzungars. The Qing launched an attack on the Dzungar left flank, driving this part of the army into the hills, where it fled. To ward off attacks on the center, the Dzungars constructed a camel wall, or tuo cheng, by lining up 10,000 camels which they used for pack animals, roping their legs together, and firing between them.Encyclopedia of Classic Warfare,pg. 229,2011. Intimidated by this, the Qing attack slid off to the right, only for their cavalry and artillery to become bogged down in wet ground. The Dzungars now disassembled their camel wall and withdrew into the hills unharassed.Perdue (2005), 155 Map showing the Dzungar-Qing wars with the location of Battle of Ulan Butung Aftermath The Dzungars escaped intact, inflicting more casualties than they had suffered, enabling them to fight the Qing successfully several more times.

After many decades of producing different car and truck models under the Zastava brand, the company ceased all vehicle production in 2008. Since then, a new company, Fiat Automobili Srbija has taken over the Zastava Automobiles facilities, after extensive reconstruction and renovation. Overview *1853: Founded as a cannon-casting plant *1930: Ford trucks assembled for the Yugoslav Army *1955: Assembly starts on Fiat models such as the 1100B, 1400 and 600 *1965: 6,000 cars exported to Poland *1980: Fiat 127-based Zastava 102 debuts, becomes the Yugo 45, only Zastava sold in the US *1988: Debut of Zastava’s first proprietary model, the Giugiaro-designed Florida hatchback *1989: Production peaks at 180,950 units *1992: Trade sanctions imposed by UN halt exports and disrupt parts supply *1995: End of trade sanctions *1999: NATO aircraft bomb plant during the war in Kosovo Initially, Zastava was widely known for its locally built versions of the Fiat 128 and Fiat 600. During the 1980s, Zastava sold its compact cars in North and South America and Western Europe under the \\"Yugo\\" brand. Its final model, the Yugo Sana, was styled by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro and launched in 1988, but its production was cut short by the Yugoslav wars. By the same time the Yugo brand had disappeared from most Western markets by 1991. and 1992. In 1999, the factory was damaged by NATO bombing during the Kosovo War. The post-Yugoslav era has been difficult for Zastava, just as most of the other major companies based in Serbia, which suffered from hyperinflation, international sanctions, and economic mismanagement. As a result, production almost stopped and the company failed to introduce new models for a long time. In September 2005, the company signed a new agreement with Fiat to produce a version of the 2003 model Fiat Punto for the Balkans under the name Zastava 10, with a capacity of 16,000 units annually. In December 2007, Serbia announced that Zastava would be privatized in April 2008. History Promotional material depicting the Zastava factory. Particular emphasis was added on making clear Yugoslavia was not aligned with the USSR. =Origins= Zastava 750 The roots of Zastava lay in the 1851 founding in Kragujevac of the Vojno-Tehnicki Zavod (Military Technical Institute). The institute developed a cannon foundry division in 1853, becoming a military vocational school in March 1854. During the 1880s, Zastava also begin with the production of firearms. At the end of the 19th century the cannon foundry changed its name to the Military Engineering Works. The firm rapidly expanded its production program and the complexity and quality of its products. In 1904, within the company, a section dedicated to automobiles is inaugurated. Beside repair services, certain car parts are also manufactured. In 1939 it begins assembling Chevrolet military trucks. Production came to a halt in 1941 with the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and by then, 400 trucks came out of the factory which consisted of a working force of 12,000 men. =1950s= After World War II, the plant was renamed Zavodi Crvena Zastava (\\"Red Flag Factories\\"). In a referendum held on August 26, 1953, 96% of the employees of then Zavodi Crvena Zastava voiced their desire to produce automobiles. That year, 162 Willys Jeeps would leave Kragujevac lines. On August 12, 1954 Zastava signed a cooperation agreement with Fiat. Three months later, Kragujevac began assembling the Fiat 1400, 1100 B, and AR-55 Campagnola. Fiat 1400 was Zastava's first assembled automobile, but Fića Zastava's licence built version of Fiat 600 is its iconic historical brand. 923,487 of Zastava 750 were produced over a span of 30 years, with several different engines and in various equipment levels, from October 18, 1955 through November 18, 1985. Total vehicle production in 1955 was 1,044 and by 1958 it had risen to 3,596. During 1957 and 1958 Zastava established a supplier network. Zastava outsourced engine manufacture to Rakovica-based engine manufacturer 21. Maj (DMB). =1960s= Zastava's annual production climbed to 13,719 units in 1960. The company entered the new decade with a replacement for the 1400: Fiat's 1100, shown in Geneva as the successor to the 1100 B. With the advent of the 1961 Fiat 1300/1500 came Zastava's 1300/1500 series, produced as both sedans and wagons. With all-around disc brakes, rear- wheel drive and up to 72 horsepower, the \\"tristać\\" was Yugoslavia's favorite upmarket car. Today, many across the former Yugoslavia recall the 1300 as Zastava's best automobile ever: the Jugoslovenski Mercedes as they call it. 201,160 copies of the 1300 and 1500 were produced from 1961 through December 20, 1979. The Fića had started life as the 633 cc Fiat 600, designed by legendary Fiat engineer Dante Giacosa. In 1962, Zastava began production of the Fiat 600D, badged Zastava 750, boasting an 767 cc engine capable of propelling the car to . The floorpan of the 1300/1500 was used as the basis for the Polski Fiat 125p, which was produced by Polish FSO from Zastava CKD kits. The 125p was created by mating the body of the Fiat 125 to the mechanicals (engines, gearbox, transmission and suspension) of the 1300 and 1500. On the Yugoslav market, the 125p was known as the Zastava 125PZ. 1965 marked the official beginning of Zastava exports, with 6,000 cars sent to Poland. In 1967, Zastava produced about 52,000 trucks and passenger cars; in 1968, 53,000. Zastava in this decade signed a new contract expanding production and technological cooperation with Fiat. A $10 million investment pushed annual capacity to 85,000, with plans in place to reach 130,000 units within a five-year period. In 1969, the Zastava Kamioni (Zastava Trucks) division split from Zastava Automobili and began producing Italy's Om trucks, rated for between 2.5 and 4 tons. Today, Zastava Kamioni continues to make trucks through a partnership with Iveco. =1970s= 1976 Zastava 101 (from Kragujevac, sold as Zastava 1100 in Czechoslovakia) In 1970, Zastava rolled out the 750M, fitted with a new 767 cc engine boasting a thermostat-controlled pressurised cooling system. In the beginning of the seventies Zastava made arrangement with Fiat to produce Zastava 101 (4 cyl, 1116 cc OHC, 55 hp, front wheel drive), which was based on Fiat 128. It had restyled rear panel and resembled a hatchback body style. This 3 and 5 door variant of Fiat 128 was specific to Zastava and was never released elsewhere by Fiat. It was said that model 101 should be produced in Yugoslavia for both Yugoslav and Italian market, and vice versa, in the Italian market would have been sold under the marque Innocenti. It was soon nicknamed Stojadin as a pun on sto jedan (101) (Stojadin is a male name, although folk etymology also associates it with sto jada, \\"a hundred woes\\", due to the poor performance and assembling). In spite of this negative record, the car was a good seller in the domestic market as there was a virtual monopoly. Yugoslavs used to buy it because of its moderate price, simple mechanics, cheap spare parts and low maintenance cost compared to other cars assembled in Yugoslavia. In 1979, Zastava 750S – (Special) was released which offered updated interior controls and switches, a new steering wheel and a sportier engine which raised the car's top speed to . A 1989 Zastava 311 (Zastava Skala) in the UK =1980s= In 1980, the Zastava 850 was launched, with a 848 cc engine propelling it to and a fully synchronized transaxle. Production of the 750 and 850 continued through 1985 in L, LE and SC versions. In the mid-seventies, Zastava management decided to develop a new model, still based on the same Fiat engine. It was originally to be known as Zastava 102, but the name was dropped in 1981 and the car released as Yugo 45. It was styled by Zastava with some help from Fiat engineers. It was a shortened Fiat 128 and it followed the style of the Fiat 127 and Autobianchi A112 but with a more square appearance. Several variants were made, with 903 cc, 1116 cc, and 1301 cc engines. Zastava 128 The Yugo, the only Zastava to be marketed in the United States In 1981, Zastava entered the British market. 811 cars were registered that year, with sales increasing to 3101 in 1982, their first full year. In 1983, export sales accounted for over a sixth of Zastava's production. Later in the 1980s, Yugo was exported to USA and at the same time it went through several modifications, most importantly the adoption of a five-speed gearbox. In the same decade, Zastava changed its branding name to Yugo and derivative models were renamed: original Zastava Yugo to Zastava Koral and Zastava 101/128 to Zastava Skala or Yugo Skala. The original numerical classification would remain unchanged for some export markets, as was the case for the United Kingdom. These were Zastava's best years in number of cars assembled; around 230,000 cars a year towards the end of decade. Zastava cars were to be sold in 70 countries at the time, with 27,000 exported to Western markets. The factory also started to make trucks, under IVECO licence. Yugo Florida from the early 1990s =1990s= Zastava military vehicles, based on the Iveco Daily In 1988 a new model was released called the Zastava Florida (known as Yugo Sana or Yugo Sana Miami, in some countries). Its exterior was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, with a body shape similar to a Fiat Tipo (1988) or Citroën ZX (1991). In the early 1990s, Zastava was affected greatly by the Balkan Crisis. The factory production became unstable because of a problem with supplies. Exports were impossible during those years, because of trade sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia. As a result, its cars disappeared from most foreign markets after 1992. Production stopped in 1993, even though there was a waiting list for Yugo cars. Between 1992 and 1995, it was under UN sanctions, and then between 1998 and 2000, it was under EU and US sanctions. As a result, many Zastava subsidiaries abroad were forced to cease trading, such as Zastava (GB) Ltd. in the United Kingdom and Yugo Cars in the United States. In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombed the factory in Kragujevac, Serbia because Zastava Arms was a major military supplier to the Serb government. Some of the car manufacturing buildings were damaged and numerous workers were injured. =2000s= After the war, there were trade talks with Hungarian firms to assemble Yugos in Hungary, but no agreement was reached because of the Yugoslavian partner's hesitation. However, Zastava Trucks were assembled in Hungary, near Pécs, with IVECO engines. Yugos were facelifted and new versions are introduced in the Belgrade International Motor Show in 2002. The new Zaatava Koral IN had a 1,1l 55HP engine with Bosch electronic injection, the transmission designed by Porsche, slightly new internal and external design, improved safety, and many extra details which were missing from former models. Koral In also have Peugeot 1,1l 60HP engine. The new generation of Yugo was granted a FIA certificate, so it was in compliance with European standards. In October 2000, Vojislav Koštunica became the new president of Yugoslavia (also a Yugo Koral owner) and soon after the sanctions against the country were lifted the exports resumed. The production had fallen to a mere 9 percent of its pre-1990 230,000 vehicles annual capacity, with exports to around 4000 vehicles. The new Yugoslav government embarked on a $50 million reorganization effort in cooperation with the World Bank, which resulted in mass layoffs, aiming to privatize the company. A new prototype for the Yugo Florida, known as the Florida 2.0, was made, equipped with the same engine as in the Fiat Bravo 2.0. =Cancelled project: Zastava Motor Works= In 2002, the American entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin, who had previously imported Yugo into the United States, signed a deal with Zastava to reintroduce the company's products into America. Bricklin's intention was to sell the cars for less than $10,000 under the brand name ZMW (as in Zastava Motor Works) which in the United States would be pronounced Zee-M-W. Even though a website proclaiming the brand's arrival was produced by Bricklin's company, by 2006 his intentions had switched to importing products from Chinese car maker Chery instead. Also there were produced some unknown models from the beginning of the 1990s and after 2000 as the respond of new market demands. Such models were:Zastava (Yugo) canceled prototypesRetrieved: April 2015 Yugo GV Turbo (90's), Yugo Electra (90's), Zastava Koral In (euro- concept), Zastava Globus Koral In (electromobile), Zastava Florida Caravan, Zastava Florida Sedan. =2005–2008= Zastava 10 Zastava automobiles have been sold and exported in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Macedonia, Greece, Bulgaria, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Ecuador, Tunisia, Poland, and Egypt (where Zastava cars were produced under the marque of the state owned Nasr car company). CEO of Zastava cars Zoran Radojević has declared that the company has received offers from African countries for technology transfer. It is believed that Congo was interested in starting production of the Zastava Florida and Egypt of the Zastava 128. In October 2005, an agreement with Fiat was reached for production of the Fiat Punto by Zastava for Eastern European markets, which would be commercialed as the Zastava 10. The Koral IN L, with a fuel injected 1.1 L Peugeot engine, met the European Union safety standards in a test supervised by the German Technischer Überwachungsverein (Technical Monitoring Association). This was seem as a chance to pave the way for export to EU countries. The Zastava 10, based on the Italian Fiat Punto Mark 2b, was the last Zastava's most modern car before this factory was taken by Fiat. Optional features included dual front airbags and air conditioning, as well as power windows. Although the Zastava 10 was Zastava's newest and best model at that time, it faced fierce competition in its home market against cars like the Volkswagen Polo. However, it had some advantages over many of its rivals, including price. As of December 2007, Zastava 10 could be afforded starting with €7,550 in the Serbian market. In March 2007, the Zastava 10's share of the Serbian car market was 11% and the company started exporting cars to former Yugoslav republics in the first half of 2007, and with plans to add to Bulgaria and Albania as well. Production of all Zastava cars (Yugo, Skala 101 and Florida) ceased by November 20, 2008. After that day, the only car in production was to be Zastava 10 which has had its front part slightly modified and its name was changed to Punto Classic. In addition to the Punto Classic (ex-Zastava 10), Zastava was negotiating with Fiat for the production rights to another model not yet in production, a C-segment sedan, codenamed Project D200, to be manufactured for Fiat by Zastava and/or Tofaş of Turkey. It was considered to compete with the Dacia Logan. =2008 shutdown and bankruptcy= Fiat Group Automobiles (FGA) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Serbian government for the acquisition of Zastava's Kragujevac plant on 7 May 2008. The memorandum of understanding foresees a new company being set up in which the Italian group would have a 67% of stake and the Serbian government acquiring 33% of stake in the new company. A new company was named Fiat Automobili Srbija. The new company would make a total investment in the region of 700 million euros, with the government contributing 200 million euros to this. The Zastava plant would produce two new Fiat models, rejecting previous reports the plant could produce the 500 compact city car. The last Zastava branded car rolled out of the factory on 21 November 2008. In May 2017, Group Zastava Vehicles, consisted of Zastava Automobiles, Zastava Trucks, Zastava INPRO and Zastava Special Automobiles, filed for bankruptcy before the Economic Court in Kragujevac. Zastava automobiles company and its subsidiaries are in bankruptcy procedure and currently exists as in Serbian: \\"AKCIONARSKO DRUŠTVO ZA HOLDING, KONSALTING I MENADŽMENT POSLOVE GRUPA ZASTAVA VOZILA KRAGUJEVAC - U STEČAJU.\\" Former models list Fiat Punto Classic (2008–2011) Vehicles produced by the Zastava factory in Kragujevac, Serbia: * Fiat Campagnola – 1953–1962. 9,089 built without modification. * Fiat 1400 – 1954–1961, without modification. * Fiat 1100R – thousands produced. * Fiat 1800 - 613 produced examples between 1960 and 1962. * Zastava 750 (later 850), nicknamed \\"Fića\\", 1955–1985. 923,487 produced with some modification. * Fiat 615 – medium truck produced by Zastava Kamioni from 1957–?. 36,000 built. * Zastava 620B - medium truck crew cab produced by Zastava Kamioni from 1962–1976. * Fiat 1300/1500 – 1962–1979. 201,160 without modification. * Fiat 850 – A modified/stretched FIAT 600D passenger compact car thousands produced. * Fiat-OM 40 – 1969–1980s A 12 t lorry based on the original 1970s OM 40 with Fiat truck engine and some with 4X4 for the army. * Zastava Skala – Fiat 128 based with many body modifications. 1971–2008. 1,273,532 built.

Bartlett served as the First Lady of Oklahoma during the administration of her husband, Governor Dewey F. Bartlett from 1967 to 1971. Ann Bartlett then became actively involved in state and national campaigns for Republican presidential candidates during the 1970s and 1980s. Early life Ann Bartlett was born Ann Smith on November 9, 1920, in Seattle, Washington to parents, Edgar and Joan Smith. Smith was raised in Seattle and attended both Seattle University and the University of Washington. Smith met her future husband, Dewey Bartlett, originally of Ohio, while visiting Doheny Park, California, to care for her grandmother. They both attended the same Marine officers' USO party on Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The couple were engaged just three weeks and three days later. Bartlett left for eighteen months soon after to serve as a Marine Corp Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber pilot in the Pacific Theater during World War II. The couple married at a ceremony in San Juan Capistrano, California, on April 2, 1945. First Lady In the mid-1940s, Bartlett moved with her husband to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Dewey Bartlett took a position with his father's company, Keener Oil Co., operated by his brother, Dave Bartlett. Ann Bartlett worked as a homemaker during this era, but also took on roles as a family and campaign adviser as her husband entered politics. Bartlett was elected as Oklahoma's second Republican governor and took office in 1967. She took on some of the traditional positions as First Lady of Oklahoma. She promoted literacy and the arts. In 1970, she became the chairwoman of the Oklahoma's National Library Week Committee, advocating on behalf of state libraries. She served as First Lady until January 1971. Bartlett was elected to the United States Senate in 1972, serving one term until 1979. Bartlett left the Senate in January 1979 and died from cancer March 1, 1979. Political campaigns and philanthropy Bartlett established her own active political career following her husband's death. Her political resume extended to state and national Republican presidential campaigns. She served as the chairwoman of the Oklahoma state presidential campaign of Senator Howard Baker in 1980. Bartlett later served as the head of Seniors for Reagan, a national arm of the campaign of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign which focused on senior voters. She also supported numerous Tulsa-based nonprofits and other groups, including the League of Women Voters and the Family and Children's Services. Death Ann Bartlett died on January 26, 2013, at the age of 92. She was survived by her three children, Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., Joan C. Atkinson, and Michael H. Bartlett. She was predeceased by her first husband, former Senator Bartlett, and her second husband, historian John Garrett Burke (died 1989). Her funeral was held at Christ the King Roman Catholic Church in Tulsa. ReferencesExternal links *Voices of Oklahoma interview with Ann Bartlett.

Only one was built. Design and development The P-3 was the third of a series of parasol wing, single engine, two seat light aircraft built around 1930 by the Dutch company Pander & Sons, the earlier ones being the almost identical P-1 and P-2. The P-3 differed considerably from these in its engine, fuselage, fin and undercarriage, and later in its career its accommodation. The near constant chord wing was similar to those of the earlier models and was again braced with two parallel struts from the lower fuselage longerons, assisted centrally by cabane struts. The fuselage was different; deeper and more obviously flat sided, it had rounded upper decking only. The installation of a 120 hp (90 kW) inverted Gipsy III required a notably different forward fuselage to those of the earlier models with their lower power, upright Gipsy Is. The tandem cockpits were, like those of the P-1 and P-2, placed under the mid-chord and trailing edge of the wing and were initially open but later they were enclosed under a single, long, multi-part canopy. The undercarriage was also new; each mainwheel was mounted on a hinged V-form strut from the lower fuselage longerons with a compression leg to the upper longeron. An inverted V strut, hinged to the central fuselage underside, provided lateral stability. This conventional undercarriage was completed with a tailskid. At the rear the tailplane was, as before, mounted on top of the fuselage but the revised fin had a straight, swept leading edge. The P-3 flew for the first time in late 1931 or early 1932. Only one was built. Operational history The sole P-3 was registered as PH-AIK in February 1932 in the name of a private owner. He and others flew it in the Netherlands and elsewhere, visiting the UK later that year. In May 1933 it was written off in an accident at Almelo.

His scientific experiments led to the discovery of \\"puffed rice\\", a starting point for a new breakfast cereal that was later advertised as \\"Food Shot From Guns\\". Biography=Early life and education= Anderson was born in Featherstone Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota. His parents John Anderson and Britta Maria (Gustafsdotter) Anderson were Swedish-American immigrant. He grew up in Spring Creek Valley, ten miles from Red Wing, Minnesota. He seemed destined to follow his father into farming but changed course at twenty-seven, entering the University of Minnesota in 1890 to study agriculture. As a college senior in 1894, Anderson invented a \\"self-registering balance\\" that was bought by Bausch & Lomb Optical Company. Encouraged by his instructors, Anderson earned a master's degree in plant physiology in 1897. He then traveled to Munich, Germany, in June 1895 to study with leading botanists, earning a doctorate at the University of Munich in plant physiology. A loan from his cousin, future Minnesota Governor John Lind helped fund the trip. =Puffed rice= After completing his studies, Anderson accepted a position at Clemson Agricultural College and taught in South Carolina from 1896 to 1899. In 1901 he became the Curator of the Herbarium at Columbia University, which allowed him to do research at the New York Botanical Garden. He believed that a tiny speck of free water would be found in the nucleus of a starch crystal. To prove this, he tried an experiment in December 1901. He heated starch granules that were sealed in a glass tube until they showed signs of browning. Anderson theorized the water inside each grain would turn to steam. He suspected that a reaction within the starch would occur if he broke the tube and set the steam free. The scientist smashed the glass and the resulting explosion produced a stick of pure puffed starch. Anderson's new breakfast food would make him a nationally known figure and the face of a Quaker Oats advertising campaign for almost a decade. Thorsell, Elisabeth (2009) Alexander Pierce Anderson -- The Swede who invented puffed rice (Swedish American Genealogist; Dec 2009, Vol. 29 Issue 4, p20) Retrieved January 15, 2016 Anderson traveled to Minneapolis for a meeting set up by John Lind and William C. Edgar (1856-1932), editor of Northwestern Miller magazine. Anderson knew he needed investors if he was to turn his puffing process into a usable product. A group of twenty wealthy businessman offered support. They gave him a laboratory at Minneapolis Steel and Machinery Company to experiment with his ideas. Anderson took a four-by-thirty-six-inch gas pipe and sealed it with pipe heads on each end, one removable. He placed raw rice inside and rotated the cylinder while heating it. When a gauge showed what he felt was enough pressure, Anderson used a sledgehammer to knock loose the removable head. A shower of puffed rice burst from the device. The Minneapolis backers, though interested, sold their shares of the process to Quaker Oats Company. Quaker gave Anderson a Chicago laboratory but took little interest in his discoveries. Anderson finally captured attention at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. He brought eight bronze, twenty-inch-long cylinders that appeared to many onlookers to be small cannons. Anderson loaded each \\"cannon\\" with six pounds of raw rice and applied heat. When he uncapped them, a blizzard of expanded rice showered into a two-story-high, forty-foot-wide cage. Helpers bagged the rice and sold it for a nickel to delighted onlookers. By fair's end, Anderson's team had puffed more than 20,000 pounds of rice and sold a quarter-million packages. He obtained patents on the process and started the Anderson Puffed Rice Company in 1905. American Cereal, a subsidiary the Quaker Oats Company, sold his new product as a breakfast cereal called Puffed Rice. Two years later Quaker Oats took over production. Anderson partnered with Quaker Oats and developed puffed rice and wheat products, including the cereal Quaker Crackles. Quaker Oats advertised puffed cereal as \\"Prof. Anderson's Gift\\". Quaker added Puffed Wheat to their line, proclaiming the ready-to-eat cereal as \\"The Eighth Wonder of the World\\". Later, the puffed grain would be nicknamed \\"Food Shot From Guns\\".Johnson, Frederick L. \\"Professor Anderson's 'Food Shot From Guns'\\" (Minnesota History, 59.1 Spring 2004) Retrieved January 15, 2016 =Later years= Anderson married Lydia McDougall Johnson (1876-1934) on August 11, 1898. Alexander and Lydia Anderson moved to the Red Wing area in 1915. Anderson built a laboratory on their Tower View Farm. The Andersons raised four children while he conducted research. Hedin, Lydia E., et al. (1977) Alexander P Anderson (West Saint Paul, MN: Sexton Printing, Inc.) Retrieved January 15, 2016 They also bought more land in the area; supported charities, notably the Vasa Children's Home; and endowed student scholarships.Anderson Puffed Rice Company remained in business until 1941. Over his career, Anderson conducted more than 15,000 experiments perfecting cereals and earned 25 United States patents and foreign patents. In 1943, Anderson died at the age of eighty. One of the Anderson's children, John Pierce Anderson, was married to Eugenie (Anderson) Moore who was appointed by President Harry S Truman as Ambassador to Denmark, the first woman appointed chief of mission at the ambassador level in American history. Anderson Center at Tower View  The former Tower View Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 13, 1977. The property is now the location of the Anderson Center, site of a 700 residency program for artists, writers, and scholars. The A. P.

He earned degrees in psychology and zoology, a doctorate in physiology from Ohio State University and master's degrees in Management and Library Science from University of Rochester, Adelphi College, and the University of California at Los Angeles. He was an author of books for secular humanist and rationalist publications, he also was a critic of claims of paranormal phenomena. Stein was an outspoken atheist and publicly debated Christian apologists such as Greg Bahnsen. He served as editor of the American Rationalist and was the librarian of the Center for Inquiry, which houses both the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) and the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH). Stein died of lung cancer in Buffalo General Hospital. Paranormal He published articles critical of the paranormal in the Skeptical Inquirer. His book The Sorcerer of Kings: The Case of Daniel Dunglas Home and William Crookes (1993) is a debunking of the mediumship of Daniel Douglas Home and the spiritualist claims of William Crookes. Stein suspected that Crookes was too ashamed to admit he had been duped by the medium Florence Cook or he conspired with her for sexual favors. He also suggested that Crookes had conspired with Anna Eva Fay. He noted that contrary to popular belief Home had been exposed as a fraud on several occasions.

Media scholar Jeffrey Escoffier describes Douglas' 1973 film The Back Row as the first example of homorealist gay pornographic cinema, which \\"created a synthesis of a documentary-like view (in this case focusing on the gay sexual subculture) and the more psychopolitical themes of sexual liberation.\\" Theatre scholar Jordan Schildcrout discusses Douglas' 1973 play Tubstrip, a comedy set in a gay bathhouse that ran for approximately 500 performances, as the most widely seen example of gay erotic theatre, a theatrical sub-genre in the early years of gay liberation, which offered \\"the most exuberant and affirming depictions of same-sex sexuality heretofore seen in the American theatre.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Jerry Douglas at TLAvideo.com *Grabby Awards Wall of Fame *GAYVN Awards website Tubstrip website 1935 births Living people LGBT people from Iowa American pornographic film directors Directors of gay pornographic films ","title":"Jerry Douglas (director)"},{"id":"38641032","text":"Saada Mkuya Salum (born 1975) is a Tanzanian CCM politician and a nominated Member of Parliament.

Fantastic tales In 1934, the author set out to explore Tibet, dyeing his face with iodine and oil to avoid detection in a country that was closed to foreigners at the time. Theodore Illion wrote three books about the country, Darkness over Tibet was also published in 1937 and The Tibetan Art of Healing came out in 1975. In Secret Tibet primarily focuses on the Tibetan people and their thoughts and customs; Illion enthusiastically relates tales of his encounters with nomads, bandits, lamas, and other holy men. Perhaps the most incredible chapter relays an encounter where Illion observed a miraculous healer help a traveling passerby who had been struck by a falling stone which: > \\"..tore savagely down his right arm.. tearing away the skin and inflicting a > deep flesh wound at least twenty inches in length. I am unable to say > whether [the healer] actually touched the bleeding wound or whether his hand > passed over it about an inch from it. Be that as it may, the bleeding > stopped instantly.\\" One remarkable account given in the book is the author's witnessing of a practitioner of lung-gom-pa. These \\"flying lamas\\" were supposedly capable of running with a sustained bouncing motion for several days and nights on end. They had previously been witnessed by Alexandra David-Néel, a French explorer visiting the country in 1924.Lung-gom-pa Runners of Tibet Illion says that he twice observed the lung-gom-pa at close range, describing how: > \\"..the hands and feet of the lama swung to and fro like a pendulum. The > speed at which they progressed was amazing.. ..he was in a state of trance.. > ..judging by careful examination of his footprints, the weight of his body > must have been diminished to some extent.\\" — \\"People who imagine that the > flying lamas are numerous in Tibet are mistaken.\\" Controversy Much of the text appears to mirror the work of Alexandra David-Néel, overlaid with Illion's personal musings and fantastic tales. This is a quote from David-Néel's Magic and Mystery in Tibet, (published five years previously) which recounts an earlier meeting she had with a lung-gom-pa lama: > \\"He seemed to lift himself from the ground.. His steps had the regularity of > a pendulum.. ..the traveller seemed to be in a trance.\\" These men they say, > are able to sit on an ear of barley without bending its stalk, or to stand > on the top of a heap of grain without displacing any of it. ..but I have not > myself witnessed anything like it.\\" Physician and bibliographer Jürgen C. Aschoff highly doubts Theodore Illion ever went to Tibet, or even approached the borders. Illion's books are, in his eyes, \\"truly science fiction, a figment of the imagination.\\" Aschoff finds it incredible that Illion's publications are used and cited in many scientific articles and books on Tibetan medicine, although [Illion] has \\"never mentioned one published reference or one renowned Tibetan physician in support of his vague assertions.\\"Googly Translated from Finnish Wikipedia article Bibliography ;Notes ;References * \\\\- Total pages: 348 * \\\\- Total pages: 210 * \\\\- Total pages: 117 1937 non-fiction books Travel books Tibetan Buddhist art and culture Books about Tibet ","title":"In Secret Tibet"},{"id":"38641116","text":"Umbrella holder outside a store An umbrella stand is a storage device for umbrellas and walking sticks. They are usually located inside the entrance of a home or public building, and are sometimes complemented by a hanger or mirror, or combined with a coat rack. The stand is used to hold umbrellas when they are not in use. In public spaces, their use is usually limited to rainy days when employees and visitors need to carry umbrellas. Umbrellas can be closed and placed in the stand. They are usually dropped off upon entering the building and collected when leaving the building. This is useful because wet umbrellas may cause a wet floor, which could pose a hazard of slipping. Design Household coat rack with umbrella stand in the base A domestic umbrella stand is generally an upright container, often a cylindrical tube, stored near to the entrance of a house. In addition to acting as a functional piece of furniture, they can be aesthetic objects for decoration, and are manufactured from a wide variety of materials: clay, plastic, metal, and wood. Stands in public buildings are often designed to hold greater numbers of umbrellas, and may be constructed with separate spaces for each umbrella. Stands with locks are used in Japan, to protect umbrellas from thieves. Bag dispensers An umbrella bag in use A more recent variant of the umbrella stand used in modern retailers is the umbrella bag dispenser, which allows the user to insert the umbrella into a disposable waterproof bag when entering a building, and to carry that bag with them so as not to get the floors wet. This eliminates the need for a large umbrella stand, in buildings where storage space may be at a premium.

In 2015, the newly elected President John Magufuli appointed Mwalimu as Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children. As Health Minister, she banned the importation and sale of sexual lubricants into Tanzania stating this would curb homosexuality, which is criminalized in Tanzania. This stance has been condemned by NGOs and goes against UNAIDS recommendation that providing water- based lubricants along with condoms can help curb the spread of HIV. Mwalimu has stated her support for ending underage marriage and assured activists she would table a bill in Parliament amending the laws that allow persons under the age of 18 to get married. Once the law is passed, this practice will be illegal.
