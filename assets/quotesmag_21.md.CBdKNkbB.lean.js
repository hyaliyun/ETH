Biography Purvis n√©e Forten was born in 1814 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was one of the \\"Forten Sisters\\" consisting of three of the daughters of James Forten: Sarah, Harriet Forten Purvis (1810‚Äì1875), and Margaretta Forten (1808‚Äì1875). The sisters, along with their mother, Charlotte Vandine Forten, formed the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. Sarah was a poet. She used two pen names, \\"Ada\\" and \\"Magawisca\\" as well as her own name. She is credited with writing \\"The Grave of the Slave\\" which was published in 1831 in the abolitionist newspaper the Liberator. That poem was subsequently set to music by Frank Johnson. The song was often used as an anthem at antislavery gatherings. She is also credited with writing \\"An Appeal to Woman,\\" published in the Liberator in 1834. In 1838 Sarah married Joseph Purvis with whom she had eight children. Joseph Purvis was the brother of Robert Purvis, who was the husband of Sarah's sister Harriet. She died in 1883. Misattribution of some works The pen name \\"Ada\\" was taken up by another poet, Eliza Earle Hacker (1807‚Äì1846), a Quaker abolitionist from Rhode Island. A case has been made that the two poets have been confused on occasion because, although of different races, both women were ardent abolitionists writing during the same era, on the same topic. Specifically, Ada's poem \\"Lines: Suggested on Reading 'An Appeal to Christian Women of the South' by A. E. Grimk√©,\\" was most likely written by Hacker but often attributed to Forten and included in African-American writing anthologies.

Further the concept has been developed and rigorously justified in a number of papers, and nowadays various different approaches to the definition of Lyapunov dimension are used. Remark that the attractors with noninteger Hausdorff dimension are called strange attractors. Since the direct numerical computation of the Hausdorff dimension of attractors is often a problem of high numerical complexity, estimations via the Lyapunov dimension became widely spread. The Lyapunov dimension was named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov because of the close connection with the Lyapunov exponents. Definitions Consider a dynamical system \\\\big(\\\\\\\\{\\\\varphi^t\\\\\\\\}_{t\\\\geq0}, (U\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\|)\\\\big) , where \\\\varphi^t is the shift operator along the solutions: \\\\varphi^t(u_0) = u(t,u_0), of ODE \\\\dot{u} = f({u}), t \\\\leq 0, or difference equation {u}(t+1) = f({u}(t)), t=0,1,..., with continuously differentiable vector-function f. Then D\\\\varphi^t(u) is the fundamental matrix of solutions of linearized system and denote by \\\\sigma_i(t,u) = \\\\sigma_i(D\\\\varphi^t(u)), \\\\ i = 1...n, singular values with respect to their algebraic multiplicity, ordered by decreasing for any u and t. Definition via finite-time Lyapunov dimension The concept of finite-time Lyapunov dimension and related definition of the Lyapunov dimension, developed in the works by N. Kuznetsov, is convenient for the numerical experiments where only finite time can be observed. Consider an analog of the Kaplan‚ÄìYorke formula for the finite-time Lyapunov exponents: : d_{\\\\rm KY}(\\\\\\\\{ {\\\\rm LE}_i(t,u)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n)=j(t,u) + \\\\frac{ {\\\\rm LE}_1(t,u) + \\\\cdots + {\\\\rm LE}_{j(t,u)}(t,u)}{{\\\\rm LE}_{j(t,u)+1}(t,u)|}, : j(t,u) = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{m: \\\\sum_{i=1}^m {\\\\rm LE}_i(t,u) \\\\geq 0\\\\\\\\}, with respect to the ordered set of finite-time Lyapunov exponents \\\\\\\\{{\\\\rm LE}_i(t,u)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n = \\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\ln\\\\sigma_i(t,u)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n at the point u. The finite-time Lyapunov dimension of dynamical system with respect to invariant set K is defined as follows : \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L}(t, K) = \\\\sup\\\\limits_{u \\\\in K} d_{\\\\rm KY}(\\\\\\\\{{\\\\rm LE}_i(t,u)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n). In this approach the use of the analog of Kaplan‚ÄìYorke formula is rigorously justified by the Douady‚ÄìOesterl√® theorem, which proves that for any fixed t > 0 the finite-time Lyapunov dimension for a closed bounded invariant set K is an upper estimate of the Hausdorff dimension: : \\\\dim_{\\\\rm H} K \\\\leq \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L}(t, K). Looking for best such estimation \\\\inf_{t>0} \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L} (t, K) = \\\\liminf_{t \\\\to +\\\\infty}\\\\sup\\\\limits_{u \\\\in K} \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L}(t,u) , the Lyapunov dimension is defined as follows: : \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L} K = \\\\liminf_{t \\\\to +\\\\infty}\\\\sup\\\\limits_{u \\\\in K} \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L}(t,u). The possibilities of changing the order of the time limit and the supremum over set is discussed, e.g., in. Note that the above defined Lyapunov dimension is invariant under Lipschitz diffeomorphisms. Exact Lyapunov dimension Let the Jacobian matrix Df(u_\\\\text{eq}) at one of the equilibria have simple real eigenvalues: \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_i(u_\\\\text{eq})\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n, \\\\lambda_{i}(u_\\\\text{eq}) \\\\geq \\\\lambda_{i+1}(u_\\\\text{eq}), then : \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L}u_\\\\text{eq} = d_{\\\\rm KY}(\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_i(u_\\\\text{eq})\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n). If the supremum of local Lyapunov dimensions on the global attractor, which involves all equilibria, is achieved at an equilibrium point, then this allows one to get analytical formula of the exact Lyapunov dimension of the global attractor (see corresponding Eden‚Äôs conjecture). Definition via statistical physics approach and ergodicity Following the statistical physics approach and assuming the ergodicity the Lyapunov dimension of attractor is estimated by limit value of the local Lyapunov dimension \\\\lim_{t\\\\to+\\\\infty}\\\\dim_{\\\\rm L} (t, u_0) of a typical trajectory, which belongs to the attractor. In this case \\\\\\\\{\\\\lim\\\\limits_{t\\\\to+\\\\infty}{\\\\rm LE}_i(t,u_0)\\\\\\\\}_{i}^n = \\\\\\\\{ {\\\\rm LE}_i(u_0)\\\\\\\\}_1^n and \\\\dim_{\\\\rm L}u_0= d_{\\\\rm KY}(\\\\\\\\{ {\\\\rm LE}_i(u_0)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n)=j(u_0) + \\\\frac{ {\\\\rm LE}_1(u_0) + \\\\cdots + {\\\\rm LE}_{j(u_0)}(u_0)}{{\\\\rm LE}_{j(u_0)+1}(u_0)|} . From a practical point of view, the rigorous use of ergodic Oseledec theorem, verification that the considered trajectory u(t,u_0) is a typical trajectory, and the use of corresponding Kaplan‚ÄìYorke formula is a challenging task (see, e.g. discussions in). The exact limit values of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, if they exist and are the same for all u_0 \\\\in U, are called the absolute ones \\\\\\\\{\\\\lim\\\\limits_{t\\\\to+\\\\infty}{\\\\rm LE}_i(t,u_0)\\\\\\\\}_{i}^n = \\\\\\\\{ {\\\\rm LE}_i(u_0)\\\\\\\\}_1^n \\\\equiv \\\\\\\\{ {\\\\rm LE}_i \\\\\\\\}_1^n and used in the Kaplan‚ÄìYorke formula. Examples of the rigorous use of the ergodic theory for the computation of the Lyapunov exponents and dimension can be found in.

Biography   Anarcho-syndicalist commitment  Son of an Aragonese mason, his mother died of the Spanish flu in 1918 when he was 20 months old. In 1926, he was sent to Calanda (Teruel) for free education. Shortly before the elections of February 1936, Ramon Rufat joined the Libertarian Youth. During the Fascist uprising, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, he went to Barcelona and joined the Durruti Column of Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) militiamen in their attempt to liberate Zaragoza (Aragon). In October 1936, he was a founder of The Children of the Night (\\"Los Hijos de la Noche\\"), a special group of the Servicio de Informaci√≥n Especial Perif√©rico (SIEP) on the fronts of Aragon and Catalonia. Rufat was one of the 17 members of this most select group of the Intelligence service of the Second Spanish Republic. Between October 1936 and December 1938, Rufat carried out more than 50 deep penetration missions behind the fascist lines of Aragon and Catalonia. He gathered intelligence by posing as a fascist officer, but always refusing to kill or wound anyone. He gradually built up a vast network of clandestine agents, couriers, smugglers, also exfiltrating militants and families trapped in the fascist zone. His intelligence contributed to the assassination attempts on Francisco Franco in Salamanca in January 1937 and then during the funeral of Emilio Mola in June 1937. On the Levant front, the information he provided to the Republican Army was crucial for the Zaragoza offensives (October 1936 and August 1937), the Battle of Belchite (September 1937), the Battle of Teruel (December 1937), the Aragon Offensive (March 1938) and the Battle of the Ebro (July 1938). Knowing the war lost in the fall of 1938, Rufat nevertheless refused to give up the fight. He was denounced and then captured by the Francoist troops as he crossed the Guadalaviar (Turia) in the Sierra de Albarrac√≠n on a mission at the beginning of the Catalonia Offensive on 18 December 1938.  Clandestinity and inner resistance  On 4 March 1939, Rufat was sentenced to two death sentences: one for \\"espionage\\" based on his actions, and one for \\"perversity\\" based on his political commitment. In September 1940, the Belgian Red Cross provided Spain with a food boat in exchange for a list of 100 people to be pardoned. Rufat was at the top of the list and his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. After several concentration camps (Santa Eulalia del Campo, Calataiud), interrogations, torture and mock executions, he managed to falsify his prison record and was released on parole on 10 August 1944. On the very same day, he went to the National Committee of proscribed Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), with which he had remained in contact during his imprisonment. He was immediately appointed Vice-Secretary of the , a clandestine coordinating structure that brought together the CNT, the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) and the Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth (FIJL). Rufat was also put in charge of propaganda, relaunching the clandestine publications of the internal resistance of the Libertarian Movement (ML) and CNT, in particular Solidaridad Obrera, Fragua Social, Tierra y Libertad, which had been banned. In July 1945, the CNT-ML (interior) clandestinely held its national congress in Caraba√±a (near Madrid) with many regional delegates and reaffirmed the anti-fascist line of union. This resulted in its participation in the and the appointment of Horacio Prieto and Jos√© Exposito Leiva as representatives of the CNT to the Republican government-in-exile of Jos√© Giral. This was the \\"golden age\\" of the anarchist resistance to Franco's regime, with a wide distribution of the underground press in the regions, the first major strikes in 1945 in Barcelona and then in Vizcaya, the first demonstrations, and then the resumption of urban guerrilla warfare, notably with attacks on banks. After the arrest of Sigfrido Catal√° Tineo, Rufat became secretary general of the CNT-ML (interior). He continued the underground revolutionary struggle until he was arrested alongside the whole clandestine Ninth CNT National Committee on 6 October 1945 in Madrid by the Francoist Political-Social Brigade.  \\"All of Spain is a prison\\"  Rufat was sentenced by the war council of 21 March 1947 to 20 years in prison. Interrogated and tortured in Madrid, he was then incarcerated in the prisons of Alcal√° de Henares, Yeser√≠as, Oca√±a, then 11 years at El Dueso. At the end of the 1940s, up to seven national committees of the CNT-ML (interior) were simultaneously imprisoned at the Oca√±a prison. Anarchist resistance was organized from inside Franco's prisons. Getting provisional freedom in 1958, literally 20 years after his 1938 arrest, Rufat escaped across the Pyrenees to start a new life in France.  Exile and the protection of refugees  In France, he worked for the Office for the Protection of Political Refugees (OFPRA) of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He participated in the creation of the Pol√©mica and Anthropos journals and wrote for many other French- and Spanish-language publications. When returning to Barcelona in 1976, after the death of dictator Francisco Franco, he discovered that according to the archives, he had been executed twice, in 1938 and 1940. Rufat struggled to convince the new democratic authorities that, in spite of his clandestine activities, he was still alive. This led him to devote the rest of his life to writing \\"the history of the defeated\\", in particular by collaborating with the Biblioth√®que de documentation internationale contemporaine (BDIC) at the University of Nanterre. Rufat was also an actor and writer, known for the movie Larga noche (1977). Many of his manuscripts, texts and memoirs remain unpublished although he won the Juan Garc√≠a Dur√°n Award in 1986.

Administratively, it is part of the municipality of Achstetten and has a population of 858.  Geography  Oberholzheim is located 1 km east of Achstetten and 1 km west of Bihlafingen on the country road 261. To the north-east it borders on the municipality of H√ºttisheim, part of Alb-Donau district. The village is situated on a high plateau between the valleys of the rivers Rot and Schmiehe.  History  The area of Oberholzheim has been inhabited since ancient times. A Celtic grave, believed to be dating to the second millennium BCE, and containing a Bronze Age axe, was discovered on its territory. Oberholzheim is first mentioned as Holtzheim in documents of 926 where Weissenburg Abbey is referred to as owing several farms and rights in the village. In 1275 the local church seems to have been independent from local aristocratic patronage. However, by the mid-14th century the lords of Freyberg had acquired the jus patronatus over the church. In the early 15th century the village came into the possession of several Ulm citizens and Gutenzell Abbey. The abbey also had the right to exercise low justice. The parts belonging to the Ulm citizens were sold to Spital, a charitable institution for all citizens founded in 1239, from the Free imperial city Biberach an der Riss in 1439. The rights to carry out high justice was first executed by the counts of Kirchberg but passed on to the Biberach Spital following its acquisition of parts of the village. When in 1536 Biberach introduced the Protestant reformation, Oberholzheim became Protestant as well. This meant that Catholic Gutenzell Abbey kept the responsibility for the maintenance of the church, but the instalment of Protestant clerics rested with the Protestant Spital in Biberach. During the Thirty Years' War, and in the course of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, a Catholic priest was installed in Oberholzheim in 1628, but had to abandon the parish after only four years in 1632. Up to 1803 two thirds of the village belonged to the Spital from Biberach and one third to Gutenzell Abbey. During the course of the German mediatisation and the dissolution of Gutenzell Abbey, the part of the village belonging to the abbey became property of the Bavarian counts of T√∂rring whereas the Spital property within the village was handed over to the Margraviate of Baden in 1803. Following the establishing of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 the whole of the village of Oberholzheim was incorporated into the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. On 1 March 1972 Oberholzheim was incorporated into the municipality of Achstetten.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms of Oberholzheim depicts a sword and a key, which are crossed, under a ploughshare. All three symbols are held in or and are on an escutcheon in azure. The sword and the key represent the patron saints of the local church, St Peter and Paul whereas the ploughshare refers to the agrarian history and nature of the village. The or and azure are taken from the coat of arms of Biberach indicating the historical connections with the city. Place of birth of Christoph Martin Wieland  Attractions   Parish church St Peter and Paul  A church and parish are first mentioned in the 10th century. In 1275 the church seemed to have still been affiliated to Weissenburg Abbey and already been dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Remains of an earlier structure, incorporated into the current building, are the square base of the bell tower as well as the lower parts of the choir. The church was converted into Baroque style in 1739 under the guidance of Maria Bernarda von Donnersberg, abbess of Gutenzell Abbey. None of the Baroque furnishings have, however, survived the Neo-Gothic renovation carried out in 1874. Only a Noli me tangere painting attributed to Franz Carl Stauder remains. The Neo=Gothic altar, pulpit and baptismal font were installed in 1874. The ceiling was painted by Hans Gottfried von Stockhausen in 1953 and 1954.  Tithe barn  The tithe barn was erected in 1498 on instructions from Gutenzell Abbey. The abbey had the rights of tithes in the village. The building was reconstructed in 1767 and 1768 when an extension on the western side was built including a hip roof.

Description Boronia beeronensis is an erect, many-branched shrub which grows to about high and wide with its young branches densely covered with white to yellow hairs. The leaves are linear to narrow elliptic, long and wide and lack a petiole. The lower surface of the leaf is a much paler colour than the upper surface and the edges are turned down or rolled under. Usually only one but sometimes up to three flowers are arranged on a hairy stalk up to long. The four sepals are broadly egg-shaped to triangular, long and wide. The four petals are long, wide but enlarge slightly as the fruit develop. The eight stamens are hairy. The fruit are about long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia beeronensis was first formally described in 2003 by Marco F. Duretto and the description was published in the journal Muelleria. The specific epithet (beeronensis) refers to the national park in which this species appears to be endemic. The ending \\"-ensis\\" is a Latin suffix denoting place, locality or country.

She coined the term cyberculture in 1963. She served as president of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science and The Institute for Cybercultural Research.  Early life and education  Hilton was born in Vienna to Frederick O. Hilton and Thea von Weber. She studied classics, comparative literature and mathematics at the University of Oxford. She went on to earn a PhD in electrical engineering at University of California, Los Angeles. Here she took courses in mathematics. She was a postdoctoral scholar in the Sorbonne University, the Claremont Graduate University and Columbia University.  Career  At first Hilton was optimistic that new technologies could help to eliminate poverty and cheap labour focused on repetitive tasks, but she became more wary of technology and increasingly pessimistic in the late 1960s as a result of the Vietnam War growing social unrest of that period. In 1963 Hilton created the term cyberculture. Cyberculture was defined by Hilton as \\"that way of life made possible when an entire process of production is carried out by systems of machines monitored and controlled by one computer\\". She described how, in the era of cyberculture, \\"plows pull themselves and the fried chickens fly right onto our plates\\". In the early 1960s Hilton published as series of essays entitled the Age of Cyberculture. She described how computers could someday become conscious, and that the interactions that take place in a human body could be performed by man-made circuits. Her first book, Logic, Computing Machines and automation was read by Bertrand Russell. She wrote about the need for science teachers to the dangers of modern science and technology, as well as their potential to build a new world. She maintained that a curriculum needed to be developed for the technological future. > \\"A new age is being born. In this century, humanity must prepare for the > emerging cyberculture. Never has humanity had to make so many profound > decisions in so short a time. Never has great civilisation been so > attainable. Never has harmonious balance been so remote and never has > balance been so desperately needed. The cybercultural revolution can create > a world where machine systems produce undreamed of abundance, and where > human beings live human lives, free to pursue human tasks.\\" In an article in the Michigan Quarterly Review, Hilton discussed the future of work in a world of automation. She was the first to point out that civil liberties, human rights and the economy are part of the cyberculture. She emphasised the needs for a \\"pattern for a world of leisure and abundance\\". She wrote about the need for an Ethos for the Age of Cyber Culture and for government involvement to develop a good cybercultural society. She delivered lectures on \\"The Human Spirit and the Cybercultural Revolution\\" around the United States. In 1964 Hilton founded The Institute for Cybercultural Research. The Institute for Cybercultural Research was a forum for the exchange of ideas about science and the future of work. The institute considered the immediate problems that might arise from the acceleration of technology and the need for ethics to be at the heart of new working conditions, as well as serving as a reliable source of information to government. Hilton was a signatory on The Triple Revolution, a memorandum sent to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, to share concerns about \\"the cybernation generation\\". Hilton was one of two women signatories, the other being Frances W. Herring, a Professor of Government at University of California, Berkeley who led the 1961 Women Strike for Peace. In Cybernation and Civil Rights, a chapter in The Evolving Society, Hilton and Victor Paschkis called for an evaluation of what it meant to call machines intelligent. Paschkis, a mechanical engineer and Quaker, was the founder of the Social Responsibility in Science. Hilton was described as \\"outstanding authority on computing machines and automation\\". In 1968 Hilton was made the vice president of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science. She became increasingly concerned for the underfed and under privileged in the developing world. She called for more to be done by socially conscious scientists. Hilton died in Manhattan on August 10, 2011.

In 2002, she moved from Ankara to Istanbul to pursue a professional music career, and initially worked as a vocalist in different pop and jazz groups. With B√ºlent Orta√ßgil's help she signed a contract with the production company Ada M√ºzik. In 2009, her debut studio album, Uyan, was released. She continued her music career with the release of her second studio album, Hayat, in 2010. She released the albums Sarƒ±, Sizler Hi√ß Yokken and Evim Neresi in 2012, 2014, and 2017 respectively.  Early life  Jehan Barbur, whose family live in ƒ∞skenderun, was born in Beirut as her mother believed that medical conditions in this city were more favorable. After her birth, she spent her childhood in ƒ∞skenderun, before moving to Ankara to continue her education at a university. She had been interested in music ever since she was a kid. However, due to her father's refusal to allow her to go to a conservatory, she enrolled in Bilkent University, Faculty of Humanities and Letters, Department of American Culture and Literature. Barbur was interested in theater and music as an amateur during her university years. She graduated in 2002.  Music career  After graduating from university, Barbur moved to Istanbul to start her professional career. When she finally settled in the city, she didn't know any prominent figure in the music market. She tried to meet with musicians by going to venues where a number of them had live performances. After a two-year search, she started making music with a band. She performed in the same venue for four years. During her time there, she created a fan base of her own. Meanwhile, she started writing lyrics and composing at her home in an amateur studio. She eventually met B√ºlent Orta√ßgil with a friend's help. After listening to the demos, B√ºlent Orta√ßgil liked the lyrics and composition and said that she should make an album. However, Barbur had no intention of making an album initially. With Orta√ßgil's help and with the support of her musician friends, she started to have a positive view on the idea of preparing an album. After a while, with Orta√ßgil's suggestion, she signed a contract with the production company Ada M√ºzik. After working at a studio for six months, two thousand copies of her first album, Uyan, were released. After its release, a number of its songs, including \\"Gidersen\\", \\"Leyla\\" and \\"Neden\\", became among the Top 10 hits on a number of music channels. Barbur later performed songs for the soundtracks of the TV series Asi and Sƒ±r Gibi. She had a duet with √ñzg√ºr √áevik on a song made for the TV series Gece Sesleri. Barbur also wrote the song \\"≈ûermin\\" for Zuhal Olcay's album A≈ük'ƒ±n Halleri.

His father died in 1356, resulting in his succession as the third Baron Talbot.  Military career  Talbot served in several English military campaigns. He fought in the Hundred Years War under the Black Prince, and was with the royal fleet under Admiral Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk. During the Peasants' Revolt, he was one of the commissioners tasked with raising forces to fight the rebels.Ross, Barbara, \\"An Account of the Talbot Household at Blakemere in the County of Shropshire, 1394‚Äì1425\\", pp. 11-12 He served under the Earl of Cambridge in Portugal and Spain in 1381‚Äì1382, and was present at the capture of Higuera la Real. During this Iberian service, he was chosen as the ambassador of the English forces to the king of Portugal to demand their wages.Froissart, Jean, \\"Froissart's Chronicles\\" pp. 49-51 He returned to England, where he was called to Newcastle in 1385 for service against the Scots.

Death and legacy  Talbot died on 24 April 1387 and was succeeded by his son Richard. He seems to have been a spendthrift, and left significant debts at his death. A year earlier, he had been pardoned for outlawry after failing to answer the Earl of Arundel concerning a debt of ¬£3000.

Its dedicatee Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducted the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra in the symphony's premiere in Stockholm on 10 November 1994. The symphony is scored for an orchestra of: 3 flutes, 3 oboes, 3 clarinets, 3 bassoons, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, 2 harps, harpsichord, piano, and strings. The movements are as follows: #Moderato #Allegro moderato #Lento #Allegro moderato #Lento The playing time is approximately 35 minutes. The first movement begins with a simple 8-bar melody played on the horns. The movement is based on an ostinato of twenty-two transposed repetitions of this melody passed backwards and forwards between different groups of instruments. The first Allegro moderato acts as an intermezzo. Initially it seems to be a continuation of the ostinato from the first movement but fast crotchets, flourishes, dissonant chords and increasingly dense tone clusters intrude. The dominating movement of the symphony is the central Lento which takes up nearly half the length of the entire work. Its slow theme, initially heard on the strings, evokes the music of various other composers important to Schnittke, including Bruckner, Mahler, Wagner and Shostakovich.Per F. Broman (2005) Liner note from the BIS recording The second Allegro moderato commences with fanfares and, in contrast with the mood of much of the rest of the symphony, attempts at being sprightly but ultimately descends into echoes of Shostakovich-like bleakness. The final Lento (very short at just two minutes) is effectively a coda dedicated solely to the gradual building of a tone cluster of all of the notes of the C major scale spread across more than three octaves which gradually fades.

Kaske studied liberal arts at Xavier University and was called to service for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps during his undergraduate study. He obtained a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1950. He continued in academia, teaching English, where he became an assistant professor and then an associate professor, also earning a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1964, Kaske began working at Cornell University. He founded a medieval studies graduate program and earned another Guggenheim Fellowship in 1977. Throughout his career, he published over 60 articles. Kaske was known for rejecting the \\"New Criticism\\" school of thought, arguing that medieval poetry should be read in context. Kaske married twice and had two children. He died of a brain tumor in 1989.  Early life and education  Robert Kaske‚Äîwho went by Bob‚Äîwas born on 1 June 1921 in Cincinnati, Ohio. His parents were Herman C. Kaske, a postal clerk with the United States Postal Service, and Ann Rose Kaske (n√©e Laake). Robert Kaske attended the boys prep school Elder High School, graduating from the modern English course in 1938. In 1938 Kaske also matriculated at Xavier University, studying liberal arts. In his junior year he was inducted into Alpha Sigma Nu, and played Peter Dolan in a school production of Father Malachy's Miracle. At the end of the year he was chosen \\"Host\\" of Mermaid Tavern, a student literary club. He fulfilled that role as a senior, and was also named editor in chief of The Athenaeum, an undergraduate literary paper, while cofounding a society for students interested in philosophical research. That year Kaske also placed seventh in an intercollegiate writing contest, and appeared in another play, Whispering in the Dark. Kaske graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts on 3 June 1942. Kaske had joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps in his first semester at Xavier, and even before his graduation was ordered to active service. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the army's field artillery on 25 May 1942, and ordered to report to Fort Thomas for a physical examination and assignment, with a furlough to account for his June commencement. Speaking to Kaske and 24 others, the commencement speaker, Archbishop John T. McNicholas, stated \\"[m]ay I assure the Second Lieutenants of this graduating class that the Archdiocese of Cincinnati is proud of them. It is happy to know that Xavier University is not only teaching theoretical patriotism, but that it is actually serving our country in the greatest crisis in its history.\\" Kaske served in the Pacific as a platoon leader and company commander, including on Black Sand Beach in Hawaii. After the army Kaske resumed studies, this time at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). As at Xavier, Kaske wrote for a student paper, Factotum. He received his Masters from UNC, and in 1950, his Ph.D.  Career  Kaske's hiring as an English instructor at Washington University in St. Louis was announced in April 1950, before his June dissertation defense. His work there included studies of Dante Alighieri, and in 1952 he was promoted to assistant professor. Kaske subsequently taught at Pennsylvania State University. He was later hired at UNC, where he began his associate professorship on 1 September 1958. Two years later, he was awarded a grant by the American Council of Learned Societies to work on a book, provisionally titled The Heroic Ideal in Old English Poetry. In 1961 Kaske was also awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study heroism and the hero in Old English poetry, and also served as secretary of the Modern Language Association's Middle English group. From 1962 to 1963, he worked at the Center for Advanced Study at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. In 1964 Kaske joined Cornell University, where he remained for the rest of his life. At Cornell he founded a medieval studies graduate program, which his colleagues later said \\"soon came to be recognized as the foremost program of its kind in North America.\\" In 1968‚Äîa year in which he was first listed in Who's Who in America‚Äîhe was awarded another grant by the American Council of Learned Societies, this time to travel to England and search for the sources of imagery in poems by the unknown Gawain Poet. Another grant by the organization followed in 1971, for further research into the heroic ideal in Old English poetry, and that year Kaske also participated in a symposium on Geoffrey Chaucer held at the University of Georgia. During 1972‚Äì73 he was a Faculty Fellow of the university's Society for the Humanities, and in 1974 he was named the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, succeeding . Three years later, he again won a Guggenheim Fellowship, to undertake research on the sourced and methodology for the interpretation of medieval imagery. Kaske published more than 60 articles throughout his career. One of his primary contributions was to reject the \\"New Criticism\\" school of thought that argued that medieval poetry should be read in a contextual vacuum, culminating in a 1988 book, Medieval Christian Literary Imagery: A Guide to Interpretation. As his colleagues wrote a year later, \\"while this has achieved its due acknowledgment as an indispensable tool for medievalists, no mere book can recreate the rich life its contents enjoyed in the animated version purveyed by Bob himself over three decades.\\"  Personal life  In January 1944 Kaske, then 22 and home on leave, married Mildred Mae Reinerman, a 21-year-old bookkeeper. The two had a son, David L. Kaske married again in 1958, to Carol Vonckx, an English scholar who herself became a professor at Cornell. They also had a son, Richard; at the time of his death, Kaske also had three grandchildren. He died of a brain tumor on 8 August 1989, at his Ithaca home on North Quarry Street. A funeral was held on the 26th, at Ithaca's Immaculate Conception Church, and a memorial service on 21 October at Sage Chapel, with contributions suggested to the university library's Dante-Petrarch or Icelandic collections.

Drosocin is regulated by the NF-Œ∫B Imd signalling pathway in the fly.  Structure and function  Drosocin is primarily active against Gram-negative bacteria. The peptide is proline-rich with proline-arginine repeats, as well a critical threonine residue. This threonine is O-glycosylated, which is required for antimicrobial activity. This O-glycosylation can be performed either by mono- or disaccharides, which have different activity spectra. Like the antimicrobial peptides pyrrhocoricin and abaecin, drosocin binds to bacterial DnaK, inhibiting cell machinery and replication. The action of these drosocin-like peptides is potentiated by the presence of pore-forming peptides, which facilitates the entry of drosocin- like peptides into the bacterial cell. Proline-rich peptides such as drosocin can also bind to microbe ribosomes, preventing protein translation. In the absence of pore-forming peptides, the related AMP pyrrhocoricin is taken into the bacteria by the action of uptake permeases. The Drosocin gene of Drosophila neotestacea uniquely encodes tandem repeats of Drosocin mature peptides between cleavage sites. As a result, a single protein gets chopped up into multiple Drosocin peptides. This tandem repeat structure is also found in the honeybee AMP apidaecin, and is hypothesized as an evolutionary mechanism to increase the speed of the immune response and AMP production. Molecular structure The bolded threonine residue acts as a site for O-glycosylation, also found in the AMPs abaecin and pyrrhocoricin. The underlined PRP motifs are key to the binding of such peptides to the DnaK proteins of bacteria.

With time he would reach the prestigious rank of \\"silversmith of the king,\\" a status he would preserve after Ferdinand's union with Isabella of Castile. Biography and business Vidal Astori's place of birth is not clear, but it was probably the city of Sagunto, where his workshop was located. The juder√≠a of Sagunto was one of the largest of Aragon. It included various institutions for social beneficence and a school for Talmudic studies, opened with direct permission of Do√±a Mar√≠a, Ferdinand's mother.C. Montenegro, M.

Vidal was the most prestigious member of a long tradition of silversmiths of the Jewish faith that went back over a century, which earned him the title of Royal Silversmith of Aragon, and Ferdinand's trust. During Ferdinand's marriage, he was recommended as rab√≠ of the shared court of Isabella and Ferdinand by Ferdinand, against Abraham Seneor. Ferdinand was disappointed when Seneor was elected instead, but he chose to respect the internal hierarchy of the aljamas and accepted the decision.\\"Jud√≠os de √Åvila\\". √Åvila: Diputaci√≥n.(1963) pp. 58-60. In 1480 he received a special permission from King Ferdinand to visit Castile and Portugal and conduct business both in the king's name, and in his own. He established his son, Jahuda, as his agent in Portugal, and his other son, Samuel, as his agent in Valencia. They presumably exported silverwork and Movedre wine to Portugal, and imported black slaves acquired by the Portuguese merchants in west Africa. The Astori family sold 19 black slaves between 1484 and 1485, for a total of 10,575 sous.Mark D. Meyerson, \\"A Jewish Renaissance in Fifteenth-Century Spain\\", Princeton University Press pp 136. In 1486 their business was cut abruptly when the bailiff general issued a decree forbidding the purchase of African slaves from Guinea \\"lest their Christianization be impeded\\".

Carter's second indepdendent feature film is partly autobiographical, its \\"impulse\\" based on an event in Carter's own life and another experience in Schnitzer's. The film toured mainly in Europe, at Film Festival International-organized events in 2017 and 2018, winning a handful of awards ahead of its Canadian premiere at the Gimli Film Festival in 2018, where Shelagh Carter was presented with an award by the Directors Guild of Canada. Synopsis While on vacation in Paris, a couple are faced with a crisis when Jack (Darcy Fehr) announces his intent to pursue a dangerous job that would require him to live in Bangkok for five years, working to combat human trafficking. He assumes that his wife Isobel (Kristen Harris) will follow, leaving her life and career behind. However, Isobel is not prepared to follow blindly. Hurt and feeling misunderstood by one another, they attempt to reconcile their lives and love in Paris while Jack attends business meetings, and in their recently built dream home in Winnipeg. Both struggle with a desire to care for others without being aware of their inability to care for each other, refusing to give up despite themselves and despite the world around them. Cast *Kristen Harris *Darcy Fehr *John Bluethner *Toni Reimer *Graham Ashmore Themes On the surface, Before Anything You Say is a film about \\"life-altering decisions\\", but the way the film deals with the theme, the decision in question leads to an argument which brings other issues to the surface, as Sheila O'Malley points out in an interview with Shelagh Carter: Jack shuts Isobel out of his decisions, and Isobel has abandonment issues: \\"He is making a decision about his life and trying to involve her, but in her mind, he's leaving her.\\" Carter said in response: > Exactly. It's there and we were trying not to flag it. It's a feeling that > registers. ... I'm discovering in my next film ‚Äì which has a more Chekhovian > influence ‚Äì that all of my work in some way is about aspects of betrayal. > And abandonment. It's something really deep in me from my own childhood, and > it's coming up in different forms. The theme of abandonment is seeded throughout the film through brief inserts of other people: younger women, the woman at the coffee shop, the woman at the bar, the couple walking on the street, seeing the girls out the window, shots of long-haired women walking away from the camera: > It's tied to what hasn't been addressed within the couple. The fact that she > abandoned her daughter. The fact that she's heard from her from time to > time. The fact that instead Martin reaches out to her. The father takes care > of everybody else's son and can't take care of his own. They're both > haunted. And then there's the trafficking of women, the lack of respect for > women ‚Ä¶ We wanted to gently touch on that without overkill, and we also > wanted to deal with repetition. These people keep showing up. What world are > they really in? Are they contaminating the two main characters? Or are they > there to point out that they haven't dealt with their shit? Production Inspiration and development The earliest film to inspire Carter was Hiroshima Mon Amour, a collaboration between Alain Resnais and Marguerite Duras: > He always drove home working with writers and he wanted to see if cinema > could tolerate language. I mean that in the best sense of the word, because > as a cinema person I always think of the image, like Antonioni, for example. > Antonioni would put all these pictures together and then put dialogue to the > picture, and it was very sparse and much more traditionally what we conceive > of as being cinematic. But I also felt that I had something to say, and so I > took the story idea to Debbie Schnitzer. Deborah Schnitzer had been collaborating with Carter since the short film Rifting/Blue (2005). At the same time, Carter's husband had just taken advantage of an opportunity which took him elsewhere, and \\"he was gone and here I was, in the prairies, by myself, in the place he wanted to move to.\\" Their relationship was the \\"springboard\\" for Carter and Schnitzer, who drew on an experience of her own walking along the Champs-√âlys√©es, an argument with her own husband of \\"epic proportions\\" whose revelations \\"we scarcely comprehend even now.\\" Carter and Schnitzer talked about how painful it was, \\"when you miss each other, when you think you know the other person ... and then suddenly they take a Left turn. We wanted to mix some of the personal with fictional aspects.\\" Writing and casting When it came to the structure of the script for Before Anything You Say, Carter wanted to play with past and present, and to experiment with memory. Talking about where the characters might have gone on vacation, it was Schnitzer who nominated Paris. \\"Paris is usually the place of love and nostalgia, but for this couple they can't find what Paris is.\\" Schnitzer watched Hiroshima Mon Amour and began writing. Around the time that Carter had gone to see Schnitzer with her story idea, they had both just seen Darcy Fehr in the role of George in a production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: \\"He was terrific.\\". After Schnitzer sent her script to Carter, they had a reading with Fehr and Kirsten Harris, who together had played the lead roles as husband and wife \\"in a similar stressful difficult relationship\\" in Passionflower, Carter's first feature film. The two of them both said, \\"We've got to do this!\\" Financing It is unclear what the budget for Before Anything You Say was, or whether the film had sponsorship beyond C$12,010 raised by November 2015 on crowdfunding website Indiegogo. Filming Principal photography The film was shot over six days by cinematographer Ousama Rawi, who first worked with Carter on One Night. Carter considered him \\"a great mentor\\": \\"Sometimes he kicks my ass and I love it. He believes in me so he's going to give me the straight goods. The bar is high. Why do we settle? No. We do not settle. I love that about him.\\" The film being experimental in structure, trust played an important part for the director and the two leads: \\"I trusted all the years of directing, I had to trust it, and I trusted these two actors. They really went for it. There was a little bit of fear, I think, to really go to those emotional places.\\" Harris loved the role of Isobel, but was \\"beyond scared to do it\\", \\"actually shaking, unable to sleep\\" the night before the first day of shooting: > I felt I didn't have the character yet in my bones, and I think it wasn't > until about 4am that I realized: this is it right here, this fear. Her whole > world is being upended and she's scared. But once day one rolled around‚Ä¶ I > was so beyond happy I didn't want to go home even after hour 14. According to Carter, Fehr was scared too: \\"It hit them in different ways. As soon as Kristen's on a set, she's there. Any anxiety leading up to that moment disappears and she's just there.\\" Fehr's problem was different: he had always played characters \\"who need to seem to be good guys\\", and this character challenged him to be \\"brave\\" and to \\"get ugly\\". > And he did it, he went there. But we were all under stress about doing the > film. I was wearing the producer hat as well. I had to say to Darcy, \\"You're > just going to have to trust me.\\" And ‚Äì fantastically ‚Äì being afraid, or > whatever was going on, fueled his performance in a way that was fabulous. Editing and post-production Before Anything You Say was editor Chad Tremblay's first feature but he and Carter had already worked many times before on short films: > He's one of my former students. He was in my class on the Tuesday of > September 11th. That's how long I've known him. He is a wunderkind. And we > just get each other. He brings so much to the process. I'd say, \\"Let's try > some jumpcuts.\\" He'd say \\"Yeah!\\" And Debbie too ‚Äì she's this post-modernist > poet ‚Äì she would love the story to be even stranger than it already is! But > anyway, the three of us would look at the film and think about rhythm. Chad > has a musician's background and that helps too. Carter referred to David Mamet saying that editing is like a dream: \\"your subconscious is going to show you only what you want to see. And so I'd go away and I'd think about it, 'What is the ending? I don't think I want them in the shot. I think I just want their voices.' We worked with montages, and then we found it, we found the ending. Post-production took place in Toronto under the supervision of Pete Soltesz, a producer on Carter's next film, Into Invisible Light. Soltesz told Carter when she arrived that his team were arguing about Jack and Isobel and who was right, taking sides (Soltesz was on the side of the husband): \\"And it was all men. 'No, I like the husband!' 'She's a bitch.' 'He's not listening to her.' 'Look how he treats her! He's not telling the truth!'\\" Music Keri Latimer is a Winnipeg musician that Carter appreciates and worked with before on Is It My Turn. \\"Debbie and I sent the script to her to see how she responded to the material and she really got it. We didn't want the music to be overkill. She just nailed it. It was the right person, right place, right time.\\" The song which plays at the end credits is Latimer's This Is Not Paris. Release The world premiere of Before Anything You Say took place at the Madrid International Film Festival in July 2017, one of several European film festivals organized by Film Festival International which also screened the film through 2018. Before Anything You Say had its North American premiere at La Femme International Film Festival in Los Angeles on 22 October 2017. The Canadian premiere took place at the Gimli Film Festival on 27 and 28 July 2018 to sold-out crowds, followed by a limited release in Winnipeg in October. Home media A DVD was released in 2018 by Shami Productions. Streaming The film is available for streaming on Amazon Prime. Reception Critical response Sheila O'Malley called Before Anything You Say an \\"extremely intense\\" film, a sometimes \\"hallucinatory\\" study of what happens when things are left unsaid, when trust is broken, when the mere prospect of \\"breaking up\\" becomes the cause of a break-up to start, in which both leads give \\"phenomenal performances\\". > A deeply unsettling film, beautifully written, acted, and directed, it's a > poignant and profound film, and it has a \\"mess\\" to its structure and > approach (I mean that as highest praise) that is a welcome change to the > easily-summed-up and easily-digested material that now passes for \\"adult > relationship\\" dramas. Greg Klymkiw says the film \\"does not disappoint in the long-honoured snipe- fest sweepstakes\\" in terms of the \\"dazzling cinematic potential of watching two great actors verbally slugging it out against the backdrop of claustrophobic domestic strife\\": > Carter's previous outing Passionflower, a harrowing portrait of mental > illness, solidified her position as one of Canada's leading practitioners of > searingly glorious psychological melodrama and this new film manages to up > the ante by delving into territory that blends the delectable properties of > 70s \\"menopause movies\\" (typified by the likes of Gilbert Cates's Summer > Wishes, Winter Dreams) and the sorrow-laden relationship gymnastics of Alain > Resnais (Hiroshima Mon Amour). Klymkiw goes on to praise Deborah Schnitzer's \\"fine\\" screenplay, the \\"sumptuous\\" cinematography of Ousama Rawi, Taavo Soodor's \\"impeccable\\" production design, Keri Latimer's \\"haunting\\" score and editor Chad Tremblay's \\"hypnotic\\" cutting, concluding that the one-hour drama could have \\"sustained itself for even longer.\\" Accolades ;Awards *Directors Guild of Canada, Best Manitoba Director, 2018 (presented at Gimli) *Milan International Filmmaker Festival, 2017 ‚Ä¢ Best Director ‚Ä¢ Best Cinematography in a Feature Film *Berlin International Filmmakers Festival, 2017 ‚Ä¢ Best Lead Actress (Kristen Harris) *Madrid International Film Festival, 2017 ‚Ä¢ Best Editing of a Feature Film ;Nominations *Milan International Filmmaker Festival ‚Ä¢ Best Editing of a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Actor (Darcy Fehr) ‚Ä¢ Best Actress (Kristen Harris) *Berlin International Filmmakers Festival ‚Ä¢ Best Film ‚Ä¢ Best Director ‚Ä¢ Best Lead Actor (Darcy Fehr) *Madrid International Film Festival ‚Ä¢ Best Director of a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Cinematography in a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Actress in a Feature Film (Kristen Harris) *Amsterdam International Filmmaker Festival, 2018 ‚Ä¢ Best Director of a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Cinematography in a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Actress in a Feature Film (Kristen Harris) ‚Ä¢ Nice International Filmmaker Festival, 2018 ‚Ä¢ Best Director of a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Cinematography in a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Lead Actor in a Feature Film (Darcy Fehr) *London International Filmmaker Festival, 2018 ‚Ä¢ Best Director of a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Cinematography in a Feature Film ‚Ä¢ Best Actress in a Feature Film (Kristen Harris) ‚Ä¢ Best Lead Actor in a Feature Film (Darcy Fehr) ‚Ä¢ Best Original Screenplay of a Feature Film Notes References External links *Official trailer on YouTube *Official trailer on Vimeo *Before Anything You Say on IMDb Category:2017 films Category:2010s avant-garde and experimental films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian psychological drama films Category:2010s psychological drama films Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in Winnipeg Category:2017 drama films ","title":"Before Anything You Say"},{"id":"60055675","text":"Jobe's test may refer to: * Empty can test (technically termed Jobe's test), a physical examination maneuver that tests the integrity of the supraspinatus muscle and tendon. * Jobe's relocation test, a physical examination maneuver used in tandem with the Apprehension test to detect anterior shoulder instability. * In the Manga \\"The Seven Deadly Sins\\" Jobe's test is a skill of Goddess Clan ","title":"Jobe's test (disambiguation)"},{"id":"60055682","text":"The Freedom Wall, located at the corner of Michigan Avenue and East Ferry Street in Buffalo, New York, is a mural depicting twenty-eight civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X.

It is the follow-up series to The Haunting of Hill House and the second entry in The Haunting anthology series. The creative team and much of the cast of Hill House returned for Bly Manor, but the two series' narratives are not connected. The Haunting of Bly Manor premiered on Netflix on October 9, 2020. Victoria Pedretti, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Henry Thomas, Kate Siegel, Carla Gugino, and Catherine Parker return as part of the cast for the second series, portraying different characters. Synopsis \\"The story tells of a young governess hired by a man to look after his niece and nephew at the family country house after they fall into his care.

What I will say, though, is that as far as I've ever been concerned with this, the story of the Crain family is told. It's done.\\" On February 21, 2019, Netflix announced a follow-up series to Hill House. Titled The Haunting of Bly Manor, it is based on The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. Though it would serve as a follow-up series to The Haunting of Hill House, it is a standalone story, indicating that there would be \\"no dramatic link between The Haunting of Bly Manor and its predecessor.\\" Although the prominent source for the adaptation is The Turn of the Screw, the season also adapts (some more loosely) multiple James works, some of which had never been adapted previously. Casting Victoria Pedretti and Oliver Jackson-Cohen return as new characters: Pedretti in the role of Dani, \\"a governess who takes care of two very unusual children\\", and Jackson-Cohen portrays Peter, \\"a charming fellow\\". Henry Thomas, Carla Gugino, Kate Siegel, and Catherine Parker also returned for Bly Manor. Filming The Haunting of Bly Manor entered production on September 30, 2019, and wrapped on February 21, 2020, less than a month before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 81 reviews are positive for The Haunting of Bly Manor, and the average rating is 7.24/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"It may not be as scary as its predecessor, but with plenty of spooky tricks inside its haunted halls and a strong sense of heart, The Haunting of Bly Manor is another solid entry into Mike Flanagan's growing horrorography.\\" At Metacritic, the series received a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Personal Life Ronald Joseph was born on the Island of St. Kitts in the West Indies. When he was very young, his mother decided to come to the US but she could not afford to take him with her. Mr. and Mrs. Theophilus Joseph, a childless couple who were friends of Joseph's mother, adopted him. Afterwards, the Joseph family moved to the Island of Dominica, where they stayed for ten years. In 1921, his foster parents also decided to come to the US. In New York, Joseph met his mother but remained living with his foster parents. In 1926 Ronald Joseph received a scholarship for the Ethical Culture School, were he spent two and half years of his high school period. At this time he obtained an art scholarship through Dr. Henry Fritz, with whom he became acquainted through his art teacher in public school. Joseph was taken into the Saturday art class, where he was the only black participant. An artistic prodigy, Ronald Joseph had his student works shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Ronald Joseph graduated from Ethical Culture Fieldston School in 1929. He was honored as \\"the most promising\\" young artist in New York City's schools. He began his study at Pratt Institute in 1931 and graduated in 1934. During the 1930s and 1940s, Joseph participated in many exhibitions of African-American art, the Works Progress Administration mural project, and the Harlem Artists Guild. Ronald Joseph enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps at the declaration of World War II and was posted as a member of the ground crew in Tuskegee, Alabama, and in Michigan. At the end of the war in 1945, he received his G. I. Bill of Rights scholarship. In 1948, he was presented with the Rosenwald Fellowship. The funds allowed him to live and work abroad - first in Peru for two years, then in Paris. Joseph used the G.I. bill to study in Paris at the Grande Chaumi√®re. He described this period of his life as being ‚Äúindependent of economy‚Äù. His work from these travels is largely undocumented; according to Rosenwald scholar, Daniel Schulman, many pieces of art are undated or simply dated \\"1948-1952\\". After this period he came back to New York without money and work and indicated this as period of hardship. Ronald Joseph left the U.S. in 1956, disappointed in the unreceptiveness of the art world to his work with mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, he felt guilty for having left the U.S. during a period when blacks were struggling for their civil rights; on the other, he felt \\"lucky\\" to have been able to live and work in place where he did not feel discrimination as intensely. He emigrated to Belgium and later settled permanently in Brussels. Ronald Joseph was married to Claire Joseph and they had a son, Robin Joseph. In 1989 Joseph returned to the United States after an absence of thirty-three years to attend the Lehman College exhibition and symposium and to renew his old friendships. Afterward, he returned to Brussels where he continued to work as a painter, living there for the remainder of his life. Artistic Career Ronald Joseph started his artistic career in Harlem, New York City at the Harlem Community Arts Center, where he was one of the youngest pupils. Joseph studied lithography and other printmaking techniques with Riva Helfond, who taught him many aspects of the process based on simple techniques, including how to operate the press, and how to prepare the stones. Helfond played a significant role as a teacher of lithography at the Harlem Art Center. Joseph produced his first lithographs under her supervision, and this was at a time when she was just beginning to learn the medium herself. At the Harlem Community Arts Center Joseph met Robert Blackburn, who was his classmate. In 1937 Ronald Joseph depicted Blackburn, in one of his most famous works, that is now located at The Metropolitan Museum collection. Experimenting with lithography and etching, as well as woodblock and silkscreen printing, Joseph explored the techniques of printmaking alongside his friend Robert Blackburn. Joseph described the Harlem Art Center as a \\"healthy and lively\\" place, where he had made wonderful friends. In the late thirties, he also served as a teacher at the Harlem Community Arts Center. There Joseph met younger artist Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight. They formed a friendship, where they enjoyed conversations and visiting museums together. Both Joseph and Knight would hire Lawrence to pose for them. Jacob Lawrence considered Ronald Joseph to be a very intellectual artist. In the 1930s, Joseph became chairman of the Harlem Artists Guild and represented it in Washington with Stuart Davis and Hugo Gellert. Ronald Joseph was also a participant in the mural section of WPA and a representative of the Harlem Artists' Guild to the New York World's Fair (1939-1940). Joseph's early oil paintings were influenced by Picasso, Braque and other European artists while most of his contemporaries focused on social realism. By 1943, he was hailed by art historian James Porter as New York's \\"foremost Negro abstractionist painter\\". His pastels and gouaches from the late forties and early fifties showed a highly structured abstraction combined with a studied spontaneity. Ronald Joseph's finely tuned abstractions often incorporated representational elements along with apparently \\"purer\\" forms. He described this aspect of his work in these terms: \\"It's not abstract and abstract at the same time. It's pure creation.‚Äù His works from the 1950s employed both still life and landscape as pretexts for masterly exercises in nearly abstract pictorial construction related to cubism and fauvism. During World War II, Joseph was drafted. After the war he formed \\"a kind of a group\\" with Robert Blackburn, Charles White, Larry Potter, and Reginald Gammon and made woodcuts. In 1948, after he received fellowships he traveled to Peru and then to Paris, where his work grew increasingly abstract. When he returned to New York, he lived in Greenwich Village and continued to paint, but with little recognition. In 1956, feeling discouraged about his place in the art scene in the US, Ronald Joseph left the US for Brussels, where he continued his artistic career.

It described itself as a magazine of Marxist-Leninist politics and theory.  History  The magazine began publication at the end of the Second World War with the departure of Japanese forces from the Indonesia. However, it was banned in 1948 during the Madiun Affair along with other communist newspapers such as Buruh, Revolusioner, and Suara Ibu Kota. With all the newspapers banned, Musso, the PKI leader, went on Radio Gelora Pemoeda and denounced the government of Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, stating that they were following a policy of capitulation towards the Netherlands and that they had risen to power during the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia with ties to Japan. In the early independence period, the political alignments in Indonesia shifted and the Communists became closer to Sukarno. In August 1950, the magazine was allowed to start publishing again twice per month.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia: 1951‚Äì1963. Univ of California Press, 1966. The new editorial staff were D. N. Aidit, Lukman, Njoto and Peris Pardede. But they still faced occasional persecution; in August of 1951 there were mass arrests of leftists of various parties in East Java, and editor (and PKI central committee member) B.O. Hutapea was among them, along with editors of Trompet Masjarakat, Republik and editors of a number of Chinese Indonesian papers. This was after an earlier round of raids on Communists in East Java, which Hutapea had called a \\"politics of demoralization\\" being waged against them by the government. Bintang Merah claimed to have a circulation of 10,000 by the end of 1950 but gradually declined to under 8,000 in 1953. It was surpassed in circulation by another party paper, Harian Rakjat, which went from 2,000 circulation in 1951 to 15,000 in 1953.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia: 1951‚Äì1963. Univ of California Press, 1966. It is unclear for how long it ceased publication, but a report from early 1964 reports that Bintang Merah was once again allowed to resume publication. However, it was permanently closed in 1965 with the banning of the Communist Party of Indonesia after the September 30 Movement. Most of the editors faced trials and became political prisoners or were executed. B.O. Hutapea escaped and lived in hiding for several years, being finally killed in a shootout with police in Blitar, East Java in 1968. External links * A 1963 speech by Bintang Merah editor B.O.

Powell toured America and Europe as a primadonna soprano, using her breaks from her singing career to carry out philanthropic work and activism, as well as to pursue higher education in a variety of fields, including law, music, and political science. She was the first person to earn a doctorate from the political science department of Columbia University for a treatise on music. She also wrote photoplays about suffrage, patented multiple inventions related to women's fashion, advocated for fashion reform, and lectured on music therapy at universities and colleges around America. She had a three octave vocal range.  Personal life  Alma Webster Hall was born to William Henry Hall and Alma (Webster) Hall, on November 20, c.1869, in Elgin, Illinois.leftHall met future husband Adoniram Judson Powell in New York City. She was singing contralto at a \\"leading church\\"; Judson, the organist and a piano manufacturer, recognized her talent and began working with her to develop it. On April 16, 1890, they married in Brooklyn. He had one son, Everett J. Powell, from a previous marriage. In 1892, Alma Webster Powell gave birth to a daughter, named Marian Webster Powell. The Powells lived in an \\"elegant brownstone\\" on President Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where Alma Webster Powell was known for converting the roof into a \\"star parlor\\" with a \\"bewildering array of rugs, hammocks, cushions and easy chairs,\\" according to a 1908 article in the New York Times. In 1922, Variety reported that Powell sued for $75,000 in damages and was awarded $13,000 from the New York Central Railroad, for injuries received in a train wreck on July 2, 1920. Her husband likewise sued for $20,000 in damages for injuries in the same wreck, and was awarded $2,000.  Operatic career  After working with her husband to develop her voice, Alma Webster Powell traveled to Europe in 1894 to further her studies. She made her operatic debut at the Grand Opera of Frankfort-on-Main, as Queen of the Night in Mozart's The Magic Flute, on May 16, 1895. She remained abroad two more years and in 1897 was engaged by the Damrosch-Ellis Opera Company. She made her American debut in Philadelphia, PA, that year. The next year, she became a member of the Savage Opera Co. and made a success in Martha. According to The National Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography, after her 1900 graduation from New York University, Powell reentered the operatic field, singing at the Stadt Theatre, Breslau, Germany, in The Huguenots, Martha, The Barber of Seville, Lakm√©, Faust, Don Giovanni, La Traviata, Lucia di Lammermoore, and repeating her former successes at the Royal Opera House in Berlin. She also sang at the royal opera houses of Munich, Dresden, Prague, and Vienna. In Prague, April 6, 1902, she created the role of Renata in Eugenio di Pirani's opera Das Hexenlied. On November 7, 1902, Powell performed as a soloist accompanied by Eugenio di Pirani at Carnegie Hall. Powell and Pirani then toured throughout Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and England, before returning to the United States. Pirani credited Powell with lifting him out of an artistic rut at this time in his career. Powell joined the company of the Metropolitan Opera around 1904. In 1906, in conjunction with her husband, she opened the Powell Musical Institute in Brooklyn, teaching voice culture, piano playing, harmony, composition, and languages. Moving Picture News reported that Powell would perform a concert tour of Europe in August 1911 and sing a grand opera in Berlin.  Education  In her early life, Powell was educated by private tutors and at the Girl's high school in Chicago. While on an enforced rest from her singing career, Powell used her free time to earn a law degree from New York University in 1900. She later earned a bachelor of music and a master of arts from Columbia University. Powell returned to Columbia to earn a Ph.D. in political science, graduating in 1913. Her dissertation, Music as a Human Need: A Plea for Free National Instruction in Music, marked the first time that the department had awarded a Ph.D. for a treatise on music.  Writing  The district attorney presents his case to the first woman jury in America (The Motion Picture Story Magazine, March 1912)Powell authored a textbook for singers and students, titled Advanced School of Vocal Art (1901). She also wrote the libretto of Black Blood, set to music by Eugenio di Pirani, translated numerous plays and songs, and wrote for magazines and journals.  Photoplays  In May 1911, Motion Picture Story Magazine announced that their June issue would contain \\"a clever photoplay by one of America's best-known women, Alma Webster Powell, LL.B, B.M., M.A., entitled 'The Candidates', in which Women Suffrage and the labor problem are handled skillfully and sympathetically.\\" The photoplay appeared in the June issue as promised under the title \\"The Rival Candidates,\\" accompanied by photo illustrations. Motion Picture Story Magazine published another photoplay by Powell in March 1912, titled \\"The First Woman Jury in America.\\" This photoplay was made into a silent film by Vitagraph, released on March 11, 1912, starring Flora Finch.Balloting in the jury room (The Motion Picture Story Magazine, March 1912)Powell advocated for the use of moving pictures as educational materials in schools, believing that \\"it is the only way to teach children, for what a child sees in a picture it remembers.\\" She felt that moving pictures would be a good medium for reproducing \\"grand opera stories\\" and \\"the great dramas,\\" as long as care was taken to accurately adapt them to film.  Philanthropy, activism, and suffrage work  Powell was the president and founder of the Public Good Society, which supported the Working Girls' Club and a summer home for tired working girls. She successfully raised large sums for aid of the poor by her voice, and gave free instruction to working girls in music, languages and general science. She was also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, a lineage-based service organization. She strongly favored woman suffrage. She was founder of the American Legislative Union, president of the Debating Society (which discussed suffrage once a month), and lectured for suffrage at street comers. Powell was also a member of the Socialist Party. Powell was a life member of the Women's Press Club, chairing the music committee. However, according to the Carroll Herald, the club asked for Powell's resignation in March 1911. It was reported that club members were upset that Powell \\"too freely discussed the mental capacity of sister members.\\" They also objected to her visible \\"trouserettes\\" and \\"having her hair cut short in man fashion.\\" According to Margaret I. MacDonald, Powell raised $60,000 in 1910 \\"for the betterment of the poor of the East Side\\" of New York City.  Dress reform  Cubist fashion,\\" detail of a 1913 illustration by Harvey Peake. Powell was an active advocate of women's dress reform, urging the adoption of a standard style, in order to abolish the outside appearance of class distinctions; the costume she advocated was a coat dress over bloomers, which she wore on all occasions. Powell also raised objections to the skirt, and was reported to have devised a \\"divided skirt\\" to provide women ease of movement. Powell patented several innovations related to ladies' garments, including a method by which raincoats or other outerwear could be detached at the shoulders and fastened on an underskirt as a form of drapery. In a spread mocking \\"Cubist fashion\\" published in the Chicago Daily Tribune on April 6, 1913, Powell was illustrated alongside suffragists Carrie Chapman Catt and Rosalie Jones, opera singers Geraldine Farrar and Mary Garden, actresses Billie Burke, Alla Nazimova, and Sarah Bernhardt, novelist Edith Wharton, and dancer Gaby Deslys. According to Elizabeth Carlson, the \\"individuality and sexual freedom expressed in the bold new cubist fashions led the press to simultaneously link the new style to radical suffragists and young, fashionable celebrities ... Published in the Chicago Tribune while the cubist canvases [of the Armory Show] were on display at the Art Institute, well-known suffragists and celebrities were shown together wearing the recognizable colorful, geometric, and angular gowns.\\" The newspaper spread's text described each woman's \\"costume\\" in the voice of a fashion show report. The description of Powell emphasized her advocacy for dress reform: \\"The artist seems to have caught that wistful desire for artlessness and sincerity which Mrs. Powell thinks should be the foundation of every woman's clothes.\\"  Music therapy  Powell was an early advocate for music therapy. Building on her Ph.D. work, Powell undertook a lecture tour of the United States around 1919. Her talks promoted music not just as a human need, as she had written in her dissertation, but as a health need. Her lectures were divided into two parts: first, she spoke on the benefits of music for children's health, household management, the nervous system, and stamina; then, Powell demonstrated her musical theories with a recital.  Death  Alma Webster Hall Powell died from heart disease on March 11, 1930, in Mahwah, NJ. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, next to her husband. The New York Times published an obituary about her life and achievements on Friday, March 14, 1930.

In February 2019, the climate protection report 2018 was published, according to which Germany was forecast to miss the self-imposed climate protection targets for 2020. On June 20, 2019, the then-heads of state and government of the EU could not agree on neutrality by 2050, because Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic objected to it.

Set over the course of seven days, the film depicts a group of undocumented Mexican immigrants living in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, who form a soccer team. The film premiered at BAMcinemaFest in Brooklyn in June 2017, and screened in the International Competition section at the Locarno Festival in August 2017. In February 2019, it won the John Cassavetes Award at the 34th Independent Spirit Awards. Plot Jos√©, a bicycle delivery worker, leads a soccer team of undocumented immigrants from Puebla, Mexico. As the championship game approaches the coming Sunday, Jos√©'s boss demands that he work that day for a private party. Cast * Fernando Cardona as Jos√© * Gilberto Jimenez as Elmer * Abel Perez as Jes√∫s * Genoel Ram√≠rez as Artemio * Alfonso Velasquez as Felix * Alejandro Huitzil as Nacho * Gilberto Arenas as Alfonso * Ricardo Gonzalez as Ricardo * Eduardo Espinosa as Juan * Ernesto Lucero as Baltasar Production McKay first conceived of the story in October 2001. The project was shelved for over a decade as McKay went on to direct Everyday People (2004), Angel Rodriguez (2005), and several television series until he resumed working on the film in 2015. The script was inspired in part by the book Mexican New York by Robert Smith, which studies a community of migrants from the state of Puebla, Mexico, to Sunset Park, Brooklyn. McKay said, \\"[I]nspired by this book, the idea that though we might live in the melting pot of New York City, we are often territorial, rarely venturing into or getting to know surrounding neighborhoods a stone's throw away, came into focus once again.\\" The main cast consisted entirely of non-professional actors who were Mexican immigrants, most of whom had come from Sunset Park. The casting process began in the summer of 2015 and lasted for seven months. Each actor was cast without determining which character in the script he would play, and the roles were finally assigned after a period of script reading and soccer practices. Filming took place over the course of 19 days in June and July 2016, in the neighborhoods of Sunset Park, Park Slope, and Gowanus. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score 87 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

Personal life Ribeiro comes from a political family, with his father Enivaldo being the leader of the PP in the state and mayor of Campina Grande from 1977 to 1983; his mother Virg√≠nia was mayor of Pilar, and his sister Daniella is a senator in the local jurisdiction. Ribeiro is a devout Baptist and often takes part with evangelical politicians in campaigning for positions based on Christian values. Ribeiro was at one time a close ally of Eduardo Cunha, and was one of the few deputies in the senate who did not vote for an investigation into Cunha for corruption. Eventually however Ribeiro relented to pressure from other politicians and voted in favor of the investigation, which lead to Cunha denouncing him as a \\"traitor, liar, and hypocrite.\\" Political career Although initially backing her, Ribeiro would ultimately vote in favor of the impeachment against then-president Dilma Rousseff. He would later back Rousseff's successor Michel Temer against a similar impeachment motion, and also voted in favor of the Brazil labor reform (2017). Controversies Ribeiro has been criticized for promoting his family members to political positions, such as appointing one of his nieces as a manager of a firm where she received 700 hours of paid labor for a job she only had to sporadically come to. Ribeiro was investigated in Operation Car Wash due to being named by Alberto Youssef. Shortly afterwards Ribeiro and several other politicians were publicly named by Rodrigo Janot in February 2017 as being investigated for taking bribes. In April 2017 it was announced that Ribeiro and 6 politicians were no longer being investigated, with Ribeiro claiming that this was proof of his innocence.

After beginning her career as a singer, she studied to become a podiatrist, but is most known for her work to uplift the black community and combat lynching. Though she was based in Boston, Simpson spoke throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern United States urging recognition of the human rights of black citizens. Early life Mary Mahala Cravat, known as Minnie, was born on December 6, 1860 in Cumberland, Providence County, Rhode Island to Sarah B. (n√©e Eldridge) and John A. Cravat. She was the youngest of three siblings, which included a brother, Eldridge and sister Clara. Her father was a mulatto, who was born in Pennsylvania to a French father. His profession was a barber, but he served in Company A, Regiment 11 of the Union Army's Colored Heavy Artillery Unit from August 10, 1863 to October 2, 1865.

From 1903 to 1940, she spoke throughout the Northeastern Seaboard and Midwest, giving talks on lynching and racial inequality. In addition to her business career, Simpson was an active clubwoman, involved in the founding of such organizations as the Woman's Era Club (1892), for which she was secretary for 14 years and the Harriet Tubman House (1903). The Era Club and its founder, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, urged the formation of the National Association of Colored Women, which Simpson joined at its formation in 1896. That same year, when the Northeastern Federation of Women's Clubs (1896), was founded Simpson became a member and chaired the anti-lynching committee. She would become chair of the Federation in 1918. When William Monroe Trotter formed the Negro-American Political League in 1908 and split from the NAACP over whether the association should be black-led or allow whites to head and participate in the organization, Simpson, along with Pauline Hopkins, Rev. Matthew A. N. Shaw, and Ida B. Wells, among others, supported and assisted in the endeavor. She was president of the Anti-Lynching Society of Afro-American Women, which formed around 1911, and led the creation effort of the Massachusetts State Union of Black Women's Clubs (1914), acting as its inaugural president from 1914‚Äì1916 and serving again from 1922‚Äì1924.

She also performed as Barbara Fulton.  Early years  Born in Boston, LaCentra studied at the Fenway Academy of Dramatic Art and the New England Conservatory of Music and graduated from Katharine Gibbs College.  Radio  LaCentra worked as an announcer at WNAC and performed on WBZ radio in Boston before moving to New York in 1931 to work on network radio broadcasts. She performed on NBC programs, including Beauty Box Theater, Circus Night in Silvertown, and Lucky Smith. In 1934, LaCentra was billed as Barbara Fulton when she sang with Leo Reisman's orchestra on radio. Use of the pseudonym was necessary because Reisman's sponsor was a competitor of the one for which she sang on another program. In December 1934, she began singing with Harry Reser and his orchestra on a new weekly program on NBC. In 1935, a group of five radio stars selected LaCentra and Bob Lawrence to star in a new program, The Radio City Party, on NBC-Blue. Also in 1935, she was the leading lady on Max Baer's radio program. She gained her own program, The Peg LaCentra Show, on NBC in 1938, a year in which she also sang on For Men Only on NBC.

She and singer Jerry Wayne co-starred in a twice-weekly musical program on CBS in 1944. As a dramatic actress, she frequently played supporting roles in Mutual's romantic thriller, The Modern Adventures of Casanova (1952).

In 1936, LaCentra joined Shaw as a singer for his newly formed orchestra. The two had worked together when she sang on The Mell-O-Roll Ice Cream Show, on which he was a member of the orchestra. In their new relationship, they performed in New York at the Paramount Theater and the Lexington Hotel. She recorded with Shaw for Brunswick records for a year. She also sang with Benny Goodman's orchestra and recorded with Jerry Sears' orchestra for Bluebird Records.

A year after the overthrow of Premier Mohammad Mossadegh the British and American governments began pressuring the reinstated Shah of Iran into negotiations with Britain over the ownership Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The British cabinet had imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran that prohibited the export of key commodities to Iran.Kinzer, All the Shah's Men (2003), p. 110, Britain's boycott had become devastatingly effective with Iranians \\"becoming poorer and unhappier by the day\\".Kinzer, All the Shah's Men (2003), p. 135-136. The dispute was finalized with the incorporation of a 25-year international Oil Consortium Agreement of 1954 which provided British Petroleum along with American and French oil companies with 40% ownership of Iranian Oil expiring in 1979.‚Äù The agreement which was heavily pressured by President Eisenhower, gave American oil companies complete control over how much petroleum Iran pumped and the price it could sell for thus ending Iran's monopoly on the oil trade. Beginning in 1973, the Shah faced increasing tensions with Western nations after announcing he would not renew the consortium agreement upon its expiration and planned to nationalize Iranian oil in 1979. The Shah, speaking to 5,000 farmers and workers, accused the oil companies of mishandling operations under the 1954 agreement. He said he had ordered the national Iranian oil company to start hiring foreign experts to work with Iranians so the company could take over the consortium's duties ‚Äúeither immediately or from 1979.‚Äù Many Iranians accuse Western nations of supporting the overthrow of the Shah due to his failure to renew the consortium agreement in 1979 in what is known as the 1979 Iranian Revolution conspiracy theory. According to the New York Times, the oil companies, through a spokesman, argued that the Shah did not have a legal right to end their contract in 1979, because Iran had the choice of renewing it for 15 years.

Despite the importance of the species, biological studies are usually specialized and limited. The catch for the species reached a peak in the 1950s at 27,000 tons and has decreased since, reaching 2,000 tons in 2003. Due to the commercial importance of the species, many stock enhancement programs have been utilized to help maintain a successful fishery. The species is commonly found on sandy benthic environments from shallow water to depths of up to 350 meters.  Biology and description  E. isenbeckii has a hard shell and soft spines which cover the shell and appendages. can reach over 1 kg in weight. Erimacrus isenbeckii is known to feed three to four times in a ten to twelve hour time-span and cannibalism is common for E. isenbeckii in the spring. The carapace of E. isenbeckii can reach 100 to 120 mm in length in adults. Like the two other species in the same family, the gonophores of females are exposed. In the western Bering Sea, males typically live in areas of around 3.4 ¬∞C and depths of around 66 meters, while females can be found in temperatures of 2.4 ¬∞C and depths of around 64 meters.  Life cycle  The embryonic development of the species can be divided into 9 stages, each defined by cleavage and formation of distinct appendages. To incubate the eggs after spawning, females attach them to their pleopods. Based on many surveys conducted during the spawning and hatching seasons, the incubation period of the species is estimated to be over a year, with the embryonic growth rate mainly being controlled by the temperature of the water. Young hatch between March to May and remain as zooplankton until they reach the bottom of the sea by July. The hatching process occurs during the spring phytoplankton bloom in the Sea of Okhotsk. The zoea of this species can be mistaken for the two other species in the same Family, but E. isenbeckii zoea lack carapace spines and have shorter lateral spines on the fork of the telson.

It bears the title and date \\"VENETIE MD\\" (\\"Venice 1500\\"). It was printed from six wooden blocks designed from 1498 to 1500 by Jacopo de' Barbari, and then published in late 1500 by the Nuremberg publisher Anton Kolb on six large sheets of paper, each measuring about , to create a composite image measuring approximately . The individual sheets of paper were the largest produced in Europe up to that time. The finished work has an approximate scale of 1:1,250 (east-west) and 1:2,750 (north-south) and was probably intended for display on a wall. Examples of the three states of the print are held by public collections. The six wooden printing blocks would have been carved by professional cutters, following preparatory drawings made by Jacopo de' Barbari. The six original blocks, probably made from walnut, now with splits and damage from woodworm, are in the Museo Correr in Venice. Detail of the Piazza San Marco and surrounding area, from the first state of the print, at the Minneapolis Institute of Art The print is one of the first large bird's-eye cityscape views, and may have been inspired by views of Florence by Francesco Rosselli from the 1480s. It may be the earliest surviving comprehensive view of Venice: earlier views by Leon Battista Alberti and Jacopo Bellini are believed to be lost. \\"Jacopo de' Barbari's View of Venice: Map Making, City Views, and Moralized Geography before the Year 1500\\", Juergen Schulz, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 60, No. 3 (Sep., 1978), pp. 425-474 The British Library quotes an article by art historian Martin Kemp in 1991 in which he says it is \\"an achievement of astonishing visual and intellectual control\\".Martin Kemp, Levenson ed.: 1991, p. 255, at \\"View of Venice in 1500\\", British Library Description The print shows Venice and the surrounding islands in the Venetian lagoon, including Burano, Giudecca, Mazzorbo, Murano, and Torcello. The Alps to the north line the horizon along the top edge. The names of some locations and buildings are printed. The print shows the location of Venetian churches and other buildings, including 103 bell towers. The city is depicted in a realistic form, like a topographical landscape view, with large or important buildings depicted on the same scale as smaller or less important ones. Its apparent accuracy has led some commentators to suggest that it may be based on a ground survey, but the analysis of Juergen Schulz in 1978 indicates this cannot be the case. Rather, de' Barbari seems to have started his drawing on the right side (east), perhaps based on plans used for maintenance of the city's waterways, and progressively compressed and distorted the scale as he ran out of space moving towards the left (west) edge. The buildings and street plan are simplified in some areas, and the heights of many buildings are exaggerated, to make towers taller than they should be in proportion to their length or width: so for example the Doge's Palace is depicted about 50% taller than it should be if it were depicted to scale. Winds and deities Around the edge are eight personifications of winds, two on each side, labelled with the names of the twelve classical compass winds or Anemoi: clockwise from the top, Septentrio (T), Aquilo and Fulturnus (G), Subsolanus (cross), Eurus and Eurauster (S), Auster (O), Auster Affricus and Affricus (A), Favonius (P), Corus and Circius (M). The letters refer to the traditional labels of the compass rose: Tramontana to the north, Greco to the northeast, Levante to the east, Sirocco to the southeast, Ostro to the south, Affricus to the southwest, Ponente to the west, and Maestro (Mistral) to the northwest. The positions of each wind are more determined more by artistic considerations than the true orientation of the city in the image. At the top of the print is a depiction of Mercury, the Roman god of commerce, with the inscription \\"MERCVRIVS PRECETERIS HVIC FAVSTE EMPORIIS ILLVSTRO\\" (Latin: \\"I Mercury shine favourably on this emporium which surpasses all others\\". Neptune, Roman god of the seas, with a trident, rides a dolphin in the harbour, accompanied by an inscription reading \\"AEQVORA TVENS PORTV RESIDEO HIC NEPTVNVS\\" (Latin: \\"I Neptune reside here protecting the harbour waters\\"). The Latin title, \\"VENETI[A]E\\" is given in the locative case, specifically locating the image \\"At Venice\\" or \\"In Venice\\". Publication On 30 October 1500, the Signoria of Venice gave Anton Kolb an exemption from duties on the export of the print, and also the exclusive right to reproduce the print for the next four years, one of the earliest known examples of exclusive copyright being granted. The publication of the print in October 1500 was independently mentioned in the contemporaneous diary of the Venetian writer Marino Sanuto the Younger. In his application to the Signoria, Kolb had stated that the print took three years to prepare, but he did not name the artist. The print was traditionally attributed to Albrecht D√ºrer, but that attribution was doubted from the 18th century. Today it is confidently attributed to Jacopo de' Barbari: he marks his works with the caduceus, in this case carried by the figure of Mercury at the top; until a signed painting was identified, his works were attributed to the notname \\"Master of the Caduceus\\". It has been suggested that the portrait of the wind Aquilo may be a self-portrait of de' Barbari. Copies were sold for three ducats, a considerable sum, similar to the monthly wage of a master painter. Examples soon entered the collections of wealthy collectors from church and state. Prints Three states of the print are known, with the second state in two variants. Around a dozen (different sources say 11, 12 or 13) impressions of the first state of the woodcut are known, and a similar number of the other two states. The unusually large number of surviving prints suggests that the work was treated as a valuable work of art, rather than a working topographical image. The first state published in 1500 shows St Mark's Campanile with a temporary flat roof after it was struck by lightning and caught fire in 1489. The second state was published c. 1514; it was altered to show the Campanile as restored in 1511‚Äì4 after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1511, and the original date (MD - 1500) was removed: one variant leaves a blank space where the date was in the first state, and another fills the space with horizontal hatching. The third state was published later in the 16th century, adding back the date (MD), and with the Campanile altered again to show a much cruder version of the flat-roofed depiction in the first state (but forgetting to remove the angel-shaped weather vane added on top of the tower in the adjacent sheet).

It was part of a three-fort system design to defend the Port of Ponce, the Barrio Playa seaport village and the City of Ponce from seaborne attacks.

History Spanish Military headquarters in Ponce, completed 1894 Main fort Fuerte de San Jos√© was one of a three-fort defense system designed by the Spanish military for the defense of the Port of Ponce,During the lifetime of Fuerte de San Jos√©, namely during the years 1760 to 1907, the Port of Ponce was located at the southern terminus of Camino Real, aka, Camino de la Marina, which is today's Avenida Hostos. That location was about one mile west of the current (2019) location of Port of Ponce on Punta Pe√±oncillo. In 1911 the U.S. Federal Government granted the City of Ponce a perpetual franchise to operate the Port. During the second decade of the 20th century (1910s), a new harbor was built.

However, Fuerte San Jos√© was the main fort built to defend the shores of Ponce from the frequent attacks by pirates and nations who were enemies of Spain. A third fort was designed to be located at Punta Cucharas; however, it was never built. On 8 October 1823, 53 years after the construction of Fuerte San Jose and 21 years after the construction of the second battery at El Pe√±oncillo, the Ponce Municipal Assembly discussed plans and established budgeting rules for the financing of the third battery.Ilia del Toro Robledo.

By 1775, but possibly for many years earlier as well, the Spanish had a cannon de a seis (a 6-caliber cannon) in Ponce, in the city proper, for the defense of the city.Eli D. Oquendo Rodriguez. De Criadero a Partido: Ojeada a la Historia de los Or√≠genes de Ponce: 1645-1810. Lajas, Puerto Rico: Editorial Akelarre. 2015. p.80. Since there was a three-mile distance from the city to the port, the port was vulnerable to attacks without the availability of a quick response from city artillery. Thus the port needed its own defense equipment. It was out of this need that Fuerte de San Jos√© was built. The Fuerte de San Jos√© structure was built in masonry, with housing quarters and supplies storage also in masonry.Ramon Marin. La Villa de Ponce, considerada en tres distintas √©pocas. In, Las fiestas Populares de Ponce. San Juan, PR: Editorial de la Universidad de Puerto Rico. p.190. It provided a base defense structure and, to complement it, two other defense structures were planned. Fuerte de San Jos√© was located between the Caribbean Sea and the village of La Playa and just west of the port facilities. The second structure, a battery, was built in 1801 at El Pe√±oncillo (Punta Pe√±oncillo), a location east of the port. A third structure yet, this one also consisting of only a battery, was planned for Punta Cucharas, but was never built. The battery at El Pe√±oncillo was built and completed by Jos√© Ben√≠tez. This battery was donated to the people of Ponce by its teniente a guerra.A teniente a guerra was a combination \\"military commandant/civil superintendent\\" that the Spanish Crown, via its Colonial Governor in Puerto Rico, planted in each district to oversee a region of the governed territory. See \\"Puerto Rican Poetry: A Selection from Aboriginal to Contemporary Times.\\" by Robert M√°rquez. University of Massachusetts Press. 2007. p.55. Jos√© Ben√≠tez built it \\"from his own money\\" and the battery was later accepted by the Spanish Crown as part of the Spanish arsenal in Ponce. Benitez's battery was 24.5 varas wide (about 75 feet) and \\"of the necessary height to make a secure and solid edification\\". It had four doors, two at each side, two 6-caliber cannons, and all the necessary supplies to mount a defense. It possessed enough supplies to support 50 men for thirteen days, as well as support personnel such as blacksmiths and carpenters. The structure's initial stock contained gunpowder, bullets, rifles, and crowbars.Eli D. Oquendo Rodriguez. De Criadero a Partido: Ojeada a la Historia de los Or√≠genes de Ponce: 1645-1810.

US troopships and convoy at Playa de Ponce, 1898 Later years On 20 March 1885, the Spanish governor in Puerto Rico, Luis Daban, informed the Spanish military commander in Ponce he had decided to withdraw the military located at the fort on a permanent basis and ordered the transfer of any pieces of artillery and ammunition stored there to San Juan, effectively decommissioning Fuerte de San Jos√© as a fortress.Eli D.

During the next few years, and as it deteriorated for lack of repair, it received some use by the local Ponce municipal guard that served Barrio Playa. It was still standing, but nonoperational, at the time of the American invasion of Puerto Rico in 1898, and was demolished in 1907 by order of the Puerto Rico Legislature in order to enlarge Calle Alfonso XII and make room for civilian population growth in that area. The location of Fuerte San Jos√© is today occupied by Plaza 65 de Infanter√≠a, a small, passive, family- oriented plaza from where the Caribbean Sea can be observed. The location of the battery at El Pe√±oncillo is today (2019) the entrance to the dike- supported roadway that leads from mainland Puerto Rico to Club N√°utico de Ponce on Isla Gatas, and the location for the third battery that was never built is today the protected area of Reserva Natural Punta Cucharas.

He served on a judiciary panel with Nieve Frawley who was later the chief stipendiary steward in Queensland Racing. Roden met and married Nieve's daughter Elaine Frawley. For a brief period Roden relocated to Sydney and rode trackwork for the trainer Jack Green. In 1949 Roden commenced his career as a trainer in Toowoomba, Queensland. His first winner was Falcon Man at Eagle Farm in 1950, Roden's second ever starter. He had some success with the sprinter Gresford and relocated to Brisbane. Gresford was responsible for the first Roden betting plunge in December 1953 backed from 66/1 to 6/1 to a win at Eagle Farm. In 1954 Dick & Elaine bought Gresford from their client owner and it was the first horse to travel by air from Queensland to a race meeting in Victoria where under their regular jockey David Hetherington it won the Fawkner Highweight at Moonee Valley. With Hetherington again in the seat, Gresford won the 1954 QTC Lightning event. Continuing success saw Roden in 1956 charged with the care of the New Zealand sprinter, El Khobar by owner Wolff Fisher. He played his part in that horse's overall tally of seven wins and two places in a nine start Australasian program before sending the horse to the USA where it had three wins and set a Santa Anita track record. In 1967 Roden relocated to Sydney and bought a Randwick stable operation in High Street from Dan Lewis, renaming it Midstream Lodge. The Australian Jockey Club granted Roden a number 1 licence in September 1957. In 1959 Roden's name was set in Australian racing when he took the gelding Macdougal to an extraordinary treble in winning the Brisbane Cup, Metropolitan Handicap and Melbourne Cup. At age 33 Roden became Australia's youngest ever trainer of a Melbourne Cup winner and overnight attracted wealthier owners seeking him out. He trained a number of winners for Stan and Millie Fox including Honeyland to the 1967 Canterbury Guineas which Roden had picked out as a New Zealand yearling and bought for the Foxes in 1966. In 1968 Roden met the Filipino businessman Felipe Ysmael and Roden took on his stable of Australian horses including Tereus, Sliver Strike and Divide & Rule taking them to some success. When Ysmael was disqualified from involvement in Australian racing after the 1968 Follow Me scandal, Dick & Elaine bought Divide & Rule from Ysmael. In the space of fifteen months Roden lost two of his major clients in Fox and Ysmael and he suffered a nervous breakdown in 1969. Roden stepped back from training in 1969 and under Neville Begg, Divide & Rule won the 1969 AJC Derby ridden by the Queensland Aboriginal jockey Darby McCarthy. In 1970 Roden and Begg set their sights on the Stradbroke Cup for Divide & Rule. On the flight to Brisbane ten days before the event the horse suffered a head bump and injury but in spite of many journalists and punters dismissing the three-year old's prospects, it won the 1970 Cup. The Rodens took $17,000 in prize money and many punters nationwide saw returns from 10/1 to 5/1. It was one of the largest betting plunges in Australian racing history. A few weeks later Divide & Rule won the Doomben Cup starting as an even favourite. In 1970 Divide & Rule was leased by the Rodens to Mrs Muriel Blum of Chicago. It won a further US$90,000 in prize money there in addition to the $80,000 it had won in Australian starts. Dick Roden gave up his trainer's license in 1970 at the point of Divide & Rule's transfer to the USA. Roden became a publican in Waterloo, Sydney for a period in the 1970s. In the mid 1970s Dick and Elaine relocated back to Queensland where they established a successful breeding business in Roden Bloodstock. Training record In a relatively short training career of less than two decades and with only a small team of horses his classic, group and listed winners included: * Kev Mar: 1953 Queensland Guineas; 1954 AJC Villiers. * Gresford: 1954 QTC Lightning Handicap. * French Charm: 1955 Moonee Valley Stakes; 1956 Theo Marks Quality. * El Khobar: 1956 Doomben 10,000, QTC Ascot Handicap.

It is native to the Neotropical realm in the Americas. Description The genus consists of small ferns with arching fronds of determinate size. Rhizomes are radially symmetric or slightly flattened, with orange to brown scales which often bear setulae (small bristles) on the edges and sometimes the surface. Except for Terpsichore atroviridis, sporangia bear setae (bristles). The stipe (leaf stalk) is distinct from the blade, and the blade does not taper gradually to its attachment to the rhizome. Setae on the leaf tissue are borne singly, rather than in clusters, and hydathodes (enlarged vein endings) do not secrete a chalk precipitate. Unlike Ascogrammitis and Mycopteris, black fungal fruiting bodies are not found on the leaf blades. Taxonomy Terpsichore was first described by Alan R. Smith in 1993, one of several genera to be recognized to remove many Neotropical grammitids from the genus Grammitis. The name, originally applied to some members of the group by L. Earl Bishop, but not published by him, honors Terpsichore, the muse of dance. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses showed that Terpsichore, as originally described, was polyphyletic. Five new genera, Alansmia, Galactodenia, Moranopteris, Ascogrammitis, and Mycopteris were recognized in order to accommodate most of the species in the genus; the species from only one of Smith's five informal infrageneric groups, the Terpsichore asplenifolia group, remain in Terpsichore as presently circumscribed.

The mid- rise buildings are normally constructed with four or five wood frame stories above a concrete podium (usually housing retail or resident amenity space). The one-plus-five style of buildings exploded in popularity in the 2010s, following a 2009 revision to the International Building Code which allowed up to five stories of wood-framed construction. Description Apartment buildings in Long Branch, New Jersey featuring three wood-frame stories over a concrete podium The first recorded example of one-plus-five construction is an affordable housing apartment building in Los Angeles built in 1996. The wood- framed one-plus-five style is popular due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs compared to steel and concrete. One-plus-five buildings often feature secure-access interior hallways with residential units on both sides, which favors a U, E, C, or right-angle building shape. The exteriors of one-plus-fives often contain flat windows, rainscreen cladding, and Hardie board cement fiber panels. These buildings are also sometimes called a Wrap or Texas Doughnut, which describes a multifamily building that's wrapped around a parking garage in the center. This style is common in areas with higher minimum parking requirements. Criticism One-plus-five buildings are often criticized for their high fire risk as well as their blandness. Some cities and jurisdictions have considered additional regulations for multi-story wood-framed structures. The city of Waltham, Massachusetts called for legislation to prevent the construction of multi- story wood-framed buildings, which was introduced following a fire at an under-construction wood-framed condominium in the city. The borough of Edgewater, New Jersey introduced a resolution calling on the state of New Jersey to enact stricter fire safety regulations for wood-framed buildings, following a large fire that occurred in the wood-framed Avalon at Edgewater apartments in 2015.

The preferred alternative would begin at Interstate 15 and the Legacy Parkway in Farmington, proceeding northwest through the communities of Kaysville, Layton, and Syracuse, before coming to an end at 1800 North in West Point. Route description The highway will begin at an interchange with I-15/US-89 and Legacy Parkway just south of Glovers Lane in Farmington, proceeding to the northwest as a four-lane freeway. It will swing to the north, following the shoreline of the Great Salt Lake, before turning northwest at an interchange with a proposed connection to Shepard Lane. The freeway will then continue northwest through the cities of Kaysville and Layton, with interchanges at 200 North and 2700 West. Entering Syracuse, the route will shift onto the alignment of Bluff Road, with interchanges at 2000 West and Antelope Drive (SR-127). Past Antelope Drive, the highway will narrow to two lanes. As the route continues into West Point, it will turn to the north, ending at 1800 North (SR-37). History Initial proposals The idea for a new corridor connecting Ogden and Salt Lake City existed as early as the 1960s. However, it was not officially studied until 1995, when state representative Marda Dillree pushed the Utah State Legislature to allocate $600,000 for a corridor planning study. The idea was included in Governor Mike Leavitt's ambitious Legacy Highway proposal in 1996; Leavitt envisioned a new highway running from Brigham City to Nephi through the western portions of the Wasatch Front, though no route had been selected at that time. Other portions of this proposal would become today's Legacy Parkway and Mountain View Corridor. Almost from the beginning, the planned routing of what was then known as the Western Transportation Corridor was filled with disputes. In particular, a dispute over the routing north of Gentile Street in Layton came to a head in April 1997, when the committee tasked with selecting a route could not come to an agreement. Officials from West Point had identified a corridor along Bluff Road and had been preserving land along it since 1986. However, Syracuse preferred a western alignment that would not split the city, citing hazards to schools and other city facilities. Two western routes were being studied: one that ran roughly between 4200 and 4500 West, and another just east of the Great Salt Lake marshes. The 4500 West corridor ran through 1,000 acres of productive farmland and was deeply opposed by farmers and the state agricultural department, while the Great Salt Lake corridor would negatively impact wetlands protected under federal law. While Davis County cities and residents mostly supported the proposal, reception in Weber County was much more mixed. Some officials from that county opposed reserving land for a highway that might not ever be built, while others worried about the agricultural lifestyle of northwestern portions of the county. They also stated that the new corridor was not near the top of their priority list, instead favoring improvements on I-15 and existing arterials. Farr West opposed any route coming close to the Weber County line, while Hooper residents would support a highway provided it would only carry local traffic. However, most of these disputes had been resolved by July of that year, when the committee was finally able to select a route through northern Davis and southern Weber counties. Under the agreement, it would follow Bluff Road from Gentile north to 300 North in West Point, where it would go north into Weber County to the intersection of 4900 West and 5500 South. From this point it would continue to 4000 South along an alignment just west of 4700 West, before moving east to 3500 West and continuing north to end at 1200 South. This corridor was identified as the preferred alternative in a 2001 study. A route through the rest of Weber County would not be identified until a 2009 supplemental study. Possible connections between the proposed corridor (then referred to as Legacy North) and Legacy Parkway were identified in a 2007 UDOT study, which identified a preferred alignment beginning at a combined interchange with I-15/Legacy Parkway and roughly following the old Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad alignment northward. However, Farmington was unhappy with this result and commissioned its own study, which recommended waiting to adopt an alignment until a full environmental analysis could be conducted. Environmental studies In 2010, UDOT began an $8 million federal environmental impact study on the North Legacy Corridor, though by this time UDOT had changed the name of the project to \\"West Davis Corridor\\". To avoid legal battles similar to the Legacy Parkway controversies, UDOT reached out to environmental groups early on in the process. Environmental groups generally opposed the highway, citing concerns over wetlands and air quality. By August 2010, the UDOT study had identified four possible routings through northwestern Davis County: the 2001 alignment along Bluff Road, another alignment east of Bluff Road following existing electrical transmission lines, another alignment further east following the FrontRunner commuter rail line, and a fourth alignment along the eastern edge of the Great Salt Lake. The study had narrowed down to three potential options by September 2011, including two alternatives that would have negative impacts on wetlands and agriculture, plus a \\"no-build\\" alternative. The study was further refined in 2012, decreasing the area of wetlands, agriculture, and number of homes affected. The draft environmental impact study was released in May 2013, outlining one proposed route that would begin at I-15 and Legacy Parkway in Centerville, proceeding generally northwest and north to 4100 West in Weber County. The cost was estimated at $587 million; the route would impact 26 homes, 110 acres of high-quality farmland, and 52 acres of high-quality wetlands. The proposed routing was not without controversy. Although Farmington city officials supported the highway, they continued their opposition of the Glovers Lane routing, believing such an alignment would effectively bypass the city. Farmington officials suggested a connection to Interstate 15 at Shepard Lane instead, stating it would benefit the city and relieve congestion on Park Lane. Shared Solution However, the strongest opposition to the proposed freeway came from environmental groups. A coalition of several groups including the Sierra Club, Great Salt Lake Audubon, and Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment proposed a \\"shared solution\\" and distributed it to several top officials. Instead of building a new freeway, the Shared Solution proposed to enhance existing roads and increase transit, emphasizing \\"boulevard community development\\", new innovative intersection designs, and locally focused road designs. It also proposed widening existing east-west arterial roads and building a reversible lane on I-15. According to its proponents, the Shared Solution improvements combined would move the same amount of traffic as a freeway. UDOT agreed to study the Shared Solution, but rejected it in 2016 after determining it would not alleviate congestion enough to meet transportation needs in 2040. However, UDOT acknowledged the efforts of the Shared Solution coalition, and included many ideas from the Shared Solution in plans for the West Davis Corridor as well as other area projects. Final planning The final environmental impact statement was released on July 6, 2017, followed by a two-month public comment period. The 2017 route was largely identical to the one proposed in 2013, extending from Glovers Lane northwest to 1800 North (SR-37) in West Point. Although Farmington had pushed for the highway to end at Shepard Lane, UDOT studies determined an interchange in that location would not meet federal safety guidelines due to its proximity to the US-89/Legacy interchange. Unlike the similar Legacy Parkway to the south, the freeway would have a 65 mph speed limit and allow large trucks, but UDOT officials expect low truck traffic on the corridor. However, several concessions were made to environmental groups; in particular, UDOT agreed to use dark-sky lighting designs, ground-level construction, and noise-reducing pavement. In addition, 20 miles of new multi-use trails will be built paralleling the highway. Although not all parties were happy with the results of the study, most were satisfied with the changes UDOT had made between the 2013 and 2017 environmental studies. The Federal Highway Administration and UDOT issued a final record of decision in September 2017, with property acquisition and design continuing through 2018 and 2019. Construction of the segment between I-15 and Antelope Drive is expected to begin in 2020 and last through 2022, at a cost of $610 million.

The Act was established \\"To facilitate the admission of the unsworn testimony of Aboriginal inhabitants of South Australia and parts adjacent\\". History The lieutenant Governor George Grey was responsible for the act, and later lieutenant Governor Frederick Robe was responsible for the acts amendments. The acts:   While its stated aim was to make provisions for unsworn testimony by \\"uncivilised people\\" to be admissible in court, the act made it possible for a judge to dismiss the testimony of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" as insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence - that the court could not base the conviction of a White man on the testimony of an Aboriginal witness alone. Although it was a progressive law for the time, the act decreed that the credibility of the evidence be left to the discretion of \\"the justice of the court, or jury under direction of the judge\\". The act also made Aboriginal testimony inadmissible in trials that carried the penalty of death. Effectively, the act created a situation where settler solidarity and the law of evidence ensured that the murder and massacre of Aboriginal Australians by European colonisers could not be tried solely on the evidence of Aboriginal witnesses. Possibly in response to the, Avenue Range Station massacre, where three Tanganekald women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\" were murdered by Australian mass murderer and pastoralist James Brown, the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 was amended in July 1849 to allow a person to be convicted on the sole testimony of an Aboriginal person, though this rarely occurred.

Natural history The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. A shale barren, the Broad Run barren, is on the western side of the area. Shale barrens in western Virginia provide habitat for the Appalachian grizzled skipper Although small, the area forms an important wildlife corridor between the Broad Run wildarea to the north and North Mountain on the southeast. Several old growth tracts have trees as old as 140 years of age or older. Topography The area includes several peaks over 2000 feet elevation, including the 2034-foot Spesard Knob on the southwestern side of the area. Spesard Knob is part of a mountain complex at the southern end of Broad Run Mountain where Craig Creek has breached the ridge that continues as Sinking Creek Mountain on the south. Broad Run flows along the southeastern side of the area. Lick Branch, on the north boundary of the area, drains into Craig Creek. Other streams in the area are also part of the Craig Creek drainage, a tributary of the James River. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Spesard Knob was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The Cuba wildfire in 2008 burned a large part on the north side of the area as well as part of the adjacent Broad Run wildarea. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area is designated ‚ÄúBackcountry-Non Motorized‚Äù. A portion on the western tip is designated as ‚ÄúRare Community‚Äù.

The Royal Navy purchased her in 1801. The Navy sold her in 1815 and she returned to mercantile service. She was lost in 1818.

Perry & Co. sold her to the navy on 28 February 1801. Royal Navy Autumn Commander William Richardson commissioned Autumn in February 1801 for the Downs. On 5 January 1803 sailed for the Mediterranean but grounded the next day on Sconce Point, near The Needles, Isle of Wight. and Autumn sailed to her assistance. By the 11th Abundance had gotten off with little damage and she then sailed for Gibraltar.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4315.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.79. Autumn was recommissioned by Commander Samuel Jackson on 10 May 1803. He sailed for the French coast on 31 July. On 27 September Jackson took a small squadron at Rear Admiral Montague's behest and bombarded the French gun boats at Calais. The objective of the engagement was to prevent the French at Calais from linking up with the French flotilla at Boulogne. The commencement of a gale forced the British to withdraw. With the British squadron having withdrawn, Over the next two days the French succeeded in getting over 50 boats from Calais to Boulogne. Early in 1804, a division of the French flotilla was discovered to be sailing along the French coast to Boulogne protected by shore batteries. The British vessels in the area attacked and were able to drive several vessels onto the beach. However, most succeeded in reaching Boulogne. Autumn lost one man killed and six wounded in the operation.Marshall (1827), Supple., Part 1, pp.273‚Äì5. In the evening of 20 July there were more than 80 French brigs and luggers in the roads of Boulogne. As the weather worsened, a number of the vessels set sail. Captain Owen of signaled to , , and to close with the French vessels. Autumn also joined the operation. Although most of the French vessels escaped, the British were able to drive a handful on shore. Autumn also participated in an attack on the Boulogne flotilla on 2 October 1804 using explosive catamarans. He was ordered to lay alongside French Admiral Bruix. As he approached the Admiral's praam the string to operate the clock slipped out of his hand. He broke open the hatch on the catamaran, retrieved the string and stepped into his gig as he pulled it. Twenty-five seconds later the vessel exploded but the explosion did no damage except remove the praam's bowsprit. When Jackson returned to the Downs he was invited to dine with Prime Minister William Pitt, Lord Harrowby, and Lord Melville. Melville promised to promote Jackson, but Melville left office before he could make good on his promise. (Jackson received promotion to post-captain in 1807, after he had left Autumn.) Commander Thomas Searle assumed command Autumn in October 1804. Autumn shared with the gun-brigs , , and , in the salvage money for George which they retook in February 1805. It was believed that George had been sailing from Bristol to London when a French privateer had captured her and taken her into Boulogne, where her cargo was landed. Autumn and the brigs recaptured George as she was on her way to Calais and they sent her into Dover.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4194. In October 1805, Autumn was at Portsmouth where she underwent fitting as a receiving ship. In October 1809 Commander Corbet James d'Auvergne recommissioned her. Strombolo Between December 1810 and May 1811, Autumn was refitted at Portsmouth as a bomb vessel. On 15 February 1811 she was renamed Strombolo. Commander Samuel Grove recommissioned her in March. On 11 December he sailed her for the Mediterranean. During 1812 she came under the command of Commander Thomas Hichens, Commander John Stoddard on 3 July, then Grove again, and Commander John Smith in August. By June 1813 Commander John Stoddart had again assumed command of Strombolo. Between 3 and 7 June 1813, Strombolo, Captain Stoddard, participated in an Army-Navy operation that captured Fort St Philippe in the Coll de Balanguer that controlled the pass on the road between Tortosa to Tarragona. The naval force consisted of , , Brune, Strombolo, and , and eight gunboats. Lieutenant James, RMA, landed two 8\\" mortars from Strombolo and commenced to fire on the fort while guns from squadron were being landed to establish a breaching battery. After the mortar shells blew up the fort's magazine, the garrison surrendered though the battery had not yet commenced fire. Captain Stoddard and Captain Zehnpfennig entered the fort and brought back the surrender offer. Strombolo suffered no casualties in the engagement. At some point Commander Samuel Grove resumed command. Commander Stoddard again commanded Strombolo in 1814.

Architecture A collegiate church had existed in Ariccia since perhaps the 6th century, and it was based around the former church of San Nicola di Bari in town. That church was rebuilt and rededicated over the centuries. But interested in erecting a prominent church across from their palace in town, also undergoing restructuring by Bernini, the Chigi family commissioned the designs of Santa Maria Assunta from the architect. Construction began circa 1661 and led to consecration in 16 May 1664. Exterior While the exterior is austere and has a portico and dome that recall the Pantheon in Rome; the interior, including the ceiling of the dome, is highly decorated in a Baroque fashion. The entrance portico has three arches flanked by walls with decorative Doric pilasters. Originally the portico cornice had the script stating Beatae Mariae Virgini Dei Matri in Caelum Assumptae (Blessed Mary Virgin Assumption as Heavenly Mother), along with a coat of arms of Pope Alexander VII. The circular church appears to have stood independently at the site upon construction. The two flanking wings that encircle the church were built in 1771 under the patronage of Prince Sigismondo Chigi; they were not part of Bernini's design. This reconstruction altered the cornice to read Deiparae in Coelum Assumptae Mother of God in Heaven after Assumption. Inside the portico, above the door, is a star in a circle with the inscription of Stella matutina ora pro nobis (Morning Star pray for us). The buildings at the wings have two-story rectangular porticos with entrances flanked by double pilasters. In the piazza in the front are two fountains. In 1778, a rededication included lateral altars in the church dedicated to the Holy Trinity and St Augustine of Ippona. Further reconstruction was performed in the last century to the structures, repairing damage done by bombardments during World War II, and repairing damage to exterior stucco. Interior The pavement mosaic was designed by Bernini with the Chigi heraldic symbol in the center; the stone was replaced in 1956, changing from brick and Peperino stone to two colors of marble. The cupola of the dome was decorated by Bernini's studio, but at the base the Angels that sustain the garlands were sculpted by Antonio Raggi.A Cyclopaedia of Works of Architecture: In Italy, Greece, and the Levant, edited by William Pitt Preble Longfellow, Charles Scribner's sons New York, 1903, page 20.

Career and Work  Castro-G√≥mez began studying philosophy at Santo Tom√°s University in Bogot√°, Colombia with members of the \\"Bogot√° Group.\\" He received his M.A. in Philosophy at the University of T√ºbingen and his Ph.D at the Goethe University Frankfurt am Main in Germany. In addition to his academic positions in Colombia, he has served as visiting professor at Duke University, Pittsburgh University and the Goethe University of Frankfurt. Castro-G√≥mez is a public intellectual in Colombia whose work has been the subject of conferences and books, debates over Colombian identity, research on Latin American philosophy, as well as artistic installations. He is the author or co-editor of more than ten books, many of which have been reissued in new editions. As director of the Pensar Institute in Bogot√°, he has led an initiative to engage the public, and specifically early public education, on the effects of racism and colonization in Colombian society. Alongside An√≠bal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, Enrique Dussel, Ram√≥n Grosfoguel, Catherine Walsh, Arturo Escobar, Edgardo Lander and Nelson Maldonado-Torres, Castro-G√≥mez was part of the \\"Modernity/Coloniality\\" group, a circle of Latin American critical theorists formed at the beginning of the 21st century. Castro-G√≥mez's work develops alternatives to dominant approaches and figures in Latin American Philosophy, an intervention he makes explicit in Critique of Latin American Reason (1996). In addition to colleagues like An√≠bal Quijano and Walter Mignolo, his major influences include the Frankfurt School, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. The work of Castro-G√≥mez explores the \\"frontiers\\" between sociology, anthropology, literary studies and cultural studies, while also reflecting on methodological and epistemological problems within the social sciences. In \\"The Hubris of the Zero Point,\\" Castro-G√≥mez characterizes Rene Descartes' 1637 famous statement of \\"I think, therefore I am\\" as \\"the moment white Europeans installed themselves above God as the sole arbiters of knowledge and truth.

The river is impounded behind a dam to form Lake Kuratau before discharging through the power station back into the river. The scheme is operated by Trustpower on behalf of its owner King Country Energy. History Development In 1952 Lloyd Mandeno who was the consulting engineer to the King Country Electric Power Board suggested to the board that they consider building a power station. With demand and its revenues increasing (it increased by 1375% between 1948 and 1958), having its own generation would reduce the amount of power the board would have to purchase from the State Hydro-Electric Department (SHD), while also boosting industrial development in the board's area. The SHD was in 1958 renamed the New Zealand Electricity Department (NZED). Mandeno identified that Kakahi on the Whakapapa River would be a suitable location. However the SHD turned down the board's application for a licence to build a power station as they also intended to utilize the river to generate electricity in what later became the Tongariro Power Scheme. Continuing his investigations Mandeno identified what he thought was another suitable site in a narrow gorge that could utilize the Kuratau River. The board authorized him to spend up to ¬£400 on further investigations. Satisfied with Mandeno's conclusions, the board in August 1953 decided to apply for a generation licence and commenced discussions with the SHD to determine if they had any objections and with the Local Government Authorities Loan Board. The Loan Board was prepared to offer a 40-year loan, while the SHD indicated that it was prepared to buy any surplus power produced by the station. Detailed design of the power station was then undertaken by consulting engineers Mandeno, Lee & Brown (of which Lloyd Mandeno was a principal). Delays then occurred as it took time for the board to secure access to the proposed site to undertake detailed investigations as the land was part of a Maori development block that was jointly owned by several Maori families. Both them and the Department of Maori Affairs who were responsible for administering the block were concerned over how much valuable farming land was going to be lost and what compensation would be offered. Eventually, the amount of the compensation that board had to pay to the land owners had to be settled in court. As a result, it took until 1955 before the board was granted a licence to generate electricity at Kuratau. Further delays then occurred with obtaining the generation equipment, which had to be imported. The station's output was to be distributed over 33 kV transmission lines which had to be built. While it was not the first such line in the board's area it was the first that they contracted out for construction and as such delays were incurred in obtaining some of the equipment that required. After its construction loan was secured in 1959 tenders were issued for construction and supply of equipment. Fletchers Construction won the contract to undertake the civil works with a price of ¬£295,000. English firm Boving & Co won the contract to supply the turbines and other hydraulic machinery, Swedish firm ASEA won the contract supply the generators, while local company Turnbull & Jones were awarded the contract to supply the control panels and install the electrical equipment. Fletcher Steel & Engineering won the contract to supply the steel for the penstocks, intake trash racks, control gates and the powerhouse structure. An 8-km-long access road was created to a construction camp where several workshops, temporary accommodation, and three permanent staff houses were established on a bluff above where the power house was to be built. The nearest pub was however 26 km away which created issues for those in the workforce wanting to have a drink after work as this was during the days of the Six o'clock swill which meant the pub closed at 6 pm. Construction Construction began in 1959 under the management of Tony Campbell of Fletchers what was intended to be a concrete arch dam which would convey the water via a short tunnel and canal to penstocks and hence down to the power house. However, as excavation began it was found that sides of the narrow gorge in which the dam was being built were unstable, with a large amount of sand being encountered. This was a common issue on the volcanic soils of the central North Island and had been encountered on some of the power stations that had been built on the Waikato River. Digging continued, but it soon became obvious that it would be impossible to find any sound rock into which to anchor the abutments of the dam. Mandeno, Lee & Brown quickly redesigned the power station to make use of another site 400 metres further upstream for which they designed a low rock-fill dam from which an open canal, penstocks and a surge chamber could convey the water to the powerhouse. Once the dam was completed, the lake took one week to fill. Commissioning By early 1962 one penstock had been installed which allowed its associated generator to be commissioned and then commence commercial operation at midnight on 16 April 1962 and immediately began bringing in a potential revenue of ¬£150 to 200 per day. A large crowd celebrated the official opening of the station on 25 May 1962. The second generator entered service on 21 June 1962. Following the completion of the work, the construction site was cleared during the middle of 1962, with all temporary construction buildings removed, after which the site was landscaped with 8,450 trees and 12 acres of new grass. The construction of the power station cost ¬£500,000. Refurbishment and strengthening In the 1980s the station was shut down while repairs and improvements were made. The canal was earthquake strengthened, fitted a with drainage system under the lining and relined with concrete and shotcrete to solve excessive leakage. At the same time erosion below the spillway was repaired with shotcrete, the fastening of the powerhouse's cladding was improved and the penstock supports were strengthened. Diversion banks were also added to control flooding in the event of the bursting of a penstock or the canal and the closing of the canal's intake gate during an earthquake was improved. Design A 36-metre-tall by 118-metre-wide by 70-metre-long rock- fill dam impounds the Kuratau River to create Lake Kuratau, which covers approximately 100 hectares and gives a head of 64 metres. The dam is fitted with a spillway on its western side that can pass up to 110 cumecs down the empty bed of the river. From the south eastern end of the lake a 495-metre- long canal which terminates in a forebay directs the water into two steel penstocks which lead to a surge chamber from which a further two steel penstocks, each 296 metres long convey the water down to a powerhouse located on Kuratau Hydro Rd, Omori. Inside the powerhouse are two 4,000 hp horizontal Boving & Co turbines. Each turbine is directly coupled to a 3 MW, 3 MVA horizontal ASEA three-phase generator. The power station is embedded behind Transpower's Ongarue Substation, but can also be switched within The Lines Company network to either Transpower's National Park or Tokaanu substations. Operation Operation of the power station is covered by the requirements of five resource consents which expire in December 2026. As the power station is located in an area covered in pumice, the intake to the power station requires regular maintenance to remove the pumice which has become dislodged and then floats down the river to build up behind the dam. Lake Kuratau is popular with a range of recreational users, including duck shooters and fly fishermen. The New Zealand Fly Fishing Association frequently uses the lake in its national competitions. In 2009 the lake was used for the Oceania Fly Fishing Championships. Despite covering 100 hectare the lake which created in what is basically a long narrow flooded river valley has a relatively small volume.

Contents Cities of H√¢rn, written by N. Robin Crossby, is a 48-page softcover guide to the seven major cities of the island-continent of H√¢rn. Written three years before the role-playing game Harnmaster was released, this book was not written for any specific game system, allowing the gamemaster to adapt the materials to any role-playing game. An introduction explains the mapping system used in the book, and gives a general account of life in the cities, including lifestyle, government, layout, and taxation. The next section outlines the seven cities, giving complete histories, and typical buildings. There are many maps and blueprints included in the book, using scales that range from 1:2,000,000 to 1:300. Reception Simon Farrell reviewed Cities of H√¢rn for White Dwarf #56, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that \\"Cities of Harn details the seven major cities of the island with some excellent maps.\\" In the November‚ÄìDecember 1984 edition of Space Gamer (No. 71), Steve Jackson gave a thumbs up to this book, saying, \\"All in all, this supplement will be of great interest to those who liked Harn, and is worth a look by any referee in need of city-building ideas. The only real problem, as with other Columbia products, is the price. Many will feel [the price] is too much to pay for a single 64-page book. If that does not deter you, by all means look at Cities of Harn. In the March 1986 edition of Dragon (Issue 107), although Eric Pass complimented the product for being \\"richly detailed and fully consistent\\", he thought that not enough information was provided to run an encounter. He also found the price of the book rather high, but concluded that the book \\"contains well-constructed, consistent, interesting information that will take hours to absorb. Keep a notebook by your side as you read, because you‚Äôll get all sorts of ideas for play.\\" References Category:H√¢rn supplements ","title":"Cities of H√¢rn"},{"id":"60057406","text":"The first season of the action-adventure drama series MacGyver premiered on September 23, 2016, on CBS, for the 2016‚Äì17 American television season.

Sheshadri, based on the Jnanpith Award-winning novel of the same name by K. Shivaram Karanth. The film was produced by Navyachitra Creations and written by P. Sheshadri.  Plot  Mookajji is an eighty-year-old woman who lives in coastal Karnataka. Mookambika, as she was named at birth, was married off as a child before she could attain puberty, but the boy she was married to died within two days of the wedding. As a result, Mookajji now lives in her maternal house with her brother‚Äôs grandson, Subbaraya and his wife Seetha who have two children. Subbaraya discovers that Mookajji has the power of extrasensory perception. She can touch any object or talk to a person and see the history behind that object or person. One day Subbaraya brings a small wicker basket to Mookajji so that she can store her betel nuts in it. Upon touching it, she sees a vision of the history of that basket. She begins to narrate the story of Ramanna and Nagi. Ramanna and Naagi Naagi makes a wicker basket as a sign of affection for her husband Rammana who rejects it. He mistreats Naagi regularly and denies her affectionate advances which saddens her. Naagi is noticed by a rich merchant in the village named Sheenappa who begins to lust after her. He visits her home when Ramanna is absent and propositions her to come to his house. Naagi is reluctant. Refusing to give up, Sheenappa arranges for Ramanna to leave the village for a few days by giving him errands to run in other places. Naagi reluctantly goes to Sheenappa‚Äôs house where they make love. Naagi and Sheenapa continue their affair. Ramanna notices this one day and leaves her. Sheenappa and Naagi soon have a child together. But Naagi notices Sheenappa having an affair with another woman and confronts him. He throws her out of the house along with their infant daughter. Naagi is then forced to make wicker baskets for a living to support herself and her child. Ramanna goes to Naagi to take her back but Naagi refuses saying that she is a defiled woman and cannot return to him. Mookajji finishes narrating the story of Ramanna and Naagi to Subbaraya. She then talks to Ramanna, who is now forty years old, and tells him that it was not just Naagi‚Äôs fault for having the affair and that he was equally to blame for not fulfilling her desires which drove her to have the affair in the first place. A few days later, Seetha sees Naagi and her daughter who are thirsty and invites them to her house to offer them some refreshments. Naagi realises that Mookajji lives there too. When she reaches there, she talks to Mookajji about her plight. Mookajji sends her granddaughter on an errand to deliver a bag to a house and asks Naagi to go as an escort since the house is near a forest. Upon reaching the house, Naagi realises it is Ramanna, her first husband‚Äôs home. Mookajji‚Äôs granddaughter goes to the house and gives the bag to Ramanna who opens it and sees that the bag contains the wicker basket Naagi had made for him. He sees Naagi crying in the distance. He runs to her and they hug each other. Subbaraya continues to bring various artefacts such as old bones and tools he found in a cave. Mookajji tells him the stories behind those objects. They hold discussions about sexuality, nature and other topics. Thippi Later, when Subbaraya plans to visit Hindgana, a neighbouring village, Mookajji asks him to visit her childhood friend Thippi and enquire about her. Subbaraya visits Thippi and they have a conversation where Thippi tells him the story of Mookajji. The film flashes back to the past. Thippi is also widowed when she turns twenty. Mookambika gets angry with the village deity and blames the Goddess for their misfortune. This leads to people labelling Mookambika as crazy and avoiding her. In due course, she comes to terms with her relationship to the Goddess, but when she is at the temple one day, she is rudely told to leave by the temple priest. She leaves with a smile. The film returns to the present. Thippi tells Subbaraya that Mookajji underwent a drastic change that day and stopped talking, except for occasional rants about people accusing them of wrongdoings which would later turn out to be true. Her silence had earned her the name of \\"Mookajji\\" (translation from Kannada: Mooka = Mute; Ajji = Grandmother). Subbaraya continues to bring her artefacts for her to discern its history. One day, Mookajji asks Subbaraya to help take her to the neighbouring village where Thippi resides. They travel to Hindgana where Mookajji and Thippi have an emotional reunion. A few days later, Mookajji asks Subbaraya to escort her to Hindgana to see Thippi right away. Although hesitant at first, Subbaraya agrees to after his wife insists that he make Mookajji as a priority. They go to Hindgana where they see Thippi bedridden. Thippi has not eaten in two days and is about to breathe her last. Mookajji pacifies Thippi and puts her at ease while Thippi passes away. She then asks Subbaraya to arrange for the final rites. Anant Rao Mookajji confronts her grandson‚Äôs friend who has come on a visit to their village. He is a teacher and lives under the pretence of being spiritually inclined, and avoids marriage saying that it will interfere in his life of spiritualism. However, he secretly continues to have a homosexual relationship with a student. When Mookajji questions him about his refusal to be married, he cites his spiritual life as reason for it. Mookajji indicates to him that she is aware of his homosexuality and that he should give up his fa√ßade of being into spirituality and accept himself. This shakes him up. Subbaraya gets a dream one night where he sees Mookajji telling him to throw away a gold chain that he had shown to Mookajji.  Cast  * B.

The physical RangiƒÅtea is somewhere in the Pacific Islands, possibly Ra'iƒÅtea Island in the Society Islands (also known as Tahiti), however, it is not totally certain. Other possible locations are in the Cook Islands. The metaphysical place is considered a font or source of learning and knowledge, especially knowledge handed down by gods, spirit-ancestors, or ancestors. For example, the mythical god-ancestor TƒÅne is said to have received the Baskets of Knowledge from the supreme being Io. These baskets were suspended within a building named RangiƒÅtea. This position as a source of higher learning is reflected in the ancient exhortative proverb: \\"Kia puta ai te ihu ki RangiƒÅtea.\\" 'So that your nose may arrive at RangiƒÅtea.' This expression encourages the individual to pursue study, practice, and mastery of skills to fulfil their potential. Another well-known proverb referring to RangiƒÅtea is this one, which reminds a person that we are all connected to a common source and thus remain united by a commonality: \\"E kore au e ngaro, he kƒÅkano i ruia mai i RangiƒÅtea.\\" 'I shall never be lost, I am a seed sown from RangiƒÅtea.' The metaphorical \\"seed\\" represents growth, development, and self-realization. Linking it to RangiƒÅtea provides that this growth and development is founded in the attainment of higher learning, as handed down by ones' antecedents. RangiƒÅtea is closely related to, and possibly located within, the ancestral homeland of Hawaiki.https://teara.govt.nz/en/hawaiki Several of the ancestral migratory MƒÅori waka (ships) are said to have launched from RangiƒÅtea, namely, Tainuihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tainui_(canoe), Arawahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawa_(canoe), Aoteahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotea_(canoe), and TƒÅkitimuhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TƒÅkitimu_(canoe).

Disassembled bolt of the Heym SR 30\\\\. In breechloading firearms, primary extraction is the initial phase (the first few millimeters) of the extraction of a spent casing from the firearm chamber.Savage Shooters - Primary Extraction: What is it? After the primary extraction comes the secondary extraction where the bolt is moved further backwards,Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair: Gunsmithing at Home - Edward A. Matunas - Google Books and the extraction is then normally finished with the spent cartridge being ejected. The first few millimeters of extraction tend to require a much higher peak force than the rest of the extraction due to the spent casing sticking against the chamber walls. The sticking effect is a result from the case having expanded due to the high temperatures and pressures during firing, and the extra initial force required can, depending on firearm design, make the extraction difficult for the user. Selfloading rifles usually don't have a separate motion for primary extraction, but instead depend on using a lot of force in order to start the extraction. Different designs are used for ensuring reliable extraction in manual mechanisms, with most of them being based on the principle of mechanical advantage. The camming action seen in many bolt action rifles is an example of mechanical advantage being used for chambering and extraction. There are examples of some firearm designs being less successful due to poor design around the primary extraction, which can result in a stuck case in the chamber.Bommarito Rifle ‚Äì Forgotten Weapons Notably some pump and straight pull mechanisms are perceived as having the advantage over bolt actions that they are faster and require fewer body movements to operate by the user, however, they are often more complex than traditional bolt action designs, and often have little or no primary extractionSwiss Straight-Pull First Impressions ‚Äì Forgotten Weapons lacking the mechanical advantage of a turn boltBreak That Case: A Visceral Illustration of Primary Extraction, with Bloke on the Range - The Firearm BlogThe Firearm Blog which can lead to stoppages.

The Heym SR 30 is another successful design which features a bolt with ball bearings as locking elements.

There was an overall erotic element to the album, whose tagline was \\"Titillating Orchestrations for Listening and Loving\\", and whose original cover featured actress and model Diane Webber smiling glamorously underwater, apparently naked. Although not explicitly shown wearing a mermaid tail, her makeup and jewellery are styled to be reminiscent of the performing mermaids at Weeki Wachee Springs. Musically, Jewels of the Sea is characteristic of Baxter's work, with its use of a traditional European orchestra, primarily percussion instruments and strings, combined with more exotic instruments such as electronic keyboard and electric organ. All tracks are original compositions with the exception of \\"The Enchanted Sea\\", an arrangement of Claude Debussy's \\"La mer\\". The mood of the album ranges from upbeat to melancholy, with an overall relaxing effect. The album was generally well- received by critics.

The hospital is part of St. Luke's, a regional healthcare system with six hospitals and more than 200 clinics staffed by roughly 14,000 employees. In 2017 the system received over 55,000 hospital admissions. History The hospital is named for Luke the Evangelist and was dedicated by Bishop Funsten on October 18, 1902, marking St. Luke's Day. Originally a 6-bed facility in a converted 2-story house at the corner of 1st and Bannock Streets, the hospital immediately began to expand with construction of a contagious disease annex. The hospital opened December 8, 1902, and it featured a dining room/office, a private room, a dispensary, and a bathroom on the main floor with an operating room, a ward, and a bathroom on the second floor. In 1903 plans for a new, larger hospital were drawn by the architecture firm of Tourtellotte & Co. Completed and opened late in 1903, the new St. Luke's was a 3-story, brick and stone building capable of treating 25 patients, with sleeping quarters for nurses and a nurses training school. Wayland & Fennell designed a 3-story wing addition in 1906, with plans for a future second wing. The hospital also made plans to demolish its original building, the converted house, and St. Luke's graduated its first class of nurses at the training school. A 9-bed children's hospital was constructed adjacent to the main buildings in 1910. Patients numbered 541 in 1909, and by 1926 the hospital cared for 2005 patients within facilities constructed in 1906. Construction began on a new main hospital building, and in 1928 St. Luke's opened its 4-story building at the corner of 1st and Bannock Streets, adding 67 beds. In 1947 the hospital again faced overcrowding, partly because of an increase in patients with polio. St. Luke's and its neighbor hospital, St. Alphonsus, initiated the United Hospital Fund Campaign with a goal of constructing new, 100-bed facilities at both hospitals. The funding drive raised over $300,000 for each hospital, but by the end of 1949 the funds remained in escrow, unable to cover costs of new construction. Finally in 1950 the hospital broke ground for construction of a new wing. By 1970 a shortage of hospital beds and crowded facilities prompted St. Luke's to consider another expansion. St. Luke's and St. Alphonsus also were urged to consolidate emergency rooms into one facility and obstetrics into another. Later that year, St. Luke's increased its number of hospital beds to 206. In 1977 St. Luke's expanded again with a 5-level building, bringing its number of hospital beds to 300. The hospital became St. Luke's Regional Medical Center in 1980. In 1993 St. Luke's opened the first 4-stories of its 10-story tower that now defines the hospital skyline at N 1st and Bannock Sts. In 1999 a new children's hospital was dedicated in existing buildings at the site. The hospital also opened a large parking garage at the site. The hospital expanded its emergency department in 2001. In 2009 a medical office building was approved by city planners. The building would be connected by skybridge to the east wing of the hospital along Avenue B. The project proposal became part of a larger expansion plan in 2014 that includes a new building with 60 beds, laboratory space, and cardiac care facilities north of E Jefferson St., directly behind the existing hospital. By 2015 the expansion plan had grown to a 4-phase proposal to occur over several decades. Groundbreaking for phase one, a children's hospital pavilion at Avenue B and E Jefferson St., began in 2016. In 2017 a 98-foot giant sequoia, planted in 1912, was moved from the hospital grounds to provide space for construction. St. Luke's began moving historic homes away from its second E Jefferson St. construction site in 2018. The hospital is considered a 604-bed hospital when combined with its 167-bed hospital in Meridian.

The three disease types are drug overdose (including alcohol overdose), suicide, and alcoholic liver disease. Diseases of despair, and the resulting deaths of despair, are high in the Appalachia region of the United States. The prevalence increased markedly during the first decades of the 21st century, especially among middle-aged and older working class white Americans starting in 2010, followed by an increase in mortality for Hispanic Americans in 2011 and African Americans in 2014. It gained media attention because of its connection to the opioid epidemic. For 2018, some 158,000 U.S. citizens died from these causes, compared to 65,000 in 1995.  Risk factors  Although addiction and depression affect people of every age, every ethnicity, and every demographic group, the excess mortality and morbidity from diseases of despair affects a smaller group. In the US, the group most affected by these diseases of despair are non-Hispanic white men and women who have not attended university. Compared to previous generations, this group is less likely to be married, less likely to be working, less likely to be able to provide for their families, and more likely to report physical pain, overall poor health, and mental health problems, such as depression.  Causes  The factors that seem to exacerbate diseases of despair are not fully known, but they are generally recognized as including a worsening of economic inequality and feeling of hopelessness about personal financial success. This can take many forms and appear in different situations. For example, people feel inadequate and disadvantaged when products are marketed to them as being important, but these products repeatedly prove to be unaffordable for them. The overall loss of employment in affected geographic regions, and the worsening of pay and working conditions along with the decline of labor unions, is a widely hypothesized factor. The changes in the labor market also affect social connections that might otherwise provide protection, as people at risk for this problem are less likely to get married, more likely to get divorced, and more likely to experience social isolation. Economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton argue that the ultimate cause is the sense that life is meaningless, unsatisfying, or unfulfilling, rather than strictly the basic economic security that makes these higher order feelings more likely. Diseases of despair differ from diseases of poverty because poverty itself is not the central factor. Groups of impoverished people with a sense that their lives or their children's lives will improve are not affected as much by diseases of despair. Instead, this affects people who have little reason to believe that the future will be better. As a result, this problem is distributed unevenly, for example by affecting working-class people in the United States more than working-class people in Europe, even when the European economy was weaker. It also affects white people more than racially disadvantaged groups, possibly because working-class white people are more likely to believe that they are not doing better than their parents did, while non-white people in similar economic situations are more likely to believe that they are better off than their parents.  Effects  Starting in 1998, a rise in deaths of despair has resulted in an unexpected increase in the number of middle-aged white Americans dying (the age-specific mortality rate). By 2014, the increasing number of deaths of despair had resulted in a drop in overall life expectancy. Anne Case and Angus Deaton propose that the increase in mid-life mortality is the result of cumulative disadvantages that have occurred over decades, and that solving it will require patience and perseverance for many years, rather than a quick fix that produces immediate results. The number of deaths of despair in the United States has been estimated at 150,000 per year in 2017.  Terminology  The name diseases of despair has been criticized for being unfair to the people who are adversely affected by social and economic forces beyond their control, and for underplaying the role of specific drugs, such as OxyContin, in increasing deaths.

He specialized in history painting, but is also known for his postage stamp designs.  Biography  His father was a carpenter. At the time of his birth, Zastavna was part of Austria- Hungary, so his primary education was conducted in German and Romanian. For his secondary studies, he went to Chernivtsi. One of his instructors there was the Ukrainian artist Yustyn Pigulyak, who discovered and encouraged his talent for art by giving him free lessons. Before long, he had decided to become a history painter. In 1884, he was able to gain admission to the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna. While there, he participated in student excursions to the Ternopil region, where he became acquainted with the nobleman, and painted portraits of his family. After graduating, he was recommended to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, to complete his education.. While there, he met the Russian artist, Ilya Repin, who advised him to establish himself in Kyiv. Hryvnia postage stamp Hel held his first exhibition in Chernivtsi, where he displayed genre works as well as historical scenes. In 1899, he established a school there for \\"talented but poor youth\\", which he operated until 1908, when he took Repin's advice about Kyiv. Just prior to World War I, however, the government of Bukovina offered him the sum of 1000 Crowns to establish another art school in Chernivtsi, so he returned. He also opened a workshop for icon painting. It was there that he executed his most famous work; \\"The Entrance of Bogdan Khmelnytsky to Kyiv in 1649\\", a reproduction of which was once a common sight in Ukrainian homes. As a supporter of Ukrainian independence, he created many similar paintings, but most of them were lost years later when he once again went to Kyiv. In 1919, the Directorate of Ukraine commissioned him to design postage stamps for the Ukrainian People's Republic. He produced fourteen designs altogether and they were printed in 1921 but, shortly after, the Soviets took control of Ukraine and they were never used. In 1926 Vlas Chubar, Chairman of the People's Commissariat of Ukraine, invited him and his student, , to become professors at the Kyiv Art Institute. Lipetskiy was wary of the Soviets and refused the offer; advising Ivasyuk to do the same. He accepted, however, and moved his family there the same year. They were immediately granted Soviet citizenship. The Entrance of Bogdan Khmelnytsky to Kyiv in 1649 At first, he was honored and praised but soon, following instructions from Moscow, he began to be criticized; initially for small things, then for more serious matters. Eventually, he was transferred to Odessa, where he came under harsh criticism for \\"bourgeois deviations\\". Finally, it was forbidden to mention his name. In September, 1937, the NKVD conducted a search of his apartment and found nothing incriminating. He was arrested, nevertheless, and taken to Lukyanivska Prison. The following month, he was formally accused of being a terrorist and an agent of German intelligence. He refused to confess. In November, he was convicted and, eleven days later, executed by firing squad. All of his personal property was confiscated and destroyed.–°—Ç–∞—Ç—Ç—è –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç—ñ –Ü–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ù–ê–ù–£ His remains were returned to Bukovina.

Battle in the Adi Ghar Mountains On the 27 January, a patrol of US Special Forces accompanied by Afghan militia fighters came under small arms fire while clearing a compound approximately 13 kilometers North of Spin Boldak at 11:00 am. The US and Afghan forces returned fire, after the small skirmish, one enemy was dead, another wounded, and a third was captured. After interrogating, the captured fighter claimed that 80 fighters were hiding in the Adi Ghar Mountains, wanting to verify these claims, the US Special Forces dispatched two Apache helicopters to the area, taking them 26 minutes to reach the area, upon receiving fire the Apaches called for assistance from B-1B bombers, AC-130 Spectre gunships and Norwegian F-16s, making it the first time the Norwegian Air Force had seen combat since World War II. On the ground, a joint force of at least 350, including US soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division and Special Forces, alongside coalition and Afghan militia troops were called to the area to participate in the operation.

The railroad would begin in Palenque in Chiapas and travel northeast towards Canc√∫n in Quintana Roo via two routes that encircle the peninsula and a route that goes to Mexico City and stop at 15 stations. The project aims to connect tourist destinations in the Yucat√°n, including historic Mayan sites from which it derives its name. History The Mayan Train project was announced in September 2018 by Mexican president-elect Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, following earlier proposals to build a shorter line. Previous presidential administrations had also proposed their own high- speed rail projects, but were unsuccessful in attaining funding. It would use abandoned right of way from Ferrosur as well as new tracks constructed through the jungle, which caused outcry from environmental and indigenous rights activists. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation, announced that it would oppose the project. The project was also derided as a political stunt for L√≥pez Obrador, who had also cancelled a major airport project in Mexico City favored by his predecessor. A public referendum on approving the project in November 2018 was passed by 89 percent of voters with a turnout of approximately one percent. On December 16, 2018, president L√≥pez Obrador conducted a Mayan ritual to commemorate the start of construction on the Mayan Train project. The project, led by the National Fund for Tourism Development, is estimated to cost 150 billion pesos (US$7.4 billion) and attract 8,000 daily riders. An alternative study by a public policy think tank in 2019 estimated the cost of the project would be 480 billion pesos (US$25.3 billion), supported by the 90 percent cost overrun on the Toluca‚ÄìMexico City railway project. Funding for the project will come primarily from a tourism tax levied in the region, as well as funds diverted from other programs, including the Mexican Grand Prix. The railway will also accommodate local passenger traffic and freight shipments in addition to tourist functions. The first phase of the project is anticipated to open in the late 2020s, but tourism officials in the region have proposed accelerating work for a 2023 opening. December 2019 consultation On November 15, 2019, President L√≥pez Obrador declared that a referendum on the Mayan Train would be held on December 15, 2019 in Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucat√°n, and Quintana Roo.Gobierno inicia proceso de consulta ciudadana e ind√≠gena para Tren Maya; se realizar√° el 15 diciembre Aristegui Noticias, Nov 15, 2019 The weekend of December 15‚Äì16, 2019, 92.3% of the people who participated in the consultation voted in favor, while 7.4% voted against the proposal. 100,940 people voted, 2.36% of the 3,536,000 registered voters in the 84 municipalities affected. The United Nations Human Rights Council sharply criticized the vote. They pointed out that voters were provided with only the positive effects of the project (improved attention to water supplies, health, education, employment, housing, environmental protection, and culture) but were not informed of the negative effects. The Human Rights Commission also criticized the translations of the material used, the short period of time for the election, and low turnout, particularly among indigenous women. They noted that many potential voters did not have the financial resources to travel to the voting locations, and that the majority of voters were municipal employees. For its part, the government rejected the criticisms, saying that the consultation met international standards and attacked ‚Äúla descalificaci√≥n ni la cr√≠tica simple, sin sustento, ligera y parcializada‚Äù. (\\"the light and biased disqualification or simple criticism, without support\\"). 2020 On the 26th anniversary of its armed uprising, January 1, 2020, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation expressed its opposition to the project and declared that the consultation provided only positive information to voters prior to voting.EZLN reitera rechazo a megaproyectos de AMLO El Segundero, Jan 1, 2020 Groups close to the National Indigenous Congress plan to seek injunctions against the train project and other megaprojects in the region. The CNI is looking at three- pronged action: social awareness campaigns, media campaigns, and legal actions. On January 28, 2020, a judge in Campeche issued a temporary injunction against construction of the railway because was approved in a \\"simulated consultation.\\" In a visit to the city of Campeche, President L√≥pez Obrador defended the train and pointed out that not only had the train received its greatest support in the state of Campeche, but also that more than half the route would run through the state‚Äîworth MXN $60 billion of the $130 billion the government plans to invest in total. He said the section from Esc√°rcega to Canc√∫n should be open for tourist, passenger, and freight traffic in 2023, but that the route will not pass through the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. Business leaders in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, expressed their support on January 31, 2020, for building four kilometers of the railway underground as it passes through the city of Merida. In this way, the train will not threaten the city's historic center. They are also optimistic that the tourist train, in combination with improvements in energy, airports, and seaports, will make the region economically competitive with the North and the Baj√≠o. The construction companies are Mota-Engil M√©xico SAPI and China Communications Construction Company LTD for stretch one (Plenque-Esc√°rcega), Operadora CICSA and FCC Construcci√≥n for stretch two (Esc√°rcega-Calkin√≠), Construcciones Urales and GAMI Ingenier√≠a e Instalaciones for stretch three (Calkin√≠-Izmal), and Grupo ICA for stretch four (Izmal ‚ÄìCanc√∫n). The Fondo Nacional de Fomento Tur√≠stico (Fonatur) announced on September 8, 2020, that the proposal of investment firm BlackRock for the fifth stretch () of the project, including improvements to the Tulum-Canc√∫n highway, had been rejected. The Secretariat of Tourism will receive a 647.1% increase in its budget for 2021 (MXN $38,613.4 million), of which 94% is destined for the Mayan Train. In October 2020 the estimated total cost of the project not including electrification was about 321 billion pesos. Environmental concerns The National Alliance for Conservation of the Jaguar has identified twelve wildlife corridors that could be constructed to mitigate the situation for the jaguars that live in the area. Original plans called for electric locomotives on the trains. In June 2020 the government announced a switch to diesel to keep costs down, then in August 2020 they announced that half the route would be electrified.

(Mike) Kozak (born 1946) is a diplomat in the United States Department of State, currently serving as Acting Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs. He previously served as U.S. Ambassador to Belarus between 2000 and 2003 and chief of mission at the United States Interests Section in Havana between 1996 and 1999, and was a nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador in 1991. He achieved a measure of prominence in the 1980s for his attempts to negotiate with Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega to leave power. Kozak is a civil service employee of the U.S. State Department and charter member of the Senior Executive Service. He has been described as a problem solver with practical solutions, who is \\"not prone to ideological diatribes.\\" He also been called \\"an outgoing, let's roll-up-our-sleeves kind of guy with a square boxer's body and face\\" and \\"pugnacious.\\" Diplomatic work 1970s international negotiation and mediation During the 1970s, Kozak served as a negotiator on the Panama Canal Treaties during the Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations. He then participated in the multilateral efforts to mediate an end to the Nicaraguan civil war in 1978-1979, and was a member of the U.S. mediation team that implemented the Egypt-Israel peace treaty and sought a solution to the Lebanese Civil War. Cuba In the 1980s, Kozak was heavily involved in Cuba issues at the State Department, in its American Republic Affairs unit. In April 1980, as the State Department determined its policies toward the Mariel boatlift of Cuban refugees to the United States, and formulated its statements on possible prosecution of Cuban Americans and hired ships bringing family members from Cuba to the United States, Kozak wrote a memo outlining various options for dealing with migration of Cuban refugees. The memo included points that could be used to justify a decision to prohibit entry. Kozak noted that prosecutions for bringing Cubans to the United States in the past were rare, and that unless the government were prepared to demonstrate its willingness to do so, Cuban Americans would assume there was no serious risk in participating in the boatlift. In 1980 and 1981, Kozak was part of a State Department team meeting with Cuban officials over migration and other issues. Between 1982 and 1988, Kozak became a principal deputy assistant secretary of state level official in the Office of the Legal Advisor. In 1984, Kozak was the legal advisor in the State Department's delegation that met at a midtown Manhattan hotel (while registered under pseudonyms to avoid attention) with Cuba's Vice Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarc√≥n. Legal recourse against terrorism attacks While working as principal deputy legal advisor, Kozak originated an idea to settle a dispute between the U.S. government and the Chilean government over the killing of a former Chilean diplomat in exile in the United States, Orlando Letelier, and his American assistant Ronni Moffit in a 1976 car bombing near Dupont Circle in Washington, DC. As Chile was unwilling to submit to a determination by a U.S. tribunal, Kozak proposed invoking the arbitration clause of the 1914 Chile-United States peace treaty, and Chile agreed. In October 1985, Kozak testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs about recourse available to the United States government and U.S. citizens for the Achille Lauro terrorist attack. Panama and Noriega and Central America Between 1988 and 1991, Kozak held a principal deputy assistant secretary of state role in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. In 1988, Kozak was a special presidential envoy who \\"achieved prominence ... when he led an unsuccessful effort to persuade then-Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega to agree to a democratic transfer of power\\" prior to the U.S. military deposing Noriega in December 1989. In early 1988, Kozak had been sent to Panama repeatedly to try to negotiate on behalf of the U.S. government directly with Panamanian President Manuel Noriega, attempting to settle on terms under which Noreiga would step down. Kozak argued for a diplomatic arrangement under which indictment against Noriega would be quashed, sanctions would be lifted, and Noriega would step down and leave the country by August 1988. After word leaked, the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate measure that the indictment should not be dropped, and Vice President George H.W. Bush denounced the negotiations. Kozak continued with the talks and delivered an ultimatum for Noreiga to agree to by May 25, 1988, but Noriega refused and the U.S. military eventually invaded the country. In March 1989, as acting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Kozak advocated before Congress for funding for diplomatic efforts in Latin America. He also helped Secretary of State James Baker implement a bipartisan agreement on Central America designed to help end the conflict in Nicaragua. In 1989, as principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs,working with Bernard Aronson, Kozak argued before a House hearing that relations with Cuba should not improve until the Castro regime made concessions to the United States on a variety of concerns. The next year, Kozak was instrumental in promoting ICITAP as the appropriate organization to train the Panamanian Defense Forces for civil law enforcement work after the overthrow of Manuel Noriega, with mixed results. U.S. ambassador to El Salvador nomination In April 1991, Kozak was nominated to be U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador. His appointment, and that of Joseph Sullivan to be ambassador to Nicaragua, were blocked by Republican Senator Jesse Helms and Democratic Senator Chris Dodd, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee. Their staffs had disapproved of the way in which the State Department had notified the committee of a particular programs, and held Sullivan and Kozak responsible as deputy assistant secretaries at the time. They also disliked the way in which Kozak had helped resolve the Contra situation in Nicaragua. Chief of Mission in Cuba In 1996, Kozak, as the new chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, led a 100th anniversary commemoration of the sinking of the U.S.S. Maine, hosted American media at his house during a visit by the Pope, and interfaced with the Cuban Ministry of the Interior when requesting their information on a group allegedly financed by Cuban Americans that attempted attacks in Cuba. Haiti In March 1993, Kozak was a deputy to U.S. Special Advisor Lawrence Pezzullo on issues related to Haiti and the deposition of Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He was invited by the new Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs Alexander Watson to join the Haiti Working Group, where they worked in underfunded office space with furniture from the 1950s, peeling paint, and outdated Wang word processors. Kozak, as special negotiator, along with Pezzullo, was responsible for communications with Aristide, the Haitian military, the UN, and the White House. During meetings with cabinet ministers in Haiti, Kozak would coax them into taking action. He also pushed officials with the United Nations Mission in Haiti to move against human rights violators. In September 1994, Kozak accompanied General Colin Powell on a flight to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, less than 36 hours before the planned landing of American troops there, to convince the leader of the ruling military junta that had taken control, Raoul Cedras, to leave power. U.S. ambassador to Belarus On April 6, 2000, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Kozak to be U.S. Ambassador to Belarus. President Alexander Lukashenko made Kozak wait several months before arranging for Kozak to present his credentials for official recognition as ambassador. In 2001, Kozak and Hans Georg Vik, the head of OSCE mission in Minsk, pushed for political opposition parties in Belarus to unite around a single leader, Uladzimir Hancharyk, the leader of the Trade Union Federation. Hancharyk did not gain widespread popular support, and was seen as a \\"remnant of the old Soviet days of privilege and Party control\\". Combined with ballot stuffing for the incumbent president, economic priming, and a crackdown on election observers, NGOs, and political activists, the central election commission controlled by President Lukashenko declared him the winner with 75.6 percent of the vote, a result contested as false and fraudulent by international bodies and other countries. In November 2002, Kozak spoke before a conference in Washington, DC sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute and charged that Belarus President Lukashenko was illegally selling arms to the regime of Saddam Hussein. Human Rights Between 2003 and 2005, Kozak held a principal deputy assistant secretary of state role in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. In 2004, Kozak testified before the House Committee on Government Reform on the human rights situation in the Indian- Pakistani disputed area of Kashmir. Between 2005 and 2009, Kozak was a senior director on the National Security Council staff, with responsibility for democracy, human rights, international organizations, migration and detainee issues. He authored the first National Security Presidential Directive on democracy and human rights since the Carter administration. Between 2009 and 2017, Kozak was senior adviser to the Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, where he worked to negotiate a UN resolution on ‚ÄúDefamation of Religions‚Äù that respected freedom of expression. Between October 2012 and May 2013, Kozak served as Acting Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism, between Hannah Rosenthal and Ira Forman. Between September 2017 and September 2019, Kozak held the title of Senior Bureau Official for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Personal Kozak is of Czech ancestry. He received his bachelor's degree in political science at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1968, and his J.D. degree at Boalt Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971, where he was assistant managing editor of the California Law Review.

While at Howard, Butler was mentored by members of AfriCOBRA and she has stated that her color scheme is in line with their aesthetic. She has also been inspired by the figurative textile works of Faith Ringgold. She has stated that her work is reminiscent of the African American quilting tradition originating from enslaved people using scraps of fabric to make quilts to stay warm. She often uses African fabrics in her work, so her subjects are \\"adorned with and made up of the cloth of our ancestor.\\" The artist likes her art to ‚Äútell stories that may have been forgotten over time.‚Äù https://mymodernmet.com/bisa-butler-african-fabric-portrait-quilts/ Her quilts often feature portraits of famous figures in black history, such as Paul Laurence Dunbar, Jackie Robinson, Frederick Douglass, and Josephine Baker. She uses a variety of patterned fabrics, which she carefully selects to reflect the subject's life, sometimes using clothing worn by the subject. Her portrait of Nina Simone, for example, is made of cotton, silk, velvet, and netting, while that of Jean-Michel Basquiat is made of leather, cotton, and vintage denim. Along with her portraits of notable figures, Butler also creates pieces featuring everyday, unknown African American subjects that she bases off of found photographs. She describes her fascination for her nameless subjects' unknown stories: \\"I feel these people; I know these stories because I have grown up with them my whole life.\\" She strives \\"to bring as many of these unnamed peoples photos to the forefront\\" so \\"people will see these ordinary folks as deserving of a spotlight too.\\" Her pieces are done in life scale in order \\"to invite the viewer to engage in dialogue--most figures look the viewers directly in their eyes.\\"  Exhibitions  She has exhibited widely. In 2018 she exhibited at EXPO Chicago and was praised in Newcity and the Chicago Reader. In February 2019 her work was included along with that of Romare Bearden in The Art of Jazz, a Black History Month exhibition in Morristown, New Jersey. Butler's quilts are featured in art books such as Journey of Hope: Quilts Inspired by President Barack Obama (2010) and Collaborations: Two Decades of African American Art : Hearne Fine Art 1988-2008 (2008), and on websites such as Blavity and Colossal. In 2019, she was a finalist for the Museum of Art and Design's Burke Prize. Butler's first solo museum exhibition, \\"Bisa Butler: Portraits,\\" was scheduled to be held at the Katonah Museum of Art from March 15 to June 14, 2020; however after temporarily closing due to health concerns the exhibition was extended to October 4, 2020.\\"Exhibitions,\\" Katonamuseum.org, retrieved July 26, 2020.\\"Katonah Museum of Art to Reopen July 26,\\" TAPinto, July 17, 2020.

The Catholic Church in Chile in 2018 suffered one of the worst of the worldwide Catholic sexual abuse cases, including the Fernando Karadima case, resulting in several convictions and resignations. The Vatican sexual abuse summit, officially the Meeting on the Protection of Minors in the Church (), was a four-day Catholic Church summit meeting in Vatican City that ran from 21 to 24 February 2019, convened by Pope Francis to discuss preventing sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy.  Background  Cases of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests, nuns and members of religious orders in the 20th and 21st centuries have led to many allegations, investigations, trials and convictions as well as revelations about decades of attempts by the Church to cover up reported incidents.Tara Isabella Burton, New Catholic sex abuse allegations show how long justice can take in a 16-year scandal, Vox, 20 August 2018 Many bishops and religious superiors have denied the existence or downplay the severity of sexual abuse cases in an attempt to preserve the reputation of their priests and the church. During Pope Francis' visit to Chile in January 2018, he defended a Chilean bishop from charges of sexual abuse, stating that accusations without evidence was simply slander. The massive public outcry in response to Francis' words prompted him to open a new Vatican investigation into the case, assigning Archbishop Charles J. Scicluna to the task. Upon realizing his mistake following results of the investigation, Francis apologized in person to the victims of the case, and summoned the Chilean bishop conference to Rome to discuss the failures of the Church hierarchy. The meeting concluded with all 34 Chilean bishops offering their resignations in writing. The following June, it was revealed that the Archdiocese of New York had found two accusations of child sexual abuse against the see's former Auxiliary Bishop, Theodore McCarrick, \\"credible and substantiated.\\" Several of McCarrick's former victims spoke out over the following months, and a seminary formerly under his purview was placed under investigation following reports of widespread sexual misconduct in the Diocese of Metuchen and the Archdioceses of Newark and Washington D.C.https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the- usa/2018/09/26/bishops-to-investigate-4-dioceses-after-pope-nixes-vatican- mccarrick-probe/ McCarrick lost the title of Cardinal after being found guilty of the allegations by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. On August 14, a grand jury report from the Pennsylvania Attorney General was released which detailed over 1,000 child victims of sexual abuse by around 300 priests in six of the state's dioceses between the 1960s and the present. While describing the abuse, the report also indicated that several bishops responsible who oversaw those dioceses at the time were still in office. Following the report's release, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, citing both the revelations around McCarrick and those in the Grand Jury Report as a \\"moral catastrophe,\\" called for a Vatican investigation into the American church with the aim to bring about \\"practical changes to avoid repeating the sins and failures of the past.\\" On August 25, former apostolic nuncio to the United States Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤ released an 11-page \\"testimony\\" in which he accused several churchmen, including Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C. and Pope Francis, of having known of the accusations against McCarrick years prior and failing to act appropriately on them. The retired nuncio called on Francis to resign.  Announcement  On 12 September 2018, Paloma Garc√≠a Ovejero, the vice director of the Vatican press office, announced Pope Francis' decision to call a global summons for a meeting on clergy sexual abuse. Francis made the decision during a meeting of his advisory Council of Cardinals. The meeting would occur at the Vatican from 21 to 24 February 2019, and would include religious superiors and all the presidents of the world's bishops' conferences. The Vatican said that the theme of the meeting would be \\"the protection of minors\\". The summit was described as \\"unprecedented\\" and \\"the first of its kind\\".  Pre-summit events  Ahead of the Vatican summit, the November 2018 U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Fall Assembly was considering its own proposals for procedures on how to handle bishops who have either abused children or who have been negligent in discliplining abusive priests. During this meeting, the Congregation for Bishops requested that any votes on such procedures be dalayed. Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, the president of the conference, expressed disappointment with the intervention. The Vatican was worried that decisions that agreed upon by American bishops could preempt discussions at the worldwide summit in February, possibly leading to perceived infringements on the authority of the Vatican by other parties. In response to the intervention from the Vatican, Cardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago, suggested that they continue discussing the proposals, and pass them to DiNardo as recommendations that he could then take to the summit in February. Speaking with reporters on 27 January 2019, Pope Francis stated that the summit was intended to be a \\"catechesis\\" on the problem of abuse for the bishops who do not understand the issue or who are unsure how to handle the issue. In the summit, he would seek to impress the severity of the issue of abuse and clarify the role that the bishops must play in response to abuse. On 18 February 2019, organizer Archbishop Scicluna stated that the summit would not solve all the problems. He said however that it would be reasonable to expect follow up, as this would be \\"of the essence\\". When asked if the summit would focus on abuse of minors or if it would also discuss abuse of seminarians and adults, organizer Cardinal Cupich said that they would be focusing on minors. He reasoned: \\"We are focusing in these days on those who have so little voice. Young people, minors, don't have a voice. This is about making sure that their voice is heard.\\"  Summit meeting  The summit ran from Thursday 21 through Sunday 24 February 2019. The invited delegation, numbering approximately 190, was primarily male. Of the participants, 10 were religious sisters, and 3 were women who would address the meeting. The participants also included 114 presidents of bishops' conferences, 14 leaders of Oriental Catholic Churches, 22 superiors of men and women religious, 14 members of the Vatican Curia, and 15 additional bishops and cardinals. The summit consisted of lectures and workshops on preventing sexual abuse, handling victims, and investigating abuse. The four days were divided into three thematic days, and one final day for Mass and a concluding address. The 1st day focused on responsibility, the 2nd day focused on accountability, and the 3rd day focused on transparency. During the summit, victims of abuse gathered in Rome to protest, shouting \\"Zero tolerance!\\" Among the protestors was Alberto Athie of Mexico, one of the original accusers against Rev. Marcial Maciel.  Day 1: Responsibility  Pope Francis opened the summit by warning the attending bishops and religious superiors that their constituents were demanding concrete actions, not just words. Francis said, \\"The holy people of God are watching and expect not just simple and obvious condemnations, but efficient and concrete measures to be established.\\" He offered a list of 21 proposals to consider going forward. Bishops watched videotaped testimony of five victims from Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and North America speaking about the trauma of their abuse. One victim from Chile said that when he came forward about his abuse, he was discredited and told that he was the enemy of the church. A victim from Africa spoke about how, from the age of 15, her priest would beat her if she refused to have sex with him. She got pregnant three times, and he forced her to have an abortion every time. A victim from Asia talked about how her religious superiors would cover up the abuse of nuns.  Day 2: Accountability  Cardinals called for more accountability in the Catholic Church. Cardinal Blase J. Cupich called for transparent legal procedures on how to report and investigate those accused of abuse and those negligent in handling abuse cases. He elaborated upon his \\"metropolitan model\\" proposal, in which metropolitan bishops would investigate suspected abuse with the consultation of lay experts, and then submit the results to the Vatican. He first brought up this proposal in response to the Vatican blocking the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops from voting on local American proposals on better handling sexual abuse cases the previous November.  Day 3: Transparency  German Cardinal Reinhard Marx admitted that in his own diocese files that documented sexual abuse of children were missing. He added that he did not think this was an isolated case. At times, church administration failed to create the appropriate documentation in the first place, and the procedures for prosecuting offenses were often cancelled and overridden. Marx stressed the need for transparency and traceability, so that abuse cases can be followed by victims and Catholics. Marx also condemned the use of pontifical secrecy to suppress abuse cases. Veteran Vatican journalist Valentina Alazraki told gathered bishops, \\"if you do not decide in a radical way to be on the side of the children, mothers, families, civil society, you are right to be afraid of us, because we journalists, who seek the common good, will be your worst enemies.\\"  Day 4: Papal priorities  Pope Francis ended the summit with a half-hour speech that included condemnations of the abuses by clergy and cautions against being too extreme in response to the crisis. During the speech, he said clergy who abuse children are \\"tools of Satan\\" and that such criminal behavior is \\"utterly incompatible with [the church's] moral authority and ethical credibility.\\" However, in addressing the abuse, he said that the church must avoid falling into the extreme of \\"justicialism\\". Francis also discussed the wider impact of abuse, citing a 2017 UNICEF study on abuse in 28 countries. Francis ended his speech by stating an eight-point list of priorities. The list included a call to prioritize victims of abuse over the institution's reputation, and a call to stop the cover-ups and trivialization of abuses. Rev. Federico Lombardi, moderator for the summit, announced that the Vatican would soon issue Vatican City State policies for child protection and guidelines for preventing sexual abuse of minors. Vatican City had no such policies in place previously. The Holy See had previously asked bishops conferences around the world to write up such child protection guidelines in 2011, and it had told the United Nations in 2014 that such guidelines were in the process of being written. Lombardi also said that they would create task forces of \\"competent persons\\" to help dioceses and episcopal conferences who experience difficulty in addressing the problems. At the closing Mass, the Australian Archbishop Mark Coleridge said bishops and priests will not act alone, but will work with all concerned for the good of the young and the vulnerable. ‚ÄúAll of this will take time‚Äù, he said, ‚Äúbut we do not have forever and we dare not fail.‚Äù  Reactions  Pope Francis delivered the summit's closing remarks. Reaction to the summit was mixed, with some praising the steps taken by the Vatican, and others criticizing the program as too narrow or not comprehensive enough. In response to the initial announcement in September 2018, David Clohessy, former director of the victims‚Äô advocacy group SNAP, expressed doubt that anything good would come of the meeting, citing decades of failure to reform. Christopher Bellitto, a church historian at Kean University in New Jersey, praised the action of holding a summit, but thought that it should occur more quickly than in six months. Massimo Faggioli, a professor of historical theology at Villanova University, noted how this conference represented a change of course from how the previous pontiffs had placed more emphasis on the authority of the individual bishop over the bishop conference. He said that the abuse crisis has changed this, resulting in a rebalancing. Some critics accused the summit of being too narrowly focused on the abuse of minors at the expense of sexual misconduct and coercion by adults. JD Flynn, a canon lawyer and editor-in-chief of Catholic News Agency, noted that the gathering \\"doesn't aim to\\" resolve issues that largely plagued the church after the revelations regarding McCarrick. Flynn posed the question, \\"Will Catholics accept the presupposition that those who sexually abuse 17-year-olds have an entire different moral or psychological pathology than those who sexually abuse 18-year-olds, or who coerce them into the veneer of consent against the backdrop of an extraordinary power imbalance?\\" Some commentators questioned whether the steps taken at the summit would lead to greater accountability of bishops and thus prevent such a situation as arose with McCarrick. For Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, Francis' closing speech was a \\"stunning letdown\\". She elaborated, \\"We needed him to offer a bold and decisive plan. He gave us instead defensive, recycled rhetoric.\\" Tim Lennon, the head of SNAP, said that he felt Pope Francis' ending remarks were inadequate. He said, \\"We‚Äôve heard this condemnation, the apologies, the penance, the fasting, but they are all words. Unless he starts to fire a bishop who covered up sexual abuse and there are known, proven bishops, who have done that, then it just rings hollow.\\" Critics said that the summit was an inadequate response to an ongoing crisis some victims said children were not safer in a meaningful way, and that the issue of accountability for bishops who covered up abuse was inadequately addressed. Follow-up 2019 Vatican norms On March 26, 2019, one month after the summit was held, Pope Francis adopted: * Vatican Law No. CCXCVII On the protection of minors and vulnerable persons; * the Motu Proprio On the protection of minors and vulnerable persons; * the Guidelines of the Vicariate of Vatican City on the protection of minors and vulnerable persons. According to Andrea Tornielli, these: Law No. CCXCVII requiries Vatican City officials, including those in the Roman Curia, and diplomatic personnel of the Holy See, such as the Apostolic Nuncios, to report sex abuse. Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros (about $5,600) or, in the case of a Vatican gendarme, up to six months in prison. In addition, all crimes related to child abuse, including mistreatment, are persecutable ‚Äúex officio‚Äù, even when the purported victim does not file an official report. The law also extends the statute of limitations to 20-year prescription that, in the case of and offence against a minor, begin to count from on his or her eighteenth birthday. In addition, the Governorate of the Vatican City State is required to set up, within the Vatican Department of Health and Welfare, service to support and assist the victims of abuse, providing them with medical and psychological assistance and informing them of their rights and of how to enforce them. The motu proprio extends the application of the Vatican law to the Roman Curia and its personnel. It requires that, when recruiting staff, the candidate's suitability to interact with minors must be ascertained. The Guidelines for the Vicariate of Vatican City are addressed to the canons, parish priests and coadjutors of the two parishes located within the Vatican, as well as to the priests, deacons and educators of the Saint Pius X Pre- Seminary, to all the religious men and women who reside in the Vatican, and to all those who work within the ecclesiastical community of the Vicariate of Vatican City. The guidelines require that, in the course of pastoral activities, those persons must always be visible to others when they are in the presence of minors, and that it is strictly forbidden to establish a preferential relationship with a single minor, to address a minor in an offensive way or to engage in inappropriate or sexually allusive conduct, to ask a minor to keep a secret, to photograph or to film a minor without the written consent of his parents. The Vicar of Vatican City has also the obligation to report to the Promoter of Justice any news of abuse that is not manifestly unfounded, and to remove the alleged perpetrator of the abuse from pastoral activities as a precautionary measure. The Motu Proprio Vos estis lux mundi On May 9, 2019, Pope Francis issued the Motu Proprio Vos estis lux mundi requiring both clerics and religious brothers and sisters, including Bishops, throughout the world to report sex abuse cases and sex abuse cover-ups by their superiors. Under the new Motu Proprio, all Catholic dioceses throughout the world are required to establish stable mechanisms or systems through which people may submit reports of abuse or its cover-up by June 2020. All metropolitan Archdioceses are also required to send reports to the Holy See on the progress of the investigation, whether in their Archdiocese or suffragan dioceses, every 30 days and to complete the investigation within 90 days unless granted an extension. The law is effective for a 3-year experimental period with a vacatio legis of 1 June 2019. According to Canon law professor Kurt Martens:  The Rescript \\"On the confidentiality of legal proceedings\\"  On December 17, 2019 Pope Francis issued a canon law instruction \\"On the confidentiality of legal proceedings\\" lifting the \\"pontifical secret\\" in the cases relating to: violence or abuse of authority in forcing sexual acts, sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable persons, crimes of paedophilia involving children under 18 years of age or with incapacitated subjects and the concealment of those conducts from ecclesiastical or civil inquiries. Under the new provisions, are excluded from the pontifical secret all the stages of the canonical trials, from the denunciation, to the phase of the preliminary investigations, to the phase of the proper debate, and up to the final decision, as well as any witness statements and documents produced in trial. It concerns both the procedures that take place at the local level, and those that take place in Rome, at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2019/12/17/191217f.html The instruction provides however that the information obtain in a canonical trial be treated in such a way as to ensure its security, integrity and confidentiality with a view to protecting the good name, image and privacy of all persons involved. According to Archbishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts: \\"the fact that knowledge of these criminal actions is no longer bound by the ‚Äúpontifical secret‚Äù does not mean that it provides the freedom to make it public by those in possession of it, which in addition to being immoral, would undermine the right to a good reputation\\". Moreover, the Instruction does not in any way counter the absolute duty of the Priest to observe the sacramental seal nor the duty of observe the confidentiality of information acquired outside of confession within the whole forum called \\"extra-sacramental\\". The professional secret of those involved in a canonical trial should not constitute an obstacle to ‚Äúthe fulfilment of the obligations laid down in all places by the laws of the State, including any reporting obligations [of possible news of a crime], and the execution of the enforcement requests of the civil courts‚Äù which, naturally, could oblige the delivery of documentary material to the civil courts. In this regard, Prof. Giuseppe Dalla Torre, former president of the Vatican City State Tribunal, observed that: Prof. Dalla Torre underlined that this instruction is a canonical instrument which does not affect the application of the civil laws as they regard the conduction of civil trials and the cooperation with ecclesiastica authorities: According to Archbishop Charles Scicluna, adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the abolition of pontifical secrecy means that:  See also  * vos estis lux mundi * Ecclesiastical response to Catholic sexual abuse cases * Media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases * Grand jury investigation of Catholic Church sexual abuse in Pennsylvania * Theodore McCarrick  References   External links  * Incontro \\"La Protezione dei Minori nella Chiesa\\" (in Italian) on the Vatican website * Pope's introduction at the inauguration of the meeting on the Vatican website Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals Category:Catholicism-related controversies Category:2019 in Vatican City Category:2019 in Italy Category:2019 in Christianity Category:Pope Francis ","title":"Meeting on the Protection of Minors in the Church"},{"id":"60058332","text":"Nothobroscina Roig-Ju√±ent is one five subtribes within the ground beetle tribe Broscini.

History  The Zemskaya Rat was formed on July 23, 1922 by a decree of Mikhail Diterikhs, new ruler of the Provisional Priamurye Government in the Amur region, who became its supreme commander. The new command took measures to restore the control over and raise the morale of the troops, undermined by defeats inflicted by the Red People's Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic in the winter and spring of 1922, and the political crisis in the Amur region in June 1922. In the framework of Diterikhs's policy of restoring the traditional way of life for Russia, the Zemskaya Rat army corps was organized into groups divided into regiments, formed from former brigades. The former regiments were consolidated into battalions and squads. To compensate for the losses incurred by the troops in the Amur region, the mobilization of the young male population was announced. By September 1922, the Zemskaya Rat counted some 6,300 infantry and 1,700 cavalry. The troops were stationed in the larger settlements along the Ussuri Railway. The core of the troops came from the former Far Eastern Army, previously part of the army of General Vladimir Kappel and Ataman Ataman Semyonov.  Operations  The offensive operation against the People's Revolutionary Army troops stationed in Northern Primorye, was launched on September 1, 1922, when the Volga Group began advancing north along the Ussuri railway. However, despite initial successes and the seizure of several railway stations, by September 16, the White Guard troops were forced to withdraw to their original positions and go on the defensive. On October 4, due to the successful offensive of parts of the People's Revolutionary Army, the forces of the Zemskaya Rat were forced to withdraw further. On October 9, they abandoned the Spassk-Dalny fortified area, after which the most combat-ready Volga Group ceased to exist. In the course of the subsequent battles, by October 16, the Zemskaya Rat was completely defeated. General Diterikhs left the region and the remnants of the troops retreated to the border with Korea or were evacuated through the port of Vladivostok, which remained under the control of the Japanese troops until October 25, 1922.

The event took place on February 11, 2019, in Osaka, Osaka, at the Edion Arena Osaka and featured eight matches, two of which were contested for championships. In the main event, Hiroshi Tanahashi defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Jay White. This was the seventeenth event under the New Beginning name and the seventh to take place in Osaka. Storylines The New Beginning in Osaka featured eight professional wrestling matches, which involved different wrestlers from pre- existing scripted feuds and storylines. The final five matches on the card feature Chaos and Main Unit wrestlers taking on Bullet Club wrestlers in singles & tag team matches. Wrestlers portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. At Power Struggle (2017), Jay White made his return to NJPW under his new alias \\"Switchblade\\" and attacked Hiroshi Tanahashi challenging him for his IWGP Intercontinental Championship at Wrestle Kingdom 12, which Tanahashi won. After Wrestle Kingdom, Tanahashi would struggle in the beginning half of 2018 losing his Intercontinental Title to Minoru Suzuki at The New Beginning in Sapporo (2018), losing to Zack Sabre Jr. in the New Japan Cup finals, and losing to Kazuchika Okada in an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match at Wrestling Dontaku 2018 which meant that Okada had broken Tanahashi's record of 11 straight IWGP Heavyweight Title defenses. However, White would triumph in his beginning half of 2018 joining Chaos and beating Kenny Omega at The New Beginning in Sapporo winning the IWGP United States Championship. On Night 3 of the G1 Climax, White would beat Tanahashi (being the only person to do so in the tournament). Tanahashi would end up winning the G1 beating Kota Ibushi in the finals. At Destruction in Kobe, Tanahashi would successfully defend his Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Title challenge rights certificate against Okada. After the match White would attack Tanahashi and Okada, turning on Chaos and aligning himself with Okada's former manager Gedo.

History  Glen Murray was settled by NgƒÅti Tipa. In 1864 the area was described as inaccessible to the British troops in the Invasion of the Waikato, due to the swamps and bush. Glen Murray landing, on Opuatia Stream, to the north of the village However, by 1866 it was in the confiscated area. By 1868 large parcels of land had been surveyed. As part of a policy of opening up land for settlement under the deferred payment scheme, the Government built bridleways from the Waikato River, to give access to two blocks. The northernmost of the 2 routes began at Churchill, a settlement which then stood on the west bank of the river about west of Rangiriri. By 1881, had been opened as far as Glen Murray, through heavy swamp at the Churchill end. By 1883 a through track from the Waikato River to the West Coast was in existence. In 1881 a road was constructed from Churchill west to Glen Murray, and in 1882 a road south from Glen Murray towards Naike was surveyed. In 1893 a post office opened, with a telephone from 1905. Whangape Lake and neighbouring streams were used for transport, a Whangape Launch Company being set up in 1906 to convey goods from Rangiriri. Earlier, in 1894, Parliament had been asked to \\"have obstructions in the shape of eel weirs removed from the navigable creeks flowing from Whangape Lake into the Waikato River, so as to enable steamers now running on the Waikato River to carry goods for settlers in that district.\\" In 1889 the weir had been partly removed to allow a boat to get through.

It was the official newspaper of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. History After the last number in 1700 of the Modona no other newspaper was printed in Modena till Francesco III d'Este, Duke of Modena, requested to Abbot Antonio Bernardi to start publishing the Messaggiere. Bernardi, whose nickname was as Abate Falloppia, used to publish in Venice an handwritten avviso titled Europa and moved to Modena in summer 1749. The first number of the Messaggiere is dated 14 August 1749. It was issued on a weekly basis the Wednesdays and the printers had been Tip. Zuliani Claudio e Antonio and later Soliani Bartolomeo. An article published in the Messaggiere on 27 July 1756 hurted the Prime minister Felice Antonio Bianchi, who obtained from the Duke the dismissal of Bernardi: his last number of the newspaper was published on 25 August 1756. On 1 September 1756 the newspaper was issued by the new publisher Pellegrino Niccol√≤ Loschi. It was always issued on a weekly basis and the printers was Tip. Eredi di Bartolomeo Soliani. The image near the title was a courier riding a horse to a town on the right: on 25 May 1757 the image was reverted, with the town on the left. The newspaper covered the main public events in Modena but the most of the space was dedicated to foreign affairs, in particular to the ones relevant to the Habsburg Empire. To Loschi followed other publishers, all very careful to follow the political line of the Duke: Camillo Tori from 6 June 1759, Mr. Renza from 1761, Giuseppe Maria Cavi from 1770, Giovan Battista Munarini from 1782 to 1796. From 1 July 1767 the design of the first page changed: the only image was the coat of arms of the House of Este, who ruled the Duchy of Modena, without headlines and the title was Il Messaggiere nestled into the coat of arms. From 1 March 1780 it retained only the coat of arms without any title. A number of 1774 The last number of the Messaggiere during the Ancien R√©gime was published on 4 May 1796, three days before the Duke Ercole III d'Este fled to Venice because of the French invasion. During the Napoleonic era the Messaggiere returned to be published two times, from 22 January to 18 June 1800 and from 16 January to 27 December 1805, always edited by the Soliani with the coat of arms of the Este and the usual title. The closures were due in 1800 to the victory of Napoleon in the Battle of Marengo and in 1805 to disagreements with the French government. With the dissolution of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1814, following the Battle of Waterloo, the Duchy of Modena and Reggio was restored, and the newspaper was again published by the Solians starting from 4 January 1815, with the title Il Messaggiere Modenese on a biweekly basis. In 1822 it passed from the Soliani Printing house to the Printing press of the Government. As the official newspaper of Duchy it run till 18 April 1848, when it ceased due to the Revolutions of 1848. The Il Messaggere was published again from 1 September 1848, merging also the experience of other reactionary newspapers published in Modena. The newspaper in these years had had a circulation of about five hundred copies, and was published three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and sometimes also the Saturdays in a half edition. After the Battle of Magenta, on 11 June 1859 Francis V, Duke of Modena fled marking the end of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. The 10 June the Messaggere had been published in the usual form for the last time, on 15 June it retained the old name but substituted the coat of Arms of the House of Austria-Este with the one of the House of Savoy, on 20 June it changed the name into Gazzetta di Modena. The Gazzetta di Modena, which wanted to be the official newspaper of the Government of the town, had a circulation of about two thousand copies. The last number was published on 30 October 1862.

Mount Outram can be seen from the Icefields Parkway southwest of Saskatchewan Crossing, with optimum photography conditions in morning light. History Mount Outram was named in 1920 for James Outram (1864-1925), a mountaineer who made numerous first ascents in the Canadian Rockies including Mount Assiniboine, Chancellor Peak, Cathedral Mountain, and Mount Wilson. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1924 by F.V. Field, W.O. Field, and L. Harris, with guides Edward Feuz Jr. and J. Biner. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Outram is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Outram is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. In terms of favorable weather conditions, summer months are best for climbing.

Personal life Augusta was born in Seneca Falls, New York on October 24, 1844. Her father was Elisha Foote, a judge, inventor, Commissioner of the US Patent Office and mathematician, and her mother was Eunice (n√©e Newton) Foote, a scientist and first female scientist carrying out experiments in her own laboratory. Eunice Newton Foote described and explained the \\"Green House Gas Effect\\" in 1856 or 3 years before Irishman John Tyndall who is widely credited with that research. Mother Eunice Newton Foote was also women's rights campaigner and signatory to the Declaration of Sentiments. Both Mary and Augusta carried on their parents legacy of science. Her older sister was the artist and writer Mary Foote Henderson, who married U.S. Senator John B. Henderson who was the co-author of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which abolished slavery. She was educated at private schools in Saratoga Springs, New York. Career Augusta wrote three books. The first was The Century Cook Book, which was published under the pseudonym Mary Ronald in 1895, and the third was also a cook book published under that pseudonym, Luncheons, A Cook's Picture Book; A Supplement to the Century Cook Book in 1905. Arnold's second book was her only work of scientific writing: The Sea-Beach at Ebb-Tide, A Guide to the Study of the Seaweeds and the Lower Animal Life Found Between Tidemarks, a guide to the flora and invertebrate fauna of the inter-tidal zones of the coasts of the United States, mainly the eastern coast. This book was promoted in the United States' most popular children's magazine of that era, the St. Nicholas Magazine, and it may have had an influence on a generation of American naturalists, including Rachel Carson and Ed Ricketts; the book is cited in the bibliographies of works by these naturalists. John Steinbeck was also known to have been a reader of the magazine. Other American marine biologists, such as Myrtle E. Johnson, Richard Knapp Allen, and Joel Hedgpeth, mention or comment on The Sea Beach at Ebb-Tide. Arnold was a member of the Torrey Botanical Club and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, indicating that she considered herself to be a serious scientist. Eponyms Although the identity of the person honored in the specific name of the Pacific leaping blenny (Alticus arnoldorum), is unclear, Anthony Curtiss who described that species is known to have read The Sea-Beach at Ebb- Tide and gave several other taxa a similar epithet, which is thought to be in commemoration of Arnold. Personal life On March 6, 1869, she was married to Francis Benjamin Arnold in Washington D.C.. Francis was the son of Benjamin Green Arnold (founding president of the Coffee Exchange in the 1880s) and Frances (n√©e Snow) Arnold, and the brother of Charlotte Bruce Arnold. The Arnolds were neighbors of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens in Cornish, New Hampshire, who made a bust of her father-in-law between 1877 and 1880. The couple had three children, two sons and a daughter: * Benjamin Foote Arnold (1870‚Äì1896) * Henry Newton Arnold (1873‚Äì1939), who married Sophia Blum (1885‚Äì1950) and served as Assistant Attorney General under George W.

He conducted widely acclaimed performances of works such as Moses und Aron (Premiere: December 1970, director: Hans-Peter Lehmann), Zimmermann's Die Soldaten (Premiere: June 1974, director: Hans-Peter Lehmann), the double opera Tr√§ume by Isang Yun (Premiere: February 1969, director: /Bild: Peter Heyduck) and Luigi Nono's Intolleranza 70 (Premiere: May 1970). With the Tr√§ume production, Gierster gave guest performances at the Wiener Festwochen, as well as in Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt; with Intollerenza 70 at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. As opera director he engaged numerous acting directors to the Nuremberg opera house, among others Hans Neuenfels (1974 for Il trovatore), Hansg√ºnther Heyme (season 1974/75 for Wozzeck, with Dunja Vejzovic as Marie), Hans Hollmann, , Luca Ronconi, Alfred Kirchner and .  Retirement and death  His last Nuremberg opera premiere as GMD was Elektra in the 1986/87 season (premiere: May 1987). After this, Gierster withdrew from the GMD office for health reasons after he had prematurely terminated his contract in August 1988. He conducted his last concert in February 1989 in the Nuremberg Meistersingerhalle, Mahler's Symphony No. 1 with the Nuremberg Philharmony.

It is an erect shrub with many branches, simple leaves and four-petalled flowers. Description Boronia bella is an erect, many-branched shrub which grows to a height of about with its young branches densely covered with white, star-shaped hairs. The leaves are elliptic, long and wide with a petiole long. Usually only a single flower, but sometimes up to three are arranged on a stalk long. The four sepals are long and wide and the four petals are long and wide but enlarge to long as the fruit develops. The eight stamens are hairy and alternate in length with those opposite the petals shorter than those near a sepal. Flowering occurs from May to September and the fruit are long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia bella was first formally described in 1999 by Marco F. Duretto and the description was published in the journal Austrobaileya.

Early life and education  De Wet was the son of the field cornet Pieter Gerhardus de Wet and his wife, Magdalena Judith Keet, and a cousin of General Christiaan de Wet (Pieter was the brother of Christiaan's father, Jacobus Ignatius de Wet). His education began at a farm school followed by primary school in Carnarvon, after which he studied with A. G. Visser at the Memorial School of the Huguenots in Dal Josafat, where they became close friends. After graduation, he returned to his hometown to farm, though according to one source, he was hired by the Cape Colony government at a young age as a plunge dip inspector of cattle.  Second Boer War  In 1895, he moved to theSouth African Republic, where he and his friend Koos Jooste made a name for themselves as record-setting champion cyclists on the Pretoria-to-Cape-Town race. In September 1899, he and Jooste helped Daniel Theron establish his cyclist scout corps. In December 1899, once he was promoted to a lieutenant, De Wet was ordered by Theron at the head of 25 men to the front at Colesberg and from there to Stormberg, Northern Cape. De Wet and Jooste criticized the government for not stationing troops in Colesberg and advocated an expedition to the northwestern districts of the Cape to foment anti-colonial rebellion and thereby cut off the British connection to the South. Initially refusing his counsel, the SAR government eventually adopted his plan. De Wet accompanied the expedition led by Gen. P. J. Liebenberg and Comm. Lucas Steenkamp, which set out by the end of January 1900. During February and March 1900, De Wet was active in organizing revolts in Prieska, Upington, and Kenhardt, and was promoted to commandant. The surrender of Gen.Piet Cronj√© at Paardeberg on February 27, 1900, and the fall of Bloemfontein on March 13, 1900 obligated Republican forces to retreat quickly south of the Orange River. De Wet then helped defend the Orange Free State from British forces. He joined the Afrikaner Cavalry Corps when Comm. Abraham Malan founded it.  Exile and return  With the dissolution of his unit, De Wet sailed for Europe out of Delagoa Bay. A serious surgery left him out of active service but he often spoke publicly about the war, championing a road through German South West Africa to help Boer representatives in Europe supply Boer troops in South Africa. By July 1901, he was well enough to return to the SAR with the help of its envoy, Willem Johannes Leyds. De Wet continued to function as the intermediary between Boer leadership at home and abroad. After a difficult trip through German South West Africa, he joined the commanders in the Cape in October 1901 and served on the staff of Gen. Jan Smuts, until a serious injury put him out of commission once more. At the end of the war, refusing to submit to British authority, he fled with Gen. Manie Maritz, Com. (later Gen.) Edwin A. Conroy, Com. Jacob Petrus Neser, and High Com. Hendrik Lategan to German South West Africa. From there, they sailed out from Swakopmund on July 30, 1902. Hugging the west coast of Africa, they called port in Victoria, Kamerun (then another German colony, where they boarded another ship traveling via Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Madeira, and Southampton to Hamburg, where he received a hero's welcome on German soil on August 29. The party travelled by train to Berlin where they hoped to meet their heroes, generals Christiaan de Wet, Koos de la Rey, and Louis Botha on the latter's European tour. However, the latter Boer generals would only visit the German capital afterwards, and therefore the company went to the Netherlands where Neser rented them rooms with money borrowed from Cape loyalist Jan du Plessis. While in a hospital, De Wet began and soon completed a book on his wartime experiences. The sources are unclear as to whether this is the same as Die Buren in der Kapkolonie im Kriege mit England (\\"Neighbors in Cape Colony at War with England,\\" published in Munich, which he wrote Van Doomik and Du Plessis. De Wet, who accepted German citizenship, was already beginning to organize massive Boer settlement in German Southwest Africa. He had already negotiated with the German government for land where Boer refugees could live, but was stymied by lack of funds. In 1903, he returned to farm in South West Africa, still unwilling to live under the British flag, and became a leader in the local Afrikaner community.  World War I  German South West Africa in 1904. De Wet started the Freikorps in Windhoek. Korab, where the German troops surrendered to the Union Defense Force, is also indicated on the map. With the outbreak of World War I, De Wet enlisted in the Freikorps on September 9, 1914 in Windhoek, hoping among other things to free his homeland South Africa from British rule. Although the local Freikorps were short-lived, there was no comparable unit in any other German colonies. The all-volunteer corps was recruited from the already large Afrikaner population. The Freikorps's goal was to support the Maritz rebellion that arose after the Union government sided with Great Britain at the outbreak of war in August 1914. The rebels strongly opposed the Union Defense Force (UDF) invasion of German South West Africa and saw British forces' diversion to other fields by the broader war as an opportunity to restore the independence of the Boer republics. The Freikorps operated independently but under the aegis of the German Imperial Forces, the so-called Schutztruppe. The German governor, Theodor Seitz, fully supported the Freikorps' efforts from a strategic point of view, believing the Boers could defeat Botha's government and provide a ready German ally in South Africa. Armed with ammunition, uniforms, materiel, and military support from the German government in Windhoek, the Freikorps joined the rebels in the Northwest Cape in their siege of Upington. De Wet journeyed with the Boer troops from Windhoek to Nakop, serving as captain and commander of the Freikorps regiment sent to join Gen. Maritz there, but soon resigned and was replaced by Cmdt. Stoffel Schoeman. Quickly and poorly trained for numerous battles against the much better equipped UDF, the Freikorps ultimately failed to gain the upper hand in Cape Colony. The members lacked discipline, the rebel leaders often fought among themselves, and contact with the German commanders on the other side of the border was almost completely lost. The last rebel units surrendered to the UDF on February 2 and February 3, 1915, and Seitz officially ordered the unit disbanded on February 15, effective March 1. After the rebellion was suppressed and the slight Freikorps incursion into the Northwest Cape ended, Botha's army had little trouble defeating the Schutztruppe and capturing Windhoek on May 9 without opposition. Only two months later, the German surrender was signed to the north, in Khorab.  In South West Africa  De Wet returned to his farm and soon began participating in local politics. He helped found the United National South West Party and advocated in 1928 for the repatriation of the Dorslandtrekkers from Portuguese soil to South West Africa.  Personal life  His marriage in 1903 in German South West Africa to Elisabeth Hagedom (or Hagdorn) (to whom he had been engaged in Germany a year before his return to Africa) produced four children. After her death, he married Elisabeth Catherina Ackerman, whom he later divorced but with whom he had a son. He was survived by his third wife, Anna Jacoba van Heerden, and was buried in Windhoek. A street southeast of downtown Windhoek was named for him.  Sources  * (af) Nienaber, P. J. 1947. Afrikaanse biografiese woordeboek Deel 1.

The race was to be contested at the Albert Park Circuit and was intended to be the first round of the 2020 Formula One World Championship. The race was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race would have been the 85th race in the combined history of the Australian Grand Prix ‚Äî which dates back to the 100 Miles Road Race of 1928 ‚Äî as well as the 25th time the event had been held at the Albert Park circuit and the 36th time the Australian Grand Prix had been a part of the Formula One World Championship. This was the first Formula One race to be cancelled since the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, which was cancelled due to civil unrest. Lewis Hamilton entered the round as the defending World Drivers' Champion and his team, Mercedes, was the defending World Constructors' Champions. His team-mate Valtteri Bottas was the defending race winner. Background The Australian Grand Prix was officially confirmed as the first of twenty-two races of the 2020 Formula One World Championship at an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris in December 2019. The race was due to take place at the sixteen-turn, Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne, Victoria on 15 March 2020. Entrants Ten teams each with two drivers entered the race. Scuderia AlphaTauri were due to make their debut as a constructor having previously competed under the name Scuderia Toro Rosso. Esteban Ocon was due to return to the championship, replacing Nico H√ºlkenberg at Renault. Nicholas Latifi was scheduled to make his competitive debut with Williams, taking the seat previously filled by Robert Kubica. However, these events were all postponed by the cancellation of the race. Mission Winnow, the title sponsor of Ferrari, was banned from the race as it did not comply with local laws governing tobacco sponsorship.  Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  The weeks before the Grand Prix saw several major sporting events either cancelled or postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a pandemic by World Health Organisation three days before the race. Motorsport events affected included the Chinese Grand Prix, the World Endurance Championship, the MotoGP World Championship, the World Touring Car Cup, the Formula E championship, the World Rally Championship, the Japanese Super Formula championship, and the IndyCar Series. The Victorian Department of Health announced that the Australian Grand Prix would go ahead as planned, but Ferrari and AlphaTauri expressed concern as both teams were based in Italy, which had suffered one of the worst outbreaks of the virus outside China. As the Australian government did not initially implement a travel ban for Italy the way it had for China, Iran and South Korea, Ferrari and AlphaTauri were concerned over the ability of their staff to leave the quarantine zone established in northern Italy. Ross Brawn, the managing director of the sport, announced that Grands Prix would not go ahead if a team were blocked from entering a host nation, but added that a race could take place if a team voluntarily chose not to enter a host nation. Organisers of the Bahrain Grand Prix, which was scheduled to take place one week after the Australian race, announced that spectators would not be permitted to attend the event. Organisers of the Australian Grand Prix opted against similar measures, instead moving to minimise contact between spectators and competitors. The rule was also applied to competitors in support categories, including the Supercars Championship, S5000 Championship and the TCR Asia-Pacific Cup, which was to be held as a non-championship round of the TCR Australia Series. Five crew members, four from Haas and one from McLaren, were entered into quarantine upon arriving in Melbourne when they displayed flu-like symptoms. All five of them were tested for COVID-19 and the results came out negative for the Haas members but positive for the McLaren member. McLaren made the announcement on Thursday evening to withdraw from the race. A photographer later entered isolation as well. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews was criticised for allowing the Grand Prix to go ahead, but responded by saying that cancelling the race would be a disproportionate reaction to the advice the state government had been given. Formula One drivers Lewis Hamilton and Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen were also critical of the decision to hold the race, citing the National Basketball Association's decision to indefinitely suspend its 2019‚Äì20 season. Daniel Andrews announced that spectators would be banned from attending if the Grand Prix were to go ahead, before the race was cancelled on the Friday morning a few hours before the Formula One cars were due to commence their first practice session. It subsequently emerged that only three teams‚ÄîRed Bull Racing, its sister team Scuderia AlphaTauri and Racing Point‚Äîwere willing to compete if the race went ahead. After the cancellation, a further fourteen team members from McLaren were put into quarantine. All support category events were also cancelled. These had conducted practice and qualifying sessions on the Thursday, along with a singular race for the Porsche Carrera Cup Australia series. A two-seater Minardi also performed some demonstration runs early on the Friday morning.2020 Track Schedule Australian Grand PrixAustralian Grand Prix Cancelled SEN 1116 13 March 2020 Attempt to reschedule Shortly after the cancellation, organisers announced that they planned to reschedule the race for later in the year. Several more Grands Prix were cancelled or postponed and the start of the championship delayed until July. A new calendar with eight races was eventually published, but the Australian Grand Prix was not included; however, Liberty Media announced that they intended to hold as many as fifteen races. In June 2020, federal tourism minister Simon Birmingham announced that the Australian government expected that the country's borders would be closed to international travel until 2021.

It is considered an embryonal tumor because it arises from cells partially differentiated or still undifferentiated from birth. Those cells are usually neuroepithelial cells, stem cells destined to turn into glia or neurons. It can occur anywhere within the spinal cord and cerebrum and can have multiple sites of origins, with a high probability of metastasis through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PNET has five subtypes of tumors: neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, medulloepithelioma, ependymoblastoma, and not otherwise specified PNET. It is similar to medulloblastoma regarding histology but different regarding genetic factors and tumor site. It is a rare disease occurring mostly among children, accounting for 1.9 to 7% of childhood brain tumors. Symptoms involve emotional, visual, motor, and speech defects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are used to diagnose PNETs. Even though a universal treatment plan hasn't been stablished yet, common strategies involve chemotherapy and radiotherapy for individuals older than 3 years of age. Their efficacy, however, is still controversial. Surgery can be used to remove mass affected by tumorous cells. The prognosis of the disease is more positive for adults than for children, who have a higher probability of having sequelae from the tumor. It is important to note that this classification term has been removed from the latest WHO classification of CNS tumors as of 2016. Instead PNETs are now included into the category of \\"Embryonal Tumors with Multilayered Rosettes\\" along with ependymoblastoma and embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR). Louis DN, Ohgaki H, Wiestler OD, Cavenee WK \\"WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System. 4th Edition Revised\\"  Classification  Histology of Medulloepithelioma The World Health Organization has classified the central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors into five subtypes: neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, medulloepithelioma, ependymoblastoma, and not otherwise specified PNET. The last one encompasses the PNETs with varying characteristics that hasn't been well defined yet. Neuroblastomas are PNETS that involve the process of cell differentiation into neurons, while ganglioneuroblastomas are PNETs that involve ganglion cells. Medulloepithelioma, on the other hand, are tumors involving the constant cell division on the epithelium tissue where bundle of neuron endings are located. Such tissue will differentiate into a similar form as the embryonic neural tube, also known as the starting structure of the central nervous system. Medulloepitheliomas also present a pattern known as rosettes, characterized by the arrangement of a bundle of cells into circular shapes and around a center or a neuropil. Ependymoblastoma also present rosettes as well as a higher density of cells. It involves the process of differentiation into ependymal cells. Rosettes in Ependymoblastoma histology Further classification types have come up but not yet approved by the World Health Organization. The term \\"embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes\\", or ETANTR, has been proposed as a sixth subtype of PNET. However, the still unofficial term \\"embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes\\" (ETMR) has been more frequently used and encompasses ETANTRs, medulloepitheliomas, ependymoblastomas, and variants of PNETs with presence of rosettes and with no well defined classification.  PNET vs. medulloblastoma  The differentiation between primitive neuroectodermal tumor in the central nervous system and medulloblastoma is recent. According to the World Health Organization, both tumors have the same histology but primitive neuroectodermal tumors occur outside the cerebellum. Moreover, it has been documented that both have different genetic expression and mutations. Another essential difference between them is the location of their respective blood vessels within the brain. It has also been theorized that PNETs influence mainly glia cells while medulloblastomas influence mainly neural behavior, however such theory hasn't been confirmed yet. Medulloblastomas are more frequent than PNETs, representing 10% of all child deaths caused by cancer. They also present better prognosis: children affected by medulloblastoma reach the 5 year survival mark in 70-80% of cases, while children affected by PNET reach the 5 year survival mark in less than 50% of cases.  Risk factors  The rate of PNETs in not correlated with sex, but it shows a correlation with age. Most cases occur in children around 5 years of age, having a very low frequency in adults. Regarding genetic mutations, a specific type of gene alteration that directly leads to this tumor hasn't been defined yet. However, a positive correlation between individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome with a mutation in the gene p53 and PNET has been reported. A significant number of individuals with mutations on the rb tumor suppressor gene have also developed the tumor. Such gene encodes for the protein Rb responsible for stopping the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Another possible contributing factor are mutations in the CREB-binding protein, whose function includes activating transcription, but this interaction still need to be studied further. It has also been presumed that the tumor can arise from cranial irradiation.  Diagnosis  Magnetic resonance image of PNET Most children that develop primitive neuroectodermal tumors are diagnosed early in life, usually at around 3-6.8 years of age. Symptoms patients present at time of diagnosis include irritable mood, visual difficulties, lethargy, and ataxia. The circumference of the patient's head might also suffer an enlargement and they might be subject to seizures, especially if they have less than one year of life. Several analysis can be used to determine the presence of the disease. Physical examinations showing papilledema, visual field defects, cranial nerves palsy, dysphasia, and focal neurological deficits are evidences for possible tumor. PNETs can also be spotted through computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In images produced by MRIs, an irregular augmentation among a solid mass will indicated the presence of tumor. However, the results of MRIs are usually ambiguous in defining the presence for this specific tumor. In CT scans, the presence of PNETs will be indicated by an elevated density and an increase in volume of the brain. The CT scan can also show calcification, which is present in 41-44% of PNET cases. Since the tumor can be replicated in other parts of the nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a CSF analysis can also be conducted. A spinal MRI is a fourth type of analysis that is useful in investigating the level of tumor propagation to the spinal cord.  Treatment  There is not a standardized procedure to treat primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Common strategies involve risk-adapted radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy and stem cell rescue. For patients younger than 2‚Äì3 years of age, treatment with radiation is not used, once they are in a more vulnerable phase and, thus, more prone to risks in development. Examinations such as CSF analysis and spinal MRIs are used to investigate the effectiveness of treatment in preventing metastasis. A method for eliminating tumorous mass is surgery, where the best outcome would be total resection, meaning the complete removal of the tumor. Along with the surgery, several measures that contribute to a safe procedure can be taken: urine exams, transfusion, and the constant supervision of arterial pressure. Possible problems that arise from the surgery include hemorrhage, brain edema, and hemiparesis. MRIs are typically done after 1 or 2 days of postoperative in order to inspect the amount of tumor remaining.  Prognosis  The probability of primitive neuroectodermal tumors to have recurrence and metastasize through cerebrospinal fluid is relatively high. The outcome of PNET is more positive when the individual is an adult, independent of age subgroups, or an older child. Less than 50% of children survive more than 5 years, while the majority of adults live to 7 years. The reason the prognosis for such tumor is worst in children is due to the higher probability of the tumor spreading to the rest of the nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid and growing again. Moreover, children have the probability of developing deficiencies in cognitive processes, problems in the endocrine system, and psychological obstacles after the disease. Adults, on the other hand, don't show such propensity. As a consequence, 37.7% of children affected by the tumor live to 4 years. The effect of treatment strategies such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy on the prognosis of the disease is still controversial, with studies claiming either their benefits or their ineffectiveness. The same holds true for the relationship between volume of tumor removed by surgery and survival. Furthermore, factors such as tumor size, location of origin, race, and sex of individual don't show any influence on the outcome of the disease. However, interactions of some factors such as tumor site, age, and treatment strategy can affect one's prognosis. For instance, when younger children below the age of 3 suffering from tumors originating in places other than the pineal gland are treated with chemotherapy, they present better outcomes than those suffering from pineal tumors and treated with chemotherapy.

Researchers claim that Theosophy has significantly influenced the Irish literary renaissance of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, notably in such figures as W. B. Yeats and G. W. Russell.  Classic writers and Theosophists  A novel The Brothers Karamazov, Vol. II A journal The Theosophist, Bombay  Dostoevsky  In November 1881, Helena Blavatsky, editor in chief of The Theosophist, started publishing her translation into English of \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" from Book V, chapter five of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov. In a small commentary which preceded the beginning of the publication, she explained that \\"the great Russian novelist\\" Dostoevsky died a few months ago, making the \\"celebrated\\" novel The Brothers Karamazov his last work. She described the passage as a \\"satire\\" on modern theology in general and on the Roman Catholic Church in particular. As described by Blavatsky, \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" imagines the Second Coming of Christ occurring in Spain during the time of the Inquisition. Christ is at once arrested as a heretic by the Grand Inquisitor. The legend, or \\"poem\\", is created by the character Ivan Karamazov, a materialist and an atheist, who tells it to his younger brother Alyosha, an immature Christian mystic.\\" According to Brendan French, a researcher in esotericism, \\"it is highly significant\\" that [exactly 8 years after her publication of \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\"] Blavatsky declared Dostoevsky to be \\"a theosophical writer.\\" In her article about the approach of a new era in both society and literature, called \\"The Tidal Wave\\", she wrote: > \\"[The root of evil lies, therefore, in a moral, not in a physical cause.] If > asked what is it then that will help, we answer boldly:‚ÄîTheosophical > literature; hastening to add that under this term, neither books concerning > adepts and phenomena, nor the Theosophical Society publications are meant... > What the European world now needs is a dozen writers such as Dostoyevsky, > the Russian author...

He extracted eight aphorisms of the Indian sage Ramakrishna, eight from The Voice of the Silence by Blavatsky, and one of fellow Theosophist Franz Hartmann, from the issues of 1902 and 1903, and translated them into Russian. Tolstoy had in his library the English edition of The Voice of the Silence, which had been presented to him by its author. In November 1889, Blavatsky published her own English translation of Tolstoy's fairy tale \\"How A Devil's Imp Redeemed His Loaf, or The First Distiller\\", which was accompanied by a small preface about the features of translation from Russian. Calling Tolstoy \\"the greatest novelist and mystic of Russia of to-day,\\" she wrote that all his best works had already been translated, but that the attentive Russian reader would not find the \\"popular national spirit\\" that permeates all original stories and fairy tales, in any of these translations. Despite the fact that they are full of \\"popular mysticism\\", and some of them are \\"charming\\", they are the most difficult to translate into a foreign language. She concluded: \\"No foreign translator, however able, unless born and bred in Russia and acquainted with Russian peasant life, will be able to do them justice, or even to convey to the reader their full meaning, owing to their absolutely national idiomatic language.\\" In September 1890, Blavatsky published philosopher Raphael von Koeber's article \\"Leo Tolstoi and his Unecclesiastical Christianity\\" in her magazine Lucifer. Prof. von Koeber briefly described the merits of Tolstoy as a great master of artistic language, but the main focus of the article was Tolstoy's search for answers to religious and philosophical questions. The author concluded that Tolsto—É's \\"philosophy of life\\" is identical in its foundation to that of Theosophy. Theosophist Charles Johnston, president of the New York branch of the Irish Literary Society, travelled to Russia and met with Tolstoy. In March 1899 Johnston published \\"How Count Tolstoy Writes?\\" in the American magazine The Arena. In November 1904, Rudolf Steiner gave a lecture in Berlin entitled \\"Theosophy and Tolstoy\\", where he discussed the novels War and Peace, Anna Karenina, the novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and the philosophical book On Life (1886‚Äì87).  Yeats  M. Chatterji, 1884 Yeats became interested in Theosophy in 1884, after reading Esoteric Buddhism by Alfred Percy Sinnett. A copy of the book was sent him by his aunt, Isabella Varley. Together with his friends George Russell and Charles Johnston, he established the Dublin Hermetic Society, which would later become the Irish section of the Theosophical Society. According to Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology (EOP), Yeats's tendency toward mysticism was \\"stimulated\\" by the religious philosophy of the Theosophical Society. In 1887, Yeats's family moved to London, where he was introduced to Blavatsky by his friend Johnston. In her external appearance she reminded him of \\"an old Irish peasant woman\\". He recalled her massive figure, constant cigarette smoking, and unceasing work at her writing desk which, he claimed, \\"she did for twelve hours a day.\\" He respected her \\"sense of humor, her dislike of formalism, her abstract idealism, and her intense, passionate nature.\\" At the end of 1887, she officially founded the Blavatsky Lodge of the Theosophical Society in London. Yeats entered into the Esoteric Section of the Lodge in December 1888 and became a member of the \\"Recording Committee for Occult Research\\" in December 1889. In August 1890, to his great regret, he was expelled from the Society for undertaking occult experiments forbidden by the Theosophists. According to The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (EF), Yeats wrote extensively on mysticism and magic. In 1889 he published an article‚Äî\\"Irish Fairies, Ghosts, Witches, etc.\\"‚Äîin Blavatsky's journal, and another in 1914‚Äî\\"Witches and Wizards and Irish Folk-Lore\\". Literary scholar Richard Ellmann wrote of him: > \\"Yeats found in occultism, and in mysticism generally, a point of view which > had the virtue of warring with accepted belief... He wanted to secure proof > that experimental science was limited in its results, in an age when science > made extravagant claims; he wanted evidence that an ideal world existed, in > an age which was fairly complacent about the benefits of actuality; he > wanted to show that the current faith in reason and in logic ignored a far > more important human faculty, the imagination.\\"  Poetry and mysticism  According to Gertrude Marvin Williams, British poet Alfred Tennyson was reading Blavatsky's \\"mystical poem\\" The Voice of the Silence in the last days of his life. In his article on Blavatsky, Prof. Russell Goldfarb mentions a lecture by American psychologist and philosopher William James in which he said that \\"mystical truth spoke best as musical composition rather than as conceptual speech.\\" As evidence for this, James cited this passage from The Voice of the Silence in his book The Varieties of Religious Experience: > \\"He, who would hear the voice of Nada, 'the Soundless Sound,' and comprehend > it, he has to learn the nature of DhƒÅranƒÅ... When to himself his form > appears unreal, as do on waking all the forms he sees in dreams; when he has > ceased to hear the many, he may discern the One‚Äîthe inner sound which kills > the outer...

Thou art Thyself the object of thy search; > the Voice unbroken, that resounds throughout eternities, exempt from change, > from sin exempt, the seven sounds in one, the Voice Of The Silence. Om tat > Sat.\\" In Buddhist writer Dennis Lingwood's opinion, the author of The Voice of the Silence (abbreviated VS) \\"seeks more to inspire than to instruct, appeals to the heart rather than to the head.\\" A researcher of NRM Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that, in spite of inevitable questions on the origins and authorship of VS, the \\"authenticity of the tone of the teachings and the expression of the sentiments\\" have risen above the Theosophical and occult environment, receiving \\"independent respect\\" from such authorities as William James, D. T. Suzuki and others. Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky affirmed that VS has a \\"very special\\" position in modern mystical literature, and used several quotes from it in his book Tertium Organum to demonstrate \\"the wisdom of the East.\\" Writer Howard Murphet has called VS a \\"little gem\\", noting that its poetry \\"is rich in both imagery and mantra-like vibrations.\\" Annie Besant characterized the language of VS as \\"perfect and beautiful English, flowing and musical.\\" In Prof. Robert Ellwood's opinion, the book is a \\"short mystical devotional work of rare beauty.\\" Other scholars of religious studies have suggested that: a rhythmic modulation in VS supports \\"the feeling of mystical devotion\\"; the questions illumined in VS are \\"explicitly devoted to the attainment of mystical states of consciousness\\"; and that VS is among the \\"most spiritually practical works produced by Blavatsky.\\" William James said of mysticism that: \\"There is a verge of the mind which these things haunt; and whispers therefrom mingle with the operations of our understanding, even as the waters of the infinite ocean send their waves to break among the pebbles that lie upon our shores.\\"  Theosophical fiction   Forerunner  Edward Bulwer-Lytton The Dweller on the Threshold, painted by R. Machell (1854‚Äì1927) According to scholar Brendan French, novels by authors in the Rosicrucian tradition are a path to the \\"conceptual domain\\" of Blavatsky. He notes that Zanoni (1842) by Edward Bulwer-Lytton is \\"undoubtedly the apogee of the genre\\". It was this novel that later had the greatest impact on the elaboration of the concept of the Theosophical mahatmas. French quoted Blavatsky as saying: \\"No author in the world of literature ever gave a more truthful or more poetical description of these beings than Sir E. Bulwer-Lytton, the author of Zanoni.\\" This novel is especially important for followers of occultism because of \\"the suspicion‚Äîactively fostered by its author‚Äîthat the work is not a fictional account of a mythical fraternity, but an accurate depiction of a real brotherhood of immortals.\\" According to EF, Bulwer-Lytton's character the \\"Dweller on the Threshold\\" has since become widely used by followers of Theosophy and authors of \\"weird fiction\\". A second important novel for Theosophists by Bulwer-Lytton is The Coming Race published in 1871.  Theosophists as fiction writers  According to French, Theosophy has contributed much to the expansion of occultism in fiction. Not only were Theosophists writing occult fiction, but many professional authors who were prone to mysticism joined the Theosophical Society. Russian literary scholar Anatoly Britikov wrote that \\"Theosophical myth is beautiful and poetic\\" because its authors had an \\"extraordinary talent for fiction\\", and borrowed their ideas from works of \\"high literary value.\\" In John Clute's opinion, Blavatsky's own fiction, most of which was published in 1892 in the collection Nightmare Tales, is \\"unimportant\\". However, her main philosophical works, Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine, can be considered as rich sources that contain \\"much raw material for creators of fantasy worlds\\". He wrote that in its content, supported by an attendant entourage that intensifies its effect, Theosophy is a \\"sacred drama, a romance, a secret history\\" of the world. Those whose souls are \\"sufficiently evolved to understand that drama know the tale is enacted in another place, beyond the threshold... within a land exempt from secular accident.\\" In Prof. Antoine Faivre's opinion, Ghost Land, or Researches into the Mysteries of Occultism by Emma Hardinge Britten, one of the founders of the Theosophical movement, is \\"one of the principal works of fiction inspired by the occultist current\\". Mabel Collins, who helped Blavatsky edit the Theosophical journal Lucifer in London, wrote a book entitled The Blossom and the Fruit: A True Story of a Black Magician (1889). According to EOP the book demonstrated her growing interest in metaphysics and occultism. After leaving editorial work, however, she published several books that parodied Blavatsky and her Masters. Franz Hartmann has published several fiction works: An Adventure among the Rosicrucians (1887), the Theosophical satire The Talking Image of Urur (1890), and Among the Gnomes (1895)‚Äîa satire on those who immediately deny everything \\"supernatural\\". Russian philologist Alexander Senkevich noted that Blavatsky perfectly understood that the titular 'Talking Image' was her \\"caricatured persona\\", but nevertheless continued publishing the novel in her magazine for many months. In the foreword to the first edition its author proclaimed that the characters of the novel are \\"so to say, composite photographs of living people\\", and that it was created \\"with the sole object of showing to what absurdities a merely intellectual research after spiritual truths will lead.\\" \\"The end of Hartmann's novel is unexpected. The evil forces that held the 'Talking Image' weaken, and it is freed from the darkening of consciousness. The author's final conclusion is quite a Buddhist one: 'Search for the truth yourself: do not entrust this to someone else'.\\" The Theosophical leaders William Quan Judge, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Anna Kingsford, and others wrote so-called \\"weird stories\\". In his fiction collection, Leadbeater gave a brief description of Blavatsky as a storyteller of occult tales: \\"She held her audience spell-bound, she played on them as on an instrument and made their hair rise at pleasure, and I have often noticed how careful they were to go about in couples after one of her stories, and to avoid being alone even for a moment!\\" The novel Karma by Alfred Sinnett is, in essence, a presentation of the Theosophical doctrines of karma and reincarnation, using knowledge of past lives and the present karma of the leading characters. His next occult novel United, was published in 1886 in 2 volumes. A trilogy The Initiate (1920‚Äì32) by Cyril Scott was extremely popular and reprinted several times. In it the author expounds his understanding of the Theosophical doctrine, using fictional characters alongside real ones.  Fiction writers and Theosophy  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, ca. 1887 In 1887, Blavatsky published the article \\"The Signs of the Times\\", in which she discussed the growing influence of Theosophy in literature. She listed some novels that can be categorized as Theosophical and mystical literature, including Mr Isaacs (1882) and Zoroaster (1885) by Francis Marion Crawford; The Romance of Two Worlds (1886) by Marie Corelli; The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) by Robert Louis Stevenson; A Fallen Idol (1886) by F. Anstey; King Solomon's Mines (1885) and She: A History of Adventure (1887) by H. Rider Haggard; Affinities (1885) and The Brother of the Shadow (1886) by Rosa Campbell Praed; A House of Tears (1886) by Edmund Downey; and A Daughter of the Tropics (1887) by Florence Marryat. According to EOP, the prototype for the main character of Crawford's novel Mr Isaacs was someone called Mr. Jacob, a Hindu mage of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Blavatsky was particularly charmed by Crawford's Ram Lal, a character akin to Bulwer- Lytton's Mejnour or Koot Hoomi of the Theosophists. Ram Lal says of himself: \\"I am not omnipotent. I have very little more power than you. Given certain conditions I can produce certain results, palpable, visible, and appreciable by all; but my power, as you know, is itself merely the knowledge of the laws of nature, which Western scientists, in their ignorance, ignore.\\" According to EF, this book informs readers about some of the teachings of Theosophy. Rosa Campbell Praed was interested in spiritualism, occultism, and Theosophy, and made the acquaintance of many Theosophists who, as French pointed out, \\"inevitably became characters in her novels\\". He wrote: \\"Praed was especially influenced by her meeting in 1885 with Mohini Chatterji (who became the model for Ananda in The Brother of the Shadow).\\" French wrote that figures of the Theosophical mahatmas appear in several of the most popular novels of Marie Corelli, including her first book The Romance of Two Worlds (1886). A similar theme is present in A Fallen Idol (1886) by F. Anstey. According to EOP, the author of occult novels Algernon Blackwood specialized in literature describing psychic phenomena and ghosts. In their article \\"Theosophy and Popular Fiction\\", the esotericism researchers Gilhus and Mikaelsson point out that in his novel The Human Chord (1910), Blackwood warns readers about the dangers of occult experiments. Gustav Meyrink's novel The Golem (1914) is mentioned by many researchers of esotericism. Writer Talbot Mundy created his works on the basis of the Theosophical assumption that various forms of occultism exist as evidence of the ancient wisdom that is preserved at the present time, thanks to the secret brotherhood of adepts.

The band is under contract with Cruz del Sur Music/V√°n Records and has so far released three studio albums. History Early years (2005 to 2010) The band was founded in 2005 by Manuel Trummer (guitar) and Florian Kreuzer (bass). The further members Markus Becker (vocals), Michael Koch (guitar) and Mario White (drums) joined two years later. In 2007, they released the demo The Pnakotic Demos, followed by the EPs A Prophet in the Forest and The Pnakotic Vinyls two years later. The band has performed at renowned underground festivals, including the 2009 , the , the Up the Hammers in Athens, the Dublin Doom Day and the Doom Metal Inquisition in Bradford. The Golden Bough and The White Goddess (since 2010) Atlantean Kodex signed to the Italian label Cruz del Sur Music. In 2010, the debut album The Golden Bough was released. The title comes from the book The Golden Bough of the Scottish anthropologist James George Frazer, who believed that all European religions evolved from the magical thinking of the Stone Age people. He considered magic to be the root of religions. The album became album of the month in the magazine Rock Hard, as well as in the Heavy oder was? Magazine and in the Greek Metal Hammer. In the annual polls of the online communities of Sacred Metal and Rock Hard, The Golden Bough won in the category \\"Album of the Year\\". In 2011, Atlantean Kodex played at the Rock Hard Festival, in 2012 they were confirmed for the Bang Your Head!!! festival, but had to cancel their performance; however, in 2014 they played the festival. The second album The White Goddess was published on 4 October 2013 and received excellent reviews again in the press.Boris Kaiser: Atlantean Kodex - The White Goddess. In: Rock Hard, October 2013, p. 113 The album entered the German charts at #65.https://www.offiziellecharts.de/album- details-228221 Style Atlantean Kodex was founded by Manuel Trummer to create an alternative to modern metal. Key influences were old Manowar and Bathory. The band plays epic, based on the Doom Heavy Metal, which was described as a mixture of Candlemass and Solitude Aeturnus with Manowar, Iced Earth, Bathory or Solstice. Another influence is the hard rock of the 1970s, like Uriah Heep or Rainbow. For the lyrics Trummer was inspired by ancient European mythology, writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard or Carl Amery as well as Bavarian culture. The musicians are considered to be advocates of analogue recording techniques and have spoken out repeatedly in interviews accordingly.

It may be related to the autonomous sensory meridian response, a pleasing, tingling sensation. Evan Malone, a professor of art and film philosophy, theorized that the appeal of oddly satisfying videos may lie in their portrayal of everyday experiences as cinematic and, in Baudrillard's words, \\"hyper-real\\".

It encourages humanists and atheists to meet up, socialise, share information and support other atheists as they \\"come out\\" to friends and family, particularly (but not limited to) people in ethnic minorities and people of the African diaspora. Formation Association of Black Humanists was formed (as London Black Atheists) in November 2012 by Clive Aruede, a former Catholic Church eucharistic minister, Lola Tinubu, who had grown up an evangelical Christian and two other friends. They formed the group as both had found it difficult and felt socially isolated without the acceptance of the religious communities they had grown up in. Aruede has also made the observation that while the group is not separatist, in his experience black people are more likely to \\"come out\\" within a group with other black people than a predominantly white group. Aruede became an atheist after confronting challenging questions from his 12-year-old daughter and researching cosmology, genetics and evolution. Tinubu left her religion following a visit from her Nigerian father that made her confront the cognitive dissonance she saw between his faith and his scientific understanding. Both felt there was a need for an atheist advocacy and support group for people from minorities and in particular those from conservative religious societies in which religion can define one's way of life. Tinubu found that many people in Africa and the African diaspora equate rejecting religion with rejecting ones cultural heritage and traditions. Association of Black Humanists uses the language of LGBT self-disclosure such as \\"coming out\\" when publicly stating one has left a religion and supports individuals' anonymity who do not wish their atheism to be revealed publicly. Work and meetings Association of Black Humanists uses online platforms such as Facebook and Meetup to organise talks, meetings, social functions, marches and fundraisers. It is also affiliated with Humanists UK and the Central London Humanists group. The group does not focus on speaking out against a particular religion, but discussion typically centres around Christianity, as Aruede explains this is the religion most blacks from the Caribbean and continent of Africa have been brought up in. Association of Black Humanists has hosted prominent speakers such as Leo Igwe (Breaking the Taboo of Atheism in Black Communities'), Gus Casely-Hayford and Maryam Namazie, who is also a patron of the organisation. They have also presented at secular conferences such as the Humanists UK conference 2017, the 2017 International Conference on Free Expression and Conscience, and the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain annual conference 2015.

It represents a continuation of the Landquart‚ÄìDavos Platz railway. The line is consistently single-track, apart from the stations, and has been electrified since 1919.  Route description Landwasser-Bruecke just south of Davos Platz ABe 8-12, Davos Clavadelerstrasse The line starts at Davos Platz station and runs first through the southern part of the Davos countryside. The line crosses the Landwasser for the first time on a bridge outside Davos Platz. A short time later it passes the siding to the waste disposal facility and a little later the former halt of Islen, before the line runs to the south on a long straight section next to the river. A siding branches off to the gravel works before Frauenkirch station and then the line changes to the western side of the river on another bridge. B√§rentritt bridge in the Z√ºgenschlucht. An Allegra crosses the Br√ºggentobelbach The line crosses the Landwasser again on another bridge near Glaris and crosses Landwasserstrasse shortly later. After Glaris station, the valley becomes increasingly narrow and the line reaches the wild Z√ºgenschlucht (gorge) shortly after Davos Monstein and passed through it using various tunnels and bridges. Wiesen Viaduct ETH-BIB (1946) The Wiesen station is far below the village it is named after. Immediately after the station, the line runs over the long and high Wiesen Viaduct, which is Rhaetian Railway's largest stone bridge. The line then traverses the remaining section to the Filisur station, far above the deep Landwasser gorge on a slope. A total of 14 tunnels with a total length of 4,200 metres and 28 bridges are passed between Davos Platz and Filisur, which makes the line technically extremely interesting, not least because of the famous Wiesen Viaduct. Immediately south of the Wiesen Viaduct there is also a Hipp turning disk (Wendescheibe) at the edge of the track, which, however, is no longer used as a railway signal for rail operations. A parliamentary initiative launched in 2008 to connect this line with the Arosa Railway is currently not considered a priority by the Grisons government in the light of tight financial resources.  Station buildings Davos Glaris station A push-pull train on the way to Filisur passes the Hipp turning disc at the Wiesen Viaduct in 2008 The style of the station building is largely uniform. These are in each case two-storey, dark brown wooden buildings with goods sheds integrated on the north side, where the roof ridge running parallel to the tracks usually protrudes slightly beyond the gable at the ends of the building. Also characteristic is the balcony, often decorated with flower boxes, above the service rooms on the short side of the building under the extended roof. The goods ramp located on the other side is also protected from the weather by a laterally extended roof in the area of the freight shed. The windows upstairs are framed by green shutters. Somewhat different from this unitary design is the station building of Davos Monstein that has no attached goods shed and is therefore significantly smaller, almost rectangular. In addition, the gable here faces the tracks, so it is rotated by 90 degrees compared to the line's other entrance buildings. Nevertheless, it also has a dark wood colour in combination with the characteristic green shutters. The station buildings of Frauenkirch, Monstein and Wiesen are located to the west of the tracks, but the Glaris station building is to the east. All of the intermediate stations are no longer occupied by train staff, but the waiting rooms on the ground floor are still accessible to passengers during the day. There is a much simpler shelter with a flat roof, which is not used elsewhere, at the halt of Davos Islen, which is no longer served.  Rail operations A Regio service leaves Wiesen station towards Filisur with the locomotive in front The route is mainly served by Regio trains at regular intervals. An hourly rate is offered between 6:05 am and 9:30 pm with the Regios taking around 25 minutes each way. The use of railcars or push‚Äìpull trains, which eliminates the need to run the locomotive around at the terminus and, due to a short turnaround in Filisur, does not usually result in Regio trains crossing at the intermediate stations of the line. Locomotives Ge 4/4 iii 641 to 652 and trainsets of class Abe 8/12 3501 to 3515 are used. In addition to this, the RhB also offers seasonal through trains that run from Davos via Filisur, the Albula line and the Bernina Railway to Tirano in Italy. The 2019 timetable includes a Bernina Express to Tirano in the morning and from Tirano in the afternoon, which are scheduled to cross Regio services in Davos Wiesen at 10:09 am and in Davos Glaris at 6:39 pm. In addition, there is occasional freight traffic on the line. Along the line there are freight sidings for waste disposal in Davos Islen and for connecting to the gravel work and the arsenal in Davos Frauenkirch.

There were no fatalities among the 14 passengers on board, but the cockpit section was severely damaged, and the captain died of his injuries four days later.  Accident  An ATR 42 of Air Littoral similar to the aircraft involved. At around 10:30 on the day of the accident, following an uneventful flight from Nice, the aircraft prepared to land at Florence's Peretola airport, where the weather was reported as CAVOK, that is good visibility and no cloud; the wind was light and variable. The crew elected to land on runway 23, which has a 620-metre displaced threshold. Such choice was described as unusual, in the given conditions; eighty percent of the aircraft operating on the airport that day had landed on the opposite runway, runway 05. At 10:36 the aircraft was observed touching down far into the runway and at a much higher speed than usual. It then overran the runway end, crashed through the airport perimeter fence and into a ditch next to the nearby A11 motorway. The right engine stopped when the propeller contacted the ground, but the left engine kept running for the following 45 minutes, while rescue operations were taking place. All passengers were rapidly evacuated, but due to the damage to the cockpit section, it took about an hour to extricate the two crew members. The captain was hospitalised but succumbed to his injures four days later; the first officer and 13 other passengers were injured.  Aircraft  The aircraft was an ATR 42-500 twin turboprop, with French registration F-GPYE, powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127 engines. Air Littoral, the launch customer for the model, took delivery of the aircraft the year before, in 1996.  Investigation and trial  At the time, the Italian air accident investigation agency, the Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo, had not been established yet, therefore the matter was referred to the Italian Civil Aviation Authority and to the public prosecutor. It emerged that during the landing, the first officer was the pilot flying, and was undergoing line training under the captain's supervision. The prosecutor determined that the final approach was conducted at an excessive speed and rate of descent, even triggering the associated on-board warning system, which was ignored. No technical defects were found in the aircraft. The first officer and two managers from Air Littoral ‚Äì the head of training and the head of human resources ‚Äì were charged with manslaughter and causing an air disaster, but were acquitted in November 2003. The responsibility for the crash was ultimately placed on the captain, and his \\"imprudent\\" decision to proceed with the landing despite the unsafe approach. Legacy The accident highlighted the limitations of Florence's Peretola airport, which is geographically constrained between the A11 motorway and Mount Morello. The event was cited during the following years as argument against proposals to further develop the airport, with opponents recommending to expand nearby Pisa Airport instead.

Adlerberg was a military man, politician, celebrity and Orthodox. This book is divided into two volumes, both depicting Adlerberg's family religious pilgrimage to Constantinople. He claims that the aim of his volumes is to describe his pious memories and more specifically those of Holy places and Jesus Christ. The first edition of both volumes was published in French 1867 by the Imprimerie Centrale du minist√®re des finances in St-Petersburg. The original edition of the first volume counts 532 pages and the second volume, 520.  Context  Nikolai Vladimirovich Adlerberg Adlerberg's En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences was a depiction of his religious pilgrimage to the Holy places fought for during the Crimean war (1853-1856). At the time of his writing En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences, the Crimean War (1853-1856) had just ended. This war mainly opposed Russia to the Ottoman Empire allied with Britain and France. It began due to the crumbling of the Ottoman Empire, the feud between Orthodoxy (supported by the Russians) and Christianity (represented by the French) for Holy places and Russia's colonial endeavors, notably.Badem, C. (2010). THE ORIGINS OF THE WAR. In The Ottoman Crimean War (1853-1856) (pp. 46-54). Brill. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w8h1kf.9 The outcome of the war was the defeat of Russia. The conflict for the control of the Holy places began before the Crimean War, it started in the 18th century. One aspect of this quarrel was the fight to take control of the Golden Gate in Jerusalem. Russia stood as a defender of the Orthodox subjects in Palestine and advocated for their being given control of the Holy places. However, the Russian claims were not fulfilled. To resolve the issue, the Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I gave the key to the Golden Gate, praying rights and ownership of the Holy sites to the Christians in 1852. Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I guaranteed the Orthodoxes that their rights would remain unchanged, but Russia strongly protested this act. This conflict continued during the Crimean War, during which Russia's interest lied in taking control of the Holy places to support the importance of the Orthodox community in the Ottoman Empire. More specifically, Tsar Nicholas I aimed at re-establishing the Orthodox Christian religion in Constantinople. He also wished to take over various significant sites from the early Christianity in Jerusalem and its vicinity, such as the Church of the Nativity. In addition to the Crimean War, another contextual feature surrounding En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences was the Caucasian wars (1817‚Äì1864). As a military man, Adlerberg fought in the wars of Caucasus. The Caucasus was situated between the Black and Caspian Seas. The totality of the South Caucasus and part of the North were annexed by Russia as a result of the Russo-Persian wars of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828 that opposed Iran to Russia.Dowling, T. C. (2015).

Moreover, in 2018, (the second volume of) En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences was chosen by scholars as being culturally important and was edited by Wentworth Press.En Orient: Impressions Et R√©miniscences Broch√© ‚Äì 23 juillet 2018 An English version of the book was also published in 2008 by BiblioLife.  Content  Both volumes of En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences are travel books that take the form of journals. There are no pictures or illustrations in any of these volumes.  En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences (vol.1)  The first volume counts 532 pages and is divided into 26 chapters. Adlerberg depicts the impressions and descriptions of his travels through Egypt and Palestine. Adlerberg has also argued that these depictions were not exaggerated. In the preface, Adlerberg also claims that he does not wish to impose his religious view on his readers. This journal is written in the first person and using the pronoun \\"we\\", referring to Adlerberg and his family. However, at times, he also uses the second person. In the latter case, Adlerberg considers the reader as a prospective traveler in the regions he visits. He also describes his own experiences as if it was the reader's. This volume can be divided into three main parts, his description of the beginning of his trip, before his arrival in Egypt, his stay and travels in the latter and in Palestine. In En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences, three chapters are dedicated to the descriptions of his travels from one main destination to the other. The chapters are called \\"Dans l'adriatique\\", \\"Dans la m√©dit√©ran√©e\\" and \\"En mer, Pour La Palestine\\". In this \\"Dans l'adriatique\\", Adlerberg writes that he began his trip to Palestine as a result of a need for new impressions and more serious ideas. He claims that he wished to go on a far away trip, different, and more adventurous than the usual pilgrimages from European tourists. He then goes on to describe how Jerusalem and Palestine are places related to the Bible and Jesus. \\"Dans la m√©dit√©ran√©e\\", Adlerberg's trip momentarily stops in the Corfu Island, which he then goes on to describe. He talks about the churches, nature, and the weather. In \\"En mer, Pour La Palestine\\", Adlerberg talks about his boat trip to Jaffa. In this chapter, he describes the commander and the other travelers accompanying him and his family.  Egypt  During his stay in Egypt, Adlerberg visits Alexandria and Cairo. In these cities, he claims himself to be a tourist. He describes his stay in various hotels and the food they are served. Adlerberg and his family also take part in touristic attraction such as visiting the pyramids of Gizeh or various markets within Cairo and Alexandria. During these activities, Adlerberg describes the various individuals he encounters, translating some native vocabulary words for the reader. During his stay in Egypt and as he was a celebrity and close to Tsar Nicholas I, Adlerberg and his family met various important figures. Two of these personalities were the Consul of Egypt and the vice-pacha, Sa√Ød-Pacha. Adlerberg also describes more into detail the culture of Egypt, highlighting its backwardness.  Palestine  In the chapters dedicated to Palestine and especially Jerusalem, Adlerberg focuses on religion and his faith as he is a fervent Orthodox. He draws multiple parallels between the places he sees/visits/passes by and what happens in the Bible. He also describes his visit of Churches where his faith really transcribes. For instance, sometimes, he claims he hears the voice of God or falls on his knees, overwhelmed by the religious presence surrounding him.  Reception  En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences' publication may give information regarding its reception. In the same year of its original publication, a Russian version of the books was published in Russian. French, the original language of the book, was spoken among the Russian aristocracy. It was made available to the larger public by being translated in Russian in the same year. Moreover, a second edition of En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences was published two years after its original publication. This version of the book is identical to the original publication. En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences was not banned but re-printed illustrates that it was not opposed by Tsar Nicholas I or most of the Russian population in general. Furthermore, the second volume of En Orient: impressions et r√©miniscences was later chosen by scholars as culturally important.

In an attempt to boost their fortunes, Agunam secured the signings of two former Welgris Highlanders players Marshall Lori and Japheth Olow, as well as Lae City Dwellers' midfielder Michael Saun ahead of the second half of the season. However, the side continued to struggle, losing all ten of their matches, with their fate sealed on the final day after a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Morobe FC. Ahead of the 2019 season, Agunam claimed she believed that the region had enough talent to justify a return to the NSL. However, the major hurdle standing in their way was funding. Upon the launch of the new season, Goroka Gosiha were not one of the clubs registered to take part.

Career In the late 1960s, Barclay joined the collective of session musicians known as the Musicians Contact Service in Los Angeles. In January 1970, she was asked to join the all-female rock group Fanny as a singer and keyboardist. She was one of the main songwriters and lead singers in the group, and appeared on all their albums, adding soul, blues and funk influences to the group's overall sound. After managing to join Joe Cocker for a few months on his March 1970 US tour as a backing vocalist, during which she was recorded for the live album Mad Dogs and Englishmen, Barclay returned to Fanny. She played on Barbra Streisand's 1971 album, Stoney End and along with the other members of Fanny, performed on the follow-up Barbra Joan Streisand. Barclay left Fanny at the end of 1974, shortly before the band split up. Her song \\"Solid Gold\\", first appearing on Fanny's 1973 album Mother's Pride, was re-recorded by Keith Moon for his 1975 solo album, Two Sides of the Moon; Barclay also played keyboards on the album.

The rebellion took place mainly in the area of Western Macedonia and it peaked with the capture of Mariovo and its proclamation as \\"Free Greece\\".  Background  In 1866 the Great Cretan Revolution broke out. Simultaneously there appear other revolutionary bases throughout the Greek-inhabited Ottoman Empire, like Thessaly, Epirus. At the end of April 1866, Leonidas Voulgaris disembarked on Ormylia in Chalchidiki, at the head of an armed force, and united with the local fighters under captain Georgios from the Mademochoria. The activities of this force ended on June of the same year because of the quick response of the powerful Ottoman forces garrisoned in the area, after the Greek government itself notified the Ottoman authorities to avoid a diplomatic incident.E. Kofos, Dim. Tsafaras, History of Macedonia from prehistoric times up to 1912, Society for Macedonian Studies, Macedonian Library, n. 63, Thessaloniki 1983 In Western Macedonia and specifically in Monastir, which was the center of Greek culture in the area, operated a nationalist association called \\"Kazino\\", since 1852. Revolutionary brewings started in 1866 because of the Cretan Revolution and various armed groups, under Greek Macedonian leaders, entered Macedonia from Greece in this period. In 1867 the \\"New Filiki Etaireia\\" was founded in Monastir by Greek Macedonians, such as the educator Anastasios Pichion from Ohrid, the gymnasium headmaster Nikolaos Filippidis from Monastir, the doctor Ioannis Argyropoulos from Kleisoura, Kastoria. They were joined by many others such as the Nymfaians Michael and Anastasios Tsirlis, as well as Ioannis Boutaris (great- great-grandfather of the mayor of Thessaloniki Yiannis Boutaris). The organisation aimed at the morally elevating Macedonian Hellenism and conducting revolutionary operations.  Revolt  During the Cretan Revolt, the appropriate distraction was found and a coordinated revolt commenced, armed bands of Macedonian klephts who had trained on guerilla warfare for some time, in the Macedonian mountains. The most important were, Naoum Kyrou from Antartiko, A. Kordistas from Nymfaio, Nikolaos Pinis (also known as Kole Pinas) from Flampouro, brothers Nikolaos and Stefanos Dalipis from Sfika, Naoum Konstantinidis (Orlinis) from Ieropigi, Kastoria and his lieutenant Naidos, Arkoudas, Giaresis and others. After continuous battles with Ottoman forces in the area, they managed to take control of the area of Mariovo, which they declared \\"Free Greece\\". The general revolt ended in fall of 1867, when the rebels withdrew because of winter, but also because of pressure from the Ottoman army. For the next two years the situation was unstable, as armed Macedonians frequently clashed with Ottoman forces. Though these actions were uncoordinated and soon the revolution ended completely.  Aftermath  The outcome of the revolt was predetermined, as the rebels were isolated in Western Macedonia, surrounded by significant numbers of Ottoman troops. Already since the summer of 1867 the revolutionary cells in Thessaly and EpirusŒ®œÖœáŒøŒ≥ŒπœåœÇ, Œ§Œø ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫œå œÄŒªŒ±ŒØœÉŒπŒø œÑŒøœÖ ŒôŒúŒëŒ°ŒïŒ§, ŒìŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒöŒ±ŒªœÄŒøœçŒ∂ŒøœÇ had been suppressed and there was no prospect of aid from the Greek state. Greece offered no help, and soon the revolt was crushed. What it managed to do however was to rouse Macedonian Hellenism and create a new lot of rebels, who had to become klephts in the mountains, in order to survive. Therefore, a significant reserve of fighters was created who would come to be useful in the future.

The primate of the PESEA is Metropolitan Sergius (Chashin) who holds the title of \\"Metropolitan of Singapore and South-East Asia\\".  History   Background  Eastern Orthodoxy initially developed in Korea in connection with the activities of the Korean spiritual mission of the Russian Orthodox Church in the early 20th century. After the revolution of 1917, in conditions of turmoil and unprecedented dispersion of the flock of the Russian Orthodox Church in different countries of the world, the first Russian parishes appeared in Southeast Asia: in the Philippines and in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), which at that time were subordinate to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Missionary activity at that time was not carried out, so the departure of Russian refugees from Southeast Asia led to the disappearance of these parishes. Russian spiritual mission in South Korea in 1955 was transferred to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, immigrants from the former Soviet Union and other traditionally Orthodox countries began to arrive in Southeast Asia. However, there were practically no Eastern Orthodox parishes on this area, and the Moscow Patriarchate did not have it at all. Gradually the situation began to change. In 1999, hegumen Oleg (Cherepanin) founded the St. Nicholas parish in Bangkok. In 2001, hegumen Oleg was appointed head of the then established Representation of The Russian Orthodox Church in the Kingdom of Thailand, which was also responsible for Laos and Cambodia. After the registration of the Russian Orthodox Church in Thailand in 2008, it became possible to open parishes across the country. As of 2018, there were 10, and all of them had permanent churches built. In addition, a theological college was built and opened on the island of Phuket to train people of South-East Asia who converted to Orthodoxy. Three parishes in Cambodia were established, with churches were built for two of them. Since 2014, the Russian Otrhodox mission in the Philippines began to develop, where the mass conversion of former Aglipayans to Orthodoxy began; in 2018, there were 16 parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in the Philippines, mainly on the island of Mindanao. Two Russian Orthodox communities were created in Vietnam, one in V≈©ng T√†u (since 2002) and the other in Hanoi (since 2016). In Indonesia, the parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate were opened in Jakarta, Surabaya and Bali. The Russian Orthodox Church sent priests to these parishes. On October 21, 2016, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church appointed Bishop Sergius (Chashin) of Solnechnogorsk as the administrator for the parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Southeast and East Asia. He took care of parishes in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, the DPRK, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam. A separate structure was formed for Thailand: the Patriarchal Parishes in Thailand, subordinated directly to the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'.  Creation of the PESEA  On 28 December 2018, in response to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's actions in Ukraine, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church decided to create \\"a Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe with the center in Paris\\", as well as \\"a Patriarchal Exarchate in South-East Asia [PESEA] with the center in Singapore.\\" The \\"sphere of pastoral responsibility\\" of the PESEA is Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, North Korea, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, the Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand. On the same day, in an interview with Russia-24 channel, Metropolitan Hilarion, spokesman of the ROC, declared the ROC \\"will now act as if they [Constantinople] do not exist at all because our purpose is missionary, our task is to educate, we are creating these structures for ministerial care about our flock, there can be no such deterring factors here\\", and that the ROC will take charge of the Orthodox faithfuls of its diaspora instead of the Eumenical Patriarchate. Archbishop Sergius (Chashin), was appointed as primate of the newly created PESEA, with the title \\"of Singapore and Southeast Asia\\". On 7 January 2019, during the evening service in the Church of Christ the Savior in Moscow, Patriarch Kirill elevated Archbishop Sergius (Chashin) to the rank of Metropolitan in connection with the latter's appointment as exarch of the PESEA. In August 2019, Metropolitan Sergius of Singapore and Southeast Asia said that \\"today we speak not of the establishment of a 'parallel Church' but of the restoration of the ecclesiastical mission of the Russian Orthodox Church. It is conditioned by the need to provide pastoral care to our compatriots in all parts of the globe including Asia, as well as by the impossibility of our flock at present to partake of the Mysteries in the Church of Constantinople as it has entered into communion with schismatics and invaded the canonical bounds of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine\\"  Structure  Since 26 February 2019, the exarchate is divided in four dioceses: *Diocese of Singapore (comprising Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia), always headed by the primate of the PESEA * (comprising North and South Korea) * Diocese of Thailand (comprising Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and the Myanmar) * Diocese of Philippines and Vietnam (comprising the Philippines and Vietnam) On the same day, Metropolitan Sergius (Chashin) was appointed as ruling bishop of the Singapore diocese, as well as locum tenens of the other 3 dioceses. On 4 April 2019 Archbishop Theophanes was appointed by the Holy Synod as primate of the diocese of Korea.

In its general sense it describes a lake or reservoir which has its water level controlled by some form of dam. In the specific, it refers to three small lakes within the New York City water supply system's Croton Watershed lying within central Putnam County in the state's far southwestern corner. Types Control of water level The water level of Lake Coeur d'Alene in Idaho is controlled by the downstream Post Falls Dam The term \\"controlled lake\\" is used to describe a body of water - whether a natural lake enlarged by emplacement of a dam, a formerly dry area flooded and dammed, or a stretch in a natural watercourse such as a stream or river dammed to create a manmade empoundment - that has its level controlled by a dam. The purpose of the dam - whether to generate electricity, manage flood control, provide water for drinking, irrigation or recreational opportunities, increase shoreline real estate values, or any combination thereof - does not matter; nor does the size of dam or water body created, which can vary between an oversized pond controlled by a floodgate or the nearly Lake Mead empounded by the Hoover Dam, only that the water body's water level is artificially controlled. Last, it does not matter whether the water body is referred to as a \\"lake\\" when in reality it is a reservoir; that is merely a matter of convention, often tracing back to the body's name in its natural state.

On 24 February 2019, the aircraft operating the flight, a Biman Bangladesh Airlines Boeing 737-800, was hijacked southeast of Dhaka by lone wolf terrorist Polash Ahmed. The crew performed an emergency landing at the Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong where Ahmed was shot dead by Bangladeshi special forces. One flight attendant was shot at during the hijacking, but there were no other reported casualties among the 134 passengers and 14 crew on board.  Aircraft  The Boeing 737-8E9 aircraft (MSN: 40335/5715) registered S2-AHV was built in 2015 and first flew on December 11, 2015. The aircraft was the second of the type delivered new to Biman Bangladesh Airlines from Boeing in late 2015. At the time of the hijacking the aircraft was 3 years and 3 months old.  Events   Prior to hijacking  According to the online aircraft tracking service FlightAware, S2-AHV was flying its third flight of the day as Flight 147. At 10:18, it flew as Bangladesh 1203 from Shahjalal International Airport to Shah Amanat International Airport. Then at 14:43, it flew as Bangladesh 1204 back to Dhaka, landing at 15:21. The previous flight was a special flight carrying Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina to Chittagong. The aircraft was serviced and flight and cabin crew were changed, and just under two hours later at 17:13, the aircraft departed for Dubai.  Hijacking  Cabin crew noticed the perpetrator acting strangely for most of the flight; he was supposedly armed with a toy pistol. The plane diverted and performed an emergency landing. Passengers were evacuated. The suspected hijacker was identified as a man in his mid-20s who demanded to speak with his wife and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Assault  The 737 was boarded by Bangladeshi special forces who demanded that the hijacker drop his weapon. When the hijacker failed to comply, he was shot dead. It is not known how many shots were fired. Hijacker The Rapid Action Battalion identified the hijacker as Polash Ahmed of Narayanganj after his fingerprints matched with those of a person in the criminal database. He was previously accused in an abduction case filed on February 22, 2012. He used Mahibi Jahan as his Facebook profile name. He was the former husband of National Film Award winning actress Shimla; the couple divorced in November 2018. He had a two- year-old son from an earlier marriage.

She is currently a professor of finance and management science at the University of Alberta where she has taught since 1972. Alice Nakamura was also the first female president of the Canadian Economics Association in 1994-1995. She was also the president of the International Association for Research on Income and Wealth from 2014-2016. She is married to Masao Nakamura (current professor at the University of British Columbia) and is the mother of Emi Nakamura (current professor at the University of California, Berkeley). Alice Nakamura is also the daughter of economist Guy Orcutt, and the sister of economist Harriet Orcutt Duleep.http://www.irwincollier.com/michigan-johns-hopkins-and-harvard- three-generations-of-economics-phds-orcutt-nakamuras/  Education and work  Alice Nakamura obtained her bachelor of science in Economics with a minor in Political Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1973. She pursued her Ph.D. in Economics with a doctoral minor in Sociology from Johns Hopkins University in 1973. Today, she is best known for her focus on labour economics, quality management, official statistics, and genomic statistics. She also focuses much of her research on productivity and price measurement, employment, employment earnings and compensation policies as well as social policies and taxation, economic methodology and microanalytic simulation. Some of her most recent works include \\"Sourcing Substitution and Related Price Index Biases\\" wherein she alongside Erwin Diewert, John Greenlees, Leonard Nakamura and Marshall Reinsdorf explains how price indexes have become increasingly biased in business settings, \\"The impact of upstream firms' waste output on downstream firms' performance in Japan\\" wherein she (alongside Hitoshi Hayami and Masao Nakamura) uses input-output analysis to determine levels of waste materials of the Japanese manufacturing industries, and \\"Building the Innovation Union: Lessons from the 2008 Financial Crisis\\" wherein Nakamura (with Leonard Nakamura and Masao Nakamura) uses examples from the Great Depression and the 2008 Financial Crisis to argue that it is necessary to extend the EU efforts of innovation for tangible goods to innovation for processes and regulatory processes.  Scholarship  Alice Nakamura has written and edited 14 books and journal issues and is the author of 82 refereed articles and book chapters. She was also the first woman to publish in the American Economic Review (the second undergraduate student, after Robert Heibroner‚Äôs first publication over 25 years prior). Alice Nakamura writes many of her works in cooperation with her husband, Masao Nakamura.  \\"Difficulties Assessing Multifactor Productivity for Canada\\" (2012)  In 2012, Alice Nakamura collaborated with some colleagues from the University of Alberta to assess data produced by Statistics Canada. Together with Michael Harper and Lu Zhang, Alice Nakamura investigates why Canada‚Äôs Mutlifactor Productivity Index (MPF) which is estimated by Statistics Canada was lower in 2011 than in 1977 (94.8 and 97.6 respectively) although many policies were introduced to improve Canada‚Äôs productivity. Together with other economists, Nakamura argues that the MPF estimated by Statistics Canada is reflective of the nations‚Äô actual productivity. They contend that Statistics Canada use fragile sources to calculate the MPF where small over or understatements lead to irregularities in the measurement. By bringing attention to the transparency of the Bureau of Labour Statistics of the United states, Nakamura and colleagues indicate that the Canadian productivity debate would benefit from similar levels of transparency. They also present large differences between the MFP found for Canada and the United States while hypothesising that given their similar economies and histories their MFPs should be much more similar. They conclude that this is very likely due to errors and misestimates in the procedures used to calculate the MFP and that much more research is needed to settle this debate.  \\"Price Dynamics, Retail Chains and Inflation Measurement\\" (2011)  Together with her daughter Emi Nakamura, and Leonard Nakamura, Alice Nakamura examined price dynamics in retail chains and inflation measurement in the United States. They examined weekly price changes in hundreds of grocery stores. This work is particularly unique because it includes such a large data set, reaching tens of millions observations every year from 2001 to 2005. They focus on the chain drift problem, which is the bias caused by price bouncing (from temporary sales) which over time leads to an overall drift in price of the product. In this paper, they compare the prices of Coffee, Cold Cereal and Soft Drinks across and within chains. They include prices of these products during retail sales as well as the frequency of these sales. Using this data, they then calculate price indices and come to the finding that these affect measures of inflation as well as future forecasts. These price indices are affected by temporary sales. Nakamura et al conclude that the characteristics of the retailer are key in pricing dynamics and thereby emphasise on the importance of using such a large sample size. They find that price dynamics are more similar within chains and therefore the chain drift problem will appear to be alleviated the chain drift bias. However, Nakamura et al suggest that in order to solve the chain drift problem, drift-free indexes such as those used in Germany, Italy or Spain should be used.  \\"Wal-Mart Innovation and Productivity: A Viewpoint\\" (2011) Alice Nakamura collaborated with Richard Freeman, Leonard Nakamura, Marc Prud‚Äôhomme and Amanda Pyman to analyse Wal-Mart, the biggest private sector employer in Canada and one of the most important retailers in the United States. In the United States, one fourth of all productivity comes from the retail sector, and a sixth of this is attributable to Wal-Mart. It is also an important player in imports from China, Russia, Australia and Canada and continues to grow its productivity. They use the MGI (McKinsey Global Institute) report which indicates that within the merchandise sector, Wal-Mart contributed to around a third of the productivity improvement between 1987‚Äì95 and that Wal-Mart stands out because of its high productivity which puts it far ahead of its competitors. However they also criticise the MGI‚Äôs ability to accurately measure productivity because the only product for which measurements were taken from was pharmaceuticals wholesaling. Wal-Mart is the leader in a number of domains, including data warehousing, data enabled supply chain coordination, product codes and bar code labels, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) use, and E-recruiting. Nakamura and colleagues use these points to demonstrate Walmart‚Äôs high productivity. They draw on research from Basker, who found that Wal-Mart prices decline as the association grows, and that there has been a long-run increase in retail jobs, but a decline in wholesale jobs. This is because Wal-Mart typically manages its own warehousing and the workers working in this sector are likely counted as retail workers. Other workers may also lose their jobs at competitive companies as Wal-Mart continues to expand, which is another reason for the decline in wholesale employees. Nakamura and colleagues then focus on Wal-Mart in Canada: In Canada, retailers tend to be smaller, and therefore more vulnerable to the rising productivity of Wal-Mart. By analysing Wal-Mart‚Äôs productivity , they find some support that the introduction and spreading of Wal-Mart in Canada increased employment and labour productivity in the country. They also note however that there may not be enough data to make accurate conclusions such as those of the United States. Wal-Mart also benefits from receiving discounted shipping rates, and possibly special prices from producers, which decreases its unit input costs to below those of its competitors. Lastly, Nakamura and colleagues raise some of the measurement issues made by the MGI, which could have effect on the accuracy of their analysis. Nevertheless, they note that Wal-Mart has made major jumps toward higher productivity, and are now benefiting from this by carrying a large percentage of the retail market share in both, the USA and Canada.  \\"Aging Female and Foreign Workers, and Japanese Labour Markets: an International Perspective\\" (2011)  Alice Nakamura writes this chapter alongside her husband Masao Nakamura and Atsushi Seike in the book entitled ‚ÄòChanging Japanese Business, Economy and Society‚Äô. In this chapter, Nakamura and colleagues give an overview of the Japanese economy and point out areas for improvement in an international context. After World War 2 there were a number of economic protests throughout Japan, but the economy fully recovered by 1960, and flourished until 1990. Since 1990, Japan has been in a long recession, characterised by its inability to redirect capital towards increasing productivity and high unemployment rates. Therefore, it has been difficult for Japan to compete with US and European firms, who through trade agreements such as NAFTA and the EU have gained the comparative advantage in the production of many goods. Nakamura sheds light on Japan‚Äôs ageing population which in theory should reduce unemployment rates but in reality increases taxes paid by, and number of people outside the workforce supported by workers. The Japanese work culture is characterised by lifetime employment, which leads to high investment in human capital, multi-task skills within the firm and minimum concern about job loss. Seniority based wages are also a defining factor of Japanese work culture, and have the advantage that workers keep long-run consequences of their work in mind. However, Nakamura emphasises that these cultural aspects often do not apply to women or older workers. This is because firms generally do not consider hiring those in the middle of their careers, and women therefore often do not return to the workforce after bearing children because they are unable to find a job. Where the United States have taken steps to decrease discrimination towards female workers, Nakamura believes that Japan has not paid sufficient attention to this issue. Japan specialises in precision work and high standards of quality control, but faces high costs in maintenance and recently there have been increases in disparities between these domains and what is deemed competitive at the economic market. Japan has lost its comparative advantage in manufacturing, and therefore has increased its need to re-assess and change these systems.

It began in response to a 2012 decision by the Arizona Superintendent for Public Instruction calling for the removal of books from classes that \\"promote the overthrow of the United States government, foster racial and class-based resentment, favor one ethnic group over another, or advocate ethnic solidarity\\". Protesters organized a caravan which transported more than 1,000 banned books into Arizona. The caravan was relaunched in 2017 to coincide with a hearing about ethnic-studies courses in the Arizona Supreme Court. The protest received the Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award at the American Library Association's Midwinter meeting in 2013. History In January 2012, Arizona Superintendent for Public Instruction John Huppenthal ruled that Mexican-American studies classes being held in the Tucson Unified School District violated Arizona law ARS 15-112, which forbade classes that \\"promote the overthrow of the United States government, foster racial and class-based resentment, favor one ethnic group over another, or advocate ethnic solidarity\\". As a result of this ruling, the classes were \\"converted ... to standard grade-level courses with a general curriculum\\", and books used in these courses were removed from classrooms and \\"moved to the district storage facility\\". These actions were met with significant protests, including school walk-outs. The Librotraficante movement was one of the protests arising from the decision. Led by author and activist Tony Diaz, the movement comprised a caravan from Houston, Texas to Tucson in March 2012. The caravan included authors of books removed from classrooms as well as intellectual- freedom activists, and was intended to \\"smuggle [the removed books] back into the state\\" while raising awareness of the decision and promoting Latino literature. It gathered over one thousand copies of the books to create \\"underground libraries\\". The caravan made stops in El Paso, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico along its route, and established a library with some of the books at a Tucson youth center. Diaz launched the movement with a one- minute, forty-one-second video that introduced three new words to the political discussion: \\"Librotraficante\\" (\\"someone who smuggles banned books back into Arizona\\"), \\"wet-book\\" (a book smuggled into the state by the caravan for use in \\"underground classes to illegally conduct Latino literary studies\\"), and \\"dime book\\" (a paperback once valued at $10 \\"but now invaluable 'thanks to your fascist laws, Arizona'\\"). The caravan was relaunched in 2017 to coincide with a hearing about ethnic-studies courses in the Arizona Supreme Court.

Superseded by larger, drive-through vessels, she was converted to bow-loading and moved to Largs and later to Scalpay where she served until 1983. History MV Coruisk was built in 1969 to provide additional capacity at Kyle of Lochalsh. The Skye crossing was an urgent problem when STG took over control from 1 January 1969. The existing vessels were side-loading and could not keep up with increasing demand. In August 1969, it was announced that two new 28-car bow-loading ferries were to be built. Coruisk was built to provide additional short-term capacity until these would enter service. Once the larger ferries arrived, Coruisk was no longer required for Skye. Coruisk was converted to bow-loading and began a short crossing from Largs to a new slipway on Great Cumbrae. This service was successful and by July 1972, she was joined by Kyleakin II (renamed and also converted from turntable ferry to bow-loading). When that service obtained its own drive-through vessel, in 1977, Coruisk saw relief service throughout the network including Scalpay. The arrival of the first Loch class vessels in 1986, made Coruisk redundant again. In 1986, she was sold to Euroyachts Ltd. of Glasgow and in 1987 to a new owner in Penzance. Following a further sale in 1988 to Lampogas S.p.A. she was renamed Lampomare Uno. Layout Coruisk was similar to and with side ramps. Unlike her sisters, she had a passenger lounge. In 1971, she was converted to bow-loading, with a hydraulically operated bow ramp and could then carry eight or nine cars. Service Initially joining a fleet of older, side-loading vessels at Skye, Coruisk was displaced by arrival of the new and in 1971. She then inaugurated a new service to Cumbrae until demand there warranted a new drive-through vessel. For the remainder of her CalMac career, she relieved throughout the network. Lampomare Uno carried hazardous cargos to Elba from mainland Italy.

The side has taken part in one edition of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League and two editions of the now-defunct Papua New Guinea National Premier League, having achieved relatively little success in either.  History  From 2008‚Äì2014, the company Gigira Laitepo, a daughter company of Hides Gas Development Company, sponsored Morobe FC, until they withdrew their sponsorship ahead of the 2015 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League season. Ahead of the 2015‚Äì16 season, a side with the name of Gigira Laitepo United was accepted into the Southern Conference ‚Äì a new franchise with a similar name to the Morobe franchise that took part in that season's Northern Conference. In January 2016, the side accepted sponsorship from Kumul Petroleum Holdings. The side picked up their first competitive victory on 29 November 2015 with a 3‚Äì2 victory over FC Port Moresby. That would be their only victory in the first half of the season, however, before the club signed Solomon Islander Patrick Miniti Jr. to boost their hopes for the second half of the season. After a second victory against PS Huawei, the side were still in contention for playoff qualification with two matches to go, but they were unable to capitalise on this chance and eventually finished 5th out of six teams. The club were one of several franchises to break away from the Papua New Guinea Football Association in 2017, and this saw the side take part in the 2017 edition of the new National Premier League under a new name ‚Äì Gigira Amoana. The side opened their campaign in the Southern Conference with an 11‚Äì0 thrashing of Admiralty FC on 22 April 2017, but the side failed to win any of their first round fixtures against the rest of the division, with their second win of the season coming against Admiralty again on 27 May. The side avoided finishing at the bottom of the conference with a final-day victory ‚Äì their third of the season ‚Äì over Rapatona, who finished beneath them. The side were also selected to take part in the 2018 season of the NPL, in which they were once again drawn in the Southern Conference. They finished 4th out of 4, after drawing one match and losing the remaining two.

Ioane Minchkhi's four hymns are included in Iadgari of Mikael Modrekili (Tropologion) (978-988). His name has become known in academic circles thanks to Ivane Javakhishvili, who discovered the hymns of this unknown Georgian hymnist in Georgian manuscripts during his academic trip to Mount Sinai in 1902.

After Grand Prince George reestablished the old town of Kleshchin as Pereslavl-Zalessky, the ruins of the older settlement were donated to the monastery. During the troubles of 1611, the Poles under Jan Piotr Sapieha took the fortress after two weeks of siege and reduced it to ashes. The young Tsar Peter I selected it as his residence when he played with his amusement fleet on the nearby lake. In 1754, the monastery is recorded as owning 2000 serfs and 14 villages. The Soviets used it as a labor camp (in 1948-1953) and a military base (in 1953-59). The great dome of the katholikon collapsed in 1984 following many decades of neglect. The Russian Orthodox Church reclaimed the property in 1993 and had it restored. The compound has a chain of fortifications and two main churches, all dating from the reign of Ivan the Terrible. The first Tsar is supposed to have prepared the monastery to become his emergency residence in case of a boyar revolt. A later addition to the compound is the tall Neoclassical bell tower rising above the main gate; it dates from 1818.

The Sasanians successfully captured the fortress. Background The 541 capture of Petra was part of Khosrow I's invasion of Lazica. This campaign commenced when the Sasanian king was invited by the local king Gubazes II. The siege After passing through the difficult terrain of Lazica, the Sasanian forces met and joined Gubazes II. The main objective of the campaign was to capture Petra, where the magister militum per Armeniam John Tzibus had concentrated his forces and had established a monopoly in the port city. Khosrow sent a detachment under Aniabedes to attack the fort, where he found the fort apparently deserted. A detachment that was sent to destroy the gate with a battering-ram was defeated as the Byzantine forces quickly rushed out of the gate in a surprise raid. The Sasanians then camped near the fortifications and began a regular siege. On the following day, the Sasanians went completely around the fort and began shooting with arrows, and the Byzantines responded by shooting with arrows and war engines. The Byzantine commander John was killed by an arrow in the neck, demoralizing the defenders. Petra featured a rough terrain and unusually strong defensive towers, which, instead of being hollow, were made of solid stone to a great height. Nevertheless, the Sasanians managed to bring down one of the two great defensive towers through mining operations: much of the lower stones were removed and replaced by wood by the miners, and the tower fell as the flames slowly loosened the upper layers of stone; the tower was suddenly brought down and the Sasanians entered the fort through the walls. The besieged forces then surrendered and came to terms. The possessions of the rich commander/merchant John Tzibus were seized, but everything else was untouched, and the surviving Byzantine forces joined the Sasanian army. A Sasanian garrison was established in Petra. An account cited that in the course of the siege, many Persian soldiers died due to the difficult terrain, an epidemic, and lack of supplies. Leif Inge Ree Petersen notes that Roman commanders were killed (without specifying names) during the defense of Petra.

The band was founded in 2001 and is under contract to V√°n Records. The group has released three studio albums. History The band released three demo and two rehearsal recordings as well as several EPs and singles in the first years. Actually, the first demo Necromantic Doom should be the band's only release. In 2006, the band got signed by Sepulchral Voice Records, and a year later, the debut album Triune Impurity Rites was released.Frank St√∂ver: NECROS CHRISTOS . Soon, the drummer Luciferus Christhammer left the band and was replaced by Raelin Iakhu. Over a period of four years, the musicians worked on their second album Doom of the Occult, which was released in the spring of 2011 and was well-received by the press. In 2018, the band published Domedon Doxomedon, the third studio album. It was announced by the band that the album is intended to be their final album. The album peaked at #90 in the German charts. Style The music of Necros Christos renounces high speeds, blast beats and demonstrations of the technical skills of the musicians, and instead focuses on \\"slow, simple, panzer-like heaviness in conjunction with sinister growls and a strange, indefinable occult quality\\". In the context of the metal subculture, singer and songwriter Mors Dalos Ra sees the band more in the tradition of bands like Black Sabbath and Mercyful Fate in their occult orientation than in the modern-sounding, blastbeat-heavy death metal bands. His musical inspiration, however, comes more from the Eastern folklore, especially Persia, India and the Arab countries. As a further important source he gives Italian and German Baroque music and old occult 1960s / 1970s rock like Coven or Salem Mass, as well as The Jimi Hendrix Experience.Nate Poblete: . Mors Dalos Ra also writes the lyrics for Necros Christos. While his occult interests and studies are primarily Kabbalah-related, most texts deal with inverted Old Testament stories, the Apocalypse in the Apocrypha, ancient middle Eastern cultures, the mysteries of death, necromancy, black masses and copulation, mixed with his own experiences. Mors Dalos Ra explains the name of the band as another name of the amorphous entity of extreme damnation and darkness, the black brother of Christ, who is already known by names such as Ishtar, Ahriman, Shaitan, Satan and Lucifer.

He formed an alliance with fellow chieftains including Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo and Nadir Ali Khan before being subsequently hanged by the British authorities. Early life He was born on January 17, 1809 in Bhounro village of Lohardaga district. He was born in a Kayastha zamindar family. His father was Ramkishun Rai and Mother Sumitra Devi. His uncle Sadashiv Rai was Dewan of Nagvanshi Maharaja Jagannath Shahdeo. After death of his uncle Maharaja employ Ganpat Rai as dewan after seeing his capability. Pre-rebellion Pandey Ganpat Rai was zamindar of Bhunra and served as the diwan to the Maharaja of Chota Nagpur who belonged to the Nagvanshi dynasty. He was initially sceptical of the British presence in the region and believed them to be interfering in his work. After seeing atrocities of British, Ganpat Rai tried to convince Maharaja Jagannath Shahdeo against British but not succeed. His refusal to work with British officials led to him being dismissed from his role and in response he started to organise like-minded people to help him gain revenge. 1857 rebellion As the rebellion spread throughout the various regions of North India, both Ganpat Rai and Vishwanath Shahdeo decided to assume leadership with Ganpat Rai being named as the commander-in- chief. They assembled a force of around 1,100 men. They managed to recruit mutinying sepoys from Ramgarh and proceeded to throw the region into a state of anarchy causing many British officials to flee the area. Their end goal was to proceed through Palamu district and reach Arrah were they would join their forces with Kunwar Singh who was the leader of the rebel forces in North Bihar. Much of their initial success was due to the terrain of the region which was mainly forested and hilly allowing the rebels to escape easily. One of these conflicts later became known as the infamous Battle of Chatra in which British troops assisted by Sikh sepoys besieged the village of Chatra with each side suffering heavy losses before the British eventually drove them out. During this period, he declared that the British Raj had supposedly come to an end. In the meantime, the British forces led by Colonel Dalton were assisted by loyal zamindars including those of Ramgarh Raj. However, as they attempted to march towards Kunwar Singh's position, they were intercepted by a battalion led by Major English on the 2nd of October. In the ensuing battle both rebel leaders were defeated and retreated. Eventually after numerous skirmishes and battles with both local zamindars and the British, the authorities had managed to create a robust intelligence network and they were captured in March 1858 and then hanged on the 21st of April that same year. Legacy The governments of Jharkhand and Bihar have made many efforts to preserve the memory of Pandey Ganpat Rai. In 2012, the Jharkhand government organised the redevelopment of Pandey Ganpat Rai's village in Lohardaga district including the creation of new roads, a cultural centre and improved electric supplies. In 2017, members of the Indian National Congress also paid tribute to the rebel leader and referred to him by the title of Shaheed which means martyr. There is also a memorial badminton championship named after Ganpat Rai called the Pandey Ganpat Ray Memorial Badminton Championship which was inaugurated in 2018.

Biography Ladislav's father died of cancer when he was still little. His mother soon remarried, but she soon died of cancer as well. His inexperienced stepfather soon moved away, leaving Ladislav alone with his brother Jaroslav in an apartment in Motol. After completing a special school, he was trained by a glazier. His IQ was determined as 88, a below average score. Shortly before his capture, he lived in an apartment by himself because his brother had taken up military service. He was arrested on February 11, 1982, in connection with an investigation into the murder of Anna ≈†., committed at the beginning of October 1981. During the subsequent investigation, he indicated the existence of other victims, gradually admitting to another four murders, eighteen rapes and an attempted murder. Crimes * Eva R. (29) - He committed his first murder on December 1, 1978 in Dƒõƒç√≠n, where he said he \\"knew the beauty of [his] country, but also looked for some women.\\" He had been planning to visit Dƒõƒç√≠n, since he was passing by bus on his way to Germany. He attacked Eva R. on Elbe's embankment after he left the cinema, knocked her down, dragged her into some bushes and then strangled her. Hojer then proceeded to masturbate over the corpse. His victim had lived a very promiscious life. At age 29, she was married for the third time. On the day of her murder, she left her husband to visit the cinema, intending to later visit a lover at the crime scene. But the man forgot about the last meeting, and suspicion fell on both men. During the investigation, other lovers were found, including one who was wrongly accused of the killing. Like in several of the following cases, a man admitted to the murder for attention. * Ivona S. (25) - Another woman was murdered on the morning of February 9, 1980 on the night train R770 from Prague to Dƒõƒç√≠n. This medical student sat on their train with her husband, a military officer, but got off near their final destination. The man traveled by another train later. At that time, Hojer himself was in military service and was going to Dƒõƒç√≠n to visit a friend. He observed Ivona S. as she boarded the train. As she walked out of the toilet cubicle, he walked behind the woman and strangled her using her own scarf. There was not enough space in the cubicle to store the body, hence why he only masturbated for a bit before he proceeded to throw Ivona's body out from a window. He disembarked at a station in √öst√≠ nad Labem and in about two hours returned to Prague with another train. Ivona S.'s body was eventually found around 8 o'clock in the morning by the ƒåSD cleaning service. A witness in √öst√≠ had spotted a soldier who was in a hurry but could not describe him in detail. Since the other 46 passengers were identified, this soldier became the main suspect. Hojer had an alibi, as his disappearance was not recorded on the day of the murder. The investigation was then accompanied by a number of coincidences: one of the suspects, a railroad worker, committed suicide. In his apartment, there were newspaper clippings about the case and an English-written medical book, though the man did not know English himself. He had also told colleagues that he hoped the authorities close the investigation. Another suspected was a distant relative of the victim, who, although almost ignorant of the case, broke down while attending her funeral and also committed suicide. The lost plastic bag which was with Ivona's clothes was never found. At the time, this was a highly mysterious case. * Unknown (25-35) - In August 1980, again during his military holiday, Hojer went to see a friend, this time in Ko≈°ice. He decided to see the Ru≈æ√≠n reservoir dam, which was a sought-after recreation site. Due to bad weather, however, the place was abandoned, except for a lonely woman on the shore who was observing the dam. Unlike his other attacks, Hojer did not even call out to the woman, but the victim fought back. But when she was strangled, he prematurely ejaculated and lost interest. Her body was tied up with some found wire, heavied with a stone and thrown into the water. After the act, the tank was flooded. The body was discovered by workers on October 11, 1981, already at a considerable stage of decay (the head and wrists were non-violently separated from the body). According to the clothing brand Triola, she was a Czechoslovak national aged between 25 and 35 years of age. It was determined that the woman hadn't had any surgeries performed or any major injuries, which prevented the use of medical records to identify her. Due to the inability of Slovak investigators to find out more information, the woman's identity remains unknown. * Ivana M. (18) - On January 30, 1981, he arrived in the morning in Brno and traveled all day. By about 3 o'clock in the morning, he came across the attractive Ivana M. at a tram stop, as she was returning from a local zoo. He tried to talk to her, but Ivana ran away. Hojer shoved her to the ground and dragged her to the local park, where he tried to rape her, but then proceeded to stab and finally strangle the woman. He then cut off her breasts and genitalia with a scissor blade, which he took home in a plastic bag. He placed the breasts on the table top, penetrated his penis into the genitalia that he had cut off beforehand and then put the remains in a refrigerator. After about a week, he cooked them in salted water and tried to eat some of the \\"devilish\\" mustard and horse radish. But the dish did not taste good, so he flushed the remains down the toilet. The victim has suffered 39 stab wounds and her wallet, jewelry and watch were stolen. The first suspects were part of the large Greek community that Ivana often met up with. Later on, a Jordanian student admitted to the murder before he unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide. In the subsequent interrogation, he said he had admitted to the gruesome killing in order to divert attention from his academic failures, thus heavily damaging the reputation of his family. * Anna ≈†. (51) - The last murder was committed on October 3, 1981, at 22 o'clock near the victim's residence near the bridge over Motolsk√Ω Potok in Prague 5. Hojer wandered around the premises for at least an hour before he passed by 51-year- old Anna ≈†., who was returning from an evening concert. Because of her good looks, he considered her younger and persuaded Anna to have sex. The conversation was limited to four sentences, after the woman had her dress and stockings slit with a knife before being raped. Finally, Hojer pulled her stockings over her head and strangled Anna ≈†. so she couldn't identify him. He then threw her overcoat over her head so nobody except the killer and the investigators would know the cause of death. Her cry was heard by a large number of witnesses, but nobody connected it with a violent sexual assault. The body was discovered by a random passer-by who wanted to relieve himself in the bushes. This is the only murder that worried Hojer, as he then proceeded to walk 300 meters from his residence and went to work at his job at the glassblowing workshop. He was afraid that people would notice something and discover the killer. He even admitted to the murder several times in his favorite pub, but nobody took him seriously. * Attempted murder - Only by a lucky coincidence by a young girl, sitting drunk at a curb next a tram stop, survived an attack by Hojer. He dragged her into a nearby park, where he stripped the girl and tried to rape her. However, he had an erection problem and hence forced oral sex on her. He also pushed various objects into her vagina and asked her to put her hand there. The girl was covering her mouth all the time and was pushed by the neck, losing consciousness several times. The girl eventually managed to persuade Hojer to continue at her home, where no one would disturb them. She asked him to dress her up because she could not go naked on the street. So he let her go and put her clothes back on, but the girl pushed him away and ran down the street. Hojer caught and then knocked her on the ground, before proceeding to hit her head on the pavement several times. Her shouting was heard by a policeman, who accidentally leaned out of his apartment window and shouted \\"You will leave her!\\" at the assailant. The would-be killer mocked the wounded girl and then fled. Investigation, conviction and execution He was arrested on the basis of the testimony of a mentally-ill patient who admitted to the murder of Anna ≈†., but the investigation later revealed that he had been securely behind bars the entire time. But the man knew how she was murdered, which was still unpublished information. Finally, the patient told the authorities that his friend showed him the scene of the crime and told how Anna was killed. That friend was Hojer, who thereafter admitted to the murder. Later, particles of cloth from his trousers were found, along with other things, as well as his blood type coinciding with the saliva and sperm samples secured at the crime scene. Hojer also possessed a knife, which he used to cut up the victims' garments. During 1982, he admitted to another murder, bringing the count to five. Criminologists believe he committed at least two other murders, but he did not admit to them. Hojer made the confession exclusively in writing, because he was ashamed of some of his deeds and refused to speak with anyone. For his brutal deeds, he was sentenced to death. He also withdrew his confession once. Although there was a possibility that he had committed other crimes, there was anxiety about trying to confuse the investigators with false accusations, so the investigation was closed. Ladislav Hojer was executed on August 7, 1986 in Pankr√°c Prison. Before he was punished, he expressed his fear of death, and the execution was delayed twice due to the offender's illness.http://www.odsouzeni.estranky.cz/clanky/co-prinesla-media/rozhovor-s- poslednim-ceskym-katem_-pred-popravou-rvacka_-po-ni-panak-rumu___.html Personality According to expert opinions in psychiatry, sexology and psychology, he was a primitive psychopath: an amoral, anabolic personality with schizoid features and aggressive tendencies. Criminal behavior was committed in uninterrupted consciousness and deliberately made it more difficult to reveal. He was able to hinder and correct his repeated actions. His attitude toward murders is indicative of insensitivity and brutality, the absence of at least additional sympathy, conscience or regret. The reports showed that: * mental disorder was not detected, * resocialization, even a long-term punishment, is not possible, * protective treatment in a closed psychiatric institution is not proposed. A clear guideline for explaining Hojer's motives was his exclusively negative experience with women. He tried to establish the acquaintance by using an ad. A well-dressed woman arrived at the meeting, promising to get acquainted with a financially secure middle-aged man. Hojer repulsed her with his appearance, repulsed, and reproached so hard that she had left after a few minutes. It was much more promising for Hojer to become acquainted with the young woman he met at a party with his friends. She offered him sexual intercourse in the next room. It is likely that Hojer's panic has fallen as the woman has become active and moved away. He tossed it so hard that the door's glass filled through, and ran away from the apartment. Later, he learned that this girl, with a very bad reputation, spoke to his acquaintances with him. He was always very vulgar and contemptuous about women, but he was rather passive and uncertain in their presence. He did not know how to communicate with women, and he often imagined the scenes in which the helpless girl prayed for mercy. During the investigations and in particular reconstructions, Hojer built a special and almost friendly relationship with the criminalists. Chief Investigator Ji≈ô√≠ Markoviƒç even wanted to invite him to his home for a Sunday lunch. This idea was eventually summoned by his colleagues. When the Slovak murder was clarified, there was no company available, so Markoviƒç had to play Hojer's game. Reconstructions were often very problematic because they were too much in the situation, and therefore the living folks were instead replaced by mannequins. In some reconstructions, the investigators met the threats of visiting citizens who demanded Hojer's release and lynching. Hojer did not understand their reaction, which clearly testifies to his inability to understand the seriousness of his crimes. Another distinctive feature of Hojer's personality was a very dark sense of humor. One day, for example, he offered criminalists in the car that when he stops at two trackers they were passing by, he is \\"wicked and killed\\" to have a quick case. His remarkably primitive way of expression was remarkable. He used the turns like \\"I took oxygen; I caught her behind my mouth; she remained in my hands; I did not care what drunk, especially that she had a good skeleton \\", etc. He said rhythm as his motto: \\"When my tail stands, my brain stops.\\" The imminent death penalty did not allow himself until the last minute and even enjoyed his stay in custody. It was the first time in his life, when he became the focus of one's interest.

Replaced by larger ferries in 1970, she was converted to bow- loading. As MV Largs, she moved to the Cumbrae Slip crossing where she served until 1976. History MV Kyleakin was built for the increasingly popular Skye crossing. In 1961, the Kyle of Lochalsh slipway was enlarged so that two of the turntable ferries could load there at the same time. In 1965, Kyleakin was at the centre of demonstrations against the commencement of Sunday sailings. These were initially seasonal but ran all year round from October 1969. In 1970, she was renamed Kyleakin II, to make way for one of the new 28-car double-ended ferries then under construction. Layout Kyleakin was built with side ramps and a deck-turntable. She had no passenger lounge. In 1970, she was converted to bow-loading, with a hydraulically operated bow ramp. She lost her side-ramps and deck-turntable. Service Kyleakin joined a fleet of small vessels at Skye that struggled to meet increasing demand. In anticipation of the arrival of new ferries, Kyleakin II spent the 1970 summer season at Scalpay with such success that her sister MV Lochalsh (II) became the regular vessel there. With the arrival at Skye of the new and in 1971, the remaining three side-loaders were surplus to requirement. The converted proved so successful on the new Cumbrae Slip crossing that Kyleakin II, renamed Largs was similarly converted to bow-loading and joined her. This deployment continued until 1977 when both were replaced by the new . While relieved widely, Largs remained as backup at Largs. She gave her last public sailing at Largs on 26 September 1983 and was subsequently sold to Ardmaleish Boatbuilding Co. Ltd at Port Bannatyne, Bute.

Cellemetry was designed to operate over the existing cellular network, allowing it to be rapidly deployed. History Cellemetry was invented by Peter Roach, Scott Laster, and Ed Comer in 1994 while working for BellSouthsm. BellSouthsm partnered with Numerexsm to offer Cellemetry and Numerex eventually acquired the rights to Cellemetry data service.https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2003/03/31/daily10.html Numerexsm was eventually acquired by Sierra Wireless. The Cellemetry network was decommissioned when the cellular network transitioned from analog to digital cellular. Sierra Wireless still uses the Cellemetry name, with a different technology.  Products and technology  Cellemetry operated by sending messages over the signalling channel of the analog cellular network.http://alarmsbc.com/tech/pdf/overskyroute.pdf It used a non-dialable telephone number as the device identifier and inserted a device generated data message in place of the phone serial number. The Cellemetry device would then send out a registration message to the home cellular system. The Cellemetry message would then transverse the SS7) signaling network along with normal traffic. When the message arrived at the home cellular system, a specialized server would act as the home location register (HLR) and would take the message off of the cellular network and send it to the intended application or application service provider. Cellemetry Enabled Power Meter For an outbound message, the Cellemetry server would receive a message from an application or service provider, and then send a 'ring' signal to the device as if it was ringing a normal cellular telephone. The inbound channel (device to the network) channel was much more robust than the outbound channel (network to device). Outbound messages were generally restricted to trigger messages that caused a large number of devices to perform an action, report status, or other similar action. For example, an outbound messages might cause a set of vending machines to report their inventory level, change pricing, etc. Later versions of Cellemetry used other signaling messages such as USSD messages as the outbound messaging mechanism. Cellemetry had a number of advantages that led to its widespread adoption worldwide. *CSMA-style channel sharing with exponential backoff. * Since the Cellemetry messages were carried over the cell site signaling channel, they tended to have a higher coverage than cellular voice calls. This was mainly due to the architecture of the signaling channel where the messages are repeated several times (typically three) and included check bits. This allowed Cellemetry devices to be placed further into buildings or on the edge of the cellular coverage were normal voice calls may not have been possiblehttps://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e5/b4/2e/203d20bddce458/US5526401.pdf * Cellemetry devices utilized many of the components of a traditional analog cellular telephone. This allowed the Cellemetry devices to take advantages of the cost efficiencies of the rapidly growing cellular telephone base. Many early Cellemetry modems were analog cellular telephones without the human interface or the case. As the analog cellular network was phased out, the analog Cellemetry devices were eventually discontinued or transitioned to the GSM network using an different technology. Legacy Cellemetry was used for monitoring and control of: * Highway crash attenuators, traffic control signal, flood water, and tower beacons * Railroad equipment / signalsl * Public busses * School buses * Automatic vehicle location and wireless information systems * Trucks * Alarm systems * Shipping container location * Refrigerated transport * Vending machines * Galvanic corrosion for pipelines  References  External links   Category:Telemetry Category:Internet of things Category:1996 establishments ","title":"Cellemetry Data Services"},{"id":"60061426","text":"When the Night Calls is the second studio album by English alternative country duo Mt.

Many of these techniques are similar to the ones used for inspecting metal welds. Traditional techniques include visual testing, radiography, and various ultrasonic techniques. Advanced ultrasonic techniques such as time of flight diffraction (TOFD) and phased-array ultrasonics (PAUT) are being increasingly studied and used for inspecting plastic pipeline welds.Hagglund F, Spicer M, Troughton M.

Non-destructive identification of weld-boundary and porosity formation during laser transmission welding by using optical coherence tomography.

Nondestructive testing of nonmetallic pipelines using microwave reflectometry on an in-line inspection robot. IEEE transactions on instrumentation and measurement. 02/2019;68(2):586-594. doi: 10.1109/TIM.2018.2847780 The main purpose of NDE is to detect defects in the weld and the joint fit-up. Examples include joint mismatch, cracks, porosity, voids, inclusions, lack of penetration and lack of fusion (cold joints). However, the lack of defects does not necessarily mean the weld is adequate and thus NDE does not provide a good indication of weld strength, long term performance, or its ability to handle cyclic loading. Although destructive testing gives a better indication of actual joint strength, it's impractical to use on production welds since the sample is destroyed. Hence, the need to use and develop NDE techniques to ensure sound welds are being produced during production welding.  Visual Testing (VT)  Visual testing is one of the most basic and inexpensive methods. It consists of a technician visually observing the joint and comparing it to a set of acceptance criteria based on code of construction. Its use is mainly limited to joint fit-up and detecting surface breaking flaws. It can be done as an in-process inspection, while the welding is occurring, or on the completed weld. In-process inspections can show problems with the weld such as discoloration, indicating thermal degradation, bubbles, scratches, and weld bead problems. Visual inspection of the completed weld can detect joint fit-up and tool problems such as mismatch, angular misalignment, notches, and insufficient weld size as well as surface breaking weld defects like porosity, cracks, and excessive flash. As with most NDE techniques, technical training, experience, and skill is important for a successful inspection.  Leak Testing  Leak testing is commonly used for piping and pressure vessels due to the safety, reliability, or environment consequences of a leak once in service. The part to be tested is filled with water, air, or other type of fluid. Depending on the application, testing can be done at atmospheric pressure, under a positive pressure, or under vacuum. Evidence of leak can either be visual or by observing a change in pressure. When positive pressure is used, testing with non-compressible fluids is safer than using a gas. Gasses under pressure contain a significantly higher amount of stored energy than liquids and a rupture can pose a significant safety risk.  Radiography (RT)  Radiography uses an X-ray tube or radioactive source to give an image of the weld. Its use is similar to metal welds and provides a volumetric inspection which can show defects in the weld not visible from the surface. For plastics, a lower radiation intensity is typically required than that for metal welds, due to the lower material density. Because of the higher cost, it's typically only used in critical applications like pipelines and not for commercial products.  Ultrasonic Inspection  Various forms of ultrasonic inspection are used for plastic welds. Plastics have higher attenuation and a lower sound velocity compared to metals which can make these techniques more challenging. In 2010, a joint European project, TestPEP, was started to develop and validate ultrasonic NDE techniques on plastic welded pipe. The use of plastic pipe is limited in safety critical applications due to the lack of accepted NDE techniques and acceptance criteria. For butt welded plastic pipe, TestPEP proposed the use three different ultrasonic techniques. TOFD with PAUT probes to inspect the majority of the weld, traditional PAUT to look for flaws in the middle of the fusion zone, and a creeping wave to inspect the top of the weld.  Inspection of polyethylene pipe in nuclear power plants  One area that has driven research on NDE of plastic welds is the use of High-density polyethylene (HDPE) in nuclear power plants. Metal piping has traditionally been used for cooling water piping; however, HDPE offers significant advantages due to its significantly longer service life and its strength to weight ratio.Zheng J, Zhang Y, Hou D, Qin Y, Guo W. A review of nondestructive examination technology for polyethylene pipe in nuclear power plant. Frontiers of Mechanical Engineering. 12/2018;13(4):535-545. doi: 10.1007/s11465-018-0515-9. ASME Code Case N-755 covers the use of HDPE in Class 3 safety related piping; however it has not been endorsed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). One of the concerns is that although N-755 requires that NDE be conducted on pipe welds, it does not specify the method or acceptance criteria. In 2009, the NRC began to allow the use of HDPE in safety related applications, but on a case by case basis with NRC approval. In 2008, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory published a report based on a project sponsored by the NCR to study NDE techniques for HDPE welds.  Microwave Reflectometry  Research in the use of Microwaves (electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz) has been conducted on HDPE piping to inspect the fusion weldsZhu, X. W., Pan, J., & Tan, L. (07/2013). Microwave scan inspection of HDPE piping thermal fusion welds for lack of fusion defect TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD. doi:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.333-335.1523 as well as to scan the pipe wall via an internal crawler to find defects (similar to pipeline pigging). Microwave reflectometry works similar to ultrasonic inspection techniques in that the microwaves are reflected back towards the source (backscattered) as they pass through materials with different permittivity or encounter defects such as voids and cracks. Zhu et al. experimented with the use of a 21.6 GHz probe to scan the fusion butt welds of HDPE pipe. They compared a reference scan of a good weld with scans of welds with lack of fusion and cold welds. These types of weld defects can be difficult to detect since they don't necessarily result in laminations that would strongly reflect a signal. The defective welds were made by adding various delay times between the end of heating and start of fusion as well as welding with low temperature and pressure. In the scan images, the good weld appeared as a uniform line. The defective welds exhibited various discontinuities and a non-uniform appearance. Mechanical testing of the welds showed a marked decrease in properties, with reductions in the yield stress of one-third to one-half the value of the good weld. Their research did not include the development of quantitative acceptance criteria which would be needed for use in production applications. Carrigan et al. used a pipe crawler operating in the K-band frequency range (18-16.5 GHz) to inspect HDPE pipe for various defects that would be commonly found in buried and undersea pipelines. Three types of set- ups were used to model the conditions of above ground pipelines, plastic lined metal pipe, and undersea pipelines. Defects were modeled using notches and holes in the outside of the pipe. The crawler was design with the microwave probes on a rotating head and sensors on the wheels to measure travel distance of the crawler. They were able to identify 1mm wide and 1mm deep defects on a 9.8 mm thick pipe wall for the above ground and undersea set-ups. However, they were unable to identify small defects in the plastic lined metal pipe due to the strong reflection from the metal. They also found that the probe frequency, standoff distance from the pipe wall, and orientation of the probe played a significant role in the ability to identify defects.  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)  OCT has traditionally been used in the medical field but has found increased use in industrial NDE applications. K. Kim et al. studied its ability to identify weld defects in laser welding polycarbonate to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer. They used the maximum laser intensity of the system (10 times that required) in order to obtain a perfectly welded region and an imperfectively welded region. During laser welding, air bubbles can form and cause a degradation in the mechanical properties of the joint. Current inspection techniques are limited to finding air bubbles on the surface of the weld (optical and scanning electron microscopy). Destructive testing is usually required to find volumetric flaws. A 840-nm SD-OCT system with a broad band laser was used to scan the laser weld between the two samples. 800 A-scans were used to create a 2D image and 1000 images were put together to make the final 3D image. By looking at the border region between the perfect and imperfect weld, they were able to evaluate the effectiveness of OCT in finding weld defects. Air bubbles were visually apparent in the imperfectly welded region. The cross section of the 3D always showed a distinct difference between the perfectly welded region and the border region and the gap between sample in the non-welded region could easily be seen. By slicing the 3D image in different planes, additional quality information was obtained on the size and distribution of the various flaws. Since this in an optical inspection technique, its use is limited in materials that allow laser light to be transmitted through it.

It is a common name for all hypothalamo-pituitary axis disorders, which can be observed mostly after long term use of opioids, both as a treatment and as a substance of abuse. The effect of opioids on hormonal levels can be measured immediately after the application of the opioid. The onset of deficit mostly comes after longer time of use of high doses, but sometimes coexisting factor like cancer disease, pain disease or other medicines may accelerate the progress.  Pathophysiology  Opioid-induced hypogonadism, caused by negative effect of opioids on hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis is most often ( 21-86% of opioid users). Hypogonadism is induced through direct inhibitory action of opioids on receptors within the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal (HPA) axes as well as testosterone production within the testes. Opioid-induced hypogonadism and direct negative effect of opioids to bone formatting leads to osteoporosis. The opioid effect on adrenal hormone production, somatostatin and thyreoid levels is less common, but should be considered as well due to the serious impact on the patients total health. Effect on hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis is well described both after short acting and long acting treatment with opioids, resulting in cortisol deficit. It might lead to the problems in stress situations, immunodeficiency and Addison crisis. Opioid-induced hyperprolactemia can lead to the painful growth of breast (gynecomastia), milk production (galactorhea) and hypogonadism. Opioid- induced defect of hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìsomatotropic axis leads to growth hormone deficiency which in adults results in cognitive dysfunction, mainly affecting visuospatial memory and orientation.  Symptoms  Testosterone deficit at men leads to erectile problems, infertility, depression, anxiety, night sweat and hot flushes. Premenopausal women due to the low estrogen levels struggle of irregular menstruation, infertility or complete menopause. Postmenopausal women might have lower levels of dehydroxyepiandosterone, LH and FSH as well leading to fatigue and depressions. Fatigue, higher incidence of infection diseases, problems with wound healing and total exhaustion during infects or Addison crisis are symptoms of cortisol deficit. Pathological fractures in early age at opioid users must indicate bone density evaluation and osteoporosis suspition. Desorientation in the previously well known surrounding can be the symptom of GH deficit.  Treatment  If cessation or decreasing of doses of opioids is possible, endocrinopathy can be reversed. If the treatment with opioid cannot be disrupted due to the serious reasons, for example in substitution program or due to the severe pain or cancer, the hormonal substitution should be considered. It seems like opioids with partial antagonistic action, like buprenorphine, effect hormonal levels less.

In August 1890, John Lidgerwood became the first American diplomat assigned to Surabaya. At the time until Independence of Indonesia in 1945, Surabaya was the largest city in Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia. East Java also economic hub of Dutch East Indies because of the bustling spice trade and dominated Surabaya as the largest port in Nusantara. The consular agent would report back to the American Embassy in The Hague (Government seat of Dutch Empire) on American interests in Surabaya. The United States Consular Agency was a highly active post, largely due to the industrial development taking place in and around Surabaya, much of involving American companies such as General Motors. In 1918 it was elevated to full Consulate status, with offices located at Jalan Darmokali 38. Many important visitors passed through the consulates, including Senators Millard Tydings and McAdoo, as well as Margaret Mead, the famous American anthropologist. Over the years, the Consulate has also had the opportunity to entertain other well-known persons. In 1931, Claudette Colbert visited Surabaya, and in 1933 Charlie Chaplin also arrived at Surabaya. The Consulate moved on Jalan Raya Dr. Soetomo 33 in 1950. On August 1, 1990 the Consulate upgrade status to become a Consulate General in recognition of the economic importance of Surabaya and East Java.

However, after pressure from the United Kingdom and France on the government of King Otto of Greece, he was forced to recall the chieftain taking part in the rebellions throughout the Greek-inhabited regions of the Ottoman Empire, including Macedonia. The governments of the United Kingdom and France had assumed that the rebellions were related to the Crimean War (1854‚Äì1856). In Southern Macedonia, the chieftains of Mount Olympos and fighters from independent Greece and Thessaly and Magnesia captured the Vale of Tempe and some parts of Pieria. In Western Macedonia, the revolutionaries led by Theodoros Ziakas took control of the western Pindus and attacked the area of Grevena, but the numerical superiority of the Ottoman army and the hostile stance of the United Kingdom and France resulted in the signing of an armistice and the return of the chieftains to Greece on June 1854. The second phase took place in Chalkidiki and it was led by Tsamis Karatasos, former adjutant of King Otto. Karatasos had disembarked in Sithonia in April 1854, but he confronted the French forces which continuously fired on him, as they were afraid of his possible entrance into Thessaloniki. After a brief capture of Karyes in Mount Athos, whose monks hadn't supported the rebellion, Karatasos had to return to Greece on a French naval ship. The consuls of the United Kingdom and France took over the protection of the non-combatants and of the fighters who had supported Karatasos from a possible Ottoman invasion of Mount Athos.

He completed his entire career with the French club of the US Dax. With an international selection with the France team, he plays most of his career in the US Dax, but also RC Narbonne. Biography Pierre Darbos begins the practice of rugby XV with the club of high school of Dax, Gen√™ts, from the season 1952-1953. He is the brother of Claude Darbos, also a rugby player, whom he joined in the US Dax the same year. Under the direction of Jean Desclaux, he won with the cadets the championship of France twice, in 1955 and 1956. He wears from the youth categories the jersey of the French team, from his first season in the club Acquois. He also played the same year, his first match with the first team of the US Dax, in the context of the semi-final Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1952, conceded against the Paloise Section; third line training wing, he played this match at center post. Pierre Darbos officially joins the ranks of the first team from the 1958-1959 season, being initially called to play mainly Challenge Yves du Manoir meetings; he won the 1959 edition of the competition, beating the Pau-finals section in the final, which he played alongside Claude Contis, his team-mate since the junior category. He then plays his first championship final of France in 1961, lost against AS B√©ziers. At the beginning of the 1961-1962 season, Darbos became a regular holder of the USD once his military service was completed. After a semifinal loss in overtime against SU Agen, he made a request for a sport transfer, and then joined RC Narbonne. He played three seasons in the Aude club, during which he won a national selection with the France B team, and reached the semi-final of the national championship in 1964. He rubs shoulders with the Spanghero brothers during their debut. After an elimination in the round of 32 in 1965, Darbos chose to return to his training club. On his return, he fights the 1966 final lost to SU Agen, and loses two years later the final of the Challenge against his former teammates RC Narbonne. He nevertheless obtained consolation by winning the Challenge final the following season, at the expense of FC Grenoble. Eager to join the France team for the Springbok tour, he follows a suitable training program, but is not called. After a demonstration in front of the members of the French Rugby Federation, in the context of a confrontation on the ground of Fumel to celebrate the inauguration of their new stadium, Pierre Darbos is called the following day in honorary selection for a meeting against a selection Romanian, played in Bucharest in November 1969. A few weeks later, he was finally selected in the national team, receiving his first international cape on December 14 during the annual confrontation against Romania; Darbos and the France team won 14-9 in Tarbes. Darbos also shares his first selection with another player from Acquire, Jean-Pierre Bastiat. He finally ended his playing career a year later, having won one last time the Challenge Yves du Manoir, this time against Stade Toulousain, as a substitute. For his professional reconversion, he moved to Bayonne with Anne Darbos, his wife, occupying the position of commercial director of the local brand Lapeyre group.

Sion has never previously hosted the Olympics but bid for the Olympics in 1976, 2002 and 2006. The 2026 bid was withdrawn after a local referendum in which 54% of voters rejected it. History At first, five Swiss bids were submitted to the Swiss Olympic Association:'Sion 2026: Swiss Made Winter Games', 'Graub√ºnden and partners 2026', 'Central Switzerland 2026', '2026 - Games for our future' and 'Switzerland 2026'. In October 2017, the Swiss government announced its support for the Sion 2026 bid. The next month, a public vote was scheduled for the 10 June the next year. The bid's preliminary feasibility report predicted that bringing the Olympics to Sion would cost CHF1.86bn and produce direct revenue of CHF1.35bn. The canton of Valais pledged CHF60m and the Swiss government promised to give the bid CHF995m. The Games budget was later reported to actually be CHF2.4bn by radio station RTS. In April 2018, the Swiss Olympic Association confirmed Sion as an 'interested party' in the 2026 Games. In May 2018 it was announced that the Host City Contract would be signed jointly the canton of Valais and the city of Sion. Public vote The plebiscite held on 10 June 2018 had 216,548 eligible voters and saw a turnout of 62.6%. 71,579 people (or 53.98% of the vote) rejected the bid and 61,019 (or 46.02% of the vote) accepted it. 1,049 ballots were left blank and 1,912 were invalidated. Overall, the cities voted more strongly against the bid while the mountain provinces were more accepting. All of the cities in the canton voted to reject the bid with a majority of 55% or more except Visp which had a smaller 'no' vote, at 51%. Philippe Varone, the mayor of Sion said that there was \\"no plan B\\" after the rejection of the bid at the public vote. The Sion 2026 bid was formally ended during the Dialogue Stage of the IOC selection process, leaving six other bids still in the running: Milan, Italy; Graz, Austria; Stockholm, Sweden; Erzurum, Turkey; Sapporo, Japan and Calgary, Canada. Of these, three cancelled their bids in the Dialogue Stage and the Turkish bid was not invited to join the Candidature Stage, leaving the Italian and Swedish bids as the only willing hosts. Previous bids The last time Switzerland held an Olympic Games was the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. Sion has never previously hosted the Olympics but bid for the Olympics in 1976, 2002 and 2006.

Title In French, the novel is entitled La Migration des c≈ìurs (literally 'the migration of the hearts'). Speaking in 2016 to Fran√ßoise Pfaff, Cond√© explained the title thus: \\"J'ai vu dans ce titre une mani√®re d'exprimer que l'histoire se r√©p√©tait; il y avait une premi√®re g√©n√©ration avec Cathy qui √©tait aim√©e par Razy√© et par de Linsseuil et une deuxi√®me g√©n√©ration avec Cathy II, fille de Cathy, aim√©e par Premier-n√©\\" (\\"I saw in this title a way of expressing how history repeats itself; there was a first generation with Cathy who was loved both by Razy√© and by de Linsseuil, and a second generation with Cathy II, daughter of Cathy, loved by Premier-n√©\\").PFAFF, Fran√ßoise, Nouveaux entretiens avec Maryse Cond√©: √©crivaine et t√©moin de son temps, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 2016 p. 122. Style In the original, Windward Heights is predominantly written in standard French, but characteristed by Cond√©'s characteristic blending of French with Guadeloup creole, with no explication for the reader. Cond√©, opposed to thinking of the French language as immutable, has likewise opposed the idea that a ready distinction can be drawn between standard French and creole. In a 2016 interview, she argued that \\"Il n'y pas le fran√ßais. Il y a le fran√ßais de Proust, de Chateaubriand, de Maryse Cond√©. J'ai dit clairement par la suite: 'Je n'√©cris ni en fran√ßais, ni en cr√©ole, j'√©cris en Maryse Cond√©.' C'√©tait une r√©ponse aux angoisses que j'avais connues d'utiliser une langue qui ne m'appartient pas. Le fran√ßais et le cr√©ole appartiennent √† ceux qui les utilisent\\" (\\"There is no French. There is the French of Proust, of Chateaubriand, of Maryse Cond√©. I have said clearly later: \\"I do not write neither in French nor in Creole, I write in Maryse Cond√©.' It was a response to the anxieties I had to use a language that does not belong to me. French and Creole belong to those who use them\\").PFAFF, Fran√ßoise, Nouveaux entretiens avec Maryse Cond√©: √©crivaine et t√©moin de son temps, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 2016, p. 64.

Summary Windward Heights was inspired by Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights, and Cond√© has described the work as a homage to Bront√´. It transposes the Yorkshire moors in the island of Guadeloupe. Thus, she retains the characters of Cathy and Heathcliffe (who becomes Razy√©) but transposes them into a Creole identity. The Linton family becomes the \\"De Linsseuil\\" family, who live on the Belles-Feuilles estate (and no longer Thrushcross Grange as in English), and the Earnshaw family becomes the Gagneur family who inhabit the Engoulevent estate (like Wuthering Heights in English). As a result, The Migration of Hearts can be considered a postcolonial rewriting. The novel comprises forty-one chapters and is divided into five parts which each represent one of the islands (Cuba, Basse-Terre, Marie-Galante, Roseau) where the story takes place. Maryse Cond√© remains faithful to Bront√´'s novel by telling the story of Razy√©'s revenge on the Linnseuil family. But, unlike Bronte's story, Conde makes sure that Cathy and Razy√© have a child, Cathy II. The secret of this liaison is always kept and it is because of this that Cathy II and Razy√© II marry: driven by an inexplicable love, they are attracted to each other. As a result of their affair, they also have a child, a little girl named Anthuria. Razy√© II and Cathy II take refuge in Roseau and it is only after the death of Cathy II that Razy√© II returns to the Engoulevent estate with his daughter. Main characters * Anthuria: daughter of Cathy II and Razy√© II. This character does not exist in Bront√´'s text. * Aymeric: husband of Cathy II, taking on the character of Bront√´'s Egar Linton. * Cathy: the lover of Razy√©. Often characterized as a wild girl by her family, she is married to Aymeric. She is Cathy in Bront√´'s text and nicknamed \\"Man Razy√©\\", which is Creole for \\"Mrs. Razy√©\\", in Cond√©'s text. * Cathy II: daughter of Cathy II and Razy√©, the wife of Razy√© II. * Irmine Linsseuil: wife of Razy√©, taking on the character of Isabel Linton in the text of Bront√´. * Justin- Marie: Gegneur's child, he takes over Hindley's character in Bronte's text. * Razy√©: a child found by Hubert Gagneur, but considered natural child in Cond√©'s text. He takes on the character of Heathcliff in the English novel. Cond√© selected Razy√©'s name as a wild plant of Guadeloupe, echoing how the name Heathcliff alludes to the Yorkshire Moors in England. * Razy√© II, or Premier-n√© ('firstborn'): child of Razy√© and his wife, Irmine Linsseuil. He is the husband of Cathy II, who is also his half sister. Inspirations Alongside Wuthering Heights, Cond√© has invoked the work of Jean Rhys as an inspiration, particular her Wide Sargasso Sea (based on Jane Eyre).PFAFF, Fran√ßoise, Nouveaux entretiens avec Maryse Cond√©: √©crivaine et t√©moin de son temps, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 2016, p. 123.. ¬ª Further reading * BAHSOUN, Jihad, R√©√©criture et cr√©ation dans La migration des c≈ìurs de Maryse Cond√©, Paris, l‚ÄôHarmattan, collections : Critiques Litt√©raires, 2016. * COLLINS, Holly, \\"Towards a ‚ÄòBrave New World‚Äô : Tracing the Emergence of Creolization in Maryse Cond√©‚Äôs Canonical Rewritings\\", Women in French Studies, vol. 23, 2015, p. 69-84. * FRATTA, Carla, \\"Conjectures sur la gen√®se de La migration des c≈ìurs de Maryse Cond√©\\", Francofonia, N¬∞61, 2011, p. 163-172. * FOURNIER-GUILLEMETTE, Rosemarie, \\"(Dis)jonctions du postmoderne et du postcolonial dans la r√©√©criture.

James was an ice cream seller; \\"nothing else is known of him.\\" Accusation Julia Hotopp, 20, from a prominent family, reported on the morning of January 11 that she been assaulted by a \\"very black man, heavy-set, slight mustache, [who] wore dark clothes, and his toes were sticking out of his shoes.\\" The Commonwealth Attorney (prosecutor), Captain Micajah Woods, said after talking with her that \\"it was one of the most atrocious rapes ever committed. The circumstances were of such a character and so revolting that he was unwilling to state them in detail ‚Äî of a character to stir any community to its deepest depths.\\" Since Julia was by all reports uninjured, this presumably refers to the nature of the sexual act(s). James was quickly arrested and then identified by Hotopp; there is no recorded statement on whether James matched the description she had given, or whether his body showed the scrapes that must have resulted since Julia clawed her attacker so hard there were particles of his skin under her fingernails. He was taken to the scene of the crime and his shoes matched tracks at the scene. As he was returned to jail in Charlottesville a large crowd grew and there was talk of lynching. For his protection he was smuggled out of the jail (\\"taken over the north wall of the jailyard, through some private premises out by the wine- cellar\\"), and taken to the jail in Staunton, Virginia, where he spent the night. The crowd in Charlottesville was described as \\"outraged\\". \\"It became necessary to take some of them through the jail to satisfy them that the man had really been taken away.\\" A grand jury was convened for the following morning. Lynching As James was being returned to Charlottesville by train, a crowd estimated at 150 was waiting at the Wood's Crossing station, west of Charlottesville. When the train stopped, overpowering the police chief and sheriff who were escorting him, unmasked men took James from the train and, despite his protestations of innocence (some reports say he admitted his guilt), hung him from a tree near the station. Once he was hanging, members of the mob shot him; Hotopp's brother \\"emptied his pistol into the body\\". He received an estimated 40 bullets. People took pieces of his clothing as souvenirs. The fact that the train stopped at the Wood's Crossing station, where a crowd was awaiting it, was commented on in the press. One said that the escorts should have taken him on the fast train, which did not stop there; another said that they did take the fast train, but \\"it was flagged down by some one.\\" Another says that a man dressed in woman's clothing stood on the tracks, forcing a stop. \\"Several Staunton gentlemen who felt there would be a lynching got on the train and went along to see it.\\" At the time of the lynching, the grand jury was meeting, and had decided to indict him (\\"bring a true bill\\"), but the documents had not yet been prepared. The court adjourned when informed of the lynching but later reconvened and indicted the dead man for rape. The following morning, as a coroner's jury, they found that he \\"came to his death by the hands of persons unknown to the jury.\\" Although the lynchers did not conceal their identity, no one was ever charged with the killing. The only attacker whose name was recorded was Julia's brother, Carl. 2018 funeral On July 7, 2018, 120 years after the lynching, about 50 people met at the site and held a funeral for James, since there is no indication that he had one at the time (his burial site is unknown). Nikuyah Walker, Charlottesville Mayor, and Ann Mallek, a member of the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, were present, along with Susan Bro, mother of Heather Heyer, killed at the 2017 Unite the Right rally. Three containers were filled with soil: one for Charlottesville, one for Albemarle County, and the third for the collection of soil from lynching sites at the Equal Justice Initiative's National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama. The Albemarle County soil will be part of a traveling exhibit on James, which will visit every library in the county, before being installed \\"semi- permanently\\" in the County Office Building. The story of James is told on a new Albemarle County Web page, devoted to its participation in the Equal Justice Initiative's Community Remembrance Project. The next day, July 8, about 100 people from the Charlottesville area then set off by bus with the soil to Montgomery, on a \\"pilgrimage through the civil rights landmarks of the South\\". The group was \\"expected to return with a six-foot tall steel monument commemorating James' lynching\\". The University of Virginia allowed 10 employees to make this trip without having to use vacation time; Albemarle County allowed 2.

Drafted into the Red Army during the Russian Civil War, he had become a junior officer by its end and would be steadily promoted during the interwar period. After commanding two other rifle divisions during the expansion of the army in the late 1930s, Fokanov became commander of the 154th Rifle Division in 1940, leading it during the Battle of Smolensk, in the first weeks after Operation Barbarossa, and the Kozelsk Offensive, after the latter of which it was converted to the 47th Guards Rifle Division for its actions. After a brief period as deputy commander of the 5th Tank Army, Fokanov became commander of the 29th Guards Rifle Corps in 1943 on the Eastern Front and was transferred to command the 29th Rifle Corps more than a year later. After commanding the latter in the fighting in Pomerania during the final months of the war and the early postwar period, he served in staff positions before being sent to China as an advisor to the People's Liberation Army in the late 1950s; this was his last position before dismissal to the reserve in 1959.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Fokanov was born on 7 December 1899 in the village of Kononovo, Ustyuzhinsky Uyezd, Novgorod Governorate to a peasant family. After graduating from the village school, he worked in the logging industry between 1912 and 1917 and then became a farmer. During the Russian Civil War, he was drafted into the Red Army on 15 March 1919 by the Ustyuzhinsky Uyezd military commissariat and sent to the ski detachment of the Petrograd garrison. He was then transferred to the 2nd Reserve Rifle Regiment, stationed at the Peter and Paul Fortress, to carry out guard duty. In the fall of 1919, Fokanov fought with a ski detachment on the Petrograd front against the White Northwestern Army. After the defeat of the Northwestern Army, he was sent to the regimental school of the 11th Reserve Rifle Regiment in December 1919. Upon graduation in November 1920, he became an assistant platoon leader in the regiment. After the latter was disbanded, Fokanov served in the same position with the 10th Reserve Rifle Regiment before being sent to study at the 7th Petrograd Red Commanders' Courses in January 1921. During March, with a cadet brigade, he fought in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion.  Interwar period  From April 1921, after completing the courses, Fokanov served as a junior commander in the 10th Reserve Rifle Regiment, now part of the Petrograd Military District. When the latter was disbanded in June, he became an acting platoon commander in the machine gun regiment of the Petrograd Fortified Region. From October 1923, he studied at the 8th Petrograd Infantry Commanders' School, which was merged with the S.S. Kamenev Kiev Combined Military School in September 1924. After graduating from the latter in August 1925, Fokanov was placed at the disposal of the 135th Territorial Rifle Regiment and appointed an acting assistant platoon commander in its 9th Company. In October, he was transferred to the 138th Pereyaslav Rifle Regiment of the 46th Rifle Division of the Ukrainian Military District, with which he successively served as a platoon commander in the machine gun company, acting company commander, regimental treasurer, acting assistant regimental commander for economic units, and as a rifle company commander. Fokanov transferred to the 137th Rifle Regiment of the division in April 1931, serving as assistant and acting regimental chief of staff, then as chief of staff and battalion commander. From June 1934, he commanded the 57th Separate Machine Gun Battalion of the 54th Directorate of Construction Work ‚Äì the Rybnitsa Fortified Region of the Ukrainian Military District, which became part of the Kiev Military District when the latter split in May 1935. After serving as acting commander of the 259th Rifle Regiment of the 87th Rifle Division in the Kiev Military District from August 1937, Fokanov studied at the Vystrel course from November of that year until his graduation in August 1938. He was then appointed commander of the 87th's 16th Rifle Regiment, but in January 1939 took command of the 61st Rifle Division in the Volga Military District. Fokanov went on to command the 129th Rifle Division from August of that year, the 18th Reserve Brigade from January 1940, and the 154th Rifle Division from July of the latter year.  World War II  Fokanov held the rank of kombrig when Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began in June 1941. In July the 154th became part of the 63rd Rifle Corps of the Western Front's 21st Army. During the Battle of Smolensk, the corps temporarily repulsed German attacks and recaptured Rogachev and Zhlobin in a counterattack on 13 July. For his \\"skilled leadership\\" of the division during the counterattack, Fokanov was promoted to major general on 31 July. He then led the division with the 3rd Army of the Central Front in defensive battles on the east bank of the Dnieper, preventing a German crossing near Loyev. The division fought in the Oryol‚ÄìBryansk and Tula defensive operations in September and the recapture of Kaluga during the Kaluga Offensive in December as part of the 50th Army, initially with the Bryansk and then the Western Front. In August 1942, the 154th fought in the Kozelsk Offensive against the German 2nd Panzer Army, after which the Soviets claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on the German forces and to have forced them onto the defensive. For its \\"courage and heroism\\" in the offensive, the division was converted into the 47th Guards Rifle Division. His superiors assessed Fokanov as having shown \\"bravery and skilled organization of the combined operations of different branches\\". After the division was transferred to the Southwestern Front in the Stalingrad area during October, Fokanov became deputy commander of the front's 5th Tank Army in December during the advance of the latter toward the Donbass. From April 1943, Fokanov, promoted to lieutenant general on 28 April, commanded the 29th Guards Rifle Corps of the front's 8th Guards Army. He led it during the Donbass and Zaporizhia Offensives, during which it helped recapture Barvenkovo and Zaporizhia. For his leadership of the corps, Fokanov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class. From 6 September 1944, he led the 29th Rifle Corps, which, as part of the 48th Army of the 2nd and then 3rd Belorussian Fronts, participated in the M≈Çawa‚ÄìElbing and East Pomeranian Offensives, during which it captured Mak√≥w, Mak√≥w Mazowiecki, Przasnysz, Allenstein, and Braunsberg. Subsequently, he distinguished himself in battles to destroy the German forces around Heilsberg, receiving the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class.

A molecule of acrylonitrile is added to a nucleophile, for example an alcohol, thiol or an amine. : \\\\mathrm{YH + H_2C{=}CH{-}CN \\\\longrightarrow Y{-}CH_2{-}CH_2{-}CN} Due to the mesomeric stabilization of acrylonitrile and the electron withdrawing nitrile group, the Œ≤-carbon atom (the carbon atom that is furthest from the nitrile group) is positively polarized and therefore acts as a Michael acceptor. This leads to an approaching of the nucleophile to the Œ≤-carbon atom, which initiates the reaction. The reaction is terminated by absorption of a proton from the solvent by the intermediate product. In industrial applications, the reaction is normally catalyzed by a base that polarizes or (negatively) charges the nucleophile and thus accelerates the reaction.Hajime Kabashima, Hideshi Hattori: Cyanoethylation of alcohols over solid base catalysts, in: Catalysis Today, Volume 44, Issues 1‚Äì4, 30. September 1998, S. 277‚Äì283, . Cyanethylation is used especially in the industrial pharmaceutical and dye sector, since this reaction extends the nucleophile bearing molecule by three carbon atoms plus the -C‚â°N bond can afterwards be removed or modified by (for example) reduction. Cyanethylation is also used in technical polymerization. If cyanethylation takes place in a medium that cannot release a proton to the product at the end of the reaction, an anionic polymerization occurs. Due to the lack of protonation, the Œ±-carbon atom remains negatively charged, causing the individual cyanethylation products to polymerise.  Literature  * Jerry March: Advanced Organic Chemistry.

The feminist movement in Spain started during the 19th century, aiming to secure rights for women and striving for more than women could expect from their place in the home. Supported by a number of Spanish writers, it was one of the first feminist movements to inject anarchism into feminist thinking. In contrast to feminism developments elsewhere, many Spanish feminists sought to realize their goals in this period through the education of women. When political activity took place to further feminist goals and the more general aspirations of groups, it tended to be spontaneous and easily dismissed by men. Margarita Nelken, Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Sierra and Carmen de Burgos were all important pre- Republic writers who influenced feminist thinking inside Spain. The dictatorship of Primo de Rivera provided more opportunities for women to be engaged politically, with the appointment of women to the Congreso de los Diputados. Thought they were not successful, the first steps were also taken towards women's suffrage. Feminine independence, principally organized in Madrid around the Lyceum Club, was condemned by members of the Catholic Church and viewed as scandalous. Women continued to be locked out of political and labor organizations such as the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo. Feminism in the Republican and Civil War eras was typically about \\"dual militancy\\" and was greatly influenced by anarchism and by an understanding of potential societal developments. Yet increased women's emancipation was constantly threatened by leftist attempts to prevent their opponents from taking power. Most of the advances gained, including the right to vote, civil marriage, abortion and access to birth control would be lost before the Second Republic fell. Clara Campoamor Rodr√≠guez was the most important proponent of women's suffrage in this period. During the Civil War, mainstream leftist feminism often took on an individualistic approach to addressing inequalities, with battles as to whether their autonomy should be personal or political. Mujeres Libres, founded by Lucia S√°nchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n in May 1936, became one of the most important organizations for feminists. Dolores Ib√°rruri earned herself the nickname La Pasionaria as she traveled the country to speak in opposition to Francoist forces, making her one of the most visible and important feminist voices. Francisco Franco and his forces won the Civil War in 1939. Mainstream feminism subsequently disappeared from public discourse, largely being replaced publicly by an oppressive form of state- sponsored feminism that was no more than support for Spain's traditional gender roles that denied women personal and political autonomy. Traditional gender norms returned with force. Sanctioned feminist writing in the post-war period stemmed largely from the works of aristocratic women such as Mar√≠a Lafitte, Countess of Campo Alanaga, and Lil√≠ √Ålvarez. Works by Republican pre- war feminists like Rosa Chacel and Mar√≠a Zambrano, who continued to write in exile, saw their works smuggled into Spain. As a result, the contributions women and feminists had made during the Civil War were largely forgotten.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800 - 1922)  During the 1800s, the most important women advocating for women's rights in Spain were Teresa Claramunt and Teresa Ma√±e, both coming from the anarchist movement. √Ångeles L√≥pez de Ayala y Molero founded Sociedad Progresiva Femenina in 1898, one of Spain's earliest feminist organizations alongside Sociedad Aut√≥noma de Mujeres de Barcelona which she had founded in 1892. They built on ideas that were being developed by the North American feminists, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman. Spanish women were among the first to inject anarchism into feminist thinking. The feminism of Spain in the period between 1900 and 1930 differed from similar movements in the United Kingdom and the United States. It also tended to come from a liberal or leftist perspective. Spanish feminist intellectuals in this period included the militant socialist Mar√≠a Cambrils, who published Feminismo socialista. They also included Clara Campoamor, Virginia Gonz√°lez and Carmen de Burgos. One of the more notable pre-Republic feminists was lawyer and prison reformer Concepci√≥n Arenal. She believed it was important for women to strive for more in life than what was to be found in the confines of the home. The feminist movement began to get traction in 1915, when the National Association of Spanish Women (ANME) first started to work together to address women's needs. ANME's early feminism was characterized by its right wing leanings, as a result of its being associated with Spain's upper classes. The Seccion Varia de Trabajadoras anarco- colectivistas de Sabadell was founded by Claramunt and other like-minded women in 1884. Working with Ateneo Obreros, the organizations sought to emancipate both men and women through education. It folded sometime before late 1885. Agrupaci√≥n de Trabajadores was created as a labor organization in 1891 by Claramunt to support her feminist ideals, and soon organized public meetings. The organization argued that women were being doubly punished by society, as they were expected to work outside the home to provide for the family while at the same time having to meet all the domestic needs of the household. The organization was never particularly successful in its goals as many women in the workforce did not see a need for representation by a union. Bel√©n S√°garra had been involved with the Sociedad Aut√≥noma de Mujeres de Barcelona, an organization founded around 1891. She and Claramunt sought to create Associaci√≥n Librepensadora de Mujeres. S√°garra was prevented from doing so after being arrested in 1896 for being anti-Christian and promoting free- thinking.  Employment and labor organizations  While 17% of women worked in 1877, most were peasants who were involved in agriculture. Despite Spanish industrialization in Spain, including that of agriculture in the 1900s, restrictive gender norms meant only 9% of women were employed by 1930. This represented a drop of 12% or 0.5 million women in the workforce from 1877 to 1930. Prostitution was legal in pre-Second Republic Spain, and poor, white women lived in fear of being trafficked as slaves. By the 1900s, women could and did sometimes work in factory sweatshops, alongside young male workers. Most women seeking employment worked in the homes of the more affluent. These jobs paid so little that female workers often struggled to earn enough to feed themselves. When women were involved in factory work in this period, they were often paid half the wage of their male counterparts. Madrid in Spain, where much of women's labor movements and protests were taking place in pre- Republican Spain. Despite the lack of presence in the workforce, women did engage in labor protests in specific industries where they were over represented. This included labor action in Madrid in 1830, where there were five days of rioting over wage reductions and unsafe working conditions by 3,000 female tobacco workers. Women tobacco workers were also the first to unionize, creating their first union in 1918. The union was successful in doubling wages for its workers in 1914 and 1920. It also successfully had workers wages tripled in 1930. Their labor actions continued into the Second Republic. Despite their involvement in organizing labor in tobacco, women were largely absent from late nineteenth century labor movements in Spain. Although there were few opportunities for women, some did manage to get highly ranked government positions, though these were few and far between.  Political activity  The nineteenth century saw for the first time the emergence of a true middle class in Spain. This precipitated internal questioning among the Spanish elite about social inequalities that had existed in Spain since the founding of the modern Spanish state when Isabella of Castille married Ferdinand of Aragon, solidifying Spanish territory under one government. These discussions would see the creation of the First Spanish Republic from 1873 to 1874. A mathematics class organized by Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza in 1903 with a female teacher. The Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza (ILE) was founded by persecuted Spanish intellectuals, catering to freethinkers in educational facilities outside government control. The ILE was important in forming ideologies leading to the creation of the Second Spanish Republic. It was revolutionary in Spain in that it was one of the first organizations to recognize the potential of women, though this was still viewed as limited. To this end, ILE member Fernando de Castro, then dean of the Universidad de Madrid, created the \\"Sunday Lectures for the Education of Women\\" in 1868.  Direct women's involvement  As women in the pre-Republican period were largely confined to domestic spheres, their political activity tended to be centered, though not always, around issues related to consumer activities. Women protested and rioted in this period over goods and services shortages, high rents and high prices of consumer goods. Their protests were designed to encourage the government to change its practices by addressing these issues. Spanish Socialist Workers' Party () (PSOE) was founded in 1879 as primarily a labor movement organization. Its early pre-1900s membership was almost exclusively male, and they had no interest in women's issues or feminist goals. The first women's group inside PSOE was not founded until 1902. It would not be the last. PSOE's women's groups remained small and subordinate to larger, male-dominated socialist groups. The early 1900s, 1910s and 1920s also saw a growth of women in the workforce in sectors such as nursing and education. These women also joined unions. During the 1920s and early 1930s, women became more involved with socialist movements. This did not translate into participation on the political side, as socialist political organizations were openly hostile to women and not interested in attracting their involvement. When women did create socialist organizations, they were auxiliary to those dominated by men. This was the case for Group of Feminist Socialists of Madrid and Feminist Socialist Group. Unlike their anarchist peers, socialist women played much more passive roles. As a consequence, when the Civil War started, few socialist women headed to the front lines. Prominent women socialists in this period included Matilde Huici, Matilde Cantos and Matilde de la Torre. Largely participating in women's caucuses, their advocacy was often ineffective in pressing for women's rights as their position inside the broader socialist party governance structure was very weak. Despite barriers for political participation, some anarchist women were politically engaged in this period despite gender tensions which served to limit their participation. One example of such tension occurred during the 1918 Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) Congress, where gender-based tensions among anarchists in Spain were visibly present. Men tried to use the Congress to assert their own power over women to set goals and policies that would have them dominate both the public and private sphere. This was in large part because male anarchists did not want to see a power dynamic change which would result in diminishing their own status. Few women were involved in the Communist Party of Spain () (PCE), but Dolores Ib√°rruri joined by the early 1920s. An active participant in organizing labor strikes and a firm believer in women's rights, Ib√°rruri was elected to the PCE Central Committee in 1930. Two years later, she was the head of its Women's Commission. Prior to the Second Republic, PSOE recognized that women workers lacked a compensatory educational system and access to educational facilities equivalent to those of their male peers. Yet, despite this, they failed to offer any sort of comprehensive policy solution to the problem and were unwilling to advocate strongly on the need to address women's education. The extent of their activism for women's education were demands for integral education for men and women. The Feminine Socialist Group of Madrid met in 1926 to discuss women's rights. Attendees included Victoria Kent and Clara Campoamor.  Education  Mar√≠a de Maeztu was an early twentieth century Spanish feminist and pedagogist. She helped co-found the International Institute for Young Ladies in Spain in 1913 as part of larger collaborative efforts. Two years later, she founded the Residence for Young Ladies. Continuing to push for women's education in pre-Republican days, she founded the in 1926 with cooperation for the International Institute for Young Women. The Club was the first of its kind in Madrid. It would see its ranks include other important Spanish feminists of its day, including Isabel Oyarzabal de Palencia and Victoria Kent. It had over 500 members by 1930, and included a branch in Barcelona.  Women's media and writing  Margarita Nelken, Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Sierra, Carmen de Burgos and Rosal√≠a de Castro were all important pre-Republic writers who influenced feminist thinking inside Spain. Portrait of Carmen de Burgos by Julio Romero de Torres in 1917 Carmen de Burgos was not primarily known for her feminist writings in the pre-Republican period but rather for writing popular novellas. Despite that, her La mujer moderna y sus derechos in 1927 was one of the most important feminist works of its time. As a feminist, she started her writing career in the early 1920s as a relatively moderate feminist. Having written for various liberal and progressive newspapers from the 1900s to 1920s, it was only as time passed during the latter part of the decade that she became more radical and part of the First Wave Feminism. As a feminist, she advocated for reforms to Spain's legal system, including legalizing divorce and women's suffrage. Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Sierra wrote under the name Gregorio Mart√≠nez Sierra, publishing a series of four essays using her husband's name during the period from 19116 to 1932. These included Cartas a las mujeres de Espa√±a, Feminismo, femindidad, espa√±olismo, La mujer moderna, and Nuevas cartas a las mujeres de Espa√±a. Not until the death of her husband in 1947 did Mar√≠a de la O Lej√°rraga claim authorship of these writings and admit to intentionally trying to use a masculine name in order to gain credibility. The feminism she espoused in these letters was a paradox given the impression of male authorship. Her wider body of feminist work also sat outside the feminism being developed by Anglo women in North America and Great Britain, but was well received inside Spain as her plays were performed in Madrid's theaters. One of her major contributions was in changing the medium from which feminist themes were shared, her primary themes being the problem of subordination of women. Image de Rosal√≠a de Castro. La condici√≥n social de la mujer en Espa√±a was the most notable work of Margarita Nelken in this period. Published in 1919, it was revolutionary in Spanish feminism to the extent that it went beyond describing the problems of women to proscribing solutions, and advocating for changes in women's relationships to groups such as working and middle-class men, women of different classes, and institutions like the Catholic Church. Writing from a socialist perspective, her feminist works sought to address the conflict between the roles women were expected to maintain in a patriarchal society. Rosal√≠a de Castro, born in 1837 in Santiago de Compostela, wrote novels from a female point of view that addressed suffering at the hands of men, with this violence supported by the patriarchal society in which it took place. Her work took a more realistic approach to the condition of women, and their problems in overcoming social injustices that chained them to a certain way of life. She played an important role in calling for assistance for women seeking justice for the violence they suffered.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)  The Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera started in 1923 and continued until 1929, leading to elections being called for June 1931. This period saw few feminist events in Spain. When women did organize, men viewed their activities as a joke. Feminine independence, principally organized in Madrid around the Lyceum Club, was condemned by members of the Catholic Church and viewed as scandalous. It was viewed by some men as threatening to the status quo. Feminists in the dictatorship period were often focused on restrained but determined efforts to be nonconformist in their approach to womanhood. Most of their activity was devoted towards creating fictional works as a form of social criticism. Other feminist organizations also existed by 1920, though they were much less visible and less successful in their goals. They included the Future and Feminine Progressive in Barcelona, the Concepci√≥n Arenal Society in Valencia and the Feminine Social Action Group in Madrid. Most members came from middle-class backgrounds, and consequently did not represent the broader spectrum of women in Spain. The Feminine Socialist Group of Madrid met in 1926 to discuss women's rights. Attendees included Victoria Kent and Clara Campoamor. In the lead-up to the founding of the Second Republic and the Civil War, many middle- class and upper-class women who became feminists did so as a result of boarding school educations resulting in parents unable to guide the evolution of their political thoughts, fathers encouraging daughters towards political thinking, or being indoctrinated in classes essentially aimed at reinforcing societal gender norms. Left-leaning families were more likely to see their ideas manifested by their daughters as feminists as a result of their active influence. Right-leaning families were more likely to see their daughters become feminists through rigid gender norms resulting in a family break.  Political activity  When political activity was triggered by women in the pre-Republican period, it was often spontaneous. Women were often ignored by left-wing male political leaders. Despite this, their riots and protests represented increasing political awareness of the need for women to be more active in social and political spheres in order to bring about improvements in their own lives and those of other women. Middle-class women in urban areas, freed from labor in the home, started to lobby for changes to improve their own lives, calling for changes in divorce laws, better education and equal pay. When politicians were faced with these demands, they often labeled them \\"women's issues\\". No serious reforms could be achieved under the Primo de Rivera dictatorship. The 1927-1929 session of the Cortes Generales began the process of drafting a new Spanish constitution that would have fully franchised women voters in its Article 55. The article was not approved. Nevertheless, women were eligible to serve in the national assembly in the Congreso de los Diputados, and 15 women were given seats on 10 October 1927. Thirteen were members of the National Life Activities Representatives (). Another two were State Representatives (). These women included Mar√≠a de Maeztu, Micaela D√≠az and Concepci√≥n Loring. During the Congreso de los Diputados's inaugural session in 1927, the President of the Assembly specifically welcomed the new women, claiming their exclusion had been unjust. Loring Heredia interrupted the proceedings and demanded an explanation from the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts on 23 November 1927, marking it the first time a woman had spoken from the Congress floor.  Second Spanish Republic (1931 - 1937)  One of the most important aspects of the Second Republic for women is that they were formally allowed to enter the public sphere en masse. The period also saw a number of rights available to women for the first time, including suffrage, divorce and access to higher education. These resulted from feminist activities that pre-dated the Second Republic and continued throughout its duration. Feminism in the Republican and Civil War eras was typically about \\"dual militancy\\" and was greatly influenced by anarchism and an understanding of the role feminism should play in society. The Civil War would serve as a break point for feminist activity inside Spain. There would be little continuity in pre-war and post-war Spanish feminism.  Elections in the Second Republic  \\"Rep√∫blica Espa√±ola\\" (1931) by painter Teodoro Andreu. The Spanish monarchy ended in 1931. Following this and the end of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Second Republic was formed. The Second Republic had three elections before it was replaced by the Franco dictatorship. They were held in 1931, 1933 and 1936.  June 1931 Elections  Following the failure of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Spain set about writing a constitution. The initial draft did not give women the right to vote, though it did give them the right to run for office on 8 May 1931 for the June elections. Three women won seats in Spain's national congress, the Cortes, in the 1931 elections: Clara Campoamor Rodr√≠guez, Victoria Kent Siano and Margarita Nelken y Mansbergen. Campoamor, in arguing for women's suffrage before the Cortes on 1 October 1931, stated that women were not being given the right to vote as a prize, but as a reward for fighting for the Republic. Women protested the war in Morocco, those in Zaragoza protested the war in Cuba while even larger numbers protested the closure of Ateneo de Madrid by the government of Primo de Rivera. Campoamor also argued that women's inclusion was fundamental to saving the Republic by having a politically engaged populace, so that the errors of the French Republic would not be repeated. Kent, in contrast, received much more support from Spain's right, including Catholics and traditionalists, during this period of constitutional debate as she, alongside Nelken, opposed women's suffrage, believing women would vote along lines dictated by their husbands and the Roman Catholic Church. They also believed that most women were too illiterate to be informed voters, and their participation as electors would set back Republican goals and women's rights. Kent and Campoamor became involved in a grand debate over the issue, receiving extensive press coverage of their arguments concerning women's suffrage.  1933 Elections  Men and women wait at Escuela Biteri in Hernani to vote in the 1933 elections. For the first time, in 1933 women were permitted to vote in the national elections. The victory of conservative factions in the 1933 elections was blamed on women and the way they had voted. They were viewed as being controlled by the Church. Campoamor, along with Kent, lost her seat in the Cortes following the 1933 elections. The most active of the three women elected in 1931, she had been heckled in the congress during her two-year term for her support of divorce. She continued to serve in government with an appointment as head of Public Welfare later that year. However, she left her post in 1934, protesting the government's response to the 1934 Revolution of Asturias. Nelken faced similar problems in the Cortes. Her mother was French and her father was a German Jew. As a consequence, before she was allowed to sit in 1931, Nelken had to go through special bureaucratic procedures to insure she was a naturalized Spanish citizen. Her political interests were looked down upon by her male peers, including Prime Minister Manuel Aza√±a. Her feminist beliefs worried and threatened her male colleagues in the Cortes. Despite this, she was re-elected in 1933, facing attacks in the media. She proved a constant irritant to male party members who sometimes resorted to racist attacks in the Cortes to quieten her down. Still, she persevered, winning at the elections in 1931, 1933 and 1936. Disillusionment with the party led her to change membership to the Communist Party in 1937.  February 1936 elections  The February 1936 elections saw the return of a leftist government. Together, the various left-wing groups formed the Popular Front. They replaced a repressive right- leaning government that had been in power for the two previous years. The Popular Front won elections in February 1936 on a progressive platform, promising major reforms to government. In response, even as the left began reform plans to undo conservative efforts from the previous government, the military began planning how to overthrow the new government. The Popular Front, in contrast, refused to arm its own supporters, fearing they would fight against the Government.  Feminist organizations   Female Republican Union  Clara Campoamor created the Female Republican Union (Uni√≥n Republicana de Mujeres) during the early part of the Second Republic. The Female Republican Union was interested only in advocating for women's suffrage. It was often polemicist in its opposition to Kent's group Foundation for Women, and its opposition to women's suffrage. They believed now was the time to act, and if they failed to act, there may never be time for women to be granted the right to vote.  Foundation for Women  Victoria Kent and Margarita Nelken founded the Foundation for Women (Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Mujeres Espa√±ola) in 1918. The Foundation for Women was a radical socialist organization at its inception, aligning itself with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party or PSOE. The organization opposed women's suffrage, even as its founders sat in the Cortes. The belief was if women were given the right to vote, most women would vote as instructed by their husbands and the Catholic Church. This would fundamentally damage the secular nature of the Second Republic, by bringing in a democratically elected right wing government. They believed that it was better to address other issues facing women at the time and revisit the topic of women's suffrage later, when women were more educated and the right-wing threat was lessened. Kent's views led to the biggest and most visible feminist conflict of her disagreement and public battles with Campoamor during the period.  Political activity  The changing political landscape of the Second Republic meant that for the first time there was an environment in which women's political organizations could flourish. Women were also largely locked out of organized political groups in this period, even those claiming to be in favor of gender equity. Major trade unions at the time like the Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the CNT ignored specific needs of women, including maternity leave, childcare provisions and equal pay; instead, they focused on general needs or the needs of the male workforces they represented. The National Confederation of Labour (Confederaci√≥n Nacional de Trabajadores or CNT) perpetuated gender inequality, paying its female employees less than men in comparable positions. Only 4% of UGT's membership was female by 1932. One of the greatest challenges faced by leftist women was Marxism, prioritizing the issue of class equality over gender issues. For anarchists, trade unionists, and communist and socialist women, this often resulted in the male leadership dismissing women's needs. Women were not permitted to participate in their agenda as their needs did not directly relate to the class struggle. Some leftist men, both in political and labor organizations, also resented women entering the workforce, viewing their lower wages as an incentive for employers to reduce wages for men. Despite differences in ideology, communist, Republican and socialist women would meet for discussions about the political issues of the day. They also worked to mobilize women en masse to protest issues they felt were important. One such mobilization occurred in 1934, when the Republican government considered calling up its reserves for military action in Morocco. Within hours of the news hitting the streets, Communist, Republican and Socialist women had organized a women's march in Madrid to protest the proposed actio. Many were arrested, taken to police headquarters and later released.  Anarchists  On the whole, the anarchist movement's male leadership deliberately excluded women and discouraged them from seeking leadership positions. Women were effectively locked out of the two largest anarchist organizations, Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI). CNT total membership ranks were over 850,000 by July 1935, and were organized by region and sector of employment. Despite large numbers of women members, CNT ignored specific needs of women, including maternity leave, childcare provisions and equal pay; instead they focused on general needs or needs of men in the workforces they represented. The CNT also perpetuated gender inequality, paying its female employees less than men in comparable positions. FAI was created by more militant members of CNT. Women found it difficult to join the organization, and even more difficult to be granted leadership positions. Federaci√≥ Ib√®rica de Joventuts Libert√†ries (FIJL, JJLL or JJAA) was founded in 1932 as an anarchist youth organization, becoming the third most important anarchist organization of its day. Like the CNT and FAI, it largely rejected women's issues and discouraged women from becoming involved in its governance. Like the FAI and CNT, it focused on the rights of Spain's working class. ;Mujeres libres Existing tensions within the anarchist movement, resulting from the exclusion or discouragement of women by the male leadership, eventually led to the creation of Mujeres Libres by Lucia S√°nchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n in May 1936, shortly before the start of the Civil War. Suceso Portales served as the national vice-secretary. Initially based in Madrid and Barcelona, the organization had the purpose of seeking emancipation for women. One of their goals was \\"to fight the triple enslavement to which (women) have been subject: enslavement to ignorance, enslavement as women and enslavement as workers\\". It was from the anarchist movement that many militia women () were to be drawn. Mujeres Libres organized ideological classes designed to raise female consciousness. Compared to their fellow Second Wave feminists in the United States, they were more radical in that they provided job training skills, health information sessions, and reading classes. Better information facilities for women were viewed as critical if women were to participate in the wider revolutionary movement. Lack of education was one of the reasons men had sidelined many of the women in the movement, and Mujeres Libres sought to overcome the sexist approach. Believing women's liberation would require a variety of measures, they became ideologically closer to intersectional feminism. Mujeres Libres also set up (storefront cultural centers), which acted at the local level and decentralized governance, making it accessible to all. They avoided direct political engagement through lobbying of the government. They did not identify as feminist, as they saw goals of other feminists at the time as too limited in scope for the freedom they sought for their fellow women, perceiving feminism as too bourgeoisie. It was only in the 1990s that academics began to view them as feminists.  Anti-fascists  Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista (POUM) was one of the major anti-fascist organizations during the Second Republic. Its goals in the early part of this period included giving working-class women a feeling of empowerment. To this end, the Women's Secretariat set about organizing neighborhood women's committees to address day-to-day concerns of women living in specific areas. POUM's Women's Secretariat also gave weapons training to women in cities like Barcelona. They wanted women to feel prepared for the war that seemed inevitable. Known as the Women's Cultural Grouping in Barcelona, POUM's women's group also organized classes attracting hundreds of women participants. They focused on hygiene, knitting, sewing, reading, child welfare and covered a broad range of topics including socialism, women's rights, and the origin of religious and social identities. Contacts took place in this period between POUM's Alfredo Mart√≠nez and leadership in Mujeres Libres in Madrid about the possibly of forming an alliance although they did not result in any action.  Communists  During the Second Republic, Partido Comunista de Espa√±a (PCE) was the primary Communist political organization in Spain. Communists began to recognize the importance of women during the Second Republic, and started to actively seek female members to broaden their female basis in 1932. To further this goal, the first Communist women's organization, Committee of Women against War and Fascism in Spain, was created to attract women to Communist-connected unions in 1933. Membership for women in PCE's Asturias section in 1932 was 330, but it grew. By 1937, it had increased to 1,800 women. The Spanish Committee of Women against War and Fascism was founded as a women's organization affiliated with Partido Comunista de Espa√±a in 1933. It was a middle-class feminist movement. As a result of PCE male governance trying to remove women from more active roles in the Communist movement, its name was changed to Pro-Working Class Children Committee around 1934 following the Asturian miners strike. Dolores Ib√°rruri, Carmen Loyola, Encarnaci√≥n Fuyola, Irene Falc√≥n, Elisa Uriz and Mar√≠a Martinez Sierra, part of a larger group representing Spain's communist, anarchist and socialist factions, attended the 1933 World Committee of Women against War and Fascism meeting in France. During the Asturian miners action, the government of the Second Republic responded by arresting thousands of miners and closing down their workers centers. Women rose up to support striking and imprisoned miners by advocating for their release and taking jobs to support their families. PCE's male leadership strove to find roles for women that better suited their gender and were better fitted for the new, more conservative legal framework evolving under the Second Republic. PCE's goal, which was achieved, was to discourage women's active participation in labor protests. VII Comintern Congress in 1935 in Moscow had two representatives from the PCE, Ib√°rruri and Jose D√≠az. Ib√°rruri's profile rose so much during the Second Republic, while being coupled with the outlawing of the Communist Party, that she was regularly hunted by the Spanish police. This made it difficult for her to travel, both internally and externally. Being too close to her would also prove deadly. Twenty-three year old Juanita Corzo, a member of Women Against War, was given a death sentence in 1939 for aiding Ib√°rruri, later commuted to life in prison. Women in Partido Comunista de Espa√±a faced sexism on a regular basis, which prevented them from rising up the ranks of leadership. They were denied the ability to be fully indoctrinated by keeping them out of Communist ideological training classes. At the same time, men insisted women were not capable of leadership because they were not educated in these principals. The sexism these leftist women faced was similar to their counterparts on the right, who were locked out of activities of the Catholic Church for the very same reason. For the 1936 May Day celebrations, the Communist Party of Spain worked hard to convey a perception that they were one of the dominant political groups in the country by turning out party members in Madrid. They successfully organized hundreds of Communist and Socialist women to participate in a march, where they chanted \\"Children yes, husbands no!\\" () with their fists clenched in the air behind huge Lenin and Stalin banners. That year, the party was also successful in convincing many socialist women to embrace Bolshevism.  Republicans  Republican Union Party () (PUR) was the largest Republican party. Despite many divisions on the left, there were Communist and other women PUR community centers, where they would interact with leftist women and discuss the political situation of the day during the early period of the Second Republic. Participants included Dolores Ib√°rruri, Victoria Kent and Clara Campoamor. Many of these women were very knowledgeable on these topics, more so than many of their male peers. This cross-party collaborative discussion was at times threatening to male leaders such as those in the Republican Union Party, who in 1934 put a stop to it by posting police officers at the entrances to keep non-party members out. As a consequence, many women left the Republican Union Party.  Socialists  Prominent women socialists included Matilde Huici, Matilde Cantos and Matilde de la Torre. Women's caucuses were often very weak inside the broader socialist party governance structure. As a consequence, they were often ineffective in advocating for women's rights. In general, men inside PSOE began espousing a more militant approach to combating right wing actors inside Spain, continuing this thinking as the history of the Second Republic chugged along in the face of increasing numbers of labor conflicts and male leadership quarrels. This militancy though did not carry over into beliefs about activities for its female membership. Nelken was the political leader of the PSOE's women's wing. Her feminist beliefs worried and threatened her male colleagues in the Cortes. Despite this, Nelken was the only woman during the Second Republic to win three elections for the Socialists to serve in the Cortes. Her election wins came in 1931, 1933 and 1936. Disillusionment with the party led her to change membership to the Communist Party in 1937. During the immediate pre-Civil War period, Campoamor tried to rejoin the Spanish socialists but was repeatedly rejected. Her support of universal suffrage, feminist goals and divorce had made her an anathema to the male dominated party leadership. Eventually, in 1938, she went into exile in Argentina. Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Sierra served for a time as a Socialist deputy in 1933.  October Revolution of 1934  Asturias, Spain. Women played roles behind the scenes in one of the first major conflicts of the Second Republic, when workers' militias seized control of the mines in Asturias. Originally planned as a nation-wide strike, the workers collective action only really took place in Asturias. Some women were involved in propaganda and others in assisting the miners. After the government quelled the insurrection by bringing in Moroccan legionaries, some 30,000 people were jailed and another 1,000 were buried. A large number of those jailed were women. Women also played an advocacy role in trying to have their husbands and male relatives released. During the protests by the Asturian miners, the government of the Second Republic responded by arresting thousands of miners and closing down their workers centers. Women rose up to support striking and imprisoned miners by advocating for their release and taking jobs to support their families. Following this, Partido Comunista de Espa√±a tried intentionally to prevent its female membership becoming more politically active from within the party. During fighting in Oviedo, women were on the battlefield serving in a variety of roles. At least one attended to the wounded while shelling went on around her. Others took up arms. Still more went from leftist position to leftist position under active shelling, providing fighters with food and encouragement. During the Asturian conflict, there were a few instances of women-initiated violence. This fed into paranoia among those on the right that women would violently try to seize power from men. Neither on the left or the right were these women viewed as heroic; indeed, men hoped to limit their potential for further political action. Women were also involved in building barricades, repairing clothing, and undertaking street protests. For many, this was the first time they were engaged without a male chaperone as in many cases, they were working on behalf of imprisoned male relatives. Some women were killed in the conflict. Aida Lafuente was active on the front, and died during the Asturian conflict. A number of women played important organizational roles behind the scenes. They included Dolores Ib√°rruri, Isabel de Albacete and Alicia Garc√≠a. They were aided by the PCE's Committee to Aid Workers' Children. More recently, academics have been discussing whether the Asturian miners's strike represented the real start of the Spanish Civil War. Imagery from the conflict was subsequently used by both sides for propaganda to further their own agenda, particularly inside PSOE who saw the situation as a call for political unity on the left if they were to have any hope of countering what they viewed as the rise of fascism. PSOE consequently used gendered imagery to sell their ideas. Propaganda used the events of October 1934 to feature women in gender- conforming ways that did not challenge their roles as feminine. This was done by the male leadership with the intention of counteracting the image of strong female political leaders, who unnerved many on the right. Right-wing propaganda at the time featured women as vicious killers, who defied gender norms to eliminate the idea of Spanish motherhood.  Start of the Civil War  Location of Melilla, where Nationalist forces started their campaign in 1936. On 17 July 1936, the Uni√≥n Militar Espa√±ola launched a coup d'√©tat in North Africa and Spain. They believed they would have an easy victory. They failed to predict the people's attachment to the Second Republic. With the Republic largely maintaining control over its Navy, Franco and others in the military successfully convinced Adolf Hitler to provide transport for Spanish troops from North Africa to the Iberian peninsula. These actions led to a divided Spain, and the protracted events of the Spanish Civil War. It would not officially end until 1 April 1939. Franco's initial coalition included monarchists, conservative Republicans, Falange Espa√±ola members, Carlist traditionalist, Roman Catholic clergy and the Spanish army. They had support from fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The Republican side included Socialists, Communists, and various other left-wing actors. The military revolt was announced on the radio across the country, and people took to the streets immediately as they tried to determine the extent of the situation, and whether it was a military or political conflict. Ib√°rruri coined the phrase \\"¬°No pasar√°n!\\" a few days later, on 18 July 1936 in Madrid while broadcasting from the Ministry of the Interior's radio station, saying, \\"It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. ¬°No pasar√°n!\\" At the start of the Civil War, there were two primary anarchist organizations: Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI). Representing working-class people, they set out to prevent the Nationalists from seizing control while also serving as reforming influences inside Spain. Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed the Non- Intervention Treaty in August 1936, promising not to provide material support for the war to any of the parties, even as Germany and Italy were already providing support to the rebel faction.  Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939)  In the Civil War period, mainstream leftist feminism often took on an individualistic approach to addressing inequalities. There were often battles over the issue, whether the personal should be political and vice versa. A few groups challenged the mainstream Western feminism of the period, including Mujeres Libres. While deliberately rejecting the label of feminism, the group's version of feminism was about creating leadership structures that incorporated everyone, instead of having a feminist leadership model that paralleled patriarchal ones. Many feminists disliked the organization, as it was an affiliated with the CNT, where women were often locked out of leadership positions and instead encouraged to join the women's auxiliary organization. Others disliked Mujeres Libres' decision to downplay the role of specific female leaders, and instead make all feminist actions appear to be the result of collectivist action.  Women's rights  During the Second Republic and during the initial stages of the Civil War, there was a social and economic revolution in women's rights, especially in areas like Catalonia. Because of the nature of war, many reforms were sporadically and inconsistently implemented, and advances made during the latter half of 1936 were largely erased by May 1937. On 25 December 1936, the Generalitat de Catalu√±a made abortion legal for the first time in the history of Spain following a decree from the Health Department. The anarchist-dominated Health Department then followed this up in March 1937 with regulations for hospitals and clinics about how to conduct abortions. The same government also for the first time provided government-sponsored information and access to birth control, coupling it with information and treatment for venereal disease. Women's liberation failed on the Republican side by the close of the Civil War. The lack of implementing full liberation during the peaceful period of the Second Republic was a leading cause, as sexist thinking that existed on that side had continued to exist and was reinforced as the war progressed.  Gender roles  The Spanish Civil War served to break traditional gender roles on the Republican side. It allowed women to fight openly on the battlefield, a rare occurrence in twentieth century European warfare. The war also served to remove the influence of the Catholic Church in defining gender roles on the Republican side. While the war broke down gender norms, it did not create progress on equitable employment or remove domestic tasks as the primary role of women. Behind the scenes, away from the front, women serving in personal family and Republican opposition support roles were still expected to cook for soldiers, launder their uniforms, look after children and tend to dwellings. Women supporting CNT militants were relieved of these gender roles but were still expected to serve male fighters in the traditional way.  Political parties and political activity  During the Spanish Civil War, various political and government forces on the Republican side tried to encourage women's participation. Only one group acted overtly on feminist goals, namely Mujeres Libres. For the remaining political parties, labor groups and government organizations, women's rights and feminist goals were not among their top concerns. Working-class girls involved with both anarchists and socialists often chastized women from other villages who came from different left-wing political parties. There was a lack of solidarity. Pilar Vivancos explained this as a result of a lack of education among women, with patriarchy within parties being used to set women against each other instead of collectively working towards emancipation of women. They did not understand what it truly meant, and it made them vulnerable to political puritanism that would later sweep through the left.  Anti-Fascists  Anti-fascist organizations often attracted a heterogeneous membership. This at times could lead to major differences, discrepancies and priorities when it came to implementing anti-fascist programs. Different groups including socialists, communists and anarchists would sometimes try to take advantage of this inside these organizations. POUM was the dissident communist party during this period. It tried to encourage women to join specifically female sub- organizations. While the Agrupaci√≥n de Mujeres Antifascistas (AMA) represented women from a wide variety of anti-fascist political backgrounds, it ended up serving as a vehicle of communist orthodoxy designed to mobilize women to support the Communist cause on the Republican side of the civil war. Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista had women both in high level leadership positions and in leadership spots further down the hierarchy. In contrast, Mujeres Libres was a CNT auxiliary, and the women were often denied a specific spot at the table as there was a view among anarchist leaders that adults, not women, should be the ones to make decisions. Anarchists often were unwilling to give support to women combating gender-based problems at this time. There were always questions of whether women should be fully integrated or should work in women-only groups to achieve specific aims. This resulted in making the movement less effective in accomplishing goals related to women.The first edition of Mujeres Libres, a magazine published by the organization of the same name ;Mujeres Libres Mujeres Libres became one of the most important women's anarchist organizations during the Civil War. Their Civil War ranks were aided by women moving over from the CNT to participate in the organization. The organization's importance was a result of their different These included running educational programs, and trying to increase women's literacy. They also organized collective kitchens, parent-controlled daycare centers, and provided prenatal and infant health information to expecting parents. One of their more significant struggles during the Civil War was centered on fighting prostitution. Education was viewed a key aspect here, as it was believed educated women would be less likely to turn to prostitution. There were over 20,000 members by 1938. Mujeres Libres also published a journal of the same name. Articles focused on personal autonomy, the creation of female identities, and self-esteem. It also often addressed the conflicts in identity between being a woman and being a mother, and how women should navigate their identities as maternal figures. The October 1938 CNT congress in Barcelona did not welcome Mujeres Libres, barring entry to a delegation of 15 women. Women had previously been allowed to attend, but only as representatives of other, mixed gendered anarchist organizations. A women's only organization was not tolerated. The women protested but did not get an explanation until an extraordinary meeting of the CNT on 11 February 1939. When the response came, it was that \\"an independent women's organization would undermine the overall strength of the libertarian movement and inject an element of disunity that would have negative consequences for the development of working-class interests and the libertarian movement on the whole.\\" Foreign anarchists found organizations like Mujeres Libres baffling, as discussions around women's rights by Spanish anarchist women were often based around expanding rights while at the same time maintaining traditional gender roles. Older members were often critical of younger ones, viewing them as being too hesitant to act and considering them obsessed with sexuality, birth control and access to abortions. Mujeres Libres folded before the end of the Civil War.  Communists  While other communist organizations existed, Partido Comunista de Espa√±a (PCE) remained the dominant one. In the first year of the Civil War, the PCE rapidly increased membership almost three-fold. Among the peasantry, women represented nearly a third of its members. During the Civil War, Ib√°rruri earned herself the nickname of La Pasionaria as she traveled around the country to speak in opposition to the Francoist forces. She used radio to disseminate her message, gaining fame by calling men and women to arms with her \\"¬°No pasar√°n!\\" Another of her famous sayings during the Civil War was: \\"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.\\" The Communist Party did not approve of her private life, telling her to end her relationship with a male party member who was 17 years her younger. She complied.  Socialists  During the Civil War, socialist groups still tended to lack female participation as a result of the same broader pre-war problems that continued to exist. When socialist women wanted to get involved, they either had to do so through socialist youth organizations or they had to switch allegiances to the communists, who accepted women more readily and were more likely to put them into leadership positions. Abroad, socialist women were more active in their opposition to the Spanish Civil War. Belgian women socialists were opposed to their socialist party's neutrality during the Civil War. To counter this, these women socialists were active in trying to evacuate refugees. They managed to send 450 Basque children to Belgium in March 1937. With the assistance of the Belgian Red Cross and Communist's Red Aid, socialist women organized the placement of 4,000 Spanish refugees. PSOE continued to ignore the unique problems of women during the Civil War. When women were interested in joining the party, they found they could not be promoted to leadership positions. PSOE also refused to send women to the front, perpetuating the sexist belief that a women could best serve the war effort by staying at home. One of the few publicly socialist identified militia women in this period was Mar√≠a Elisa Garc√≠a, who served as a miliciana with the Popular Militias as a member Asturias Battalion Somoza company.  Women's media and writing  The Spanish Civil War inspired many works of fiction and non-fiction, written by Spanish and international writers. As a result, it would later be labeled the \\"Poet's War\\". While there would be many literary compilations and literary analyses of these works during and following the war, few if any touched on the work produced by women writers in this period. As the Civil War progressed, more anti-fascist organizations began publishing magazines and newspapers for women, specifically addressing their needs. This had a flow-on effect of increasing women's personal agency. Mujeres Libres published a journal of the same name. Its articles focused on personal autonomy, the creation of female identities, and self-esteem. The militia women or milicianas on the front often wrote about their experiences for publication in party-supported media. One of their favorite topics was inequality on the front, and the hope that in addition to combat, they would also take on support roles like tending to the injured, cooking and cleaning while male colleagues were afforded time to rest.  Francoist Spain (1938 - 1973)  Mainstream feminism largely disappeared from public discourse, replaced by an oppressive form of state-sponsored feminism that was no more than support for Spain's traditional gender roles denying women personal and political autonomy. Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange tried to depict feminism as a form of depravity, associating it with drug abuse and other evils plaguing society. State-supported feminism, expressed through Secci√≥n Femenina, presented Isabel the Catholic and Teresa of Avila as symbols of inspiration for Spanish women. They had first been used by Francoist women during the Civil War, and reminded women that their role was to become mothers and to engage in pious domesticity.  Gender roles  The end of the Civil War, and the victory of fascist forces, saw the return of traditional gender roles in Spain. They included the unacceptability of women serving in combat roles in the military. Where gender roles were more flexible, it was often around employment issues where women felt an economic necessity to make their voices heard. It was also more acceptable for women to work outside the home, though the options were still limited to roles defined as more traditionally female, such as working as nurses, or in soup kitchens or orphanages. Overall though, the end of the Civil War proved a double loss for Republican women, as it first took away their limited political power and the identities as women that they had won during the Second Republic and secondly, it forced them back into the confines of their homes. With strict gender norms back in place, women who had found acceptable employment before and during the Civil War found employment opportunities even more difficult in the post-war period. Teachers who had worked for Republican schools were often unable to find employment. Gender norms were further reinforced by Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange. Opportunities to work, study or travel required taking classes on cooking, sewing, childcare and the role of women before they were granted. If women did not attend these classes, they were denied these opportunities.  Women's rights  The pillars for a New Spain in the Franco era became national syndicalism and national Catholicism. Following the Civil War, the legal status for women in many cases reverted to the terms of the Napoleonic Code that had first been incorporated into Spanish law in 1889. The post Civil War period saw the return of laws that effectively made wards of women. They were dependent on husbands, fathers and brothers if they wished to work outside the home. It was not until later labor shortages that laws around employment opportunities for women changed. The laws adopted in 1958 and 1961 provided a very narrow opportunity for women to be engaged in non-domestic labor outside the household. In March 1938, Franco suppressed the laws regarding civil matrimony and divorce that had been enacted by the Second Republic. The 1954 Ley de Vagos y Maleante saw further repression directed towards women, specifically those who were lesbians. The law saw many lesbians committed, put into psychiatric institutions and given electroshock treatment. The Franco period saw an extreme regression in the rights of women. The situation for women was more regressive than that of women in Nazi Germany under Hitler. Women needed permission for involvement in a variety of basic activities, including applying for a job, opening a bank account or going on a trip. Legislation during the Franco period allowed husbands to kill their wives if they caught them in the act of adultery.  Political organizations and activists  Mainstream feminism in Spain went underground and became clandestine in the post-Civil War period in response to the crackdown instituted by Francoist Spain. Partido Comunista de Espa√±a became the dominant clandestine political organization in Spain following the end of the Civil War and continued to be involved in feminist activities. It retained this position until it was replaced by the PSOE after Franco's death. Women were involved with the party, helping to organize covert armed resistance by serving in leadership roles and assisting in linking up political leaders in exile with those active on the ground in Spain.  Women's media and writing  Margarita Nelken, Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Sierra and Carmen de Burgos had all been pre- Civil War feminist writers. Following the war, their work was subjected to strict censorship. Spanish feminists in Spain in the post Civil War period often needed to seek exile in order to remain active. Works produced by these writers included Nada by Carmen Laforet in 1945 and La mujer nueva in 1955, Primera memoria by Ana Mar√≠a Matute in 1960. Writings of some foreign feminists also found their way to Spain, including the Le deuxi√®me sex published in French in 1947 by Simone de Beauvoir. Inside Spain, well connected, often aristocratic Spanish feminists were sometimes able to publish their works for domestic consumption by 1948. These included works by Mar√≠a Lafitte, Countess of Campo Alanaga, and Lil√≠ √Ålvarez. Works by Republican pre- war feminists like Rosa Chacel and Mar√≠a Zambrano, who continued to write from exile, also saw their works smuggled into Spain.  Addendum  The valuable contributions by Spanish women and feminists fighting on the Republican side have been under reported, and women's own stories have frequently been ignored. One of the major reasons for this was the sexism that existed at the time. Women and the problems of women were just not considered important, especially by the Francoist victors. When women's involvement in the Civil War was discussed, it was treated as a bunch of stories not relative to the overarching narratives of the war or a broader feminist movement. At the same time, because Nationalist forces won the war, they wrote the history that followed. As they represented a return to traditional gender norms, they had less reason than Republican forces to discuss the importance of feminists and women's involvement on the losing side of the war.

They came from a culture with iconic fighters, and where women had been recently empowered through direct political engagement in political organizations and labor unions. The Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera saw women take more to the streets to protest and riot, though their actions were dismissed by male political leaders. The creation of the Second Spanish Republic led to an environment encouraging active political participation in broader Spanish society, and ultimately served to assist many women in their decision to head to the front, as the Government expanded rights for women, including the right to vote, divorce, go to school and stand for election. The Asturian miners' strike of 1934, three years into the Republic's history, saw women mobilized on a battlefront where they defended the rights of striking miners. This created paranoia on the right that women would take up arms and dispense with male leadership. Two years later, the Spanish Civil War started in Melilla and soon expanded nationwide. Women rose up to defend the Republic, playing a critical role in making the war a protracted affair. The start of the Civil War saw women mobilized in militias affiliated with unions and political organizations, with over 1,000 women joining up in the opening months to serve on the front lines of the Republican side. Unlike men, women actively sought out this choice. Communists and anarchists would make up the bulk of women on the front. Women also came from abroad to fight in the International Brigades. On the front, women served alongside men in mostly mixed-gendered battalions, and were transferred around Spain. Despite a desire for combat, some of those in male leadership positions made them serve in support roles. Women were killed and injured on the front. The first Spanish Republican woman to die on the battlefield was Lina √ìdena on 13 September 1936. They were on the front from July 1936 to March 1937, when they were officially demobilized. This decision was made by male political and military leaders, who were threatened by their presence. The decision was opposed by the women themselves. The valuable contributions of Republican women fighters has been under reported, and women's own stories have frequently been ignored. This was a result of sexism, women fearing torture and death, and lack of primary sources.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800 - 1922)  Malasa√±a y su hija by left While women had been sporadically involved in combat in Spain, no large organized force of female fighters () had been mobilized in the prelude to the Second Republic. Notable women who had participated in the past included Napoleon resistance fighter Agustina de Arag√≥n, Manuela Malasa√±a and Clara del Rey during the Peninsular War. During the Peninsular War, a writer for the La Gaceta de Madrid would ask why the city's women fighters exceeded their men in courage. Despite their status as national icons, these women were the exception to the rule about women's roles in war in this period. Still, this period would start to set the stage for women's later involvement. Women continued to be locked out politically, and created auxiliary organizations to male dominated ones in order to be politically engaged in ideologies like socialism and anarchism. Depending on the level of acceptance from these groups and unions, women moderated their voices accordingly. As a consequence, when the Civil War came, anarchist women headed to the front lines in greater numbers than socialist women, as their political involvement was greater and more direct.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)  When political activity occurred by women during the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, it was often spontaneous. Despite an increasing presence on the streets, women were often ignored by left-wing male political leaders who purported to support their cause. Despite this, women were increasingly involved in riots and protests, representing increased political awareness of their need to be more active in social and political spheres to enact change to improve their lives. Their participation politically though did not yet involve taking up arms against or in support of the government. The abdication of Spain's king in 1930 would spell the end of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, and usher in the era of the Second Republic.  Second Spanish Republic (1931 - 1937)  The rights women attained under the constitution of the Second Republic played a role in encouraging active participation in broader Spanish society, and ultimately served to assist many women in their decision later to head to the front. The rights included in the constitution included universal suffrage, the ability to run for office, employment in government offices without regards to gender during the hiring process, access to unified education across all levels, and divorce. The first elections in the Second Republic saw three women elected to office, before women had achieved the right to vote. The Second Republic also heralded in a period of the creation of numerous women's political organizations across the political spectrum all around Spain. Committee of Women against War and Fascism () was created in 1933, with support from Partido Comunista de Espa√±a (PCE) and Dolores Ib√°rruri acting as its major driver. It soon attracted women from across the political spectrum. Existing tensions within the anarchist movement, as a result of deliberate exclusion or discouragement by male leadership, eventually led to the creation of Mujeres Libres by Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n in May 1936, shortly before the start of the Civil War. Initially based in Madrid and Barcelona, the organization had the purpose of seeking emancipation for women. Their goals also included \\"to combat the triple enslavement to which (women) have been subject: enslavement to ignorance, enslavement as women and enslavement as workers\\". Anarchists activity during the Second Republic, including classes on ideology, would be the roots from which many militia women () emerged.  October Revolution of 1934  Asturias, Spain. Women played roles behind the scenes in one of the first major conflicts of the Second Republic, when workers' militias seized control of the mines in Asturias. Originally planned as a nationwide strike, the workers collective action only really took place in Asturias. Some women were involved in propaganda others in assisting the miners, and some in active combat confrontation. After the government quelled the insurrection by bringing in Moroccan legionaries, some 30,000 people found themselves in prison and another 1,000 were put into graves. A large number of those put into prison were women. During fighting in Oviedo, women were on the battlefield serving in a variety of roles. At least one attended to the wounded while shelling went on around her. Others took up arms. Still more went from leftist position to leftist position with active shelling happening, providing fighters with food and motivational speeches. A√≠da Lafuente was among the Spanish women who took part in militant labor action in October 1934 in Asturias. The Asturian conflict saw few instances of women initiated violence. This fed into paranoia among those on the right that women would violently try to seize power from men. Both on the left and the right, people viewed these women as heroic, and men wanted to limit their potential for further political action. Women were also involved in building barricades, clothing repair, and street protests. For many women, this was the first time they were civically engaged without a male chaperone as in many cases these women were working on behalf of imprisoned male relatives. Women were also killed in this conflict. A√≠da Lafuente was active on the front, and died during the Asturian conflict. The actions of women attached to Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres contra la Guerra y el Fascismo in the event led to the organization being declared illegal later in the year. To get around this, the women re- organized as Organizaci√≥n Pro Infancia Obrera. More recently, academics have debated if the Asturian miners' strike represented the real start of the Spanish Civil War. Imagery from the conflict was subsequently used by both sides for propaganda to further their own agenda, particularly inside PSOE who saw it the situation as a call for political unity on the left if they were to have any hope of countering the rise of fascism in Spain. PSOE consequently used a lot of gendered imagery to sell people on their ideas. Propaganda used featuring the events in October 1934 featured women in gender conforming ways that did not challenge their roles as feminine. This was done by male leadership with the intention of counteracting the image of strong women political leaders, who unnerved many on the right. Right wing propaganda at the time featured women as vicious killers, who defied gender norms to eliminate the idea of Spanish motherhood.  Start of the Civil War  Location of Melilla, where Nationalist forces started their campaign in 1936. On 17 July 1936, the Uni√≥n Militar Espa√±ola launched a coup d'√©tat in North Africa and Spain. They believed they would have an easy victory. They failed to predict the people's attachment to the Second Republic. With the Republic largely maintaining control over its Navy, Franco and others in the military successfully convinced Adolf Hitler to provide transport for Spanish troops from North Africa to the Iberian peninsula. These actions led to a divided Spain, and the protracted events of the Spanish Civil War. It would not officially end until 1 April 1939. Franco's initial coalition included monarchists, conservative Republicans, Falange Espa√±ola members, Carlist traditionalist, Roman Catholic clergy and the Spanish army. They had support from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The Republican side included Socialists, Communists, and various other left wing actors. The military revolt was announced on the radio across the country, and people took to the streets immediately as they tried to determine the extent of the situation, and if it was a military or political conflict. Dolores Ib√°rruri would soon coin the phrase \\"¬°No pasar√°n!\\" a few days later, on 18 July 1936 in Madrid while on the radio from the Ministry of the Interior's radio station, saying, \\"It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. ¬°No pasar√°n!\\" At the start of the Civil War, there were two primary anarchist organizations: Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI). Representing working-class people, they set out to prevent the Nationalists from seizing control while also serving as reforming influences inside Spain. Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed the Non- Intervention Treaty in August 1936, promising not to provide material support for the war to any of the parties, even as Germany and Italy were already and continued to provide support to the Nationalist faction.  Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939)   Background  Because of changes in society, women who wanted to be involved in the war against the Rebel forces had two options: they could fight on the front lines or they could serve in auxiliary roles away from the front. Their options were not limited, like that of many women near the battlefields of World War I, where the only available role was that of auxiliary role to support men on the front. Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres contra la Guerra y el Fascismo underwent a second name change in 1936, shortly after the start of the Civil War. Their new name was Agrupaci√≥n de Mujeres Antifascistas. From there, the group would play a prominent role in sending and supporting women on the front lines in the war. At the same time that the new Agrupaci√≥n de Mujeres Antifascistas was readying for war, many women's organizations on both the right and the left were shutting down.  Mobilization  The Spanish Civil War started on 17 July 1936 with a coup d'√©tat. The military revolt that started the civil war did not immediately succeed in part because of women who took part in spontaneous uprisings. defend the home front. One of the most important mass mobilizations of women in Spain's history was their participation on the anti-Nationalist front. Shortly after the start of the Civil War, around 1,000 Spanish women volunteered to serve on the front lines of the Republican side. One of the cities that saw the greatest number of armed women rise to its defense was Madrid. This quick mobilization of women was part of the reason that the Nationalists did not gain a quick victory, and the war became a more protracted affair. Most of the militias that were created during the immediate outbreak of the Civil War came from civil society groups like trade unions and political parties. CNT, UGT and other unions stepped in to provide logistical support for many of these militias. The number of women mobilized was never high. Most joined in order to further support political ideologies they supported. Most came from militant libertarian organizations like CNT, FAI and FIJL. These militias often lacked the typical military structure in order to better represent their ideologies and better mobilize local populations. Women were not actively recruited to serve in militias. Rather, they actively sought out places to enlist. Unlike men, women had the choice to fight and made that choice. Their efforts were often difficult, as many militias rejected them on basis of their gender, and they were constantly asked to prove themselves more than men on front. Other women called them to the front, including Dolores Ib√°rruri. In the last days of Republican control of Madrid, she implored both men and women to take to arms against Nationalist forces in the city. The numbers of women mobilized and armed behind the front in support of cities exceeded the numbers who were on the front line. At most, probably 1,000 women fought on the front lines, while several thousand served in city defense. The latter included a women's only battalion that served in Madrid. Communists and anarchists columns attracted the most women among all the political groups on the Republican front. POUM attracted women fighters, but in smaller numbers. Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol (PSOE) was one of the only major actors on the left to immediately reject the idea of women participating in combat. The idea was too radical for them, and they believed women should serve as heroes at home, providing support to civilian populations well behind the front lines. Women who were members of PSOE who found their way to combat did so by joining communist and socialist youth groups. Women also came from abroad to fight as part of the International Brigades, with their total numbers documented at between 400 and 700 women. Many women first traveled to Paris, before going by boat or train to fight. They came from countries like the United States, Poland, France, Russia, Switzerland, England, Norway and Germany.Alba, V√≠ctor & Stephen Schwartz, Spanish Marxism vs Soviet Communism: A History of the P.O.U.M, Transaction Publishers, 1988, p.124Levin, Immanuil (1986). Zapiski voyennogo perevodchika: yazyk i \\"yazyki\\". Moscow: Moskovsky rabochy. pp. 49-51. A 1937 agreement designed to stop foreign intervention eventually largely put a stop to recruitment to the International Brigades for both men and women. While the national branches of Communist Party supported sending foreign fighters to Spain to fight in the Civil War in the International Brigades, they often opposed their female members from going. When they sometimes agreed to send determined women to Spain, it was often in support roles as reporters or propagandists. The party apparatus in Spain then actively worked to keep women away from the front. The first Spanish Republican women to die on the battlefield was Almeria born JSU affiliated miliciana Lina √ìdena on 13 September 1936. With Nationalist forces overrunning her position, the unit commander chose to commit suicide rather than to surrender at a battle in Guadix. Her death would be widely shared by both Republican and Falangist propagandists. With Nationalist forces threatening her with the potential of being raped by Moorish soldiers if she is does not surrender, Republicans were able to cast her as an innocent who chose death rather than to be debased and lose her honor. Falangist propaganda said there was never there and there was never a threat of rape. This made √ìdena's death meaningless. Beyond that, Falangist propaganda implied √ìdena had been guilty of murdering a Catholic priest a few weeks prior, with her suicide was a way of escaping punishment.  On the front  Milicianas with their weapons during the Spanish Civil War. On the front, the norm was for women to serve in mixed gender battalion units. They were transferred around Spain, depending on military needs for troop reinforcements. Rearguard miliciana groups were more likely to be organized into women only battalions, and were more likely to be based in the same location as part of defensive units. As a consequence, the roles played by each tended to be different. Women on the front often were faced with a duel burden of being expected to fight and to provide auxiliary support. Male leadership decisions to require this reinforced sexism inside the Republic, by allowing women to break free of gender norms by serving in combat but at the same time forcing them to engage in traditionally gendered tasks. Despite this, they were recognized by their peers for their bravery. Most women on the front served in militias aligned with some political group. A very small number served as members of the regular Republican army. Members included Esperanza Rodr√≠guez. In the first few months of the war, the Fifth Regiment had the largest contingent of milicianas among all militias. Most of the women serving in front line roles had their positions defined by the communist, anarchist or POUM leadership. Most of these gave women equal roles when it came to combat, and providing the same military contribution. In comparison to men, women on the front were often more expected to take care of injured comrades. This sometimes put them in more harms way, as some women militia members were shot while tending to injured comrades in battle. Women who had to deal with this situation included Josefa Rionda. Captains might also divert women on the battlefield to hospitals, where they expected them to work alongside nurses. In some cases, milicianas were told by column leaders that they were only allowed to remain on the front in support roles for men, by doing working as nurses or teaching largely illiterate militiamen to read. A number of these women left those columns, seeking other units where they could serve in combat. Among the women serving in the international brigades, most worked as nurses, pharmacists or doctors. Some Jewish, Polish and American women did go to Spain, and did serve in combat. They were actively discouraged from doing so by anarchists, and outright banned from doing so by communists. Combat experience did not significantly differ based on the political affiliation of the battalion that women in combat were attached to. Women proved versatile on the front, able to serve in many different combat roles. Women in rearguard battalions often met daily to practice weapons training, marching and drilling. Many also received specialized training in the use of machine guns. POUM was the only organization that had accepted women and provided them with weapons training. The lack of weapons training by women in other militias would later be used as a reason to try to remove them from the front, even as those militias also failed to prove their male recruits with weapons training. Milicianas also came from all over Spain, including Madrid, Majorca, Catalonia and Asturias. One miliciana served as captain of the artillery company of the Second Asturias Battalion.An armed Republican miliciana in 1936 in a photo by Gerda Taro. These women also came from across the leftist political spectrum. One of the few publicly socialist identified militia women in this period was Mar√≠a Elisa Garc√≠a, who served as a miliciana with the Popular Militias as a member Asturias Battalion Somoza company. Women were injured on the front. Julia Manzanal was a miliciana who found herself pregnant on the front as a result of her relationship with her boyfriend. She found a midwife, had an abortion in the morning and was back to fighting on the front in afternoon. As a consequence of the abortion, she bled for over a month while in combat. While on the front, Rosario S√°nchez had an accident involving an explosive made from a condensed milk jug that led to the amputation of her hand. She almost bled out as a consequence of her wounds, but survived only to later be captured and sent to prison. Steel Battalion Jacinta P√©rez was mortally wounded by urged her comrades ahead towards the enemy they were facing. Women in the Pasionaria Column of the Fifth Regiment of the Popular Militias often tried to transfer out. This was in part because column leaders often tried to keep women out of combat, and instead have them work in support roles for the column that included cook, and cleaning clothes and dishes. Captains in the Column often tried to force women assigned to the Column out. Some women in the milicianas cut their hair in case of capture. They did not want their heads shaved except for tufts that would then have Nationalist ribbons put in them and then being paraded around a town near where they were captured. Nationalists would frequently execute prisoners of war that had been transported to prison. This included executing pregnant milicianas captured in combat. The threat of rape of female combatants was one used regularly by Nationalist forces to discourage their involvement. It was a very real threat as it happened as a regular feature for both combatant and non-combatant women, with Moorish soldiers being used in some cases to further the debasement of these women soldiers among their battalions and in the wider population. It also served Nationalist forces to remind all women that they were inferior to men, and that men would easily conquer them. Consequently, when women died on the front, their deaths were often treated not as deaths towards a higher purpose, but a personal loss of honor resulting in death. Female fighters caught on the front and given death sentences were often raped before being shot. Franco's treatment of Republican women fighters caught on the front line at times shocked his German allies. He could and did order their execution, and then return to eating breakfast as if nothing special had occurred. In the last half of 1936, milicianas were not considered exceptional by many of their male colleagues; they served as comrades alongside men in separate or mixed gender battalions. This was in large part because many of the milicianas were motivated to fight because their own revolutionary beliefs: they believed their involvement could change the course of the war, and bring about a new revolution in thinking in society. A few women fought because they were following husbands, fathers or sons into battle. This group though represented a very small minority, with the majority fighting for ideological reasons. Because women were viewed by some as unnatural participants in battle, women were often suspected of espionage or seeking to betray Republican ideals. They began to become suspect on the battlefield. This paranoia would later play a role in removing women from the front. Milicianas were also suspected of passing along sexually transmitted diseases to men, which resulted in male fighters dying from syphilis. This was perceived as viewing bringing militias into disrepute and harming male readiness for combat. Military and political leaders also slandered milicianas, accusing them of being prostitutes and nymphomaniacs, representing a greater threat to the loyalist forces than the rebel forces they were facing in battle because they spread venereal disease.Mika Etcheb√©rh√®re in Ma guerre d'Espagne √† moi published in Paris in 1976 contends that some women were straight up prostitutes, encouraged to the front by the presence of single men who had money.Mar√≠a de la Luz Mej√≠as Correa in As√≠ fue pasando el tiempo. Memorias de una miliciana extreme√±a published in 2006 in Seville said that despite going to the front to accompany her husband, local women in the area still called her (incorrectly) a prostitute and a slut. These local women also accused milicianas of spreading venereal disease. While there were some brothels near the front, they were not run by milicianas and de la Luz Mej√≠as Correa contends that men who went to brothels were never accused of spreading venereal disease. Clara Campoamor would be among a number of voices urging women off the front, accusing women of being prostitutes. When this was shared among milicianas, it made some of their blood boil, as it demonstrated to them that the left was no better than the right when it came to protecting women's rights. Such rationales, along with lack of weapons training, were used to make an argument that women should be removed from the front. Lina √ìdena, Soledad Casilda M√©ndez, A√≠da Lafuente, Rosario S√°nchez Mora, Concha Lozano and Maruja Tomico were all milicianas who would be immortalized by the Republic during this period of active women's involvement in combat.  July 1936  = Aragon Front = The Catalans had their own militia in Aragon, with a small contingent of elite women fighters. The Los Aguiluchos de Les Corts group moved from Barcelona to Caspe on the Aragon front, following their involvement in conflicts in Barcelona. Concha P√©rez Collado joined the Ortiz column while in Caspe, going with her new unit to Azaila. Soledad Casilda M√©ndez served in a militia from the Basque Country, where she was the only woman initially. Involved at the fighting during the last days on the Aragon front, she was one of only two women involved in active combat with her militia. = Barcelona Front = Uni√≥n de Muchachas battalion included two thousand women aged fourteen to twenty-five. They started training in July 1936, when the Civil War began. They were sponsored by the National Confederation for Physical Education, and came from a group of leftist sportspeople who had protested Hitler organizing the 1936 Summer Olympics, and who had organized the People's Olympics in Barcelona that year in protest. The start of the war led to the cancellation of the event, with a number of the participants enlisting in support of the Republic and being involved in the July 1936 defense of Barcelona. This included English woman Felicia Browne. Upon enlisting, she was quoted as saying, \\"I am a member of the London Communists and I can fight as well as any man\\". Switzerland's Clara Thalmann was another woman who joined a Republican militia after the cancellation of the Games, volunteering in the Durruti Column. Concha P√©rez Collado was part of Los Aguiluchos de Les Corts, a group of 100 armed soldiers from her Barcelona neighborhood, who joined shortly after the outbreak of the war. Only seven members of the group were women. Shortly after the start of the Civil War, P√©rez Collado was part of a group that attacked the Model Prison with a goal of freeing political prisoners housed inside. Later, she was part of a group that took control of a convent. She also assisted in creating barricades in her Barcelona neighborhood. Along with other anarchists, she rode in the back of a pickup truck covered by a mattress and with four guns between them. They went to the Pedralbes Barracks, engaged in fighting there and managed to gain a small cache of weapons. Following this, her group went to Caspe on the Aragon front. Marina Ginest√† i Coloma was another woman on the front in Madrid in July 1937. Originally from France and a member of the Unified Socialist Youth, she joined the war as a reporter when she was only 17 years old. Ginest√† i Coloma, working with Mikhail Koltsov, served as a photographer and translator for the Soviet newspaper Pravda. A famous photograph of her at the original Hotel Col√≥n was taken on 21 July 1936. A non-combatant, it was the only time during the war when she handled a weapon. Lois Orr served in Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) female militia in Barcelona in the early part of the war.Lois Orr, Letters from Barcelona: An American Woman in Revolution and Civil War, edited by Gerd- Rainer Horn, , 2009Jeremy Harding, Paralysed by the Absence of Danger, London Review of Books, 31(18), 2009 = Siege of Cuartel de la Monta√±a = Volunteered of Milicias Populares at Cuartel General \\"Fernando Cond√©s\\" during the first days of the war. Women's only battalions existed behind the front lines as rearguard support in defense of their cities. Barcelona had such a battalion organized by PSUC. In Mallorca, there was the Rosa Luxemburg Battalion , and in Madrid there was the Uni√≥n de Muchachas. In the first days of the war, Trinidad Revolt√≥ Cervell√≥ was involved in front line combat at the Military Headquarters and at the Atarazanas Barracks in Barcelona. Pepita Laguarda Batet was also among the women who were involved in July confrontations. Women were involved in the Monta√±a Barracks attack. Angelina Mart√≠nez was among them. Originally from Madrid, she was a member of Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas. She continued fighting even after most of the men in her unit were killed. Her actions were featured later that month in the newspaper Estampa. = Madrid Front = POUM initially required both men and women in combat to also engage in support roles as needed. Women were in the trenches and stood guard. Captain Fernando Saavedra of the Sargento V√°zquez Battalion said these women fought just like men. Fidela Fern√°ndez de Velasco P√©rez had been trained in the use of arms before the start of the war, and served on the front lines right away outside Madrid. She captured a cannon from the Nationalists, before being transferred to the Toledo front. Her new unit was the same one which Rosario S√°nchez de la Mora was serving. There, Fern√°ndez de Velasco P√©rez fought on the front and sought action by going behind enemy lines to sabotage them alongside other shock troops. She learned how to construct bombs. Rosario S√°nchez Mora was one of the first women to join the militias in defense of Madrid following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, enlisting as a 17-year-old on 17 July 1936. Te√≥fila Madro√±al was another Spanish woman who served on the front lines. She enlisted in Leningrad Battalion during the first days of the war, underwent weapons training and then was deployed to the Estremadura highway during the Siege of Madrid. When the war broke out, Margarita Ribalta was initially assigned by JSU to a position at headquarters. Unhappy with not being more involved, a few days later she enrolled with a Partido Comunista de Espa√±a column and was transferred to the front, where she volunteered to be part of an advance group trying to take a hill. She led her group, running between two Nationalist positions while carrying a machine gun. A Republican support plane mistook her group for Nationalists, bombing them and wounding Ribalta. Argentine born Mika Etcheb√©h√®re served in a POUM militia during the Civil War. A self-described Trotskyist, Etcheb√©h√®re moved to Madrid from Paris a few days before the outbreak of the War, enlisting immediately and then being deployed as part of the Hip√≥lito Etcheb√©h√®re column to the front near Madrid.  August 1936  Location of Mallorca, where POUM had a column that included women fighters.Women were in the rearguard in August 1936, supporting the defense of Barcelona. = Battle of Majorca = POUM had a column that included milicianas in the Mallorca campaign. Trinidad Revolt√≥ Cervell√≥ joined the Popular Militias and went to the Balaeric Islands, where she again saw front line action at Battle of Mallorca. Catalans also sent 400 fighters to the Balearic Islands front, with 30 of the fighters being milicianas. In Mallorca, there was the Rosa Luxemburg Battalion that saw action on the front in defense of the city. Women in rearguard battalions often met daily to practice weapons training, marching and drilling. Many also received specialized training in the use of machine guns. Milicianas in 1936. = Siege of Oviedo = Mar√≠a Elisa Garc√≠a fought with the Battalion at the Lugones front, and later in the Basque mountains. = Aragon Front = Felicia Browne, an English artist and communist, served in the international brigades, died on the Aragon front on 25 August 1936. She was the first British volunteer of either sex to die in combat in the war.Tom Buchanan, \\"The Lost Art of Felicia Browne\\", History Workshop Journal, Autumn 2002, (p. 180-201) She died while serving as part of a raiding party that was targeting a train filled with military munitions. The group was ambushed, with some injured. Browne was attempting to aid a wounded Italian comrade when she was shot in the head. Her body had to be left behind and it was not safe enough to retrieve it.E. Tofoni, Il lungo cammino nella Sierra, Ed. Lavoro, page 41 Clara Thalmann , part of Durruti Column, served on the Aragon Front, marching their from Barcelona where she had enlisted. Concha P√©rez Collado's unit stayed in Azaila until they mobilized for the attack on Belchite on 24 August 1936. She remained on the Aragon front for another four months, after which she departed for the Huesca. Along with her boyfriend Juan L√≥pez Carvajal, Pepita Laguarda Batet enlisted in the Ascaso Column from where they were deployed to the Aragon front shortly after. Arriving on 19 August 1936 as part of the 45 group, the couple always stayed on the front line. She told her boyfriend shortly after enlisting, ‚ÄùAt Pedralbes, in the Miguel Bakunin barracks, a column is forming to go to the Aragon front, and I have enrolled as a volunteer‚Äù. Juan replied : ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going there, I‚Äôll go with you‚Äù.  September 1936  = Aragon Front = Serving on the outskirts of Huesca, Pepita Laguarda Batet participated in fighting for several hours early on the morning of 1 September. Around 5:00 AM, she received a major wound that would kill her several hours later at 9:30 AM. After being injured, she was quickly transferred to Vici√©n hospital before again being moved to a hospital in Gra√±√©n. = Sierra Front = In September 1936, the Largo Caballero Battalion which included about ten women, fought on the Sierra front. Those in combat included Josefina Vara. = Madrid Front = By September, Mika Etcheb√©h√®re had become a commander after being promoted as a result of her own commander being killed in battle.  October 1936  = Zaragoza Front = The International Group of the Durruti Column had many women serving in it. Involved in fighting in October 1936 at Perdiguera, a group of these women died. The dead included Suzanna Girbe, Augusta Marx, Juliette Baudard, Eugenie Casteu and Georgette Kokoczinski. The next month, Suzanna Hans of the same group died at the battle of Farlete. = Siege of Sig√ºenza = Women militants and civilians were part of the group that found themselves trapped for four days at the Sig√ºenza Cathedral as a result of a Nationalist siege in October 1936. After running out of food and ammo, with the walls of the Cathedral beginning to fall from incessant cannon fire, many in the group decided to make a run for it at night. POUM Captain Mika Feldman de Etcheb√©h√®re was among those at the cathedral. She was one of the approximately one third of people who fled who survived. Her bravery during the Siege of Sig√ºenza earned her a promotion to POUM's Lenin Battalion Second Company Captain. After recovering from the siege in Barcelona, she was ordered to Moncloa, where she was in charge of a special shock troop brigade.  November 1936  = Siege of Madrid = While most battalions were mixed gendered, the Women's Battalion organized by the PCE and saw combat on the Madrid front was only women. The battalion was called Batall√≥n Femenino del 5¬∫ Regimiento de Milicias Populares. Some women who were already serving as nurses as part of the Fifth Regiment returned from the front specifically to join the women's only battalion. Battalion members would sometimes march down Gran V√≠a in Madrid in groups of two or three since shelling on the street was too heavy to allow them to march in formation. Communist women were able to achieve front line leadership roles. 22-year-old Aurora Arn√°iz commanded a JSU column during the Siege of Madrid. Julia Manzanal became the Political Commissar for the Batall√≥n Municipal de Madrid when she was only 17. From there, she armed herself with a rifle and a pistol, fighting on the front lines, serving as a guard and engaging in espionage role despite having enlisted initially with the role of educating her comrades in Communist ideology. By this time, Uni√≥n de Muchachas was a communist organized rearguard women's only battalion in Madrid that fought on the front line starting on 8 November 1936. Positioned at Segovia Bridge and near Getafe on the Carabanchel front and representing the bulk of the Republican forces in those positions, Uni√≥n de Muchachas fighters were among the last to retreat. Te√≥fila Madro√±al was deployed to the Estremadura highway during the Siege of Madrid.  December 1936  Note in memory of left During the winter of 1936, the Republican government tried to formally convert militias into units in their armed forces. Until this point, women had joined militias affiliated with various political parties and unions. = Tardienta sector = Starting in December, Concha P√©rez Collado was part of a group of milicianas that fought in the Tardienta sector. The women were eventually moved off the front by the end of the year.  January 1937  Fanny Schoonheyt in Barcelona, May 1937. = Battle of Jarama = In January 1937 at the Battle of Jarama, Republican forces were near the point of retreating until three Spanish milicianas inspired the men they were serving with to hold fast. The women, manning a machine gun post, refused to retreat.  March 1937  = Madrid Front = Salaria Kea, the only African American woman to serve in the International Brigades, joined the Abraham Lincoln Battalion in 1937. As a nurse in the American Medical Bureau, she was deployed along the Madrid front in March. where she was captured by Spanish Nationalist Army. Kea managed to escape six weeks later with assistance from International Brigade soldiers.Salaria Kea, \\"Doing Christ's Duty\\" in Jim Fyrth and Sally Alexander, Women's Voices from the Spanish Civil War. London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1991. (p. 151-4) POUM milicianas in Madrid during the siege were at prohibited from taking up arms by the Communist organized La Pasionaria column. These women were instead required to cook and do laundry for men serving on the Madrid front.  May 1937  = Vizcaya Front = Mar√≠a Elisa Garc√≠a was killed in combat in the mountains of M√∫gica on 9 May 1937. = Barcelona Front = Concha P√©rez Collado was ambushed in Barcelona and wounded while patrolling the area near Plaza de Catalunya. The metal fragment that was lodged in her leg would stay in her body for several years. = May Days = Clara Thalmann took part in the Barcelona May Days confrontation, serving with Amigos de Durruti, alongside Paul Thalmann, her future husband. While in Barcelona, she met George Orwell while serving on the barricades. A crackdown occurred as a consequence of the event, and Thalmann and her future husband went underground, but were later captured by Servicio de Informaci√≥n Militar (SIM) while trying to flee by boat from Barcelona. After several months in prison, the pair returned to Switzerland.SolFed. \\"Clara Thalmann\\", Catalyst, #1 Winter 1987. Another woman who was POUM nurse Teresa Rebull. Her involvement led to punishment, which was part of the reason she subsequently fled Spain. Lois Orr was also involved in the Barcelona May Days.  June 1937  = Huesca Offensive = Women continued to die on the front while in combat. Margaret Zimbal was shot by a sniper in Huesca while attending to an injured comrade. = May Day Fallout = The fall out from the May Days resulted in a number of milicianas in Barcelona seeking to leave the city in June and the subsequent months after some were freed from prison.V√≠ctor Alba and Stephen Schwartz, Spanish Marxism versus Soviet communism: a history of the P.O.U.M., , 1988 Andr√©s Nin and the POUM executive were arrested on 16 June 1937 as part of the fallout of the May Day events. The following day, Lois Orr and a group she was with were arrested. With assistance from the United States Consul Mahlon Perkins, her group was released on 1 July. She then left the city two days later aboard a ship bound for France.  September 1937  Antifascist International Solidarity (SIA) was founded in Spain in June 1937 by the National Confederation of Labor (CNT) with other libertarian organizations, the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) and the Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth (FIJL). French miliciana left = Republican Army Pe√±arroya and C√≥rdoba Attacks = Foreign observers covering the war often wrote about women's bravery on the front, including saying they took enemy fire better than many of the men they fought alongside. One example of such bravery happened in Cerro Muriano in September 1937, where Republican army forces from Ja√©n and Valencia fled the front while the small militia force from Alcoy, which included two women, withstood a Nationalist bombardment.  October 1937  = Northern Front = Argentina Garc√≠a was on the front in October 1937 in San Esteban de las Cruces. The communist's bravery in battle was recognized with a promotion to Captain in her Asturias Battalion.  July 1938  = Battle of the Ebro = Salaria Kea, serving as a nurse, was Abraham Lincoln Battalion during the Ebro Offensive.  Demobilization  There are conflicting accounts by historians as to when the decision was made to remove women from the front on the Republican side. One side dates the decision to late fall of 1936 as the date when Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero gave the order. Others date the order to March 1937. What is most likely is that various political and military leaders made their own decisions based on their own beliefs that led to different groups of female combatants gradually being withdrawn from the front. But whatever date ascribed, women were being encouraged to leave the front by September 1936. Guadalajara, where women were told to leave the front in March 1937.|alt= Women were told to leave the front in Guadalajara in March 1937. Following the battle, many were load into cars and taken to support positions further behind the lines. A few refused to leave, and their fate is uncertain though friends suspected most died in combat. Expelled soldiers included Leopoldine Kokes of the International Group of the Durruti Column. Some demobilized women left the front, and joined women's columns on the home front, in defense of cities like Madrid and Barcelona. When Juan Negr√≠n became the head of the Republican armed forces in May 1937, women's time in combat ended as he continued efforts to regularize Republican forces into the Republican Army. Negr√≠n also sent word out abroad that while men were still being actively recruited, organizations were banned from sending women fighters. Feminists in PSUC and POUM responded by changing their messaging, either suggesting women should be deployed on the home front or that women had a different role to play than men during times of war. The decision to remove milicianas from the front was one made largely by liberal male Republican leaders. Women on the front did not agree. They saw their removal as a backward step, a return to traditional roles that pre-dated the Second Republic. They viewed this decision as part of a larger symptom of problems for women in society, and did not want to return to the traditional gender roles from which they had used the war to escape. Neither milicianas themselves, nor the men they served with or other actors on the Republican side, launched a protest to their withdraw. The lack of support from male comrades was particularly upsetting for some women as it appeared to them as if they never bothered to try to understand their plight. Consequently, the milicianas just quietly faded away without public protest or awareness. The removal of women from the front was a continuation of Second Republic policies designed to appeal to conservatives elements within it, who wanted to make the Republic more palatable by less overtly challenging traditional Spanish beliefs about topics such as the role of women. Removing women from the front was just part of a broader late Republican role back of women's rights to appease this base that had actually served to encourage Nationalist forces and ideas in the first place, with rationals like women did not know how to use weapons and women spread venereal disease.  Media depictions  Republican militia women in training during the Spanish Civil War. Republican propaganda about women fell into several broad categories including as a symbol of the struggle, as protective women like nurses, as victims, as representatives of the Republic, as protectors of Spain's rearguard, as carriers of venereal disease, and as combatants. During the Spanish Civil War, the militia woman () served as an important figure for Republican forces in the period between July and December 1936. Both foreign and domestic media printed images of these female fighters on Spain's front lines as breaking gender norms. Initially, they presented problems for some people in Spain, as the country had very traditional ideas about gender roles. While Republicans became more accepting of them, this started to change yet again by December 1936 when the Government of the Second Republic started using the slogan, \\"Men to the Front, Women to the Home Front.\\" By March 1937, this attitude had spread to the front lines, where militia women, over their own objections, were withdrawn or placed into secondary roles. Republican forces used the presence of milicianas as adventurous and sometimes frivolous in their own propaganda. Nationalist propaganda in contract often depicted the miliciana as a prostitute. To some degree, the image in Republican propaganda was one that many milicianas identified with and were complicit in sharing as they had absorbed cultural gender norms in their youth that they continued to perpetuate. At the same time, they often created and shared narratives that highlighted their chastity during the Civil War. When interviewed by the press, many women were offended by questions about their private lives. Rosario S√°nchez Mora, La Dinamitera, reacted in anger when interviewed, saying that comparisons to prostitutes hurt her as these women were ready to die for their ideals and ready to die for those who shared in their leftist ideology. Independent Republican media often depicted milicianas not in combat, but in support roles. Many fighters were shown in photos while nursing injured in their battalions, or cooking and cleaning for them. In contrast to the Republican miliciana, Nationalist propaganda held help the image of the mujer castiza. She was modest, pure, asexual, self-sacrificing and traditional, supporting the Spanish family through work at home, She was the anti-thesis of the Republican fighter in that she was far away from the front and would never be involved in combat. Milicianas on the front often wrote about their experiences for publication in party supported media. One of the main topics they focused on was often inequality on the front, and the expectation that in addition to combat, they would also do support roles like tending to the injured, cooking and cleaning while male colleagues were afforded time to rest. Following their removal from the front, milicianas and women in general stopped featuring in Republican propaganda. Visually, they returned to their lives before the war, where their primary role was behind the scenes at home. Communists and anarchists columns attracted the most women among all the political groups on the Republican front. Stories about POUM militants became more well known as they were more likely to have published their memories or had better contacts with international media. In the end, milicianas featured in propaganda published by both sides during the Civil War often served as a symbol of a gendered cultural ideal. Their depictions were often for the male gaze on both sides of the propaganda war. The way there were often drawn as highly sexualized beings made it easy for those on both sides to dismiss them as prostitutes.  Francoist Spain (1938 - 1973)  The end of the Civil War, and the victory of Francoist Spain, saw the return of traditional gender roles to Spain. This included the unacceptability of women serving in combat roles in the military. After the war, many milicianas faced difficulties. This included the general population being subjected to a propaganda war that ridiculed their involvement in the conflict. At the same time, the new government sought them out to put them in prison or torture them. Many fighters were also illiterate, and found this to be restrict later activities. This was coupled with restrictions placed on some when in exile in France that limited their opportunities. For those who remained politically active, they had to deal with open sexism in the Communist Party and in anarchist circles. Some women's veterans of the war never retired. They instead continued active violence against the state as part of communist and anarchist cells, using terrorism like tactics. This included bombing Guardia Civil positions, robbing banks and attacking offices of Falange. Women involved with this resistance effort included Victoria Pujolar, Adelaida Abarca and Angelita Ramis. These women, and women like them, served as go betweens for exiled leaders in France and those on the ground in Spain. They worked with Communist Party leaders to plan attacks.

The valuable contributions by Spanish women fighting on the Republican side have been under reported, and women's own stories have frequently been ignored. One of the major reasons for this was the sexism that existed at the time: Women and the problems of women were just not considered important, especially by Francoist victors. When women's involvement in the Civil War was discussed, it was treated as a bunch of stories not relative to the overarching narratives of the war. At the same time, because Nationalist forces won the war, they wrote the history that followed, As they represented a return to traditional gender norms, they had even less reason than Republican forces to discuss the importance of women's involvement on the losing side of the war. Francoist propaganda actively targeted milicianas, ridiculing their involvement in the war. Many milicianas were imprisoned or tortured, even decades after the war ended. As a result, many of the women who fought during the war were forced to remain silent. The first time Spain's milicianas were discussed openly was in 1989 at a conference about the Civil War in Salamanca. Another reason the role of Spanish women on the Republican side in the Civil War has been ignored is there is a lack of primary sources. This was a result oftentimes of either fleeing government forces destroying documents or women themselves destroying documents in order to protest themselves. Concealing their own involvement in the war in many cases assisted them in saving their own lives. In other cases, battles themselves resulted in the destruction of valuable documents that discussed women's involvement on the front.

Biography Hand-Built vase by Constantinidis (1976) (YORYM-2004.1.458) Constantinidis was born in York and grew up in Sheffield where she attended Ecclesfield Grammar School between 1939 and 1945 before studying painting at Sheffield Art College until 1949. At Sheffield she was introduced to ceramics and pottery making and in 1951 became a ceramics lecturer at Chelmsford Technical College, later part of the Essex Institute of Higher Education. This position, which she held until her, early, retirement in 1989, allowed Constantinidis to experiment and develop her own style and technical abilities. In time she developed innovative methods of throwing, firing and glazing pots. In the early 1950s Constantinidis exhibited somewhat traditional examples of pottery, inspired by industrial wares and Staffordshire slipware, with the Red Rose Guild and the British Crafts Centre but in the late 1950s, influenced by the works of Lucie Rie and Hans Coper changed her style. Working at a studio she set up at Great Baddow she produced simpler designs with reduced decoration based around a few elemental shapes. She developed painstaking methods to produce work that emphasized purity and harmony of both shape and decoration. In the 1970s her pottery became sculptural and her pots were often greatly reworked by cutting and folding after being created on her potters' wheel. In the later decades of her life Constantinidis' produced tall cylinders and bowls based on simple elegant lines. In her last years she created some notable individual pots and a set of porcelain table ware. In early 2000 she suffered a stroke but was able to complete work for a solo exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in May that year. As well as the Victoria and Albert Museum, many public collections hold examples of her work including the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto. In 1978 Constantinidis won a medal of honour at the Premio Faenza international ceramics exhibition and in 1995 a touring retrospective exhibition of her work was organised by the University of Derby.

It is located on Via Tadini #40, facing the shores of Lago d'Iseo. History The Tadini Academy of Fine Arts has its roots in the interest and collections of Count Luigi Tadini of Verona (1745-1829). At the turn of the 18th-century, the count envisioned housing his collections in a proper setting. The family residence in Palazzo Barboglio facing the present Piazza Garibaldi proved too small; thus adjacent to this site, on the road linking Lovere and Bergamo, along the lake, he had his grandson, Sebastiano Salimbeni, a self-trained architect design the present palace. Work began in 1820 with the chapel, built to house the Stele Tadini (1819-1821), a work of Antonio Canova, and dedicated to his former friend, Faustino Tadini, son of the count who had died in 1799 at the age of 25. Faustino had published a book on the early work of Canova in 1796. By 1826, the Gallery building was complete. The interior decorations, both stucco and fresco, were designed and completed by Luigi Dell'Era.The scenografer Luigi Dell'Era was born in Treviglio, and is likely the grandson of the artist Giovan Battista Dell'Era. By 1828, the museum was open to the public. He intended the collections and decoration to be aids for the curriculum of the school of design. The Piano Nobile displays the collection. In addition to the paintings, the collection includes archeologic pieces collected in Naples; porcelain from both the orient (China and Japan) and Europe (Meissen, Vienna, S√®vres, Naples, and Venice).
