The course can be seen from portions of the Richter Park public course and has garnered local rumor as to its origin and ownership. Course officials do not cooperate with the press seeking information about the facility. It appears the course was established in 1964 (some sources say 1962) by Cornelius Vander Starr who had founded the company later known as AIG over forty years before. His ashes are interned on the fifteenth tee. In 2006, it was owned by Starr International, a Bermuda-based company long associated with AIG and the Starr family. It is currently controlled by Maurice Greenberg, former AIG Chief Executive Officer. Starr International also does not discuss the facility. In 2010. press reports stated the course was owned by the private Back O' Beyond Inc., based in Brewster. It appears memberships are not available to the public and the course may only be used by employees of Starr International. Some companies associated with AIG and the financial sector were able to host functions at the club in the mid-2000s. Sculptures dot the course. The course, a par 73, measures 6748 yards. Edward C. Ryder (d. 1986) and also known for nearby Richter Park Golf Course and Val Carlson are credited as its designers. Perhaps 21 foursomes play per day, although regulars on the nearby public course claim to have never seen anyone on the greens. The course includes a restaurant and full bar.

It was designed and constructed in 1771-1773 by German-Russian architect Yury Felten.  History  The tower was erected in remembrance of heroic battles of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774 by request of Catherine II. The civil works were conducted by architect I. M. Sitnikov. The powerful stone tower, in the form of a column of Tuscan order, is topped by a round arbour upon the abacus at a height of 21 metres. Views of the nearby lake and surrounding park can be observed through the arbour's Gothic lancet apertures. In the summer of 1773, artist A. Belsky painted the external walls of the tower ruins and cracks have been cut in the plastered surface to simulate natural damage. In 1784, trees were planted along the edge of the embankment upon which the tower was sited. The tower's huge stone arch at its base enhances an impression that it extends deeply into the earth. Ruin tower in 1820s A Gothic pig-iron gate can be found at one end of the embankment. It was cast on J.M.Felten's model in 1782 at the Demidovsky factory in Ekaterinburg. It is notable as one of the first architectural products to be found in Russia made of pig-iron. Restoration The first major repair of the tower was in 1883. In the Second World War, it sustained damage from shelling, causing fragmentation, hollows and cracks in the arches and eaves and major damage to the travertin. The arbour was half- destroyed. A restoration plan was formulated in 1977 but inspection and clearance work did not begin until 1986. Experts of a joint venture between \\"Lenpolproekt\\" and the \\"Lenproektrestavratsiya\\" institute carried out design work and, from 1993, the Polish firm PKZ (Workshops on Restoration of Ancient Monuments) was appointed as contractor. The restoration was completed in 2006 and the pavilion was re-opened in August 2009. Now incorporated into a museum garden, it is open to the public daily from 11 am to 5 pm.

He is currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he works under the name Trent?, and is also known for his work for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Ring of Honor (ROH) under the Beretta name. As part of Roppongi (RPG) Vice alongside Rocky Romero, Beretta is a former four-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion. He also wrestles for Pro Wrestling Guerilla (PWG) and various independent promotions. Marasciulo began his professional wrestling career at New York Wrestling Connection in 2004 before signing to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He worked in WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in drag as The Girl from Mexico. Marasciulo debuted on WWE's main roster in 2009 as Trent Barreta and was one half of the Dude Busters with Caylen Croft. After teaming with Croft, he began wrestling as a lower-card singles competitor and was released from his WWE contract in 2013. After his release from WWE, Marasciulo started wrestling in promotions including Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, under his real name), Pro Wrestling Guerilla (PWG), and Ring of Honor (ROH).  Professional wrestling career   New York Wrestling Connection (2004‚Äì2007, 2017)  Marasciulo made his professional debut for New York Wrestling Connection on July 10, 2004, under the ring name Plazma in a losing effort to Dan Barry. After wrestling primarily in singles and tag team matches, Plazma defeated Matt Maverick on January 28, 2006 to become the promotion's first ever Hi-Fi Champion, which was also the first championship of his career. On February 25, Plazma retained the title against Maverick in his first title defense. On March 18, Plazma lost the title to Mike Spinelli. Plazma would defeat Spinelli in a rematch for the title on May 20. After successfully retaining the title against the likes of Jamie Van Lemer, Spyder, Javi-Air, and Jerry Lynn throughout the next few months, Plazma lost the Hi-Fi Championship to Dickie Rodz on October 21. After two unsuccessful attempts to regain the title in February and March 2007, respectively, Plazma teamed with Maverick to defeat The Angus Brothers (Danny and Billy) and Dan Dynasty and Jamie Van Lemer in a three-way match to win the Tag Team Championship. The team would retain the title on several occasions before losing them to MEGA and Prince Nana on December 15. That same night, Plazma defeated Quiet Storm to win the NYWC Heavyweight Championship, although the title was vacated shortly afterwards due to Marasciulo announcing his signing to World Wrestling Entertainment. On May 20, 2017, Marasciulo was inducted into the NYWC Hall of Fame as Trent Barreta and competed in an 8-man tag team match at Master of the Mat.  World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE   Florida Championship Wrestling (2007‚Äì2009)  Between August 2007 and January 2008, Marasciulo had several tryout matches for WWE, using the ring name Greg Cardona. He was signed to a WWE contract and began wrestling in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the ring name Greg Jackson. His name was later changed to Trent Barreta, then tweaked to Trent Beretta. He also competed under a mask as The Girl From Mexico in an attempt to become the first Queen of FCW, but was eliminated in the second round by Angela Fong. Beretta would soon form a tag team with Caylen Croft called The Dude Busters. Together, they would defeat Tyler Reks on May 30, 2009 to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship after Reks' tag team partner, Johnny Curtis, failed to appear. On July 23, Barreta and Croft lost the title to Justin Angel and Kris Logan. The Dude Busters reclaimed the title when Croft and Curt Hawkins, their new ally, defeated the Rotundos (Bo and Duke) on November 19.

The feud ended when Hawkins and Reks defeated Barreta and Tatsu on the January 18 episode of NXT.

Originally published as a work for adults in English, the story now reaches a demographic of young adults and college students in several countries throughout the world, particularly females. Seventeen is the story of a female adolescent named Sophia. The premise is that of a seventeen-year-old, who, in grappling with the angst of finding one's place in the world, gives herself seven days to either find her purpose or end her life. This, Serafin's literary debut, is of additional significance because he wrote it from the point of view of the opposite gender. Of perhaps deliberate ambiguity is the story's setting, which indisputably is modern-day Manhattan, but in concerning itself with a \\"major university in town,\\" never clarifies whether said university is NYU or Columbia. In either case, there are several pointed attacks at upper class academia in the work, and it is likely that the lack of precision is Serafin's attempt to render a general critique of prestigious institutions rather than a specific one.

In 1975, he was appointed Special Deputy Attorney General to probe into the aftermath of the Attica Prison riot in 1971. His principal task was to evaluate a charge that crimes alleged to have been committed by law enforcement officers during the siege were later covered up by the State. In December 1975, after an eight-month inquiry, Meyer released the first volume of his findings, a 570-page document that came to be known as the Meyer Report. The report concluded that, despite \\"serious errors in judgment,\\" there had been \\"no intentional cover-up\\" by the prosecution. In 1979, he was appointed by Governor Hugh L. Carey to the Court of Appeals, to the seat vacated by the appointment of Lawrence H. Cooke as Chief Judge.

A single-engined biplane, two examples of the Buffalo were built by Sopwith to carry out reconnaissance missions low over the trenches while protected against machine-gun fire from the ground, but no production followed, with the end of the war removing the need for such an aircraft. Development and design In July 1918, the British Air Ministry requested Sopwith, who was already building the Sopwith Salamander armoured single-seat ground attack fighter, to build an armoured two-seat aircraft to carry out the dangerous contact patrol mission.Robertson 1970, p. 229. This mission involved flying at low altitude over the battlefield to locate and keep in contact with attacking forces, therefore keeping commanders in touch with the progress of the battle. This exposed aircraft carrying out such missions to heavy small arms fire from enemy trenches, resulting in heavy casualties.Bruce 1957, p. 629.Mason 1992, p. 139. Sopwith's design, the 3F.2 Buffalo, was a single-engined tractor biplane, with its two-bay wooden wings taken from Sopwith's earlier Bulldog fighter. Like the Salamander, the forward fuselage was made out of armour plate, weighing about 750 lb (340 kg), with the bottom of the fuselage 0.315 in (8 mm) thick, with the sides and front of 0.179 in (5 mm) plate. The armoured box reached back to the observer's cockpit, protecting the crew together with the fuel tanks and pipes, the carburettor and the magnetos.Bruce 1979, p. 199. The first prototype flew on 19 September 1918, flying to France for evaluation in the field on 27 September.Bruce 1979, p. 200. The second prototype, which had its armour extended further aft, flew in October. While tests showed that the Buffalo had good performance, and promised to be an excellent contact patrol aircraft, the end of the war ended plans for large scale production. The two prototypes were sent to No. 43 Squadron, serving with the British Army of Occupation at Bickendorf near Cologne, Germany, but were quickly damaged in crashes.

Glass was born in Bushnell, Illinois, to James and Mary Edith (n√©e Kelly) Glass. After receiving his early education in Sedalia, Missouri, he entered St. Vincent's College at Los Angeles, California, in 1887. He returned to Missouri in 1891 and then enrolled at St. Mary's Seminary in Perryville. From there he joined the Congregation of the Mission, also known as the Lazarists or Vincentians. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop George Thomas Montgomery on August 15, 1897. He then furthered his studies at the College of the Propaganda in Rome, where he earned his Doctor of Divinity in 1899. Upon his return to the United States, Glass taught dogmatic theology at St. Mary's Seminary until 1900, when he became professor of moral theology and director of the seminarians. In June 1901 he was named president of St. Vincent's College and pastor of St. Vincent's Church at Los Angeles. During his 10-year-long presidency, he broadened the curriculum to a full university course and made it one of the most prominent educational institutions in Southern California. On June 1, 1915, Glass was appointed the second Bishop of Salt Lake, Utah, by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 24 from Archbishop Edward Joseph Hanna, with Bishops Thomas Francis Lillis and Thomas Grace serving as co-consecrators. Glass also added murals to the Cathedral of the Madeleine displaying distinctly Catholic beliefs; some claim that he wanted to confront Mormons, but others say he simply \\"wanted to teach Utah Catholics basic tenets of their faith.\\" He once played a poker game with LDS President Heber J. Grant and Elmer Goshen of the First Congregational Church. Glass later died at age 51.

Wallball is a type of school yard game similar to Gaelic Handball, butts up, aces-kings-queens, Chinese handball, P√™l-Law (Welsh handball) and American handball (American handball is sometimes actually referred to as wallball). Kenny Mott is the founding father of wallball. The sport was played by a few schools in the Brandon Manitoba, then began gaining much popularity, resulting in a popular worldwide sport. Wallball is now played globally with the international federation, Wall Ball International, promoting the game. The game requires the ball to be hit to the floor before hitting the wall, but in other respects is similar to squash. It can be played as a singles, doubles or elimination game. Wallball is derived from many New York City street games played by young people, often involving the Spalding hi-bounce balls created in 1949. Objective The objective of wallball is to eliminate all other players in order to be the last player standing, or to be the starter of the game continuously (if the game is endless). There game consists of at-least two players, goes for less than 10 minutes and only requires a bouncy ball. The aim of the game is to hit the ball against a wall. If the person hits the wall and the ball bounces out of play the person next in line loses a life. People first decide who serves. This procedure varies, but is usually the winner of the previous game or the person who got the ball (if that would be the first game), or the new person coming in. The server first hits the ball forward and down so that it hits the ground and bounces up to hit the wall. (If the server is a good sport, an easy ball is started with to get the game going.) If it bounces on the ground more than once or if it doesn't bounce on the ground before it hits the wall, it is considered out. Then, after hitting the wall, the ball would bounce back, and the next person would do the same thing. If the ball bounces more than once before the second player hits it the second person is out, but hitting the ball before it bounces is allowed after the first person hits the ball. If the ball bounces out of bounds (the boundaries are usually determined by the orange lines surrounding the field) at any time, it is considered out, and if it hits the orange line, it is sometimes considered in, sometimes considered out, and sometimes considered a \\"liney\\" or \\"liner\\" in which the game stops and the person who made the liney serves again. The goal is to get the person behind you out by hitting it with the right force and in the right direction. There are sometimes rules called \\"first serves\\", in which the server doesn't get out until the third time the server gets out. There are many variations to the rules, but the rules above are the classic ones. Babies, in which the ball on the second bounce is smaller than the closest interior orange line to the wall (there are two orange lines; one is about three-four feet from the wall, and the other one is about two-thirds of the court away from the wall) and sliceys (or skimmers), where the ball goes at an extremely high speed and extremely low height, are very common varying things (in or out). There are four main types of wallball: regular, teams, line-up, and random. * Regular is where the players line up outside of the court on a bench (which is usually present) or standing if there is no bench, and two players enter the court. They play, and the losing player goes to the end of the line, and the next person comes up. * Teams is the same as regular, except that there are four (or more, but even) players that come up (grouped in equal teams). * Line-up is where all the players line up in a line that is either determined by the winning person or in \\"random order\\", where the players pick the order, and they play in order (the server goes after the last person). * Random is where all the players are scattered around the court, the server serves, and a random person (whoever wants to hit the ball) comes up and hits the ball. In random, when nobody hits the ball, players determine who is out by either considering it a re-do (the server or another person serves again), \\"flinching\\" (the person who reacts to the ball in a fashion that looks like the player is going to hit the ball), nearest person (the closest person to the ball is out), or a combination of nearest person and flinching (if somebody flinches, the flinching person is out; if nobody flinches, the nearest person is out). In line-up or random, the winner of each game usually decides the rules and game style of the next game (usually with the classic rules, but the winner usually has the right to change them, though if enough people disagree, the idea is usually not used), and in regular or teams, the first person to beat the whole line gets to determine the rules and game style of the next game. If playing with a soccer ball/football, they have to hit it wherever it lies, if against Alternative rules Players stand a few feet away from the wall. They may only get three outs (no outs if you want the game to be endless). If a player receives three outs they may be \\"pegged\\", where another player throws the ball at them intending to hit them. A player serves the ball by throwing directly at the wall. The ball then should return to another player. It is not an out if you get the ball again but is considered unfair if you intended to get the ball back (however, if the ball returns to you three times, it is formally known as a \\"tea party\\", and you are out). If the ball bounces first, it is an out. If you drop the ball or the ball hits you, you will have to get to the wall before someone else throws the ball and hits the wall or you will get an out. If you get the ball that is out-of- bounds, players are permitted to shout \\"challenge!\\" During challenges, you have to throw the ball from the same place where you picked up the ball. You may only take tiny steps then throw or move backwards. If you move anywhere else, you will get an out. If a player catches the ball with one hand they may yell \\"South Philly\\" and try to tag as many other players out before they reach safety at the wall. These alternative rules are more common in the Midwest and Canada. In Australia however the rules are slightly different where there are rules for spiking. Spiking is when the ball hits another player on the full without bouncing and the player which is hit goes on the wall. Some versions are played using two walls adjacent to each other, called \\"cube ball\\" where the same rules apply except two walls are used instead of one. Another, called \\"Aceball\\", is similar to wallball except that the ball is hit on the wall without a bounce, then allowed to bounce once before a returning hit is required from the other player. Aceball can be played by kicking it as well, though it is no where near as prominent. Wallball language * Airplane: Someone hits the ball onto the center of the wall but it does not bounce before - aka Rocket. * Angle: Someone hits the ball in such a way that leads the ball out of the playing area. This is especially applied in an outdoor location. * Baby: A small, hard to get shot (ball must clear two feet from the bottom of the wall). * Bad Serve: An incorrect serve which leads to the re- serving of the ball. * Beartrap: When the thrower yells 'Beartrap', you can't grab the ball after it hits the wall or you sit out for a round. * Black Magic: Placing one's hands in front of the ball and maybe pretending to hit it, once (faking the other person out or to get a reaction out of them) but not hitting it, when it is the opponent's turn * Bus stop: When the ball is returned to a player, the player yells \\"Bus stop!\\" and they bounce the ball once and then hit it. * Buttcrack: When the ball hits the ground and the wall at the same time. * Challenge: When a player without the ball shouts challenge, the player with the ball must throw the ball to the wall from where he/she is standing. * Crossy: Similar to an angle, a crossy is a shot played across the wall to make the opposition run for the ball (sometimes called cross country). * Double Bounce: Ball bounces more than once before hitting the wall, leading to elimination. * Drop Shot: Hitting the ball with an angle that makes the ball skim the wall (sometimes called waterfall). (Though \\"Waterfall\\" may also refer to a ball that hits so high/straight/parallel to the wall that it skims the wall twice before coming down.) *High Wire: Also known as a slam, a big hit. * Holdy: Sometimes simply referred to as a \\"hold\\", when someone holds on to the ball rather than slapping/hitting it. * (Hyper) Skimmer: a low, fast-moving ball, a hyper, or super, skimmer goes exceedingly fast and low, and can only be performed by talented players (may be known as something else, like \\"Slicey\\", or \\"Snake\\") Sometimes, \\"Grounder\\", or \\"Roller\\" may be called to force a redo. * Interference: When the ball hits an outside object or hits a player directly after being hit by another player (before hitting the wall). Usually, the judge (the first person in the waiting line) serves on an interference, and calls which player to hit it. Sometimes, if the judge is hit, the judge can get you out. This term may be shortened simply as an inter. * Ogden: When the ball hits the palm of the hand and does not have enough power to reach the wall. * Out of Bounds: When the ball goes out of the intended, pre-determined playing surface. * Overdog: Jumping over the ball instead of hitting it. * Pop: \\"Pop\\" or \\"Poppy\\" (as in \\"no poppies\\"): shot where the ball hits the wall where it meets the ground, and sort of \\"pops\\" out of the corner, usually loudly if using a large red rubber ball (i.e. 4 Square ball)‚Äîdepends on rules agreed before the game but usually illegal (similar to babies) and thus results in the committing player being out. * Rainbow: Player can call \\"Rainbow\\" and must go under the ball without touching the ball successfully, and another player has to hit the ball (sometimes called underdogs or watermelons). * Review: In some games, players can challenge, or ask for a review that they are not out for whatever reason. If they lose the challenge, they cannot challenge anymore. * Shotgun: A hard hit that directly hits the wall, rather than bouncing once; typically followed by the elimination of the player who shot that ball (may be known as something else, such as bullet, jet, and direct). * Skid: The ball returns in a faster pace due to wet contact or the ball's particular rotation. * Slicey: A player swipes their hand under the ball, without touching the ball, and says \\"Slicey!\\" The opponent now has to hit the ball. * Steph Curry: When the player makes a hoop with their arms and lets the ball pass through without hitting their arms. Player must call out \\"Steph Curry!\\" * Time Out: Stopping the game right in the middle of it (player must call \\"Time in\\" to play again). * Top Hat: Player hits the ball on top and says \\"Top Hat!\\", making the ball bounce straight down. The other player must hit the ball before it bounces twice and the ball must hit the ground before it hits the wall. * Trap bounce: Where the ball traps after bouncing once. It typically leads to an elimination or judging. * Traps: Where the ball hits directly on the join between the wall and ground. This can be played on or replayed and is also known as \\"Ace\\", \\"Gutter\\", \\"Gutter-ball\\", \\"Pinchy\\", \\"Pocket\\" \\"Poppy\\", or \\"Pops\\". * Troll time: In the alternate rules when an opposing player throws the ball to the wall a long way away, a player deflects the ball down to the ground touches the wall, then re-throws the ball to the wall all before the opponent has the opportunity to get back to the wall. * Type Writer: Hitting the ball at the wall, then continually hitting the ball without it touching the floor until the hitter sees fit to let the ball rotate to the next player by hitting the ball against the wall one last time with force. Type Writer should not exceed 5 seconds.

It is part of the Saar-Nahe Uplands.  Geography   Location  The North Palatine Uplands lie ‚Äì roughly stated ‚Äì between St. Wendel in the state of Saarland to the west and three towns belonging to Rhineland-Palatinate: Alzey to the east, Kaiserslautern to the south and Bad Kreuznach to the north, although these towns are not actually within the region itself. The North Palatine Uplands thus links the landscapes of the Palatine Forest, Saar-Hunsr√ºck Nature Park, Naheland and Rheinhessen. To the northwest its boundary with Naheland is not always clear. A rough guide is the heavily folded ridge north of the Glan river with a height different of as much as 300 metres in place. The North Palatine Uplands fall mainly within the districts of Kusel and Donnersbergkreis. To a lesser extent it also falls within parts of Kaiserslautern, St. Wendel, Birkenfeld and Bad Kreuznach.  Hills  Donnersberg The North Palatine Uplands is characterised by numerous mountains, hills and valleys which lend the area sharp variations in height from about 200 to over . The highest point is the Donnersberg which, at 687 m is also the highest mountain in the Palatinate. The following is a list of prominent mountains and hills in the Uplands, sorted by height in metres above sea level (NHN): * Donnersberg (686.5 m)Inscription on the granite rock of the trig point on the Donnersberg rock formation of K√∂nigsstuhl * Trautzberg (603.9 m) * F√ºsselberg (595.1 m) * Weiselberg (569.5 m) * K√∂nigsberg (568.2 m) * Potzberg (562 m) * Selberg (545.1 m) * Herrmannsberg (536.4 m) * Bornberg (520.0 m)  Rivers  Bridge over the Glan in Meisenheim Important rivers in the west and north of the range are the 90 km long Glan and the 57 km long Alsenz. The 116 km long Nahe, into which the other two discharge, is no longer included in this region. The area of the Donnersberg is drained towards the east by the 43 km long Pfrimm, which itself rises in the northern Palatine Forest, and the 61 km long Selz. Both flow into the Upper Rhine.  Name  The North Palatine Uplands is also referred to locally as the \\"Old World\\" ( or in Palatinate German: die alt Welt or bucklige Welt).Verlag Eugen Ulmer: Die Pfalz ist eine Reise wert However, sometimes the term alte Welt just refers to a strip of land on the border of the districts of Kusel and Kaiserslautern, which is roughly demarcated by the 420, 270 and 48 federal highways and the A 6 and A 63 motorways. Depending on how the region is defined, its largest village is either Nu√übach or Obermoschel.  Settlement  The Altstadt in Meisenheim The region is very rural in character and has no towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants. Important places are the county towns of Kirchheimbolanden and Kusel, and the collective municipalities of Alsenz, Altenglan, Lauterecken, Meisenheim, Rockenhausen, Winnweiler and Wolfstein.

This came about with the arrival of digital systems in the 1960s, when improving the performance of communications networks became a real possibility. However, this technology was not completely adopted until the mid-1970s, due to the large amount of analog systems already in place and the high cost of digital systems, as semiconductors were very expensive. PCM‚Äôs initial goal was that of converting an analog voice telephone channel into a digital one based on the sampling theorem. PCM30 describes an application of pulse-code modulation (PCM) in which 30 telephony analog signals are binary coded into a digital signal stream. The term is used today mostly as a synonym for the encoding of 30 channels each with a signalling rate of 64-kbit/s. This rate is also used in the first stage of European PDH technique, so PCM30 is also known as E1. Originally it described a device in communications technology which converted the 30 analog telephone signals into a digital bit stream of 2048 kbit/s.......... PDH and T-carrier At the beginning of the 1960s, the proliferation of analog telephone lines, based on copper wires, together with the lack of space for new installations, led the transmission experts to look at the real application of PCM digitalization techniques and TDM multiplexing. The first digital communications system was set up by Bell Labs in 1962, and consisted of 24 digital channels running at what is known as T1.  Basic Rates: T1 and E1  In 1965, that permitted the TDM multiplexing of 24 digital telephone channels of 64 kbit/s into a 1.544-Mbit/s signal with a format called T1. For the T1 signal, a synchronization bit is added to the 24 TDM time slots, in such a way that the aggregate transmission rate is: ::(24channels √ó 8bit‚ÅÑ channel \\\\+ 1bit) ‚ÅÑ 125Œºs = 1.544Mbps ::(125 Œºs is the sampling period) Europe developed its own TDM multiplexing scheme a little later (1968), although it had a different capacity: 32 digital channels of 64 kbit/s. The resulting signal was transmitted at 2.048 Mbit/s, and its format was called E1 which was standardized by the ITU-T and adopted worldwide except in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. For an E1 signal, the aggregate transmission rate can be obtained from the following equation: (32channels √ó 8bit ‚ÅÑ channel) ‚ÅÑ 125Œºs = 2.048Mbit/s PCM30 system The PCM30-base system, the analog switching technology in Europe, and served on the digital transmission of telephone traffic. It has 30 coders, each with a phone channel in an 8-bit digital word (byte) can implement. The 30 bytes are, together with a frame ID word, and a channel identifier, bytewise successively sent (see Multiplexer). Thus, a large 32-byte frame. In receiving direction, the 30 channels are, using a de-multiplexer, converted back to 30 analogue signals. The time slot 0 is used as a frame ID word, and as word detection is used. These are sent alternately. Time slot 16 is a channel identifier for the speech channels. Each voice channel is assigned 4 bits, one after the other in 16, there is an over-under with a frequency of 500 Hz and a length of 16 ‚ãÖ 32 ‚ãÖ 8 # 4096 bits. Operation summary The analog input signals are initially passed through a low-pass filter. Then, the signals from the multiplexer are cyclically sampled at a frequency of 8 kHz. There is a PAM signal all injected signals. This is after the A-curve h√∂rgerecht quantized by an analogue to digital (A/D) converter as 8-bit binary word coded. Since 8000 samples each second, each with 8 bits to be made is that each bit stream at 64 kbit/s. The sum of all 32 channels #30 channels + 2 telephone management channels# the bit rate of 2048 kbit/s. For the transmission is still not suitable binary signal. Conducted DC transmission requires freedom and constant synchronous information. The binary bit stream is therefore on the intermediate stage of the AMI code in the HDB3 code umcodiert. The entire bit stream of 32 Fernsprechkan√§len is HDB3 encoded with 2.048 Mbit/s on the distant opposite body. Distances> 3.5 km with regenerators, the so-called Line equipment bridges. Since 2005 in Almanya but no PCM30 lines on HDB3 base provided. Instead, the 2B1Q - encoding used by the baud rate #Vs# at a constant transmission rate #VUE# in half and allows the signal to a lower frequency band to relocate. This in turn has a positive effect on the attenuation of the signal and its range.

Reinerite has a relative hardness of 5 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale which is equivalent to that of a knife blade and or shard of glass. It has a density of 4.27 g/cm3, and it exhibits a nonmetallic luster that may be described as glassy or vitreous.Lutgens, Frederick, and Edward Tarbuck. Essentials of Geology. 10th. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 42. Print. Environment Reinerite develops in dolomite-hosted locations. It is known especially from Namibia, Africa, within the mines of Tsumeb. At the Tsumeb location, Reinerite develops within the polymetallic lead-zinc-copper deposit, below the surface, in the second oxidation zone. It occurs in association with chalcocite, bornite, willemite, smithsonite, hydrozincite, hemimorphite, adamite, olivenite and gebhardite. History Reinerite was first described in 1958 for an occurrence in the Tsumeb Mine, Tsumeb, Namibia and named for senior chemist Willy Reiner (1895‚Äì1965) of Tsumeb Corporation, who analyzed this mineral.

The western terminus is at an intersection with PA 171 and PA 374 near the community of Union Dale in Herrick Center. The eastern terminus is at the New York state line in Damascus Township where it crosses the Delaware River on the Cochecton‚ÄìDamascus Bridge. It continues into Sullivan County, New York, as County Route 114 (CR 114), which heads east toward New York State Route 97 (NY 97). PA 371 originates as a road cut in 1791 and later used for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike in 1806\\\\. The new turnpike was finished in 1811 and renamed as the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike in accordance for the extension to Great Bend, Pennsylvania. The turnpike was abandoned in 1853\\\\. PA 371 was originally designated along the turnpike route in 1936 by the Department of Highways from Great Bend to Damascus. The route remained intact until 1954, when the route was truncated back to PA 171 in Herrick Center. The route was replaced by PA 374 and PA 848 in 1961.  Route description  PA 371 begins at an intersection with PA 171 and PA 374 in the community of Herrick Center. The route heads eastward, progressing through rural forests north of Union Dale. PA 371 begins in Susquehanna County, but just a short distance from Herricks Center, crosses into Wayne County. The route heads to the east, but soon begins to curve to the north, entering the community of Belmont Corners. PA 371 becomes known as the Great Bend Turnpike, leaving Belmont Corners at an intersection with PA 670 (Belmont Turnpike). At the intersection, PA 371 and PA 670 becomes concurrent for a distance. The routes head eastward through the forests in northern Wayne County. A short distance later, PA 371 and PA 670 enter the community of Pleasant Mount, where the alignment becomes surrounded by residences. In Pleasant Mount, PA 371 and PA 670 head eastward as the main street in the community until a split at the eastern end of the community. There, PA 371 continues eastward along the Great Bend Turnpike while PA 670 forks to the southeast along the Bethany Turnpike. PA 371 heads eastward through fields until an intersection with \\"Crossroad\\", where it turns to the southeast towards the center of Mount Pleasant Township. The highway continues on the southeast pattern for a distance, past a large farm and into more forests nearby. At an intersection with Bush Road, PA 371 changes direction, heading to the northwest along the Turnpike. A short distance later, the highway heads through the rural farmlands until entering the community of Niagara. In the small community, the highway intersects with PA 247, where they start a short concurrency. The two routes head northward for a short distance, until PA 371 splits to the east. Cochecton-Damascus Bridge, the dividing line between PA 371 and Sullivan CR 114 PA 371 continues eastward through the rural regions, continuing its way through Mount Pleasant Township. The highway intersects with Township Road 613 (TR 613), where the highway makes a hairpin turn to the south. The route continues to the southeast into a denser portion of Lebanon Township. The route continues for a distance to the east until an intersection with TR 614 in the community of Cold Spring. In Cold Spring, PA 371 turns to the southeast through deep forests until an intersection with TR 612 and TR 617\\\\. There, the forests break, and the route continues to the southeast. A short distance later, PA 371 intersects with PA 191 (Hancock Highway) in the community of Rileyville. There, the route begins to follow the alignment of the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike. PA 371 continues through rural farmlands until a hairpin turn in the deep forests nearby. After leaving the deep forests, the route re-emerges in Damascus Township's community of West Damascus. The route heads to the southeast even further into Fallsdale, where it passes two large ponds and several athletic fields. At the end of the eastern pond, PA 371 turns to the northeast crossing a creek and into the community of Tyler Hill. The route heads to the northeast through a small developed portion of the community before turning to the southeast and soon to the northeast again. The route continues to the northeast for a short distance before reaching the Delaware River, where PA 371 ends at the New York state line on the Cochecton-Damascus Bridge and continues into Sullivan County as CR 114.  History  Records indicate that the alignment of PA 371 was first constructed as a cut from the Delaware River to the community of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, in 1791 through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties. In 1801, the state legislature of New York and Pennsylvania brought up the proposal for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (later the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike) to connect the Hudson River to the Delaware River. Although the route was finished in New York, the portion in Pennsylvania was not legislated until March 29, 1804. Construction through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties commenced in 1806, with completion of the roadway coming in 1811. At that point, the turnpike was extended onto the cut in Pennsylvania to the Susquehanna River. The turnpike was used for transportation of farmers' goods and stock along with a route for pioneers to use for heading westward. After construction of the original Cochecton- Damascus Bridge in 1817 (and later in 1821),Dale, Frank T. Bridges Over The Delaware River: A History of Crossings. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2003. . the area around the bridge became a bustling community. The alignment of what is now PA 371 eventually became littered with a large rate of development, with nineteenth-century style buildings constructed in Damascus. The turnpike itself fared poorly later on, and was abandoned in 1853\\\\. Although the roadway itself was abandoned, the turnpike corporation that was supposed to maintain the roadway remained intact until 1868, when it was dissolved. Even afterwards, the roadway remained the only physical route in the area until at least the 1890s. On August 14, 1992, the stretch of PA 371 from Galilee Road to the Delaware River was entered into the National Register of Historic Places as the Damascus Historic District. The record for the National Register included the roadway and forty different structures along the roadway for its historical significance. Originally, a short portion of PA 371 was part of PA 170 in the 1928 mass numbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. 83 years after the abandonment of the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike (1936), the Pennsylvania Department of Highways took over the alignment of the highway for the designation of Legislative PA 371\\\\. The route at that point began at an intersection of U.S. Route 11 in Great Bend to the state line on the Delaware River in Damascus. The route remained intact along the turnpike for only eighteen years when in 1954, the Department of Highways truncated PA 371 back to the intersection with PA 171 in the community of Herrick Center. Seven years later, the Department of Highways designated both PA 374 on the alignment from Royal to Herrick Center and PA 848 from the community of New Milford (south of Great Bend) to Gibson.

He was subsequently named a W Network Money Expert. He writes a personal finance column for The Globe and Mail and is also author of the Canadian personal finance blog WhereDoesAllMyMoneyGo.com which was voted Canada's #1 Investment Blog in 2010 by readers of The Globe and Mail. In 2012, he launched a personal finance podcast which currently ranks as one of the most popular financial podcasts on iTunes. Career Banerjee graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from University of Toronto Scarborough in 2001 (May). He immediately enrolled in the Bridgestone Racing Academy in hopes of becoming a racecar driver, and missed his university convocation to instead participate in the racing school's curriculum. After graduating from the Bridgestone Racing Academy in 2001 (October), Banerjee returned to the Academy to serve as their Operations Manager from 2002 until 2004. He started his career in the financial services as a Consultant shortly thereafter with Investors Group Financial Services in Whitby, Ontario. He remained there for two years before deciding that a largely proprietary product offering was not an ideal solution for all Canadian investors. Banerjee left Investors Group Financial Services to join ScotiaMcLeod, the wealth management division of The Bank Of Nova Scotia, as a stockbroker and financial planner, although he never held a recognized financial planning designation. While there he became acquainted with passive investment management strategies (which were not offered at Investors Group) and his client portfolios soon became dominated by index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which Banerjee claimed was the basis of rational portfolio construction. He also preferred offering clients their choice of how to pay fees: 1. Transactional, 2. Percentage-of-assets, or 3. Fee-for-service and emphasized transparency within advisor-client relationships. Banerjee was described as part of \\"the new breed of financial advisors\\" by The National Post. Banerjee was one of less than one hundred Canadian financial advisors who sold Dimensional Fund Advisors' \\"enhanced\\" index funds, which combine elements of active and passive management. He was also an early adopter of fundamental indexation, specifically the FTSE RAFI methodology created by Robert Arnott's firm Research Affiliates. He joined Pro-Financial Asset Management as Senior Vice President in late 2008, responsible for institutional sales, product development and general education of financial advisors as well as the public on the discussion between active management and passive management. Pro-Financial Asset Management is a mutual fund manufacturer specializing in the FTSE RAFI fundamental index funds. He left Pro-Financial abruptly in June 2011.  Financial Commentator  Banerjee appears regularly in print, TV and radio media as an expert commentator. In late 2010, he became a regular contributor to CBC's The National with Peter Mansbridge's \\"Bottom Line\\" panel which discusses money issues for Canadians. In late 2011, CBC made the decision to increase the frequency of The Bottom Line panel to a monthly basis. The panel also includes Patricia Croft, Amanda Lang and Jim Stanford. He has filled in for Kevin O'Leary as co-host of CBC's The Lang and O'Leary Exchange on an infrequent basis and has also appeared on CTV and Global National News.  WhereDoesAllMyMoneyGo.com Blog  Banerjee launched his personal finance and investing blog, WhereDoesAllMyMoneyGo.com on July 23, 2007. It reached 1.5 million cumulative pageviews by 2011.  Mostly Money, Mostly Canadian Podcast  On April 27, 2012, Banerjee published the first episode of his new personal finance podcast, Mostly Money, Mostly Canadian. The first five episodes each reached #1 on iTunes in both the \\"Business\\" and \\"Investing\\" categories. The podcast carries an R-rating and features interviews with notable personal finance and investing personalities.

Early life  He was a born Pratesi and is first mentioned as a jurist doctor and chamberlain in Florence in 1433. In 1437, he practised justice in Bologna and entered church services, then went to Florence again where he eventually became a canonicus in Florence. He served as apostolic treasurer in Bologna from 1450 to 1452 as well as in other functions and made several important friends in the clergy. Pope Callistus III appointed him bishop of Terni in 1458.  Coppini Mission  On 7 January 1459 he was appointed as nuncio by Pope Pius II with support from Francesco I Sforza, Duke of Milan. Departing some weeks later, he gave the name to the Coppini Mission to England with the double purpose of bringing about an end to the Wars of the Roses, and persuading King Henry VI of England to join the crusade against the Turks. He was also given instructions to carry out in Burgundy, Cambrai and the Netherlands. He arrived in Dover on 4 June 1459, then travelled to London, where he initially opened negotiations with Henry VI and delivered his invitation to the Council of Mantua to where Henry had already sent a small and ineffectual delegation on 16 May. The council fell short of achieving the goals of Pius II, among other reasons due to the instable balance between England and France at that time that the English crown needed to maintain. Regarding the second part of his mission to mediate between York and Lancaster, Coppini was unable to achieve much in his limited role as nuncio instead of a full papal legate. To further his influence on England, Pius II nominated Coppini legate to England and Scotland on 11 December 1459 and asked him to propose another convent in 1460 to the English court. Coppini was also appointed as collector for a special tithe dedicated to battle the Turks. After his attempts to collect the tithe and proclaim the crusade were rebuffed by Queen Margaret of Anjou in 1460, Coppini entered into negotiations with the Yorkists (namely the Earl of Warwick, the Earl of March and the Earl of Salisbury) and returned from Bruges on 2 July 1460. Still proclaiming to seek negotiation, Coppini explicitly favoured the Yorkist cause at the Battle of Northampton. With Henry VI now under control of the Yorkists, Coppini supposedly played a crucial role in arranging a new order in the kingdom, as he reported to Pius II. As he had been promised by the Yorkists, he could now fulfil his papal mission. After the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460 however, the tides temporarily turned against York. In January 1461, Coppini sent fruitless letters of negotiation to Queen Margaret, then called for a crusade against the Lancastrians, promising absolution for those fighting alongside Warwick. Preparing for the worst, Coppini left London for the mainland on 10 February 1461. After the Second Battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461, he terminated his mission and fled to Bruges. He then travelled between Mechelen, Antwerp and Paris, still in close contact with the Yorkists.  Trial and exile  In the aftermath of the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, both King Edward VI and Coppini's patron in Milan, Francesco Sforza, pleaded the pope to announce Coppini for the position of legate cardinal in England as reward for his services. Pius II however named the bishop of Arras as Coppini's successor to address concerns by the new French king Louis XI, who had sided with the Lancastrians in England. Coppini returned to England in the bishops entourage, but after French and Lancastrian complaints to the Pope, he finally returned to Rome in disgrace in November 1461. In March 1462, Pius II partially yielded to political demands. A process against Francesco Coppini was opened, he was dismissed from his bishopric and sent to Castel Sant'Angelo. Charges were among others: simony, embezzlement and raising the banner of the church to incite civil war. Coppini confessed under pressure and on 2 March 1463, he was banished to the Abbey of St Paul Outside the Walls. He took the name of Ignatius on 21 March 1463. Still working on his rehabilitation under the new Pope Paul II, he died on 29 September 1464. References *John A.

A number of controversies occurred during Herzog's tenure on the NLRB, contributing to passage of the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act. Among these was a proposal by Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach and Rep. Fred A. Hartley, Jr. (R-N.J.) to outlaw communist parties and require a non-communist oath from labor leaders.\\"Ban on Reds Urged by Schwellenbach.\\" Associated Press. March 12, 1947. Another was a growing movement in 1946 and 1947 to amend the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to correct what critics saw as a pro-labor tilt in federal law.Stark, Louis. \\"Save Bargaining, Keep Peace In Industry, Says NLRB Head.\\" New York Times. March 7, 1947.Gross, James A. Broken Promise: The Subversion of U.S. Labor Relations Policy, 1947-1994. Philadelphia, Pa.: Temple University Press, 2003. Herzog publicly admitted the need for some change in the NLRA, but privately in a series of memoranda to President Truman strongly opposed the proposed Taft-Hartley amendments. He felt the communist oath provisions were unconstitutional, that the amendments would turn the NLRA into a management weapon, that creation of an independent General Counsel would weaken the NLRB, and that the law's dismantling of the agency's economic analysis unit deprived the NLRB of essential expertise. Nonetheless, Congress overrode Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Act on June 23, 1947, and the bill became law.Lee, R. Alton. Truman and Taft-Hartley: A Question of Mandate. Lexington, Ky.: University of Kentucky Press, 1966. Implementing Taft-Hartley Herzog's implementation of the Taft-Hartley Act proved problematic. Herzog and other NLRB staff had secretly worked with pro-labor members of Congress to draft critical analyses of the Taft-Hartley bill, draft speeches critical of the bill, and even draft legislation for liberal Republican members of Congress designed to water down the bill. When these actions were uncovered, conservative members of Congress tried to have Herzog removed from office. Herzog considered resigning (as many other NLRB staff did) and even consulted with Truman about it (who counseled him to stay on). Liberal Republican Senator Irving Ives talked to conservative Republican Senator Robert A. Taft about it, but to both Ives' and Herzog's astonishment Taft said he believed Herzog should remain. The Taft-Hartley Act made the office of the NLRB General Counsel independent from the Chair; the question was who should become General Counsel now that Gerhard Van Arkel (the previous counsel) had resigned in the wake of the Taft-Hartley Act's passage. NLRB Member James J. Reynolds suggested 62-year-old NLRB trial lawyer Robert N. Denham, a strong conservative who had exhibited near-racist views in some of his opinions. When he learned of Denham's nomination,Stark, Louis. \\"Truman Fills New NLRB, Denham Is General Counsel.\\" New York Times. July 18, 1947. Herzog exclaimed, \\"My god, that's appalling!\\"Gross, Broken Promise: The Subversion of U.S. Labor Relations Policy, 1947-1994, 2003, p. 19. Once installed as General Counsel, Denham announced that all American Federation of Labor (AFL) and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) leaders and their affiliate unions would be denied the protection of the NLRA if a single officer at any level refused to sign a non-communist oath\\"Unions Are Warned on a Red Disclaimer.\\" United Press International.

The CIO, 1935-1955. Reprint ed. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1997. In what was seen as a major test of how much authority the Board retained vis-a-vis the General Counsel,Stark, Louis. \\"Expect overriding of Denham Today.\\" New York Times. October 6, 1947. the NLRB held in Northern Virginia Broadcasters, Inc., 75 NLRB 11 (1947) that the anti-communist oath provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act applied only to local, national, and international leaders and not to officers of national trade union centers like the AFL or CIO.Stark, Louis. \\"NLRB Is Expected to Overrule, 4-1, Denham Red Stand.\\" New York Times.

For two years, Herzog and Denham also struggled over whether the Board or the General Counsel had the authority to assert jurisdiction in unfair labor practice cases. In May 1949, in A-1 Photo Service, 83 NLRB 564 (1949) and Pereira Studios, 83 NLRB 587 (1949), Herzog finally concluded that the Board and Board alone had that authority. Herzog's conflict with Denham worsened when, in November 1949, Denham issued an unfair labor practice against the AFL in Haleston Drug Stores, Inc., 86 NLRB 1166 (1949), and the Board refused to hear the case by declining jurisdiction over the matter. When the employer appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Denham not only refused to represent the Board but actively assisted the employer in seeking to overturn the Board's action. Acting on recommendations generated by the Hoover Commission, Herzog prevailed upon President Truman to issue Reorganization Plan No. 12, which would abolish the office of General Counsel and transfer its functions back to the Board. But Senator Taft refused to let Truman oust Denham through subterfuge, and the reorganization plan failed to win Congressional approval.Stark, Louis. \\"Taft Sees Politics in NLRB Reform.\\" New York Times. April 5, 1950; Stark, Louis. \\"Keep Denham Role, Business Men Ask.\\" New York Times. April 6, 1950; Stark, Louis. \\"Denham Predicts 'Chaos' If Ousted.\\" New York Times. April 7, 1950. Herzog now resolved to have Denham removed: :Denham had survived the legislative battles, but he was out-matched when pitted against Herzog in bureaucratic in-fighting. As a special assistant in the White House put it, Herzog waged his battle with \\"extraordinary subtlety,\\" \\"watching and waiting for bigger and better errors by Denham,\\" using \\"restraint,\\" \\"proper erudition,\\" \\"protective camouflage,\\" \\"the public handshake, the smile, and the knife so fast that you are never aware of it until the severed head rolls.\\"Gross, Broken Promise: The Subversion of U.S. Labor Relations Policy, 1947-1994, 2003, p. 65. Just before a May 22, 1950, meeting between Denham and the Board, Herzog met with President Truman and was told to stand firm against any encroachment on the Board's authority. The meeting between Denham and the Board degenerated into bitter personal criticism. Herzog met with Truman, advising the President of his intention to leave. Truman asked Herzog to stay, and Herzog agreed‚Äîif Denham were fired. Truman agreed, and on July 24, 1950, Herzog was reappointed to another five- year term as NLRB Chair. When Denham made changes to the NLRB's appellate brief in the Vulcan Forging case,Vulcan Forging, 85 NLRB 621 (1949). the five Board members asked President Truman to act to prevent further undermining of administration labor policy and additional embarrassment in the courts. Truman asked Denham to resign on September 15, 1950, and Denham did so.\\"Ousted Counsel Accuses NLRB Head.\\" Associated Press. February 28, 1953. Post- Denham NLRB tenure Between 1947 and 1953, Herzog led Board majorities in concluding that NLRB-sponsored union organizing elections could not be held at workplaces controlled by a union shop contract if the state in question had banned the union shop,Contracts requiring the union shop were generally grandfathered under such bans, which raised the question the NLRB was forced to confront.

This is a subfamily within the very large family Muricidae, the murex or rock snails. According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005), this group is considered to be a subfamily, the Coralliophilinae, of the family Muricidae.Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P. (Ed.); Fr√Ωda J., Hausdorf B., Ponder W., Vald√©s √Å. & War√©n A. 2005. Classification and nomenclator of gastropod families. Malacologia: International Journal of Malacology, 47(1-2). ConchBooks: Hackenheim, Germany. . . 397 pp. http://www.vliz.be/Vmdcdata/imis2/ref.php?refid=78278 Prior to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005), the Coralliophilinae was recognized as a distinct family the Coralliophilidae. The subfamily Coralliophilinae is monophyletic, as confirmed by genetic research with molecular markers.  Distribution and habitat The coral snails are coral dwellers that occur worldwide in temperate and tropical seas. They can be found in very diverse places such as the mid-Atlantic seamounts, the Canary Islands, the deep water coral banks in the Mediterranean, from the Florida Keys to Brazil, the Indo- Pacific Region, the southwest Pacific, the Austral Islands (South Pacific). Such a dispersal of the subfamily can be attributed to oceanic currents and planktotrophic larval development. Oliverio, Marco; Gofas, Serge, Coralliophiline diversity at mid-Atlantic seamounts (Neogastropoda, Muricidae, Coralliophilinae) , Bulletin of Marine Science, Volume 79, Number 1, July 2006 , pp. 205-230(26) These snails are specialist feeders, feeding exclusively on anthozoans by boring into them. A few live between soft corals and anemones and use their long and extensible proboscis to ingest the soft tissue. Some feed on sea fans.

This film was the first in a proposed series of shorts teaching the principles of music, called Adventures in Music. Only one other film in the series was made, Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom. Walt Disney was always a fan of music, and it shows in all of his movies and short films. He said: \\"There's a terrific power to music. You can run any of these pictures and they'd be dragging and boring, but the minute you put music behind them, they have life and validity they don't get any other way.\\"Hischack, Thomas. The Disney Song Encyclopedia, Preface Plot The short film shows Professor Owl instructing his class of birds on how to find melody around them. The short starts with the birds entering the schoolhouse and Professor Owl taking roll call. Following this, Professor Owl discusses that today they will learn about melodies \\"something we really cannot do without\\", although Bertie Birdbrain interrupts him with multiple guesses of what the topic of the short is about and what melody means. Professor Owl then plays several notes on the piano to give us a clear demonstration of how melodies are assembled. Following this, they fly off to discover the many melodic sounds of nature. However, Bertie cannot hear them because his dunce cap is stuck on his head. Professor Owl pulls it off unstuck to make him feel better. Then there is a short music interlude in which the chorus sings about the sounds of nature that are listed. Following this, Professor Owl discusses of how the only two creatures that can sing are birds and humans. After showing the male example, the male caricature asks what he means, and Owl demonstrates by mocking him while playing notes on the saxophone. Then he shows some female examples which are more musical than average males. The female voices overlap causing Owl's ears to get off track. He then demands the females to shut up and be quiet so that he can re-concentrate and continue the lesson. Then there is a scene that shows the \\"Steps of life\\", demonstrating how melody is evident throughout the life of an average man. As we go through time, the overall colors shown for each step changes subtlety, as warm ochre, yellows and reds, suggesting growth and vitality, are for his childhood and school years, up until his marriage. When he gets older, the color scheme subtlety changes from reds to purples to blues, depicting maturity and loss of vitality. There is a quick survey of the stages of life, as captured by songs: \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\" for birth, \\"The Alphabet Song\\" for primary school, \\"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\\" for college, \\"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes\\" for the 'mating season', \\"Here Comes the Bride\\" and there goes the groom for their Wedding Day, \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" on the man's 'prime of life' at the top before the descending begins, \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" for the middle aged man who is beginning to regret getting older, \\"Silver Threads Among the Gold\\" for getting the first gray hair, \\"The Old Gray Mare\\" when the man's body begins to feel his age as he falls down hard on the stairs, \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" for the decrepit old man before he gets his 'reward' (while being kicked off by the baby New Year's), and \\"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\\" finishes it off with the man who gave up his ghost and gleefully became one more angel for the Heavenly Band while wearing the Golden Slippers. Some inspirations for song are outlined in song (such as love), but Penelope Pinfeather in the class states that they never, ever sing about brains. Finally, an example is shown of how a simple melody can be expanded into a symphony: an elaborate version of the simple tune which opened the lesson.

The castle was the site of an extraordinary instance of the U.S. Army, German Wehrmacht, Austrian Resistance, and the prisoners themselves fighting side-by-side against the Waffen-SS in the Battle for Castle Itter in early May 1945 prior to the end of the war. Location The hill castle is located atop a Itter Castle Elevation and Position knoll at the entrance to the Brixental valley, about south of W√∂rgl and west of Kitzb√ºhel. History Entrance, July 1979 A fortress at the site was first mentioned in a 1241 deed; previous constructions may have existed since the 10th century. The Brixental originally was a possession of the Prince-Bishops of Regensburg; the castle was an administrative seat of the Counts of Ortenburg in their capacity as Vogt bailiffs, and it also served to protect the Regensburg estates from incursions undertaken by the neighbouring Archbishops of Salzburg. Nevertheless, the Brixental was acquired by Salzburg in 1312, and in 1380 the Regensburg bishops finally sold Itter to Archbishop Pilgrim II of Salzburg. Within the Burgfrieden jurisdiction of Itter, feuds and breach of the public peace were banned, nevertheless the castle was devastated during the German Peasants' War in 1526. In the 17th century, the seat of the local administration was moved to Hopfgarten, whereafter the premises decayed. The Brixental belonged to Salzburg until it fell to the newly established Kingdom of Bavaria in 1805; the Bavarian government left the castle ruin to the Itter citizens who used it as a quarry. Upon the Final Act of the Vienna Congress, the valley became part of the Austrian, crown land of Tyrol in 1816. The present-day building was erected on the foundations of the former one from 1878 onwards. Itter Castle was purchased as a residence in 1884 by Sophie Menter, pianist, composer, and student of Franz Liszt. Liszt himself as well as young Arthur Rubinstein stayed at the castle; Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky orchestrated one of his compositions during a visit in 1892. Menter sold Itter Castle in 1902; it was again extensively remodeled in its present Tudor Revival style by later owners. World War II Itter Castle seen from the southeast, 1979 After the 1938 Anschluss annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, the Reich government officially leased the castle in late 1940 from its owner, Franz Gr√ºner. Itter Castle was seized from Gr√ºner by SS Lieutenant General Oswald Pohl under the orders of Heinrich Himmler on February 7, 1943, and transformed into a prison by April 25, 1943. Established to incarcerate prominent French prisoners valuable to the Reich, the facility was placed as a subcamp under the administration of the Dachau concentration camp. Notable prisoners included: former Prime Ministers √âdouard Daladier and Paul Reynaud; Generals Maurice Gamelin and former commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who had been prominent during the Phoney War; former tennis champion Jean Borotra, later General Commissioner of Sports in the Vichy regime; right-wing leader Fran√ßois de La Rocque, leader of the right-wing Croix de Feu movement; trade union leader L√©on Jouhaux; Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, a politician and diplomat; and Michel Clemenceau, politician and son of Georges Clemenceau. The former republic president Albert Lebrun was held at Itter for three months in 1943, before being sent back to France for health reasons; Marie-Agn√®s de Gaulle, Resistance member and sister of General Charles de Gaulle, was interned in the castle at the very end of the war, in April 1945. Besides the French VIP prisoners, the Castle held a number of Eastern European prisoners detached from Dachau, who were used for maintenance and other menial work. Battle for Castle Itter On the afternoon of May 4, 1945, the prison's commander fled. Shortly after the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde guards followed, the prisoners armed themselves and awaited rescue from anticipated attack from Waffen SS troops still aggressively resisting surrender. Two Sherman tanks of the 23rd Tank Battalion of the U.S. 12th Armored Division under the command of Capt. John C. ‚ÄòJack‚Äô Lee, Jr., and anti-Nazi elements of the Wehrmacht under the command of Major Josef ‚ÄòSepp‚Äô Gangl, arrived. Together the three groups repelled probes by SS reconnaissance elements throughout the night. The battle continued through the morning of 5 May, with a strong force of 100‚Äì150 SS pressing the attack until reinforcements from the American 142nd Infantry Regiment arrived around 4 PM that day. Castle Itter today After the war, the castle fell into disrepair until 1950 when Willi Woldrich acquired it and turned it into a luxury hotel. However, the hotel encountered financial problems and it was acquired by a holding company before it was sold to a private owner in 1985. Since that time, it has remained in private ownership and is not open to the public. It is owned by attorney Dr. Ernst Bosin from the city of Kufstein, Austria.

It was originally built to designs of the architect Charles Garnier for the display of a panorama, which opened in 1883. The panorama was converted to the Th√©√¢tre Marigny in 1894 by the architect √âdouard Niermans and became a home to operetta and other musical theatre. Panorama An earlier theatre on the site, the Salle Lacaze, became known in 1855, as the home of Jacques Offenbach's Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens, where he first built his reputation as a theatre composer. In 1864 this became the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Marigny, which was demolished in 1881, giving way to a panorama built by Charles Garnier. In 1885, dioramas on Paris through the ages by Theodor Josef Hubert Hoffbauer (1839‚Äì1922), and on Jerusalem on the day of the death of Christ, by Olivier Pichat, were displayed. Theatre In 1894, √âdouard Niermans converted the venue into a theatre-in-the-round for summer musical spectacles.Pinchon Jean-Fran√ßois, √âdouard Niermans, architecte de la Caf√©- Society, 1991, The hall was enlarged and modernized in 1925 by Volterra, and in that form opened with a revival of Monsieur Beaucaire by Andr√© Messager. This success led the management to devote the venue mainly to operetta and other musical theatre until the 1930s. Thereafter the Marigny mounted boulevard shows and revivals (such as Jacques Offenbach's La Cr√©ole by in 1936). In 1946 the Th√©√¢tre Marigny welcomed a troupe from the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise to form the Renaud-Barrault company, and in 1954, Barrault opened a smaller \\"Petit Marigny\\". The Grenier-Hussenot troupe followed and later the hall became a cinema. In 1965 the direction passed to Elvira Popescu; in 1978 she was succeeded by John Bodson. In 2000 the theatre was acquired by the Artemis Group, owned by Fran√ßois Pinault, who asked Robert Hossein to take over the theatre's direction. In 2008 Hossein retired and was replaced by Pierre Lescure.

Originally entitled Mickey's Amateur Concert during production, the cartoon depicts an amateur talent show hosted by Mickey Mouse. It was the 94th short film in the Mickey Mouse film series, and the fifth for that year. It was co-directed by Pinto Colvig, Erdman Penner, and Walt Pfeiffer, and features original and adapted music by Oliver Wallace. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey, Clarence Nash as Donald Duck, Florence Gill as Clara Cluck, and Pinto Colvig as Pete and Goofy.Mickey's Amateurs at the Big Cartoon DataBaseMickey's Amateurs at The Internet Animation Database Plot Mickey Mouse is hosting an amateur talent show in front of a live audience for radio, in which he terminates unworthy performances by ringing a gong. In the first scene, Mickey's gong ends Pete's rendition of \\"Asleep in the Deep\\". Next, Mickey introduces Donald Duck, who first presents an apple to Mickey in an attempt to win him over preemptively. But Donald's recitation of \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\\" ends badly as he forgets the words. Mickey rings the gong, and Donald is removed from the stage. Just as Mickey is announcing the next act, a disgruntled Donald returns to take back the apple. The next act, as introduced by Mickey, are \\"the two Claras: Cluck and Belle.\\" Clara Cluck sings a clucking version of \\"Il Bacio\\", a waltz by Luigi Arditi, accompanied by Clarabelle Cow on piano. Despite several blunders, the performance is the first to avoid the gong. Next, Donald returns to the stage wearing a disguise and carrying a violin case. Upon reaching center stage, Donald throws off the disguise and pulls a submachine gun from the case. He holds Mickey and the audience at gunpoint, determined to finish his recitation‚Äîbut again, he forgets the words. When the audience laughs at him, he opens fire and is once again removed from the stage.Some released versions of the film omitted this scene which was determined to be too violent. However, the most recent release of the film is in its original version. For the show's final act, Mickey introduces Goofy and his \\"50-piece band,\\" which turns out to be a multi-instrumental device on wheels. Goofy begins with \\"In the Good Old Summer Time\\" and moves on to \\"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\\", but the tempo and intensity of the song destroys the machine. Goofy appears out of the wreckage and sheepishly says, \\"It busted!\\" Donald ends the show by performing a rapid-fire word-perfect recitation of \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\\", satisfying his victory. However, the \\"iris out\\" effect which ends the cartoon closes on his neck. He struggles to keep it open, but it finally closes. This is a rare instance of a Disney cartoon breaking the fourth wall. History Mickey's Amateurs pokes fun at \\"amateur hour\\" radio shows which were popular entertainment in the 1930s and '40s. Perhaps the most famous example is the Major Bowes Amateur Hour in which the host, Edward Bowes, was known to strike a gong to stop an amateur performance. Mickey Mouse's repeating of the words \\"Okay, okay\\" in the film was recognized by audiences at the time as a parody of Bowes.Motion Picture Herald. June 19, 1937. The film was also inspired by the 1934 Disney film Orphan's Benefit. This film also featured a stage show with acts interspersed by Donald attempting a poetic recitation. The short movie inspired the model of the game show The Gong Show, hosted in the 70's by Chuck Barris, who have used the same method of show-host Mickey use in the short. Reception The Motion Picture Herald published a review of Mickey's Amateurs on June 19, 1937, saying, \\"The subject must be seen to be appreciated and enjoyed.

She is correctly referred to either as Agnes Wenman or as Lady Wenman. Life She was the eldest surviving daughter of Sir George Fermor of Easton Neston in Northamptonshire, by his wife Mary, daughter and heiress of Thomas Curzon. She came of a Catholic family, and was identified by the Rev. John Morris with the lady at whose house John Gerard, the Jesuit missionary, while disguised as a layman, had a keen discussion with George Abbot, the future archbishop; it was on the eternal state of a puritan who threw himself from a church steeple because he was assured of salvation. She was a friend of Mrs Elizabeth Vaux, the sister-in-law of Anne Vaux, the ally of Henry Garnet. In consequence of some correspondence between them, suspicion fell on Lady Wenman at the time of the Gunpowder Plot, and she and her husband Richard Wenman, 1st Viscount Wenman, were separately examined in December 1605. Sir Richard testified that he \\"disliked their intercourse, because Mrs. Vaux tried to pervert his wife.\\" She was set at liberty after a short confinement in custody. She was buried at Twyford on 4 July 1617. She is noted as the translator of the works of Johannes Zonaras from the French of Jean de Maulmont. The translation is preserved in manuscript.In the Cambridge University Library, in two large folio volumes, and is entitled 'The Historyes and Chronicles of the World. By John Zonaras. . . . Digested into three Books. Done out of Greek into French. . . . With Aduertisements and Index of the most memorable things ... for John Parent in Saint James Street [Rue St. Jacques, Paris], M.D.LXXXIII.

Formation  Mat of conichalcite spheres on limonite base from the Ojuela Mine, Mapim√≠, Durango, Mexico (size: 10.4 x 8.9 x 4.2 cm) Conichalcite forms in the oxidation zones of copper orebodies. Here groundwater enriched with oxygen react with copper sulfide and copper oxide to produce an array of minerals such as malachite, azurite and linarite. Conichalcite is often found encrusted on to limonitic rocks that have yellow to red colors. Conichalcite will also form a solid solution series with the mineral calciovolborthite. When these two minerals form a solid solution series, the two interchanging elements are arsenic and vanadium. Conichalcite is the arsenic rich end member of the series and calciovolborthite is the vanadium rich end member. Notable occurrences of conichalcite include Juab Co., Utah; Lincoln and Lyon counties of Nevada and Bisbee, Arizona, in the US; Durango, Mexico; Collahuasi, Tarapaca, Chile; Calstock, Cornwall and Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, England; Andalusia, Spain; and Tsumeb, Namibia.

It stretched along what is now known as Lake Sebago and Lake Kanawauke in the western part of Harriman State Park, making it the largest settlement in the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. Pine Grove Cemetery Pre-Revolutionary War era Pine Grove Cemetery, a long-forgotten plot approximately a half-acre in size once marked the center of the hamlet of Johnsontown near what is known today as Lake Sebago in the town of Stony Point. In the 1920s and 1930s this hamlet was destroyed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission by removing a dozen small communities by demolishing their homes, schools, churches, farms and businesses and turning the vacated land into forests, meadows, lakes, picnic groves and swimming facilities. The only remnants left were a handful of stone foundations indicating that buildings had once stood there and the cemetery. Presently, hundreds of descendants of those families live in nearby Stony Point, Tomkins Cove, Fort Montgomery and other adjacent communities. The cemetery consists of four or five large headstones that were actually carved by a stonemason. The remaining stones are fairly small fieldstones stuck into the ground in upright positions but with no inscriptions of any kind, meaning that there is no way to identify where most of the inhabitants are actually buried. A future goal will be to honor local resident veterans interred in the cemetery from the Revolutionary War through the War of 1812, the Civil War, Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. Thom Schassler and Florence Anderson, herself a direct descendant of the founding Johnson family and both members of the Historical Society of the Palisades Interstate Park, in 2014 placed a blue and gold metal marker which reads \\"This cemetery is in the vanished hamlet of Johnsontown, settled in circa 1750. Earliest burial date 1826. 186 stones are here.\\" Besides placing the marker, historical society members and Palisades Interstate Park System cleared the tremendous amount of underbrush and overgrowth that had virtually obliterated the ancient cemetery over the past century.

It is a sequel to 2008's Vampire Zero.  Plot summary Following her conviction at the end of Vampire Zero for stepping outside the law and torturing a convict for critical information she used to destroy her former mentor-turned-vampire, vampire hunter Laura Caxton is imprisoned in a maximum security penitentiary when it is invaded by Justinia Malvern, the world‚Äôs oldest vampire, intent on killing the former state police trooper. Malvern has used her vampiric skills to convert the prison's warden to her side, setting up the entire prison population to either accept her vampire's curse or become feeding stock for Malvern and her converts. Caxton must fight her way out of the prison and save her captured girlfriend, aided by her cellmate Gert, a meth addict who killed her children. Gert is killed during the subsequent riots, but she and Caxton are able to kill all the vampires in the prison. Although Fetlock- Caxton's replacement as head of the anti-vampire task force- believes that she has killed Justinia, Caxton goes on the run, realising that the whole crisis was set up to be just challenging enough to seem real, and that Malvern escaped during the day while the former warden- eye gouged out by Malvern to increase their resemblance- was ordered to act as her so that Caxton would believe Malvern to be dead...

They deal with family and death and hope, ‚Äúa diminishing triangle of light on the sea.‚Äù They deal with the ‚Äúwell-lit emptiness‚Äù of toasts and prayers. The music is intoxicating and, at times, fairy-talish and completely absorbing. The poems in Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum face down their ghosts ‚Äî in ‚ÄúGo‚Äù a mother's final breathes are experienced first hand, from the interior. There's bravery here and lasting wisdom. We may want such gifts from our poetry, though we seldom get them.\\" - Philip Schultz *\\"I admire the fierce attentiveness of Nadine Sabra Meyer‚Äôs poems: their formal elegance, their elegiac habit. Her subject is the body in pleasure, the body in pain, the mutable body, and the legible body. I am reminded of the care and rare mastery of such poets as Louise Bogan, Anthony Hecht, Elizabeth Bishop, and Frank Bidart. Meyer‚Äôs poems are at once intimate and complex, lyrically taut and narratively captivating.\\"- Eric Pankey *\\"Nadine Meyer is that rarest of things these days, a poet of ideas. Rarer still, she's a poet who manages to present her ideas through the manifold pleasures of a highly refinded lyrical imagination. Which is to say, her poetry demands to be taken seriously in the only way that poetry can: She makes a reader feel what it feels like to think the way she thinks. With The Anatomy Theater, Ms. Meyer takes her place in that long and illustrious line of poets whose spiritual or intellectual concerns form the core of their aesthetic program. It is a wonderfully accomplished first book of poems.\\"- Sherod Santos *\\"Nadine Sabra Meyer's Anatomy Theater is a powerful and harrowing book. In it the human figure is reduced to its primary elements --musculature, organs, bone--yet remains palable and present. The transcendent is completely exorcised, 'as thoughts decompose under anesthesia / then cease to exist.' This is a poetry without a trace of sentimentality or specious celebration, yet it remains grimly affirmative as it 'distills / from the stench of flesh, pure thought.' The language is riveting, and the lines have a sinuous complexity that is hypnotic. Meyer's unit of composition is the sentence, that is to say the thought, and she writes at a high level of tension. As the book unfolds the focus expands from the biological to the aesthetic, the personal and the historical, groping towards the possibility of escaping 'the body's domesticity for a sky both lightning struck and mute,' and of the transformation of anatomy into history. The Anatomy Theater is a stunning debut.\\"- John Koethe External links \\"cherry series round 1: NADINE MEYER / STEVE GEHRKE\\", Rice Review, October 8, 2007 *\\"The Anatomy Theater (review)\\", The Missouri Review Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:George Mason University alumni Category:University of Missouri alumni Category:George Mason University faculty Category:University of Missouri faculty Category:Seton Hall University faculty Category:Gettysburg College faculty Category:American women poets Category:21st-century American poets ","title":"Nadine Meyer"},{"id":"24021398","text":"Vampire Zero is a 2008 vampire novel written by David Wellington. Plot summary After Pennsylvania State Trooper and vampire hunter Laura Caxton's former mentor James Arkeley willingly took on the vampire curse to battle the regiment of undead Civil War-era soldiers when they were reanimated in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he promised to come back and let Laura kill him. When Arkeley reneges on his promise, Caxton is forced to hunt down the now undead U.S. Marshal. Because Arkeley was the world's premiere vampire hunter, she finds it impossible to find any clues to his whereabouts until a wannabe vampire, Dylan Carboy‚Äîa boy with an unhealthy obsession with Caxton and vampires‚Äîtries to kill her. This chance encounter leads to a reunion of sorts at the Arkeley's memorial service with his estranged family: his wife, Astarte; his daughter, Raleigh; his son, Simon; and his brother, Angus. When Caxton starts questioning the family, she quickly discovers that Arkeley is intent on offering them the vampire's curse, his now-warped psychology seeing this as the best way to reconcile his human side's love for his family and his vampire side's loathing of them. When Astarte and Angus refuse the curse, Arkeley quickly dispatches them, leaving Simon and Raleigh. Taking his offspring into protective custody, Caxton is hindered by the Arkeleys‚Äô family history, her new status as a deputized U.S. Marshal, and her new boss, Special Deputy Fetlock. Pushed to her limit of endurance when Arkeley kills his former ally and mystic Vesta Polder and turns her into a half-dead, Caxton takes Carboy out of custody and tortures him- leaving him outside in a winter road with bare feet so that he will be forced to walk home and suffer from frostbite-, until he reveals enough of his hidden relationship with Arkeley for her to learn the location of his lair. Caxton tracks the vampire to an abandoned coal mine in Centralia, Pennsylvania, a former company town all but turned into a ghost town from the underground coal fire started in the 1960s. There she is captured by Raleigh, who has accepted the vampire curse and been reanimated, and taken to Arkeley's den to be the first meal for Simon when he accepts the curse. Caxton is able to recapture her gun from Raleigh, shot and kill the vampire, and escape into the depths of the burning coal mine. Pursued by Arkeley and his half-deads, Caxton kills most of the minions but is all but crippled by Arkeley's attack. Using her own blood as bait, Caxton lures the now blood-maddened Arkeley into a side-shaft of the mine and tricks him into falling down into the burning depths. When Caxton finds her way back to the surface, carrying Simon, the only surviving member of the Arkeley family, she is immediately arrested by Fetlock for violating Carboy's constitutional rights.

Little Inc. building at 30 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near MIT, which opened in 1917 Arthur Dehon Little (December 15, 1863 - August 1, 1935) was an American chemist and chemical engineer. He founded the consulting company Arthur D. Little and was instrumental in developing chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is credited with introducing the term unit operations to chemical engineering and promoting the concept of industrial research. Life Little was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1863 and studied chemistry at MIT from 1881 to 1884.Keyes, Frederick George, (1937) Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. 71, No. 10, pp. 513‚Äì519 \\"Arthur Dehon Little (1863‚Äì1935)\\" In 1901 he married Henrietta Rogers Anthony. He died August 1, 1935 in Northeast Harbor, Maine. He was the uncle of Royal Little (1896‚Äì1989), founder and chair of Textron, and considered to be the Father of Conglomerates. Career Entrance to 30 Memorial Drive, the Arthur D. Little Inc. building In 1886, he joined Richmond Paper Company in East Providence, Rhode Island as a chemist, later becoming superintendent of a paper mill, and effectively recognised that the chemical engineering design was wrong: by correcting this, he came to his first patent. Further research and patents followed, mainly related to paper processing technology. Little left and formed his own company. He was joined by a colleague from Richmond Paper, Roger Griffin forming a new company in 1886, Little & Griffin, which was located in Boston where MIT was also located. Griffin and Little prepared a manuscript for The Chemistry of Paper-making which was for many years an authoritative text in the area. The book had not been entirely finished when Griffin was killed in a laboratory accident in 1893. After this tragedy, Little carried on in the business alone for a number of years. During these years he founded the Cellulose Products Company demonstrating that cellulose acetate could be used in producing nonflammable wire insulation and artificial silk. The company didn't do well financially, and when it was dissolved, Eastman Kodak purchased the company's patents for the first nonflammable motion picture film and the Lustron Company bought the artificial silk patents becoming the only American manufacturer of acetate silk. He collaborated with MIT and William Hultz Walker of the MIT Chemistry department, forming a partnership, Little & Walker, which lasted from 1900 to 1905, while both MIT and Little's company were still located in Boston. The partnership dissolved in 1905 when Walker dedicated his full-time to being in charge of the new Research Laboratory of Applied Chemistry at MIT. Little continued on his own and formally incorporated the company, Arthur D. Little (ADL), in 1909. He conducted analytical studies, the precursor of the consulting studies for which the firm would later become famous. As chairman of the Visiting Committee of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at MIT he was responsible for the introduction of the Chemical Engineering Practice School. He also taught papermaking at MIT from 1893 to 1916. Honors Little was President of the American Chemical Society for 1912‚Äì1914, and President of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers for 1919, and President of the Society of Chemical Industry 1928‚Äì29. In 1931, he was awarded the Perkin Medal.

The episode was written and directed by the series developers, Greg Weisman and Victor Cook. In the episode, Spider-Man (Josh Keaton) faces the evil Vulture (Robert Englund) as he begins his junior year in high school. Sony Entertainment originally conceived The Spectacular Spider-Man as a series of four DVDs, and asked Weisman and Cook to develop it. The central idea was to follow Spider-Man in his younger years in the comics; Weisman and Cook wanted to incorporate the styles of the early comic publications by Lee and Ditko. Reviewers have cited other influences in the themes, such as the live action film series and the Ultimate Spider-Man continuity. \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" originally aired on March 8, 2008, on the Kids' WB block on The CW. It had previously been shown to a large audience at the 2008 WonderCon. The episode was the highest rated program of the Kids WB! 2007-2008 combined with the second episode \\"Interactions\\" and alone received a Nielsen rating of 1.2/3. It was well received by critics, IGN calling it \\"a Spider-Man story that feels like classic Spider-Man, and that's a good thing.\\" Plot The night before school starts, Spider-Man, alter ego of Peter Parker (Josh Keaton), foils an attempted bank robbery; in the background, a shadowed figure (Keith David) tells his henchman Hammerhead (John DiMaggio) to summon the Enforcers to kill Spider-Man. The next day, an aerodynamic engineer named Adrian Toomes (Robert Englund) is outraged at OsCorp for stealing his anti-gravity project, viciously berating Dr. Otto Octavius (Peter MacNicol) until Norman Osborn (Alan Rachins) arrives. Osborn dismisses Toomes, calling him a failure and a buzzard before he has him escorted out by security. Toomes turns to Octavius and declares that he no longer blames him for the theft of his work. Meanwhile, Peter arrives at school and tells his friends Gwen Stacy (Lacey Chabert) and Harry Osborn (James Arnold Taylor) that he is determined to get a date with Sally Avril, though both she and Flash Thompson (Joshua LeBar) humiliate him in front of everyone. After school, Peter and Gwen are offered an internship at Dr. Connor's lab, where the former was given his superpowers; both accept. Peter goes to Harry's apartment, where Norman congratulates him on his newfound career. Toomes, going by the name \\"the Vulture,\\" breaks in wearing a suit with built-in metallic wings and talons, with his anti-gravity technology incorporated to it and kidnaps Norman. Peter slips out to don the Spider-Man costume and pursues Vulture. He succeeds in rescuing Norman but loses to Vulture in a fight. Later, Peter goes to the lab where he meets up with Gwen, his close friend Eddie Brock (Benjamin Diskin), and the Conners. When he finds out he will not be paid for the internship, he tries to sell pictures to the Daily Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson (Daran Norris), though he is kicked out near immediately. That night, Norman is attacked by the Vulture once more and when Spider-Man tries to stop him, he is fired upon by the Enforcers, who distract him while Vulture chases after Norman's limousine. While being pursued by the Enforcers, he follows after Vulture and ends up defeating him while getting the assassins off his back. When he returns home, his Aunt May (Deborah Strang) gives him a curfew to ensure he doesn't come home late again and gives him a slice of pie. Production Greg Weisman wrote \\"Survival of the Fittest\\". The Spectacular Spider-Man was originally conceived by Sony Entertainment as a series of four animated DVDs that chronicled the Spider-Man character in his youth. The company brought in Victor Cook and Greg Weisman to help with development. Weisman had had critical success with the series Gargoyles, while Cook worked on the Hellboy animated features. They both had been Spider-Man fans for decades, as well. Weisman wanted to incorporate the early stages of the comic when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko where the character was in his younger stages; Cook agreed because he had yet to see it done before in any type of adaptation for the character. Other influences on the style were the Ultimate Spider-Man comics and the live action film adaptions of the comic publications. When the idea was changed to an animated television series, they still kept a similar chronicle style where \\"each episode stands alone as its own story, but like the comic book itself it's a saga. Then each three episodes is a story and those three episodes are what would be on the DVD releases.\\" The original title for the series was The Amazing Spider-Man, based on the Spider-Man comic publication of the same name. In mid-2007, the title was changed to The Spectacular Spider-Man, as well a Spider-Man comic series. Weisman prepared for his role as a story editor of the new series by going out and purchasing the first seven volumes of The Essential Spider-Man, which he had previously read as a child. he re- read them in order to \\"get the voice of those early stories\\" and took extensive notes. The show was given a specific budget, so Weisman and Cook wanted to allow the animation to \\"move\\" more than anything, giving it simple and stylistic designs. Sam Raimi, director of the Spider-Man live action films, \\"set the bar\\" for the fluent movement styles Spider-Man has, which Weisman and Cook were in complete agreement of incorporating into the series. When designing the Vulture, the two employed the dark green shades from his original design, a color which they use thematically for most of their villains and other negative aspects of Peter's life, along with touches of blood-like red. His wings were employed in the same style that his comic book counterpart; \\"[They are] for steering[...]they don't keep him air born,\\" Weisman describes. Vulture was voiced by Robert Englund, iconic for his portrayal as the horror film character Freddy Krueger. \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" was written by Weisman and directed by Cook. The episode originally aired on March 8, 2008, on the Kids WB! block for The CW network. It had previously been shown to a packed audience at the 2008 WonderCon; several goers were forced to stand and the creators and other members of the crew took the stage to answer questions. When Disney XD premiered the series, it aired the episode, along with the following two, \\"Interactions\\" and \\"Natural Selection,\\" on March 23, 2009. Cultural references \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" follows a title scheme given by Weisman that follows \\"The Education of Peter Parker.\\" For the episode and beginning arc of season one, the titles are based on Biology. The scene in the episode in which Spider-Man catches Norman Osborn in mid-air and makes several sarcastic comments to Vulture, such as \\"You guys play hot potato hardcore!\\" and \\"He may be right. I only rent [the skies],\\" were described by Comic Mix reviewer Alan Kistler as in the attitude of Bugs Bunny. Reception Robert Englund was praised for his performance in the episode. In its original broadcast, \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" received a Nielsen rating of 1.2/3, which is considered high for American television. The rating was the top mark for the 10:00 a.m. timeslot for the 2007-2008 season and was a 20% increase of the previous week's. In key kids 2-11, it received a rating of 1.4/5, a 25% increase from the previous week's mark in the demographic. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from critics. IGN reviewer Eric Goldman gave the episode an eight out of ten rating, commenting that it was \\"literally jam-packed with classic Spider-Man characters\\" and \\"a Spider-Man story that feels like classic Spider-Man.\\" Goldman praised the 1960s-inspired style and described the humor as both \\"corny\\" and \\"legitimately,\\" along with the fight sequences. Goldman enjoyed the fight sequences where Spider-Man faces the Vulture and Fancy Dan and gave \\"kodos\\" to the sound design teams for the \\"distinctive\\" noises made by Vulture's motors, along with the animation style. Sean Elliot, senior edit of iF Magazine, gave \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" an \\"A\\"; Elliot wrote that it was \\"a Spider-man cartoon that's for all ages and ranges.\\" Elliot said that he enjoyed the usage of several different Spider-Man villains to the point of watching the episode twice. Though the Vulture is not a favorite of Elliot's, he commented that the episode made him seem \\"pretty cool;\\" he went on to praise the voice cast, including Englund's performance as Vulture.

Plot Marcus Superbus, a Roman patrician under Nero, falls in love with a young woman (Mercia) and converts to Christianity for her. Poppea, Nero's wife, is in unrequited lust for Marcus. At the end, Mercia and Marcus sacrifice their lives in the arena to the lions. Comparison to Quo Vadis Much of the plot of Quo Vadis is similar, as far as both featuring main characters named Marcus, against the same historic setting. The ending is in complete contrast to Quo Vadis, in which Marcus (Vinicius not Superbus) and Lygia (not Mercia) survive and presumably live happily ever after, and Nero and Poppea are the ones who die.

Friction existed between the two sides from the beginning of World War I. The unconditional surrender of the border fortress of Rupel in May 1916 to the Central Powers' forces, mainly composed of Bulgarian troops, was the first event that led to the Noemvriana. The Allies feared the possibility of a secret pact between the Greek royalist government and the Central Powers. Such an alliance would endanger the Allied army in Macedonia bivouacking around Thessalonica since the end of 1915. Intensive diplomatic negotiations between King Constantine I and Allied diplomats took place throughout the summer. The king wanted Greece to maintain her neutrality, a position that would favor the Central Powers plans in the Balkans while the Allies wanted demobilization of the Greek army and the surrender of war materiel equivalent to what was lost at Fort Rupel as a guarantee of Greece's neutrality. By the end of the summer of 1916, the failure of negotiations, along with the Bulgarian army's advance in eastern Macedonia and the Greek government's orders for the Greek army not to offer resistance, led to a military coup by Venizelist military officers in Thessaloniki with the support of the Allies. The former Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who from the very beginning supported the Allies, established a provisional government in northern Greece. He began forming an army to liberate areas lost to Bulgaria, but this effectively split Greece into two entities. The inclusion of the Greek army along with Allied forces, as well as the division of Greece, sparked several anti-Allied demonstrations in Athens. In late October, a secret agreement was reached between the king and the Allied diplomats. The pressure from the military advisers forced the king to abandon this agreement. In an attempt to enforce their demands, the Allies landed a small contingent in Athens on . However, it met organized resistance and an armed confrontation took place until a compromise was reached at the end of the day. The day after the Allied contingent evacuated from Athens, a royalist mob began rioting throughout the city, targeting supporters of Venizelos. The rioting continued for three days, and the incident became known as the Noemvriana in Greece, which in the Old Style calendar occurred during the month of November. The incident drove a deep wedge between the Venizelists and the royalists, bringing closer what would become known as the National Schism.Leon, 1974, pp. 424‚Äì436 Following the Noemvriana, the Allies, determined to remove Constantine I, established a naval blockade to isolate areas which supported the king. After the resignation of the king on 15 June 1917, Greece unified under a new king, Alexander, Constantine I's son, and the leadership of Eleftherios Venizelos. It joined World War I on the side of the Allies. By 1918, the mobilized Greek army provided the numerical superiority the Allies needed on the Macedonian front. The Allied army shortly thereafter defeated the Central Powers forces in the Balkans, followed by the liberation of Serbia and the conclusion of World War I. Background Conference of Bucharest that ended the Balkan Wars. Greece emerged victorious after the 1912‚Äì1913 Balkan Wars, with her territory almost doubled. The unstable international political climate of the early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I. Greece, like Bulgaria, initially maintained neutrality during the conflict. The Greek leadership was divided between the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who supported Great Britain on the side of the Allies and King Constantine who was educated in Germany and married to the Kaiser's sister. The king admired Prussian militarism and was anticipating a quick German victory. The king wanted Greece to remain neutral in the conflict, a strategy favorable to Germany and the Central Powers. In early 1915, Britain offered Greece \\"territorial concessions in Asia Minor\\" if it would participate in the upcoming Gallipoli Campaign. Venizelos supported this idea, while the king and his military advisers opposed it. Dismayed at the king's opposition, the prime minister resigned on 21 February 1915. A few months later, Venizelos' Liberal Party won the May elections, and formed a new government. When Bulgaria mobilized against Serbia in September 1915, Venizelos ordered a Greek counter- mobilization and asked the Anglo-French army to defend Thessaloniki and aid Serbia. The Allies, led by General Maurice Sarrail, began landing on 22 September 1915 and entrenched around the city. The Greek parliament gave Venizelos a vote of confidence to help Serbia, yet the king unconstitutionally dismissed the prime minister along with the parliament. This unlawful order escalated the animosity between the king and Venizelos as well as their loyal followers.Chester, 1921, p. 271Kitromilides, 2006, pp. 121‚Äì2 The Liberals boycotted the December elections. Causes Surrender of Fort Rupel King Constantine I dressed as a German Field Marshal. His German sympathies caused him to favor a course of neutrality in the First World War. On 9 May 1916, the Chief of the General Staff of the Central Powers, Erich von Falkenhayn informed Athens of the imminent advance of German-Bulgarian forces. In reply, Athens minimized the importance of General Sarrail's movements and requested Falkenhayn to change his strategy.Leon, 1974, p. 355 On 23 May, Falkenhayn guaranteed that the territorial integrity of Greece and the rights of its citizens would be respected. On 26 May, despite an official protest by the Greek government, 25,000 Bulgarian soldiers led by German cavalry invaded Greece. The Greek forces at Fort Rupel surrendered.Leon, 1974, pp. 356‚Äì7 The German Supreme Command was concerned about Allied General Sarrail's movements and Falkenhayn was ordered to occupy strategic positions inside Greek territory, specifically Fort Rupel.Leon, 1974, p. 354 Despite the assurances of Falkenhayn, Bulgarian soldiers immediately began to forcibly centralize the Greek population into large cities, namely Serres, Drama and Kavala. German attempts to restrain Bulgarian territorial ambitions were partially successful, yet on 4 September, Kavala was occupied by the Bulgarian army.Leon, 1974, p. 381 Reactions of Venizelos and the Allies The surrender of Fort Rupel caused the Allies to believe that the German-Bulgarian advance was a result of a secret agreement between Athens and the Central Powers, as they were assured that no Bulgarian force would invade Greek territory. The Allies saw this as a violation of Greek neutrality and a disturbance in the balance of power in the Balkans. The Allied press, especially in France, demanded swift military action against Greece to protect the Allied forces in Macedonia.Leon, 1974, p. 361 For Venizelos and his supporters, the surrender of Fort Rupel signaled the loss of Greek Macedonia. On 29 May, Venizelos proposed to Sir Francis Elliot (senior British diplomat in Athens) and Jean Guillemin (senior French diplomat in Athens) that he and General Panagiotis Danglis should establish a provisional government in Thessaloniki to mobilize the Greek army to repel the Bulgarians. Venizelos pledged that the army would not move against the king and the royal family. According to Elliot's report, Venizelos hoped that the \\"success of his action and pressure of the public opinion might at the last moment convert His Majesty\\". The proposal had French support. However it met with strong opposition from Britain, forcing Venizelos to abandon the plan.Leon, 1974, p. 363 On 9 June the Allies held a conference in London to examine the reasons behind the quick surrender of Fort Rupel and favored a complete demobilization of the Greek army and navy.Leon, 1974, p. 368 King Constantine anticipated the results of the conference and ordered a partial demobilization on 8 June. The tension between the royal government and the Allies continued since 'anti- Allied activities' in Athens were ignored by the Greek Government. On 12‚Äì13 June, a mob destroyed Venizelist newspapers: Nea Ellas, Patris, Ethnos, and Estia. The mob proceeded to the British Embassy as police idly stood by without interfering.Leon, 1974, p. 369 This incident gave France the political ammunition to persuade Britain that more extreme measures were needed. On 17 June, the London conference decided \\"that it was absolutely necessary to do something to bring the king of Greece and his Government to their senses\\".Leon, 1974, p. 370 Military coup of Thessaloniki The \\"Triumvirate of National Defence\\": (L-R) Admiral Kountouriotis, Venizelos, and General Danglis On 27 August 1916, during a demonstration in Athens, Venizelos explained his disagreements with the king's policies. Venizelos said that the king became a victim of his advisers, whose aims were to destroy the goals of the Goudi revolution. Additionally, Venizelos appealed to the king to pursue a policy of benevolence and true neutrality. Venizelos ended his speech by stating that \\"if this proposal does not lead to success then there are other means to protect the country from complete catastrophe\\".Leon, 1974, p. 384 The king refused to accept any compromise including meeting with a committee sent by Venizelos. Two days later, army officers loyal to Venizelos organized a military coup in Thessaloniki and proclaimed the \\"Provisional Government of National Defence\\". Despite the support of the army, the provisional government was not officially recognized by Venizelos nor the Allied powers. Venizelos criticized this course of action, noting that without the support of the Allied army, the movement would fail immediately.Leon, 1974, p. 388-9 This further polarized the population between the royalists (also known as anti- Venizelists), and Venizelists. The newly founded separate \\"provisional state\\" included Northern Greece, Crete and the Aegean Islands.Clogg, 2002, p. 87 The \\"New Lands\\", won during the Balkan Wars, broadly supported Venizelos, while the \\"Old Greece\\" was mostly pro-royalist. Venizelos, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis and General Panagiotis Danglis formed a triumvirate provisional government and on 9 October moved to Thessaloniki to assume command of the National Defense. They directed Greek participation in the Allied war effort in direct conflict with the royal wishes in Athens.Kitromilides, 2008, p. 124 According to a British diplomat: From the very beginnings, Venizelos continued his appeals to the king to join forces to jointly liberate Macedonia.Leon, 1974, p. 417 Venizelos wrote: Venizelos' moderation did not convince many citizens, even among his own followers. It was only after the end of 1916 and the \\"Noemvriana\\" that he pushed for a radical solution to end the stalemate.Leon, 1974, p. 418 Constantine‚ÄìB√©nazet agreement French politician Paul B√©nazet. After the creation of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected.Leon, 1974, p. 422 After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul B√©nazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers. On 3 November, Vice- admiral du Fournet, commander-in-chief of the allied Mediterrean fleet, used the sinking of two Greek merchant ships by a German submarine, as well as the secret agreement, to demand the surrender of the docked Greek war ships and took command of the Salamis naval arsenal.Leon, 1974, p. 423 The Greek government yielded, and on 7 November,Leon, 1974, p. 428 the partial disarmament of Greek warships began. The Allies towed away 30 lighter craft.Markezinis, 1968, p. 4/175 Three weeks later the French took over the Salamis naval base completely, and began using Greek ships operated by French crews.Fotakis, 2005, p. 131Burg, 1998, p. 140Paxton, 2008, p. 166 The Constantine‚ÄìB√©nazet agreement was short-lived due to Venizelos' military plans as well as pressure exerted by the military in Athens, led by the king, regarding the forced Greek disarmament.Leon, 1974, p. 424 The army of the Defence confronted against the royalist army at Katerini (and by January 1917 had taken the control of Thessaly). This action at Katerini met with some disapproval among the Allied circles and among his own associates in Athens. Answering these criticisms Venizelos wrote to A. Diamandidis: The Venizelist advance was not an attempt to undermine the king's pact with B√©nazet, since it had been planned long before that. The failure of the secret agreement was caused by subversive activities within segments of the royalist government in Athens to paralyze and disrupt the Thessaloniki provisional government. Last diplomatic efforts before the events The seizure of Greek ships by the Allies, the Katerini incident and the Franco-British violations of Greece's territorial integrity offended the national honor of a segment of \\"Old Greece\\" and increased the king's popularity. The king refused to honor his secret agreement with B√©nazet and soldiers who requested to fight against the Bulgarian occupation were charged with \\"desertion to the rebels\\".Leon, 1974, p. 430 A growing movement amongst the low rank officers within the army, led by Ioannis Metaxas and Sofoklis Dousmanis, were determined to oppose disarmament and any assistance to the Allies. French vice-admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet. Diplomacy failed despite continuing pressure applied by the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a seven-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender of at least ten Greek mountain artillery batteries.Leon, 1974, p. 434 Du Fournet was instructed not to use force to take possession of the batteries. The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, as well as the army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.Leon, 1974, p. 435 Despite the gravity of the situation, both the royalist government and the Allies made no serious effort to reach a diplomatic solution. On 29 November, the royalist government rejected the proposal of the Allies and armed resistance was organized. By 30 November military units and royalist militia (the epistratoi, \\"reservists\\") from surrounding areas had been recalled and gathered in and around Athens (in total over 20,000 menChester, 1921, p. 293Seligman, 1920, p. 139Ion, 1918, pp. 796‚Äì812) and occupied strategic positions, with orders not to fire unless fired upon. The Allied commanders failed in their assessment of the situation, disregarding Greek national pride and determination, causing them to conclude that the Greeks were bluffing. The Allies thought that in the face of a superior force, Greeks would \\"bring the cannons on a plater\\" (surrender); a viewpoint that Du Fournet also shared. The battle of Athens: 1916 The French battleship Mirabeau bombarding Athens during the November events. Acropolis in the background, during the Noemvriana. French troops with machine guns in Athens. On early morning of the Allies landed a 3,000Abbot, 1922, p. 159-strong marine force in Piraeus, and headed towards Athens.Kitromilides, 2006, p. 125Markezinis, 1968, p. 175 When the Allied troops reached their designated positions, they found them already occupied by Greek troops. For more than two hours both sides stood facing each other. Some time in the morning, an unknown origin rifle shot was fired and the battle of Athens began. Each side blamed the other for firing first. Once the battle spread throughout the city, the king requested a ceasefire proposing a solution and reach a compromise. Du Fournet, with a small contingent of troops was unprepared to encounter organized Greek resistance, and was already short of supplies, so readily accepted the king's compromise. However, before an agreement was finalized, the battle resumed. The Greek battery from Arditos Hill fired a number of rounds at the entrance of Zappeion where the French admiral had established his headquarters. The Allied squadron from Phaliron responded by bombarding sections of the city, mostly around the Stadium and near the Palace. Discussions soon were resumed and a final compromise was reached. The king compromised to surrender just six artillery batteries camouflaged in the mountains instead of the ten that the Allied Admiral demanded.Leon, 1974, p. 436Abbot, 1922, p. 160 By late afternoon the battle was finished. The Allies had suffered 194 casualties, dead and wounded, and the Greeks lost 82, not counting civilians.Clogg, 2002, p. 89 By early morning of 2 December, all Allied forces had been evacuated. The role of the Venizelists during the battle has been intensely contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report that he had been involved in a civil war. The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day, when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens.Abbot, 1922, p. 161 Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.Karolidis, 1925, VI, 248‚Äì249 The following days Venizelist victims in Athens after the events The authorities, with the pretext of the events, claimed that the Venelizelists had staged an insurrection with the support of Allied troops and proceeded with the help of the Reservists to extensive arrests and reprisals against the city's Venizelists. The entire operation was led by two generals of the army; troops of the military district of Athens took orders from General K. Kallaris and the soldiers of the active defense were commanded by General A. Papoulas (later commander-in-chief of the Asia Minor expedition).Koliopoulos, 2009, p. 82 The terror and destruction that followed soon went out of hand, making even the respectable conservative newspaper Politiki Epitheorisis (, Political Review) that at the beginning urged Greek \\"justice\\" to \\"smite mercifully the atrocious conspiracy\\" and to purge all followers of the \\"archconspirator of Salonika [Venizelos]\\", in the end to urge \\"prudence\\".Leon, 1974, pp. 436‚Äì7 During the following three days houses and shops of Venizelists were ransacked and 35 people were murdered. Chester says that most of those who were murdered were refugees from Asia Minor.Chester, 1921, p. 294 Many hundreds were imprisoned and kept in solitary confinement. Karolidis characterizes the imprisonment of certain prominent Venizelists, such as Emmanuel Benakis (mayor of Athens), as a disgrace. Some authors argue that Benakis was not only arrested and imprisoned but also disrespected and ill-treated. Seligman describes that they were only released 45 days later after a strong demand contained within the Entente ultimatum, which was accepted on 16 January.Seligman, 1920, p. 140 Opposing reports also exist, e.g. Abbot asserts that during the evacuation of the Allied forces, many \\"criminals\\" and \\"collaborators\\" on the payrolls of different Allied spy agencies slipped out of Athens at night after allegedly \\"terrorizing the city for nearly a year\\". Due to his failure Vice-admiral Dartige du Fournet was relieved of his command.Markezinis, 1968, p. 4/179 Aftermath In Greece, this incident became known as Noemvriana (November events), using the Old Style calendar, and marked the culmination of the National Schism. Political situation in Greece and Europe On , Britain and France officially recognized Venizelos government as the only lawful government of Greece, effectively splitting the country.Burg, 1998, pp. 145‚Äì6 On , Venizelos' government officially declared war on the Central Powers.Vatikotes, 1998 p. 98Burg, 1998, p. 145 Mainwhile in Athens Constantine praised his generals. There were also in circulation various pro-royalist and religious brochures calling Venizelos \\"traitor\\" and \\"Senegalese goat\\". A royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was issued and the Archbishop of Athens, pressured by the royal house,Kitromilides, 2006, p. 367 anathematised the prime ministerHickey, 2004, p. 87 (in a special ceremony with the crowd throwing stones to an effigy of Venizelos). In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, a leading proponent of engaging with Constantine to bring about a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government.Dutton, 1998, pp. 110‚Äì113 In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.Clogg, 2002, p. 89 The fall of the Romanovs in Russia (who refused the French proposals for Constantine's removal from the throne), caused France and Great Britain to take more drastic measures against King Constantine. In June they decided to invoke their obligation as \\"protecting powers\\" and demanded the king's resignation.Gibbons, 1920, p. 299 Charles Jonnart said to Constantine: \\"The Germans burned my native town, Arras. I will not hesitate to burn Athens\\". Constantine accepted and on 15 June 1917 went into exile. His son Alexander, who was considered to have Allies sympathies, became the new King of Greece instead of Constantine's elder son and crown prince, George.Chester, 1921, pp. 295‚Äì304Land of Invasion, TIME, 4 November 1940 The king's exile was followed by the deportation of many prominent royalist officers and politicians considered pro-Germans, such as Ioannis Metaxas and Dimitrios Gounaris, to France and Italy. The course of events paved the way for Venizelos to return to Athens on 29 May 1917. Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies. The entire Greek army was mobilized (though tensions remained inside the army between supporters of the Constantine and supporters of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers on the Macedonian front.

By the fall of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest component of the Allied army on the Macedonian front.Chester, 1921, p. 311 The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance between the two sides on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After the first serious battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece a seat at the Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos.Chester, 1921, pp. 312‚Äì3 See also *The Great War Notes Footnotes References ; Books         ; Journals * External links * Category:1916 in Greece Category:1916 riots Category:Constantine I of Greece Category:Ioannis Metaxas Category:Macedonian front Category:Military history of Athens Category:Military history of Greece during World War I Category:Modern history of Athens Category:Political riots Category:Riots and civil disorder in Greece ","title":"Noemvriana"},{"id":"24021703","text":"Corcovado is a mountain in central Rio de Janeiro.

Oklahoma State University The Gidran breed began its development in 1816 at the Mezohegyes State Stud. The original foundation sire was a desert bred Arabian stallion named Siglavy Gidran. This stallion was crossed on Arabian, Turkish, and Spanish-Naples mares as well as other local mares from eastern Europe. Beginning in 1893, Thoroughbred bloodlines were added. Later, Shagya Arabian breeding was also added. The breed influenced or was crossed on many other breeds in eastern Europe, including the Czech warm blood, Austrian Warmblood, Hungarian Warmblood, Malapolski, Nonius, Pleven, and the Ukrainian Riding Horse. It is closely associated with another Hungarian breed, the Kisber Felver. A study in 2016 of the Gidran showed that the remaining small population of horses has more genetic diversity than expected, which improves the breed's chances of not becoming extinct.  Characteristics  Gidrans stand between .

Background  The Essential Connie Smith contains twenty tracks of material that Smith had recorded for RCA Records. Of the tracks, nineteen were singles (\\"How Great Thou Art\\" was the only exception), including Smith's biggest hit, \\"Once a Day\\", which spent eight weeks at #1 on the Billboard Country Chart in 1964 and 1965.

The son of Chauncey Thomas, a farmer and entrepreneur, who built four bridges across the Delaware River at Shohola Glen, Pennsylvania, Thomas Jr., graduated from the United States Naval Academy third in the class of 1871. He was the Commander of the United States Pacific Fleet when he retired in 1912. He died at the age of 69 in Pacific Grove, California. The Albatross expedition Chauncey Thomas, as captain, commanded the US Fish Commission steamer, during a scientific expedition in the Hawaiian Islands and southern Pacific in 1902. Orders issued at the onset of the expedition made it unclear where ultimate authority in the expedition lay, with the ship's captain, or the scientist-in-charge, Charles Henry Gilbert (1859‚Äì1929). Before leaving port, Thomas requested clarification, which he received, confirming the norm: that the ship's captain always had ultimate authority regarding the safety of the crew and the ship. The expedition proceeded, but was marred by a barrage of complaints that pitted the scientific crew against the ship's crew, and was characterized by lengthy letters. Career Thomas held a variety of commands in the United States Navy. For 27 months, he was commander of the gunboat , which cruised in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of North and South America Alaskan ports in the summer of 1903 and the coast of Central America the following fall and winter. Rear Admiral As commander of the Second Squadron of the Pacific Fleet, he relieved Rear Admiral Edward B. Barry as Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet in January 1911 upon orders of the Naval Department. Admiral Barry was forced to resign after an alleged affair with a cabin boy. Family and residence In 1895, Chauncey Thomas purchased the property known as Hitching Post Hill, an early 19th-century horse farm in Prince George's County, Maryland. Namesake Camp Thomas, formed in 1910 as a base for the 4th Marine Regiment, was named for him. The Regiment was deployed there against the possibility of the disorder in Mexico spreading to Southern California. Camp Thomas disbanded in June, 1911.

From 2010 through 2016, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, Oakland Athletics, and New York Yankees. Davis led his high school team to three straight Arizona state championships as a pitcher and first baseman. As a hitter he batted .447, while as a pitcher he recorded a 23‚Äì0 win‚Äìloss record, a 1.85 earned run average (ERA), and 14 saves. He also pitched for the gold medal-winning U.S.A. Youth National Team in the 2003 World Youth Championships, and was the most valuable player of the 2004 AFLAC All-American High School Baseball Classic. Ranked second in the nation as a freshman for Arizona State University by both Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball, he was named Pac-10 Conference Freshman of the Year, as he became the first freshman ever to lead the conference in runs batted in (RBIs). He hit .353 with a .605 slugging percentage in college, threw a fastball that reached 94 miles per hour, and was a two-time All-American and a three-time All-Pac-10 selection. Davis was drafted 18th overall in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft. In the minor leagues, he batted .288 with a .371 on-base percentage (OBP), and a .467 slugging percentage, and was the Mets 2009 Organizational Player of the Year. The Mets called him up to the majors in April 2010. His 11 home runs prior to the All-Star break that season tied him for the second-most ever by a Mets rookie. He set the Mets rookie record for total bases (230), and tied the Mets rookie records for bases on balls (72) and extra-base hits (53). He was named the first baseman on Baseball Americas 2010 All-Rookie Team. During a 2011 season shortened by an ankle injury, Davis batted .302. In 2012, he batted .227, but his 32 home runs were 5th-best in the National League. In 2013, he split his time between the Mets and AAA Las Vegas. He was traded to the Pirates in April 2014, and traded to the Athletics after the season. He played for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Early years Davis was born in Edina, Minnesota, to Millie (n√©e Gollinger) Davis and Ron Davis. His father was a major league pitcher who pitched in 481 games in the majors in his 11-year career. His father was a power relief pitcher, and an American League All-Star in 1981. He pitched from 1978 to 1988, starting with the New York Yankees (1978‚Äì81, going 27‚Äì10 with 22 saves, primarily as the setup man for Rich Gossage). He pitched for the Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Francisco Giants. His father retired at the age of 32 in 1988, however, so Ike remembers more from old-timers' games, such as the one where, at age 12, he met Derek Jeter. He and his father are the 197th father-son combination to have both played in the major leagues. Ike went to Cocopah Middle School. He took the baseball team to two straight state championships. He set a school record with 18 home runs in one season and 3 in one game. A field there was later named after him. Davis is Jewish through his mother. His mother, the youngest daughter of Bernard and Harriet Gollinger, is Jewish, and his father is Baptist. Davis embraces both sides of his family‚Äôs ancestry. His mother's family was from Lithuania and immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. Of those who stayed behind, most of her family were murdered in The Holocaust during World War II.Heading Home: Team Israel‚Äôs Magic Carpet Ride Jewish Week Davis had a great aunt on his mother‚Äôs side who was a Holocaust survivor. Davis said: \\"She was the one who knew everything that happened. She was able to come to the United States, and she brought the story with her.\\" Davis' paternal grandfather was an American paratrooper in the United States Army who landed in France on D-Day in 1944. He later helped liberate one of the Nazi concentration camps. Davis' given names are Isaac and Benjamin (after his mother's grandfathers). Davis does not practice Judaism and is non-religious,Adam Rubin, ESPN New York: \\"Ike Davis to play on Yom Kippur\\" September 16, 2010New York Times: \\"Davis Shares His Family's Holocaust History: September 27, 2010 but he stated: \\"I am really proud of my Jewish heritage.\\" He describes himself as \\"culturally Jewish.\\" He reflected: \\"It's funny about Judaism; It doesn‚Äôt matter if you're ultra- religious or not, as long as you know that it's in you or you're a part of it, everyone accepts you.\\" He often uses the Jewish greeting \\"shalom\\". Davis says: \\"I'm glad Jewish kids get to see they can grow up to be professional baseball players.\\" Davis follows four other players of Jewish ancestry on the Mets: Art Shamsky, Shawn Green, Scott Schoeneweis, and Josh Satin. As a youth, he attended a five-day baseball fundamentals camp that his father continues to run for children ages 5‚Äì14. His father was also his little league coach until Davis was 14. His father said: > People would say Ike was good because his dad was a player. But it's not > that easy.... I can tell Ike how to swing, I can teach him to pitch, [teach] > the game of baseball, but he's the only one to make it to the big leagues. > You can't teach heart and soul. That's what it takes to play in the game. High school Davis attended Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he won three state titles (2003‚Äì05). His father would throw him batting practice. He hit .559 as a sophomore, the school record, ahead of Paul Konerko's .558 in 1994. He also hit a school-record 23 doubles, breaking Konerko's record of 18. He followed that up by batting .425 as a junior (when he was also Arizona 4A Pitcher of the Year), and .450 as a senior. As a senior, he had a 92‚Äì93 mph fastball, to complement his changeup and slider. He was ranked 12th in the country by Baseball America, and was a high school All- American. In 2003, he also pitched for the U.S.A. Youth National Team (16-under) in international play. They won the gold medal in the International Baseball Federation XI \\"AA\\" World Youth Championships in Taiwan. In 2004, he played on the U.S.A. Junior National Team (18-under). In his two seasons playing for Team U.S.A., he batted .404. In 2004, he was one of 40 players from across the country chosen to play in the AFLAC All-American High School Baseball Classic. He won the MVP Award for the game, hitting the go-ahead home run for his team. The following year, he was MVP in the all star 2005 High School American Game. By November 2004, the 17-year-old Davis was already and 194 pounds. In 2005, despite his having indicated he was going to go to college, he was drafted in the 19th round by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He elected not to sign. Davis graduated from high school with a .447 batting average in 320 at bats, with 48 doubles (a school record, ahead of Konerko's 44), 12 home runs, and 106 runs batted in (RBIs) (third in school history).

In October 2005, he was ranked the # 2 freshman in the nation by both Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball. He pitched (as the team's Friday night starter; the role given the \\"ace\\" of a college rotation), was the designated hitter, and played first base and corner outfield. In March 2006, he was named a Louisville Slugger National Player of the Week, Pac-10 Conference Player of the Week, and College Baseball Foundation National Honor Roll Player of the Week for a week in which he batted .588 and drove in 13 runs, in four games.

Sophomore year (2007) Davis demonstrated his versatility in an April 2007 game. He came to the mound with his team trailing 5‚Äì4, ended the inning by striking out a batter, and in the next half-inning stole home as the lead runner in a triple steal. For his sophomore season, he primarily played right field (batting .349 with 23 doubles‚Äîtied for the conference lead‚Äîand 61 RBIs, in 62 games) and pitched as a middle reliever (sporting a 1.35 ERA). He again received First-Team All-Pac-10 honors, and was named a Collegiate Baseball Louisville Slugger Third Team All-American, a National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) Third-Team All- American, and again a Jewish Sports Review First-Team All-American.

In consecutive weeks in March 2008 he was named both the Louisville Slugger National Player of the Week and the Pac-10 Conference Player of the Week. In the first week he hit .450 and struck out all four batters he faced. In the second week he batted .529 with a 1.412 slugging percentage, and recorded five outs from the mound, four by strikeout, without giving up a hit.

On the mound, he ended his college career as the Sun Devils closer, and totaled a 7‚Äì5 mark with 4 saves and 78 strikeouts in his career. Davis was also a part of two Pac-10 Championship teams, and went to the College World Series in 2007. He was named to the ASU All-Decade team. Scouts felt he was at his best as a batter when he used the whole field. They noted that his bat speed allowed him to wait on pitches and drive them the other way, and that he was quick enough to catch up to good fastballs. Mark Schlereth of ESPN observed: \\"The bigger the game, the better he plays.\\" Minor leagues Davis was the 18th player taken in the first round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft, chosen by the New York Mets in his junior year as compensation for the Mets' loss of Tom Glavine to the Atlanta Braves in free agency. He was drafted for his power bat. Baseball America ranked him the third-best college power hitter in the draft, and The New York Times indicated that he projects to hit 25‚Äì30 home runs.\\"The Mets Choose Power With Top 2 Draft Picks\\", Ben Shpigel, The New York Times, June 6, 2008 He signed for $1.575 million. Davis said, \\"It was a huge thrill. I was excited to be picked by New York.\\" He received fatherly advice from his dad, and recalled: > He just said they've got the best fans, and it's a blast because every game > is live or die for them. It's a great environment to grow up playing > baseball, and learning how to play under pressure in front of all those > people. He loved it, and I'm looking forward to it, too. Davis was assigned to the Single-A Brooklyn Cyclones. On defense, he excelled, as he committed only one error in 492 total chances at first base, for a league-leading .998 fielding percentage. Uncharacteristically, he struggled on offense, batting only .256, without a home run in 58 games. Asked the following year to name his most embarrassing professional moment, he replied: \\"Not hitting one home run in my first professional season.\\" He noted: > It was first time I ever swung wood full time. I was learning how to play > pro ball. I had never played every day in my life. That's totally > different.... You have to learn to conserve your energy. In college, you > just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and > you'll wear out, because you play every single day. In 2009, Davis started the year with the St. Lucie Mets. He began to turn it around, hitting .289 with 7 home runs in 59 games. He was then promoted to the Double-A Binghamton Mets, where he came into his own, hitting .309 with 13 home runs, 41 RBIs, and a .565 slugging percentage in half a season. Mako Oliveras, the B-Mets manager, described him by saying: \\"Very live bat; the ball jumps off his bat when he makes contact. And as for defense, he's like a vacuum cleaner.\\" For 2009, Davis was named the Mets Organizational Player of the Year. After the season the Mets assigned him to the Surprise Rafters of the Arizona Fall League, where he hit .391. He was named to the Arizona Fall League's all star Rising Stars Game. In September 2009, he played for the gold-medal-winning U.S.A. World Cup team. In the off-season, Baseball America rated him the Mets‚Äô No. 4 prospect. Promoted to the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, to start the 2010 season, he hit .364 with a .500 on-base percentage in 10 games. For the week ending June 24, 2013, Davis was the Pacific Coast League's Player of the Week. In 2013, in 10 games with the AAA Las Vegas 51s, he batted .364 with a .500 on-base percentage and a .636 slugging percentage. In his minor league career, he batted .289, with a .376 OBP and a .487 slugging percentage in 752 at bats. Major leagues New York Mets 2010 Ike Davis at spring training Davis played in spring training with the Mets in 2010, and led the team with a .480 average as he hit 3 homers. He also sparkled on defense, prompting Jos√© Reyes to observe: \\"People talk about his hitting, but he is one of the best defensive first basemen you will ever see for a player his age.\\" Many Mets players were rooting for Davis to break camp with the team, but he was sent down to the minors at the end of spring training. On April 19, however, the Mets purchased Davis's minor league contract. At that point Davis had played only 65 games in his life above the Single-A level. Davis made his debut at Citi Field on April 19 against the Chicago Cubs. He singled in his first at bat, and had two singles in four at bats in a Mets win. \\"This is awesome,\\" he gushed. In a sign of acceptance and welcome, after the victory Mets veteran Jeff Francoeur slapped a shaving-cream pie in his face. Davis had two multi-hit games in his first four games. In his fifth game, on April 23, he hit his first home run. It traveled , onto Shea Bridge at Citi Field, and was the longest home run of any Met at Citi Field. He had his first multi-home-run game on May 7. A gifted, slick-fielding defensive first baseman, in 3 of his first 21 games he made spectacular catches of foul pop-ups, bracing himself against the railing in front of the first base dugout, and then flipping over the railing as he caught the ball. The Davis said: \\"I'm going to try to catch any ball I can. I've got long arms, I guess. I'd rather end the game, than worry about getting a bruise.\\" Eisenhower's 1952 presidential campaign; the banners were reprised in Davis's rookie season The Met fans began to treat him like a folk hero. The New York Post described him as a \\"cult hero.\\" Within a month of his debut, he had become a fan favorite. \\"I Like Ike\\" banners began appearing at Citi Field, a phrase once used in the decades-prior presidential campaigns of Dwight D. Eisenhower. Weeks later, he recalled: > I had such nerves the first few days. I didn't even have an approach. It was > just see the ball, hit the ball. Only now am I settling in, getting the > chance to think about how a pitcher is going to approach me. While the Mets had appeared uncertain whether Davis could handle the pressure of the major leagues as spring training ended, by mid-May‚Äîjust a month after calling him up to the majors‚Äîthey moved him to the cleanup spot in the batting order. Manager Jerry Manuel said: \\"I think we're going to try to leave him there for a while. I think he's ready to handle that.\\" On June 8, Davis hit his first career walk off home run, against the Padres' Edward Mujica. His 11 home runs prior to the All Star break tied with Benny Agbayani (1999) for the second-most by a Mets rookie, behind Ron Swoboda (15, in 1965). By September 26, as advanced defense metrics reflected a \\"UZR/150\\" (ultimate zone rating) of 12.5, putting him second in baseball behind Oakland's Daric Barton, sportswriter Mike Silva mused as to whether he could win a Gold Glove. Using the advanced metric Defensive Runs Saved, sportswriter John Dewan indicated that Davis was best in the NL and second-best in baseball, having saved 14 runs, again behind only Barton in the majors. He showed good range, and saved a number of throws with his soft hands on scoops. For the season, he was second among all NL rookies in runs (73), doubles (33), walks (72), extra-base hits (53), on-base percentage (.351), and OPS (.791). He was also third in RBIs (71) and slugging percentage (.440), and tied for third in home runs (19). He set the Mets rookie record for total bases (230). He also tied Lee Mazzilli's 1977 Mets rookie record in walks (72) and Ty Wigginton's 2003 Mets rookie record in extra-base hits (53).\\"Game Notes\\" , New York Mets, Friday, September 3, 2010, retrieved October 6, 2010 He was second among rookies in Mets history with 33 doubles (behind Wigginton), his 19 home runs tied for second-most with Ron Swoboda (1965), behind Darryl Strawberry (1983), his 71 RBIs tied for second with Wigginton, behind Strawberry, and his 138 hits were 4th on the Mets all-time list (behind Jay Payton‚Äî2000, Ron Hunt‚Äî1963, and Wigginton). Davis was named the first baseman on Baseball America's 2010 All- Rookie Team. He came in 7th in the voting for 2010 NL Rookie of the Year, receiving two third-place votes. 2011 Davis started the 2011 season by establishing a Mets record, with at least one RBI in 9 of his first 10 games. On May 10, he sustained a left ankle sprain and bone bruise, initially misdiagnosed by the Mets as a strained calf, in a collision with third baseman David Wright.Once a major league slugger, Ike Davis is revamping his career as a pitcher in the minor leagues - LA Times The injury occurred on a routine popup near the pitcher's mound, with Davis rolling his ankle in an injury that didn't appear very serious at the time. On June 22, he was told that the injury might require season-ending surgery. On September 6, ESPN reported that Davis was rehabbing his ankle and would not need surgery. During his injury- shortened 2011 season, Davis batted .302 with a .925 OPS, in 139 at bats in 36 games. He hit 7 home runs, and had 25 RBIs. In 2011, Davis also appeared on an episode of the fourth season of MTV's game show Silent Library. 2012 In early March 2012, Davis was diagnosed with valley fever, a rare dust-borne fungal infection endemic in the American southwest.2012 spring training - Ike Davis of New York Mets says he doesn't have valley fever symptoms The effects of it lingered with him for years. New York Mets in 2012 Davis started the season slowly, but then began hitting, getting one homer in each of three games of a four-game span in mid-April. On May 24, he had the second-lowest batting average (.159) of all qualified major leaguers. As of June 15, he had raised his batting average to .188. On June 18, Davis hit his first career grand slam against Jake Arrieta of the Orioles. The grand slam also extended his hitting streak to 9 games, and Davis hit .462 (12-for-26) during the span. After the hot streak Davis cooled and again struggled. Davis was ejected from a Major League game for the first time in his career on June 26, when he argued with umpire Manny Gonzalez after Steve Clevenger was ruled safe at first on a pickoff attempt. In June, he had 10 consecutive extra-base hits (five home runs and five doubles), the second-longest such streak in Mets history. On July 28, Davis hit home runs in his first three at bats (all solo home runs) against the Arizona Diamondbacks' Ian Kennedy, eventually going 4-for-4 (adding a single in his final at bat). Davis became only the 9th Met in history to hit 3 home runs in one game. The 3 homers in one game were also a career high for Davis; with them he also reached 20 home runs for the season, breaking his prior year high of 19 home runs. He ended the 2012 season with a .227 batting average, 32 home runs (5th in the National League), and 90 RBIs, as his home-run-every-16.2-at-bats was 3rd in the NL behind Giancarlo Stanton and Ryan Braun. He became the 16th Met to surpass 30 home runs in a season. On defense, his fielding percentage of .994 at first base was 5th-best in the league. 2013 Davis struggled early in 2013 and became a subject of criticism for many Mets fans and sports analysts. In June, Davis was sent down to Triple-A Las Vegas for 10 games, in which he batted .364. He was recalled in early July. He tied a team record set by John Olerud in 1998, by reaching base at least twice in 12 straight starts from July 29 ‚Äì August 13. He recovered to hit .286 in the second half, with a .449 on-base percentage. For the season, he batted .205 with 9 home runs and 33 RBIs for the Mets, in 103 games. 2014 Davis was the 2014 Opening Day starting first baseman for the Mets. Early in the season he was platooned with Lucas Duda and Josh Satin. On April 4, Mets' manager Terry Collins announced that Duda would get the bulk of the playing time at first base. On April 5, Davis hit a walk-off grand slam coming off the bench against the Cincinnati Reds. Pittsburgh Pirates Pittsburgh Pirates in 2014 On April 18, 2014, the Mets traded Davis to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Zack Thornton and a player to be named later, Blake Taylor. Davis hit another grand slam against the Reds on April 21, becoming the third player in MLB history to switch teams midseason and hit a grand slam against the same opponent (following Ray Boone in 1953, and Mike Piazza in 1998), and the first player to hit grand slams for different teams in the same April. Overall, in Pittsburgh he hit .235 with 10 home runs and 46 RBIs in 336 at-bats, splitting time with Gaby Sanchez at first. For the season, on defense he had the best Range Factor/9 Innings of all major league first basemen, at 10.59. With the bases loaded, he tied for second in the National League in grand slams (2), and tied for fourth in RBIs (17). As a pinch hitter, he tied for second in the NL in home runs (3) and RBIs (12). Davis was designated for assignment by the Pirates on November 20, 2014. Oakland Athletics On November 23, 2014, the Pirates traded Davis to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for bonus slots for use in signing international free agents. On April 21, 2015, Davis pitched a perfect eighth inning in the losing side of a blowout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, retiring all 3 batters he faced, all on ground balls, using only 9 pitches. Davis in high school was 23‚Äì0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It was the first time the A‚Äôs had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino in 2000. On August 21, 2015 it was announced Davis would undergo surgery to repair a torn hip labrum, ending his season. Texas Rangers On February 15, 2016, Davis signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers. Hampered by injuries throughout spring training, Davis was assigned to the Triple-A Round Rock Express to begin the season. On June 12, Davis was released from his contract in order to pursue a major league opportunity elsewhere. In 39 games with the Express, Davis hit .268/.350/.437 with 4 HR, 25 RBI, and 37 strikeouts. New York Yankees On June 12, 2016, Davis agreed to a major league contract with the New York Yankees. The Yankees depth at first base was very thin, with four first baseman on the disabled list, and middle infielder Rob Refsnyder manning the position at the major league level at the time of his signing. He was designated for assignment by the Yankees on June 25. Two days later, he was outrighted from the 40-man roster to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Triple-A International League. On August 10, Davis was released by the organization. Los Angeles Dodgers Davis signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on January 27, 2017. He began the 2017 season playing first base for the Oklahoma City Dodgers of the AAA Pacific Coast League.\\"OKC Dodgers journal: Cody Bellinger remains hot at plate\\"News OK In 35 games, he hit .212/.258/.412 for Oklahoma City.Ike Davis Stats, Highlights, Bio MiLB.com After the season, Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports ranked him the 13th-best free agent first baseman.\\"MLB's top 2017 free-agent first basemen\\" In midseason, Davis switched to pitching and made his debut on the mound for the Arizona League Dodgers, pitching one scoreless inning, striking out the side as his fastball was in the 88-92 mph range.

Malone (1900‚Äì1981) chaired the California Democratic Party during and after World War II. He was the most powerful Democratic Party leader of San Francisco (and, arguably, of California) during the later Roosevelt and Truman Administrations. An attorney with only a small personal injury law practice he shared with Raymond L. Sullivan, Malone was akin to a political \\"boss\\" whose influence extended throughout the state. He controlled most of the federal patronage appointments in the state until his friend President Harry Truman left office in 1953. The son of Irish immigrants,Beyond a brief entry in http://www.politicalgraveyard.com, there seems to be no other comprehensive biographic source on Malone. A few details of Malone's earlier life were found in 1930 Census data at http://www.ancestry.com Malone began his political career by allegiance to political \\"boss\\" Thomas Finn. A veteran California politician who was Under-Sheriff and then Sheriff of San Francisco from the time of the 1906 earthquake through the later years of Prohibition, Finn was the Republican political boss who had supplanted the Buckley and Ruef machines that dominated San Francisco municipal government after the turn of the century. Still in power in 1930, Finn was also the early political mentor of Arthur Samish, later the notorious liquor lobbyist whose enormous influence in the California Legislature of the 1940s led to a national political scandal.\\"Blind Chris\\" Buckley, the Democratic boss of San Francisco, dominated the city government in the interests of the Southern Pacific Railroad until he had to flee the country to escape prosecution. He was replaced by \\"Boss\\" Abe Ruef whose crony, Mayor Eugene Schmitz was in office at the time of the 1906 earthquake, when both were convicted on charges of corruption.(See Walton Bean, Boss Ruef's San Francisco: The Story of the Union Labor Party, Big Business, and the Graft Prosecution, University of California Press, 1968) Samish recalled his early connection with Finn in his autobiography, written with Bob Thomas, The Secret Boss of California; the Life and high times of Art Samish (NY, 1971) Malone's rise to power as the Democratic counterpoint to Finn is still undocumented, but by 1940, he had consolidated his hold on the San Francisco Democratic Party organization, in partnership with labor leader John F. Shelley (later Congressman and Mayor of San Francisco), and was recognized by the Democratic National Committee in New Deal Washington as arbiter of the \\"Federal Brigade\\", those California Democratic stalwarts appointed to political patronage positions in a vast number of federal agencies.Cyr Copertini, \\"Campaign Housekeeping, 1940-1965\\", Transcript of Oral History interviews, Regional Oral History Office, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 1987 Copertini came into San Francisco politics as Malone's young secretary in 1940 and remained for forty years, eventually serving as confidential aide to Mayors George Moscone and Dianne Feinstein] Though colleagues believed his personal philosophy to be considerably more conservative than that of most liberal New Dealers, Malone rarely spoke about \\"issues\\". His interest was in dispensing patronage and winning elections to gain and maintain power and his campaign expertise was highly regarded by such liberal candidates as Helen Gahagan Douglas, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 1950 who was defeated with \\"red-baiting\\" tactics by Richard Nixon. Malone's influence was already on the wane by 1952, when a new generation of liberals, inspired by the presidential candidacy of Adlai Stevenson, became active in Democratic politics. His reputation had been tarnished the year before by Senator Estes Kefauver's investigation into organized crime through much-publicized public hearings. Hardly on a par with the Mafia kingpins whom Kefauver's committee subpoenaed elsewhere in the country, a half dozen Malone associates (including James G. Smyth, the former State Assembly clerk and Democratic campaign manager whom Truman appointed, and then fired, as Collector of Internal Revenue for northern California) were called to account for alleged misdeeds. Malone's brother was implicated in the subsequent scandal, and Malone himself, embittered, soon resigned his formal Party position.A Rage for Justice, John Jacobs, 1997, p. 21. Having been a delegate to almost every Democratic National Convention since 1940, Malone attended his last in 1960, the Los Angeles Convention that nominated John F. Kennedy. Malone was himself very enthusiastic about Kennedy's candidacy, though he reluctantly recognized that a Democratic changing of the guard was in progress. In his own San Francisco, this turnover was led by the coterie that surrounded stridently liberal Assemblyman Phillip Burton, Malone's long-time enemy, who succeeded Malone's friend John Shelley as the city's Democratic Congressman when Shelley became Mayor in 1964.The Burton family's insurgency to replace Malone is recorded by John Jacobs, A Rage for Justice: The Passion and Politics of Phillip Burton (University of California Press, 1995) Malone's influence was still felt in 1968, when he backed Joseph Alioto's winning bid to succeed the sickly Shelley as Mayor, a blow to the so-called \\"Burton Machine\\" which had been grooming a candidate of its own. Later that year, Alioto delivered the nominating speech at the Democratic National Convention for presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey, who was also strongly supported by Malone at a time of deep division among Democrats over the Vietnam War that led to Humphrey's defeat by Richard Nixon. But by the time of Malone's death in 1981, his name was all but forgotten within the California Democratic Party he had dominated for so many years. Today, ironically, the state Party is chaired by veteran legislator John Burton, Phillip's brother, who is thus the latest successor to William Malone.

The two-story brick and concrete structure was built in 1926 to house the Turner-Todd Motor Company. See also: It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 2008. History The main two-story portion of the building was constructed in 1926. A l-l/2 -story addition was added to the east end of the building in 1940, as is announced by its own cornerstone. The Turner-Todd Motor Company, which had changed its name to the Turner Motor Company in 1932, closed its doors in 1943, but, though now obsolete as a showroom, the building still remained involved in the automobile industry by housing various auto parts stores from 1944 to 2002, the last of which was CarQuest Auto Parts. The building is now primarily occupied by property developer Rogers & Willard, Inc., as well as software development firm Rural Sourcing, Inc.https://www.ruralsourcing.com/development-services-mobile-al/ who has occupied the building since November 2015.https://www.al.com/news/mobile/2015/03/first_look_5m_renovation_of_mo.html Building Description As an early example of a purpose built auto dealership, the Turner-Todd Motor Company building is a significant local example of a prevailing architectural style adapted to the purpose of the automobile industry. The interior of the main portion of the building originally had an open arrangement for the display of automobiles. The showroom was located near the entrance on the west end, while offices were located to the rear. This was altered with the closing of the dealership in 1943. The building was subsequently used by an auto parts dealer and a large service counter was added. The interior walls near the east end of the main building, which was used as a service center, are bare structural tile. A distinguishing feature of the first floor is the concrete ramp located at the rear. Entering from the rolled metal door on the south end of the west elevation, cars were driven up the ramp and stored on the second floor.

The ceiling features exposed wood framing supporting the roof. Black & White photo of Turner Todd Motor Company building in 2008 Restoration (2014-2015) In 2014, Mobile, AL property developer Rogers & Willard, Inc., the current owner of the Turner-Todd Motor Company building, announced that the building would be renovated into modern office spaces and possibly a restaurant space. In September 2015 Rogers & Willard moved into the first refurbished space. The main portion of the first floor has gone through extensive renovations with workspace for around 140 employees in preparation for occupancy by Atlanta- based Rural Sourcing Inc. (RSI), who has occupied the first floor since November 2015. Among the renovations were the refinishing of all window frames and replacement of all of the original window glass, brick facade repairs, installation of modern plumbing and utility equipment, installation of a larger stairwell and elevator, repaving of sidewalks and the parking lot in the rear of the building, installation of modern HVAC equipment, and the build-out of the internal spaces to provide a modern workspace. Care was taken to honor the history of the building and comply with the guidelines for historic building renovation. As a nostalgic touch, the original Buick logos on the cornices of the building were restored to their original appearance of white letters with blue relief.

Plot Synopsis  The poem can be split in two parts, Sections 1-8 and Sections 9-15. During the first part, Whitman describes the open road ‚Äúas a metaphorical journey characterized by freedom, independence and affirmations of self, time and place‚Äù (Kreidler). During this part, Whitman notices how everything is as it should be. He realizes that along the journey one will face a test of wisdom, but, as stated by Kreidler, ‚ÄúWhitman says, ‚Äònot [the wisdom] finally tested in schools‚Äô (92); rather, the wisdom of the soul, revealed through provoking questions, experiences in nature, and experiences along the journey. Further, he avers happiness is the ‚Äòefflux of the soul,‚Äô flowing out, and ‚Äòfalls distilled the charm that mocks beauty and attainment‚Äô‚Äù (143). During part two, Whitman welcomes company along his journey by repeating ‚Äúthe word ‚ÄòAllons‚Äô meaning ‚ÄòWe go‚Äô or ‚ÄòLet's go,‚Äô‚Äù (Kreidler).  Key Concepts  The historical context found in ‚ÄúSong of The Open Road‚Äù is describing the westward expansion of the United States, ‚Äú an era characterized by the call of adventure and opportunity for those courageous enough make the journey west, i.e. to follow the open road,‚Äù (Kreidler). Kreidler discussed how Whitman was greatly influenced by politics and political movements. Using the westward expansion as inspiration in this piece allowed for Whitman‚Äôs audience to better understand and relate to this poem. Whitman also incorporates some religious contexts, like referencing Swedenborgianism. Kreidler explains that, ‚ÄúSwedenborgianism espoused a belief that a spiritual component existed within every living and material being. Swedenborg also believed that every part of the body held a particular communication with the Divine.‚Äù In Whitman‚Äôs poem the readers can see this belief when he starts to introduce the ‚ÄúSong‚Äù in Section 7, ‚ÄúHere is the efflux of the soul; / The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd gates, ever provoking questions.‚Äù  Symbolism  In Whitman‚Äôs poem, the reader can find symbolism through the journey of life and the open, democratic society of that time. In the first 8 sections of the poem, Whitman observes the freedoms in life shown through the open road, ‚ÄúAfoot and light- hearted I take to the open road; Healthy, free, the world before me; The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.‚Äù Whitman wants his readers to feel free while reading this, and he wants them to know that he wrote this poem to ensure the feeling of freedom upon them.  The Ending Whitman ends his poem ‚Äúwith the persona awaiting an affirmative response from his reader‚Äù (Kummings). The narrator in his poem reaches his hand out to the reader and asks them to join him on the journey. Whitman added this as his poem ending to make the reader question, ‚Äúwill they join him on this journey through the open road?‚Äù(Kummings). It is almost as if the narrator doesn‚Äôt want to complete the journey of life on his own; he wants the company. This is not a common approach in poem endings, but Whitman also wants to make his readers question, ‚Äúdo you want to complete the journey alone, or do you want to accompany someone for the rest of your life's journey?‚Äù By leaving his readers questioning their life choices, Whitman is able to help them figure out their life in a way.

It was designed by Henry Kitchen and built from 1845 by Reverend Thomas Sharpe. It is also known as All Saints Rectory, Entelly and Wyoming Lodge. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002. The house is now named after Miss Ida Traill (1889-1976), who lived in the house from 1931 until 1976. Ida Traill was a descendant of early settlers in the region. Her great grandfathers were selected by Governor Macquarie to explore and settle the area. Ida Traill bequeathed the home to the National Trust of Australia. It is now a house museum containing a significant collection relating to Ida Traill's family, including her furniture, horse- racing memorabilia, and artifacts linked to the early history of Bathurst.  History  Aboriginal people and colonisation Aboriginal occupation of the Blue Mountains area dates back at least 12,000 years and appears to have intensified some 3000‚Äì4000 years ago. In pre-colonial times the area now known as Bathurst was inhabited by Aboriginal people of the Wiradjuri linguistic group. The clan associated with Bathurst occupied on a seasonal basis most of the Macquarie River area. They moved regularly in small groups but preferred the open land and used the waterways for a variety of food. There are numerous river flats where debris from recurrent camps accumulated over a long period. European settlement in this region after the first documented white expedition west of the Blue Mountains in 1813 was tentative because of apprehensions about resistance from Aboriginal people. There was some contact, witnessed by sporadic hostility and by the quantity of surviving artefacts manufactured by the Aborigines from European glass. By 1840 there was widespread dislocation of Aboriginal culture, aggravated after 1850 by the goldrush to the region. Prior to European settlement in Australia, the Wiradjuri Aboriginal group lived in the upper Macquarie Valley. Bathurst was proclaimed a town by Lachlan Macquarie on 7 May 1815, named after Lord Bathurst, Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies. Bathurst is Australia's oldest inland township. Bathurst Governor Macquarie chose the site of the future town of Bathurst on 7 May 1815 during his tour over the Blue Mountains, on the road already completed by convict labour supervised by William Cox. Macquarie marked out the boundaries near the depot established by surveyor George Evans and reserved a site for a government house and domain. Reluctant to open the rich Bathurst Plains to a large settlement, Macquarie authorised few grants there initially, one of the first being 1000 acres to William Lawson, one of the three European explorers who crossed the mountains in 1813. The road-maker William Cox was another early grantee but later had to move his establishment to Kelso on the non-government side of the Macquarie River. A modest release of land in February 1818 occurred when ten men were chosen to take up 50 acre farms and 2 acre town allotments across the river from the government buildings. When corruption by government supervisor Richard Lewis and acting Commandant William Cox caused their dismissal, they were replaced by Lieutenant William Lawson who became Commandant of the settlement in 1818. Macquarie continued to restrict Bathurst settlement and reserved all land on the south side of the Macquarie River for government buildings and stock, a situation that prevailed until 1826. In December 1819 Bathurst had a population of only 120 people in 30 houses, two thirds being in the township of Kelso on the eastern side of the river and the remainder scattered on rural landholdings nearby. The official report in 1820 numbered Bathurst settlers at 114, including only 14 women and 15 children. The government buildings consisted of a brick house for the commandant, brick barracks for the military detachment and houses for the stock keeper, and log houses for the 50 convicts who worked the government farm. Never successful, the government farm was closed by Governor Darling in 1828. Governor Darling, arriving in Sydney in 1825, promptly commenced a review of colonial administration and subsequently introduced vigorous reforms. On advice from Viscount Goderich, Darling divided colonial expenditure into two parts: one to cover civil administration, funded by New South Wales; the other for the convict system, funded by Britain. By this time, J. McBrien and Robert Hoddle had surveyed the existing grants in the vicinity. Surveyor James Bym Richards began work on the south side of the river in 1826. But the town was apparently designed by Thomas Mitchell in 1830 and did not open until late 1833 after Richards had completed the layout of the streets with their two-road allotments. The first sales were held in 1831 before the survey was complete. In 1832 the new Governor, Major General Sir Richard Bourke, visited Bathurst in October. He instructed the Surveyor General Major Thomas L. Mitchell to make arrangements for \\"opening the town of Bathurst without delay\\" and he in turn instructed the Assistant Surveyor at Bathurst J. B. Richards to lay out the blocks and streets. This was done in September 1833. It is believed that Major Mitchell named the streets, with George Street being named after King George III. Miss Traill's House On 29 January 1845 the Reverend Thomas Sharpe, the first Rector of All Saints' Cathedral, Bathurst, was granted allotments 1 and 2 in Russell Street Bathurst on which he built his rectory. The construction on Reverend Thomas Sharpe's Colonial Georgian styled house is believed to have begun around this time.Stephenson and McKerrow, 1999 According to photographs and paintings of the house and garden since 1846, the garden was carefully planned and planted soon after the houe was built, and was carefully tended over the decades.Atkinson & Harvey, 2014 After the death of Reverend Thomas and Mrs Sharpe in 1877 their eldest son John inherited the property. John lived there for two periods totaling fourteen years. John let the property to a series of tenants for a period of thirteen years. One of the tenants, Mrs Mary Newton operated the Wyoming Lodge, a school for girls, between 1869 and 1902. In 1904 the property was sold to William Alfred McLean, a local builder who undertook extensive renovations to the property. McLean's refurbishment gave the house a federation look. In 1923 William McLean sold the property to Robert Lionel Gilmour, a local glazier. The Gilmours made minor changes to the property. In 1932 Mrs Gertrude Traill and her daughter Ida rented the house, purchasing it in 1937. Soon after the purchase they modernized the kitchen and bathroom. Later changes were stylistic in character and aimed at giving the house a more colonial look. Ida Traill was a fourth generation descendant of William Lee and Thomas Kite, both of whom settled in Bathurst in 1818. Lee and Kite were the most successful of Governor Macquarie's ten 1818 settlers. As a result of childhood contact with her grandfather George Lee and his wife Emily (n√©e Kite) who lived at Leeholme, a large homestead close to Bathurst, she became interested in family history. Through inheritance and purchase she acquired a significant collection of artifacts relating to four generations of the Lee family in Bathurst. These items, together with her own furniture, furnishings, paintings and ceramics, were left to the National Trust in 1976 along with the house and grounds. Miss Traill took a great interest in her garden and built a conservatory in the 1960s to shelter favourite plants from winter cold. Following its acquisition by the National Trust, the garden was described by Sheila Higgins who worked on its early conservation as \\"a very special and almost unchanged rare garden of the period\\", and it remains so today. The Trust has been scrupulous in retaining established plantings: two pear trees are documented as being planted in 1852, and it is estimated that the heritage rose \\"Souvenir de Mme.

A large area is devoted to woodland, planted with a variety of bulbs, swathes of winter roses or hellebores, dark red tree paeonies, may bush or Spiraea, yellow jasmine and lilac: a mass planting of the succulent Echeveria elegans growing in the shade, a traditional herb garden guarded by an arch of star jasmine, a number of hawthorns and a pink Floridan dogwood tree.Atkinson & Harvey, 2014, 18 A large part of the property's magic comes from the collection within, much of it linked directly to horses legendary in Australia's equine history. The horses were bred by Miss Traill's grandfather, George Lee, at Leeholme near Bathurst and much of the memorabilia associated with their fairytale successes was inherited by or given to Ida Traill, who displayed it proudly in her own home. In the hall, studio portraits of George Lee and his wife Emily hang next to a framed photograph of 1899 Melbourne Cup winner Merriwee. Above hangs a watercolour depicting the pedigree of Merriwee and other famous horses bred by Lee, such as Etra-Weenie, Nellie and Sappho. Oil portraits of The Barb, inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame in 2004, and his sister Gulnare, painted by (colonial artist) Joseph Fowles (1810‚Äì78), are highly significant in the collection, and once a year, the 18 carat Sydney Cup (1870) won by Barbelle at Randwick Racecourse is displayed under guard at the property. Of all these, The Barb, known as the \\"Black Demon\\" reached equestrian stratospheric heights. Twice winner of the Sydney Cup (1868 and 1869), winner of the Melbourne Cup in 1866, The Metropolitan (1868) and the Port Phillip Stakes (1869), The Barb proved time and again that he was the best horse in Australia in his day. As a five year old, he was undefeated in seven strats. In all, he won 15 of his 23 starts. The Barb was bred by Lee (1834-1912), pastoralist and stud-breeder. Lee inherited land at Kelso and other stations including South Condobolin, later known as Merriwee, when his father died in 1870 and built Leeholme at Kelso in 1872. With descendants of his father's grey mare, Sappho, Lee bred race horses, most of which he leased or sold. The Black Demon's memory lives on at Miss Traill's House, among memorabilia and artefacts relating to four generations of the Lee family in Bathurst, bequeathed to the National Trust of Australia (NSW) along with the house and grounds, by Miss Ida Trailll in 1976Atkinson, 2013, 9(Le Seuer (2015, 6) notes the bequeath date as 1978). With funding from local and state governments and the Central West Women's Committee (of the National Trust of Australia (NSW)), volunteers carried out considerable maintenance works to structural cracks, re-wallpapered Miss Traill's mother's room (with a wallpaper copied from the original), exterior repainting.

(National Trust of Australia (NSW), 1999)  Description  Garden The property sits on a corner block and by current standards appears to be a double block, the house in the half closer to the street corner, and a large garden and service yard area wrapping around it to the north and east. The garden is designed with a clear hierarchy with the superior rooms at the front of the house facing the garden while the rooms at the back of the house with a lower standard of detail face the service courtyard. Features of the country styled garden include a courtyard, wishing well, sundial, stone benches, pergola, greenhouse, a drying yard with clothes prop, shed and garage. Following its acquisition by the National Trust, the garden was described as \\"a very special and almost unchanged rare garden of the period\\", and it remains so. The Trust has been scrupulous in retaining established plantings: two pear trees (Pyrus communis cv.) are documented as being planted in 1852 (one is near the house's north-western corner).Atkinson & Harvey, 2014, 17-18 The property is also notable for its paddock, a rare survivor of a feature common to many similar properties in the days when horses, milking cows and other livestock were part of the household. A large area is devoted to woodland, planted with a variety of bulbs, swathes of winter roses or hellebores, dark red tree paeonies, may bush or Spiraea, yellow jasmine and lilac: a mass planting of the succulent Echeveria elegans growing in the shade, a traditional herb garden guarded by an arch of star jasmine, a number of hawthorns and a pink Floridan dogwood tree. The garden has a number of typical 19th century plants and early 20th century garden plantings, including a collection of roses and climbing roses, such as \\"Tea Rambler\\" a pink form.Read, S., pers.comm., 8/2006 Roses It is estimated that the heritage rose \\"Souvenir de Mme. Leonie Viennot\\" which blooms today in the courtyard is over 100 years old. The garden's collection of roses includes \\"Crimson Glory\\", \\"Frau Karl Druschki\\", \\"Mermaid\\", \\"Stanwell Perpetual\\", \\"Carabella\\" and 'Perle d'Or' which was grown from a cutting at Leeholm, the property of Miss Traill's grandparents. Roses include the following cultivars/hybrids/species: Cecile Brunner; Pinkie; R.laevigata (the Cherokee rose); Dorothy Perkins; Tea Rambler;Claret Cup; R.rugosa \\"Alba\\", R.banksiae \\"Aurea\\" (Lady Banks' rose) plus a number of modern Tea (Hybrid tea) roses, e.g.: Iceberg, Pacali etc. House A late Colonial Georgian house built of a combination of bricklaying styles. The c. 1845 main house and the c. 1855 Rev. Sharpe's study consisted of English bond (now painted), the kitchen and laundry brickwork is a variation of Flemish bond, while the c. 1905 repairs are a pseudo Flemish bond. Corrugated iron dated c. 1905 covers the original timber shingled roof. The turned verandah columns are original although the brackets to the verandah posts are an 1872 embellishment. The verandah floor is of modern brick. The main house, study and kitchen have very deep chimney stacks. French doors lead to the garden and the house contains four paneled internal doors. The contents of the house include English and Australian furniture dating from c. 1810, family memorabilia such as photographs, china, racing times, trophies, early Australian items, enameled pottery, ceramics, metalwares (trays, vases, candle sticks), glassware, rugs, books, and notable landscape and portrait paintings. The property's extensive art collection includes a portrait of Emily Kite by Joseph Backler (1847), two equestrian oils by Joseph Fowles (1810-1878), \\"Harbour study with barquentine\\" attributed to the surveyor George Evans (1780-1852), and one of shipping in an Australian harbour by F.L Montague (1869). A second group of fine oil paintings appear to be in the same period as the first group but by European painters. These include two early nineteenth century portraits of children apparently by Tinier, a painting of a \\"coach hunting party\\" by W. Williams, and a European landscape by Charles Leslie (1879). The third group of lesser paintings consists of watercolours, Impressionist paintings by Edward Combes (1830‚Äì95), post-Impressionist sketches and a large abstract painting by John Power (1881-1943). Other significant artefacts include; The Sydney Cup won by Barbelle in 1870, Silver cups presented in the 1870s to George Lee for show success with Durham cattle, and an invitation to Mr and Mrs Lee to the 1901 opening of the first Australian Commonwealth Parliament The physical condition of the house was reported as good as at 3 July 2000. The integrity of the house has been maintained by preserving the furnishings and property of Miss Traill's. The house and property are being maintained and have been unaltered from the way in which Miss Traill left it.  Heritage listing  Built in 1845, Miss Traill's House with its garden and paddock is part of the early history of Bathurst. Its main significance however, was as the home of Miss Ida Traill who lived there from 1932 to 1976. A descendant of two of the region's main pastoralist families, Miss Traill was strongly influenced by her grandfather, George Lee, who bred horses legendary in Australia's equine history. Single, strong-willed but careful, Miss Traill inherited, amassed and cared for a collection which is a valuable insight into the influence and aspirations of the family. The collection is an intrinsic part of her home, where it is presented today; a family treasure unique to the nation.Wesley, R., in McDonald & Molloy, 2006 Miss Traill's House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Miss Traill's House has historical significant as it reflects not only the history of the Kites and Lee families but also has great potential to represent the early history of Bathurst and its district viewed through the lens of the lifestyle, interests and possessions of Miss Ida Traill. Through the association with a range of people including Reverend Thomas Sharpe, William McLean, Mary Newton, Robert Gilmour and the Lee, Kite and Traill families the house, grounds and collections provide evidence of the ways of life in the Bathurst districts. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The cottage is aesthetically significant using design techniques such as a pyramid shaped roof and the use of the so-called Hambeldon plan, a sophisticated cottage design with a garden and entrance front, introduced into NSW by the architect Henry Kitchen. The house, grounds and collection show unusually accurate evidence of Miss Traill's lifestyle. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Miss Traill's house is technically significant as it is contributing to the historical, social and environmental construction of Bathurst in the mid-eighteenth to nineteenth centuries. The unique architectural design of the house in conjunction with the extensive collection of artifacts relating to the history of one influential family provides a strong foundation in representing the construction of the Bathurst districts. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The collection of rare artworks, trophies, photographs and memorabilia represents the historical, cultural and social construction of the times. Notable artworks include a portrait of Emily Kite by Backler, 1847, and two equestrian oils by Joseph Fowles. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Miss Traill's House displays an accurate representation of class and era through a complete collection of furnishings and memorabilia associated with Kite and Lee families. It is the only substantial house of its period remaining in Bathurst structurally unaltered in any major respect. The garden preserves a typical pattern of geometrically designed flowerbeds.

A line segment AB from point A to point B has the opposite direction to line segment BA. Two directed line segments are equipollent when they have the same length and direction. History Overview The concept of equipollent line segments was advanced by Giusto Bellavitis in 1835. Subsequently the term vector was adopted for a class of equipollent line segments. Bellavitis's use of the idea of a relation to compare different but similar objects has become a common mathematical technique, particularly in the use of equivalence relations. Bellavitis used a special notation for the equipollence of segments AB and CD: :AB \\\\bumpeq CD . The following passages, translated by Michael J. Crowe, show the anticipation that Bellavitis had of vector concepts: :Equipollences continue to hold when one substitutes for the lines in them, other lines which are respectively equipollent to them, however they may be situated in space. From this it can be understood how any number and any kind of lines may be summed, and that in whatever order these lines are taken, the same equipollent-sum will be obtained... :In equipollences, just as in equations, a line may be transferred from one side to the other, provided that the sign is changed... Thus oppositely directed segments are negatives of each other: AB + BA \\\\bumpeq 0 . :The equipollence AB \\\\bumpeq n.CD , where n stands for a positive number, indicates that AB is both parallel to and has the same direction as CD, and that their lengths have the relation expressed by AB = n.CD.Michael J. Crowe (1967) A History of Vector Analysis, \\"Giusto Bellavitis and His Calculus of Equipollences\\", pp 52‚Äì4, University of Notre Dame Press The segment from A to B is a bound vector, while the class of segments equipollent to it is a free vector, in the parlance of Euclidean vectors. Examples Among the historical applications of equipollences by Bellavitis and others, the conjugate diameters of ellipses as well as hyperbolas shall be discussed: a) Conjugate diameter of ellipses Bellavitis (1854)Bellavitis (1854), ¬ß¬ß 145ff defined the equipollence OM of an ellipse and the respective tangent MT as :(1a) \\\\begin{matrix} & \\\\mathrm{OM}\\\\bumpeq x\\\\mathrm{OA}+y\\\\mathrm{OB}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathrm{MT}\\\\bumpeq-y\\\\mathrm{OA}+x\\\\mathrm{OB}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\left[x^{2}+y^{2}=1;\\\\ x=\\\\cos t,\\\\ y=\\\\sin t\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow & \\\\mathrm{OM}\\\\bumpeq\\\\cos t\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{OA}+\\\\sin t\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{OB} \\\\end{matrix} where OA and OB are conjugate semi-diameters of the ellipse, both of which he related to two other conjugated semi-diameters OC and OD by the following relation and its inverse: :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathrm{OC} & \\\\bumpeq c\\\\mathrm{OA}+d\\\\mathrm{OB} & \\\\qquad & & \\\\mathrm{OA} & \\\\bumpeq c\\\\mathrm{OC}-d\\\\mathrm{OD}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{OD} & \\\\bumpeq-d\\\\mathrm{OA}+c\\\\mathrm{OB} & & & \\\\mathrm{OB} & \\\\bumpeq d\\\\mathrm{OC}+c\\\\mathrm{OD} \\\\end{align} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[c^{2}+d^{2}=1\\\\right] \\\\end{matrix} producing the invariant :(\\\\mathrm{OC})^{2}+(\\\\mathrm{OD})^{2}\\\\bumpeq(\\\\mathrm{OA})^{2}+(\\\\mathrm{OB})^{2}. Substituting the inverse into (1a), he showed that OM retains its form :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\mathrm{OM}\\\\bumpeq(cx+dy)\\\\mathrm{OC}+(cy-dx)\\\\mathrm{OD}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[(cx+dy)^{2}+(cy-dx)^{2}=1\\\\right] \\\\end{matrix} b) Conjugate diameter of hyperbolas In the French translation of Bellavitis' 1854-paper, Charles-Ange Laisant (1874) added a chapter in which he adapted the above analysis to the hyperbola. The equipollence OM and its tangent MT of a hyperbola is defined byLaisant (1874), pp. 133ff :(1b) \\\\begin{matrix} & \\\\mathrm{OM}\\\\bumpeq x\\\\mathrm{OA}+y\\\\mathrm{OB}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathrm{MT}\\\\bumpeq y\\\\mathrm{OA}+x\\\\mathrm{OB}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\left[x^{2}-y^{2}=1;\\\\ x=\\\\cosh t,\\\\ y=\\\\sinh t\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow & \\\\mathrm{OM}\\\\bumpeq\\\\cosh t\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{OA}+\\\\sinh t\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{OB} \\\\end{matrix} Here, OA and OB are conjugate semi-diameters of a hyperbola with OB being imaginary, both of which he related to two other conjugated semi-diameters OC and OD by the following transformation and its inverse: :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\begin{aligned}\\\\mathrm{OC} & \\\\bumpeq c\\\\mathrm{OA}+d\\\\mathrm{OB} & \\\\qquad & & \\\\mathrm{OA} & \\\\bumpeq c\\\\mathrm{OC}-d\\\\mathrm{OD}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{OD} & \\\\bumpeq d\\\\mathrm{OA}+c\\\\mathrm{OB} & & & \\\\mathrm{OB} & \\\\bumpeq-d\\\\mathrm{OC}+c\\\\mathrm{OD} \\\\end{aligned} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[c^{2}-d^{2}=1\\\\right] \\\\end{matrix} producing the invariant relation :(\\\\mathrm{OC})^{2}-(\\\\mathrm{OD})^{2}\\\\bumpeq(\\\\mathrm{OA})^{2}-(\\\\mathrm{OB})^{2}. Substituting into (1b), he showed that OM retains its form :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\mathrm{OM}\\\\bumpeq(cx-dy)\\\\mathrm{OC}+(cy-dx)\\\\mathrm{OD}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[(cx-dy)^{2}-(cy-dx)^{2}=1\\\\right] \\\\end{matrix} From a modern perspective, Laisant's transformation between two pairs of conjugate semi-diameters can be interpreted as Lorentz boosts in terms of hyperbolic rotations, as well as their visual demonstration in terms of Minkowski diagrams (see History of Lorentz transformations#Laisant). Extension Geometric equipollence is also used on the sphere: :To appreciate Hamilton's method, let us first recall the much simpler case of the Abelian group of translations in Euclidean three- dimensional space. Each translation is representable as a vector in space, only the direction and magnitude being significant, and the location irrelevant. The composition of two translations is given by the head-to-tail parallelogram rule of vector addition; and taking the inverse amounts to reversing direction. In Hamilton's theory of turns, we have a generalization of such a picture from the Abelian translation group to the non-Abelian SU(2). Instead of vectors in space, we deal with directed great circle arcs, of length < œÄ on a unit sphere S2 in a Euclidean three-dimensional space. Two such arcs are deemed equivalent if by sliding one along its great circle it can be made to coincide with the other.N. Mukunda, Rajiah Simon and George Sudarshan (1989) \\"The theory of screws: a new geometric representation for the group SU(1,1), Journal of Mathematical Physics 30(5): 1000‚Äì1006 On a great circle of a sphere, two directed circular arcs are equipollent when they agree in direction and arc length. An equivalence class of such arcs is associated with a quaternion versor :\\\\exp(a r) = \\\\cos a + r \\\\sin a , where a is arc length and r determines the plane of the great circle by perpendicularity.

Founded as a state-run company under communist rule and named after the 19th- century writer Ion CreangƒÉ, it ranked high among Romanian publishers of children's literature, fantasy literature and science fiction. Its activity resulted in many Romanian-language translations of world children's classics, among which were bestselling versions of Jules Verne's complete works and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. The company also stood at the core of a phenomenon in local book illustration, assigning contracts to recognized artists such as Sandu Florea, Val Munteanu, L√≠via Rusz and Eugen Taru. During the late years of communism, the enterprise was subject to the intervention of official censorship. In 1988, its publishing of Ana Blandiana's poems, which featured allusions to the communist system, resulted in culturally repressive measures personally ordered by President and Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. Editura Ion CreangƒÉ survived the 1989 Revolution, but was no longer able to compete with rival companies. It effectively ceased its activity during 2003. History Beginnings and consolidation Founded in 1969, the publishing house established its reputation during the following two decades. Among its early employees were poet Gheorghe Zarafu, who presided over the enterprise for a while in the 1970s, Raluca Anamaria Vida, \\"L'√éle myst√©rieuse - Insula misterioasƒÉ comme paradigme du ph√©nomene retraductif roumain dans le cas de Jules Verne\\", in Caietele Echinox, Vol. 9, 2005, at the Babe»ô-Bolyai University's Center for Imagination Studies and writer Tiberiu Utan, who was himself manager of the group in the same decade. Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rfi-De√°k, \\"Cu ochii copiilor, pentru bucuria lor\\" , in Caiete Silvane , June 2009 Writer and translator Adrian Solomon argued that, \\"with a few obnoxious exceptions\\", Editura Ion CreangƒÉ mostly published works which generally avoided or went beyond the propaganda characteristics found in Eastern Bloc literature aimed at adults.Adrian Solomon, \\"The Truth About Romania's Children\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 30/2007 According to his assessment, while some of the books issued preferred for publishing aimed at attacking \\"bourgeois\\" society, even they were ambiguous and may not have contributed to indoctrination beyond the facade aspects. From early on, the publishing house became an important venue for the Romanian school of book illustration. According to visual artist and journalist Cristiana Radu, the company stood for a \\"richer and more colorful\\" tradition of visual art for children, which \\"paradoxically\\" thrived under the communist period. Cristina Radu, \\"Ilustra»õia de carte. Un domeniu minor?\\", in Ziarul Financiar, February 27, 2009 In her assessment: \\"Perhaps also because reality was grayer and more deprived of visual stimuli, the books themselves worked as aesthetic markers. The books which have lit my childhood often crossed the borders, were taken into consideration by foreign editors, reaching countries such as France. During those years, Romania was the country of its area with the richest tradition in this field.\\" Writing in 2007, Arina Stoenescu, herself an illustrator, recalled the contributions of Rusz, Munteanu and Taru as a defining element of her own childhood reading experience.Arina Stoenescu, \\"All Those Images\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 30/2007 She argued: \\"The logotype of Ion CreangƒÉ Publishing House became a well known symbol, the distinguishing mark of many books with excellent pictures.\\" Enlisted by Utan, Rusz contributed drawings to reprints of classical works for children in Romanian literature, such as Nicolae Constantin Batzaria's Pove»ôti de aur (\\"Golden Stories\\") and CreangƒÉ's collected fairy tales and Childhood Memories. The latter edition is deemed \\"legendary\\" by author Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rfi-De√°k. After 1971, the company also issued Caseta cu bucurii (\\"A Caseful of Joys\\" or \\"My Bedtime Library\\"), the main works for children by Emil G√¢rleanu, with illustrations by Ileana Ceau»ôu- Pandele.Emil G√¢rleanu. Bibliografie, p.15-16, 19, 20 Some projects of the period recovered the legacy of Romanian Surrealism. One notable Editura Ion CreangƒÉ edition was Iordan Chimet's Cele 12 luni ale visului.

Simona Vasilache, \\"E corul de CrƒÉciun\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 51-52/2008 In addition to encouraging artistic expression in regular book illustration, Editura Ion CreangƒÉ played a part in promoting Romanian comic book authors. Among them was Sandu Florea, known for his work in science fiction comics, and who allegedly became the first local comics author to make a living exclusively from his art. Petrina Calabalic, \\"Cartoon Man\\" , in BƒÉnƒÉ»õeanul, December 6, 2004 In 1974, Ion CreangƒÉ also published Mircea Possa's TitilicƒÉ, bƒÉiat fƒÉrƒÉ fricƒÉ (\\"TitilicƒÉ, a Fearless Boy\\"), which some regard as one of the best Romanian comic books in its generation. Drago»ô Cojocaru, \\"Brigada Desenatorilor pune publicul √Æn alertƒÉ\\", in Ziarul de Ia»ôi, February 2, 2010 Translation projects A significant portion of the group's activities was dedicated to translations from foreign literature, some of which marked important moments in local editorial history. Such milestones included several editions of Leon Levi»õchi's translation from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver, called \\"without doubt the best of all [Romanian Gulliver editions] so far\\" by scholar Mihaela Mudure,Mihaela Mudure, \\"From the Infantile to the Subversive: Swift's Romanian Adventures\\", in Hermann J. Real (ed.), The Reception of Jonathan Swift in Europe, Continuum International Publishing Group, New York City, 2005, p.254. as well as Wilhelm Hauff's M√§rchen (Basme, illustrated by Rusz) and, in a \\"richly illustrated edition\\" of 1978, J.

Diana Soare, \\"Pove»ôti de adormit pƒÉrin»õii.

Constantin VicƒÉ, \\"Note, site-uri, ru»ôi\\", in Dilemateca, July 2010 A notable series inaugurated by the company was the Jules Verne \\"yellow covers\\" reader, published as a set of 40 volumes bound in boards and illustrated with copies of the original French lithographs. As noted by Zarafu, management decided in favor of the oldest illustrations only because their copyright had expired. Corneliu Apetroaiei, \\"Eternul Jules Verne\\", in Clujeanul, April 12, 2005 The Verne books were all bestsellers by Romanian standards, reportedly selling on average some 200,000 copies per issue. Among these volumes, linguist Raluca Anamaria Vida chose as a study case Insula misterioasƒÉ (\\"The Mysterious Island\\"), translated by Veronica and Ion MihƒÉileanu. Contrasting it to previous translations from the 1950s, Vida argued that the MihƒÉileanus' work was better suited to the original text. She also analyzed the relative liberalization that had occurred in the meantime, noting that the new version was more accepting of Verne's references to religion, and lacked the \\"ridiculous footnotes\\" which encouraged the reader to interpret the text from a Marxist-Leninist perspective. Also in the \\"yellow covers\\" series was Vladimir Colin's translation of Carpathian Castle, a book set in Transylvania and having ethnic Romanians among its protagonists. Colin's rendition, in part a retranslation, parted with other Romanian versions. These had noted Verne's use of obscure words to designate places and names as his approximate renditions of Romanian, and had sought to reconstruct them into readable Romanian; instead, Colin preferred to observe the original spelling throughout. Richard Wagner, \\"Arcul Carpatic. Topos, logo, ideolegmƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 867, October 2006 In 1975, Editura Ion CreangƒÉ also published the first Romanian version of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, translated from English by Catinca Ralea, and carrying the title O poveste cu un hobbit (\\"A Story with a Hobbit\\"). According to journalist Adina Popescu, Ralea's text was \\"excellent\\", and the volume itself stood among \\"the fundamental books of the last generation to have lived its childhood during communism.\\" Adina Popescu, \\"Literatura imaginarului\\", in Dilema Veche, Vol. III, Nr. 115, April 2006 O poveste cu un hobbit featured original illustrations by Rusz, who relied exclusively on her imagination for depicting the main characters, as the lack of Tolkien editions in Romania made it impossible for her to find other points of visual reference. Her contribution has nevertheless earned her an international profile among Tolkien illustrators. In additions to adaptations into Romanian, Editura Ion CreangƒÉ was noted for a state-assigned translation program into minority languages, specifically Hungarian (for Hungarian-Romanians) and German (for German- Romanians).

These activities also incorporated a political aspect: a 1975 official report on cultural policies, which listed Ion CreangƒÉ alongside Editura Dacia and Kriterion as the year's most significant contributors to the program, explained the role it had in the \\"communist education of readers\\". The group was also active in circulating translated Romanian works for children within the wider world: from 1971, Caseta cu bucurii and some of G√¢rleanu's other works were also issued in German, Hungarian, English, Swedish and Czech.Emil G√¢rleanu. Bibliografie, p.16-19, 20-22 A 1986 Spanish edition, titled Mi biblioteca para leer, was published in cooperation with Cuba's Editorial Gente Nueva.Emil G√¢rleanu. Bibliografie, p.22 Communist pressures and Arpagic scandal Progressively in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Ion CreangƒÉ's projects often stood in contrast with the tightening of political pressures and the economic decline. According to Arina Stoenescu: \\"By the end of the communist era, when the poor quality of paper and print made the pictures in fiction literature almost unintelligible, the strong colors and powerful black and white illustrations managed to reach the children and offered them a friendlier and happier sight of the world.\\" Looking back on the same interval and the successful Verne collection, writer Ion Hobana noted: \\"In the '80s, reading was the only way to make one's spare time informative and entertaining. Many have [since] forgotten that all they could watch on television amounted to a daily two-hour program, never mind the content...\\" In the final decade of communist rule, Editura Ion CreangƒÉ published some works of propaganda for the youth, including communist education teaching aides by Tudor Opri»ôIoan Stanomir, \\"Un pƒÉm√Ænt numit Rom√¢nia\\", in Paul Cernat, Angelo Mitchievici, Ioan Stanomir, ExplorƒÉri √Æn comunismul rom√¢nesc, Polirom, Ia»ôi, 2008, p.275-276. and Maria Obaciu.Ioan Stanomir, \\"Un om √Æntre oameni\\", in Paul Cernat, Ion Manolescu, Angelo Mitchievici, Ioan Stanomir, ExplorƒÉri √Æn comunismul rom√¢nesc, Polirom, Ia»ôi, 2004, p.421. Additionally, the publishing house felt the tightening of censorship, a policy encouraged by communist leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. A notable incident took place in 1988, when Editura Ion CreangƒÉ and poet Ana Blandiana became involved in a political scandal involving the highest levels of communist power. Having debuted in children's poetry with the fascicle √ént√ÆmplƒÉri din grƒÉdina mea (\\"Incidents in My Garden\\"), Irina Munteanu, \\"Amintirile Anei Blandiana\\", in Jurnalul Na»õional, April 13, 2005 Blandiana followed up with Alte √Ænt√ÆmplƒÉri din grƒÉdina mea (\\"Some Other Incidents in My Garden\\") and √ént√ÆmplƒÉri de pe strada mea (\\"Incidents on My Street\\"). The latter transformed its hero, Arpagic the Cat, into a satirical depiction of Ceau»ôescu, in particular by introducing oblique references to the leader's personality cult and propaganda system.Ilie Rad, \\"The 'Stylistics' of Censorship\\", in the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Centre for Political Analysis' East, Nr. 3 Luiza Vasiliu, \\"Motanul »ôi dictatorul\\" , in Steaua, Nr. 2-3/2008 (republished by the Romanian Cultural Institute's Rom√¢nia CulturalƒÉ ) The public followed up on the hint, and a number of clandestine jokes surfacing at the time reportedly referred to Ceau»ôescu as \\"Arpagic\\". Censors deciphered these messages only after the volume's release, and reported the matter to Ceau»ôescu personally, leading to an almost complete ban on Blandiana's work. The Securitate secret police oversaw further punitive measures, forcing the early retirement of Editura Ion CreangƒÉ's chief manager Viniciu Gafi»õa and moving proofreader Doina Mandaj, stripped of her political position, to the Albatros group. In the short interval before √ént√ÆmplƒÉri de pe strada mea was withdrawn from shops, rumors spread about the irritation it caused to communist authorities, and, as a consequence, sales increased significantly. Final years The publishing house survived the December 1989 Revolution which toppled communism. Around the year 2000, it was managed by poet Daniela CrƒÉsnaru. It was at the time openly engaged in the process of recovering anti-communist literature, publishing a diary of Gulag imprisonment, by the Bessarabian author Naum V. Lospa. Iulia Argint, \\"Lecturi la zi\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 33/2003 The company faced competition from newly founded independent publishers of children's books, and remained the only publisher in this class to receive subventions from the Ministry of Culture.United Nations, Committee on the Rights of the Child, Consideration of the Reports Submitted by States Parties under Article 44 of the Convention.

Florentina CioacƒÉ, \\"AVAS a decis √Æncetarea monitorizƒÉrii postprivatizare la nouƒÉ societƒÉ»õi\\", in AdevƒÉrul, November 9, 2009 Editura Ion CreangƒÉ effectively closed down, even though the privatization monitoring case was only sealed in November 2009. Comparing the book illustration scene at Ion CreangƒÉ with the post-1989 situation, Cristiana Radu contended that new publishers resorted to \\"traditional, tame and descriptive variants\\" or \\"the Disney solution\\", while the public was left without \\"visual education\\". In later years, Editura Ion CreangƒÉ editions became involved in debates about intellectual property and copyright infringement in respect to communist-era works. Humanitas consortium released, in 2003 and 2010, new versions of Nosov's Habarnam; a controversy was sparked when Humanitas demanded the closure of Romania's Nosov fansite, which, claiming that the communist copyright law was void, had digitized the 1986 edition.

It was located north of West Haverstraw; east of Harriman State Park; south of Stony Point. History Chrystenah Grassy Point is a short peninsula extending into the Hudson River in the southeast part of the Town of Stony Point. In 1798 William Denning Sr., a wealthy New York lawyer, purchased the land. He later sold 10 acres (40,000 m2) at the south end of the property to another New York lawyer, William Smith, who built a large two story house and named it \\"Rosa Villa\\".Green, Frank Bertangue. \\"Grassy Point\\", History of Rockland County, A. S. Barnes & Co., New York 1886 After the death of Denning, his property passed through the hands of Philip Verplanck, Isaac L. Pratt and Dr. Lawrence Proudfoot. In 1830 Proudfoot built the first steamboat landing at Grassy Point. Owing to the depth of water, it was the stopping place for steamers passing up and down the river. The first hotel at Grassy Point was kept by Dr. Proudfoot in a double house near the steamboat wharf. On the north side of that house was a small addition in which Proudfoot kept a small store and bar, and in which the first post office was opened. The first post office at Grassy Point was opened on July 30, 1834, with James De La Montanya as postmaster. On August 21, 1834, the name of the office was changed to North Haverstraw, and it retained this name until September l0th, 1836, when it was changed back to Grassy Point. On September 5, 1845, the office was discontinued. The post office at Grassy Point was re-established with Alfred M. Wiles as postmaster on April 14, 1871. In June 1831, the steamboat General Jackson, owned by Jacob Vanderbilt, and plying between New York and Peekskill, blew up at Grassy Point. The boat was later rebuilt and subsequently sold to David P. Mapes who used it on the Kingston-New York run. In 1845, O. C. Gerow opened a general country store in a building a few feet west of Proudfoot's house. In 1848, James Creney opened a hotel at the Point. The first lumber yard at the Point was started by Walter Fleet Brewster Gurnee & A. Gurnee and George H. Smith. In the spring of 1845, John I. Wiles moved from Orange County to Grassy Point with his family, and opened a shop for the purpose of doing blacksmith or wheelwright work. In 1871, a foundry was built which manufactured machinery for flour and saw mills and brick making. The number of vessels engaged in the transportation of brick from the county made marine railways and ship yards near Haverstraw a necessity. In the autumn of 1883, George L. Wicks started a yard at Grassy Point where the depth of water was favorable, and put down a marine railway. In 1889 St. Joseph‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church was established under the direction of Rev.

It was part of a much larger community that included a general store, a foundry, two hotels, a firehouse, a school and a bakery. The brick industry was the area's main business.

Penny Bridge was constructed at the point where the Minisceongo and Cedar Pond Creeks meet the Hudson River.\\"Penny Bridge, Grassy Point\\", Hudson River Valley Heritage In order to accommodate the barges and sloops that serviced the factories, a movable span was installed, so well balanced on its central gear that it could be turned by one man with nothing more than a wrench.

He went on to captain his country's team, and later was instrumental in establishing the sport in the south of New Zealand and in British Columbia. Biography Alfred Hamersley was born in Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, the son of Hugh Hamersley JP, DL (1813‚Äì1884) and Mary Anne Phillpa Edwards (d. 1877). Initially living at Haseley House, Great Haseley, he moved to Church Manor House, Pyrton, Oxford prior to 1861 where his father had inherited the manor that had been in the family since 1781. Alfred was not to inherit the manor. Rather, it passed to his younger brother Edward Samuel in 1884 at which time Alfred was living in New Zealand. Pyrton manor did not revert to the older line of Alfred, but rather in 1909, Edward's widow gave the manor to the son of her husband's sister, Major Hugh C. C. Ducat, who took the name Ducat Hamersley and whose son, Colonel Hugh Ducat Hamersley, inherited in 1945.

After finishing his education moved to London where he became a Barrister-at- law in the Middle Temple in 1872. In 1874 he emigrated to New Zealand where he married Miss Isabella Snow of Wellington. Here he practiced law for about 15 years in South Canterbury. He also took a particular interest in military matters, taking command a battery of artillery and appointed to a command a contingent at Parihaka on the last outbreak of trouble between MƒÅori and pƒÅkehƒÅ in the North Island. He is created with introducing the game of rugby to the youth of South Canterbury.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat;=19290227&id;=AxoTAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=vJYDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5460,754582 He also founded the New Zealand Grand National Steeplechase Club. In 1888 he and his family moved to Vancouver where he is credited as being the city's first solicitor. He became legal advisor to Vancouver City Corporation and was active in local business and athletics. As in New Zealand his zeal for rugby led to him joining the Vancouver Football (Rugby) Club and he eventually became the first president of the British Columbia Rugby Union at its inaugural meeting in 1889. His sporting interests went beyond rugby and he also founded the Amateur Athletic Club of British Columbia. He ceased to practise law in British Columbia when, in the Vancouver Courts an act abolishing the use of wigs in Court was passed. As a strong supporter of everything British, Hamersley's opinion was that this was an American innovation and one he refused to honour. It was in Vancouver that he became interested in real estate and bought of land, sub-divided it and attracted settlers to an area now known as North Vancouver on the other side of the Burrard Inlet. For this reason the first municipal ferry was named 'St George' in his honour. He also once sold some Mount Pleasant property to the writer Rudyard Kipling, a fellow freemason. It is said that on one occasion when Rudyard Kipling paid him a visit he found a note pinned to Hamersley's door saying 'Out on Business', a private joke because 'Business' was the name of his horse. Between 1903 and 1905 he had built an estate home in North Vancouver which still stands today having been designated in 1977 by the city as 'Heritage' to recognize its distinguished history. Alfred St George Hamersley in military uniform In 1905, he decided to retire back to England and a banquet was held on the eve of his departure at the North Vancouver Hotel. At the banquet Hamersley's speech was marked out by his professing the virtues of sport and its benefits to both community and the British Empire. He said that \\"The social side of life and sport were infinitely better than stem officialdom to build up a community. To build North Vancouver as she ought to be money was nothing compared with good fellowship, manliness and the love of sport. Were all brought up in a manly way they could play the game and play it well. If we can in our little community infuse manliness of sport and square dealing we would be helping the empire as a whole.\\" On his return to England in 1905 he soon became a well-known figure in Oxfordshire, due in the main to his electioneering on behalf of the Conservative and Unionist Party, in an attempt to become Member of Parliament for Mid-Oxon. His connections to his home county were emphasised prior to his addressing a public meeting at Alvescot in January 1908. He was described as \\"an Oxfordshire man born and bred:- his father was one of the best known County men having been Chairman of the Quarter Sessions and closely connected with all public work. His family had been connected with Oxfordshire for many generations - whatever he had done in different parts of the Empire all his better aspirations were drawn from his own home and his love of Oxfordshire.\\" Hamersley, after a long promotional campaign, was on 22 January 1910 elected Unionist MP for Mid Oxfordshire, Woodstock which he held until the constituency was abolished in 1918. In addition to his political aspirations, he remained heavily involved in rugby union and was instrumental in helping to form the Oxfordshire Nomads Rugby Union Football Club in 1909, which would later become Oxford RFC. He stated that when the idea was brought to his notice he was surprised no such club already existed in the city and therefore he determined to do everything he could to forward the project. He acted as Chairman at the inaugural meeting at the Clarendon Hotel, in Commarket, and in so doing immediately gave the club gravitas. When the meeting arrived at the point to elect officers he was unanimously asked to become President of the club, and he accepted the honour, assuring those present that he would take a keen interest in the newly formed club. In his acceptance he said that although in England Association Football had caught the popular fancy, \\"the soccer game was not to be compared with the Rugby code. There was no better game in the world than Rugby.\\" He was also a dedicated and active patron of the Headington Silver Band from 1911 until his death. At the outbreak of the war Hamersley was carrying the rank of Colonel. Although 66 years old, he was asked by the Army Council to form a heavy battery for service during the Great War, the Headquarters of which were taken at Exeter College, Oxford. The battery was started in February 1915 but it was not until March 1916 that they were drafted overseas. Colonel Hamersley, now in his sixty-eighth year gave over the command to a younger man, Major Drought and the Batteries were commended by the authorities for their efficiency in battles such as the Somme, Arras and Ypres. The Great War claimed twenty-six England internationals but the game bounced back quickly and in the 1921 season, in which England gained their third 'Grand Slam', the Scotland-England match at Inverleith provided the opportunity for the English and Scottish Rugby Unions to celebrate the Jubilee of the first ever International in 1871. As one of the sixteen survivors of that first match, Hamersley was invited to the match and the team's dinner afterwards to join the celebrations. Hamersley commitment to his Oxfordshire Heavy Batteries was unstinting and on 15 October 1926, in the Oxford Times he announced that arrangements had been made for a memorial to be erected to commemorate the services rendered by four Oxfordshire Heavy Batteries in the Great War, and the memory of those who fell. In a very short period of time, on 28 November 1926, 150 men marched from St Giles, headed by the 4th Battalion Oxfordshire and Bucks Light Infantry Band, to the Town Hall in Oxford where, before several hundred local people and several local dignitaries, Colonel Hamersley invited the Duke of Marlborough to unveil the memorial tablet bearing the inscription: \\"Oxfordshire Heavy Batteries (128th, 132nd, 135th, 156th) Royal Artillery. These batteries were raised and recruited in the City and County of Oxford for service overseas in the Great War. They served in France from March 1916 until the end of the War with great distinction. Many most gloriously fell. This tablet has been erected to their undying memory.\\" In his last years Hamersley had been living in Bournemouth where the sea air was felt to be beneficial. There he died on 25 February 1929.Richard Tyrrell, Green, White & Black, the story of Oxford RFC, Stray Cat Publishing Rugby union 1871 England squad with Nomads player Alfred St. George Hamersley highlighted Hamersley had played football under the Marlborough College interpretation of rugby school rules and upon leaving education and moving to London, joined the once famous, but then newly established Marlborough Nomads. He was described as a tall, powerful forward, with a reputation for working tirelessly in the scrum and \\"first-rate at getting the ball on its being thrown out from touch\\".Marshall, Francis, Football; the Rugby union game, p144, (1892) (London Paris Melbourne, Cassell and company, limited) He was selected to play in England's first international in 1871 and played in each annual international fixture in the first four years of international rugby. His captain for the first three games was Frederick Stokes and with his retirement after the 1873 match, Hamersley was made captain in 1874, making him England's second rugby union captain. This proved to be his final appearance for England at international level. Soon after the match against Scotland in 1874 he emigrated to New Zealand. There he practised law but continued to indulge his passion for rugby by helping to establish the game in the South Island of New Zealand. He was one of the founders of the South Canterbury Football Club, the Canterbury Rugby Union and then the South Canterbury Rugby Union. Hamersley's pivotal role in the history of rugby in the region was commemorated in 2010 with the introduction of the Hamersley trophy, a tall silver trophy, for the winners of the senior rugby competition of South Canterbury. It was commented that his departure for New Zealand \\"did much towards improving the colonists' game [but] was a great loss to England\\". After fifteen years in New Zealand he moved to Canada in 1889. Once again he proved to be rugby union missionary by helping to found Vancouver RFC and he was the first president of the British Columbia Rugby Union. Personal life Hamersley married Isabella Maud Snow in 1876. Isabella was born 1853, the daughter of Charles Hastings Snow and christened in Winterborne Stickland, Dorset. She lived to be 102, dying on 27 January 1955.

It is approximately north-northeast of Paris. Its history begins before World War II when it was originally a grass civil airdrome. During the German occupation of France (1940‚Äì1944), the Luftwaffe developed the airdrome into a major military airfield. Attacked frequently by Allied Air Forces, the Luftwaffe base was seized by Allied Ground Forces in September 1944 and was used as a Fighter and bomber base by the United States Army Air Force until the end of the war. It was redeveloped in the 1950s as a NATO Dispersed Operating Base and was closed in 1967. Today, it is mostly agricultural fields, and also a power-generating wind farm, with several electric generating windmills. History Clastres Airport was a pre-World War II civil airport, consisting of a terminal, hangar, some support buildings and a grass airfield, serving the nearby city of Saint-Quentin. German use during World War II It was seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the early part of the Battle of France. It was briefly used as a fighter airfield by Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) and Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52) in early June 1940, participating in the Blitzkrieg against the French Army and British Expeditionary Force flying Messerschmitt Bf 109Es. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 Clastres was unused during the balance of 1940 and 1941 and 1942. In 1943, the Germans laid down two 1800m all-weather concrete runways at the airport, aligned 05/23 and 10/29. Presumably, this was due to the fortification of the Pas-de-Calais, being believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have a key role in the defense of France. In early February 1944, Clastres became a day interceptor airfield that housed fighters to attack the USAAF Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fleets attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany. Known units assigned (all from Luftlotte 3, Fliegerkorps IV): * Schlachtgeschwader 4 (SG 4) February-6 June 1944 Focke-Wulf Fw 190F/G * Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) 6 June-28 August 1944 Focke-Wulf Fw 190A The Fw 190F/G were derivatives of the Fw 190A, however, had been configured to have a dive- bombing capability. However, in the interceptor role, they were faster and had longer range than the Fw 190A. Previously not attacked by Allied bombers, Clastres came under frequent attack by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) Also, as part of Operation Quicksilver, which was designed to deceive the Germans about where the invasion of France would take place, Clastres was attacked by Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber groups in early June 1944, just prior to the D-Day landings in Normandy.USAFHRA Document 00208699 American use American Ninth Army units moved through the area in early September 1944, heading towards Saint-Quentin. On 7 September The IX Engineer Command 846th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began a quick rehabilitation of the base so it could be used by American aircraft. It was declared operationally ready for Ninth Air Force combat units on 9 September, only a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-71 Clastres Airfield\\"IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout In addition to the airfield, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. It hosted the following known units:Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. .Johnson, David C.

Postwar use In French control after the war, the airport sat abandoned for several years. There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and American aircraft. Many of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the war, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. There was no use for the prewar airport, and as a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. NATO use In 1950 when as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the air base at Clastres was offered to the United States Air Force by the French Air Ministry as part of their NATO commitment to establish a modern Air Force Base at the site. NATO faced several problems when attempting to solve the air power survival equation. Planning for a Warsaw Pact first strike survival in both conventional and nuclear wars had to be considered. The main air bases were built on small parcels of land with very limited dispersal space. It was decided to use Clastres as a NATO Dispersed Operating Base, be used in the event of an emergency. The goal was to have no more than one fighter squadron on each main or dispersed base in the event of war. Beginning in 1953, the wartime wreckage was finally cleared from the base and construction was begun. French Army Explosive demolition teams were brought in to safely remove unexploded ordnance remaining from the war and the site was prepared for construction. A modern all-weather concrete NATO jet runway was laid down aligned 02/20, with taxiways and dispersal areas for three fighter squadrons. The dispersals were designed in a circular marguerite system of hardstands which could be revetted later with earth for added aircraft protection. Typically the margueriete consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands, with each hardstand capable of parking one or two aircraft, allowing the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate margueriete, with space for about 50 fighters. Other than the occasional touch-and-go landing of NATO (USAF) aircraft, Saint-Simon ‚Äì Clastres Air Base was never used. With the French withdrawal from the integrated military component of NATO in 1967, the base was abandoned.McAuliffe, Jerome J (2005): U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967, Chapter 17, Dispersed Operating Bases Current use In the 40 years since its closure, the base has been primarily used for agriculture. The NATO concrete runway, taxiways and marguerites remain, all in reasonable condition. A windmill farm has been constructed on the north end of the airfield, along with what appear to be two or three race cart tracks inside the grassy areas of the northern marguerites. In recent years, a coating over the concrete appears to have been laid down on the main runway and taxiway. between the dispersal areas, and perhaps may be used for light aircraft, probably agricultural. The only visible remaining feature of the wartime airfield is a section of the 10/29 east-west runway. The concrete is deteriorated with large breaks in the expansion joints visible, however part of the runway has also been resurfaced to the east side of the NATO runway, and a small metal structure, probably used for agriculture has been erected on the 29 end by a local access road from the village of Clastres, just to the southeast of the airfield.

Naval career  Curtis William Howard was born to Captain and Mrs. Jasper V. Howard (Medical Corps), USN, on Guam on 31 August 1917. He was appointed a midshipman from the State of California on 4 June 1934 and attended the United States Naval Academy. While there, he boxed, earning him the nickname \\"Punchy\\", and contemporaries considered him \\"possessed of a good sense of humor, exceptional perscipacity, and an able brain,\\" who \\"promises to become an apt officer\\". Graduating with the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1938, Howard received his commission as an ensign on 2 June 1938. Howard reported to the heavy cruiser USS Pensacola (CA-24) on 30 June 1938, and served aboard her until 11 September 1939. On 19 September 1939, he reported to the destroyer USS Greer (DD-145) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Greer was undergoing preparations for recommissioning on 4 October 1939 to become a part of the Neutrality Patrol ordered soon after World War II began in Europe. Detached from Greer on 5 July 1940, Ensign Howard reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida, on 29 July 1940 to commence flight \\"instruction in heavier-than-air craft.\\" He continued \\"duty involving flying under instruction\\" there, and, ultimately, was designated a naval aviator on 23 January 1941. Detached from Naval Air Station Pensacola on 7 February 1941, he then served at Naval Air Station Miami at Miami, Florida, from 25 March 1941 to 7 April 1941, after which he reported to Torpedo Squadron 3, assigned to the air group of the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-3), on 7 April 1941. On 8 October 1941, he was promoted to lieutenant, junior grade, to rank from 8 June 1941. The United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941. After an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine torpedoed Saratoga on 11 January 1942 and Saratogas subsequent departure for repairs at Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington, Torpedo Squadron 3 was based ashore, first at Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, standing alert duty for defense of the island of Oahu, then at Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, whence the squadron trained and continued to stand alerts. On 30 May 1942, assigned to the air group of the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-5), replacing Torpedo Squadron 5 aboard that carrier, Torpedo Squadron 3 flew on board as Yorktown departed Pearl Harbor to participate in what would become known as the Battle of Midway. During that battle, on 4 June 1942, Yorktown launched Torpedo Squadron 3 and Bombing Squadron 3, covered by fighters from Fighting Squadron 3, to attack the Japanese aircraft carrier force in concert with a strike from aircraft carriers USS Enterprise (CV-6) and USS Hornet (CV-8). Circumstances, however, dictated that only the Yorktown Air Group attacked as a unit, with Torpedo Squadron 3 following Torpedo Squadron 8 and Torpedo Squadron 6 as the last of the three torpedo squadrons to execute their brave low-level attacks. Japanese Mitsubishi A6M2 Type 00 carrier fighters, however, overwhelmed the six-plane Fighting Squadron 3 covering element, and, in concert with heavy antiaircraft fire from the Japanese aircraft carriers and their screening ships, shot down ten of the twelve Torpedo Squadron 3 Douglas TBD-1 Devastator torpedo bombers. Howard, piloting one of the Devastators, and his radio gunner, Aviation Radioman 3rd Class Charles L. Moore, perished in the attack.  Awards  Howard was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for his \\"self-sacrificing gallantry and fortitude...in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service...\\"  Namesake  The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Curtis W. Howard (DE-752), launched in 1944 but never completed, was named for Lieutenant, junior grade, Howard.

Jewish neopaganism Chai seen in Jewitchery The notion of historical Israelite or Jewish polytheism was popularized in the United States during the 1960s by Raphael Patai in The Hebrew Goddess, focusing on the cult of female goddesses such as the cult of Asherah in Solomon's Temple. During the growth of Neopaganism in the United States throughout the 1970s, a number of minor Canaanite or Israelite oriented groups emerged. Most contained syncretistic elements from Western esotericism. Forms of witchcraft religions inspired by the Semitic milieu, such as Jewitchery, may also be enclosed within the Semitic neopagan movement. These groups are particularly influenced by Jewish feminism, focusing on the goddess cults of the Israelites.Jenny Kien, Reinstating the Divine Woman in Judaism (2000), .

Historical context Although the movie correctly depicts the Lufthansa Heist, showing Jimmy Burke as the leader of a crew linked to Paulie Vario, the crew wasn't part of the Gambino family as depicted, but rather was a large part of the Lucchese crime family, and the robbery brought a large quantity of funding for Tony Corallo. Although Burke did have connections with John Gotti, Gotti was never involved with the Lufthansa Heist nor did he want to be a part of it. According to a rumour, on an FBI wire tap from the 1980s years after the original heist, Gotti was heard to say to underboss and his capo Aniello Dellacroce: \\"I didn't want any part of that shit that Burke and those other fucks pulled. Only micks would do something crazy like this. Micks are fucking crazy; end of fucking statement\\". It was also alleged by Hill, in Hill's book The Lufthansa Heist that John Gotti personally killed Tommy DeSimone, a member of the actual stick-up crew.

The motion picture is the first independent work of Pudovkin as a director and also marks the start of his collaboration with cinematographer Anatoli Golovnya. Pudovkin joined Mezhrabpom-Rus film studio in 1925 and, as his first job, was assigned to make a popular science film about Ivan Pavlov's work. The filming started in May 1925 and proceeded for more than a year. The many delays were caused by constant shuttling between the Pavlov's laboratory in Leningrad and the film studio in Moscow as well as difficulties with filming conditioned animals who were easily distracted by the lights and sounds of filming process.

The company was founded in 2006 and incorporated as Zingerang, Inc. Originally, the company was involved in mobile communication, but has since switched to developing to fuel technology. Calcium Carbonate, CaCO3, was briefly looked at as another end product of recycling. On April 2, 2007 the name was changed to Carbon Sciences Inc. Their process differs from other projects in that it does not utilize high pressure or high temperature. This would be a significant advantage when trying to scale the technology up to commercial production. Technology Byron Elton, the CEO and President of Carbon Sciences, explained in a report with Newsweek that they are in the developmental stages of a carbon recycling technology that involves capturing the greenhouse gas, , and transforming it into gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, methanol, propane, and butane. The main process involves taking the oxygen molecules out of water and carbon dioxide in a biocatalytic process. The remaining carbon monoxide and hydrogen are then combined to make basic hydrocarbons using the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process. These hydrocarbons are then transformed into a variety of fuels. In the early stages of the technology the process required pure carbon dioxide and pure water. However, updates to the technology will allow it to be placed at the output of a large emitter, such as a power plant, where many other elements and compounds are present. Their catalyst was developed in partnership with the University of Saskatchewan. If the methane is obtained from a landfill, the process would completely utilize recycled compounds. The end product would be much cleaner than natural fuels because it would not contain smog-causing air pollutants. An application has been sent in for funding from the Department of Energy under the category 'Innovative Concepts for Beneficial Uses of ' and a patent application has been submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Similar technology is also being developed at the Sandia National Laboratories and at a joint venture between UOP LLC and the University of Southern California. Robert Boyce, an editor for the New York Times, challenged the wisdom of carbon capture asserting that is an energy-intensive process and \\"unlike natural gas, carbon dioxide is a worthless waste product.\\" Elton responded with a letter that was published in both the print and online versions of the newspaper. In the letter he states \\"The problem with C.C.S. is not the C.C. (carbon capture), but the S. (storage). C.C.R., on the other hand (carbon capture and recycling), is a terrific bet on carbon.\\" He also added \\"Our -based technology is a radical departure from conventional GTL processes. We anticipate we will significantly reduce capital costs and be negative, two major current challenges.\\" After Carbon Sciences announced successful testing of their catalyst, Ariel Schwartz pointed out that until the project can be tested outside of a lab setting it is still a big \\"if\\".

He was the longtime general director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, which he founded in 1938. He also co-founded the LACLO's affiliate organization, the San Francisco Civic Light Opera, with Homer Curran in 1939. Under his leadership, the LACLO produced or co-produced several of their own shows, a number of which went on to wider success, including Song of Norway (1944), Magdalena (1948), Kismet (1953), Peter Pan (1954) and Gigi (1973). Lester also brought in shows from Broadway to California, often with their original casts. Biography Born in New York City, Lester worked professionally as a singer during his childhood and then had a brief career as a concert pianist. He moved to California to work for Sid Grauman at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood where he staged spectacle prologues in the late 1920s. In the early 1930s he worked as a talent manager for performers. In 1938 Lester founded the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera under the motto \\"Light Opera in the Grand Opera manner\\". The company opened its first season in 1938 with Franz Schubert's operetta Blossom Time, presented in English with stars John Charles Thomas and Francia White. The production was both a critical and financial success, and the company went on to have three more sold out productions that season with Sigmund Romberg's The Student Prince, Romberg's The New Moon, and Jerome Kern's Roberta.History of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera at broadwayla.org While including touring productions from NYC in their annual season, the LACLO still continued to mount their own locally produced productions under the artistic leadership of Lester. One major triumph for the company was the 1944 operetta Song of Norway which Lester commissioned Milton Lazarus, Robert Wright, and George Forrest to create using the music of Edvard Grieg. The production later went on to have a successful Broadway run. Wright and Forrest created several more original works for the LACLO, most notably the 1953 musical Kismet, which had an even greater success in New York. Perhaps the most successful original work to be produced at the LACLO was the 1954 musical version of Peter Pan which Lester orchestrated as a star vehicle for Mary Martin. After opening in Los Angeles, the production moved to Broadway, winning Martin a Tony Award. The LACLO also exported a number of revivals to Broadway during its history, including a 1945 revival of Victor Herbert's The Red Mill which ran for more than a year in New York. Lester retired as general director and producer of the LACLO in 1976. He continued on as a member of the LACLO and SFLOC boards until closing of the companies. The SFLOC closed in 1980 and the LACLO closed in 1987. He died at the age of 95 at his home in Beverly Hills.

The Canadian Bill of Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantee the right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause. That right is implemented by the Criminal Code, which provides several ways for a person to be released prior to a court appearance. A person may be released by a peace officer or by the courts. A release by the courts is officially known as a judicial interim release. There are also a number of ways to compel a person's appearance in court without the need for an arrest and release. History The Canadian law of bail is derived from the principles of bail which evolved in the English common law. In particular, the right to be released without excessive bail was enshrined in the English Bill of Rights,Bill of Rights (Eng.) 1 Will. & Mary, Sess. 2 (1688), c. 2. which was part of the law of the colonies in British North America. Prior to Confederation in 1867, the individual colonies each had the authority to enact local laws relating to bail. After 1867, the Parliament of Canada acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the criminal law,Constitution Act, 1867, s. 91(27). including the law of bail. The first major federal legislation with respect to bail was included in the criminal legislation package of 1869.An Act respecting the duties of Justices of the Peace, out of Sessions, in relation to persons charged with Indictable Offences, S.C. 1869, c. 30.Alan W. Mewett, \\"The Criminal Law, 1867-1967\\" (1967), 45 Canadian Bar Review 726, pp. 726-727. In that law, the federal government made bail discretionary for all offences. This provision was subsequently subject to much judicial interpretation, as it made the granting of bail highly discretionary for each justice of the peace. It also placed considerable emphasis on cash bail, making release on bail dependent on the individual's financial resources, rather than factors such as likelihood of appearing to answer the charges.M. L. Friedland, Detention before Trial: A Study of Criminal Cases Tried in the Toronto Magistrates‚Äô Courts (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1965), p. 176. The next major statutory change to bail in Canada was the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights which provided for a \\"right to reasonable bail\\".Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44, s. 2(f). This provision was subsequently used by the courts to rule, for the first time, that the Extradition Act included a right to bail.The Law of Bail in Canada, p. 15. In the early 1970s, the procedure for granting bail in Canada was completely revised by the Bail Reform Act, which extensively amended the bail provisions of the Criminal Code.The Law of Bail in Canada, p. i. This act placed the onus for justifying an accused's detention on the prosecutor, gave police new powers to release persons charged with an offence prior to their coming before a justice, and created detailed procedures for bail reviews.The Law of Bail in Canada, p. 12. In 1982, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms enshrined the right to bail in the Canadian constitution. Section 11(e) of the Charter stipulated that \\"any person charged with an offence has the right ... not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause\\".The Law of Bail in Canada, p. 16. This was subsequently used by the Supreme Court of Canada to strike out bail provisions of the Criminal Code which the court held to be excessively vague in R v Morales.  Process to compel attendance without an arrest  The Criminal Code provides two ways that a person can be brought before the courts without first requiring an arrest: an appearance notice, issued by the police officer, or a summons, issued by a Provincial Court judge or justice of the peace. Failure to comply with an appearance notice or summons can result in an arrest warrant being issued,Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 512(2). and possibly further charges for failure to appear or comply with conditions.Criminal Code, s. 145. Appearance notice In certain cases, a peace officer can choose to issue an appearance notice to a person, instead of arresting the person. There are three conditions for issuing an appearance notice: (1) the peace officer must have reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed a summary conviction offence, a hybrid offence, or an offence within the absolute jurisdiction of a judge of a Provincial Court,Criminal Code, s. 496. (2) be satisfied on reasonable grounds that an arrest is not necessary to establish the identity of the person, secure or preserve evidence, or prevent the continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence, and (3) there are no reasonable grounds to believe the person will fail to attend court.Criminal Code, s. 495(2). An appearance notice directs the accused to appear in court on a given date. When the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable offence, the appearance notice can also require the accused to report for fingerprinting and photographing under the Identification of Criminals Act.Criminal Code, s. 501. An appearance notice must be subsequently confirmed by a justice of the peace.Criminal Code, s. 508. Summons Alternatively, where a peace officer believes on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an indictable offence, the peace officer can lay an information before a Provincial Court judge or a justice of the peace. If the judge or justice of the peace is satisfied grounds exist, they can issue a summons requiring an accused to appear in court on a given date.Criminal Code, s. 507.Criminal Code, s. 509. The summons can also require the person to report for fingerprinting and photographing under the Identification of Criminals Act. Release by police after arrest Police officers have a number of options to release an accused subsequent to their arrest but without the accused having to attend court for a release hearing. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in an arrest warrant being issued, and possibly further charges for failure to appear or comply with conditions.  Release by arresting officer  The officer who arrests the person can release them on an appearance notice or with the intention to apply to a justice of the peace for a summons, as described above. Release by officer in charge Alternatively, the officer who arrests the person can take the person to the officer in charge of the facility where the person is being held, who then has powers to release the person. The release can include a requirement that the person appear for photographing and fingerprinting under the Identification of Criminals Act. Unlike the arresting officer, the officer in charge can impose additional conditions on the release in certain cases, in the form of undertakings.Criminal Code, s. 499. Summons or promise to appear The officer in charge can release the person with the intention to apply for a summons, or can issue a promise to appear, which is similar to an appearance notice.Criminal Code, s. 498. Recognizance The officer in charge can require the individual to enter into a recognizance, committing the person to pay up to $500 if the person fails to appear in court. No sureties are required. The person does not actually need to deposit the money with the officer in charge, unless the person is not ordinarily resident in the province or within 200 kilometres of the place of custody. Undertaking to an officer in charge The accused can enter into an undertaking to an officer in charge to abide by certain conditions while they are on a release, in addition to any other conditions of release. An undertaking can have one or more of the following conditions: *to remain within a territorial jurisdiction, *to notify the officer of any change of address, employment, or occupation, *to abstain from communicating directly or indirectly with certain individuals, *to abstain from attending certain locations, *to deposit their passport, *to abstain from possessing any firearm and to surrender any firearm licences, *to report at certain times to the police, *to abstain from the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances, *to abstain from the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription, and *to comply with any other condition the officer in charge considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any complainant or witness. Release hearing If the police do not release an arrested person, there must be a judicial hearing, formally known as an application for \\"judicial interim release\\". Depending on the circumstances and the offence, the hearing may be held before a justice of the peace, a Provincial Court judge, or a judge of the superior trial court of the province. The justice or judge can order the detention of the person, or the release on various conditions. Failure to comply with the conditions of release can result in an arrest warrant being issued,Criminal Code, s. 524. or additional charges for failure to appear or failure to comply with conditions. Timing The police must bring the arrested person before a justice of the peace (which can include a Provincial Court judge) without unreasonable delay and in any event within 24 hours of the arrest. If a justice is not available within 24 hours, the police must bring the person before a justice as soon as possible.Criminal Code, s. 503. The justice can then conduct a release hearing.Criminal Code, s. 515. The exception is if the person is charged with particularly serious offences, such as murder or treason. The justice of the peace must issue a warrant of committal, authorising detention until dealt with by a superior court trial judge. The hearing may be adjourned by the justice, or on the request of the arrested person or the Crown prosecutor or police officer. However, if the defence does not consent to the adjournment, the justice cannot adjourn the hearing for more than 3 days.Criminal Code, s. 516. If the hearing is adjourned, the justice may order the accused not to communicate with certain individuals while the accused is detained. Grounds for detention There are three different grounds for detaining an accused prior to sentence.Criminal Code, s. 515(10). They are commonly referred to as primary grounds, secondary grounds, and tertiary grounds. Primary grounds refers to whether detention is necessary to ensure the accused's attendance in court. Considerations include the accused's criminal history, their behaviour in the matter before the court, their connections (or lack of) with the jurisdiction, and the type of offences before the court. Secondary grounds refers to whether detention is necessary for the protection or safety of the public. This includes whether there is a substantial likelihood the accused will commit a further offence or interfere with the administration of justice. Tertiary grounds refers to whether detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, and is generally reserved for very serious offences. The four factors to consider are: *the apparent strength of the prosecutor's case, *the seriousness of the offence, *the circumstances surrounding the offence, including whether a firearm was used, and *if found guilty, whether the accused is liable to a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment, or if a firearm was involved, faces a minimum of 3 year of jail. Burden of proof Generally, the Crown prosecutor has the burden to show on a balance of probabilities why the accused should be detained. However, the prosecutor may consent to the release of an accused on conditions imposed by the justice. Similarly, the accused may concede that the prosecutor can show cause (or if the accused has the burden of proof, indicate they do want to show cause why they should be released) and consent to their detention. While the onus of proof is normally on the Crown prosecutor, the accused has the burden to show why they should be released, also known as \\"reverse onus\\" if they are charged with the following offences:Criminal Code, s. 515(6). *an offence committed while at large on a release, *an offence committed at the direction or in association with a criminal organization, *a terrorism offence, *certain offences under the Security of Information Act, *a weapons trafficking offence, *certain violent offences (including attempted murder) where a firearm was used, *an offence that involved a firearm, crossbow, restricted weapon, or prohibited weapon while under a weapons prohibition, *any offence if the accused is not an ordinary resident of Canada, *an offence of failing to comply with release conditions or failing to attend court, or *certain offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act that carry the possibility of a life sentence. If an accused is ordered detained, the court may order that they not communicate with certain individuals while they are in custody awaiting their trial and sentencing.Criminal Code, s. 515(12). Evidence The standard of evidence in a release hearing is trustworthy and credible, and can include hearsay. This can include a summary of the alleged offence and any witness statements. The court is allowed to consider other offences the accused has been charged with but is still awaiting trial for.Criminal Code, s. 518. As with all other criminal proceedings, it is optional for the accused to testify. If the accused does testify, they cannot be cross-examined on the offence before the court unless the accused testifies about the offence itself. This only applies to the offence the accused is charged with and not with other offences committed by the accused. The rule does not apply to any other witnesses in the hearing. Types of release If the court is satisfied that the accused should be released, there are a number of options available: an undertaking, a recognizance with or without sureties, or recognizance with a deposit. The court can impose additional conditions on each of these types of release. Failure to comply with the conditions of release can result in an arrest warrant being issued, or additional charges for failure to appear or failure to comply with conditions. Undertaking A basic undertaking only requires the accused to appear in court as directed by the undertaking. Recognizance without sureties and without deposit A recognizance requires an accused to attend court as directed by the recognizance. The recognizance can be for any amount the court determines would be appropriate based on all of the circumstances (the accused's financial situation, the circumstances of the offence, the likelihood of the recognizance not being complied with, and similar factors). If the accused does not comply with the recognizance, a judge can order the amount of the recognizance to be forfeited to the Crown.Criminal Code, s. 771. Recognizance with sureties and without deposit The court may require that sureties (persons similar to co-signers on a loan) be added to the recognizance. The court has the ability to name specific individuals as sureties. Sureties can apply to the court to be relieved of their obligations. This will usually result in the accused being arrested and held for a new release hearing.Criminal Code, s. 766. Recognizance with deposit and without sureties Another option is release on recognizance with deposit of money or valuable securities by the accused, but without sureties. This option requires the consent of the prosecutor. Recognizance if not ordinary resident If the accused is not an ordinary resident of the province where they are in custody, or they do not ordinarily reside within 200 kilometres of the place where they are in custody, the court can require that they deposit a sum of money or valuable security. Sureties are an option in this situation. No bail bondsmen or insurance There is no commercial business of bail bondsman or bail insurance in Canada. Standing surety for a fee is a criminal offence, as is agreeing to indemnify a surety. Both are considered obstruction of justice.Criminal Code, s. 139(1). Conditions of release The court can impose conditions on release, requiring the accused to comply with one or more of the following conditions: *report at a certain time to the police, *remain within the territorial jurisdiction, *notify the police of any change of address, employment, or occupation, *abstain from communicating, directly or indirectly with certain individuals, *refrain from attending certain locations, *deposit their passport, *comply with any other condition the court considers necessary to ensure the safety of any victim or witness, and *comply with any other reasonable condition the court considers desirable. If the accused is charged with one of the following offences, the court is required to prohibit the accused from possessing any firearm, crossbow, restricted weapon, or prohibited weapon, unless the court considers that such an order is not required: *an offence with the commission of violence, attempted violence, or the threat of violence, *a terrorism offence, *criminal harassment, *intimidation of a justice system participant (victim, witness, etc.), *certain offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, *an offence that involves a firearm, crossbow, restricted weapon, or prohibited weapon, or *certain offences under the Security of Information Act. If the accused is charged with one of the following offences, the court is required to consider whether conditions are necessary to protect the victim or witnesses of the offence: *a terrorism offence, *criminal harassment, *intimidation of justice system participant, *an offence with the commission of violence, attempted violence, or the threat of violence, or *certain offences under the Security of Information Act. Publication bans Either party can request a publication ban on all evidence and reasons given in a release hearing until the charges are resolved. If the publication ban is requested by the defence it is automatic.Criminal Code, s. 517. The provision for a mandatory publication ban has been challenged as infringing the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression, but the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the provision, on the basis that its purpose was to protect the accused's right to a fair trial, which is also a constitutional guarantee.Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada, 2010 SCC 21, [2010 1 SCR 721.] Revocation of release If a police officer has reasonable grounds that an accused has or is about to contravene any type of release, the officer can arrest the individual, who must be brought before a justice for a hearing. If the prosecutor proves a contravention of the conditions, the justice must revoke the original release order. If the justice revokes the release order, a new hearing is held and the accused bears the onus on to show cause why detention is not necessary. Any type of release can also be revoked by the trial judge on application by the Crown or, in limited circumstances, on the court's own motion. The accused is then arrested and faces a hearing for judicial interim release as though the accused has just been arrested for the original offence.Criminal Code, s. 523. Variation A recognizance or undertaking can be varied at any time with the written consent of the prosecutor.Criminal Code, s. 515.1. An order for release or detention can be vacated and replaced without a review or appeal being required in the following situations: *by the trial judge, *by the preliminary inquiry judge (except when the accused is charged with murder or other serious offences within the exclusive jurisdiction of the superior trial court), or *with the consent of the defence and prosecution. Review of order Application for review When a justice or court makes an order for the release or detention of the accused, or varies such an order, either party can bring an application to a superior trial court judge to review the order, and if necessary vacate and replace it. Once a decision is made, both parties must wait 30 days before being allowed to make another application.Criminal Code, s. 520.Criminal Code, s. 521. Automatic review If an accused is ordered detained (either at a bail hearing or after a bail review application), an automatic bail review is made by a superior court judge after a prescribed period of time. For summary conviction offence, the period is 30 days from the date the detention order was made. For indictable offences, the period is 90 days from the date the detention order was made. Besides being able to vacate and replace the order, the judge can also make directions to expedite the accused's trial.Criminal Code, s. 525. Murder and other serious offences The system is different for individuals charged with one of the following offences: * murder, * treason, * intimidating Parliament or a legislature, * inciting to mutiny, * seditious offences, * piracy or piratical acts. These offences are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the superior trial courts,Criminal Code, s. 469. and therefore the applications for judicial interim release are decided by those courts. When a person is charged with one of these offences, the police officer must bring the person before a justice of the peace, under the same time limits as any other arrested person. However, instead of conducting a hearing, the justice of the peace is required to issue a warrant of committal, to last until the person is dealt with according to law.Criminal Code, s. 515(11). If the accused seeks release, they must apply to a judge of the superior trial court for a release hearing. Notably, the onus of proof is on the accused to show cause why they should be released. In other respects, the same rules for release apply.Criminal Code, s. 522. Any review of an order made by the superior court trial judge is heard by the provincial Court of Appeal.Code, s. 680. Young persons charged with offences The Youth Criminal Justice Act governs criminal proceedings for young persons under the age of 18 who are charged with criminal offences under the Criminal Code. The Code provisions respecting release hearings generally apply for young persons,Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, s. 28. with some exceptions or special rules which take into account the age and capacity of the young person. Youth courts are prohibited from detaining youth prior to sentencing as a substitute for appropriate child protection, mental health, or other social measures.Youth Criminal Justice Act, s. 29. The Crown bears the onus of proof for detention. The conditions which the Crown must satisfy are somewhat stricter than is the case for an adult. For example, detention can only be ordered if the young person is charged with a serious offence, or faces outstanding charges. If the youth court concludes the young person should be detained, the youth court can order that the young person be detained in a place of temporary custody, designated for young persons.Youth Criminal Justice Act, s. 30. Alternatively, the youth court can inquire whether there is a responsible person who can exercise control over the young person, and that the young person is willing to be placed in that person's care. If so, both the responsible person and the young person enter into an undertaking with conditions.Youth Criminal Justice Act, s. 31. It is a criminal offence for the young person to not comply with the undertaking. Unlike a surety, the responsible person faces no financial penalty. Instead, the responsible person also faces a criminal offence if they wilfully fail to comply with the undertaking.Youth Criminal Justice Act, s. 139.

History  The first Hospital in Bend named St. Charles was built in 1922 on \\"Hospital Hill\\" located in downtown Bend. The building was named in honor of Bishop Charles Joseph O'Reilly, the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baker. This building was to replace a house at 930 Broadway that the Sisters of St. Joseph of Tipton, Indiana were using for medical facilities. In 1951 a more modern facility was built on the Hospital Hill site. In 1972 the Sisters of St. Joseph transferred the assets of the hospital to a new not for profit corporation called St. Charles Memorial Hospital Inc. On October 12, 1975 the new St. Charles Medical Center was dedicated. In March 1977 the old St. Charles Memorial Hospital building was demolished. on January 1, 2001 Central Oregon District Hospital and St. Charles Medical Center merged to create Cascade Healthcare Services, later renamed to Cascade Healthcare Community, Inc.

As part of the announcement both the Church and CHC said \\"very little will change at St. Charles Bend as a result of this decision. However, Catholic Mass will no longer be celebrated in the hospital's chapel, and all items considered Catholic will be removed from the hospital and returned to the church.\\" The dissolution of the Church's sponsorship ended a 92-year relationship.

Born and raised in Ukraine, he is currently residing in New York City. Career Kryklyvyy and Joanna Leunis were amateur world champions in International Latin. In 2000 the couple took first place in the IDSF World Amateur Latin Championship, the British Open (Blackpool), the ARD Masters Gala (Germany), and the IDSF European Latin Championship.Kryklyvyy/Leunis couple profile at dancesportinfo Kryklyvyy and Leunis were the first World Amateur Latin Champions in the new millennium. After becoming a professional dancer, his longest and most successful partnership was with Karina Smirnoff with whom he became the second best couple in the world, behind the nine-time WDC world champions Bryan Watson and Carmen Vincelj. Kryklyvyy and Smirnoff split up in 2005.Kryklyvyy profile at dancesportinfo Kryklyvyy and then partner Smirnoff were featured in the film Shall We Dance?. Kryklyvyy was credited as the current Blackpool partner of Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) and as dance instructor. Following the partnership with Smirnoff, he paired with Elena Khvorova. They won second place in the 2006 and 2007 World Championships, however, their results were not as good as Kryklyvyy's previous placements with Smirnoff; his former partner, Joanna Leunis started to beat them with her partner, Michael Malitowski. This probably led to the couple's split. He next had a short-lived partnership with Hanna Karttunen who was already retired after her successful career with Paul Killick. They were second behind Watson and Vincelj and in front of Kryklyvyy and Smirnoff until their retirement. In 2008 Karttunen confirmed that she will be back on the floor with Kryklyvyy but the UK Open Championship in 2009 was a huge disappointment for both of them. The couple finished 6th while the winners were Malitowski and Leunis. In 2009-2010, Slavik Kryklyvyy partnered with Anna Melnikova, then amateur Latin champion, representing Russia in the international arena. Kryklyvyy and Melnikova were guest competitors as Show Performers.Video of Slavik Kryklyvyy at 2dance.tv The couple were the subject of a feature documentary \\"Ballroom Dancer\\", directed by Christian Holten Bonke and Andreas Koefoed. It was probably Kryklyvyy's last chance to reach the top but he and Melnikova could not manage the challenge.

UCC Insurance is utilized for transactions described in Article 9, \\"Secured Transactions\\", of the Uniform Commercial Code,\\"UCC\\". All of the larger land-title insurance companies now offer various versions of UCC insurance. The policies contain significant differences, but tend to serve the same purpose. Coverage Personal property is generally anything that is not real property. This coverage includes movable collateral, such as equipment or inventory; intellectual property, including patents and trademarks and copyrightable matters (but not copyrighted matters which are excluded from the UCC); software and software embedded in goods; general intangibles like contract rights; payment intangibles; and investment property like common stock. Also covered is personal property that has become so affixed to the real property that an interest in real property arises under real property law.Prendergast, James: \\"Utility of UCC Insurance\\", page 96. The Secured Lender, November/December 2003 Volume 59 Number 6. In addition to the basic lien-priority coverage, UCC insurance covers many of the risks associated with the perfection of a security interest through the central filing system, such as the authorized execution of the lien-granting document by the debtor, misindexed filings, unauthorized termination statements filed against the record, the correctness of the debtor name, filing in the appropriate jurisdictions, and similar matters. Additionally, the coverage insures the gap between the search report and the date of filing. Policy variety While various companies use specific brand names, the two main types of policies are the Lender's Policy and the Buyer's Policy. A Lender's Policy will insure attachment, perfection and priority of a secured party's lien. A Buyer's Policy will insure that personal property items are purchased \\"free and clear\\" of lien. Specific policies should be thoroughly examined as there is a lack of uniformity in the marketplace.

The manga started serialization in the Japanese sh≈çnen manga magazine Comic Blade on July 30, 2008, published by Mag Garden. It is ongoing, with six volumes to date. English-language distribution was being handled by Tokyopop; however, they were only able to publish the first volume before closing in May 2011 due to bankruptcy. Plot Takenomaru Sagami is a violinist prodigy with a contract to fulfill. When he was 11 years old, Takenomaru contracted smallpox and became critically ill. Constantly feeling unwanted and hated throughout his life, he looked towards death as an escape. In his weak condition, he discovered hope in life from world-famous violinist and soldier Lieutenant Sagami, who encouraged him to learn the violin once he recovered from his illness. He told him music had nothing to do with race, which Takenomaru was used to seeing criticism for because of his foreign blood. Not long after finding his hope and purpose, Takenomaru stood before the entrance of death and made a contract with \\"an angel\\" in order to continue living. In exchange for being allowed to live and two other certain gifts he must sacrifice others by collecting the twelve Tears of Maria. Out of his resentment for the world, he agrees readily. Seven years later, at the music school where his foster father (Sagami) teaches, he pursues twelve girls to attain the jewels that represent each girl's feelings for him. He gives them each a brooch that changes color by the intensity feelings they have for him. Once they fall in love with him, the girls must face their death in order for Takenomaru to collect the Tear of Maria hidden in the girls‚Äô hearts. Characters Takenomaru Sagami: Eighteen years old, and adopted by Mr. Sagami. He's also a master of the violin (a \\"prodigy\\") and is quite good looking. When he was younger he was bullied and mistreated because of his \\"white man's blood\\" by the town's children and adults, even by the old man who took him in after his father and then mother abandoned him. When he was at the verge of dying he made a pact with an \\"angel\\" and gained his lifeforce back, as well as two gifts, those of musical talent and good looks (the latter ridding him of potential pockmarks from his deadly case of smallpox); but as part of the contract he must attain the twelve Tears of Maria.He resembles Kazune and Suzune Kujyou from Kamichama Karin. Mr. Sagami: Adoptive father of Takenomaru, he is skeptical of his activities. His relationship with Takenomaru is complicated. He lost his left hand in the war, and his wife also died, so he holds high expectation of \\"Take\\" (as he calls Takenomaru) to become a great violinist and make him proud. Nakae Wakabayashi: Childhood friend of Takenomaru who protected him and was his only companion. She came from their hometown to live and work in the city. She ends up working at Takenomaru's and Mr. Sagami's house as a maid. Even after seven years, when they reconnect, Nakae still calls Takenomaru by the childish nickname \\"Take-chan\\" and acts as if she was his older sister. Her overprotectiveness of Takenomaru is similar to Pita Ten's Koboshi Uematsu's towards protagonist Kotarou Higuchi. Nanao Kaga: A naive girl who, against her father's wishes and future arranged marriage, joins the music school in pursuit of Takenomaru, whom she once heard playing the violin and ended up moved by his performance. In the beginning, she calls him \\"Takenomaru-sama,\\" but changes it to \\"Takenomaru-san\\" after she finds out he is younger than her (putting her anywhere between 19 and 21 years of age). She is the first to fall in love with him and is then stabbed by Takenomaru in a church building so that he may gather the first Tear of Maria from her. She resembles Karin Hanazono/Suzuka Kujyo from Kamichama Karin. Misaki Kanda: A young girl who resembles Misha from Koge Donbo's previous work Pita Ten. She became friends with Nanao after they met and thinks of her even after her death, although she and a few others assume it is either a \\"disappearance\\" or a transference. Rumoi Matsumae: A young girl who is blind in one eye and extremely smart, considered a genius. Because of her intelligence, she is allowed to be at the school as an exception for someone of her young age. She carries a pink bunny doll. Chigusa Nakamura: A quiet, mysterious and mature student who likes archery. She seems to know something about what is going on with Takenomaru and the Tears of Maria. Hikari Hagi: This spunky girl holds great admiration for Takenomaru. In volume 3, she and Takenomaru go on a date which eventually leads to them sleeping together. Then, the day after they get in a fight and Hikari commits suicide. She looks similar to Rabi~En~Rose from Di Gi Charat. Mine Shimabara: Twin sister of Miwa and her polar opposite, she dislikes the idea of having a male student in the all-girls music school. She becomes Takenomaru's 2nd Maria and victim, suffering the same fate as Nanao. Miwa Shimabara: A nun who is gentle, quiet and sweet. Kami Muroto: A girl with twin tails who wields a sword. She attacks Takenomaru for no apparent reason and gravely injures him. Maiko C. Suma: She is Takenomaru's younger sister, whom he hasn't seen in a long time. They have the same hair color, but her eyes are green while his are red. Later in the chapters, she also receives a brooch from Takenomaru. The \\"C\\" stands for \\"Catherine.\\" Asahi Nanba: A beautiful looking girl wearing a white kimono. Her expression appears emotionless, revealing that she is not human but rather a singing doll. Later in the chapters she also receives a brooch. Ukyo Sagano: Is a young girl with black hair and red eyes who wears a miko attire, she seems to be cheerful and naive. She looks like Himeka Kujyo and Himeka/Rika Karasuma from Kamichama Karin. The Angel: He/She has not make a corporeal appearance yet. He/She was the one who made a pact with Takenomaru and granted him the two gifts in exchange for the twelve Tears of Maria.  Reception  Snow Wildsmith, writing for ICv2, a pop culture trade news site, gave the first volume 1 out of 5 stars. Her chief complaint was the jarring discrepancy between the dark story and the cute style of both the art and dialogue.

He served as Bishop of Columbus from 1880 until his death in 1899. Biography The sixth of eleven children, John Watterson was born in Blairsville, Pennsylvania, to John Sylvester and Sarah Salome (n√©e McAfee) Watterson. His father's family came to the United States from the Isle of Mann in 1762; originally Episcopalians, his grandfather was orphaned in 1781 and subsequently raised by a Catholic family in York County, Pennsylvania. His mother's family was from County Armagh, Ireland, and settled in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. John's parents frequently offered their home as a place of rest to traveling missionaries, and their house even became known as \\"The Priest's Hotel.\\" After attending the parochial school of Sts. Simon and Jude Church in Blairsville, Watterson was sent to St. Vincent's College in Latrobe at a young age. In 1861 he entered Mount St. Mary's Seminary at Emmitsburg, Maryland, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with high honors. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Michael Domenec, C.M., on August 9, 1868, at St. Vincent's Abbey. Watterson then served as professor of moral theology and Scripture at Mount St. Mary's, where he became vice president in 1877 and later president in 1879. He earned a Doctor of Divinity degree from Georgetown College at Washington, D.C. in June 1879. On March 14, 1880, Watterson was appointed the second Bishop of Columbus by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 8 from Archbishop William Henry Elder, with Bishops William George McCloskey and John Tuigg serving as co-consecrators. During his 19-year-long tenure, Watterson increased the number of priests and schools in the diocese, founded two hospitals and the Pontifical College Josephinum, and erected many new missions and parishes. A strong proponent of temperance, he prohibited saloon owners from holding office in any Catholic organization in the diocese, and made all the children to whom he administered Confirmation promise not to drink until they were 21. He was the first Catholic bishop ever to speak at Ohio State University. Watterson died unexpectedly at age 54. He is buried at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Columbus. Bishop Watterson High School is named in his honor.

It was established in 1969 as the \\"Village Blues Club\\", and from then until 1975 it was considered east London's premier rock music venue. In 2007, filmmakers Ken Gascoigne and \\"H\\" Curran produced a documentary about the club in which they interviewed some of the artists who appeared there in its heyday, including Mick Box of Uriah Heep, Brian May of Queen, the Roundhouse Promoter Andy Townsend, and various local residents, who recalled memories of the club. Behind the pub, in the location of the old car park, is a road called Bragg Close. This is named after the singer and poet Billy Bragg, whose family has lived in the area for over a century. Bragg opened the street on 24 August 1999, dedicating it to his own brother, and paying tribute to Ben Tillett, the founder of the dockworkers union. It consists of 12 housing association homes. Location Side view It is located in the triangular segment formed by the junction of Porters Avenue (the A1153) and Lodge Avenue, and is adjacent to a boating lake and Mayesbrook park, the home of Barking & East Ham United F.C. The main circular building is approximately in diameter, but the function room, which was used for concerts and bingo, is a long, low ceilinged, rectangular wing, extending along Lodge Avenue. It lies roughly halfway between Upney and Becontree stations on the District line in zone 5. The Roundhouse is a stop on London Buses route 368. Acts Acts that have appeared there include Led Zeppelin, Genesis, Thin Lizzy, Rory Gallagher, Pink Floyd Killing Floor performing at the Roundhouse, 1971 Handbill from 1975 Reunion A Facebook nostalgia group was started for the Village Blues Club in 2008. It now has some 100+ members, and a private reunion was held in May 2012, back in the Roundhouse where it all started. The band who played there the most in its heyday, a total of 13 times, Stray, headlined the gig. A second reunion was held in May 2013, headlined by The Big Blues Jam (Jon Amor/Pete Gage/Mark Barrett/Dave Doherty & Friends), with support by Jon Amor. (Reunion II). A third reunion was held in September 2013, with The Pink Torpedoes (Pete Gage/Paul Hartshorn/Pete Lowrey/Dave Raeburn). (Reunion III). The fourth reunion took place in May 2014, once again starring Stray (Reunion IV). Reunion V was in September 2014, again providing a link back to the original Roundhouse in that it starred Son of Man, which included George Jones, son of the original Man's Micky Jones, on guitar. Reunion VI in May 2015 starred Martin Turner, playing the music of Wishbone Ash. Public house The Campaign For Real Ale (Camra) has included The Roundhouse in its database of heritage pubs in recognition of its historic interior.

The ecclesiastical province of Nisibis (Syriac: Nisibin, , often abbreviated to Soba, ) had a number of suffragan dioceses at different periods in its history, including Arzun, Beth Rahima√Ø, Beth Qardu (later renamed Tamanon), Beth Zabda√Ø, Qube d‚ÄôArzun, Balad, Shigar (Sinjar), Armenia, Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye, Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), Maiperqat (with Amid and Mardin), Resha√Øna, Qarta and Adarma, Qaimar and Hesna d'Kifa. Aoustan d'Arzun and Beth Moksaye were also suffragan dioceses in the fifth century.  Background  In 363 the Roman emperor Jovian was obliged to cede Nisibis and five neighbouring districts to Persia to extricate the defeated army of his predecessor Julian from Persian territory. The Nisibis region, after nearly fifty years of rule by Constantine and his Christian successors, may well have contained more Christians than the entire Sassanian empire, and this Christian population was absorbed into the Church of the East in a single generation. The impact of the cession of Nisibis on the demography of the Church of the East was so marked that the province of Nisibis was ranked second among the five metropolitan provinces established at the synod of Isaac in 410, a precedence apparently conceded without dispute by the bishops of the three older Persian provinces relegated to a lower rank. The metropolitan of Nisibis ranked below the metropolitan of Ilam, but above the metropolitans of Maishan, Adiabene and Beth Garma√Ø.Chabot, 272‚Äì3 The bishop of Nisibis was recognised in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac as 'metropolitan of Arzun, of Qardu, of Beth Zabda√Ø, of Beth Rahima√Ø, of Beth Moksaye, and of the bishops to be found there', and the bishops Daniel of Arzun, Samuel 'of Arzun for Baita d'Aoustan', Daniel of Beth Moksaye, and Abraham of Beth Rahima√Ø were confirmed as his suffragans.Chabot, 272‚Äì3  Ecclesiastical history  Nisibis was a frontier town between the Roman and Persian empires The bishop of Nisibis was recognised in 410 as the metropolitan of Arzun (), Qardu (), Beth Zabda√Ø (), Beth Rahima√Ø () and Beth Moksaye (). These were the Syriac names for Arzanene, Corduene, Zabdicene, Rehimene and Moxoene, the five districts ceded by Rome to Persia in 363. The metropolitan diocese of Nisibis () and the suffragan dioceses of Arzun, Qardu and Beth Zabda√Ø were to enjoy a long history, but Beth Rahima√Ø is not mentioned again, while Beth Moksaye is not mentioned after 424, when its bishop Atticus (probably, from his name, a Roman) subscribed to the acts of the synod of Dadisho. Besides the bishop of Arzun, a bishop of 'Aoustan d‚ÄôArzun' (plausibly identified with the district of Ingilene) also attended these two synods, and his diocese was also assigned to the province of Nisibis. The diocese of Aoustan d'Arzun survived into the sixth century, but is not mentioned after 554. During the fifth and sixth centuries three new dioceses in the province of Nisibis were founded in Persian territory, in Beth Arabaye (the hinterland of Nisibis, between Mosul and the Tigris and Khabur rivers) and in the hill country to the northeast of Arzun. By 497 a diocese had been established at Balad (the modern Eski Mosul) on the Tigris, which persisted into the fourteenth century.Fiey, POCN, 57‚Äì8 By 563 there was also a diocese for Shigar (Sinjar), deep inside Beth Arabaye, and by 585 a diocese for 'Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye', the country to the west of Lake Van inhabited by the Kartaw Kurds.Fiey, POCN, 134 The famous School of Nisibis was an important seminary and theological academy of the Church of the East during the late Sassanian period, and in the last two centuries of Sassanian rule generated a remarkable outpouring of East Syriac theological scholarship. Probably during the Umayyad period, the East Syriac diocese of Armenia was attached to the province of Nisibis. The bishop Artashahr of Armenia was present at the synod of Dadisho in 424, but the diocese was not assigned to a metropolitan province. In the late thirteenth century Armenia was certainly a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis, and its dependency probably went back to the seventh or eighth century. The bishops of Armenia appear to have sat at the town of Halat (Ahlat) on the northern shore of Lake Van. The Arab conquest allowed the East Syriacs to move into western Mesopotamia and establish communities in Damascus and other towns that had formerly been in Roman territory, where they lived alongside much larger Syriac Orthodox, Armenian and Melkite communities. Some of these western communities were placed under the jurisdiction of the East Syriac metropolitans of Damascus, but others were attached to the province of Nisibis. The latter included a diocese for Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), first attested in the eighth century and last mentioned towards the end of the eleventh century, and a diocese at Maiperqat, first mentioned at the end of the eleventh century, whose bishops were also responsible for the East Syrian communities in Amid and Mardin.Fiey, POCN, 49‚Äì50 and 88 Eleventh- and thirteenth-century lists of dioceses in the province of Nisibis also mention a diocese for the Syrian town of Resha√Øna (Ras al-Ain). Resha√Øna is a plausible location for an East Syriac diocese at this period, but none of its bishops are known.Fiey, POCN, 124 Changes in the formal and informal titles borne by the metropolitans of Nisibis reflect the shifts in the province's centre of gravity over the centuries. In 497 the metropolitan Hosea of Nisibis was styled 'metropolitan of the country of Beth Arabaye'.Chabot, 315 In the eleventh century the metropolitan Abdisho Ibn Arid of Nisibis, who became patriarch in 1074, was styled 'metropolitan bishop of Soba [Nisibis] and Beth Nahrin [Mesopotamia]'.Mari, 129 (Arabic) At the end of the thirteenth century the celebrated East Syriac writer Abdisho Bar Brikha, himself metropolitan of Nisibis, referred loosely to his province as 'Soba (Nisibis) and Mediterranean Syria'.Chabot, 619‚Äì20 Few Mesopotamian or Syrian dioceses still existed at this period, however, and Abdisho was normally styled 'metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia'. As far as is known, the title 'metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia' was used by all of Abdisho's successors until 1610, when the East Syriac metropolitan province of Nisibis was abolished. Abdisho Bar Brikha listed thirteen suffragan dioceses in the province of Nisibis at the end of the thirteenth century, in the following order: Arzun, Qube, Beth Rahima√Ø, Balad, Shigar, Qardu, Tamanon, Beth Zabda√Ø, Halat, Harran, Amid, Resha√Øna and 'Adormiah' (Qarta and Adarma).Chabot, 619‚Äì20 It has been convincingly argued that Abdisho was giving a conspectus of dioceses in the province of Nisibis at various periods in its history rather than an authentic list of late- thirteenth century dioceses, and it is unlikely that the dioceses of Qube, Beth Rahima√Ø, Harran and Resha√Øna still existed at this period. A diocese was founded around the middle of the thirteenth century to the north of the Tur Abdin for the town of Hesna d'Kifa, perhaps in response to East Syriac immigration to the towns of the Tigris plain during the Mongol period. At the same time, a number of older dioceses may have ceased to exist. The dioceses of Qaimar and Qarta and Adarma are last mentioned towards the end of the twelfth century, and the diocese of Tamanon in 1265, and it is not clear whether they persisted into the fourteenth century. The only dioceses in the province of Nisibis definitely in existence at the end of the thirteenth century were Armenia (whose bishops sat at Halat on the northern shore of Lake Van), Shigar, Balad, Arzun and Maiperqat.

Wallis Budge), ii. 447 The bishop Yohannan of Balad was appointed metropolitan of Merv by the patriarch Sargis (860‚Äì72).Sliba, 73 (Arabic) The bishop Eliya of Balad was appointed metropolitan of Bardaa by the patriarch Mari (987‚Äì99).Sliba, 95 (Arabic) The bishop Sabrisho of Balad was present at the consecration of the patriarch Abdisho II (1074‚Äì90), and was later consecrated metropolitan of Ilam by the same patriarch.Mari, 130 (Arabic), 114‚Äì15 (Latin) An unnamed bishop of Balad was present at the consecration of the patriarch Bar Sawma in 1134.Mari, 154 (Arabic), 131 (Latin) The bishop Shemon 'of Balad and al-Jaslona (Gaslona)' was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yahballaha III in 1281.Sliba, 124 (Arabic) The bishop Shemon of Balad was present at the consecration of the patriarch Timothy II in 1318.Assemani, BO, iii. i. 567‚Äì80 Diocese of Shigar  The Diocese of Shigar was founded in the sixth century, probably to counter the growing influence of the Jacobites in the Sinjar region. The full name of the diocese was Shigar and Beth Arabaye, and it covered the desert region to the north of Sinjar, where there were several Nestorian monasteries. Six Nestorian bishops of Shigar are attested between the sixth and the fourteenth centuries. The first of these bishops, Bawai, is mentioned in 563. The last, Yohannan, was present at the consecration of the patriarch Timothy II in 1318.Fiey, POCN, 134 It is not clear when the diocese of Shigar came to an end. The Shigar region seems to have had a small Nestorian community up to the seventeenth century, and may even have had a bishop from time to time. A metropolitan 'Glanan Imech' (possibly Maranemmeh), of 'Sciugar' is mentioned in the report of 1607, and may have been a bishop of Shigar. According to a Yazidi tradition, the last Nestorian 'metropolitan' of Sinjar died around 1660, and the region's few remaining Nestorian Christians become Yazidis. It is difficult to say whether there is any truth in this tradition.Guest, Yezidis, 52  Diocese of Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye  The bishop Klilisho of 'Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye' was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585.Chabot, 423  Diocese of Qarta and Adarma  The diocese of Qarta and Adarma was listed as a suffragan diocese in the province of Nisibis in the Mukhtasar of 1007/8, and a bishop Mushe of Qarta and Adarma is attested during the reign of the catholicus Eliya II (1111‚Äì32). A ritual for the consecration of the bishop of Qarta and Adarma has survived in the works of the patriarch Eliya III (1176‚Äì90). Finally, a manuscript was copied in 1186 in the monastery of Mar Awgin near Nisibis for the village of Tel Mahmad 'in the diocese of Qarta'. Its colophon mentions that the manuscript was copied in the time of the patriarch Eliya III and the metropolitan Yahballaha of Nisibis, providing further confirmation that Qarta was a diocese in the province of Nisibis.MS Mosul (Scher) 12 Qarta has been identified by Fiey with the monastery of Mar Gabrona and Mar Shmona (Arabic: Dayr al-Qara) near the Lailah Dagh, twenty kilometres to the southeast of Gazarta, and Adarma with the small town of Adarma, seventy kilometres east of Nisibis, near the modern Tel Rmelan al- Kabir. The seat of the bishops of Qarta and Adarma may have been the monastery of Gabrona and Shmona, mentioned in the colophons of manuscripts of 1213/4 and 1217/8.Fiey, Nisibe, 251‚Äì2; POCN, 120‚Äì1 Diocese of Armenia The Nestorian diocese of Armenia, whose bishops sat in the town of Halat (Ahlat) on the northern shore of Lake Van, is attested between the fifth and fourteenth centuries. In the fifth century the diocese of Halat was not assigned to a metropolitan province, but was later included in the province of Nisibis, probably shortly after the Arab conquest. The patriarch Timothy I created a metropolitan province for Armenia, presumably by raising the status of the diocese of Halat. By the second half of the eleventh century Halat was once again a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis. By the thirteenth century the jurisdiction of the bishops of Halat included the towns of Van and Wastan.Fiey, POCN, 47‚Äì8, 53 and 58‚Äì9  The diocese of Qaimar  An unnamed bishop of Qaimar was present at the consecration of the patriarch Bar Sawma in 1134.Mari, 154 (Arabic), 131 (Latin) The bishop Sabrisho of Qaimar was transferred to the diocese of Kashkar by the patriarch Eliya III (1176‚Äì90).Sliba, 111 (Arabic)  Diocese of Hesna d'Kifa  A diocese was founded around the middle of the thirteenth century to the north of the Tur Abdin for the town of Hesna d'Kifa. The bishop Eliya of Hesna d'Kifa was present at the enthronement of Makkikha II in 1257.Sliba, 120 (Arabic) The bishop Emmanuel of Hesna d‚ÄôKifa was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yahballaha III in 1281.Sliba, 124 (Arabic)  Unspecified sees  The unperfected bishop Ibn Fadala, 'guardian of the throne of Nisibis' and bishop of an unnamed diocese in the province of Nisibis, was present together with the metropolitan Yohannan of Nisibis at the consecration of the patriarch Abdisho III in 1139. He was required to proclaim the patriarch's name in the traditional ceremony in the church of Mar Pethion, 'because all the bishops of the great eparchy [Beth Aramaye] had died, and their thrones were vacant; something which had never happened before'.Mari, 157 (Arabic), 133 (Latin) References Citations Bibliography  Assemani, J.

The festival includes visual arts, performing arts, music and theory of culture. The first Akto festival was held in 2006. The aim of the festival is to open the cultural frameworks of a modern society through \\"recomposing\\" and redefining them in a new context. In the past, the festival featured artists from regional countries like Slovenia, Greece or Bulgaria, but also from Germany, Italy, France and Austria. The Association for culture and art FRU ‚Äì Faculty of things that can't be learned works as a project platform in the area of contemporary art and culture, focused on event production whose purpose is to create critical engagement and active participation of citizens in the creation of the public socio-political discourse inside the community. One of FRU's main activities is the annual AKTO Festival for contemporary art (started in Bitola, 2006), that has imposed itself as a serious part in promoting and producing new forms of influence on the civil consciousness, locally and regionally. AKTO Festival has been cooperating with several regional organizations in partnership projects, executing 9 editions so far, with the participation of about 300 artists, presented via numerous exhibitions, conferences, different kinds of events, etc. such as festivals Perforacije (Zagreb), Culturescapes (Bazel) and the regional networks BCC / balcan can contemporary and Urban Hum and the regional projects Listening to the Audience, LIVING LIBRARIES: archives of civil disobedience, If Buildings Could Talks etc. Artistic director and president of FRU is Filip Jovanovski (artist, activist, and curator), and Ivana Vaseva (curator, and program coordinator of FRU). Pop UP AKTO is the new edition of AKTO Festival for contemporary arts ‚Äì the last 10 years it was happening in August in Bitola (2006‚Äì2015) ‚Äì transformed, renewed and reshaped. It stars its new journey not as an annual festival with 3 ‚Äì day condensed program but as a series of mini curated festivals or festive events that pop up in different cities in North Macedonia, starting from Stip, Skopje, Tetovo and Bitola. Thematically, Pop UP AKTO is exploring the city environment and dwelling, its places of memory and the new adjectives attached to them as part of the city's transformation. It talks about the positive aspect of being in the city ‚Äì on one's own or being together and aims at promoting places of democratic expression on freedom and inclusion of citizens from experts to amateurs. The new cycle of AKTO Festival forms itself from the rethinking of its position as a festival that contributes towards the change of the current cultural and public policy, budget-wise, production-wise and distribution-wise. The idea of this program of events in 3 cities stems to empower the local community to feel the cultural production in the country, share the experience and motivate to continue the ideas beyond this organizational structure. It intends to make a network of citizens which will have two main missions: 1\\\\. INSIDE to empower the local communities in each local context (the mayor being ‚Äúfather figure‚Äù having the total control in the city leaving unsatisfied citizens and young people immigrating) 2\\\\. OUTSIDE network of people and organizations that will share knowledge, experience and programs References Category:Arts festivals in North Macedonia Category:Tourist attractions in Bitola Category:Summer events in North Macedonia ","title":"Akto Festival"},{"id":"24024541","text":"William Johnson (March 22, 1916 - March 6, 1957) was an American actor and singer of the stage and screen.Obituary Variety, March 13, 1957, page 63.

He returned to Broadway in 1926 to portray the Hangman in Rudolf Friml's The Vagabond King. He worked as a vaudeville performer up through the early 1930s. In 1939 he made his film debut in Mr. & Mrs. Jesse Crawford at Home where he sang the songs \\"The Very Thought of You\\" and \\"I Love You Truly\\". He only appeared in two more films during his career, the roles of Captain Bill Barclay in Keep Your Powder Dry and Buzz Fletcher in It's a Pleasure, both in 1945. He studied engineering at the University of Maryland. In 1940 Johnson returned to Broadway after a fourteen-year absence to star in the musical review All in Fun. He was a regular performer on Broadway during the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such roles as Charlie in Banjo Eyes, Sherman in Yours, A. Lincoln, Staff Sgt. Rocky Fulton in Something for the Boys, Alex Maitland in The Day Before Spring, and Hajj in Kismet among others. He starred opposite Ethel Merman in 1944, in Something for the Boys.

It has an anti-lock brake (ABS) option. Heavily based on its 250cc predecessor, the XRE300 is aimed at urban riders but can be used for light trail work. The XRE300 is used by motorized infantry brigades of the Brazilian army. In 2018 the Policia Nacional in Colombia acquire this model for their police officers, Cali, Bogota, Medellin started with it and moreover all country. The bike has becoming in an excellent choice for those adventures who want to travel on / off-road routes moreover trusting in the recognition, reliability and goodwill done Honda Motor Company by across the years in LATAM. Developed as Dual-sport motorcycle the XRE 300 deliver an engine power close to 26 hp @ 7500 rpm offering a cruise speed average between 85 km/h - 90 km/h in the middle range of the tachometer (5000 rpm - 5500 rpm) with no compromise neither the bike durability, fuel consumption or rider comfort. The display shows the top speed of 134 km/h just at the red line of the tachometer (9000 rpm). The bike has a superior Trail off-road capability with an engine torque close to 27 Nm @ 6500 rpm giving excellent performance in the low and middle range of the revs (1500 rpm - 6500 rpm) such response is a goal with either sand, mud or gravel ride conditions. For those dedicated motorbike globetrotters the bike ride over a Metzeler Enduro 3 Sahara tires as standard. With a 50% on-road / 50% off-road this tires doing self-cleaning thanks to its design tread, overall traction in dry and wet roads assuring best brake response even extreme drive conditions.

The effect is also observed when subjects administer punishment rather than reward. Research has shown that individuals can be more likely to mete out punishment, even at their own expense, when they are punishing specific, identifiable individuals (\\"perpetrators\\"). Concrete images and representations are often more powerful sources of persuasion than are abstract statistics. For example, Ryan White contracted HIV at age 13 and struggled with the disease until succumbing some six years later. Following his death, the US congress passed the Ryan White Care Act, which funded the largest set of services for people living with the AIDS in the country. The effect is epitomized by the phrase (commonly attributed to Joseph Stalin) \\"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.\\"  Origin  The conceptualization of the identifiable victim effect as it is known today is commonly attributed to American economist Thomas Schelling. He wrote that harm to a particular person invokes ‚Äúanxiety and sentiment, guilt and awe, responsibility and religion, [but]‚Ä¶most of this awesomeness disappears when we deal with statistical death‚Äù.  Explanations   Ex post vs ex ante evaluation  The decision to save an identifiable victim is made ex post, meaning it is done after the victim is in danger. In contrast, the decision to save a statistical victim is often made ex ante, as a pre-emptive measure to prevent the individual from being in danger. When people consider the risks of not helping a victim, they consider the probability of being responsible and blamed. This probability is much greater with identifiable victims than with statistical victims because one cannot accurately predict the likelihood of a tragedy occurring in the future and thus cannot be held responsible for tragedies that might occur in the future. (Although, Jenni, & Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support the effect of ex post/ex ante on IVE) This explanation is closest to what Thomas Schelling implied in his now-famous paper.  Vividness  Identifiable victims, as their name suggests, have features that make them identifiable. Details about their predicament, family background, educational history, etc., are shared through the media and brought to public attention. The stories are emotional, with victims often portrayed as innocent and helpless. For example, Perrault et al. tested an identifiable human victim message, in relation to an identifiable animal victim (i.e., a squirrel) using the context of the consequences of littering, and found the identifiable animal message - an innocent and helpless creature - elicited greater levels of distress and empathy than the identifiable human message. Images and videos of the victim are often shared, and the public is able to follow the victim's predicament in real-time. Studies have previously indicated that people respond more to concrete, graphic information than abstract, statistical information. The vividness of identifiable victims creates a sense of familiarity and social closeness (opposite of social distance). Therefore, identifiable victims elicit greater reactions from people than statistical victims. (Although, Jenni, & Loewenstein [1997] have found no evidence to support this effect.)  Certainty effect, risk-seeking for losses and loss aversion  The certainty effect and risk seeking for losses reinforce each other. The certainty effect is the inclination to place disproportionately greater weighting to certain outcomes than to uncertain but likely outcomes. The consequences to identifiable victims are viewed as certain to occur whereas the consequences to statistical victims are viewed as probabilistic. Research has also shown the tendency of people to be risk- seeking for losses. A certain loss is viewed more negatively than an uncertain loss with the same expected value. Closely related to this is people tendency to be loss averse. They view saving a statistical life as a gain, whereas saving an identifiable victim is seen as avoiding a loss. Together, these effects result in people being more likely to aid identifiable, certain victims than statistical, uncertain victims.  Response to the relative size of the reference group  Risk that is concentrated is perceived as greater than the same risk dispersed over a wider population. Identifiable victims are their own reference group; if they do not receive aid then the entire reference group is regarded to perish. To illustrate this point, consider an explosion at an offshore oil rig where 50 people work. Suppose all 50 people die in the explosion, this represents 50 of the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs. Yet, the reference group is not the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs but rather the 50 people working on that particular offshore oil rig. Therefore, this is perceived as 50 of 50 people certain to die so by aiding them, a significant proportion of the reference group can be saved. People's response to the proportion of the reference group that can be saved is such a significant contributor to the identifiable victim effect that this effect could be re-labelled as the ‚Äúpercentage of reference group saved effect‚Äù.  Implications and examples   Aiding  One implication of the identifiable victim effect is identifiable victims are more likely to be helped than statistical victims. An incident that frequently features in literature is the aid given to Jessica McClure and her family. On October 14, 1987, 18-month old Jessica McClure fell into a narrow well in her aunt's home day-care centre in Midland, Texas. Within hours, 'Baby Jessica', as she became known, made headlines around the US. The public reacted with sympathy towards her ordeal. While teams of rescue workers, paramedics and volunteers worked to successfully rescue 'Baby Jessica' in 58 hours, a total of $700,000 was amassed in that time. Even after being discharged from hospital, the McClure family were flooded with cards and gifts from members of the public as well as a visit from then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and a telephone call from then-President Ronald Reagan.  Punishment  The identifiable victim effect is suggested to be a specific case of a more general 'identifiable other effect'. As such, it also has an effect on punishments. People prefer to punish identified transgressors rather than unidentified transgressors when given a choice between the two. People also exert more severe punishments on identified than unidentified transgressors. Individuals are also more likely to assign blame to an identified transgressor if they feel they have been wronged. There is also an increased desire for harsh punishments that persists even when self-sacrifice is required in order to punish the transgressor. This effect can possibly be explained by the increased anger felt towards an identified rather than an unidentified transgressor. This supports the theory of ‚Äúvividness‚Äù as a source of the identifiable victim effect (Small & Loewenstein, 2005).  Public policy   Healthcare  The identifiable victim effect may also influence healthcare, both at the individual and national level (Redelmeir & Tversky, 1990). On the individual level, doctors are more likely to recommend expensive, but potentially life-saving, treatments to an individual patient rather than to a group of patients. This effect is not limited to medical professionals, as laymen demonstrate this same bias towards providing more expensive treatments for individual patients (Redelmeir & Tversky, 1990). On the national level, the American people are far more likely to contribute to an expensive treatment to save the life of one person rather than spend much smaller amounts on preventative measures that could save the lives of thousands per year. A function of American individualism, this nationwide bias towards expensive treatments is still prevalent today (Toufexis & Bjerklie, 1993). =Ryan White Care Act = The need to tackle the problems faced by AIDS sufferers was brought to the political forefront as a result of the legal and social plight of one particular AIDS victim, Ryan White. His circumstances and campaign for greater funding for AIDS research were widely publicised in the media which culminated in legislation being passed to provide financial support to AIDS sufferers and their families in 1990 shortly after White's death.  Criminal justice  Since the identifiable victim effect can influence punishment, it has the potential to undermine the system of trial by jury (Small & Loewenstein, 2005). Jurors, when deliberating, work with an identifiable perpetrator, and thus may attach negative emotions (e.g. disgust, anger) to the individual or assign increased blame when handing down a harsh sentence. Policymakers, who are unable to see the individual offender, being almost entirely emotionally removed, may actually have intended a more lenient sentence. This may produce a harsher verdict than the legal guidelines recommend or allow. On the other extreme, jurors may feel sympathy, relating with the perpetrator on a level not experienced by policymakers, leading to a milder verdict than legally appropriate or allowable (Small & Loewenstein, 2005). Typically in crime investigations, law enforcement forces conceal any information regarding the identities of the suspects until they have strong evidence that the suspects are credible. When identities of suspects are revealed through description of their features or release of their images, media coverage and public discussion on the issue grows. On one side, the public discourse can become increasingly negative and hostile, or, if the perpetrator is sympathetic, support for the perpetrator may grow. This is because people experience a greater emotional reaction towards a concrete, identifiable perpetrator than an abstract, unidentifiable one. =Brady Bill = James S. Brady, the then-White House press secretary, was among three collateral damage victims in the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981. Brady was explicitly named in reports of the shooting in contrast to the other two injured, a District of Columbia police officer and a Secret Service agent. The political reaction was largely focused on the injuries of Brady which led to the enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. It states that it is mandatory for firearm dealers to perform background searches on firearm purchasers.  Business ethics  According to a 2016 study by Yam and Reynolds, the growing absence of the identifiable victim effect in the business world may contribute to an increase in unethical business behavior. With an increasingly globalized business framework, the identifiable victim effect may become naturally mediated, freeing business leaders and employees alike to engage in unethical behavior without guilt or emotional distress. This may be possible because globalization results in less face-to-face contact, decreasing the identifiability of possible victims. Research suggests that business leaders, as well as workers, are more likely to engage in unethical behavior when the victims of their behavior are anonymous. At the executive level, one possible result of this is worker commodification and exploitation. At the worker level, employees of a company are possibly more likely to steal from the company or lie on a report if they do not believe this behavior will negatively affect a recognizable coworker. A decrease in recognizable coworkers could thus potentially lead to an increase in unethical behavior by workers (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). Research also suggests that outside observers, not only perpetrators, view unethical behavior as less unethical if the victim of the unethical behavior is unidentified (Gino, Shu, & Bazerman, 2010). This could possibly result in less public outcry against unethical practices in a globalized business environment, where the victims are often unseen.  Moderating factors   Attachment anxiety  High levels of attachment anxiety may increase the power of identifiable victim effect. Research indicates that individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety may donate more to identified victims and donate less to unidentified victims than the average person (Kogut & Kogut, 2013). According to a study by Kogut and Kogut, attachment anxiety may reduce the expression of altruistic tendencies, commonly demonstrated by charitable giving. Researchers hypothesize that this is because anxiously-attached individuals focus their time and energy on dealing with their own vulnerabilities, leaving them no mental energy to focus on the well-being of others. However, this would only be true of the unidentified individual. When faced with an identified victim, individuals who are anxiously attached tend to donate more money than the average individual. This aligns with past research indicating that anxiously attached people experience significantly more personal distress than those securely attached when confronted with victims in need (Mikulincer et al., 2001). Although anxiously-attached people may participate in prosocial behaviors, such as donating money to a charity, their actions are suggested not to be the result of altruistic tendencies, but instead \\"positively correlated with egoistic, rather than altruistic motives for helping and volunteering\\" (Kogut, T. & Kogut E., 2013, p.652). Thus, researchers hypothesize that anxiously attached individuals are more likely to help identified victims only because they will personally benefit. This is possibly because the identified victim can fulfill the desire for personal attachment, not because the victim is in need. It is important to note that their increased helpfulness only extends to easy, effortless actions, such as donating money. It does not extend to particularly difficult or effortful actions, such as donating time (Kogut & Kogut, 2013).  Guilt  Research suggests that guilt reduces the power of the identifiable victim effect (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). Before engaging in a behavior, an individual conducts an assessment of the possible emotional outcomes of that behavior. An individual is drawn towards behaviors that would make them happy and repulsed by those that would make them upset. Thus, a person with a high level of guilt is drawn towards altruistic acts because they serve to alleviate the negative emotions that they are experiencing. Consequently, the presence of guilt may actually increase the occurrence of altruistic behavior, such as charitable donations, regardless of whether the victim they are helping is identified or not. Research also suggests that anticipated guilt reduces the occurrence of unethical behavior that may negatively affect an identified victim (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). This may be because knowingly and negatively affecting a recognizable victim causes the individual engaging in unethical behavior to experience distress and negative emotions.  Reasoning style  Research suggests that individual differences in reasoning style moderate the identifiable victim effect (Friedrich & McGuire, 2010). Two different methods of reasoning are ‚Äúexperiential‚Äù and ‚Äúrational‚Äù. Experiential thinking (e.g. emotionally-based thinking) is automatic, contextual and fluid, and rational thinking (e.g. logically-based thinking) is deliberative, analytical, and decontextualized. Experiential thinking styles may increase the power of the identifiable victim effect, and rational thinking styles may decrease the power of the identifiable victim effect. Researchers theorize that these differences result because experiential thinkers rely on emotional responses towards an issue when making a decision. In contrast, rational thinkers analyze the situation as a whole before making a decision. Thus, a person thinking rationally would respond to all victims equally, not giving preference to those specifically named or otherwise identified, just as experiential thinkers would be drawn towards the more emotionally charged identified victim (Friedrich & McGuire, 2010).  Criticism  The identifiable victim effect has been contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a victim is identified, information such as age and gender of the victim are revealed and people are especially sympathetic in response to that information rather than to identifiability per se. In 2003, Deborah Small and George Loewenstein conducted an experiment that mitigated this issue. Identifiability was strictly limited to the determination of the victim's identity. Therefore, the victim had already been identified regardless of whether the participants had known anything specific about their identity or not. The circumstances of the victim were more palpable and thus elicited greater sympathy from participants. In contrast, the identities of statistical victims were not yet determined. As such, participants found it more difficult to sympathize with indeterminate victims.  Identification  In certain situations, identification of a victim can actually reduce the amount of help offered to that individual. Research suggests that if an individual is seen as responsible for their plight, people are less likely to offer help than if the victim was not identified at all (Kogut, 2011). Most research dedicated to the identifiable victim effect avoids the topic of blame, using explicitly blameless individuals, such as children suffering from an illness (Kogut & Ritov, 2005). However, there are real-world situations where victims may be seen as to blame for their current situation. For example, in a 2011 study by Kogut, individuals were less likely to offer help to an AIDS victim if the victim had contracted AIDS through sexual contact than if the individual was born with AIDS. In other words, individuals were less likely to offer help to victims if they were seen as at least partially responsible for their plight. A meta-study conducted in 2016 supports these findings, reporting that charitable donations were highest when the victim showed little responsibility for their victimization (Lee & Feeley, 2016). In such cases where victim blaming is possible, identification of individuals may not induce sympathy and may actually increase negative perception of the victim (Kogut, 2011). This reduction in help is even more pronounced if the individual believes in the just world hypothesis, which is the tendency for people to blame the victim for what has happened to them. This pattern of blame results from a desire to believe that the world is predictable and orderly and that those who suffer must have done something to deserve their suffering.  Individual applicability  Research may indicate that the identifiable victim effect only affects identified individuals, not identified groups (Kogut & Ritov, 2005). A 2005 study by Kogut and Ritov asked participants how much they would be willing to donate to either a critically ill child or a group of eight critically ill children. Although identification of the individual child increased donations, identification of the group of children as a whole did not. Researchers also found that, although both the individual and group evoked similar amounts of empathy, individual victims evoked more emotional distress than groups of victims. Continuing from this, researchers hypothesized that emotional distress, not empathy, appears to be positively correlated with desire to help, or ‚Äúwillingness to contribute.‚Äù This supports the idea that altruistic acts may serve as coping mechanisms to alleviate negative emotions, such as guilt (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). This also supports earlier research that suggests distress and sympathy are the driving emotional factors behind the identifiable victim effect (Erlandsson, Bj√∂rklund, & B√§ckstr√∂m, 2015).

Its main objective is to develop the interests and opinions of European pharmaceutical students and to encourage contact and collaboration between them. EPSA's motto '\\"Bringing Pharmacy, Knowledge and Students Together\\" reflects its will to promote the ideas and opinions of all European pharmaceutical students in order to improve the Education, the Pharmaceutical Profession and the Scientific Advances regarding Pharmacy. EPSA has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, in PGEU's offices. The Vice President of External Affairs works permanently there, collaborating with the Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union in the promotion of the role of the pharmacist as the key actor in public health. Before being settled in Brussels, EPSA had its headquarters in Leiden, The Netherlands. History In the spring of 1978, the \\"Association Nationale des Etudiants en Pharmacie de France\\" (ANEPF) invited a group of students from various European countries to their congress held in Nancy. The reason for this meeting was to discuss the, at the time, forthcoming European Community (EC) directives on the mutual recognition of pharmacy diplomas within the European Community and compare pharmacy curricula in the different countries. During the meeting, it became obvious that the task at hand was more complicated than anticipated and that results would be difficult to obtain within a short time. However, all participants agreed on the necessity of having discussions and agreements on these topics. The students, therefore, proposed to the International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation (IPSF) to establish a committee, the European Sub-Committee of IPSF, to deal with these topics. The European Sub-Committee (ESC) was thus established at the 1978 IPSF Congress in Edinburgh. In 1982 the ESC became an independent organisation, the European Pharmaceutical Students' Committee, which was officially registered at the Tribunal d'Illkirch, France. The main purpose of the ESC was to work towards diploma equivalence with a view to the free movement of pharmacists within the EC. The subject was approached from different angles and the curricula were compared, however, this proved to be difficult since the names of subjects differed between countries. Nevertheless, a lot of data was collected about the studies in the different countries and a paper titled: 'Pharmacy in Europe, Facts of Pharmacy Education and Practice in European Countries' was produced. The current name of the European Pharmaceutical Students' Association (EPSA) was decided upon ten years after becoming independent, at the 15th ESC congress held in Helsinki in 1992, and took effect from the closure of the 16th ESC Congress, held in T√ºbingen, Germany, in April 1993. EPSA underwent dramatic changes during the 27th EPSA Annual Congress in Pamporovo, Bulgaria, in 2004. Timo Mohnani, EPSA President at the time, and his EPSA Executive initiated these changes. The main purpose of the changes was to bring EPSA as an association closer to its members. This was done by the introduction of Working Committees which consisted of a representative from each member association and worked on a different field of action within the vastness of the pharmaceutical profession. The makeup of the EPSA Executive was only slightly changed with the introduction of a Sponsorship Officer and an EU Officer. In 2005 EPSA launched a major project ‚Äì the Individual Mobility Project (IMP). The main aim was to give students the possibility of having paid internships in pharmaceutical companies, research laboratories or any other fields within the pharmacy profession. This project leads to the creation of the positions of Students Mobility Officer, Central IMP Coordinator and the IMP Board. Later, in 2008, the names given to the EPSA Executive were changed from \\"Officers\\" to \\"Vice Presidents\\". The structure of the EPSA Executive became the following: President, Secretary General, Treasurer, Vice President of Education, Vice President of Communication, Vice President of Partnership Development, Vice President of EU Affairs and Vice President of Mobility. 2009 presented the creation of two new positions: Training Officer and Alumni Officer. At the 39th EPSA General Assembly held in Krak√≥w, Poland, in April 2010, an internal restructuring was made within EPSA: the abolition of Working Committees led to the creation of the Educational Board; the Vice President of Partnership Development and the Vice President of EU Affairs positions were merged into one: Vice President of External Affairs. Another change was made by 43rd EPSA General Assembly which renamed all Officers to Coordinators. In 2014, at the 47th EPSA General Assembly in Budapest, Hungary, a major change was the establishment of a new position in the EPSA Executive - Vice President of Internal Affairs, which became responsible for the internal communication and effectively became the Vice President of the Association. At the 51st General Assembly, which took place in Helsinki, in April 2016, some other significant changes were made. The position of Vice President of Mobility and the Mobility Department were abolished and a new position in the External Relations Department, the Mobility Coordinator, was created. The Vice President of External Affairs portfolio was also divided by two new positions: Vice President of European Affairs and Vice President of External Relations. The Vice President of External Relations became the leader of the External Relations Department, composed by the Mobility Coordinator, Central IMP Coordinator (that were members of the previous Mobility Department) and Professional Affairs Coordinator (that was previously in the Educational Department). With this new position of Vice President of External Relations, the Partnership Coordinator position was also abolished, becoming part of VP ER's portfolio. At the 55th General Assembly, which took place in Baarlo, the Netherlands, a European Affairs Department was established. The department is headed by the Vice President of European Affairs and consist of the Grant Coordinator and the newly established Policy Affairs Coordinator. In addition to this, the position of the Social Media Coordinator as part of the Public Relations Department was established. Today, EPSA represents 100.00 pharmaceutical students from 45 Member Associations and 37 countries. The Association continues to grow and evolve; traditions have developed over the years and are continually created. By agreeing to become an EPSA Liaison Secretary you are continuing one of the oldest and following a long line of dedicated and respected EPSA Members. The original objectives of EPSA were established in 1982 and were expanded and updated at the 21st EPSA Congress in Alcal√° de Henares (Madrid), Spain, in 1998, when the whole structure and running of EPSA was revamped. The current vision and mission of the association, adopted during the 38th EPSA Annual Congress in Toulouse, France, in 2015, are simple: \\"The vision of the association is to represent, reach and engage every single pharmaceutical student in Europe to collaborate on the development of the future of pharmacy and healthcare together.\\" \\"The mission of the association is to actively engage at student and professional level, bringing pharmacy, knowledge and students together while promoting personal development.\\" The EPSA TORSO (Terms of Reference and Standing Orders) exists to ensure that these aims are fulfilled and that the association runs in an appropriate way. Structure General Assembly The EPSA General Assembly (GA) is the highest authority and decision-making body of the Association. Each Ordinary and Associate Member sends up to two Official Delegates to the GA. The GA consists of delegates from all Ordinary and Associate Members of EPSA who speak on behalf of their associations. Observers, such as EPSA Alumni and representatives from other student associations EPSA is collaborating with may also be present at the GA. The voting results and decisions taken at the GA evaluate and define the work of the association and mandate the EPSA Executive to carry out various tasks. The General Assembly takes place two times a year - during the EPSA Annual Congress and the EPSA Autumn Assembly. During the Autumn Assembly, EPSA Team Members present their work for the first half of their mandate and get feedback and suggestions from the members, thus shaping the next half of the year. At the Annual Congress, a new Team is elected/appointed every year. EPSA Team The EPSA Team is elected by the General Assembly every year at the EPSA Annual Congress in April or May and takes office in July. Led by the Executive, the EPSA Team cooperates all year with EPSA Member Associations in order to achieve EPSA goals. Executive The EPSA Executive manages the affairs of the Association and leads the work done in the name of EPSA in multiple fields. The European Sub-Committee (ESC) began with only one executive member, the chairperson. However, as the workload increased, the need for additional board members became apparent. The ESC board was originally elected at IPSF Congresses. However, from 1982 onward, due to the division of IPSF and ECS, the Executive has been elected at ESC Congresses. Until 1998, the Board (composed of President, Vice-President, Secretary and Treasurer) was elected at the Congress, and the rest of the Executive appointed. From 1998 onwards the entire Executive was elected at the Congress and was assisted by a number of sub-committees.

This event is structured around a round table discussion, chaired by the EPSA Vice President of European Affairs, in order to improve EPSA work and projects with the experience and ideas of these professionals. The topic of Annual Reception is chosen by EPSA Executive. WHSS ‚Äì World Healthcare Students' Symposium The WHSS is a multi-professional four-day conference bringing together healthcare students from all around the world. The first joint symposium of world healthcare students took place in Malta from 7 to 12 November 2005. The symposium brought together 230 medical, pharmaceutical and nursing students from 42 countries in an international forum. The conference was intended to generate understanding and discussion between the professions, develop skills and awareness of concepts in multidisciplinary settings, and to create student advocates for a cooperative multidisciplinary approach to patient centred care to optimise health outcomes. There are a number of groups who work together to make this event happen and this includes EPSA. Other students' associations involved are: International Federation of Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA), International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation (IPSF), European Medical Students' Association (EMSA), International Veterinary Students' Association (IVSA), International Association of Dental Students (IADS) and Global Association of Student and Novice Nurses (GASNN). Last WHSS was held in November 2017, in, Rwanda. Publications EPSA Newsletter. Newsletter The EPSA Newsletter is the official EPSA publication. It is published three times a year and is distributed to all EPSA members, contact organisations and sponsors. The Newsletter contains articles from the EPSA Officials, members and professionals and aims to spread EPSA's latest developments regarding its projects and to exchange knowledge and experiences between them. Including a broad variety of topics, it also contributes to the communication between students of member countries, who want to share ideas, comments and experiences. Additionally, it serves to highlight the important issues for pharmaceutical students across Europe and to pass information about future events. Each EPSA Member Association receives copies of the Newsletter that are further distributed to students across Europe, as well as to EPSA Observers and professional associations, in a total of 400 copies per edition. Monthly Dose The EPSA Monthly Dose aims to bring relevant and useful updates about EPSA to students that are not very familiar with the Association.

Information on EPSA Member Associations is shared as well. Projects EPSA Projects and Activities Webinar To bring EPSA closer to its members, an EPSA Projects and Activities Webinar is organised twice per mandate. A transcript is available on the EPSA website. EPSA Events and Educational Calendar The EPSA Events and Activities Calendar is a calendar of educational opportunities accessible to European pharmaceutical students and recent graduates, organised by professionals or EPSA Member Associations. It is available on the EPSA website and in LLeaP. EPSA Member Associations and external partners can promote and showcase their events and activities through this calendar by submitting the official form which is available on the EPSA website. EPSA Alumni Project Since the foundation of EPSA, many students have spent much of their time working for the association. Due to all of them, EPSA is today one of the most respectful associations in Europe. The EPSA Alumni project aims to link the current EPSA Team and members to the old ones, in order to make EPSA grow with the advice, expertise and great example of these people. This project offers the opportunity to maintain contact with all EPSA enthusiasts and also to keep the Alumni benefiting from the association which they had given a lot of time and energy to. Besides previous EPSA Team Members, people eligible to become EPSA Alumni are past LSs, NIMPs and EPSA Trainers. Each of them should fill a specific form if they wish to be granted this status. The EPSA Executive or the General Assembly can grant the EPSA Alumnus status to any other individual they deem has contributed to EPSA sufficiently to be granted with this status. Part of the Alumni Project is also the Alumni Weekend (AW), organised during EPSA Congresses and an Alumni Advisory Board (AAB), established to provide advice and support to the current EPSA Team. Next Generation Chats and Next Generation Training The aim of these projects is to present the work of the EPSA Team to interested EPSA members. The chats take place online around a month before the Annual Congress while the Training takes place in the weekend prior to the Annual Congress. All EPSA members can apply to both, even if they do not wish to run for a position in the EPSA Team, as they are a great way to get to know EPSA better and develop themselves. Education Sharing a multiplicity of different Educational systems all over Europe and feeling gaps to bridge within our education, EPSA believes that this issue is important and an active attitude towards it is needed. The pharmacist, the health professional expert on drugs, has to be conveniently prepared to meet the needs of patients and act as an added value to the healthcare system. Firstly, as future health professionals, we believe that we have to be proactive in health awareness among people and society. Promoting health habits, implementing contagious disease prevention campaigns as well as educational programmes about different social problems are the face forms of our work in this specific matter. Lifelong Learning Platform (LLeaP) The EPSA Lifelong Learning Platform (LLeaP) provides pharmaceutical students who actively engage in professional and educational activities an opportunity to gain tangible credit for these activities. It also introduces, at an early stage in the development of these future healthcare professionals, the important principles of Lifelong Learning, as well as establishes the importance of documenting professional activities and promoting them among fellow students through a Platform. EPSA hopes that LLeaP will help in generating European pharmaceutical graduates prepared for a career-long commitment to Continuing Professional Development. This will hopefully lead to higher quality healthcare for the citizens of Europe. Methodology Booklet The Methodology Booklet is a collection of the European pharmaceutical students‚Äô opinion on the European pharmaceutical education. The opinion is collected through an extensive survey which is heavily promoted. The Methodology Booklet is updated every five years and additional activities, both on the European and on the national/local level are organised throughout the mandates. Webinars and Online Discussion Forums Both of these types of online activities are accessible to all EPSA members. Webinars are presentations on specific topics by professionals, followed by a Q&A; session. Online Discussion Forums are interactive activities with the aim of collecting the opinion of EPSA members on different relevant topics and to encourage dialogue among them. Public Health and Social Services Public health and social services initiatives are very important to EPSA. At the beginning of each mandate, a calendar of public health campaigns and Social Services is created for that mandate. These campaigns are carried out over social media and on the local/national level by the EPSA Member Associations. Members are also encouraged to report on their campaigns and thus share good practices with each other and EPSA. Public Health campaigns are meant to raise awareness of Public Health topics. The main outcome is to let people think about behaviour or point of view towards certain health issues. Examples of Public Health campaigns which were covered by EPSA in the past are Purple Week, World Pharmacist Day, Antibiotic Awareness Week, World No Tobacco Day. Social Services is also a large part of this portfolio. Different social services activities, such as humanitarian runs and clothes drives, blood donations, etc. are organised throughout the mandates at EPSA Events and via social media. Member Associations are again encouraged to share their good practices and experiences. The public health and/or social services coordinators of EPSA Member Associations communicate with each other through different channels coordinated by the EPSA Public Health and Social Services Coordinator. EPSA Science Day The Science Day takes place during the EPSA Annual Congress. The main aim is to present to all EPSA AC participants the work that has been developed by their researcher student colleagues that have carried out research work in their faculties or are doing an MSc/PhD. There is no theme for Science Day: all scientific posters are welcomed, no matter the area of interest. Poster and oral presentation sessions are organised. Those who participate in Science Day have the opportunity to give a 10-minute oral presentation of their work to other participants and the jury with 5 minutes for questions. In the end, the winners of each Science Day session are chosen and awarded. EPSA Science! Monthly This is an EPSA Science project that aims to bring science closer to students. Six different pharmaceutical science articles are presented once a month on the EPSA Website and EPSA Social Media. There is also an option for students to submit science news they have come upon themselves. Participating students will receive credit for their involvement on the EPSA Website. EPSA Science! Monthly is organised around a specific topic each month. Science Excursions Science Excursions allow students interested in science contact with the professional world. They are organised during EPSA Events and locally by the EPSA Member Association. Science Blog Science Blog is an interactive platform aiming to bring science closer to EPSA members. Articles on different topics are published as well as different challenges. EPSA members can publish articles as well. EPSA Training Project Training is a non-formal education that is delivered in an experimental framework. Participants actually have fun while experimenting through a learning activity, which fosters good attitudes towards lifelong learning and self- development. Through Trainings, students‚Äô knowledge of topics that are not usually included in the classical pharmacy curricula (e.g. project management, communication and presentation skills) can be improved. Trainings can be found in EPSA Events but it is also possible to invite EPSA Trainers to your city! The concept of the EPSA Training Project was introduced in 2009, and it is lead within EPSA by the EPSA Training Coordinator. At a further stage, the students that find an inner call and experience the motivation for it can participate to the \\"Training New Trainers\\" event (TNT), on which they receive appropriate training (on topics like learning styles, communication, training design, training delivery etc.) and become part of the EPSA Trainers pool. They will consequently be able to train other students and hence spread the knowledge to others at the local, national and international level. Trainings can be included as a part of any EPSA Event, TWINNET or local event. Erasmus+ grant from the European Commission could also be obtained for these events. EPSA members can engage with the project also through the Training Week, a week of online activities and challenges aimed at promoting the EPSA Training Project; and the Trainers on Tour, a project through which EPSA brings Trainers to interested Member Associations. Social Media Competitions The Public Relations Department organises different social media competitions throughout the mandate and all EPSA members can take part in them. Individual Mobility Project The EPSA Individual Mobility Project (IMP) is a long-term project that gives the opportunity to pharmaceutical students, particularly those in their late years of studies, and recent pharmaceutical graduates from all European countries (members of EPSA) to gain additional real-time work experience, mainly in the fields of research and industry. Consequently, the IMP represents a unique opportunity for students and recent graduates to also gain valuable knowledge of other European countries, cultures, as well as learning and getting to know the European diversity, which is the experiences also encouraged by the European Commission. This project allows the student or graduates to gain experience and knowledge of the working practice and research techniques from the host company/institution in a project that can last between 3 and 12 months. TWINNET Twinnet is a group mobility programme that aims to enhance the connection among EPSA members allowing the transfer of culture, knowledge, and experiences. Twinnet is the ultimate experience that will teach you how to plan and manage a project, embrace intercultural awareness, and accept responsibility. In this mobility project, two, three, or four groups of students coming from different countries make an exchange (Twinnet, Threenet, or a Quartino respectively) and visit each other‚Äôs country. When you are in the hosting group, you are required to organise an event which welcomes a group of pharmacy students from another European country. Students‚Äô Guide The Students' Guide is a platform that offers information on Erasmus opportunities for pharmaceutical students, as well as information on studying and living conditions in different European cities. One part of the core information depicted on the platform is the Erasmus agreements signed between different pharmaceutical faculties. EPSA Humanitarian Mobility Project A humanitarian project provides material or logistical assistance to a group of people or a country in need of aid. Projects vary among those necessitated by man-made disasters, natural disasters, poverty and aid development. As such, the focus of each project differs. Through this project, we want to ensure that students we represent will be provided with an opportunity to travel, volunteer and improve themselves through experiencing solidarity and care for others. It should allow pharmacy students to learn about human rights and how their mistreatment can affect health. EPSA Mentoring Project This project aims to establish a bond between current professionals and students, in order to provide them with career guidance from an international perspective of development. Through this project, EPSA wants to set up a platform that introduces a greater understanding of professional development in pharmacy for students. Once a year, a call for students is opened (in October/November). Interested candidates choose their favourite mentors by filling in the form. Once accepted, they receive specific online workshops and schedule regular meetings with the mentor for a period of 6 months (from January to the end of June). After this period, mentors and mentees are free to stay in touch with each other! Career Page Career Page provides insight information about possible fields of employment for Pharmacists. The page is created based on testimonials and tips from EPSA Alumni as well as results from the Pharmine Project and guidance from professional associations. Links to further sources are provided as the necessary skills for each field, enabling students to evaluate which field they might fit in best. The Career Page is available on the EPSA Website and in LLeaP. Chat with Professionals Chat with Professional is an activity that enables contact between students/recent graduates and professionals. When organised online, a professional briefly presents his field of work and students are then able to ask questions. When organised live at EPSA events, students circulate and talk with different professionals. Career Week Career Week is a week full of online activities connected to professional development. Challenges take place as well. EPSA Members Associations are encouraged to organise similar activities locally. Career Fair Career Fairs are organised at EPSA Events. EPSA and RC partners present themselves through booths and short presentations. Other interactive activities are organised as well. Partners EPSA is working with various institutional, corporate, associative and student partners which are helping us to bring the professional world closer to students but also share good practices amongst student associations. Corporate Partners The updated list is available on the EPSA website. Associative Partners There are various professional associations, who support EPSA with speakers, input to our projects and possibility to attend events on the European level, where EPSA can represent its members: EIPG ‚Äì European Industrial Pharmacists Group TOPRA - The Organisation for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs GIRP - European Healthcare Distribution Association ESCP - European Society of Clinical Pharmacy EAFP ‚Äì European Association of Faculties of Pharmacy EUFEPS - The European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences Think Young Brussels- based EPSA Internship Partners EPSA is present in Brussels, the capital of EU advocacy which is possible thanks to: PGEU ‚Äì Pharmaceutical Group of European Union EAHP ‚Äì European Association of Hospital Pharmacists AESGP ‚Äì Association of the European Self-Medication Industry Medicines for Europe EFPIA ‚Äì European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations SIOPE - The European Society for Pediatric Oncology Students Associations Strong connections with student stakeholders are crucial to interprofessional education and to represent the opinion of future pharmacists: EYE European Youth Event ESN Erasmus Student Network EMSA European Medical Students Association EDSA European Dental Students Association EFPSA European Federation of Psychology Students Association ELSA European Law Students Association ENSA European Nurse Students Association IPSF International Pharmaceutical Students Federation JADE European Confederation of Junior Enterprises ESU European Students Union ESTIEM European Students of Industrial Engineering and Management IFISO Informal Forum of International Students Organizations EPSA is co-funded by Erasmus + Programme of European Union EPSA is also working closely with the International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation (IPSF) - the largest body representing pharmacy and pharmaceutical students and recent graduates in the world. EPSA collaborates with IPSF under a formal Memorandum of Understanding. The organisations work together yearly and have a similar membership base within Europe. EPSA and IPSF frequently share publications, initiatives, promote both associations, and work on behalf of European members to organize joint sessions at events.

The show has one human character, The Harbourmaster, and six central tugboat characters, led by the show's namesake, Theodore Tugboat. Other ships, of all sizes, provide a large number or regular and occasional characters along with a few living structures. Characters from Theodore Tugboat depicted by the studio models used to film the series, now preserved at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax. Characters visible are, from back to front, Kingston, Pearl, The Dispatcher, Hank, Guysborough and Theodore. Main characters The Harbourmaster Along with all the duties of a real-life harbourmaster, The Harbourmaster is the narrator of the series, and provides voices for the entire cast of characters. He is the only human on the show, and is portrayed in the Canadian and US versions by the late Denny Doherty, formerly of The Mamas & the Papas, and by other performers internationally. The Harbourmaster introduces the theme at the beginning of every episode by addressing an issue that he has in common with the tugs. He also loves to play the tuba and is good friends with a man named \\"Rodney\\" (who never appeared in the series). Tugboats * Theodore Tugboat: Theodore is the title character who lives in the Big Harbour with all of his friends. He's one of the smaller tugs that wears a red baseball cap, and is sometimes offended if someone calls him \\"cute\\" or \\"small\\". He and his closest friend Hank are the only two harbour tugs (tugs that are not yet eligible to work outside of the harbour). They both share the harbour tug side of the dock and love working together. This life-size version of Theodore Tugboat, Theodore Too plies the waters of Halifax Harbour He's a kind little tugboat that is always friendly to the other ships in the harbour, with the goal of becoming friends with everyone he meets. His biggest dream is to become an ocean tug and to travel across the sea to different harbours, but before he does, he works as hard as he can to make the Big Harbour the friendliest harbour in the world. That's why he is always there whenever someone needs him. It's hinted that Theodore falls in love with Emily. * Hank: Hank (the Volcano, as he sometimes calls himself) is the smallest, funniest, fastest tugboat in the Big Harbour. He wears a blue tuque and loves to make funny faces and noises as a way of getting attention. He can be very sensitive too, and usually gets ignored for being the smallest. Whenever he feels down, he always turns to Theodore for help or guidance. Hank was afraid of the dark once, but overcomes his fear when Theodore tells him that he was once afraid of the dark too. Sometimes Hank is the one to give a good idea without even knowing it. He also loves to use the word \\"fresh\\" to describe something. Out of all the other tugboats, Hank is special because of his good humour and nature to learn and grow from his mistakes. * Emily \\"the Vigorous\\": Emily is the only female tug in the fleet. She wears an old turquoise fishing hat that is very special to her. She loves to travel to different countries and discover new cultures and languages. Emily loves to be admired, but hates to look silly in front of her friends because they always have high expectations for her, and look up to her as a leader. Still, she always comes to find that her friends are there to help her, even if she doesn't ask for their help. She usually gets into arguments with George, but they always resolve their differences in the end. No matter how upset Emily gets, she always shows her kind spirits and female strength. It's hinted that Emily may have feelings for Theodore. * George \\"the Valiant\\": George is the largest and strongest tugboat in the Big Harbour. He wears a purple baseball cap on his head backwards. George loves to show off and can sometimes be a little rude without knowing it. He's somewhat stubborn and always struggles to admit that he is sometimes wrong. He especially loves to tell stories to the other tugs, mostly about himself. Whenever he gets irritated, he blows up a lot of smoke from his smokestack and makes loud noises with his powerful engines. Most of all, George is a hard worker, never finishes a job until it's done, and always stands up for his friends. * Foduck \\"the Vigilant\\": Foduck is the harbour's safety tug. He wears a red fireman's hat and is equipped with extra bright spotlights, sonar transceiver and a fire hose. Foduck is always very serious and makes sure all jobs are being performed safely. Foduck is a V tug like George and Emily, meaning he is fully qualified to make ocean voyages, but is content with staying in the harbour to keep it safe. Because of his strong work ethic, Foduck usually doesn't express his feelings, but deep inside, he has a soft spot in his heart for everything and everyone in the harbour. The Dispatcher * The Dispatcher: The tugboat Dispatcher is a rotating building on the \\"Great Ocean Tug and Salvage Company\\" wharf (modeled after the wharves of the former Foundation Maritime), who gives the tugs their jobs for the day. He has a black mustache and a flag on his head. He is usually very serious and stern with the tugs, but they are always respectful to him because of his fatherlike figure. He shows that he cares for the tugs by disciplining them for their faults, and by counselling them for their mistakes. And like a father, he always has a gentle side to him, and is always there when the tugboats need his help the most. Other characters * Phillip and Philmore the Ferry Twins: Phillip and Philmore are two identical ferry boat twins that cross the harbour before Benjamin Bridge. The twins are modelled after the twin Halifax Transit ferries Halifax III and Dartmouth III which were built in 1979 to carry passengers across Halifax Harbour on a daily basis. No one in the Big Harbour is able to tell which twin is which, and they usually finish each other's sentences. Phillip and Philmore are sometimes stubborn, and at one point, Philmore left the harbour to visit Fundy the Fishing Boat. Their job is very well recognized, and every tug and ship is careful when they cross between them. * Benjamin Bridge: Benjamin is a green suspension bridge at the end of the harbour who loves to watch everything that goes on. His design is based on the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge, the first of two bridges built to connect the former City of Halifax with the former City of Dartmouth. He also enjoys telling jokes, riddles and rumours, which can cause a lot of confusion. Besides spreading rumours, Benjamin has a bad habit of snoring very loudly. Even though he can't move, Benjamin has many exciting moments, like Tex the Oil Rig nearly crashing into him, or the time the Queen Stephanie got stuck beneath him. He's very good friends with the tugboats and loves to socialize. In the episode \\"Theodore and the Big Harbour\\" he was a bully and called Theodore a put-put, but learned a lesson after Theodore blew smoke in his face and was saved from Tex the oil rig by Theodore and George. Benjamin is seen in every episode, but only talks in a few (Theodore and the Big oil Rig, Theodore and the Queen, Theodore and the Borrowed Bell, and Theodore and the Northern Lights) to name a few. * Donald Dock: Donald is the wooden dock across from the Dispatcher, and also happens to be his best friend. Donald is special because he only uses the words \\"uh- huh\\" and nothing else. The Dispatcher and the tugs sometimes go to him for advice and occasionally get the right answer from him. His name is a pun on Donald Duck, a popular character from Disney. * Pearl and Petra the Pilot Boats: Pearl and Petra are the harbour's only two pilot boats. They patrol the harbour and supervise the tugs with moving ships to their docks. They both used to have a problem with not listening to the tugboats, which caused a lot of confusion. Pearl was the first pilot boat to come to the harbour. She expects a little too much from the tugs and can be very strict with them. She used to be taken as mean and boring until she played a fun game with Theodore. Petra was the second pilot boat to come to the harbour and has a closer relationship with the tugboats. She was shy at first, about coming to the Big Harbour, until Theodore introduced her to everyone. She also enjoys playing \\"hide and surprise\\" with Theodore and Barrington on occasion. Both are hard working, and work together with the tugs to keep the harbour running properly. * Bobby Barge: Bobby is a green salvage barge, who like all the other barges, is good friends with the tugs, and always quiet. Bobby occasionally helps out with Rebecca's salvage operations when Shelburne is on assignment. He is very encouraging and once lifted George's spirits when he didn't win an award. * R. Boat: R. Boat (short for row boat) is a gloomy little row boat that Theodore found stuck on some sharp rocks. R. Boat's dock had been destroyed during a big storm, and Theodore promised him a new home. Three weeks later, R. Boat sunk to the place where ships are lost forever. R. Boat complains very often and hates loud noise. He became good friends with the cruise ship Queen Stephanie when it was discovered they both shared a fondness for a certain dock and a dislike for clams. * The Flat Eyed Coast Guard Ship: The coast guard ship that has flat eyes. He is seen close up in the episode \\"Theodore and the Queen\\". Later, his model was used for Constance. * Bedford Buoy: Bedford is a small buoy that marks the place where the harbour ends and the ocean begins. He and Theodore are best friends, and they love to tell knock- knock jokes to each other. Even though Bedford is not able to move, he sometimes has fun adventures, like when his chain broke and he drifted out of the harbour. Even so, Bedford also suffers from depression because he's unable to move, and once wanted to leave the harbour. That is why every ship in the Big Harbour stops by every day to say hello and talk with Bedford. Whenever Bedford feels useless, the tugs are always there to remind him just how important he really is. * Owan the Oil Rig: Owan is a loudmouth, boisterous, Barney Fife-type, oil rig that works outside the Big Harbour. He has eight big pillars and is hooked onto giant anchor cables. He's full of free expression and always yells instead of talking. The tugs usually have to remind him to be a little more quiet. The funny thing, is Owan never knows when he's too loud. He loves to use catchphrases such as \\"Yessireebob!\\", \\"Nosirreebob!\\" and \\"Oh my star fish and little oysters!\\" Owan is always happy and cheerful (except for when Oliver came to take him to work), and sometimes careless (like when he broke free from his cables and nearly hit a cliff). * Barrington Barge: Barrington is the smallest barge in the Big Harbour. He is always quiet like all the other barges, and is best friends with Theodore. The two have a special game of hide and surprise, but once hid too long and got into trouble. Barrington looks up to Theodore as a leader, and never goes against his plans or ideas. * Bonavista Barge: Bonavista is a small red barge who usually works with Hank. She is always calm and content with whatever goes on. Carla the Cabin Cruiser once towed Bonavista to a little cove as a way of getting attention. * Northumberland: Northumberland is a naval submarine who sleeps during the day and works during the night. He is hardly ever awake in view of the tugs, except for when Theodore and Hank saw him on their night shift. Northumberland is a very quiet sub too, and hates loud noises and bright lights. He also helps the salvage crew (Theodore, Rebecca and Shelburne) to find great things underwater. He never likes to disappoint his friends, which can sometimes get him or his friends into danger. He once broke his propeller in an underwater rock slide, and showed Hank where a sunken ship was. Northumberland is also a big brother-like figure to Pugwash the Mini-Sub, but was once scared that she would bump him. Northumberland is always a great help to the tugs and the salvage crew, and whether he's awake or half-awake, he is always willing to be of some assistance to anyone in the Big Harbour. * Rebecca the Research Vessel: Rebecca is a research vessel who explores everything about the ocean. Rebecca had three different models throughout the first two seasons. She started out with a grey colour and had no eyebrows in season one. In season two, her eyes were bigger, and her eyebrows were thick and grey, but later had smaller eyes and grey eyebrows. She is great at giving facts and information about the ocean, and once advised Theodore to let Walter the Whale return to his family. Rebecca is the leader of the salvage team and works with Theodore, Northumberland, and Shelburne to find great things underwater. Rebecca has no trouble finding underwater treasures with her special sonar equipment. She and the salvage team once found and old ship's bell. Theodore looks up to Rebecca because she always does everything close to perfect. Rebecca also has a grumpy side, which she showed when Benjamin Bridge kept her up all night with his loud snoring. Even though Rebecca is not perfect, she is always fun to explore with, and is the tugs closest guide to the mysteries of the sea. * Bluenose the Sailing Ship: Bluenose is a schooner sailing ship that lives in the Big Harbour and holds the title of \\"the fastest ship in the harbour\\" (considering that she has no engine). Bluenose is good friends with the tugs and loves to race with them. She even helped Foduck when his propeller was clogged in seaweed. Bluenose is modelled after Bluenose II, a replica of the famous racing-and-fishing schooner featured on the Canadian ten-cent piece. * Blankton Buoy: A buoy who needed repairs when Elo Echo was coming. * Digby the Cable Ship: Digby is an old cable ship who is always getting stuck somewhere on the job. It's always a surprise to him and the tugs when someone other than himself gets stuck. He has a thick Newfoundland accent and uses catchphrases such as \\"Oh flibberty jibberty!\\" and \\"Oh my starfish and little oysters\\" (like Owan). His best friend is Theodore, who always seems to have to rescue Digby whenever he gets stuck. He loves to say whatever is on his mind, and especially enjoys talking about cables. The tugs once thought of Digby as old and useless when the big and strong Dartmouth came to the harbour. Even though Digby is always getting stuck somewhere, he always shows that he is still a useful cable ship in the end. * The Broken Buoys: In the episode \\"Theodore Changes Sides\\", the Dispatcher assigns Theodore and Hank to move the broken buoys. One was black with a flag on it, the other was green, twisted, and had eyes. The green twisted buoy can be seen at the junk dock in some other episodes. The broken buoys never speak. * Constance the Coast Guard Ship: Constance is a coast guard ship who takes almost everything seriously. Whenever her name is mentioned, she is noted as an important ship. The tugs used to think that Constance was mean, and Constance used to think that she was too busy to be nice. Emily soon showed her how easy it was to be friendly, and became Constance's best friend. Even though Constance is very serious about her work, she can also be a lot of fun (like when she played light tag with Theodore and Hank). The tugs are now more comfortable socializing with Constance, but still give her all their respect. * Carla the Cool Cabin Cruiser: Carla is a zany cabin cruiser who only works to please herself. She loves to give the tugs funny nicknames and usually refers to the Dispatcher as the \\"Dishwasher\\". Carla is always looked at as 'cool' because she's never afraid to do what she wants. She occasionally runs out of control and creates peer pressure amongst the tugs. Carla mainly hangs out with Emily, and loves to go exploring with her. Whenever Carla goes over the line, Emily is usually the one to tell her so, and Carla always knows when she has made a big mistake. * Guysborough the Garbage Barge: Guysborough is a grumpy garbage barge who always describes everything as \\"rotten\\". Theodore and Digby are the only ones that can stand Guysborough's grouchiness. His way of calling Theodore's names is by saying \\"Theee-o-dooore!\\". He once used his catchphrase as a foghorn to prevent a shipwreck. Guysborough usually gets advice from his good friend Jasper, and says to him \\"I thought so too\\". Even though Guysborough is a smelly old garbage barge, the tugs appreciate him for keeping the harbour so nice and clean. * Shelburne the Giant Sea Barge: A giant sea barge designed for longer journeys on the open ocean. He sometimes requires two tugs to move. He has a very slow and sluggish nature which is epitomized by his slow speech. Shelburne is often seen helping the tugs raise items up off the ocean floor and back to the surface. * Jasper the Junk Dock: Jasper is the garbage dock who is the exact opposite of Donald, because the only thing he can say is \\"nope\\". Jasper is a good friend of Guysborough, who always turns to Jasper for advice, even when his answer is always \\"nope\\". * Blandford Buoy: Blandford is a marker buoy at the outermost edge of the harbour, who serves as the first entry point for incoming ships. He is friends with Bedford Buoy, even though they never see each other and rely on passing ships to pass communications to each other. * Sigrid the Supply Ship: Sigrid is a supply ship that takes supplies to Owan the Oil Rig out on the ocean. She is orange with a helicopter on her head, and is especially good at making waves. Sigrid is very good friends with the tugboats and has always wanted to be a tugboat herself. She got her chance when she helped Theodore and Emily dock a ship in a storm by pushing the ship with her waves. The tugs gave Sigrid a green bumper to wear on her side, but instead, she put the bumper on her wheelhouse to remind her of the time when she was a tugboat too. * Nautilus the Navy Ship: Nautilus is a navy ship ( A St. Laurent-class destroyer, specifically) who lives in the harbour, close to Rebecca's dock. George used to be shy around him, because Nautilus is a very important ship. He is the sleekest and the fastest ship in the Big Harbour. * Bayswater Barge: Bayswater is a small green and blue barge that loves to make up funny names. He once called Hank a \\"bumper-bum\\", which got Hank into trouble when he called a ship \\"Needlenose\\". Bayswater is good friends with Brunswick Barge, but at one time didn't get along with him. The two are now very close, and are usually pulled by Theodore and Hank. * Brunswick Barge: Brunswick is a large orange/brown barge that's always looking for thrills and chills. Brunswick quickly changed his mind when he was swept away by a storm and thought that he had been swallowed by a giant snorkel clam. * Bingham Buoy: A buoy-in-training who Hank bumped into one time. Characters outside the Big Harbour * Bullfrog: This bullfrog lives in a cove outside the harbour. * Truro the Fishing Trawler: A fishing trawler who lives and cares for Dorothy Dory in Ceilidh's Cove. * Dorothy Dory: A dory who lives in Ceilidh's Cove with Truro, who looks to both Truro and Theodore as older siblings. Dorothy is always loud and bursting with questions for Theodore and all the other tugboats. Dorothy also got to have a \\"girls night out\\" with Emily, Sigrid, and Carla. * Fundy the Fishing Boat: A little fishing boat who says strange things. It is really his way of giving advice. Fundy and Theodore often spoke in the series, and the Ferry Twins have met him by travelling to his cove. * Baddeck the Buoy Boat: A buoy boat who brings new buoys into the harbour. Theodore was once jealous of Baddeck and his relationship with Bedford and Blandford, but they soon became friends. * Halliburton Houseboat: Halliburton is a houseboat who lives in an enclosed cove near the Big Harbour. Theodore once thought Halliburton was a haunted houseboat, making him scared. Thanks to Foduck, Theodore and Halliburton became fast friends. * Millie: A fishing trawler who wears glasses. When she arrived in the harbour, she caused some trouble with her bad eyesight, but gained two friends in Theodore and Hank. * The Rock Brothers: When Pugwash was hiding from Lunenburg Lighthouse she discovered the rock brothers (three pairs of eyes in the underwater cave). They surprised her when they mentioned her fear of foghorns. They have only appeared in the episode \\"Theodore's Big Decision\\". * Oliver: A tugboat who bullied Theodore. Visitors to the harbour Oil tankers * Olympia: An oil tanker brought in when huge packs of sea ice were in the harbour. She almost ran into Willy's Island when Theodore's towrope snapped. * Linda: An oil tanker that arrives the same time each week. She is towed in by Theodore and Hank, and led into the harbour by Foduck and Pearl. * Canso Colossus: Apparently the \\"King of Supertankers\\". He talks with a squeaky voice and his pet peeve is \\"yucky stuff\\". He almost left the harbour when he saw garbage floating in the water. He once hit rock near the Pictou Peaks and had to be saved by Nautilus. In the episode \\"Sigrid and the Bumpers\\", he was mistaken for a female container ship. * Igloo: An oil tanker who helped the tugs when Clair began to leak oil. Container ships * Margaree Pride: A container ship that George and Theodore helped out of the harbour, the day after Theodore first arrived. * Gloria Cornwallis: A ship that Emily and Theodore were towing during a time when Theodore was having nightmares of a sea monster coming at him in the night.

Clementine becomes paranoid whenever anything happens to one of her containers. * Cumberland: A big container ship with special engines (port thrusters) that allows him to dock himself. He thought he did not need tugs until he met Theodore. * Catherine: A big container ship who carried a double load, and gave Theodore and George a difficult time trying to move her. * Caraquet: A container ship that Theodore had trouble keeping steady when George was doing tough tugging. Caraquet had many speaking roles (she appears to have a British accent), including a time when she, Theodore, and Hank had a good laugh when George made a funny noise. * Chester: A blue and red container ship who wanted to have flags during the time the ships and boats of the harbour were having their flag day. * Cocomagh: A container ship who was afraid to come into the harbour until Foduck convinced her that the Big Harbour was the friendliest harbour in the whole world. Cargo ships * Julia: The first cargo ship that Theodore and Hank brought into the harbour together. She was loaded with vegetables. After the episode \\"Theodore the Vegetable\\", she made cameos in the first season. * Kirby: A grey cargo ship loaded with telephone poles from England who got nervous when Theodore approached him too quickly. He appeared in the episode \\"Theodore's First Pull\\". * Katherine: A red cargo ship who, like Emily, had never met a ship from Russia until Gregor was in the harbour. She also once said that Theodore's whistle was cute. * Freda: A small red cargo ship that got stuck on some rocks outside the harbour, but Theodore and George teamed up to pull her to safety. She was the first ship Theodore brought in by himself, when he was the \\"Tug in Charge\\". * Margaret: A large green cargo ship that visits the Big Harbour occasionally.

Malarkey: A cargo ship who tells stories that, true to his namesake, are nothing but malarkey. * Seabright: A cargo ship that was afraid of things that he has never done before. He feared that he would get stuck under Benjamin Bridge (since he had never gone under a bridge before) until Theodore explained there was nothing to be afraid of. After Seabright overcame his fear of Benjamin, he soon became frightened of Clayton, since he had never been loaded or unloaded by a crane before. Other visitors * Queen Stephanie: The greatest and grandest ocean liner in the world, also the nicest. Occasionally visits the harbour after getting stuck beneath Benjamin Bridge by accident, the first time she appeared in the series. In another, she even had R. Boat in her swimming pool after he wished he could be big. Apparently, Her Majesty has about 1,001 windows on each of her sides. The queen holds a special place in her heart for Theodore. She's based on the RMS Queen Elizabeth. * Tex the Oil Rig: An oil rig that was really rude until a storm nearly made him crash into Benjamin Bridge, after which he learned humility. * The Mysterious Grain Ship: A ship that made cameos in the first season. In the episode \\"Theodore the Vegetable\\", he cuts off Julia. He is also seen in the episode \\"Theodore and the Queen\\", when all the boats are whistling. He does not speak. * Walter the Whale: Possibly a pilot whale or false killer whale (due to his black color), Walter the whale was separated from his pod by a strong current. Theodore had been babysitting him until George found his family. Walter was returned to his pod before he grew to a tremendous size. He is featured in the book \\"Theodore and the Whale\\". * Snorri the Viking Ship: A Viking ship that arrived in the Big Harbour. The tugs were afraid of him because he snorted at them, until they realized that Snorri is different from the other boats who live in the Big Harbour. * Gregor: A fishing trawler from Russia whom Emily wanted to meet. His model was later used for Truro. * Kulu the Canoe: A story-telling canoe. Saved by Theodore and Foduck when he ran aground on a beach. * Shamus: An Irish fishing trawler that was once covered in ice, and later, when the ice melted, struck up a friendship with George. * Oliver the Vast: A tug from a different harbour who mistreated everyone, especially Theodore. Later, the Dispatcher sends him back home for bullying. After his appearance in the episode \\"Theodore and the Bully\\", his model was used for Sigrid the Supply Ship in the next season. * Dartmouth the Giant Cable Ship: A giant cable ship who won the attention of all the tugboats when he first arrived in the Big Harbour. Digby showed him good places to lay cables. When it was time for him to leave, Theodore felt very sad until he realized that he's not losing a companion, but gaining a friend in a whole new place. * Cabot's Cargo: After Cabot had let some of the cargo fall off his deck, Theodore felt bad, until the cargo spoke to him! Various pieces included a cylinder-like container, a crate, an open shipping container, and a red pipe. Some cargo stayed on his deck that also had faces. There was also a blue container, and what appears to be a water heater. * Pugwash: A yellow mini-sub who scared Northumberland by bumping him, but later decided to stop. She is good friends with Theodore, Hank, and Northumberland. She doesn't like foghorns, and once hid from Lunenburg in the Ecum Secum Circle where she met the Rock Brothers. Owan says that she's as cute as a \\"catfish's kittens\\". * Stewiacke: The ship that carries Pugwash out in the ocean. He likes to explore the ocean with Pugwash as his underwater aid. Buildings and structures * Chimey the Clock Tower: Chimey is the harbour's clock tower. He is seen in many episodes but only speaks once. In the episode \\"Big Harbour Fools' Day\\", Chimey is mentioned by name, and we discover he is the Tugboats' personal wake up call. Chimey is modelled after the historic Halifax Town Clock on Citadel Hill. * The Buildings: There are some buildings in the harbour with faces, but have never been spoken of or had the chance to speak. These include the red warehouses and the long blue house. * Lilly the Lighthouse: A lighthouse on Willy's Island, found in the middle of the harbour, warns visiting ships away from the sharp dangerous rocks on the island. Although she doesn't appear as often as some of the other characters, it is possible that Lilly's character is a nod to Lillie Lightship of TUGS, as both characters use large beacons to warn ships of the fog, and their names are both Lillie/Lilly. * Clayton the Harbour Crane: A crane who lives under Benjamin Bridge. Clayton is very nice, and is a good friend of the tugboats. There once was a time when Theodore wanted to be just like Clayton. In some episodes, Clayton does not have a face. * Shediac the Shipyard Shed: A supply shed Theodore met while he was at the repair dock. He supplies the tugboats their bumpers. Shediac is also Hank's friend. * Lunenburg the Lighthouse: A lighthouse that lives near Shipwreck Rock. Pugwash was once scared of Lunenburg's bright light and loud foghorn. Lunenburg was also seen the time that Theodore was separated from Pearl in the thick fog near Shipwreck Rock. Characters not seen * Rodney: The Harbourmaster's friend who works in the harbour. He plays the bagpipes and is in The Big Harbour Band. * Molly the Vehement: A tug from a different harbour that won the \\"tug of the year\\" award. George says that she is a hard worker. She was only mentioned in the episode \\"Tug of the Year\\". * Natalie Explorer: A ship who was mentioned by the Harbourmaster in the episode \\"George and the Underwater Mystery\\". * Conrade Explorer: A ship mentioned in the episode \\"Theodore's Big New Friend\\". * Aunt Ruby: Rodney's aunt, who he was trying to call in the episode \\"Hank Hurts a Ship\\", but kept calling the Harbourmaster by accident. * Hillary: The mail lady. She delivered cookies to the Harbourmaster in the episode \\"Bedford's Big Move\\", and a binder in the episode \\"Guysborough's Garbage\\". * The Harbourmaster's mom: The Harbourmaster has talked to his mother on the phone. He thanked her for the cookies in the episode \\"Bedford's Big Move\\". In the episode \\"Emily and the Rocket\\", the Harbourmaster mistakens her for the person at the oil refinery, and says she's being rude. Other boats * Kamel: AKA \\"The Old Wreck\\". Kamel is an old cable ship that was seen in some season one episodes. It was first seen in \\"The Dark and Scary Cove\\". Later, it was in the episode \\"True Blue Friends\\" were Theodore, Foduck, and Emily took it to the junk dock. The last episode it was in, was \\"Great Harbour Cleanup Contest\\", where it was under-water, and George tried to tow it away. Kamel has a face, but no eyes (meaning that it is dead). Its model was later used as \\"Digby the Cable Ship\\" in \\"George's Ghost\\". * Junk Barge: A grimy barge full of junk, at Old Dock No.9.

The dish dates from Roman times when the main ingredients were wild birds and animals such as partridge, pheasant, deer, and hare. The pies reached their most elaborate form in Victorian England, with complex recipes and specialized moulds and serving dishes. Modern versions are simpler but savoury combinations of rabbit, venison, pigeon, pheasant, and other commercially available game.Mark Hix Game pie; Serves 4‚Äì6 26 November 2005 Independent Early history Game pies were consumed by the wealthy in the days of the Roman Empire. Wilhelm Adolf Becker states that the emperor Augustus consumed pies that contained chicken, pheasants, pigeon, and duck. In the Middle Ages, \\"bake mete\\" described a pie in which meat or fish is baked with fruit, spices, etc. The meats and sauces were placed in a tough and inedible pastry shell, or \\"coffin\\" with a lid sealed on, then baked. There was no pan: the pie shell itself acted as the container. Frequently the pastry was considered superfluous and was discarded. The process of raising the sides of the pie to form a strong protective crust is described in old cookery books as \\"raising the coffin\\". The term \\"mete\\" referred to the pie, not the meat: a 15th-century cookbook gives a bake mete recipe for a pear custard pie. Describing the franklin in the 14th-century classic The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer said: \\"Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous, Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentvous\\". The best meat might be reserved for the wealthy, while their servants ate inferior pies made of the left-over \\"umbles\\" ‚Äì liver, heart, tripes, and other offal, hence the term \\"eating humble pie\\". In medieval times, birds that might be found in a game pie included heron, crane, crow, swan, stork, cormorant, and bittern as well as smaller birds trapped by nets such as thrushes, starlings, and blackbirds. The 15th-century cookery book Un Vyaunde furnez sanz nom de chare describes a croustade of veal, herbs, dates, and eggs baked in a coffin, but other sources describe croustades of chicken and pigeon. Birds were often placed on top of game pies as ornaments, or 'subtelties', a practice that continued into the Victorian age. An 1890s edition of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management shows a game pie topped by a stuffed pheasant. Tudor and Stuart periods Through most of the period of the Tudor and Stuart monarchs, roughly from 1500 to 1685, it was common for the rulers and their courtiers to stage elaborate feasts where the attraction was as much the entertainment provided by musicians, comedians, jugglers and acrobats as the food itself. Sometimes the two were combined. Around 1630, at a dinner attended by Charles I, a huge game pie was placed on the table. But when the crust was removed, a dwarf armed with sword and buckler sprang from the coffin. On another occasion, the king was served a surprise pie containing live birds, perhaps the origin of the rhyme \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\". The game pies of that period were sweeter than in later times, often containing fruit as well as meat, game and spices. The Tudor Christmas Pie was a rich pie of traditional birds such as partridge, chicken and goose with a recent addition, the turkey, which had been introduced to England from the New World in 1523. Game pie was not restricted to the rich. Until the 1816 Gaming act, country people had the right to catch small game such as rabbits and pigeons to supplement their diet. More valuable game were reserved for the rich, but perhaps not entirely successfully. Shakespeare in The Merry Wives of Windsor alludes to a Venison pasty made from \\"ill-killed\\" deer. France In 1653 Fran√ßois Pierre La Varenne published his groundbreaking work Le P√¢tissier fran√ßois. On the frontispiece is a country kitchen where the cook is making a game pie surrounded by the dead game that would have been included. The Oreiller de la Belle Aurore is an elaborate game pie named after Claudine-Aurore R√©camier, the mother of Jean Anthelme Brillat- Savarin. The large square pie, which was one of her son's favorite dishes, contains a variety of game birds and their livers, veal, pork, truffles, aspic, and much else, in puff pastry. It is described in the classic encyclopedia of gastronomy, the Larousse Gastronomique.  Golden age of game pies in England Substitutes for bread; ‚Äì or ‚Äì right honorables, saving the loaves, and dividing the fishes. By James Gillray In the 18th century, game pies prepared for the prosperous gentry could be very elaborate. Hannah Glasse, in her best-selling The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy, first published in 1747, gave a recipe for a Christmas pie that included pigeon, partridge, a chicken and a goose, all boned and placed one inside the other, and then placed within an enormous turkey. In his 1816 autobiography William Hutton recalls of his maternal grandmother: > She was a careful yet liberal housekeeper, and well skilled in cookery, > pastry, and confectionery. I have heard of a pie she raised in the form of a > goose trussed for the spit; the real goose was boned; a duck was boned and > laid within it; a fowl was boned and laid within the duck; a boned partridge > within the fowl; and a boned pigeon within the partridge. The whole having > been properly seasoned, the interstices were filled with rich gravy. Benjamin Disraeli in his novel Venetia describes an English dinner around 1770 that included > ...that masterpiece of the culinary art, a great battalia pie, in which the > bodies of chickens, pigeons, and rabbits, were embalmed in spices, cock's > combs, and savoury balls, and well bedewed with one of those rich sauces of > claret, anchovy, and sweet herbs ... [on] the cover of this pastry ... the > curious cook had contrived to represent all the once-living forms that were > now entombed in that gorgeous sepulchre. At some point, it became customary for game pies to be served cold. An enormous game pie was made for the Earl of Sefton in the first part of the 19th century to be presented to the corporation of Liverpool. It contained a great variety of game, stuffed one bird within another, as well as truffles, veal, bacon and other ingredients. The meats were first cooked, then cooled with ice and placed in a huge pastry shell with a crust, which was further cooked for three hours. After pouring a hot aspic sauce into the pie through a funnel, it was allowed to cool again for two days before being served cold. The 1845 cookbook The practical cook, English and foreign describes similar game pies of chickens, pigeons, partridges, hares, rabbits, pheasants, gray plovers, grouse, wild fowls or small birds, which may have slices of ham added. With all of these, calf's foot jelly or the bone of a knuckle of veal stewed down to a jelly was added to form aspic when the pie was cooled. The cold pie would then be sliced and served in the same way as its relative, the modern pork pie. Moulds and dishes In the second half of the 18th century, potters such as Josiah Wedgwood introduced industrial processes that made it practical to mass-produce glazed pottery containers capable of withstanding the heat of the oven, at relatively low prices. Following a suggestion by Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1786, Wedgwood started making game pie dishes with an inner liner to hold the contents and an ornamental cover. These were a useful alternative to the traditional pastry coffin, since there were endemic shortages of wheat at this time caused by the early industrial revolution coupled with the disruption of trade during the Napoleonic wars Wedgwood's dishes often had raised bas-relief ornaments of dead game and vine leaves, and a lid handle often modeled on a hare or root vegetable. Some designs gave the illusion of a pastry coffin and lid. William Jesse in his 1844 biography of Beau Brummel says this design was introduced in 1800 when the royal household prohibited the use of flour for pastry in their kitchens, using rice instead. The invention of the sprung metal pie form made it possible to use a finer pastry than the old-fashioned hot water crust pastry, and also to impart much finer decorative detail to the surface of the pastry. The moulds were sold in many different designs. The potter Herbert Minton introduced Majolica wares in 1851, earthenware ceramics decorated with relief figures and brilliant glazes. Until not long before, only the aristocracy and the gentry had had the right to consume game and there were still many restrictions. Expensive Majolica game pie dishes, draped with images of sumptuous game animals, were used by aspiring middle-class families to signal that they had the wealth or connections to obtain the game that they served to their guests legally rather than through the black market. Later Victorians and the 20th century As the Victorian age advanced, the middle classes grew rapidly, with aspirations to a lifestyle that had been reserved to the privileged few. Pioneers such as Alexis Soyer introduced new cooking techniques for the masses based on scientific principles and gas ovens. Mrs. Beeton addressed a broad audience in her 1861 Book of Household Management, giving simple recipes for grouse and partridge pie and for preparing other common game such as wild duck, hare, corn-crake, pheasant, plovers, ptarmigan, quail, venison, etc. The game pie gradually waned in snob appeal and popularity. In The Mating Season, P.G. Wodehouse notes that Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright once hit the game pie at the Drones six times with six consecutive bread rolls from a seat at the far window. In Vile Bodies, a novel about the period between the first and second world wars, Evelyn Waugh describes the game pie at Shepheard's, a fictional club, as \\"quite black inside and full of beaks and shot and inexplicable vertebrae\\". Modern variants Game pie as served in a cafe in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland Many restaurants today serve game pies and there are many modern recipes, but they are usually quite different from the traditional cold game pie. Commonly they contain a savoury stew of commercially available meats such as rabbit and venison, quail and pheasant, but not birds such as pigeons, thrushes, starlings, blackbirds, and crows that were commonly used in the past. They are usually served hot, and may have no shell but only a pastry cover ‚Äì or in restaurants only a puff-pastry lid added at the last minute.

Lauritzen A/S Lines that were almost synonymous with ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) shipping through the early years of Australia's official Antarctic program. Others in the fleet included Kista Dan, Magga Dan and Thala Dan.  Service  Nella Dan ready to leave Hobart, 1987 Nella Dan leaving Hobart, 1987 Commissioned by Lauritzen with considerable input from the Australian Antarctic Division, Nella Dan was named in honour of Nel Law, wife of the AAD Director of the time, Phillip Law. Built by the Aarlborg Shipyard Pty Ltd in 1961, she incorporated all the features of her older sisters, Thala Dan, Kista Dan and Magga Dan. An ice breaker stern, ice fins and ice knife were becoming regular features, but a novel addition was the double hull in the engine room and part of the holds. The ascent to the crow's nest was through the interior of the mast, and the ship supplied its own fresh water with an Atlas generator. At the time of her construction, Nella Dan was regarded as setting the standard for polar vessels. Nella Dan sailed to the Antarctic every year she was chartered by ANARE, from 1962 to 1987. Her service record remains unchallenged as the longest continuously serving of any Antarctic ship.  Besetment (locked in the ice) in 1985  Nella Dan enjoyed the dubious distinction of plunging her passengers into an unexpected seven-week stationary sojourn in the ice in 1985, the longest besetment (being surrounded by ice without helm control) ever experienced by any ANARE ship. She was eventually released from besetment by digging the ice away from the hull. At that time, the Japanese icebreaker Shirase rushed to assist the trapped vessel. Nella Dan finally followed the trail of Shirase and got away from the iced-over ocean.  Final Voyage  On her last fateful voyage on the evening of 3 December 1987, during resupply operations at Macquarie Island, bad weather blew up. Nella Dan dragged her anchor and was driven aground just metres off the island, while transferring fuel from the ship to the sub-Antarctic station. Other cargo unloading had ceased because of strong winds and high seas. A definitive cause of the accident was never determined, it was reported that Nella Dan dragged her anchor in very heavy seas while at the normal anchorage point in Buckles Bay. The vessel was rapidly washed onto rocks close to the research station it was supplying. Damage to the vessel was immediate and serious, the ship's hull was holed in two places and water flooded the engine room. Most of the expedition staff were ashore at the time of the accident, but 17 expedition staff were aboard together with the crew. There were no casualties or injuries to the crew or expedition personnel. Several members of the 35 Water Transport Squadron attached to ANARE sailed three LARC (Light Amphibious Resupply Craft) to evacuate the Antarctic expeditioners and ship's crew still on board. For these actions, soldiers Philip Wharton Clark, Kenneth Stanley Barrington, Dudley Raymond Crowe, Timothy Gay, Gregory Dale Kenny, and Alistair Andrew Scott were awarded a Group Bravery Citation by the Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce on 17 August 2009. The Macquarie Island station, normally designed to accommodate 32 expeditioners, had to accommodate over 100 people until their rescue. At the time of the accident Icebird, another vessel chartered by the Australian Antarctic Division, was returning to Hobart from Davis Station in Antarctica. Icebird was immediately diverted to Macquarie Island to pick up the personnel and crew from Nella Dan. She arrived at Buckles Bay on 8 December 1987.  Scuttling  Within four days of the accident, the owners of Nella Dan, the Danish Lauritzen company, had chartered an oil rig tender, Lady Lorraine, which left Victoria carrying company representatives as well as insurance assessors, a team of divers and salvage experts. To protect the ship from further damage while awaiting possible salvage, the vessel deliberately took on sea water as ballast. This was intended to add sufficient weight to the hull to hold it in position on the rocks and prevent further damage or movement back out to sea. Although having a list of about 11 degrees, the ship was kept in a stable position and was also secured with cables to the shore. When the storm abated all remaining expedition equipment was removed from the ship. Although plans were initially made to salvage the vessel, the decision was eventually made to scuttle her. At 5.42 pm on 24 December 1987, she was sunk in deep water off Macquarie Island. To continue supporting the expedition program the Australian Antarctic Division chartered the Canadian vessel Lady Franklin, an ice-strengthened cargo vessel, for the remainder of the summer season.

The matching takes place through strategy and it is therefore vital that the company has the actual resources and capabilities to execute and support the strategy. Strategic fit can be used actively to evaluate the current strategic situation of a company as well as opportunities such as M&A; and divestitures of organizational divisions. Strategic fit is related to the Resource-based view of the firm which suggests that the key to profitability is not only through positioning and industry selection but rather through an internal focus which seeks to utilize the unique characteristics of the company‚Äôs portfolio of resources and capabilities.Grant, Robert M. (2007) \\"Contemporary Strategy Analysis: Concepts, Techniques, Applications, 6th Edition\\", Wiley- Blackwell A unique combination of resources and capabilities can eventually be developed into a competitive advantage which the company can profit from. However, it is important to differentiate between resources and capabilities. Resources relate to the inputs to production owned by the company, whereas capabilities describe the accumulation of learning the company possesses. Class Resources can be classified both as tangible and intangible: Tangible: *Financial (Cash, securities) *Physical (Location, plant, machinery) Intangible: *Technology (Patents, copyrights) *Human resources *Reputation (Brands) *Culture Several tools have been developed one can use in order to analyze the resources and capabilities of a company. These include SWOT, value chain analysis, cash flow analysis and more. Benchmarking with relevant peers is a useful tool to assess the relative strengths of the resources and capabilities of the company compared to its competitors. Strategic fit can also be used to evaluate specific opportunities like M&A; opportunities. The strategic fit would, in this case, refer to how well the potential acquisition fits with the planned direction (strategy) of the acquiring company. In order to justify growth through M&A; transactions the transaction should yield a better return than Organic growth. The Differential Efficiency Theory states that the acquiring firm will be able to increase its efficiency in the areas where the acquired firm is superior. In addition, the theory argues that M&A; transactions give the acquiring firm the possibility of achieving positive synergy effects meaning that the two merged companies are worth more together than the sums of their parts individually.Ivey Management Services (1995) ‚ÄúA note on mergers and acquisitions and valuation‚Äù, Ivey This is because merging companies may enjoy from economies of scale and economies of scope.

He belonged to the eclectic school of Confucian philosophy, and his thought can be considered as the starting point of the eclectic brand of Confucianism. Life Born in Hirashima Village, Owari Province, to a wealthy scholar family who later gave up their status to become farmers, Hosoi spent the first nine years of his life there as a student in a local temple. On becoming the top student, he was sent to Kyoto and Nagoya at age 17 where he studied under Nakanishi Tanen. It was during this time that Hosoi gained an education in the Chinese classics and when he was a young adult, he began giving lectures to daimy≈çs and commoners. After being taught in Nagoya, Hosoi moved to Nagasaki, where he would remain for three years until he was forced to return home to take care of his ailing mother. After doing so, Hosoi moved back to Nagoya, where he opened up a school, but after a short time he decided to close the school down so that he could relocate to Edo in an effort to reestablish relations with his former teacher.Robert Cornell Armstrong \\"Light from the East: Studies in Japanese Confucianism\\" (1914) In 1780, Hosoi was able to secure a position as a teacher in Owari, where he occupied areas of land to be used as places where he could give his lectures and educate the local people.Louis Fr√©d√©ric, K√§the Roth \\"Japan encyclopedia\\" (2005) Philosophy and thought Hosoi's thought was a mixture of lessons from all the schools of Confucianism existent at the time. His philosophy emphasized practicality, independence of thought, and bringing the teachings of Confucius to the general population. He believed that the scholars of the other schools made the teachings too complicated and disliked any kind of speculative thought. The practical emphasis of his teachings, along his focus on the economic conditions of the common person won him many disciples, who gave him the name of Living Buddha. One of these disciples, Uesugi Yozan, would become famous as a model daimy≈ç, using Hosoi as an advisor during his reform programs. According to Hosoi's philosophy, there is an internal sincere purity within everyone as well as in the natural world. This purity, which he called makoto, was the basis for all ethical action. This purity is corrupted when a person enters into the world and lives their life on Earth. In order for harmony, peace, and understanding to come about among humanity, a person had to keep their makoto pure.William Theodore De Bary, Carol Gluck, Yoshiko Kurata Dykstra, Arthur E. Tiedemann \\"Sources Of Japanese Tradition, Vol. 2\\" (2005) The concept of makoto originated within the Shinto tradition, and throughout his philosophical writings and lectures, Hosoi draws extensively from Shinto beliefs.Michiko Yamaguchi Aoki, Margaret B. Dardess, \\"As the Japanese see it: past and present\\" (1986) Views on women Hosoi's view of women is similar to most Confucianist of the era, and his views can be said to closely resemble the perspective found in a work entitled Greater Learning For Women,William Theodore De Bary, Carol Gluck, Yoshiko Kurata Dykstra, Arthur E. Tiedemann, \\"Sources of Japanese tradition, Volume 2\\" (2005) which was written by Kaibara Ekken, a famous Confucianist of the Zhu Xi school. According to Hosoi's view, when a woman is in her childhood, the parents should refrain from spoiling her in order to keep her from developing a love of luxury, as well as being unable to adjust to the hardships of the married life. When the woman becomes an adult, she should become married and become a model of endurance, taking on abuse while caring for the mother-in-law and family.Harald Fuess, \\"Divorce in Japan: family, gender, and the state, 1600‚Äì2000\\" (2004) Political Work The politics of the Yonezawa Domain were greatly influenced by Hosoi's teachings, particularly during the reign of Uesugi Y≈çzan, a daimy≈ç who had been tutored by Hosoi since his youth.James Murdoch, \\"A history of Japan, Volume 3\\" (1996) Hosoi lectured Yozan & other students on his conception of Confucian politics, and what proper statescraft was. For Hosoi, the daimy≈ç was seen as a servant of Heaven, and that a faithful servant: The success of the Yonezawa Domain in administration and economic reform was largely seen as a result of Hosoi's influence and Uesugi's dedication and diligence in following plans and ruling by the maxims of \\"To have no waste places in his domain\\" and \\"To have no idlers among his people\\". There was extensive land reclamation, agricultural training for all classes, and the development of a silk & lacquer industry . However, despite the success of the reforms, it is important to note that in Hosoi's political philosophy, loyal service is essential, and part of this loyal service is exalting one's superior. A ruler who was not infallible had to be protected by a virtuous person who was in his service. Hosoi believed that by concealing the ruler's mistakes and decadence, the people would not become corrupt and thus have a moral example that they could admire. As a result of this, Uesugi Yozan is traditionally revered throughout Japanese history as a ruler who was full of virtue and wise. Educator As an educator, Hosoi placed emphasis on the individuality of each student present, and disliked education that involved teaching students collective thought. His beliefs in education can be seen in a letter he wrote to the Lord Of Yonezawa: References Category:1728 births Category:1801 deaths Category:Japanese Confucianists Category:Neo-Confucianism Category:Japanese writers of the Edo period ","title":"Hosoi Heishu"},{"id":"24025298","text":"Frank Monroe Upton (29 April 1896 - 25 June 1962) was a sailor in the United States Navy who received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the First World War.

It applies particularly to soldiers, police officers, bounty hunters, loss prevention, workers who refuse to respect picket lines during a strike and anyone paid a wage who actively facilitates the status quo. According to Barbara Ehrenreich: \\"Class treason is an option at all socioeconomic levels: from the blue-collar man who becomes a security guard employed to harass striking workers, to the heirs of capitalist fortunes who become donors to left-wing causes\\". In Russia before and during the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks and other socialist revolutionary organizations used it to describe the Czarist Army and any working class citizen who directly opposed their notion of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\". The term was later extended to include the Menshevik Russians and other supposedly counter-revolutionary socialist organizations under Joseph Stalin. The motives behind becoming a traitor to one's class can include the necessity of survival (taking up whatever wage is available), the belief that the person is of a higher class and so has political views that work against the working class, the pressure of conformity, or a rejection of the view that society is divided up into antagonistic classes.  Bourgeois class traitors  While the idea of the class traitor is one typically applied to the proletariat, it can also be used to describe members of the upper-class who believe in and espouse socialist ideals. For example, Peter Kropotkin, an anarcho-communist who wrote The Conquest of Bread, was born into a noble family. Additionally, Friedrich Engels, partner and close friend of Karl Marx, the revolutionary socialist and philosopher who with along with Engels founded Marxism, was himself a son of a wealthy factory owner. Such people sacrifice their ability to be part of the capitalist upper-class for the sake of who they see as the oppressed, even if it hurts their status in the process. The Earl of Cardigan was described as a class traitor by The Daily Telegraph for denouncing police violence he had witnessed.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/earl-of-cardigan- seeing-police-beat-a-pregnant-woman-does-poison-your-view-8478415.html  See also  * Angry white male * Class struggle * False consciousness * Race traitor  References  Category:Socialism ","title":"Class traitor"},{"id":"24025371","text":"Opobo/Nkoro is a Local Government Area in Rivers State, Nigeria.

The procedure is known as an aortogram. The diagnosis of aortic dissection can be made by visualization of the intimal flap and flow of contrast material in both the true lumen and the false lumen. The catheter has to be inserted through the right femoral artery, because in about two thirds of cases the aortic dissection spreads into the left common iliac artery. The aortogram was previously considered the gold standard test for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of up to 80% and a specificity of about 94%. It is especially poor in the diagnosis of cases where the dissection is due to hemorrhage within the media without any initiating intimal tear. The advantage of the aortogram in the diagnosis of aortic dissection is that it can delineate the extent of involvement of the aorta and branch vessels and can diagnose aortic insufficiency. The disadvantages of the aortogram are that it is an invasive procedure and it requires the use of iodinated contrast material. Aortography has largely been replaced by the diagnostic tools of MRI, CT, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) all of which have high sensitivities. TEE is favored in emergency situations, as it is relatively non-invasive and a rapid procedure (more so than MRI, which can takes hours).

They lie a few miles north of Oroville in Butte County, California. In the scientific literature, both mesas are also known as North Oroville Table Mountain and South Oroville Table Mountain in order to differentiate them from the Table Mountain, which is also capped by the eroded remnant of a basaltic lava flow, within the Valley Springs 7.5-minute quadrangle in the central foothills of California. They are named for their flat surface, like a table top; because of this it is often mistakenly called Table Top Mountain.

South Table Mountain South Table Mountain, at , is mostly privately owned, and contains the \\"O\\", which is a big \\"O\\" on the side of the plateau, that stands for \\"Oroville\\", the city that it towers over. Dedicated on June 8, 1929 by Oroville High School (OHS) alumni Morrow Steadman, the \\"big O\\" has a concrete thickness of four inches, and was measured by its builders to be 87 feet by 33 feet. It was intended to last through the generations and convey a spirit of good sportsmanship in local high school athletic events. The \\"O\\", and most of its access routes, are located on private property. It was to have another meaning, too, Steadman wrote in the '29 OHS Yearbook the Alpha, saying he hoped the \\"O\\" would remind students of \\"cooperation and teamwork, both on the athletic fields and in our school activities\\". Highway 70 North Table Mountain North Table Mountain, at , is mostly private, but includes a small portion which is a wildlife area, and contains several vernal pools and waterfalls, including Phantom Falls, and Beatson Falls. There are no trails, so people who want to hike to the waterfalls have to find their own way. The best time to view the waterfalls is winter to early spring. They are usually dry during the summer months. Everything east of Cherokee Road in Morris Ravine is on private property and is off limits to visitors unless given specific permission. Lava wall on North Table Mountain. Coal Canyon Coal Canyon, where Phantom Falls is located, gets its name because it looks like coal, but is actually made from basalt. The canyon and waterfall are accessible by a difficult, steep downhill hike, and the canyon itself can also be hiked. Caves The cave at Phantom Falls In addition to dozens of seasonal waterfalls, there are also several shallow caves scattered throughout the basalt canyons. There are about 5 caves located on North Table Mountain, all behind large waterfalls. The largest cave is located at Phantom Falls, and the deepest cave is at Little Phantom Falls, and actually requires crawling. Both are located in Coal Canyon. A small cave is also located at Flag Falls and Beatson Falls. Another cave is located behind a small unnamed waterfall. The caves are made of a mixture of basalt and clay, and were created over thousands of years as the waterfalls eroded away at the rock. The two caves at Coal Canyon are the most easily accessible, and the one at Phantom Falls is the most visited. History Cherokee Cherokee ruins The small ghost town of Cherokee, California, is on the mountain, and is named because a small group of Cherokee Indians were brought there and established a small community. Today only ruins remain, but the area is home to around 20 people. Phantom Ranch Phantom Ranch is the ruins of an ancient ranch house from the late 19th century that was used during the Gold Rush. The ranch can be seen from the Phantom Falls hike. The ranch is now completely in ruins, and the only thing left of it are a few pieces of wood where the foundation used to be. Wildlife Newt on Table Mountain The mountain includes several wildlife species, including: the California newt, banana slugs, different frog species, several bird species, western Pacific rattlesnake, garter snakes, California horned lizard, and several mammal species, including black-tailed deer, coyotes, mountain lion, and domesticated cattle, which move around freely. There is also a small area known as Sugarloaf Mountain, where several animals are said to live, including peacocks, foxes, and wild turkey. Climate and habitat Both the mountains are made up of two main habitats, grassland and forest. The climate is wet and rainy from late autumn to early spring, and hot and dry in the summer. Mining Abandoned mine shaft at Phantom Falls There is a silicon mine at the bottom of North Table Mountain. There are also several old irrigation mines at the north end of North Table Mountain. There is also an old mine shaft at Phantom Falls, which was used during the Gold Rush. Research sometimes takes place at the mine, although it can be difficult. Hydraulic mining near Cherokee produced a large amount of gold before environmental concerns forced an end to it in the late 1800s. Hundreds of good quality diamonds have been found in the area. In film Table Mountain was also used in Terrence Young's movie (which starred O.J. Simpson) The Klansman. The area was used to film scenes that were supposed to take place in Alabama. Clint Eastwood also used this location for parts of his 1976 film The Outlaw Josey Wales, as did director John Leone for the Henry Fonda film The Last of the Cowboys later the same year. Tours Volunteers from the California Department of Fish and Game have now started giving free tours on North Table Mountain. Tours are given the first and third Saturday of the month, Feb-May, when the waterfalls are flowing and flowers are blooming. Tours start from a parking lot on Cherokee road, and there are two tours a day, which last about two hours each. Spring wildflowers Lupine field on Table Mountain Table Mountain is most famous for its vast array of wildflowers, which bloom during spring time. The bloom usually lasts from the last two weeks of March, to the first two weeks of April. The flower bloom is the most popular attraction on Table Mountain. During the time of the bloom, people come from all over Northern California to see the wildflowers, and tourism is at its highest. There are even photo taking tours offered one weekend, but this changes every year. These tours are usually announced in the local paper and news. There are several species of flowers that bloom during this period. The most common are lupine, frying-pan poppy, and goldfields. The flowers are protected by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, so picking them is illegal, but visitors are allowed to look and even touch the flowers, as long they are not damaged. Because the area has few trails, stepping on the flowers may be hard to avoid in some areas. It is advised that visitors are careful while trekking, so the delicate flowers are not damaged. The best flowers are usually found in the area between Fern and Phantom Falls.

A long time doctor (1959‚Äì1996) for the USSR / Russian National Athletics Team, he is best known for developing a concept of \\"weak\\" links in athlete's locomotor system. His patients include hundreds of elite athletes; Olympic, World and European champions in Track & Field and numerous other sports. Some of the well known names are: Sergey Bubka (pole vaulter), Vasiliy Alekseyev (weight lifter), Mikhail Voronin (gymnast), Ludmila Belousova / Oleg Protopopov (pair skating), Ekaterina Maximova / Vladimir Vasiliev (Bolshoi Ballet) Dr. Vorobiev was a founding member of the IAAF Medical Committee and served as a chairman of the Medical Committee of Russian Athletics.  Biography  Dr. Vorobiev was born on December 29, 1929, in Tatarstan, Russia. Early in life, he lost his father in a construction site accident and was raised by his mother. He survived devastating starvation during and post- World War II. He worked through high school to support the family and enrolled in Leningrad Medical Institute in 1947 to study medicine. During his medical studies, he developed an interest in a variety of sports, including basketball. In 1952‚Äì53 he played center on the Soviet Development Basketball Team coached by Alexander Gomelsky. After graduating from medical school in 1953, Dr. Vorobiev started his professional career in the Arkhangelsk Region of Russian North. During that time he enrolled in Leningrad Institute of Physical Education. After receiving his Master of Education degree in 1956, he joined the Moscow region Army Club in 1956 as a sports doctor. In 1959 Dr. Vorobiev was invited to work for the USSR Ministry of Sports. A new position of physician/coach was created to facilitate a more effective preparation of elite athletes. Dr. Vorobiev held this position with the National Athletic Team for 37 years. By the early 1970s the medical staff grew to five full-time physicians and eight massage therapists, with him becoming a Chief Doctor He worked closely with athletes and the coaching staff on the sports techniques and developing specific training programs while being responsible for the overall health of the athletes. He constantly traveled with the team for training sessions and competitions. He headed medical services for the entire Soviet Delegation during 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico, 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid and 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Numerous times he was an IAAF medical delegate for large Athletic events. He received his Ph.D. in the area of foot biomechanics. He was interviewed by New York Times before the 2016 Olympics about Russian doping programs. Dr. Vorobiev denies State sponsored steroid initiatives during his tenure as Head Team Doctor that ended after 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He states that doping use was grass roots in nature, initiated by individual athletes and their coaches. People such as Dr. Sergei Portugalov via his position as head of Biochemical Laboratories of the Ministry of Sports, aided this new black market of performance-enhancing steroids. The promise of results via illicit gains allowed many of those in power to turn their heads. After many years of resisting Sergei Portugalov's efforts to introduce steroid use within the Soviet athletic program, Dr. Vorobiev was fired for alleged cooperation with IAAF for providing the formula for supplement called Phenotropil. Sergei Portugalov linked this act with disqualification Russian race walker medalist in his memo to the Ministry of Sport. The dismissal of Grigory Vorobiev as Head Doctor enabled Portugalov easier access to athletes and coaches that was previously safeguarded by Dr. Vorobiev. Later on the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) suspended Dr Sergei Portugalov for life for supplying athletes with banned substances. Dr. Vorobiev became actively involved in junior and children's sport. He frequently lectured and gave speeches on preventative medicine and high performance training. He consulted individual athletes, sports enthusiasts and patients e.g. Mikhail Youzhny (tennis), Anastasia Volochkova (ballerina). He moved to the United States in 2011 to be close to his son's family. He passed away peacefully at his home in Chicago on November 22, 2019.

The hospital provided many services, including emergency care, critical care, and organ transplantation services.  History  Mercy Hospital was founded in the 1920s. In the 1990s, Mercy Hospital merged with Southern Baptist Hospital, and the two hospitals operated together as Mercy- Baptist Medical Center. The hospital was subsequently acquired by Tenet Healthcare and renamed Lindy Boggs Medical Center in honor of Democratic Congresswoman and Ambassador Lindy Boggs.  Hurricane Katrina  When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, the hospital was at full census. Many employees' and patients' families decided to take shelter at the facility as well, thinking that they would be safer and more comfortable. When the levee system failed, however, many persons found themselves trapped in the facility with no way out. Many patients, especially those recovering from risky organ transplantation procedures, were not able to be given the medicines they needed most and, since both the power and the generators had failed, were without vital services such as mechanical ventilation and cardiac monitoring. A major evacuation effort took place and, thanks to the initiative and hard work of both the hospital staff and the rescue workers, mostly everyone was able to be rescued. Since Hurricane Katrina forced the facility to close, Mid- City New Orleans has been without vital health care services, including an emergency department. The ramp leading to the Emergency Department Entrance as seen in 2007  After Katrina  After the storm, Tenet Healthcare sold the facility to Georgia-based Victory Real Estate Investments. The same real estate group also purchased neighboring properties with plans for a retail development along Bienville Street but the project never moved forward. In 2010, the entire Lindy Boggs complex of buildings and a portion of the surface parking was purchased by St. Margaret's Daughters for $4.2 million. St. Margaret's, a Catholic non-profit organization, spent $37 million to renovate more than 100,000 square feet in a former medical office building on the site. A 112-bed nursing facility named \\"St. Margaret's at Mercy\\" opened in the renovated space in 2013. St. Margaret's originally planned to open a cardiovascular hospital in the remaining portion of the medical center. However, a partnership with the State of Louisiana fell through, which made the project financially unfeasible. Work crews are cleaning asbestos and removing underground storage tanks, with grants from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality paying for the work, according to the report. MCC Real Estate, which has a development agreement for the property at 301 N. Jefferson Davis Parkway, hasn't finalized a renovation plan but is considering an elderly assisted living facility, the report says. In August 2017, work began to clean up the undeveloped portions of the property. A grant from the Environmental Protection Agency paid for asbestos removal and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality paid for removal of underground storage tanks. Workers also pumped stagnant water out of the building, which had been sitting stagnant since Hurricane Katrina. There is currently no plan for the hospital's future use, but the idea of an assisted living facility for patients with memory care needs has been discussed.

She received a merit-based full scholarship from the Ministry of Culture that allowed her to study the five-year program in interior design and wood technologies at the Technical University in Zvolen, Czechoslovakia (today in Slovakia). After graduation, Leokadia married Ji≈ô√≠ ƒåerm√°k and moved to Ostrov a town not far from Karlovy Vary. She worked in Karlovy Vary first as an interior and furniture designer and later, as a teacher at a technical high school. Education Leokadia Makarska-ƒåerm√°k (as Leokadia ƒåerm√°kov√°) received her Bachelor of Arts with Cum Laude honors from the Bernard M. Baruch College of the City University of New York in the United States, her master's degree from the Thomas G. Masaryk College of the Czech Technical University (CVUT) in Prague, and her master's degree in Architecture of Interiors and Furniture design from Technical University in Zvolen in former Czechoslovakia. Career Beginnings Since the early 1980s, Makarska-ƒåerm√°k belonged to local fine art club and exhibited her art in Ostrov and Karlovy Vary. However, in 1995 she decided to concentrate on her art work full-time and left her teaching position. It was in these years that Makarska-ƒåerm√°k studied painting and drawing under the direction of professor Hana in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic), professors Francesco Brunetti, Demetrio Casile and Nino Noce in Italy, and Jacek M. Rybczynski in Germany. In October 1997, Makarska-ƒåerm√°k had her first exhibit in the United States. It was hosted by the Polish Consulate General in New York. Since 1998, Makarska-ƒåerm√°k has been working at the Grand Prospect Hall as an in-house artist and curator, restoring paintings and interiors. Honors Cermak's list of honors includes presentation of portraits to such public figures as NYC Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, and Founder and Executive Director of CIAO Mary C. Sansone. ART BUSINESS NEWS, Gallery Section, January 2008  Critical Acclaim  Professor Jacek Maria Rybczynski wrote in Mainz, Germany, in 1996 a critical analysis on Leokadia Makarska-Cermak's unique art: The paintings of Makarska-Cermak provoke and invite a deeply individual interpretation and experience of the colorful world of Nature. [Her artwork] branch out in two streams: one emotive, the other documentary. [In] The emotive stream [‚Ä¶] is best exemplified in the \\"flower portrait\\" series; here we meet with lifelong companions incorporated in fantastic flora-motifs. Makarska-Cermak's self-avowed fascination with nature's beauty is coated with a layer of symbolism: the flower as the mystical center conveys mystery and discloses at once a perplexing enigma and the logic of events...for the flower alludes to the passage of time, the cycle of birth and demise. In the documentary stream, the artist explores the classical approach to portrait rendition, aptly depicting the personalities and psyches of her posers.\\" Elinor Stecker-Orel, Editor to The New York Times wrote about Leokadia Makarska-Cermak's artwork on October 27, 1998: \\"The viewer is immediately struck by the power of [Leokadia Makarska-Cermak's] work, power that is manifested in her bold colors and forceful brushstrokes. Remarkably, Makarska- Cermak is able to integrate this approach with subjects that ordinarily would be rendered with a more delicate hand. The result is work that is both emotional and sensitive. The United States certainly is the beneficiary in having this talented artist on our shores.\\" On November 12, 1998 Rafal Olbinski, painter, graphic and designer noted that: As a member of the faculty of the School of Visual Arts for over a decade, I have had the privilege to observe and evaluate hundreds of portfolios and I have been fortunate to encounter many very talented people. Leokadia Makarska-Cermak is one such artist, who displays depth, consistency, maturity and focus. She eloquently integrates her remarkable sensitivity to the subject in the portraits, capturing the personality and the spirit of the person. In both the portraits as well as the floral compositions, Ms. Cermak displays a strong technique, skill and boundless feminine intuition. Her ambition, dedication and prolificness is the evident driving force in her work, which exemplifies and reveals rich and diverse artistic abilities.\\" Media coverage *Leokadia Makarska-ƒåerm√°k's work has been featured in newspaper and magazine articles as well as in radio and television programs.

Generally speaking, there is no difficulty in building an adequate receiving antenna; the challenge is designing an antenna which can be used for transmission without an adjustable impedance matching network. An ideal ‚Äúbroadband‚Äù shortwave antenna would work continuously across much of, if not all of, the shortwave spectrum with good radiation efficiency and minimal compromise of the radiation pattern. Most practical broadband antennas compromise on one of the above: Either they only work on a few relatively narrow slices of the HF radio spectrum, or they work across the complete spectrum, without gaps, but are inefficient radiators on some or all of the frequencies. Other antennas provide adequate efficiency on some frequencies, but require a separate antenna tuner to function on others. A few designs remain omnidirectional on all frequencies but most ‚Äúbeam‚Äù antennas lose their directionality. Background At the lower shortwave frequencies e.g. 1.8 MHz, the antennas need to be physically large to enable good coupling to \\"space\\" and hence efficient radiation. As an example, at 5 MHz a half wave dipole antenna is around 27 meters long (90 ft.), at 3.5 MHz nearly 41 meters (133 ft.), and 2 MHz it is 71 meters long (234 ft.). Half-wave horizontal dipoles are efficient radiators, if they are about half their length above ground or higher; if low to the ground relative to wavelength then horizontal dipoles suffer from large loss of signal in the earth and are inefficient radiators. Half wave dipoles are narrow band (only work over a very small frequency range) before serious impedance mismatch occurs. This mismatch can be accommodated using an antenna tuner but these add to costs and modern shortwave communication often uses frequency hopping techniques. Even automatic antenna tuners will not work with frequency hopping signals. A less ambitious idea of ‚Äúbroadband antenna‚Äù is an that one continuously covers the widest amateur band, that spans 3.5 MHz‚Äì4.0 MHz (a 14% bandwidth),In this sense, ‚Äúwidest‚Äù means the largest ratio of high to low frequency, not the frequency difference. without requiring an antenna tuner. There are many such designs, but those are not discussed here. Broadband shortwave base antennas traditionally fall into two main categories: * Resistively loaded antennas which can be inexpensive and reasonably compact but inefficient at lower frequencies. * Large elaborate and very expensive, non-loaded designs. (These can cost upward of $80,000 to purchase and install). Many \\"broadband\\" designs used by the amateur radio enthusiasts are generally not true broadband antennas as they only transmit well (without an antenna tuner) in the harmonically related Amateur bands. The challenge for many years has been to devise an antenna which is an efficient radiator, compact, and also inexpensive. Previous solutions include the Barker Williamson folded dipole, the Australian traveling-wave antenna and other designs by Guertler etc. Some shortwave broadband antennas can even be used on the whole shortwave radio spectrum (1.6‚Äì30 MHz) which consist of the upper part of medium frequency (1.6‚Äì3 MHz) and the whole of high frequency (3‚Äì30 MHz).  Examples  * T2FD antenna ‚Äì its all-around performance, relatively modest size, low cost, and the fact that it does not require any complex electronic matching to operate with a standard shortwave transmitter, have made it popular in professional shortwave communications. * Log-periodic antenna ‚Äì The log periodic is commonly used in high power short wave broadcasting where it is desired to invest in only a single antenna to cover transmissions over multiple bands. It is the only type of directional antenna that maintains directionality over its entire working range. * Discone antenna ‚Äì Omnidirectional, vertically polarized and with gain similar to a dipole, it is exceptionally wideband, offering a frequency range ratio of up to approximately 10:1. * Traveling-wave antenna ‚Äì An advantage of traveling wave antennas is that since they are nonresonant they often have a wider bandwidth than resonant antennas. * Terminated Coaxial Cage Monopole (TC2M) ‚Äì a vertical polarized broadband shortwave antenna. The antenna can be characterized by being a vertical traveling-wave coaxially caged monopole over a ground plane. * Off-center fed dipole antennas ‚Äì also called ‚ÄúWindom‚Äù antennas ‚Äì By carefully selecting the position of a feedpoint about of the way from the end of a half-wavelength wire, its feedpoint impedance is nearly constant for a variety of nearly- harmonic frequencies of the half-wave frequency. All Windom-style antennas have wide coverage gaps inbetween their nearly-harmonic working bands. Varying the position and length of the antenna, and adding loading stubs near its center can alter the sequence of feasible frequencies, and add more frequencies to the list. Among the off-center-fed designs are the ‚ÄúCarolina Windom‚Äù, which deliberately uses radiation from its feedline, K5GP antenna, ON4AA antenna (six bands). * Robinson-Barnes antenna ‚Äì A restively terminated antenna designed and developed in the early 1990s by Graham RobinsonGraham Robinson was the founder of , located in Perth Western Australia. The \\"RB\\" Travelling Wave Antenna is popular for use by Governments, UN, Military, NGOs, and is marketed in various configurations as a BBA-100. and John Barnes and has become a widely used design for commercial and military shortwave base- stations, where ground space is limited, yet a 4 octave bandwidth (2‚Äì30 MHz) is required. It is a center-fed wire antenna with two arms, each consisting of three radiating elements and is generally tower mounted, either horizontally or as an \\"inverted V\\".

It was an all-weather temporary field built by the XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed it was turned over for use by the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force 47th Bombardment Group from 9‚Äì20 August 1943, flying A-20 Havoc light bombers.

On February 23, 1892, the 19-year-old Mitchell cut the throat of Ward, then 17 years old. Mitchell was subsequently found insane by means of a jury inquisition and placed in a psychiatric hospital until her death in 1898. The case, which was exploited by sensationalist press, focused attention on the sexual attachments of women and drew out discussions of lesbianism into the public discourse. The case was headlined as \\"A Very Unnatural Crime\\" across the country.The Trials of Alice Mitchell: Sensationalism, Sexology, and the Lesbian Subject\\" by Lisa Duggan The case influenced the popular literature of the era which began to depict lesbians as \\"murderous\\" and \\"masculine\\". One identity that came to be thought lesbians was the \\"mannish lesbian\\" creating dialogue of gender expression. The case history produced by Mitchell's defense describes her as \\"a regular tomboy\\". In the courtroom Alice Mitchell was presented as \\"insane\\" by her attorneys and her trial was not tried in criminal court but for questioning of lunacy. This story was featured on Investigation Discovery's Deadly Women. Mitchell's story is the subject of the book Alice + Freda Forever by Alexis Coe, which is being adapted into a film directed by Jennifer Kent, and scheduled for release in 2020.  Early life  Alice Mitchell was born in 1872 to George and Isabella MitchellCoe, Alexis (January 1, 2014). Alice + Freda Forever: A Murder in Memphis. San Francisco: Zest Books. Alice was never interested in the toys that young girls were interested in. She was interested in playing on the swing in her yard, and playing both baseball and football. Alice had four siblings: her older brothers Robert and Frank, her eldest sister Mattie and her older sister Addie. She was closest with her brother Frank. Together, they played with marbles and practiced shooting with a rifle. Alice also liked horses and helped take care of her father's horse. Her mother tried to teach her sewing and needlework, but Alice never enjoyed doing this work nor was ever able to learn how. Alice was not interested in boys as a child as most girls her age were. In fact, as she grew older, she was sometimes rude to young men.  Relationship with Freda Ward  An earlier crayon portrait of Frederica Ward. From the Appeal Avalancche Newspaper, Memphis, TN. Alice and Freda met at the Higbee School for Young Ladies. They were very open about their relationship: they kissed, hugged, and held hands. This was not considered as homosexual behavior during this period and intimate female friendships were called \\"chumming\\" in Memphis. However, their relationship was more serious than \\"chumming\\" and Alice especially had an obsession with Freda. Freda's family left Memphis and moved upriver to Golddust, Tennessee. Because Alice and Freda did not live in the same city, they only saw each other occasionally. However, when one of them would make the trip to see the other, they would stay together for weeks at a time. When visiting, the two would share a bed at night. Freda was not as serious about the relationship as Alice was and was interested in two men in addition to Alice. The two dated until Freda's eldest sister and surrogate mother Ada Volkmar forbade Freda to communicate with Alice.  Depression  Alice had devised a scheme in which she would begin dressing as a man, marry Freda and both would go to live in St. Louis as husband and wife with Alice (as Alvin J. Ward) finding work to support Freda. Freda accepted this proposal. Ada Volkmar discovered their letters, including the proposal, and sent a letter to Alice and to Alice's mother Isabella telling Alice to stay away from Freda. Because their relationship was exposed and they were not allowed to see each other, Alice fell into a deep depression. She was rarely with her family, would stay awake at night, and ate very little. Alice would spend her time remembering her relationship with Freda: she would observe her photograph of Freda and reread letters. Alice often signed receipts with the name \\"Freda Ward\\" and claimed that she did not realize what she was doing.  Murder of Freda Ward  Freda Ward was with her older sister Jo Ward and her friend Christina Purnell in Memphis when Alice slashed Freda with George Mitchell's razor. Freda, Jo, and Christina were heading towards the river to board the steamboat Ora Lee to head to Golddust. After following them in a wagon, driven by her friend Lillie Johnson, Alice saw Freda and walked over to her on thawing ice. Alice took her father's razor from her pocket and slashed Freda across her face. Jo tried to protect Freda by attacking Alice with an umbrella, but the attack was not successful. Angered by the umbrella, Alice sliced Jo's collarbone. Freda, bleeding and disoriented, was finally killed by Alice with a deep slice across her throat. After killing Freda, Alice went back to the wagon and told Lillie Johnson what she had done. Lillie decided to take her home instead of to the police. Later both she and Alice were arrested. Lillie was released on bond but Alice had to remain in jail. Alice was tried that summer and declared \\"presently insane\\" meaning that she was insane before the murder. According to her own testimony, Alice killed Freda because if they could not get married then there was no reason for either of them to live and no one should marry Freda if she could not. All charges were dropped against Lillie Johnson and Alice was ordered to Western State Hospital for the Insane located at Bolivar, Tennessee. She died there in 1898.

Plot A Moscow freelance journalist named Valentin Saphonov finds an ad on a pole from the Stellar Time Agency, inviting people to sign up to become a pilot of a space fighter. Assuming this is an ad for a computer game, Valentin goes to the address specified in the ad and is greeted by an attractive woman named Inna. She warns him that everything he is about to do is for real. She explains that, upon his agreement, a copy of Valentin's body and consciousness will be created on a remote space station, where he will receive a spaceship and will be involved in a fight against aliens. After walking him through several rooms, Inna sends Valentin through the back door of the office, explaining that his alter ego is already on the station. Valentin, believing all this to be a prank, decides to conduct an investigation of Stellar Time. He soon finds the gaming website for the popular Russian MMORPG StarQuake. He registers under the nickname Katran ( ‚Äî \\"spiny dogfish\\"), unaware that his alter ego has received exactly the same nickname. Eventually, Valentin realizes that his character lives his own life and that all this may be actually happening. Valentin's double quickly ends up being kidnapped by the Seekers, a sect of people who believe that all they are experiencing is a computer simulation, just like in the Matrix. Valentin (AKA Katran) and his instructor Lena (AKA Driver) end up on the icy planet Nigredo, where all water (in every form) is black-colored but normal otherwise. The planet contains the hidden base of the Seekers. Master reveals that they have managed to obtain the plans for building an ultimate WMD ‚Äî a weapon capable of extinguishing a star in a matter of minutes. They plan to use the Extinguisher to force those who have sent them into space to either unplug them (if everything is indeed a simulation) or return them home. After purchasing a new ship from Roman, Valentin and Lena go back to the Platform, where they have to face a tribunal-like hearing (albeit much less formal). During the hearing, a massive fleet of aliens known as the \\"Bugs\\" attacks the Platform, and every pilot is mobilized to defend the station. Many pilots are lost in the battle, but they manage to destroy most of the enemy ships and force the rest to retreat. Meanwhile, on Earth, the original Valentin realizes that something strange is happening with his in-game character and decides to investigate further. He contacts Lena via ICQ and invites her over to discuss in-game events. However, he quickly realizes that someone is trying to prevent their meeting from occurring. Lena arrives to his apartment, where she confirms his suspicions that everything they have been told at the agency is true ‚Äî there really are copies of them somewhere out there, flying spaceships and fighting. Valentin receives a call on a phone which he turned off the day before, where an unknown person threatens him to drop his investigation and just play the game. The unknown person turns out to be a sniper on a neighboring roof. Valentin and Lena barely manage to escape in her car. They drive to Oleg, an acquaintance of Valentin, who is intrigued by their story. At Oleg's apartment, Valentin decides that they must contact their doubles and get them to return to Earth in their ships to threaten the agency. He takes a screenshot of the game's 2D star map and sends it to a local astronomer. Surprisingly, the astronomer fairly quickly manages to determine the location of the Sun on the game's map. Lena logs into the game as her other character (whose ship is operated by a bot in space). In space, Valentin and Lena are tasked by the administration to fly to a faraway planet, which has an abundant supply of certain rare elements needed by the Seekers to complete the Extinguisher. It is there that Valentin receives a message from his other self. The message explains how to find the Sun on their star map (about 330 parsecs away). They realize too late that the Seekers have tricked them and have made off with a substantial amount of the necessary elements, giving them all they need to build the weapon. They return to the Platform, where Valentin decides to share the information about the location of the Sun with Vadim Reshetov, an administrator, only to be knocked out and imprisoned by him. On Earth, in the middle of the night, Valentin and Lena decide to go to the agency and demand answers. They arrive to find two dead bodies (the agency's security guard and a young Jewish boy), who seem to have shot each other. They find the original Inna and Reshetov there and force them to explain everything. Apparently, Reshetov was approached by a shapeshifting alien several years ago who offered to trade alien technology in return for Reshetov's agency sending people into space. Reshetov considers himself to be a businessman and a patriot, as he wishes to use the new technology to help Russia. He does not know the identity or motives of his mysterious benefactors, and their emissary (the security guard) is now dead. He offers Valentin and Lena positions at his agency, and they accept, realizing that there is little they can do. They resolve to try to convince every visitor to leave, but their attempts are revealed to be futile, as people yearn for this sort of adventure. On the station, the other Reshetov receives a message from the original and makes a similar offer to the duplicate Valentin and Lena. However, Platform sensors then detect the Seeker fleet close to the system's star. Reshetov sends Valentin and Lena as negotiators, as they know some of the Seekers personally. After docking with the Seekers' flagship, they once again meet Roman and Master. However, Valentin then realizes that their ships have likely been rigged to explode by Reshetov in an attempt to stop the Seekers. The bomb on Valentin's ship is thrown into space, while a Seeker takes Lena's ship far from the fleet and sacrifices himself to save the others. After finding out the location of Earth, the Seekers decide to undertake the long journey home. However, at their first stop, they are ambushed by an enormous \\"Bug\\" fleet. Roman orders everyone to follow him, as he sets course straight for the system's star (a blue supergiant later revealed to be Rigel). As they get closer, being chased by the \\"Bugs\\", Roman launches the Extinguisher missile, which explodes in the upper photosphere. The weapon creates an enormous shockwave which destroys the alien fleet, at the same time leaving a small tunnel at the epicenter, allowing the Seekers to pass through the exploding star. They jump to the next system, only to find a massive \\"Bug\\" ship waiting for them. Instead of attacking, the aliens send a message to the fleet, revealing their agenda for sending people into space and attacking the Platform every so often. Apparently, they use the humans to fight their offspring to weed out those with genetic weaknesses, as only the strongest would survive. This is a form of population control. That is why they have built the station and made a deal with Reshetov (and, possibly, others). They explain that nobody is forcing humans to go into space ‚Äî they make this choice freely, as the agency employees are supposed to explain the situation truthfully. The reason for human infertility is simple ‚Äî the \\"Bugs\\" believe it would be cruel to allow humans to bring children into an environment where they are constantly threatened. The \\"Bugs\\" make it clear that the Seekers (or anyone else, for that matter) should not attempt to reach Earth using ships, under the pain of death. The Seekers realize that they have no choice and decide to go back to the Platform. Valentin and Lena follow them, hoping that humanity may one day rival the \\"Bugs\\". Characters * Valentin Saphonov (AKA \\"Katran\\"): the protagonist of the novel. He is 35, single, no children. Works as a freelance journalist. Does not have a steady job, as good newspapers/magazines do not want to hire him, and he has too much self-respect to work for the bad ones. A brave man, capable of coming up with unexpected solutions to problems. * Lena (AKA \\"Driver\\"): member of the Silent Star Clan and an instructor for newbie pilots on the station. In her early 30s, single, no children. On Earth, works as a taxi driver (hence the nickname) due to her love for automobiles. Earlier attempted to blackmail the Stellar Time Agency, which caused the agency to actively prevent Lena and Valentin from meeting. * Inna: employee of the Stellar Time Agency, whose job is to send all who are willing to the Platform. Her duplicate in space is an administrator of the Platform, whose task is to greet new arrivals and allocate them initial funds and quarters. She was the first human to arrive on the station. * Vadim Reshetov: the head of the Platform administration, whose word is the law. Capable of betraying those who trust him. He is 42 years old, divorced, and has a grown daughter. Reshetov is a former KGB operative. His duplicate on Earth is the founder of the Stellar Time Agency. He was the second human to arrive to the station. * Boris (AKA \\"Pale Fox\\"): employee of the Stellar Time Agency. In space, he takes care of various \\"delicate\\" assignments of the administration. On Earth, he is used by Reshetov to hold patents on technology received from aliens. * Bogomolov: emissary of the Bugs on Earth. Keeps an eye on Stellar Time as a security guard. His last name hints at his insectoid origins (\\"bogomol\\" is Russian for \\"praying mantis\\"). * Oleg Begunov (AKA \\"Runner\\"): system administrator for a local newspaper. He is 25 years old, single, no children. Breaks the traditional nerd stereotype by being in excellent physical condition and liking sports, art, and adventure. While he is a StarQuake player, he never visited the Stellar Time Agency, so his ship in space is flown by a bot. * Leonid Levinson: a young boy from a nice Jewish family. Decided to look for adventure after an argument with his mother. Ended up on the Platform with his violin. Since entertainers are rare out there, he was forbidden to become a pilot and forced to play in a local bar. The original Levinson attacks the Stellar Time headquarters and sacrifices himself to kill Bogomolov. * Roman: member of the Seekers, a clan which believes that they are not really in space but in a Matrix-like computer simulation. While he looks like a heavyweight boxer, Roman has a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence. * Zinovy Piluchenko (AKA \\"Master\\"): head of the Seekers. He is 38 years old. The world of the novel The events of the novel take place simultaneously within the universe of StarQuake and in modern-day Moscow. Most of the characters are people who answered the ad and visited the Stellar Time Agency. Those who agreed to be duplicated will have their copies live in outer space. If the duplicate survives for three years, his or her memories will be copied into the mind of the original. The duplicate's finances will also be transferred to the original and converted to the appropriate currency. Until then, the one who remains on Earth can register on the game website and follow his duplicate from the viewpoint of his character. The duplicate finds himself on the main space station named the Platform (or the Bun due to its shape). He is given 1,500 starting credits, for which he can buy a primitive ship and perform various tasks, including asteroid mining, interstellar trade and transportation, fulfilling tasks (i.e., quests) assigned by the administration or other players, and exploring remote star systems. While earning credits and gaining experience, the player can raise his level and purchase a new ship. The pilot of a more powerful ship can become a space pirate or join the ranks of the volunteer patrol service. Also, the player can join one of the many clans, which are constantly engaged in struggles with each other for resource-rich planets and star systems. Besides being a pilot, the duplicate can also choose another profession either on the Platform or on a colony. The most valuable professions are engineers and scientists, who can study unknown technology for human use. Technicians are also valuable, as they repair and maintain the pilots' ships. All known planets in the vicinity of the Platform contain only plant life. Some planets also contain fossils of long-dead animals. It is assumed that they died out due to infertility approximately 1,000 years ago. None of the women who have arrived to the Platform are able to conceive children. The cause for this is unknown. Food, clothing, and various devices are created using the so-called \\"synthesizers\\", machines capable of flawlessly replicating physical objects based on a built-in program. The synthesizing process consumes matter and energy. It is necessary that the source matter contain all the necessary elements for an object to be reproduces (i.e., synthesizers cannot transmutate matter). For example, a synthesizer will be unable to create an object made of iron if the source material only contains carbon. Ship-producing synthesizers are only present on the Platform. Occasionally, a highly advanced alien race nicknamed the \\"Bugs\\" attacks the human colonies and the Platform.

The second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Bill originated from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic on August 15\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, the cyclone intensified within a favorable atmospheric environment, becoming Tropical Storm Bill six hours after formation. Steered west-northwest around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the northeast of the cyclone, Bill passed through the central Atlantic. At 0600 UTC on August 17, the cyclone strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale; within 36 hours, Bill entered a period of rapid deepening and intensified into a major hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Passing well northeast of the Lesser Antilles, Bill attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 943 mb (hPa; 27.85 inHg) on August 19 and August 20, respectively. Thereafter, an approaching trough induced higher vertical wind shear across the region, causing slow weakening of the hurricane; this same trough resulted in an accelerated motion and curve northward. As the storm passed Bermuda, it contained sustained winds equal to a Category 2, and ultimately struck Newfoundland as a tropical storm. After moving inland and weakening to a tropical storm, Bill began an extratropical transition; this alteration in structure was completed by 1200 UTC on August 24\\\\. Two days later, Bill's remnant low was absorbed into a larger extratropical system over the Northern Atlantic. Bill caused $46.2 million in damages and two deaths over a nine-day period. As it passed close to Bermuda, the hurricane caused power outages and strong winds, though damage was minor. Despite remaining well offshore of the United States East Coast, the storm's large wind field contributed to strong surf which caused severe beach erosion. Numerous offshore rescue operations occurred as a result of people swept away by the strong waves. All two deaths caused by the hurricane were the result of drownings off the U.S. coast. In some areas of New England, the storm's outer rainbands caused flash flooding. In Atlantic Canada, Bill caused mainly power outages and flooding events. Several roads were flooded in Nova Scotia, and 32,000 people lost power. In Newfoundland, where the hurricane made landfall, strong winds caused minor tree damage. As an extratropical system, Bill dropped light rainfall in the British Isles and Scandinavia. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 12, 2009, and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked upon the possibility for tropical cyclone development, as the wave had already been accompanied by a broad area of shower and thunderstorm activity. The wave quickly organized, and a low pressure system formed to the south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 13. The convection became slightly less organized on August 14, though by early August 15, the NHC reported that a tropical depression was forming. The system was declared Tropical Depression Three later that day. The newly designated depression continued to intensify, and it was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Bill. Numerous rainbands had begun to develop, though the storm lacked deep convection near its center. At this time, Bill was already predicted to become a hurricane. By early on August 16, the storm had developed what NHC forecasters described as a \\"beautiful\\" cloud pattern, and environmental conditions favored continued strengthening. Bill intensified to attain Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale early on August 17. By late August 17, satellite imagery indicated that an eye feature may have been developing. Bill sustained deep convection and well-established upper-level outflow; it was upgraded to Category 2 status shortly before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. Early August 18, the storm had established a very symmetric and well- organized appearance on satellite imagery, and a large, pronounced eye. The storm was moving west-northwestward under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge to the north. Information derived from Hurricane Hunter reports and satellite imagery indicated that the storm had strengthened and reached Category 3 intensity on August 18, making it a major hurricane. Despite some wind shear, Bill was upgraded further to Category 4 intensity on August 19 and reached maximum size with hurricane-force winds extending and tropical storm force winds extending from the center On August 20, the storm began to weaken, being downgraded to a Category 3, as convection associated with it diminished somewhat. The storm's eyewall also weakened, with a portion of it dissipating later that day. Shear also deteriorated the structure of the storm, with clouds being displaced from the main circulation. However, shortly after, the eye became much better defined and developed several mesovortices, a feature typical of intense hurricanes. On August 21, Bill was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane as the structure of the storm deteriorated; however, the atmospheric pressure in the eye was 954 mbar (hPa) at that time, equivalent to a strong Category 3 storm. By the morning of August 22, the hurricane completed an eyewall replacement cycle and featured a wide eye. Later on August 22, the storm weakened to a Category 1 hurricane as Bill tracked over cooler waters. The storm maintained its intensity through August 23 as it retained its cloud-filled eye and tracked at a quick pace to the north-northeast producing waves at La Have Bank Buoy (station 44142) and 16 ft surge on coastlines in New England and Nova Scotia. The storm then made landfall shortly before midnight local time, at Point Rosie, on the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland as 70 mph (110 km/h) tropical storm. Shortly after this it was downgraded to a tropical storm, and then lost tropical characteristics. The remnants of Bill crossed the Atlantic Ocean as an extratropical storm and later impacted the United Kingdom with heavy rain and surf. On August 26, the remnants of Hurricane Bill were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone, near the British Isles. Preparations Bermuda Hurricane Bill nearing Bermuda on August 21 On August 18, the Emergency Measures Organisation (EMO) of Bermuda advised the public to begin preparing for Hurricane Bill. Derrick Binns, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Labour, Home Affairs and Housing, reported that \\"We have been following the storm closely since its inception, and today we reviewed our planning and procedures to ensure all are in sync. While we have not as yet issued hurricane warnings, I think it is important to advise residents to check their emergency kits to be sure supplies are adequate.\\" Residents on the island were instructed to review their emergency supplies, while boat owners were urged to secure their watercrafts. By August 20, preparations had expanded as the projected path of Bill was to pass 200 miles west-southwest of the British overseas territory early on August 22. Late on August 21, The Causeway bridge linking the eastern parish of St. Georges was closed as well as L.F. Wade International Airport. Ferry service was cancelled until August 23. Late on August 21, tropical storm force winds were observed in Bermuda with some gusts above hurricane force. United States In response to predictions of rough surf and rip currents, the Atlantic Beach, North Carolina fire department planned to increase the number of on-duty lifeguards. On Long Island, New York, local officials began tracking Hurricane Bill and initiating preparations. Local crew workers trimmed trees to reduce the amount of airborne debris. On August 17, the United States Army assessed 30 key buildings for power needs. Residents were urged to stock up on food and emergency supplies as officials estimated that in the event of a hurricane emergency, nearly 650,000 people would not have access to shelter. The Suffolk County Red Cross began organizing catering agencies to prepare meals to supply shelters. The Long Island Power Authority also took preventative measures. On August 20, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency made several conference calls with the National Weather Service about possible impacts from the storm in the state, particularly in Cape Cod. Bill came close enough to the region to warrant a tropical storm warning for a while. Canada Hurricane Bill over Newfoundland on August 24 Peter Bowyer, Program Supervisor of the Canadian Hurricane Centre, advised Nova Scotia residents to monitor the storm's progress and take necessary precautions. He said it is \\"almost inevitable that the storm will find some part of Eastern Canada. Whether that‚Äôs the marine areas or the land district, it's still too far to say.\\" Dozens of flights were canceled ahead of the storm at Halifax Stanfield International Airport and ferry service between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was temporarily canceled. Offshore, the Exxon Mobil corporation evacuated nearly 200 personnel from a project near Nova Scotia as a precaution. On August 22, officials announced that all parks in Nova Scotia would be closed for the duration of Hurricane Bill. On August 22, Environment Canada, the meteorological agency of Canada, issued a tropical storm warning from Charlesville in Shelburne County, Nova Scotia eastward to Ecum Secum in the Halifax Regional Municipality. A hurricane watch was issued for areas between Ecum Secum eastward to Point Aconi. The remaining north coast of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and western Newfoundland were placed under a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the tropical storm warning was extended to include the areas under a hurricane watch and most of Newfoundland was placed under a tropical storm watch. Early on August 23, a tropical storm warning was issued in Newfoundland for areas between Stone's Cove and Cape Bonavista. About 150 people were evacuated from two senior homes in Newfoundland and the town of Placentia was put under a state of emergency in fears of storm surge damage. Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom On August 25, Met √âireann issued gale warnings across the south of Ireland, and advised small boats not to go out to sea until the system had passed. They also forecast up to of rain across Ireland. The Met Office in the UK issued severe weather warnings in preparation for the arrival of the storm. Impact On August 19, Peter Bray, a British rower attempting to break the record for the quickest solo crossing of the Atlantic was forced to abandon his boat and board the RRS James Cook due to being in the path of Hurricane Bill. Large, life-threatening swells produced by the storm impacted north-facing coastlines of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola as Hurricane Bill approached Bermuda. United States Hurricane Bill off the east coast of the United States on August 22 In Massachusetts, outer bands of Hurricane Bill produced significant amounts of rainfall, peaking at in Kingston, Massachusetts. Most areas along the eastern portion of the state received rain during the night of August 22 into the morning of August 23, with several areas exceeding . On Long Island, beach damage was severe; in some areas the damage was the worst since Hurricane Gloria in 1985. Along the coasts of North Carolina, waves averaging in height impacted beaches. In Wrightsville Beach, up to 30 rescues were made due to strong rip currents and large swells; however, only one incident resulted in hospitalization. Severe beach erosion took place at Bald Head Island, where of beach was washed away, resulting in the loss of the remaining sea turtle nests. Along the coastlines of Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, waves were estimated to have reached at the height of the event. Beaches along the Georgia coastline, located nearly 600 mi (970 km) from Bill, recorded large swells from the storm and strong rip currents. In Delaware, waves peaked near , resulting in one serious injury after a man was tossed by a wave and thrown face-first into the sand. Waves from Hurricane Bill along the New Jersey coast Waves along the Georgia coast averaged in height with some reaching . This resulted in numerous lifeguard rescues and some minor coastal flooding. Beaches along Long Island were closed after waves up to began to cause coastal flooding and beach erosion. All beaches around New York City were closed due to the risk of strong rip currents and waves up to . In southern New York, a cold front stalled by Hurricane Bill produced torrential rainfall, amounting to at least in a few hours, causing flash flooding and a tornado in Maine. Lightning produced by severe thunderstorms also left 5,000 residences without power. A 54-year-old man drowned at New Smyrna Beach, Volusia County, Florida due to the heavy surf. In New York, severe beach erosion caused by the storm resulted in over $35.5 million in losses. A 7-year-old girl drowned after she, her father, and a 12-year-old girl were swept off a rocky ledge near Acadia National Park in Maine on August 23. The three were part of an early afternoon crowd of thousands who lined the Maine's national park's rocky shoreline to watch the high surf and crashing waves. Authorities said that about 20 people were swept away, but 17 of them made back to shore safely. Eleven were sent to area hospitals for spinal cord injuries. Two lifeguards at Mecox Beach in Watermill, New York accompanied endurance artist David Blaine back to shore after he was allegedly caught in a rip current after ignoring signs and verbal warnings not to swim in the ocean on August 23\\\\. Blaine said he was not in trouble and did not need the rescue. Further inland, a band of heavy rain fueled by tropical moisture from Bill produced upwards of in southern New Hampshire during an eight-hour span. The intense rainfall led to significant flash flooding that covered several roads and inundated homes. Mudslides also closed roads in portions of the state as hillsides collapsed. Seven people required water rescue after their cars stalled in floodwaters. Overall, the floods left roughly $700,000 in damages in New Hampshire but no fatalities or injuries. Bermuda and Atlantic Canada Rainfall from Hurricane Bill The hurricane had little impact in Bermuda. A public high school was designated as an emergency shelter, into which The Salvation Army took six homeless people. Some 3,700 households experienced power outages at some point during the storm, and in some instances cable television and internet services were also interrupted, particularly in the central Spanish Point headland. During the daytime on Saturday, public works crews performed cleanup of light debris, mostly discarded garbage unveiled by the storm. By the afternoon of August 23, up to of rain had fallen in southern Nova Scotia. At least 32,000 residences in Nova Scotia had lost power due to the storm. At the height of the storm, 45,000 people were without power and rainfall rates reached 1.2 in/h (30 mm/h). Several roads were flooded and overall damage was considered minor. Three people were injured by large waves and a gift shop and a home were badly damaged while a fish shed and breakwater were destroyed at Peggys Cove after being washed away by a wave.\\"Hurricane Bill Weakens in Newfoundland\\" CBC Radio August 24, 2009 Offshore, a buoy measured waves up to . Winds in Nova Scotia were recorded up to 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. In Newfoundland, the Avalon Peninsula experienced the highest winds from Hurricane Bill. A wind gust of was recorded in Cape Race. In St. John's, trees were blown down by the strong winds. However, rains from Bill mostly affected central areas of the island, where rainfall peaked at in Gander. Rains washed out roads, and was responsible for some localized freshwater flooding. Other areas of the central and southern coasts also received rain. Damage from the storm throughout Atlantic Canada reached $10 million. British Isles and Scandinavia Throughout the British Isles, the remnants of Bill produced high winds and heavy rains. All of Ireland and most of the United Kingdom was affected by the storm in some way. Rainfall in the United Kingdom peaked at in Shap. After passing through the British Isles, the remnant system affected parts of Scandinavia before dissipating.

Seamands (February 6, 1922 ‚Äì July 29, 2006), author, scholar, and evangelical renewal movement leader within the United Methodist Church, was born in India to Methodist missionary parents and spent much of his boyhood there. He graduated from Asbury University, Drew Theological Seminary and the Hartford Seminary Foundation. He also received honorary degrees from both Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary. He and his wife, Helen, served as United Methodist missionaries in India from 1946 until 1962. Background Rather than pursue his Ph.D. in theology, David went to work as a missionary in India. When Seamands returned to the United States in 1962, he was appointed as pastor of the Wilmore United Methodist Church where he served for 22 years. Tapes of his sermons were sent by the tens of thousands around the world, and free to hundreds of missionaries overseas. Additional tens of thousands of his tapes dealing with the subject of damaged emotions were circulated before his book, Healing for Damaged Emotions (1.1 million sold), was ever published. In all, Seamands' seven books have sold more than two million copies. He was active in the field of Christian counseling and was recognized as a pioneer of the field at the 1992 Congress of Christian Counseling where, together with James Dobson, Larry Crabb and Gary Collins, he received the special \\"Paraklesis\\" Award. He and Helen were active in the beginnings of the Marriage Enrichment and Engaged Discovery movements and led over 2200 couples through these special weekend experiences. Upon his retirement from the local ministry in 1984, he taught pastoral care at Asbury Theological Seminary. From 1988 to 1992, he was appointed as the Dean of the Chapel at Asbury. Other works Seamands was also a delegate to six General Conferences, beginning in 1976. At four of those he presented the minority report for the legislative section dealing with issues of human sexuality. He also was responsible for the founding of the Evangelical Missions Council. In 1983 The Mission Society for United Methodists was organized. Just prior to his death, Seamands resigned from the Wilmore United Methodist Church, citing a complaint of sexual misconduct filed against him and apologizing for his abuse of the trust of those around him. At the time of his death, some 3 months later, he was undergoing a \\"one-year leave from all ministerial functions\\" as part of church-imposed discipline.

The double album Bright Moments (reissued as a double CD) is a near-definitive document of the Kirk live experience, and his greatest album of the '70s. The extroverted Kirk was in his element in front of an audience, always chatting, explaining his concepts, and recounting bits of jazz history. Even if some of his long, jive-talking intros can sound a little dated today, it's clear in the outcome of the music that Kirk fed voraciously off the energy of the room... Bright Moments empties all the major items out of Kirk's bag of tricks, providing a neat microcosm of his talents and displaying a consummate and knowledgeable showman.

She was Grand Duchess of Tuscany as the wife of the last Medici Grand Duke, Gian Gastone. Anna Maria Franziska was the elder surviving daughter of Julius Franz, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and Maria Hedwig of the Palatinate-Sulzbach. She married Philipp Wilhelm August of the Palatinate in 1690, with whom she had her only child, Maria Anna, in 1691. She was widowed in 1693. Four years later, she married Gian Gastone de' Medici, a Prince of Tuscany. With her brother-in-law Ferdinando de' Medici's death in 1713, her husband became Tuscany's heir-apparent. She became Grand Duchess of Tuscany upon the incumbent ruler's death in 1723. She was Grand Duchess for fourteen years before being widowed again in 1737. Biography Early life Sibylle (L), c. 1690 by an anonymous artist Anna Maria Franziska was born on 13 June 1673. She was the second child of the reigning duke of Saxe- Lauenburg and Maria Hedwig of Sulzbach, who died when Anna Maria was nine years-old. With the death of her father Duke Julius Francis on 30 September 1689 the Lauenburg line of the House of Ascania was extinct in the male line. However, female succession was possible by the Saxe-Lauenburgian laws. So the legal female heir to the throne, Duchess Anna Maria Franziska, and her sister Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg fought for the succession of the former, the elder of them. Also Julius Francis' cousin, Eleonore Charlotte of Saxe-Lauenburg- Franzhagen, claimed the succession. Their weakness was abused by Duke George William of the neighbouring Brunswick-Lunenburgian Principality of Lunenburg- Celle, who invaded Saxe-Lauenburg with his troops, thus inhibiting Anna Maria's ascension as Duchess regnant. Also other monarchies claimed the succession, evoking a conflict further involving the neighbouring duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and of Danish Holstein, as well as the five Ascanian- ruled Principalities of Anhalt, the Electorate of Saxony, which had succeeded the Saxe-Wittenbergian Ascanians in 1422, Sweden and Brandenburg. The conflict was finally settled on 9 October 1693 (Hamburger Vergleich), definitely ousting the dispossessed Anna Maria and her sister. Both sisters never gave up the claim. Emperor Leopold I rejected Celle's succession and thus retained the Saxe-Lauenburgian exclave of Hadeln, which was out of Celle's reach, in his custody. Only in 1728 his son Emperor Charles VI enfeoffed George II of Great Britain with Saxe-Lauenburg, finally legitimising the de facto takeover by his grandfather in 1689 and 1693. In 1731 George II also gained Hadeln from imperial custody. First marriage Philip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg, first husband of Anna Maria. A canvas by Pieter van der Werff, 1690 Anna Maria married Philipp Willhelm August of the Palatinate-Neuburg. The wedding took place in Bohemia, at the castle of Roudnice (Raudnitz) on 29 October 1690. He was the eighth son of Philip William, Elector Palatine.

They were married on 2 July 1697 by the Bishop of Osnabruck at D√ºsseldorf but they lived in the Kingdom of Bohemia, at chateaux of Ploskovice (Ploschkowitz) and Z√°kupy (Reichstadt). The new Princess of Tuscany had sprawling estates in the region. At the time of their marriage, contemporaries described the princess as \\"appalling and immensely fat\\". Anna Maria Franziska dominated her weak husband, which drove him into the arms of alcohol. He deplored her behaviour, \\"capriciousness, peevish faces and sharp words\\". Gian Gastone stayed with his wife for a mere ten months, before fleeing to Prague. The princess refused to leave Reichstadt, despite her husband's constant protestations. She believed that the Medici were in the habit of murdering their consorts.Strathern p 403 The Grand Duke attempted to force his daughter- in-law to move back to Tuscany with Gian Gastone. He asked the Pope, Clement XI, to send the Archbishop of Prague to reproach her, and convince her to fulfil her wifely obligations. She replied that there was no point because Gian Gastone was \\"absolutely impotent\\". He left without her in 1708.Strathern, p 404 Ferdinando, the heir to the collapsing grand duchy, died in 1713. Therefore, she became the Grand Princess of Tuscany. Later life Gian Gastone became Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1723, and, she, the Grand Duchess. Her husband continued to live in Florence, Tuscany's capital, and never saw his wife again. Gian Gastone lived a frivolous life there,Hale, p 189 staying up all night and waking up in the afternoon. As Grand Duchess, Anna Maria Franziska kept to her life of solitude at her castle, where she talked to the horses in the stables. Gian Gastone died in 1737. As the Medici had no male heir, Francis Stephen of Lorraine (later Holy Roman Emperor) ascended the grand ducal throne. She died in 1741.

It is a rare plant, found only in sporadic mountainous areas of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Buckleya distichophylla is a deciduous shrub growing to heights of up to , with leaves that are 2-4 inches in length requiring direct sunlight to grow. Its flowers are long with 4 yellow-green, long narrow bracts. What makes the piratebush unique is in how it survives. The plant does not survive on photosynthesis only as its pale green leaves indicate less chlorophyll than other plants. In addition to photosynthesis, piratebush receives nutrients through parasitizing other species. The plant is hemiparasitic, attaching itself to the root systems of other plants with structures called haustoria and draw nutrients through them. Although originally thought to attach itself only to hemlock trees, it has since been determined that piratebush can attach to many different species. At present, piratebush has only been identified in mountainous areas of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The greatest concentration of the plant can be found within the Poor Mountain Natural Area Preserve atop Poor Mountain, approximately southwest of Roanoke in Roanoke County, Virginia. The number of piratebush plants on Poor Mountain is greater than all of the others existing at other locations. Although many other locations in the Appalachians feature habitats that seemingly would support piratebush, scientists have yet to determine why the plant exists in so few places. The plant was initially discovered and described as a member of the genus Borya in the olive family by Thomas Nuttall in 1818 along the French Broad River in the vicinity of Paint Rock in Western North Carolina. The plant was rediscovered in 1843 by Samuel Buckley with John Torrey classifying the plant as Buckleya distichophylla.Plant of the Week, United States Department of Agriculture, National Forest Service References External links *Carolina Nature *Southeastern Flora Category:Santalaceae Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States Category:Plants described in 1818 Category:Taxa named by John Torrey Category:Taxa named by Thomas Nuttall ","title":"Buckleya distichophylla"},{"id":"24026214","text":"In-N-Out Records is a Japan-based record label.

He was selected 37th overall in the 2007 AFL Draft by North Melbourne.Player Profile at Kangaroos.com.au Early career As a teenager, Thompson starred in the Geelong Football League. Playing his preferred position of full back, Thompson played a key role in Geelong's VFL premiership side in 2007, his heroic actions stopping a key forward about 30 kg heavier than him in the 2006 grand final, has become legend at his local club, South Barwon. Thompson has said that playing on the big forwards of the GFL gave him a platform to build his whole AFL career on. North Melbourne Thompson made his debut for the Kangaroos in 2008, playing 6 games for the season. Thompson played every game in 2009, his best season to date, and has claimed some big scalps, including Port Adelaide's Warren Tredrea, Magpie Jack Anthony, Essendon veteran Matthew Lloyd and Brisbane spearhead Daniel Bradshaw, whom he kept goalless in 103 minutes of playing time in Round 10. Thompson has been dubbed 'Mr. Annoying,' as several of his opponents have been sent to the tribunal for responding to his niggling tactics, including Cameron Mooney and Jack Anthony, who headbutted him in the groin. On 22 May 2010 he was the centre of attention when he pushed over Western Bulldogs player Barry Hall whilst tying his shoelace, triggering an ugly altercation between Hall and several other Kangaroos players. Hall reacted to the taunts by putting Thompson in a headlock and was subsequently reported for both wrestling and rough conduct. All Australian team selector, Gerard Healy commented that Thompson's incredible performance this year is unheralded to date, and suggested that he was a definite contender for full back on the All Australian team. Thompson scored his first AFL goal in 2010 against West Coast and scored 2 the following year against Sydney. All 3 goals were from outside 50. Thompson was runner up for The Syd Barker Medal (NMFC Best and Fairest) in 2009 and 2012 coming second to Captain Andrew Swallow on both occasions. In 2012 Thompson also recorded a career high in disposals (39) against The Giants. In 2013 Thompson was announced in North Melbournes leadership group for the 2013 season and onwards with Andrew Swallow, Drew Petrie, Jack Ziebell, Daniel Wells, Brent Harvey and Taylor Hine. He won the 2013 Syd Barker Medal after an excellent and consistent year, tying with teammate Daniel Wells. Thompson had a great start to his 2014 season, including holding Lance Franklin goalless in the side's road win against Sydney in Round 4. However, Thompson finished up the season disappointingly but enhancing his offensive game was a huge positive for him. Thompson retired at the completion of the 2019 season after announcing it earlier in the year. He was still one of the first picked each week in his final season.

PSI helps ensure that production complies with the governing specification, contract, or purchase order. A final random inspection (FRI) checks finished products, often when at least 80% of an order has been produced and export-packed. Samples are selected at random, according to standards and procedures. Process Pre-shipment acceptance sampling, involving inspection and acceptance testing, may be agreed upon between a buyer, a supplier, and a bank, and it can be used to initiate payment under a letter of credit. A PSI can be performed at different stages before shipment, such as checking the total amount of goods and packing, controlling the quality or consistency of goods, checking of all documentation, as for example test reports, packaging list, or verification of compliance with standards of the destination country like ASME, CE mark and import duties. Inspection companies There are two types of PSI companies: *Free-market companies which are privately owned, selling their services to the market. Risks involved might be, especially if it is a smaller company, that the company is paid by the manufacturer and working in its interest. *State owned inspection companies: only very few companies operating on the market are state-owned or partly state-owned. The shareholding of governmental institutions guarantees independence and objectivity. A higher form of the PSI is called expediting, in which the dates of delivery and the production are included in the control. Termination on the Pre-shipment Inspection requirement PSI increases burdens and costs in international trade and can be counter-productive for the country of importation and its traders. Several countries are considering termination on the use of inspection companies' service, following upon WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation Article 10.5 Pre-shipment Inspection : 5.1. Members shall not require the use of pre-shipment inspections in relation to tariff classification and customs valuation.

Since its inception in 1987, Oceanco has built 29 custom superyachts up to 110m in length. Several 100m+ yachts are currently under construction. The company has the ability to simultaneously build 5 yachts in the 80m+ category (in various stages of design, engineering and construction), delivering approximately two yachts per year. In 2008 the company acquired more land adjacent to the present yard, and in 2010 they set about demolishing the old buildings and slips, to make way for a new state-of- the-art covered dry-dock, which now allows them to construct yachts up to 140 metres. The company operates in its extended production facility (total of 8.2ha) located in Alblasserdam, approximately 20 km from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The yard has unrestricted direct access via the inland waterway system to the North Sea. Oceanco also maintains a sales, design, marketing and communications office in Monaco. Oceanco is owned by Mohammed Al Barwani, an Omani billionaire. History Oceanco came into existence in 1987, when a group of South African private investors under the guidance of then CEO, Richard Hein, began yacht-building operations, with the hulls and superstructures built in Durban, South Africa. The yachts were then transported to various facilities in the Netherlands where the finishing work took place. In 2002, Theodore Angelopoulos took control of Oceanco and embarked on a new building strategy focusing on the niche market of 80m+ megayachts and developed the ‚ÄúY Generation‚Äù of Oceanco yachts which included Amevi (Y701), and Alfa Nero (Y702) . In 2008, the Anastasia was launched and in May 2009, the company launched the Vibrant Curiosity with her amidships atrium, a pool and large interior volumes designed by Nuvolari & Lenard. Current Mohammed Al Barwani, a private investor, who is based in the Sultanate of Oman, acquired Oceanco in March 2010. Barwani has interests in oil, gas, manufacturing, and minerals in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific through MB Holding as well as investments in various other diversified assets. Marcel Onkenhout, who has been with the company for 20 years, is the CEO. The company will celebrate its 30 years in 2017 and has since delivered 29 yachts. Sunrays, Oceanco‚Äôs megayacht, was delivered in March 2010. The late Bj√∂rn Johansson designed her exterior lines and the interior design is by Terence Disdale. She was succeeded by the Nuvolari & Lenard designed SEVEN SEAS, delivered in November 2010. More recently, the Sam Sorgiovanni designed NIRVANA was delivered in spring 2012, followed by St. Princess Olga in 2013, Equanimity in 2014 and Infinity in 2015. The largest yacht built by Oceanco is Jubilee. In 2018 the yard launched a second milestone, Project Bravo, a 109m superyacht. Several other Oceanco yachts are currently under construction.

Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as combat sports, American football, hockey, rugby union, rugby league and Australian rules football. It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries. Relationship to fencing reflex and posturing The fencing response designation arises from the similarity to the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex in infants. Like the reflex, a positive fencing response resembles the en garde position that initiates a fencing bout, with the extension of one arm and the flexion of the other. Tonic posturing (see abnormal posturing) preceding convulsion has been observed in sports injuries at the moment of impact where extension and flexion of opposite arms occur despite body position or gravity. The fencing response emerges from the separation of tonic posturing from convulsion and refines the tonic posturing phase as an immediate forearm motor response to indicate injury force magnitude and location. Pathophysiology The neuromotor manifestation of the fencing response resembles reflexes initiated by vestibular stimuli. Vestibular stimuli activate primitive reflexes in human infants, such as the asymmetric tonic neck reflex, Moro reflex, and parachute reflex, which are likely mediated by vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. The lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN; Deiter‚Äôs nucleus) has descending efferent fibers in the vestibulocochlear nerve distributed to the motor nuclei of the anterior column and exerts an excitatory influence on ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons while suppressing flexor motoneurons. The anatomical location of the LVN, adjacent to the cerebellar peduncles (see cerebellum), suggests that mechanical forces to the head may stretch the cerebellar peduncles and activate the LVN. LVN activity would manifest as limb extensor activation and flexor inhibition, defined as a fencing response, while flexion of the contralateral limb is likely mediated by crossed inhibition necessary for pattern generation. In simpler terms, the shock of the trauma manually activates the nerves that control the muscle groups responsible for raising the arm. This is similar to the reflexive extension of the arm when falling down (‚Äúbreaking a fall‚Äù). Injury severity and sports applications In a survey of documented head injuries followed by unconsciousness, most of which involved sporting activities, two thirds of head impacts demonstrated a fencing response, indicating a high incidence of fencing in head injuries leading to unconsciousness, and those pertaining to athletic behavior. Likewise, animal models of diffuse brain injury have illustrated a fencing response upon injury at moderate but not mild levels of severity as well as a correlation between fencing, blood brain barrier disruption, and nuclear shrinkage within the LVN, all of which indicates diagnostic utility of the response. The most challenging aspect to managing sport-related concussion (mild traumatic brain injury, TBI) is recognizing the injury. Consensus conferences have worked toward objective criteria to identify mild TBI in the context of severe TBI. However, few tools are available for distinguishing mild TBI from moderate TBI. As a result, greater emphasis has regularly been placed on the management of concussions in athletes than on the immediate identification and treatment of such an injury. On-field predictors of injury severity can define return-to-play guidelines and urgency of care, but past criteria have either lacked sufficient incidence for effective utility, did not directly address the severity of the injury, or have become cumbersome and fraught with inter-rater reliability issues. By providing a clear, discernible physiological event immediately upon injury, the fencing response can discern moderate brain injury forces from milder forces, providing an additional criterion by which the identification and classification of concussions can be improved, with immediate application to sport-related on-field diagnoses and decisions affecting return-to-play status for athletes, thereby facilitating the transition from diagnosis to the treatment of any post-concussion symptoms (PCS). Further application The fencing response may also have the potential to indicate traumatic brain injury for soldiers in military settings, specifically with regard to blast injury and subsequent shell shock. There are currently no studies or data to determine the utility of the fencing response in such an arena. Notable fencing displays Increased awareness of clinical significance on behalf of the bystander is critical to the utility of the fencing response designation. Therefore, notable fencing displays are listed below in order to aid the bystander in identifying the various physical manifestations of the fencing response as well as demonstrating the prevalence of such a response in popular sporting and social events. *Dennis Milton, professional boxer: following a punch to the head by Julian Jackson on September 14, 1991. *Justin McBride, professional bull rider: 2007 Glendale PBR *Jahvid Best, NCAA college football running back for the California Golden Bears: Oregon State vs. California, November 7, 2009 *Ben Askren, olympic wrestler and mixed martial artist: following a flying knee to the head by Jorge Masvidal in UFC 239 *Austin Collie, professional American football wide receiver for the Indianapolis Colts: Indianapolis vs. Philadelphia, November 8, 2010 *Denarius Moore, NCAA college football wide receiver for the Tennessee Volunteers: Tennessee vs. Alabama, October 23, 2010 *James Rodgers, NCAA college football wide receiver for the Oregon State Beavers: Oregon State vs. Boise State, September 25, 2010 *Kenny Shaw, NCAA college football wide receiver for Florida State: Oklahoma vs. Florida State, September 17, 2011 *Ulf Samuelsson, professional hockey player: following a punch to the head by Tie Domi *Nathan Horton, professional hockey player: following a hit from Aaron Rome *James May, a television presenter: after being thrown to the ground by a taut line *Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, a professional footballer: after a collision with the English defender Chris Smalling in the friendly England‚ÄìNetherlands match on February 29, 2012.

Clayton, IV) is an American literary critic who is known for his pioneering work on the relationship between nineteenth-century culture and postmodernism. He has published influential works on Romanticism and the novel, Neo-Victorian literature, steampunk, hypertext fiction, online games, contemporary American fiction, technology in literature, and genetics in literature and film. He is the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of English and Director of the Curb Center for Art, Enterprise, and Public Policy at Vanderbilt University. Academic career Clayton attended Highland Park High School in Dallas, Texas and The Hill School, in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, before going on to receive his B.A. from Yale University. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Virginia in 1979. He taught English at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison before moving to Vanderbilt University in 1988. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1999. As Chair of the English department at Vanderbilt from 2003 to 2010, he helped recruit renowned professors to the university. His first book Romantic Vision and the Novel, published by Cambridge University Press in 1987, compared Victorian realist fiction with romantic poetry. It proposed a theory of Romantic visionary moments in nineteenth-century English fiction as lyric disruptions of the narrative line. His book on multiculturalism in American fiction and theory, Pleasures of Babel: Contemporary American Literature and Theory, published by Oxford University Press in 1993, was selected by Choice as An Outstanding Academic Book for 1995. Surveying American fiction and literary theory from the 1970s-1990s, Clayton argued for the political and social power of narratives. His best known book, Charles Dickens in Cyberspace: The Afterlife of the Nineteenth Century in Postmodern Culture, was published by Oxford University Press in 2003. It won the Suzanne M. Glasscock Humanities Book Prize for Interdisciplinary Scholarship in 2004. Moving from Jane Austen and Charles Dickens to William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, Clayton shows how Victorian literature and technology reverberates in contemporary American culture. Clayton was an early adopter of digital approaches to pedagogy, teaching classes on hypertext and computer games beginning in 1996. In 2013, he launched a highly successful MOOC on the Coursera platform titled ‚ÄúOnline Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative,‚Äù which has reached over 85,000 students from more than 120 countries around the world.

He joined the third party after leaving the Republican Party over the Reagan administration's handling of the federal budget. He ran on a platform that included non-interventionism in foreign conflicts, decriminalization of illegal drugs on a federal level, a return to the gold standard, the abolition of the Federal Reserve and a reduction in all government spending. Paul defeated Native American activist Russell Means at the Libertarian Party's National Convention in Seattle to win the party's presidential nomination. Former Alaska State representative Andre Marrou was selected as his running mate. After over a year of campaigning as the Libertarian Party nominee, Paul received very little media coverage, and was excluded from presidential debates. On Election Day, he was on the ballot in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and finished in third place with approximately 0.47% of the vote, behind Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis and the winner Vice President George H.W. Bush. Background Paul was elected to Texas's 22nd congressional district as a Republican during a special election early in 1976, and he supported Ronald Reagan's presidential bid that year. Paul lost his bid for re-election in late 1976, but was elected back to the seat in 1978. During his time in office, Paul followed the political and economic principles of laissez-faire advocate Ludwig von Mises, and gained a reputation as Dr. No, voting against legislation he felt was unconstitutional. He also advanced legislation establishing term limits for Congressmen, and opposed any implementation of a military draft. After serving four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul vied for the 1984 Republican Party Senatorial nomination in Texas, and gained a reputation as an adept fundraiser. He was defeated in the primary and returned to his practice of obstetrics and gynecology In January 1987, Paul officially left the Republican Party to run for the Libertarian Party nomination after becoming disillusioned by the spending policies of the Reagan administration and presumptive Republican presidential nominee George H.W. Bush. On leaving the party, Paul remarked: \\"Ronald Reagan has given us a deficit ten times greater than what we had with the Democrats. It didn't take more than a month after 1981, to realize there would be no changes.\\" The Libertarian Party had courted Paul for the previous six years.Curtis, Tom, A Man for All Reasons, Texas Monthly, (Nov. 1987) Campaign developments Libertarian Party nomination campaign Congressman Ron Paul Ron Paul announced his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination on February 16, 1987 during a party luncheon in San Francisco, California. During his announcement speech, Paul commented that \\"Big government is running away with our freedom and our money, and the Republicans are just as much to blame as the Democrats.\\" He later proclaimed himself as \\"a choice for freedom.\\" According to Paul, Libertarian Party leaders notified him that there would be little opposition to his run at the party's September 1987 National convention. Paul campaigned for the nomination for the most part of 1987, traveling to numerous state conventions. He visited Pennsylvania in April to discuss the Libertarian Party's platform with students from Penn State. Native American activist, and challenger to Paul, Russell Means of South Dakota also appeared at the event. Means had officially announced his Libertarian presidential nomination candidacy a day before Paul. While Means received heightened media attention for his comments regarding Native Americans and militancy, reports in the news media circulated that highlighted Paul's calls for the nation to return to the Gold Standard, and diminish the power of the Federal Reserve. Paul and Means were described as members of the right and left wing of the Libertarian Party, respectively. By June, Paul was appearing at speaking events with Libertarian vice presidential candidate Andre Marrou. Marrou had previously served as a Libertarian member of the Alaska House of Representatives. The pair campaigned side-by-side in Idaho where Paul remarked \\"that a Libertarian can win the White House in the not-too-distant future.\\" After that, Paul traveled west to address Libertarian Party officials in Washington and Oregon. By the end of the month, Paul had raised $200,000 for his campaign. As the convention approached, Paul was one of seven candidates vying for the party's nomination. However, he and Means were the only candidates mentioned in the press. Speculation that Marrou could be chosen as a compromise candidate also surrounded the event, at which 800 attendees were expected. Libertarian National Convention The Libertarian National Convention, formally called the Culture of Freedom Conference and Presidential Nominating Convention, was held from September 2‚Äì6 at the Sheraton Hotel in Seattle, Washington. His candidacy was seen as problematic because of the party's long support for freedom of choice on abortions. One of his opponents, Native American activist Russell Means, emphasized that he was pro-choice on the abortion issue.Wallace Turner, Major Libertarian Candidate Opposes Party Stand on Abortion, New York Times, September 4, 1987. In a forum held prior to the nomination, Means dismissed the greater funds raised by Paul's campaign, commenting that Means was receiving \\"10 times more press\\" than the former Congressman and was therefore \\"100 times more effective.\\" Another candidate expressed his desire to \\"put handcuffs on all IRS agents.\\" Paul was nominated on the first ballot with 196 of the 368 votes cast, with his closest opponent, Means, receiving 120 votes. He accepted the nomination and thanked the delegates with his wife, Carol, by his side. Alaska state legislator Andre Marrou, one of the party's few elected officeholders, was chosen as the vice presidential nominee. General election campaign Paul filmed an eight-minute television commercial Paul returned to the campaign trail and entered the General election stretch of the campaign a year ahead of the nominees for the two major parties. He traveled to Universities held press conferences and filmed an eight-minute television advertisement, to be shown in small states and on cable television, to help spread his message. He focused on gaining enough support to win a place in the League of Women Voters-sponsored presidential debates. Spreading the message Paul held one of his numerous press conferences in Helena, Montana, where he pushed for the Reagan administration to balance the budget and cut spending and taxes. He argued that Reagan had reneged on his 1980 campaign promise to balance the budget, resulting in voter dissatisfaction. Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy. Paul was featured in the November 1987 issue of Texas Monthly. The article compared the campaign to that of former U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy, and made note of Paul's opposition to the CIA's assistance of the Contras in Nicaragua. Journalist Tom Curtis described Paul's supporters as \\"a ragtag coalition of antiabortion activists, tax rebels, anti-war types, gold bugs and other anti- establishment, single issue voters.\\" Curtis noted that Paul's monthly newsletter, The Ron Paul Investment Letter had 12,000 subscribers who paid an annual fee of $99. Paul traveled to Rome, Georgia and appeared at the downtown Holiday Inn in November 1987. During the appearance, he railed against the policies of Washington D.C., commenting that there was no difference between the two major parties, and that both supported \\"intervention overseas, ... in our personal lives ... [and] in the marketplace.\\" Paul went on to compare his Libertarian ideology to the mindset of the founding fathers. The next month, vice presidential nominee Andre Marrou traveled to Texas and discussed the Paul campaign's prospects. He opined that the ticket could possibly win 2 to 12 million votes in the following year's election, and that Paul might win if Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson were selected as the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively. He explained that America did not want a preacher as president. Since the chance that either of those candidates would be named as their party's representative seemed unlikely, by this point in the election one of the campaign's priorities was securing a place on the ballot, which they had done in 20 of the 50 states. In a 1988 interview with Alternative Views, Paul described in detail his views on the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Federal Reserve system, and the American power structure. \\"Kamikaze\\" campaign Paul arrived in North Florida for a campaign event in early January 1988, with ten months still remaining until the election. The event was chronicled by a journalist for the Ocala Star-Banner, who compared Paul to a kamikaze and remarked that he never gives up even though his \\"chance of becoming president\\" was no greater than that for the journalist himself. Paul was described as \\"slim, attractive, graying, immaculately attired and most articulate,\\" but as a candidate who was dismissed by the media for his political positions such as support of the decriminalization of hard drugs. Paul visited the University of Florida during his trip, and gave a campaign speech in front of 200 students in the auditorium in Turlington Hall. Later in the month, he left Florida and campaigned in Iowa, where he spoke at Drake University and the University of Iowa. In February, he received the endorsement of Former Congressman Pete McCloskey (R-Calif.). He was also endorsed by comedian and talk-show host David Letterman,Kramer, David (2011-02-14) He Who Laughs Last‚Ä¶, LewRockwell.com as well as psychologist and counterculture icon Timothy Leary, who held a fundraiser for Paul.Gillespie, Nick (2011-12-09) Five myths about Ron Paul, Washington Post Paul had received little media attention during the early stages of the Democratic and Republican primary contests. But as Vice President George H.W. Bush and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis secured their respective parties' nominations, mentions of Paul increased. It was noted that if Bush became unacceptable to conservatives, they would not turn to Dukakis, but would most likely vote for Paul as a protest. During this time, publications also started discussed Paul's tax policy. It called for a flat income tax rate of 10% on all earnings over $10,000 annually. Paul sold his tax plan while campaigning in Utah. In front of 250 people in Kane County, he hailed California's 1978 passage of Proposition 13 as starting the \\"tax revolt and [sending] a message across the country. The next big message for this country should be the overwhelming passage of the tax initiatives ... in November.\\" Paul was also part of C-SPAN's program Road to the White House, which followed different candidates on the campaign trail. In June, they aired Paul's address to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.Paul's speech to NORML (June 17, 1988) During a July press conference in Spokane, Washington, while lobbying for ballot access, Paul promised that as president he would veto spending increases for both domestic programs and the military. He asked in reference to the portrayal of his party's plank, \\"what's extreme about a balanced budget?\\" Paul conceded that he would not win the election but explained that votes for his ticket would give a bigger voice to Libertarian issues in American politics, and that he would only be disappointed if he did not receive at least 5% of the vote in the state. A few weeks later, The New York Times discovered that many former members of the Pat Robertson campaign were helping Ron Paul's candidacy. They found that the campaign workers were disseminating literature in Michigan that criticized Bush, and stated that Paul would \\"carry the standard\\" of the free market. Paul commented in a San Diego Union interview that he \\"identif[ied]with Robertson\\" although \\"he's not a libertarian.\\" Paul spent the beginning of August, campaigning in his home state of Texas. Final stages In August, Republicans began to argue that a vote for Paul would equate to a vote for Dukakis. Later in the month, Republicans grew weary of Dan Quayle as the party's vice presidential nominee. Paul commented that \\"we like Dan Quayle. We also like George Bush and Mike Dukakis. They have been the best recruiters we have.\\" He explained that the Libertarian Party was receiving around 100 calls a day from people interested in the party because \\"a large number of Americans are disenchanted with the choice they have.\\" Paul held a rally in Salt Lake City that drew 200 supporters, and proclaimed that he \\"wouldn't be surprised if we got 20% of the vote in Utah.\\" By October 1988, the campaign had secured ballot access in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and newspapers across the nation began running editorials and letters supporting Paul's run, and criticizing the low volume of media coverage. The New York Times chronicled Paul's campaign in late October. Paul's 25-year-old son, Rand Paul who served as the aide-de-camp, was interviewed and explained that Paul had raised $2 million, $500,000 of which was spent on ballot access. Paul had spent $40,000 a month on traveling expenses. Just prior to Election Day, Paul predicted a low voter turnout. Results Paul finished in third place on Election Day, far behind Dukakis and the victorious George H.W. Bush. He received 431,750 votes, which made up 0.47% of the overall vote. He received 203,639 more votes than the Bergland/Lewis ticket four years prior. The largest percentage won by Paul came in Alaska, where he received 2.74%. In Washington, he missed his goal of 5% with a 0.92% showing. In Utah, Paul received 1.16%. Aftermath 2008 presidential run After the election, Paul was speculated to run for president in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan.Dondero, Eric (2008-01-07) Ron Paul on the Verge of Going Third Party?, National Ledger That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction in the size of the federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran for president again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.

Professional life Derald Wing Sue was majoring in biology at Oregon State University when he took a psychology class and became fascinated by what he had learned. He switched to psychology and loved the classes he was taking but at a certain point he began to rebel and question the teachings that did not seem to match his own experiences. He believed that the theories in counseling and psychotherapy were class-bound and culture-bound. Sue obtained his bachelor's degree from Oregon State University, and then a MS and PhD in counseling psychology from the University of Oregon. In 1965 Sue was exposed to humanistic teachings by a woman named Leona Tyler who was the past president of the American Psychological Associations. Sue found the academic presence validating but that the curriculum was invalid because of race and culture being spoken rarely besides in a superficial and intellectual way. After completing his degree, he became a counselor at the University of California, Berkeley counseling center, and was known as the counselor who supported Asian American students. During his time at Berkeley, he conducted mental health studies on Asian Americans, which then led him to coauthor two books: A Theory of Multicultural Counseling and Therapy and Understanding Abnormal Behavior. In 1972, Sue and his brother Stanley, cofounded the Asian American Psychological Association because of the lack of research on Asian American mental health. Sue was the founding president of the organization. In 1981, Sue published Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice. This book became a lightning rod for controversy because of his philosophy on multicultural counseling. The text contains revisions of previous writings Sue published on counseling barriers, counselors‚Äô credibility, and worldviews on counseling. In addition, the text emphasizes the understanding of the sociopolitical nature of counseling and counseling social justice . There is also a chapter on ‚ÄúCritical Incidents in Cross-Cultural Counseling‚Äù specifically aimed at ‚Äúhighlighting and illustrating crucial issues/concerns/decision points likely to arise in several cross-cultural counseling situations that involve people from different cultural/racial backgrounds‚Äù. Sue became a professor because of his desire to teach and spread his ideas and awareness of multiculturalism. As a professor he attempted to create a cross-cultural counseling class and tried to fuse cultural concepts into all the courses that he taught, though he did receive backlash from students and faculty who believed that, regardless of cultural differences, good counseling was good counseling . His students found his teachings suspicious, defiant, and ‚Äúpolitically correct.‚Äù They challenged him for purely focusing on race and ethnicity in counseling . Sue responded to his students and, with each course that he taught, he developed more detailed theories and practices. Sue challenged his students to be committed to understanding multicultural counseling and become proactive in their techniques. However, they too received backlash from faculty and colleagues who stated that their behavior was unprofessional. Realizing the issues that his students were having he encouraged them to seek allies and supporters for their multicultural counseling cause. In addition to being a professor of psychology at Teachers College, he served on Bill Clinton's President's Advisory Board on Race in 1996.

It is a remake of the 1973 ABC made-for-television horror film of the same name. The film stars Katie Holmes, Guy Pearce, and Bailee Madison, as a family moving into a 19th-century Rhode Island mansion, where the withdrawn daughter (Sally) begins to witness malevolent creatures that emerge from a sealed ash pit in the basement of the house. Jack Thompson, Alan Dale, Garry McDonald, and Julia Blake star in supporting roles. An international co-production between the United States, Australia, and Mexico, it was filmed at the Drusilla Mansion in Mount Macedon and Melbourne (both in Victoria, Australia). The film was released in the United States on August 26, 2011, by Miramax Films and FilmDistrict. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised Holmes, Pearce and Madison's performances, direction, atmosphere and musical score, but criticized the lack of originality and jump scares and grossed $38.3 million against a $25 million budget. Plot At Blackwood Manor in Providence County, Rhode Island in the 19th century, renowned wildlife painter Lord Blackwood summons his housekeeper to the basement where he reluctantly bludgeons her to death. He removes her teeth, as well as his own, and offers them to mysterious creatures inside an ash pit within an old fireplace; the creatures reject his offer and demand only the teeth of children. Blackwood begs for them to give back his kidnapped son, only to be dragged in by the creatures. In present day, 8-year old Sally Hurst arrives in Rhode Island to live with her father Alex and his girlfriend Kim, both restoring Blackwood Manor to put it on the market for their client. Sally is depressed due to her mother forcefully putting her in Alex's care and giving her copious amounts of Adderall. The creatures are awakened by a tune from the nightlight. The next day, Sally hears the creatures calling her name and follows the voices to a sealed fireplace. \\"BE AFRAID\\" is written in runes above it. She opens the fireplace and finds one of the old housekeeper's teeth. The creatures prove to be hostile, stealing Alex's razor and shredding Kim's clothes. Alex blames Sally and finds a 19th-century silver coin in her possession, which she found under her pillow after the tooth disappeared. Sally sneaks to the basement to talk with the creatures, but Mr. Harris, one of the workers, sends her away and tries to seal the fireplace. The creatures brutally wound him and he is hospitalized. Kim visits Harris in the hospital, who tells her to find the unpublished artwork of Lord Blackwood in the local library. The artwork is of a creature the librarian describes as being like tooth fairies, which sometimes turn a human into one of their own. Sally is attacked again by the creatures, the leader being a transformed Lord Blackwood. Kim finds an undiscovered mural painted by Blackwood, depicting his son being taken by the creatures. Sally is trapped in the library by the creatures, but fends them off using her camera flash since they are afraid of the light. She also manages to kill one of them. Alex and Kim try to flee the house with Sally but they are all ambushed by the creatures and knocked out. When Sally wakes up, her feet have been tied, and the creatures are starting to drag her to the basement for her transformation. Kim awakens and frees Sally only to get caught herself in the ropes and break her leg. The creatures drag Kim into the fireplace, as a distraught Sally crushes the creature who used to be Lord Blackwood to death. Alex and Sally mourn Kim's loss. Some time later, both return to the abandoned mansion to leave a drawing of Kim there. After they leave, a draft pulls the drawing into the creatures' lair; the entrance is now bolted with metal. The caring Kim has been transformed. As the creatures plan to come out, Kim convinces them to stay in hiding because they \\"have all the time in the world\\" and others will come to the manor.

For the design of the creatures in the film, Nixey drew inspiration from pictures of mole rats. Influences Del Toro has attributed the idea of giving the creatures in the film a fairy origin to the work of the writer Arthur Machen, saying in an interview: \\"I love the Welsh author Arthur Machen and his idea that fairy lore comes from a dark place, that it‚Äôs derived from little, pre-human creatures who are really, really nasty vermin but are magical in a way, living as they do for hundreds of years. His books are what compelled me to do this.\\" Machen's stories are specifically mentioned in the film by the librarian character. Del Toro is a long-standing admirer of Machen and said his work was also an influence on El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) and Hellboy II: The Golden Army both of which also feature fairy creatures. The name of \\"Emerson Blackwood\\", the character who built the mansion in the film, is a tribute to Algernon Blackwood, another writer of supernatural horror stories.

The son of George Farrow, a cement manufacturer in Ipswich, and his wife Emily, G.E. Farrow was educated in London and America. In 1891 he was working as a clerk to the Collector of Inland Revenue and was living at No 190 Dalston Lane in Hackney. In 1901 he was living at No 83 Sterndale Road in Hammersmith. By this time his occupation is listed as 'Author'.1901 England Census Record for George E Farrow On both these dates his mother was living with him.1891 England Census Record for George E Farrow He also lived for a time in Brook Green in West Kensington. During his literary career Farrow wrote more than thirty books for children. He encouraged his young readers to write to him, answered their letters, and let their tastes and opinions guide his future works (rather like his American contemporary L. Frank Baum). Though he wrote adventure tales and poetry, Farrow was best known for his nonsense books written in the tradition of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, especially his Wallypug series, including: * The Wallypug of Why (1895) * Adventures in Wallypugland (1898) * The Wallypug in London (1898) * In Search of the Wallypug (1903) * The Wallypug in Fogland (1904) * The Wallypug in the Moon (1905) -- and others; thirty-four volumes in all. His last book was The Mysterious Shin Shira, published in 1915. Surprisingly for a popular and prolific author, little is known of Farrow's life. We can glean a few sparse facts from the prefaces to his books: that he owned an armchair called Pendennis; had a dog called Gip, and was known to his friends as 'Gef'.Gillian Avery, Introduction to The Wallypug of Why Victor Gollanz Ltd (1968) pg 8 We can infer, perhaps, from those prefaces in which he repeatedly begged for letters from his young readers that he was lonely and childless. We can guess with the frequency with which he changed publishers that he was dissatisfied with the terms they offered. Until recently, even the year of his birth was not known with certainty,Discovered by researcher Glenn Christodoulou it having been estimated at 1866, partly based on a reference in the Preface to an 1898 book: :One of my correspondents, aged eight, has embarrassed me very much indeed by suggesting that I should \\"wait for her till she grows up,\\" as she should \\"so like to marry a gentleman who told stories.\\" I hope she didn't mean that I did anything so disgraceful; and besides, as it would take nearly twenty-five years for her to catch up to me, she might change her mind in that time, and then what would become of me.G. E. Farrow, The Wallypug in London, London, Hutchinson & Co., 1898; pp. 6-7. What did become of Farrow is also obscure. Author Noel Streatfeild has speculated, :I think he must have met a Snark who turned out to be a Boojum, for he certainly has \\"softly and suddenly vanished away.\\"Noel Streatfeild, ed., To the Land of Fair Delight, London, Gollancz, 1960; Introduction, p. 7.

He is known to the general public for his powers of purification of the unclean, in particular in respect to sexual diseases. Ucchu·π£ma was also thought to be able to change a female fetus into a male one. Temples A non-exhaustive list of temples that enshrine Ucchu·π£ma are as follows, arranged according to tradition: Shingon *Mangan-ji (Chiba)) *Kiburi-ji (Gifu) *Fud≈ç-in (Kyoto) Tendai *T≈çk≈ç-ji (Tokyo) *Kannonsh≈ç-ji (Shiga) S≈çt≈ç Zen *Kaiun-ji (Tokyo) *Zuiry≈´-ji (Toyama) *Akiba S≈çhonden Kasuisai (Shizuoka) *My≈çtoku-ji (Shizuoka *Daik≈ç-in (Aichi) J≈çdo-sh≈´ *Tairy≈´-ji (Tokyo) Nichiren *Gokoku-ji (Kyoto) *Honky≈ç-ji (Hy≈çgo) ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra According to the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra, Shakyamuni Buddha asked the bodhisattvas and arhats to present their methods of understanding the ultimate truth. The eighteenth person to present his character was Ucchu·π£ma. The S≈´tra states: :Ucchu·π£ma came before the Buddha, put his palms together, bowed at the Buddha‚Äôs feet, and said to the Buddha, \\"I can still remember how many kalpas ago I was filled with excessive greed and desire. There was a Buddha in the world named King of Emptiness. He said that people with too much desire turn into a raging mass of fire. He taught me to contemplate the coolness and warmth throughout my entire body. :A spiritual light coalesced inside and transformed my thoughts of excessive lust into the fire of wisdom. After that, when any of the Buddhas summoned me, they used the name 'fire-head.' :From the strength of the fire-light samƒÅdhi, I accomplished Arhatship. I made a great vow that when each of the Buddhas accomplishes the way, I will be a powerful knight and in person subdue the demons' hatred. :The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I used attentive contemplation of the effects of heat in my body and mind, until it became unobstructed and penetrating and all my outflows were consumed. I produced a blazing brilliance and ascended to enlightenment. This is the foremost method.\\"The Surangama Sutra with Commentary - Volume 5 - Explained by Venerable Master Hsuan Hua p.94 Ucchu·π£ma VajrapƒÅla S≈´tra The Ucchu·π£ma VajrapƒÅla S≈´tra asserts that Ucchu·π£ma is actually the Vajra manifestation of Shakyamuni Buddha. Legend has it that when Shakyamuni Buddha was about to enter into Nirvana, all heavenly beings, with the exception of the ‚ÄòSpiral Hair-knot Brahma King‚Äô, came to pay their respect to Buddha. The Brahma King was in fact enjoying himself with the heavenly maidens in his own celestial palace. The heavenly gods, being unhappy with the arrogance of the Brahma King, went to his abode and try to persuade him to attend the Dharma assembly. Upon reaching his palace however, the gods found themselves trapped in the defiled energy cast by the supernatural powers of the king. Even some of the Vajra Deities (ÈáëÂâõÁ•û) who were later sent to apprehend the Brahma King were imprisoned by the foul forces as well. When Shakyamuni Buddha came to learn of this, He employed His Original Wisdom (Êú¨Êô∫), and the Light of Perpetual Joy and Pliancy was emitted from His heart. Ucchu·π£ma VajrapƒÅla (Á©¢Ë∑°ÈáëÂâõ) soon appeared from amidst the revolving radiance of the Buddha‚Äôs heart, and ascended to the celestial palace of the Brahma King. Despite the defiled energy hurled at Him by the Brahma King, Ucchu·π£ma was unharmed as he immediately turned these forces of contamination into ordinary soil. In no time, the Brahma King was subdued and brought to the feet of Shakyamuni Buddha. For this reason, Ucchu·π£ma is also known as the \\"Filth-Eliminating VajrapƒÅla\\" (‰∏çÊ∑®ÈáëÂâõ).Ucchusma Vajrapala Sutra Mantras According to the Ucchu·π£ma VidyƒÅrƒÅja DhƒÅra·πái, the mantra provided should be recited forty thousand times by any good man or good woman who is besieged with ailments inflicted by evil spirits. On the tenth day of purification, it should be recited one thousand eight times resulting in the removal of myriad afflictions.

The park is located along University Avenue. The park is in size and stretches along the north side of University from Fairview to Aldine street.Karlson, Karl J. (October 19, 2003). \\"WHAT IS IT ? - IT LOOKS FAMILIAR, BUT...\\". Saint Paul Pioneer Press The land was donated to the city in 1909 but was never developed as a public green space. Since the park's founding sections have been paved over for parking lots and other sections are used as front yards for businesses. Proposals for redevelopment gained traction in the 2000s with support from the original family that donated the land. The park is often mistaken as a broad setback from buildings on University Avenue. History left There are two variations on how the park was created. According to Donald L. Empson in his book The Street Where You Live an area from University north to Thomas Avenue and Fairview Avenue east to Aldine Street was platted in 1906 as Dickerman Park. The subdivision, owned by the Dickerman family, was reconfigured six years later by Dickerman Investment Company and Griggs, Cooper & Co. to move the lots from abutting University Avenue back establishing a greenspace along the two blocks. In 1929 an atlas noted that the land was \\"dedicated for a parkway\\".Empson, Donald L. (2006). The Street Where You Live: A Guide to the Place Names of Saint Paul. University of Minnesota Press. . According to most other sources the land was donated by Dickerman Investment Co. in 1909 for \\"park and parkway\\" purposes. The donation was intended to spur development around the Dickerman Park Addition, a platted development owned by the company. The company's president was G.G. Dickerman, and secretary was C.K. Dickerman. At the time city planners envisioned University Avenue to become a sweeping boulevard similar to Champs-√âlys√©es. In 1957 the westernmost portion was paved over for use by the Griggs-Midway Building with consent by the City of Saint Paul. In 1977 the Midway YMCA built a ten car parking lot again with permission from the city. Since then the Midway YMCA and several charter schools on the east side of the park have constructed playgrounds on the park apparently without official approval from the city. Redevelopment thumb Community groups have tried to revitalize the park several times.Hopfensperger, Jean (January 13, 1990) \\"University Av. revival plan moves forward\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press The most recent push began in 2003 with a charette led by the \\"St. Paul on the Mississippi Design Center\\". It was also sponsored by Dickerman Park Task force which grew out of the St. Paul Friends of the Parks and Trails. The charette split into three groups which produced four designs for the project. The use of the space as a playground gained little support with only one group including play areas for the around 600 students who attend one of the several charter schools or are involved in the YMCA. Most plans focused on unifying the fragmented park with either turf or native planting underneath the 100-year-old oak trees. One of the challenges of having play areas for children is the necessary division from busy University Avenue. In 2005 Kent Dickerman, the last Dickerman descendant still living in Saint Paul, found out about the park donated by his grandfather and great-uncle. He contacted his relatives and helped raise $45,000 for analysis and preliminary design to revitalize the park.Crosbie, Jackie (December 8, 2005) \\"Plan: From parking lots to strolling park - A long- ignored strip of land in St. Paul's Midway area that has been paved over might get a $5 million makeover.

His wife's name appears to have been Mar√≠a. She gave him two daughters: Fronilde and Teresa. In 1126 or 1127 he made a grant to Braga Cathedral. He is last mentioned in a document of 18 May 1135.

He was the son of Jacob Fjelde, who was a well-known sculptor in Norway when he emigrated to the United States in 1887.Jakob Fjelde (Store norske leksikon) After Jacob‚Äôs untimely death at age 36, the Fjelde family moved to North Dakota in 1902. Margarethe Fjelde homesteaded with her four children in Burleigh County, North Dakota. Fjelde studied art in Valley City, North Dakota at the State Normal School, now the Valley City State University. He subsequently went to study under Chicago based sculptor Lorado Taft.

Fjelde served as chairman of the Sculpture Department at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He was an instructor of sculpture at the National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts. He was editor of Sculpture Review between 1951 and 1955. Among Fjelde‚Äôs most commonly recognized sculptural works is the Lincoln Monument in Frogner Park in Oslo. His father's brother, Herman Olaus Fjelde (1866‚Äì1918), was chairman of the committee for the Lincoln Monument. On July 4, 1914, North Dakota Governor Louis Hanna presented the bronze bust of Abraham Lincoln to the nation of Norway.Herman Olaus Fjelde (Store norske leksikon) During World War II, the bust in Frogner Park became a center for silent protest against Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.

Cyrene and another similar vessel Xanthus were somewhat unusual in that they had clipper bows and were both originally built as yachts. Construction and launching Cyrene was built in Seattle in a boatyard on the site of Colman Dock. The vessel was commissioned as a yacht by James M. Colman, a prominent early Seattle businessman. Colman hoped that the building of the yacht would encourage employment in the shipyard. Matt Anderson superintended the construction of the vessel.Kline, M.S., and Bayless, G.A. Ferryboats: A Legend on Puget Sound, Bayless Books, Seattle 1983 , at pages 145-46. She was launched in 1891 and passed her final inspection at the end of July that year. As originally built, Cyrene was long, in beam, and had a draft of . She displaced 21 gross tons. She was substantially enlarged in 1904 in order to carry more passengers at a cost of $4,000. The work was done at Atwood's wharf near Leschi Park. After this rebuild, she displaced 25 gross tons. She was lengthened to and had her beam increased to . Her pilothouse was moved to the upper deck in order to create more room for passengers on the lower deck. Cyrene's original engine was removed and installed on Inland Flyer in late 1900. Seattle Machine Works built a new compound steam engine for Cyrene in 1901, and it was installed at least by April of that year. At least as early as 1901, she had electric lights aboard for nighttime operation.  Service as a yacht (18911900)  Immediately after her final inspection, on August 2, 1891, Cyrene headed north to East Sound on Orcas Island. She was base camp for a two-week camping expedition for 42 vacationers. Guests enjoyed tennis, bonfires, singing, and stories. This camping expedition became an almost annual affair. The Colman family used her as a setting for dinner parties for their friends. There were excursions to Port Orchard, Tacoma, Alki Point, Olympia, among others. Laurence J. Colman, James' son, took his Sunday school class on an outing.  Lake Washington passenger ferry (19001914)  Anderson Steamboat Company advertising Cyrene in 1905 John L. Anderson purchased Cyrene from Colman in March 1900. The two of them had been partners in Winnifred, in the early 1890s. Anderson sailed the vessel to Lake Washington by way of the difficult Black River route, the only natural riverine access from Puget Sound to Lake Washington. Starting in the summer of 1900, Anderson ran the vessel as a passenger ferry between Madison Park and Leschi Park. In 1903, Anderson acquired Xanthus, another of James Coleman's yachts. He paired her with Cyrene to create a passenger ferry service that ran every half hour between Leschi Park, Madrona Park, and Madison Park. The fare was 10 cents. Business was good. Too good on occasion. In 1907 Cyrene was fined $393.50 for taking 30 more passengers than the law allowed. In 1914 Cyrene ran from Leschi Park to various points on the west side of Mercer Island eleven times daily. Cyrene on Lake Washington, 1905 In addition to her ferry service, Cyrene was chartered for private cruises. For example, on July 31, 1900 the Seattle Chamber of Commerce entertained the officers of the 1st Cavalry, then encamped at Fort Lawton, on a lake cruise and dinner. Cyrene hosted wedding parties, the Norse Club of Seattle, college fraternities, and many other private events. On May 23, 1901 she hosted thirteen members of Congress from Ohio, on their way home from San Francisco where they had viewed the launch of the battleship Ohio.  End of Cyrene  There is no advertising or other press account of Cyrene sailing after 1914, but neither is there any report of her being sold or broken up. She drops from Federal registration in 1915 so it seems likely that she was broken up. Wreck divers in Lake Washington have identified a hull that conforms to the general size and shape of Cyrene, but the ship cannot be definitively identified.

The works of Jayadeva have had a profound influence on Indian culture. They form the basis of the east Indian classical dance form, Odissi as well as traditional classical music of the state, Odissi music and have strongly influenced the Bharatanatyam classical dance as well as Carnatic music. Jayadeva's composition has also been incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. Religion Jayadeva has had a profound influence on the religious practices of Hinduism. The classic Tribhangi (threefold) posture of Krishna playing the flute gained popularity due to him. Dashavatara Jayadeva was instrumental in popularizing the Dasavatara, the ten incarnations of Krishna in his composition Dasakritikrite. Additionally, the Gita Govinda begins with a Dasavatara stotra. In Jayadeva's version of Dasavatara, Buddha is an incarnation of Vishnu, while Krishna is not incorporated because Krishna is the source of all incarnations. as the lyrics say: keshava dhrta buddha sarira= krishna who appears in the form of Lord Buddha. Since Keshava is another name of Krishna, that means Krishna is the source of/incarnate as Buddha. In July 2009, the government of India's Department of Posts decided to release 11 stamps in Bhubaneswar to commemorate the birth of Jayadeva. One stamp depicts the poet himself, while the other ten depict the Dasavatara. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik unveiled the stamps at a special function in Jayadev Bhawan. They are in the denomination of Rs 5. A total of 800,000 stamps were released for sale in Odisha. Hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib Two hymns composed by Jayadeva have been incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikh religion. Although it is not clear how these medieval Orissan hymns found their way to the Sikh religion, there are records narrating how Jayadeva's work had a profound influence on Guru Nanak during his visit to Puri.Visit of Guru Nanak Music and dance Odissi In the opinion of researcher scholars, Jayadeva is among the centralmost figures in Odia culture. Jayadeva's ashtapadis are sung in dance performances of Odissi, the classical dance of Odisha . Classical music of Odisha The traditional classical music of Odisha, known as Odissi music, lays emphasis based on ragas and talas specified by Jayadeva's hymns. Jayadeva is known to have sung the Gitagovinda every night in the temple of Jagannatha, the central deity of Odisha. The tradition of singing Gitagovinda during Jagannatha's last ritual continues till today. Fine arts Jayadeva and his Gita Govinda had gained considerable popularity and had emerged as a painter‚Äôs theme by the late 15th century, though no such early paintings are available now. The earliest reported Gita Govinda paintings are from Mewar between 1590 and 1600 A.D. Patachitra paintings The Gita Govinda composed by Jayadeva is one of the popular themes in the traditional patachitra paintings of Odisha. Pahari paintings Jayadeva had a profound influence on the Pahari school during the 17th-19th centuries, which was prevalent throughout northern India bordering the Himalayas (from Jammu through Himachal Pradesh). In particular, Jayadeva's Radha and Krishna served as popular themes for Basohli painting in Jammu and Kashmir.Pahari centres Arts of India: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Music, Dance and Handicraft, by Krishna Chaitanya. Published by Abhinav Publications, 1987. . Page 62. The Gita Govinda Gita Govinda manuscript c. 1500. The Gita Govinda is the best-known composition of Jayadeva. It is a lyrical poetry that is organized into 12 chapters. Each chapter is further sub-divided into 24 divisions called prabandhas. The prabandhas contain couplets grouped into eights, called Ashtapadis. The first English translation of the Gita Govinda was published by Sir William Jones in 1792. Sir William Jones in the preface of his English rendering of GitaGovinda had commented: > \\"Jayadeva was born as he tells himself in Kenduli which many believe to be > in Kalinga, but since there is a town of similar name in Burdwan, the > natives of it insist that the finest lyrical poet of India was their > countryman.\\" At last the village Kenduli in Burdwan (Division) was accepted in his paper 'The Musical Modes of Hindus' written by Jones himself. Since then, the Gita Govinda has been translated to many languages throughout the world and is considered to be among the finest examples of Sanskrit poetry. Noteworthy among them is Love Song of the Dark Lord, by Barbara Stoler Miller. Other literary contributions Jayadeva wrote Piyusha Lahari, a Sanskrit Goshti Rupaka.Piyusha Lahari published in Nagari Script in the Journal of The Kalinga Historical Research Society, vol 1, part 4 It was based on the romantic love between Radha and Krishna similar in line to Gita Govindam.

This pathogen is present throughout the United States (but is most prominent in the South), South America, Asia, Africa and recently in the Kimberley region of Australia. First defined in 1935, E. canis emerged in the United States in 1963 and its presence has since been found in all 48 contiguous United States. Reported primarily in dogs, E. canis has also been documented in felines and humans, where it is transferred most commonly via Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick.  Transmission cycle  The brown dog tick, R. sanguineus, acts as the primary vector of E. canis, transferring the pathogen between hosts during blood meals. Dogs, both domestic and wild, act as reservoir hosts for this pathogen and are the primary hosts of brown dog ticks. Brown dog ticks become carriers of the pathogen when they take a blood meal from a rickessemic dog. Stored in the midgut and salivary glands of an infected tick, E. canis is transferred by the saliva of ticks carrying the pathogen to hosts during blood meals. If infected while in the larval stage, the tick retains the pathogen through the next two life stages and can infect hosts during blood meals in both the nymphal and adult stages in transstadial transmission. Because the vector of E. canis uses canine species as a primary host, this bacterium is most commonly associated with dogs, but multiple human cases have been reported. Additionally, some cats have been found to have antibodies to E. canis suggesting that it can occasionally infect cats, as well.  Pathogenesis  E. canis is a small, coccus bacterium with a single circular chromosome. Minute in size, E. canis is smaller than the other species in the genus Ehrlichia. The cell walls of this organism lack peptidoglycans and lipopolysaccharides typically present in at least small amounts in most other Gram-negative bacteria, which is believed to contribute to its ability to resist the immune response of the host. The lack of these two materials reduces the rigidity of the cell wall, allowing the cell wall‚Äôs exterior to be dynamic, in turn facilitating the E. canis cells‚Äô evasion of antibodies in its host organism‚Äôs body. The cells of E. canis lack complex internal structures, which allow the synthesis of sugars and it, in turn, uses amino acids as its source of energy. Upon introduction, E. canis penetrates the monocytes and macrophages of hosts. Infection may leave a host asymptomatic for months or severe clinical signs may manifest as ehrlichiosis develops.  Diagnosis and treatment  Animals infected with E. canis may experience a combination of signs, including fever, lethargy, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, edema of the appendages, discharge from nose and eyes, and seizures. A low packed cell volume in the blood is a common indicator of the presence of E. canis and a blood smear can be done to determine if morulae are present in leukocytes to definitively diagnose the infection. Because this process is often long and tedious, the presence of antibodies to E. canis in blood can be used to effectively diagnose a patient. These antibodies typically appear within seven days after infection. E. canis is commonly treated via chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline, a prescription drug used in the treatment of bacterial infections. If caught before the clinical stage, E. canis is almost completely curable, but prolonged presence of the bacteria leads to hemorrhaging, which typically results in the death of the patient. Although no vaccine is known to be on the market for ehrlichiosis caused by E. canis, extensive research on the use of an attenuated strain of E. canis as an aid in the prevention of E. canis infection is being performed. Preliminary testing has proved that this method may be effective, as clinical signs and the presence of the E. canis bacteria were reduced in Beagle test subjects, but further investigations are necessary before a vaccine can be marketed.

He was France's ambassador to the United States from 1926 to 1927. Early years Henry B√©renger was born on 22 April 1867 in Rugles, Eure. He was educated at the college at Dinan, the Lycee of Coutances, the Lyc√©e Henri-IV in Paris and the Sorbonne, where he obtained a B.A. He won an open competition in philosophy. In 1891 B√©renger published a noted study of Lavisse. In the 1890s he published poems inspired by Gabriele D'Annunzio in the journals l'Ermitage and La Conque. He was leader of a group called \\"Art and Life\\" that discussed subjects like symbolism, free thought, spirituality and socialism. He published several books, wrote in La D√©p√™che de Toulouse, and in 1903 founded the journal L'Action. He soon left L'Action and became in turn director of Le Si√®cle (1908) and Paris-Midi (1911). Political career Henry B√©renger won election to the Senate for Guadeloupe on 7 January 1912, and held this seat until 1945. He was a Radical Socialist, and joined the Democratic Left. He joined the Commission for Algeria. World War I began in July 1914. In August 1914 B√©renger proposed a law to regulate the press in wartime. He was a member of the Commission for economic organization of the country, and in 1917 submitted a bill for a law for civil mobilization and the organization of labor. He appointed Commissioner General for Gasoline and Combustibles on 21 August 1918 in the government of Georges Clemenceau. He retained this position in the government of Alexandre Millerand, until resigning on 23 September 1920. His policies ensured that France received 22.5% of the oil of Mosul, and influenced development of the French refining industry. In 1921 B√©renger was a member of the Finance Committee and the main mover for the law on control of expenses. He was elected rapporteur g√©n√©ral, holding this position until 1926 and increasing the influence of the committee in managing finance. He was appointed to the Foreign Affairs Committee in 1924. In August 1925 he was a parliamentary delegate on the Caillaux mission that went to Washington, D.C., to address the issue of debt between the Allies. In 1926 Aristide Briand appointed B√©renger Ambassador to the United States. His negotiations there led to the Mellon-Berenger Agreement for settling war debts. His collected speeches and articles on this subject were published in 1933. He continued to be involved in Belles Lettres, publishing articles in the Revue des deux Mondes and the Revue de Paris and directing the periodical Actualit√©s. B√©renger returned to France in 1928, and was charged by the Finance Committee with a report on the Foreign Affairs budget. As Vice- President of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on 12 November 1931 he and Joseph Caillaux questioned the government on the relationship between France and the Soviet Union. Soon after he became President of the Foreign Affairs Committee, holding this position until 1939. On 21 September 1932 he was also appointed nominal delegate of France to the League of Nations. Although hostile to fascism, he advocated a neutral position in the Spanish Civil War. He became increasingly outspoken against the regimes of Hitler and Mussolini. Under the first government of L√©on Blum (in office 4 June 1936 ‚Äì 22 June 1937) Th√©odore Steeg was appointed head of a commission to study socio-economic conditions in the French colonial empire. The North African sub-committee included other leading figures such as Paul Reynaud, Charles-Andr√© Julien and Paul Rivet. Meeting on 8 July 1937, this sub-committee decided to focus on labor conditions in the Maghreb. They were too late to prevent the escalation of widespread and violent labor unrest in the region, which was violently suppressed. B√©renger represented France as the principal delegate at the √âvian Conference in July 1938, organized to solve the problem of Jewish refugees from Germany. After the Munich Agreement he intervened with Georges Bonnet, Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the hope of now obtaining a resolution of the Jewish issue, but Hitler remained adamant. In June 1940, he abstained from voting over the delegation of powers to Marshal Philippe P√©tain. He retired to Saint-Rapha√´l, Var, where he died on 18 May 1952. He was an Officer of the Legion of Honor.

Chess Fever is a comedy about the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, made by Pudovkin during the pause in the filming of Mechanics of the Brain.Leyda 1960, p. 174. The film combines acted parts with actual footage from the tournament. Plot In Moscow during the world chess tournament of 1925, the hero (Vladimir Fogel) and heroine (Anna Zemtsova) of the story are engaged to be married. Caught up in a society-wide chess fever, the hero forgets about his marital obligations and must beg for her forgiveness. As he kneels before his dismayed fianc√©e on a checkered cloth, the hero becomes distracted and starts to play chess. Enraged, the heroine throws his chess themed belongings out of the window and forces him to leave. Now separated, the heroine finds herself at a pharmacy, intending to obtain poison to kill herself. Meanwhile, the hero dejectedly sits on a bridge above a river, throwing what's left of his chess possessions into the water. Rather than throwing himself off the bridge as well, he realizes the importance of love and resolves to find the heroine and apologize. It is at this time that the heroine raises what she thinks is a vial of poison to her lips. However, she is stopped when she realizes that she was mistakenly given a chess piece by the distracted chemist. The heroine's distress is interrupted by World Chess Champion Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, who tells her that, in the company of a beautiful woman, he too hates chess. The two become friends and drive off as the hero arrives. The hero, with nothing left to do but return to chess, attends the tournament. Looking into the crowd, he is shocked to find his fianc√©e excitedly watching the game. He runs to her and the two embrace, united by their love for chess, and the film ends with them playing the game together.

Pudovkin and Shpikovsky made this short silent comedy film in less than a month. It combines acted scenes with actual footage from the chess tournament occurring at this time and includes many cameos from Chess Champions and grandmasters. The film also features many Russian and Soviet film directors, such as Boris Barnet, Fedor Ozep, Yuli Raizman, and Yakov Protazanov.  Cultural Influence  Chess Fever influenced author Vladimir Nabokov's 1930 novel The Luzhin Defence, published in the United States as The Defense. There are parallels within the two works, such as the main characters' inward and outward dispositions and the central love story present in both. The hero in Chess Fever is similar to Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin, the protagonist in Nabokov's novel; both are oblivious and idiosyncratic in nature, with a similar attire of checkered clothing and high degree of self-absorption. They are overcome with their obsession of chess and have difficulty merging their romantic relationships with their love for chess. Pudovkin's short film is the basis for Nabokov's novel, which went on to be made into a film. See also *The Three Million Trial Footnotes References *.

Yaralla was the home of Eadith Walker and her father Thomas. The estate is historically significant as one of the last large nineteenth-century estates remaining in metropolitan Sydney. In the 1860s, Thomas Walker commissioned the architect Edmund Blacket to design a home on the shores of the Parramatta River. This Victorian Italianate mansion became the Walker family home. From 1893 to 1899, Eadith Walker built extensions that were designed by the architect John Sulman. A stables and coach house complex were also designed by Sulman at the same time. The entire estate is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/23 Dame Eadith Walker , who never married, died at Yaralla in 1937 after a long career devoting her life to the Australian Red Cross and a wide range of other philanthropic organisations. Her estate was disposed of in accordance with the terms of her father's will, brought about by the Thomas Walker Trusts Act (1939), a portion of which was set aside to found the Dame Eadith Walker Convalescent Hospital and income from the remainder went to support the hospital, the Thomas Walker hospital and the Yaralla cottages built by Dame Eadith for elderly people in need.  History  The Nichols era and the future Yaralla, 1797-1848 The core of the later Yaralla is the promontory in Concord between Majors Bay to the east and what is now Yaralla Bay to the west. The original name for Yaralla Bay was Nichols Bay, and this reflects that the entire promontory was included in a 50-acre land grant to Isaac Nichols in 1797. Nichols is a good representative example of the able and hard-working convict who successfully rehabilitated himself in the colony. He had been transported for theft and arrived in Sydney at the age of 21 in 1791. After he'd served time as an assigned convict in Major George Johnson's house, Governor John Hunter, impressed by the young man's ability and good behaviour, made him overseer of convict gangs in Sydney and, when his sentence expired in 1797, granted him 50 acres with Parramatta River frontage at Concord on 20 December, with two convict servants to work on the farm.Jack, 2005, 1 This would later become the site of Yaralla. Nichols bought 25 acres of land very close to the south from William Harrison for 9 pounds and presumably built huts at once at Concord for his two stockmen. He himself however, acquired an inn, the Jolly Sailor, in George Street in 1798 and soon developed business premises, a shipyard and a stone dwelling on the west side of Circular Quay. There is no evidence for a substantial cottage on Nichols' Concord farm in this early period. Nichols' advance in the colony suffered a setback when he was found guilty in 1799 of receiving stolen property. It seems likely that he was the victim of the monopolistic ambitions of the New South Wales Corps, with John Macarthur puling the strings, and Governor Hunter, deeply suspicious of the verdict, referred the case to England. Nichols' name was not cleared until 1802, when the new Governor, Philip Gidley King, was instructed by the British Government to grant him a pardon from the 1799 conviction. Thereafter Nichols became a person of increasing significance, appointed Superintendent of Public Works and the first post-master in 1809. For the first 4 or 5 years after 1797, Nichols used his Concord property for mixed farming. By 1801 he had cleared only 14 acres of the initial 50 acres and had 18 acres under wheat or maize. He had three horses and no draught oxen. His only other livestock in 1801 consisted of 50 hogs. Within a year he had cleared another 26 acres and was growing a substantial amount of wheat and a lesser amount of barley and maize at Concord. He had three assigned convicts and two free servants, not all necessarily resident at Concord, in 1802.Jack, 2005, 2 Nichols began to diversify. In 1803 he had a field of peas at Concord and began to plant fruit trees: by 1805 he had at least one peach tree bearing fruit. The extent and location of the orchard at this period are not known, although it can be assumed to have lain close to Yaralla Bay, where it is shown on the first available plan in 1833. He was also beginning to build up a herd of cattle and a flock of sheep. In 1805 the farm was attacked by Aboriginal people, who seized the stockmen's \\"little property and provision\\" and then \\"chased and dispersed the stock in all directions\\". Only one stockman was there at the time and he prudently fled the scene. Keenly aware of the value of land, he gradually purchased the surrounding lands. Nichols died in 1819 leaving the land in trust for his son George Robert Nichols. George Nichols interests lay elsewhere and in May 1836 he conveyed his interest in the estate to his brother Isaac David Nichols. The Nichols used the land for farming. During the late 1830s the brothers need for cash encouraged them to mortgage the property several times. The Walker era (1840-1937) In January 1840 George Robert Nichols mortgaged the land to Thomas Walker for 3500 pounds at 15%. In May 1842 he borrowed a further 900 pounds on the security of the property. None of that money was repaid to Walker. In the meantime the remaining title the mortgagor had over the land was conveyed to James Holt, a Sydney merchant. Walker initiated an Equity Court case against G. R. Nichols and James Holt in May 1843 after he was unable to gain repayment of the loan or obtain possession of the land which constituted the security for the loan. In August 1848 the court awarded title to the land to Walker when neither Nichols or Holt could repay the land. Walker was a strong critic of the Land Acts of the 1860s which established the principle of free selection before survey. He was a substantial stock owner and had also invested heavily in the pastoral industry. He spent a period as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, representing the Port Phillip electorate (which later became the state of Victoria), and as the president of the Board of the Bank of NSW. Walker was also an active philanthropist. However, despite his commitment to relieving the poor, he had a hatred of the democratic element in society and was firmly aligned with the view of keeping the poor in their place. Initially Walker did not move to Concord. However, he ensured the estate was carefully maintained although the gardens and orchards had already fallen into ruins. This was possibly in the 1840s when the Nichols family may have seen little need to maintain an asset which they were in danger of losing particularly while his residence was being planned and built in the 1850s. Around 1857 architect Edmund Thomas Blacket drew up a set of plans for a cottage at Concord for Thomas Walker, cottage meaning a small country residence. Construction of this cottage, (an Italianate villa) to be known as Yaralla, began. Although the date of completion is not certain, it is probably around 1858‚Äì1859. This is also probably the time that Walker moved onto the property permanently. The house was built in 2 stages. Construction began in 1851 using stone quarried on the property and was completed in 1864.Howard & White, 1995, 4 Thomas Walker married Jane Hart in 1860 and their only daughter was Eadith Campbell Walker. Jane died in 1870 and Thomas Walker did not remarry. He arranged for his sister Joanna Walker to come to Australia and care for Eadith. Joanna adopted Anne Masefield to serve as a companion to Eadith. Scottish gardener Alexander Grant was born in 1845 at Cullen, Scotland and served an apprenticeship in the gardens of Cullen House in Banffshire. Before migrating to Australia in 1878 he followed his profession in several Scottish gardens, including the Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh. Grant arrived in the colony in 1878 and worked first at Yaralla, Concord for the Walkers for some considerable time, then at Rosemont, Woollahra for Alexander Campbell MLC, then for Mr Tooth at the Swifts, Darling Point, which he planned and laid out. There is no record of where Grant was living while working at Yaralla and Rosemont, though from 1881 he lived at \\"Willow Cottage in Point Piper Road - west side (later Ocean Street), Paddington\\" until he moved to quarters in the Botanic Garden, Sydney in 1882 for work there. It is likely that the positions at Yaralla and Rosemont both included quarters for a single man and that only after he married Margaret Stevenson in January 1880 was he obliged to find alternative accommodation (Willow Cottage).Grant, 1997 When her father died in September 1886 his estate was valued at 937 984 pounds. He left his estate to his daughter, Eadith Walker, but a portion was left to set up the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital. In 1890 his sister Joanna Walker also died, leaving Eadith, who never married, to live the life of a wealthy spinster. Eadith remained living at Yaralla for the rest of her life. She lived alone though surrounded by staff, and during her lifetime she enlarged Yaralla considerably, also building several cottages for retired staff on the property. Prior to World War I, Eadith had 25 servants and employees living at Yaralla, including a butler, nine maids, cooks, laundresses, chauffeurs, four gardeners, poultry and dairymen, a housekeeper and an engineer who looked after the power station and provision of water. With Anne now married to architect and planner John Sulman, and construction of the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital complete, Eadith and Sulman now turned their attention to Yaralla and planned extensive additions and alterations. These were built between 1893 and 1899.GML, 2011, 13 Eadith Walker commissioned Sulman to design additions which were finished in 1899. Eadith took the opportunity to enjoy herself, but her activities were tempered with a strong streak of benevolence. She contributed financially to the Thomas Walker Convalescent Home and was an active member and contributor to many charitable institutions including further finance for the Thomas Walker Convalescent Home. Eadith was fond of animals and involved with their protection. An indication of her affection for her own pets was manifested in the private pet cemetery located within the grounds of Yaralla, where her animals were laid to rest.GML, 2011, 15 For a short time, between 1912 and 1914, Yaralla became the residence of the Governor-General of Australia. It was while staying at Yaralla that the Governor General, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar, received a cabled warning of the approach of World War I. Fond of travel, Eadith Walker made a number of trips overseas, bringing back enormous quantities of souvenirs. She bought back enough artefacts from India to require the construction of a special Indian room in Thomas Walker's former office. The Norwegian Cottage, and most of its fittings and furniture, also returned with her from another sortie. It was later re-assembled in the grounds of Yaralla. The Norwegian Cottage was a product of Eadith's fondness for travel. She brought it back from a trip and had it reassembled on the grounds. The Indian Room was built to house all the artefacts she brought back after a trip to India. This was not the only building to take place during her life at Yaralla. Extensive renovations were made to the estate during the 1890s. These additions and alterations were designed by architect John Sulman, who was married to Eadith's childhood friend, Anne MasefieldKass 1995: Appendix 1 The alterations to the main house included a new marbled floor entrance hall overlooked by a balcony, a panelled dining hall with a marble and bronze fireplace, an upper storey on the back and extensive balconies on the front. A set of brick and tile stables adorned with square towers, ranging rooflines, gables and a cupola with weathervane were also built.R.Howard & D.White, 1995: 5 Eadith maintained Yaralla as a feudal estate and the property contained four bulls, eleven cows, one horse and a quantity of poultry. The paddocks formed an important part of the Estate's rural function from its beginning, providing grazing area for the cattle and horses used in farm activities. Cattle were shown at the Sydney Royal Easter Show and provided milk for the Estate and area for the horses used when buggies were the main form of transportation. The eastern section of the western paddock has been used for housing.Howard & White, 1996, Inventory of Landscape Precincts, L5 & L6 Others simply came to visit, including the powerful and wealthy, regal and vice-regal personages and political figures. Among these were the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII and subsequently the Duke of Windsor who spent a week in Yaralla in 1921. Knowing his liking for squash, Eadith had a court built for his visit, possibly the first in NSW. Estate workers lived in cottages and were employed in various tasks. These included gardening and maintaining the dairy herd. However, it was a shrinking estate. The Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital took over a whole peninsula (to Yaralla's west) in the 1890s and in 1917, a sizeable piece of the estate at the head of Major's Bay (to Yaralla's south-east) was transferred to the Concord Golf Club Ltd. During the First World War she assisted sick and wounded servicemen through the Red Cross and eventually established and maintained a recuperative facility for tubercular veterans in the grounds of Yaralla from 1917 until January 1920. However, she did not restrict herself to these philanthropic activities and regularly held parties for Sydney society members at the estate. In 1919 the outer part of the estate closest to Concord Road was transferred to the real estate firm King and Humphrey. King and Humphrey offered the first sub-division of Yaralla Estate in June 1920. A large crowd bid for all lots offered until dusk, necessitating a further auction later. Eadith Walker's benefactions, donations to the Thomas Walker Convalescent Home and construction work at Yaralla took a toll on her finances. The grounds were extraordinary and a lot of time and money had gone into establishing large areas of lawn with native and European trees, rockeries, walks, fountains, ornamental urns and statues, grottos, hot houses, a conservatory, rose gardens and more than a dozen cottages. A power plant the size of a small factory was built, reputedly Sydney's first private generating plant and the Sulman alterations undertaken. At her death in 1937 the estate totalled 265 345 pounds, less than a third of what her father left behind. The Arthur Walker Reserve to the Estate's south adjoining Majors Bay has been home of the Concord West Cricket Club since 1940 and indicates the patronage of Dame Eadith Walker to local community organisations. Eadith was patron of the club (giving land for their first pitch in 1921 near the railway station, their second near Thomas Walker Hospital and this land in 1935). The Reserve is used predominantly for matches and training and in winter as soccer training ground. The general public also use it for recreation. It is managed by Canada Bay Council and the majority is Council-owned (c.90 %). A small portion on the north eastern side remains a part of Yaralla /Dame Eadith Walker Estate. Eadith lived in a suite at The Savoy Residential Apartments in Darlinghurst in her later years before returning to Yaralla to die. She died on 8 October 1937. Soon after much of the furniture, fittings, cars, art works and books were sold at a giant auction conducted by James L. Lawson, leading auctioneers in association with Francis de Groot. Dame Eadith Walker Convalescent Hospital (1937-1988) Eadith Walker made several generous bequests in her will and left half of the residue of her estate to trustees for charitable purposes. The Walker Estates ActNo 31, Geo VI, 1938 enabled trustees to purchase Yaralla and its grounds to establish a convalescent home for men, which was vested in the state government. Royal Prince Alfred Hospital was given control of the hospital, to become known as the Dame Eadith Walker Convalescent Hospital, and it was transformed into a Sub-acute Diseases Hospital where patients from the main hospital at Camperdown were sent to recuperate. It was officially opened on 29 June 1940. The Estate became vested in the Crown under The Walker Trusts Act, 1938 as the Dame Eadith Walker Convalescent Hospital (Yaralla Estate), to be controlled, managed and operated as convalescent and rehabilitation hospitals under the terms of Thomas Walker's will. Sections 19 and 19A of the Walker Trusts Act 1938 provide for the overall control, management and administration of the Yaralla and Rivendell Estates, respectively. The Yaralla Estate is the largest community bequest of its era (c.37ha) to survive in an intact form in NSW. The NSW Department of Health (Sydney South West Area Health Service: SSAHS) is the present Crown authority responsible for the control, management and administration of the property. During the 1970s many of the buildings were demolished and the swimming pool filled in. As late as 1970 the estate was still in the form in which it appeared in the 1930s. In November 1988 the Dame Eadith Walker Convalescent Hospital was closed. 1988-present: Health- related uses and public parkland Since 1988 the estate has remained in use for health-related purposes, managed by the Sydney South West Area Health Service (now the Sydney Local Health District). These have included use of the main house as a Renal Dialysis Training Centre Unit (1993‚Äì2008) and of Magnolia Cottage as the Kalparrin Day Centre, a day care unit for patients with dementia (2003+). The main mansion was used for some years as a kidney dialysis unitbefore being refurbished c.2011 as a Palliative Care Unit. This unit incorporated a 20-bed sub-acute inpatient palliative care unit and clinical and non-clinical support services and associated infrastructure. This unit continues to provide services for persons with HIV, Dementia and other conditions.Rappoport, 2015, 10 On 28 August 2013, the NSW Department of Health announced by media release that 13ha of Yaralla's estate would be made public parkland. The Yaralla Estate Community Advisory Committee was established in late 2013. Its role is to advise the Chief Executive of the Sydney Local Health District on maintaining and using the estate for the benefit of the Local Health District and the community. It has a defined role and terms of reference, including advising the Trustee in developing and reviewing its plans and policies for the estate, monitoring and evaluating uses of the estate, maintaining and promoting the integrity of the heritage values of the estate. In November 2016, the refurbished gate house, Hyacinth Cottage hosted its first family of a burns patient to live in, while remaining close to Concord Hospital for follow-up care. Concord Hospital is part of the NSW Statewide Burns Injury Service, with many patients coming from regional, rural, remote and overseas locations for specialised care. The refurbished Hyacinth Cottage residence allows the Burns unit to discharge eligible patients, encourage them to continue their recovery in a supportive home environment and ensure they continue to have access to multidisciplinary care.Yaralla Estate Update, November 2016, 1: Sydney Local Health District)  Description  Estate The Dame Eadith Walker Estate comprises approximately 37 hectares (Sydney South West Area Health Service state the area as 50 acres/20.3haSSWAHS., 16/5/17 of land, comprising a peninsula fronting the Parramatta River at Concord. It is a large estate which retains its rural elements such as grazing fields with horses, former orchard and vegetable garden areas (now lawn), extensive garden layout including parkland, rose garden, picking garden, extensive grotto work, a rockery, former tennis/croquet lawn, former swimming pool (in-filled and now lawn) and Italian lawn terrace. It also contains sporting and recreation facilities, such as the former swimming pool, tennis court/croquet green and a squash court. The Estate is made up of a number of clusters of farm and service buildings and structures. The grounds in their heyday were extraordinary and a lot of time and money went into establishing large areas of lawn with a rich range of native and European trees, rockeries, walks, fountains, ornamental urns and statues, grottos, hot houses, a conservatory, rose gardens and more than a dozen cottages, scattered across the grounds. Unlike the garden at its companion Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital (Concord, on the next peninsula to the west) which was purpose-designed for an institutional building, the garden at Yaralla was designed as a high maintenance domestic garden for social gatherings. Whilst a lack of maintenance has meant some regrettable losses - the now in-filled swimming pool, the lost Indian room and Norwegian house, it remains largely intact. Various conservation works to elements of the estate and garden have brought the garden and grounds to a high level of condition, considering the more constrained and focused use of resources of recent decades. Biodiversity Yaralla has natural and cultural heritage significance for its biodiversity, which includes introduced and native flora and fauna. It is an important element in the health of the Parramatta River Catchment and its site is of significance, given it includes three endangered ecological communities: Coastal Saltmarsh in areas of mangrove bordering the Parramatta River banks; Swamp-oak Floodplain Forest; and Sydney Turpentine- Ironbark Forest - the latter forming two areas of remnant bushland which are otherwise rare regionally. As well it has richly planted grounds, with a diverse mixture of introduced and native species of plants. These attract and provide food, fibre and habitat for an equally rich assortment of fauna, from microscopic: insects, soil fungi etc. to large and obvious: birds, possums, humans. ;Bushland areas The estate has two areas of remnant bushland which are otherwise rare regionally: * a) Swamp-oak Floodplain Forest (swamp oak being Casuarina cunninghamiana, river or swamp oak); and * b) Sydney Turpentine- Ironbark Forest (turpentine being Syncarpia glomulifera; ironbark being narrow-leaved ironbark, Eucalyptus crebra.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 30 November 2015 These bushland remnants and the mangrove community are home to numerous threatened fauna which depend on their conservation. Dame Eadith Walker Estate and Thomas Walker Estate were recently described as 'joint jewels in the City of Canada Bay's biodiversity crown' in a report by InSight Ecology (2014). This detailed report was a study of the indigenous fauna of the City of Canada Bay Local Government Area can be found on the City of Canada Bay Council's website and the Sydney Local Health District's Yaralla website. The City of Canada Bay Council also has reports on bush regeneration and vegetation management at Yaralla which can be accessed via the council. Some species that inhabit the Yaralla Estate include a spectacular array of birdlife including honey eaters, wrens, parrots and more, a variety of mammals and a rare remnant of the endangered ecological community, Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest.(InSight Ecology, at http://www.slhd.nsw.gov.au/Yaralla/flora.htm) Driveway The Drive, now a street in suburban Concord, once belonged to the Yaralla estate, running all the way west to Concord Road. Today's estate driveway runs from the intersection of The Drive and Nullawarra Avenue. The formal outer entry gates are iron, with stone pillars, and a palisade fence. One of the estate cottages sits on the northern side of the main gates, doubling as a gate house. An impressive entrance driveway avenue leads from Concord Road (it is now a suburban street called 'The Drive') and across into the estate east of Nullawarra Avenue. This is composed of brush box (Lophostemon confertus) (with the occasional eucalypt exception) and runs from the entrance gates between grassed west and east paddocks (still containing horses) leading to the inner set of gates, stables and parkland garden. Garden The estate contains a relatively intact Victorian and Edwardian layout and structure of a large suburban estate. It retains key elements including buildings and landscape, such as its fields, outer (informal) and inner (more formal) gardens, outbuildings, yards and working areas, cottages, terraces, power house, jetties, walks etc. The garden and grounds contain a rich array of Edwardian and Victoria era garden features, some in very good condition, some revitalised in recent years, some more neglected due to lack of maintenance. An inner set of iron gates and fence leads the drive past the elaborate brick stables/gate house (on the right /east) and into the garden, bordered by shrubberies on both sides and going past the rose garden (on its right/east) past the Dairy (former stables) and working yards and sheds (behind a hedge and shrubbery) to the house which is towards the estate's north-eastern side - closer to the tip of the peninsular. Mixed shrubbery borders lining both sides along and the central island within the inner drive (within the inner set of gates) are richly planted with a mixture of old fashioned shrubs, small trees, succulents, some dramatic such as variegated Mauritius hemp (Furcraea selloa 'Variegata'), bulbs and perennials. A rare tropical trumpet creeper climber, Distictis buccinatoria grows over a frame near the rose garden. Underplantings have been revived and some replaced in the 1990s including widespread use of Nile/African lilies, (Agapanthus orientalis). To the south of the house is a service yard and outbuildings. A carriage loop lies west of the house's main entrance facade, which is crowned by an Italianate tower. Next to (to the left of) the house's entrance front the verandah gives onto a broad path and lawns reaching down to the north to clumps of giant bamboo from which a broad grassed walk, bordered on its higher side with elaborate concrete grotto-work, leads from the site of the jetty round the shore line to a shelter house also of concrete grotto-work beside the site of the swimming pool (now filled and grassed over). Steps amid further grotto-work lead to an upper (croquet or tennis?) lawn overlooked by an Italianate balustraded terrace (east of the house), with formal flower beds and fountain, before the third (east) front of the house (and the site of the Indian room, demolished 1972), and conservatory). A bay window on the house's eastern facade looks into this Italianate garden, with Indian pines, urns and terracing. The grotto on the lower lawn area where formerly was a semi-natural swimming pool, is perhaps the largest in Australia, and contains a rich collection of plants, including and featuring palms, cycads, xeriphytes such as pony tail palms (Nolina sp.), rare species of climber/trailer such as Trachelospermum sp., rare succulents such as Euphorbia grandidens, other unusual succulents such as Agave and Aloe spp., etc.Source: RNE, and pers. comm. Stuart Read, 2002, updated 16/12/11 A picking garden area lies south- west of the rose garden, hedged, but is not kept up. It is now grassed, giving little indication of the intensity with which it would once have been planted, pruned and maintained. Some random NSW Christmas bushes (Ceratopetalum gummiferum) pruned into coppices give a slight hint of its former use. These would have been cut for table arrangements. The rose garden has been moved slightly south of its original position due to mature trees shading the original area. It is south-west of the house, plumbago-hedged (Plumbago capensis), is formally planned with a sandstone sundial and two \\"crinkle\\" wire trellised curved \\"cylinder\\" arbours running along the sandstone flagged \\"crazy\\" paved paths. This garden was replanted in the 1990s. The garden contains much maturespecimen and border tree and shrub planting on a grand scale - clumps of giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa) near its \\"water gate\\", trees such as Himalayan/deodar cedars (Cedrus deodara), Araucaria pines, Queensland kauri pines (Agathis robusta), Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), several funeral cypresses (Cupressus funebris), remnant indigenous turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera), various palms (such as Washingtonia robusta - California desert fan palm; Howea forsteriana - the Lord Howe Island palm), bird of paradise 'trees' (Strelitzia nicolai), the rare gunstock tree (Scolopia braunii) near the house's service courtyard, desert wilga (Geijera parviflora), various orchid trees (Bauhinia x variegata), camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Himalayan chir pines (Pinus roxburghii) east of the house, etc. It also contains a number of old- fashioned flowering and evergreen shrubs, such as a rare hybrid coral tree (Erythrina x camdeni 'Bidwillii') just inside the inner set of gates, Chinese hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis cv.), oleanders, (Nerium oleander cv.s), Indian hawthorn (Rhaphiolepis delacouri), sweet box (Murraya paniculata) and also herbaceous plants, such as star jasmines (Trachelospermum - several species, some rare - e.g. on the grotto), succulents (especially on the grotto), etc.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 2005, 2012 The sunken garden north-west of the house was replanted in the early 1990s with predominantly dwarf mondo grass but retains its form and intended character. Buildings Major buildings on the site include:- ;Yaralla Yaralla is a large asymmetrical two storey Victorian Italianate building with a 4-storey tower over the front door, smaller octagonal towers at its corners, verandahs and projecting bay windows at corners. It has an Indian influence to the verandahs. Ornamentation is confined to balconies and verandahs, including simple mouldings. ;Jonquil Cottage - Single storey Californian Bungalow style dwelling with a series of gabled roofs and prominent entry porch and tall chimneys.

The roof tiles are terracotta and the walls brick with cement render and timber to the gables. The windows are framed with timber and stone flagging leads to the court. The courtyard is paved in sandstone blocks. Elaborate timberwork lines the horse boxes. ;Laundry and substation block Two storey structure with gabled roof, chimneys and decorative fretted bargeboards and belfry on the eastern wall. The roof has terracotta tiles with a metal ridge and the brick walls are rendered and coursed to resemble stone. The inside walls are rendered and the ceilings and floors are constructed with timber.

Sheds and animal (pig, chicken and fowl) enclosures are generally roofed with terracotta tiles and have walls of timber or brick constructionR.Howard & D.White 1995: 27  Condition  The building was reported as being in good condition externally and internally as at February 2009.HG/GAO, 2/2009 Unlike the garden at Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital, designed for an institutional building, the garden at Yaralla, designed as a high maintenance garden for social gatherings, has suffered from its later/more recent use and lack of maintenance. The available maintenance makes it impossible to present the garden in the style for which it was designed, although with the exception of the architectural features, the Norwegian house and the Indian Room's regrettable losses - and that of the now infilled swimming pool, the layout appears quite intact. The European archaeological potential was assessed as good as at 1 January 1993, while the Aboriginal archaeological potential was assessed as poor.

Heritage listing  The Dame Eadith Walker Estate is of outstanding cultural significance for NSW. It comprises a unique complex of 19th- and early 20th- century buildings in an essentially rural landscape setting and is an exceptionally rare complete example of a large Edwardian private residential estate in Australia and one in close proximity to the city. The estate has direct historical links with the early days of the colony of NSW and is strongly associated with an important mercantile and philanthropic family. The estate contains an exceptional group of late 19th-century buildings, some of them rare examples, which clearly demonstrate the workings of a farm of this period. Its core is a substantial Italianate villa designed by Edmond Blacket & John Sulman and also of architectural and historical significance for its associations with Thomas Walker, a prominent Australian. It is of great significance for its landscape, as an intact estate on the Parramatta River, with extensive mature mangroves fringing the shore and mature plantings in an extensive but deteriorated garden. The estate has a large collection of rare and important trees and shrubs, many over a century old, some of individual botanical and horticultural significance and rarity as well as herbaceous and climbing plant specimens. Whilst not of exceptional design, as a component of the estate the garden with its extensive late Victorian or Edwardian grotto- work, picking, flower garden and entertaining areas is of much interest, and demonstrates a lost way of life. Yaralla Estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Dame Eadith Walker Estate is a unique complex of buildings and landscape elements which is of outstanding significance as a large, self-sufficient private residential estate and has a strong association with an important mercantile and philanthropic family of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Yaralla House represents the work of two of Australia's major 19th-century architects, Edmund Blacket and John Sulman. It is evidence of changing living patterns during the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. The Estate is significant in the evolving pattern of the colony starting as a grant to an ex-convict, through to a colonial gentleman's residence and early 20th-century residence of an important philanthropic woman, Dame Eadith Walker. The Estate is also important evidence of early settlement in the Concord area.R.Howard & D.White 1995: 29 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The group of buildings comprising the Dairy Complex, Stables Complex, Boronia Cottage, Magnolia Cottage, Pig Enclosure, Chicken Enclosure and Fowl Enclosure are architecturally consistent and unified with strong visual, physical and historical links. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Dame Eadith Walker Estate has botanical and scientific significance as a large collection of rare and important trees and shrubs on a large residential estate, many having existed in this location for over a century. A number of specimens have individual botanical importance for their rarity. Many archaeological remains exist on the Estate which have the potential, through archaeological analysis, to provide further information on the cultural heritage and lifestyle of the previous occupants of the Estate. The existence of the foundations of demolished buildings is significant in that they provide physical evidence of the location of previous structures and add a dimension to the interpretation of the site as a whole. The group of buildings comprising the Dairy Complex, Stable Complex, Boronia Cottage, Magnolia Cottage, Pig Enclosure, Chicken Enclosure and Fowl Enclosure, form an exceptional group of late nineteenth- century buildings which clearly demonstrate the workings of a farm of this period. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Contains rare examples of particular structures and is an exceptionally rare example of a large Edwardian private residential estate in Australia.(R.Howard & D.White 1995: iv) The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Dame Eadith Walker Estate is representative of a large suburban 19th-century estate, with relatively intact Victorian and Edwardian estate layout and structure, key elements including buildings and landscape including fields, more natural areas and a large garden. The estate is also representative of the pattern of estate accumulation and to a lesser extent subdivision, and the change from a rural or semi-rural to a suburban setting over the 20th century. The garden is representative of large, 19th- and early 20th-century gentry estate gardens, with a range of features including sporting facilities, swimming pool, grotto, sunken garden, rose garden, picking garden and a large collection of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. It is also representative of gentry estates which were used for social occasions, such as parties and gatherings, playing a role in the wider community as well as for estate workers and their families.

Currently, Capozzi works for the Office of the Chief Technology Officer of the District of Columbia as a Project Manager.  Political History  Prior to his election as Shadow U.S. Representative of the District of Columbia, Capozzi was involved in organizing protests in front of the Rayburn House office building in support of DC Statehood. He met with a number of Congresspersons prior to the 1993 vote for DC Statehood, the only vote of its kind to be held by the House of Representatives. As the Shadow Representative, Capozzi worked with the Reverend Garyland Ellis Hagler and Council member William Lightfoot in pointing out Fannie Mae, then the largest private sector company in DC, was exempt from paying DC corporate income taxes. As a shareholder in the company, Capozzi sponsored a s shareholder's initiative to have the company make a payment, in lieu of taxes, to DC. In 2002, at Capozzi's initiative, the DC Council debated a proposal to change the District's flag in protest of DC's lack of voting rights in Congress. The new design would have added the letters \\"D.C.\\" to the center start and the words \\"Taxation without Representation\\" in white on the upper and lower bars, the format already used on District licence plates. The change, presumably, would have been temporary and revoked once the city achieved equal representation or statehood. Capozzi's proposal was passed by the council by a 10‚Äì2 vote, but the final design was never adopted.  Green Home in Hillcrest  In August 2009 Capozzi made headlines in a local publication, East of the River. The former shadow Rep was highlighted by reporter, Gerri Williams in an article called 'A Green Home in Hillcrest'.East of the River Capozzi and his wife Sue built the first Green Home located in the South East region of Washington, D.C. The solar concept was not new to Capozzi, who worked for the DC government‚Äôs Office of the Chief Technology Officer.Capital Community News Green Power Advocacy In 2010 Capozzi, as an active DC SUN member, filed a shareholder resolution with Pepco to force the company to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions from products and operations.

The community is made up of nine Dominican sisters. They dedicate their lives to constant prayer with one of them always present in the chapel. They receive many letters, telephone calls, faxes and e-mail with prayer requests. The mother superior of the monastery (Mother Mary Martin as of 2008) Ali, G. and Ali, M.

They then tell the other sisters about the important things happening outside the cloisters. The sisters are separated from the outside world by a grate. This divides them from the guests who visit them, from the priest who celebrates Mass for them, and even from the relatives who come to visit them on certain days. Daily life in the convent is similar to that in other cloisters throughout the world. The sisters typically make bread, cakes, sweets, hosts and wine for the parishes. These products are placed near a small opening where people come to pick them up. When Archbishop Joseph Cordeiro became archbishop of Karachi in 1958, he invited a community of contemplative nuns to the diocese. In December 1959, nine nuns from the monastery in Los Angeles arrived in Pakistan to found the monastery in Karachi. On July 20, 1968, the convent was moved from Ingle Road to its current location in the Landhi area of Karachi. Fr. James deSouza was the first Chaplain of the Monastery. Later when he became the Rector of the St. Pius X Minor Seminary he used to send his young Seminarians to help the sisters whenever they had some difficult work like cleaning of the Retreat House, a special planting project in the garden, or other heavy jobs. The sisters in turn supplied them with home ‚Äì made jam, bakery goods, and fruits and vegetables from their garden. On December 20, 2009 the Monastery will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its beginning in Pakistan. However, there has been no one joining their number in ten years.

John disaster At the time of the Titanic disaster on April 15, 1912, Franklin was in charge of the White Star Line office and terminus affairs at IMM headquarters in New York City. Upon hearing about the ship's sinking via wireless messages, he did not at first assume the worst, saying in a statement to worried relatives and friends of the ship's ill-fated passengers and press reporters crowding outside the White Star Line offices at around 10:30 PM that night, \\"There is no danger that Titanic will sink. The boat is unsinkable, and nothing but inconvenience will be suffered by the passengers.\\" Later, at about 11:30, he insisted, \\"We hope that reports from the Virginian and the Parisian will prove to be true, and that they will turn up with some of the passengers...\\" (Other than those already aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia) But, by midnight, Franklin admitted the seriousness of the situation, saying in a statement, \\"I thought her unsinkable, and I based my opinion on the best expert advice.

The primary architect of these early mergers was C. W. Ruth.\\"Historical Statement\\", Manual of the Church of the Nazarene 2005-2009 (Kansas City, MO: Nazarene Publishing House, 2005):21. First General Assembly Phineas Bresee sought to return to John Wesley's original goals of preaching the good news of the gospel to the poor and underprivileged. The First General Assembly held in Chicago, Illinois from 10‚Äì17 October 1907 brought together the Eastern and the Western streams. The Western group was the Church of the Nazarene founded in October 1895 in Los Angeles, California by Dr. Phineas F. Bresee, a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, and Dr Joseph Pomeroy Widney, a Methodist physician, and the second president of the University of Southern California. The Eastern group was the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America, a denomination formed on 13 April 1897 through the merger of two older bodies: The Central Evangelical Holiness Association (organised 13‚Äì14 March 1890) and led by Fred A. Hillery and C. Howard Davis; and three churches organised by William Howard Hoople since January 1894, and formed into the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America. On 12 November 1896, these two groups met in Brooklyn, agreed upon a plan of union, which included retaining the name and Manual of Hoople's group.Watchword, 62. Prominent leaders included Hiram F. Reynolds, Davis, and Hoople.\\"Historical Statement\\", Manual of the Church of the Nazarene 2005-2009 (Kansas City, MO: Nazarene Publishing House, 2005):19. At the time of its merger with the Church of the Nazarene in 1907, the APCA existed principally from Nova Scotia to Iowa and the northeastern United States. The name of the united body adopted at the First General Assembly was Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene, and Bresee and Reynolds were elected the first general superintendents. Interim accessions In April 1908 Bresee accepted Edgar P. Ellyson, president of the Holiness University of Texas of Peniel, Texas, his wife, Mary Emily Ellyson (1869‚Äì1943), and many leaders and members of the Holiness Association of Texas into the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene, with Emily Ellyson elected pastor of the new congregation at Peniel.Watchword, 157. In September 1908 the Pennsylvania Conference of the Holiness Christian Church under the leadership of Horace G. Trumbauer merged with the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene.Manual 2005-2009, 22. Second General Assembly At the Second General Assembly held at Pilot Point, Texas, the Holiness Church of Christ, located in the southern United States, merged with the Pentecostal Nazarenes. The Holiness Church of Christ itself was the merger of the New Testament Church of Christ founded in July 1894 at Milan, Tennessee by R.L. Harris, but soon led by his widow Mary Lee Cagle,Manual, 19. and a group (also called the Holiness Church of Christ), that resulted in November 1904 at Rising Star, Texas from the prior merger of The Holiness Church' (founded in 1888 in Texas) and the Independent Holiness Church (formed at Van Alstyne, Texas in 1901, and led by Charles B. Jernigan and J.B. Chapman).Manual, 19-20. The merger of the Holiness Church of Christ in the south and the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene took place on Tuesday, October 13, 1908, at 10:40 a.m., \\"amid great shouts of joy and holy enthusiasm.\\"Historical Reflections of God at Work The newly merged Church of the Nazarene began with 10,034 members, 228 congregations, 11 districts, and 19 missionaries, according to historical records.Early Church of the Nazarene Stats The latter date marks the \\"official\\" founding date. Bresee, Reynolds and Ellyson were elected general superintendents. Later accessions Other independent bodies joined at later dates, including the Pentecostal Church of Scotland (founded in 1909 by Rev. George Sharpe) and the Pentecostal Mission (founded in 1898 by J.O. McClurkan), both in 1915. At this point, the Church of the Nazarene now embraced seven previous denominations and significant parts of two other groups. In time, the Church of the Nazarene and the Wesleyan Church would emerge as the two major denominations to gather in the smaller bodies of the 19th century Wesleyan-holiness movement. In subsequent decades, there were new accessions and mergers. In the 1922, more than one thousand members and most of the workers led by Joseph G. Morrison, from the Laymen's Holiness Association (founded in 1917) located in the Dakotas, joined the Church of the Nazarene. In the 1950s, there were mergers with the Hephzibah Faith Missionary Association (founded in 1893 in Tabor, Iowa) in 1950; the International Holiness Mission (founded in London in 1907 by David Thomas) merged on 29 October 1952; the Calvary Holiness Church (founded in Britain 1934 by Maynard James and Jack Ford), united on 11 June 1955; and the Gospel Workers Church of Canada (founded in Ontario in 1918) became part of the Church of the Nazarene on 7 September 1958. On 3 April 1988, an indigenous Church of the Nazarene in Nigeria, established in the 1940s, merged with the denomination.Manual, 22-24. The 2009 General Assembly authorized a committee with \\"the responsibility to approach \\"like-minded churches in the Wesleyan-Holiness tradition in order to pursue closer relations, with a goal of exploring the possibility of a merger or a collaborative relationship.\\"\\"Legislative Actions and G.S.

In 1961 Pitts returned to the Philippines as an independent missionary, funded largely by the First Church of the Nazarene in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where his brother, Paul Ernest Pitts (born 6 May 1904 in Haleyville, Alabama; died November 1969 in Lake Charles, Louisiana), a former superintendent of the Alabama District (1938‚Äì1942), was the pastor.Jones, 1463; Long Hair, 2. Joseph Pitts was subsequently dropped from the roll of elders of the Church of the Nazarene,Long Hair, 2. and in December 1961 Pitts incorporated the Holiness Church of the Nazarene, with himself as chairman and Encarnacion as vice- chairman.Watchword, 418.

Crusaders Churches of the United States of America (1972) After the Church of the Nazarene decided at the 1972 General Assembly in Miami, Florida to allow those who had remarried after divorce to be church members, Rev. E.O. Jack Jones, who had spoken against the resolution at the General Assembly and subsequently surrendered his ministerial credentials, and his supporters established the Crusaders Churches of the United States of America later in 1972, with its headquarters in Urbana, Illinois, and Faith in the Future as its official periodical.Jones, 799. Fellowship of Charismatic Nazarenes (1977) \\"One of the most divisive issues in the Church of the Nazarene in the 1960s and 1970s was speaking in tongues.\\"Cunningham, 442. For an extended discussion of Pentecostalism and the Church of the Nazarene, see 442-448. The Church of the Nazarene's historic prohibition on glossolalia was challenged increasingly by Nazarenes influenced by the Charismatic Movement that originated in the USA in the 1960s. At the 1972 General Assembly each delegate received a packet of materials advocating a charismatic revival in the denomination and for an acceptance of tongues-speaking members.Cunningham, 445. When Charismatic Nazarenes failed to have the denomination relax its position at both the 1972 and 1976 General Assemblies, and in light of \\"strongly worded\\" statements by the Board of General Superintendents in 1976, the Fellowship of Charismatic Nazarenes was formed in Kansas City in 1977, with Warren Black (born 27 November 1927 in Bethany, Oklahoma), a former accountant at the Nazarene Publishing House, who had been \\"ousted from his Church of the Nazarene pulpit\\",\\"Charismatic Meet Shows Some Dissent\\", Spokane Daily Chronicle (25 July 1977):2.

Black indicated in a 1977 interview that he knew of fifty Nazarene ministers \\"who had been put out because of receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit. The church takes a very intolerant position about it\\".\\"Charismatic Meet Shows Some Dissent\\", Spokane Daily Chronicle (25 July 1977):2. In 1985, the Wesleyan Holiness Charismatic Fellowship was formed with Wilbur L. Jackson, a former Nazarene pastor from Cincinnati, Ohio its initial leader. Both groups work co- operatively.Jones, 508, 781. Gold Creek Community Church (2012) Gold Creek Community Church was a large congregation in the Church of the Nazarene that left the denomination to be an independent non-denominational church in 2012. Its ministers were removed from the role of ministers by the action of the Washington Pacific District Assembly on April 15, 2012. The church had 2,428 members when it separated from the denomination. International growth Former International Headquarters of the Church of the Nazarene, Kansas City Even before the merger of October 1908, the parental bodies of the Church of the Nazarene had a vision to be an international denomination. International expansion began in India in 1898 by missionaries sponsored by the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America.Manual Church of the Nazarene 2005-2009:24. By 1908, there were churches in Canada and organized work in India, Swaziland, Cape Verde, and Japan, soon followed by work in central Africa, Mexico, and China. The 1915 mergers added congregations in the British Isles and work in Cuba, Central America, and South America. There were congregations in Syria and Palestine by 1922. General Superintendent Reynolds advocated \\"a mission to the world,\\" and support for world evangelization became a distinguishing characteristic of Nazarene life. Taking advantage of new technologies, the church began producing the Showers of Blessing radio program in the 1940s, followed by the Spanish broadcast La Hora Nazarena and later by broadcasts in other languages. From the 1940s through the 1980s, indigenous holiness churches in other countries continued to join the church. At the time of the 50th anniversary of the denomination in October 1958, a total of 19.8% of all Nazarenes lived outside the continental United States.Purkiser, Called 2, 224, http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyctr/books/2601-2700/HDM2623.PDF In 1981 the figure was 28.3%.Called 2:224. In late 1991 there were one million members of the denomination globally, with 43% living outside the USA.Watchword, 511. By 2000 the church's membership was just under 1.4 million, with the church's membership outside the USA doubling in the previous decade, and now comprising 53% of total global church membership. In June 2009, 64 percent of Nazarene members and 80 percent of the church's 429 districts are outside the United States.\\"Middendorf Delivers 'A Future of Hope' Quadrennial Address\\", , http://www.nazarenemedialibrary.org/MediaView.aspx?mediaId=9ab0e0e0-0888-44fa-8007-03edf0075c04 More than 20% Nazarenes are from Africa, and more than 20% Nazarenes speak Spanish as their first language.Watchword, 512. In 2009, the church is located in 155 \\"world areas\\" (approximately equivalent to nations).World Areas . For a map illustrating both the world areas and regions of the Church of the Nazarene, see At the 2009 annual meeting of the General Board, it was decided that the denomination would enter the following new nations: Guinea-Conakry (Africa Region), Niger (Africa Region); Moldova (Eurasia Region), and Norway (Eurasia Region).NMI Prayer Mobilization Line for February 24, 2009. Each week Nazarenes worship in more than 212 languages or tribal languages, with literature produced in 90 of these. The Church of the Nazarene reaches out to persons around the globe through the Internet, radio broadcasts in 33 languages, and video and printed materials in 95 languages. In 2008, there were 794 General Board-funded missionaries (active, retired, regional, Mission Corps volunteers, and \\"tentmakers\\") for the Church of the Nazarene. These missionaries originate from 26 world areas. In 2008, 508 Mission Corps (formerly Nazarenes in Volunteer Service) volunteers, including 23 \\"tentmakers,\\" ministered in 51 world areas.Louie E. Bustle; http://www.nph.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=10006888 Internationalization Developments (1907-1932) The primary architect of Nazarene mission philosophy and practice was Hiram F. Reynolds, who had served as the foreign missionary superintendent in the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America (APCA) from its earliest years, and held a similar role in the Church of the Nazarene (under various titles) from 1907 until 1922.Watchword, 245. Influenced by the indigenous church mission theories of Anglican Henry Venn (1796‚Äì1873) and American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions secretary Rufus Anderson (1796‚Äì1880), from the beginning of the global expansion of the Church of the Nazarene (including its antecedent groups), there was a commitment to the development of indigenous churches and districts within the framework of a unitary global denomination under the authority of the Manual.Charles R. Gailey, \\"Internationalization in the Church of the Nazarene\\", Paper presented to the Association of Nazarene Social Researchers (c.1987):2-3, http://www.nazarene.org/files/docs/Internationalization%20in%20the%20Church%20of%20the%20Nazarene.pdf ; Watchword, 249. As early as 3 March 1914, Nazarene mission policy developed for the work in Japan by Reynolds encouraged the creation of \\"self-supporting and self-governing churches\\": > When a Mission Church reaches a place where it can become entirely self > supporting it shall be organized by the District Missionary Superintendent > (SIC) Into a self supporting body according to the manual of the Pentecostal > Church of the Nazarene adapted to the needs peculiar to the country, and > shall be governed by the same. The church shall be granted a pastor whose > duties and privileges (SIC) shall conform to the manual; and at this time > all missionary control shall be relinquished except such superintendency as > provided for in the manual.\\"The Policy of the General Missionary Board of > the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene to Govern the Work in Japan\\", 3 March > 1914, quoted in Gailey, 2. Under the policy, foreign districts would be granted the same rights as US districts, with control passing from missionaries to local leaders.Gailey, 2. However, in 1919, all reference to the missionaries relinquishing control was removed, and the following substituted: \\"The pastor and delegates from the self-supporting church to the District Assembly must be able to enter into the deliberations of the Assembly in the English language until such time as a self-supporting district may be formed.\\"\\"Policy of the General Missionary Board of the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene to Govern Its Work in the Foreign Fields\\", quoted in Gailey, 3. Developments (1922-1964) Gailey indicates, that by 1932 these policy statements had been broadened to full \\"three-self\\" language, with the instruction to missionaries to cultivate among local Christians \\"...self support, self leadership and responsibility for the propagation of the gospel in that field.\\"\\"Policy of the General Board of the Church of the Nazarene To Govern Its Work In Foreign Fields\\", Kansas City, Missouri, 1932 (Nazarene Archives):14, quoted in Gailey, 3. The \\"language was unchanged for the next twenty years, and has remained essentially intact until the present time.\\"Gailey, 3. By the 1930s, Nazarene missions leaders \\"did not aim toward the development of autonomous national churches, but a federation of districts. They did not plan for indefinite missionary control. Without a great deal of thought about where this would lead, without consciously copying any other denomination's model of church government, and without much theological reflection, the Church of the Nazarene became an international body.\\"Watchword, 257-258. The first non-missionary district superintendents were George Sharpe (born in Scotland in 1865; died 1948) in Britain (November 1915) and Vicente G. Santin (1870‚Äì1948), appointed district superintendent in Mexico in 1919.Watchword, 181, 184, 253. In January 1936 the General Board divided the declared the Japan District into two, and the Western or Kwansai district became the first regular district in the denomination, \\"with all the rights and privileges of any of the North American and British Isles districts subject to the Manual and the General Assembly,\\"Watchword, 257. however the effects of World War II on the church in Japan saw it revert to a missionary- led district. Developments (1964-1980) According to one denominational historian, W.T. Purkiser, the process of \\"internationalizing\\" the church began at the General Assembly in Portland, Oregon in 1964 with an eight-year study of the church's total missionary program.\\"Purkiser, Called 2:234. Soon after that General Assembly, E.S. Phillips was elected Executive Secretary for World Missions, who encouraged the self-study. In this period, a think tank comprising R. Franklin Cook, a former missionary to India and member of the World Mission department since 1961; missiologist Paul Orjala, pioneer missionary to Haiti; and Honorato Reza, long-time representative for the Hispanic church, was formed to advise Phillips.Gailey, 4. They were responsible for developing the denomination's first \\"National Church Policy\\" that was adopted in 1966, and indicated explicitly for the first time the steps towards achieving \\"regular\\" district status.Gailey, 4-5 At the General Assembly of 1972, held at Miami Beach, Florida, Phillips, influenced by the recommendations of the preceding self-study, recommended in his report that \\"The administrative bodies of the church must be internationalized....That portion of the church that lives overseas...must be given full voice in the councils of the church.\\"Watchword, 525-526. Phillips advocated contextualization of the gospel and internationalization of denominational programs and structures.Watchword, 526. It was only in 1972 that the General Secretary began to include overseas membership in reporting totals, as prior to this time it had been difficult to collect the needed data.Purkiser, Called 2: 317. In 1973 Phillips died, and was succeeded by former missionary to Germany Jerald Johnson (born 1916). In 1974 the Guatemala Northeast district achieved regular status, the first since Japan achieved this milestone in 1936Watchword, 513. Also in 1974 the Nazarene Young Peoples Society (now Nazarene Youth International) in its desire to be more inclusive, held its first International Institute (now Nazarene World Youth Conference) on the campus of European Nazarene Bible College in B√ºsingen, Germany. At the 1976 General Assembly held in Dallas, Texas, a Commission on Internationalization was created to recommend \\"means by which the next stage of internationalization might be implemented.\\" In 1976, concrete steps were taken to make possible an international church with the creation of three intercontinental zones outside the USA and Canada: Intercontinental Zone I (Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Intercontinental Zone II (the Orient and South Pacific); and Intercontinental Zone III (Central and South America).Watchword, 525; however Purkiser indicates it was in 1972, see Purkiser, Called 2:224. In 1977 the General Board had eight members (18%) from outside the USA among its 44 members.Purkiser, Called 2:226-227. In 1978 the first international district superintendents' conference was held in Kansas City, Missouri, with 52 leaders from 35 nations represented. At the 1980 General Assembly, held in Kansas City, the denomination formally committed itself to the process of internationalization, a deliberate policy of being one church of congregations and districts worldwide, rather than splitting into national churches like earlier Protestant denominations. The principle was set forth of ‚Äúone church, one doctrine, one polity, and one policy.‚Äù At that time, the entire denomination was divided into fifteen geographical regions, with eight in the USA based around its regional college; one in Canada; and the three Intercontinental Zones subdivided into six regions: Africa; Asia; Europe and Middle East; Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean; South America; and the South Pacific.Purkiser, Called 2: 225. The General Board now included members from outside the USA, Canada and the other parts of the British Commonwealth. In 1980 the General Board had fourteen (27%) out of its 51 members residing outside the United States and Canada. Developments after 1980 After the election of Jerald Johnson as a general superintendent in June 1980, the General Board elected L. Guy Nees as his replacement.Watchword, 516-517. During his six years of leadership, Nees appointed directors for each of the six missions regions, who supervised the establishment of administrative offices in each region.Watchword, 517. The 2nd Commission on Internationalization recommended that regional directors should be born in the region. The 1985 General Assembly allowed \\"cultural adaptations of local, district, and regional church government procedures\\", approved the creation of regional advisory councils and conferences, and national administrative boards.Watchword, 528. In 1989 the 3rd Commission recommended that the Church of the Nazarene should be a \\"denomination of districts (not nations)\\", and that districts and regions should follow geographical rather than racial or ethnic lines. The 1989 General Assembly stated three principles for internationalization: \\"(1) shared mission; (2) national identity; and (3) indigenization\\"; prohibited districts being constituted on the basis of ethnicity; explicitly rejected the idea of a commonwealth or federation of the denomination, in favour of it being a \\"global family\\"; and created a Commission on the International Church.Watchword, 529. In 1999 incoming professor of missions at Nazarene Theological Seminary Mario Zani indicated that the biblical concept of koinonia, the fellowship \\"that transcended any differences, assignments, or titles\\", should be the basis of the development of the Church of the Nazarene. Zani critiqued the idea of internationalization as being too predetermined and focused on strategies and administrative policies, whereas he advocated the denominational goal should be globalization, which he defined as \\"that process by which we become sensitized and responsive to the multi-cultural, multi-lingual, multi-ethnic, and multi- national world of which we are a part.\\"Mario Zani, quoted in Watchword, 531. Zani concluded that though the Church of the Nazarene was \\"international from its conception, it was not truly global.\\"Watchword, 531. By the 2001 General Assembly, held in Indianapolis, 42 percent of delegates present and voting were not native English speakers. Today 64 percent of Nazarene members and 80 percent of the church's 429 districts are outside the United States. However, General Secretary David Wilson reported that at the 2009 General Assembly that 562 delegates present and registered were from the USA and Canada (55 percent) and 461 delegates were from other world regions (45 percent). As many elected delegates from outside the United States could not attend the General Assembly due to financial, US immigration policies or other reasons, the General Assembly authorised the creation of \\"a committee to address the concern that a high percentage (as many as 40 percent in some world regions) of non-North American/non-United States delegates are unable to attend a General Assembly\\". Since the Church of the Nazarene's quadrennial General Assembly is based on representation from districts from 151 world areas, the 2009 General Assembly was probably one of the most racially and linguistically diverse general meetings of any religious body that originated on American soil. At the 2009 General Assembly the delegates voted to create a global Manual that would be streamlined in comparison to recent Manuals, consist of the Foreword, and Parts I, II, and III of the current Manual, and would also include parts of the Manual that are global in scope, retaining the universally appropriate polity and principles.\\" The General Assembly authorised the different regions to adapt the Manual to fit specific cultural contexts and would function as a \\"regional Manual policy handbook.\\" For the quadrennium starting July 2009, the General Board currently had 44 members representing the church's 15 regions, and an additional four members were elected to represent Education (2), Nazarene Youth International, and Nazarene Missions International. Of the 48 members elected, 27 (56%) are from outside the USA, and 21 are US citizens. Five are women.\\"General Board Members: 2009-2013\\", Nazarene News (9 July 2009); http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=10007318 ; \\"General Board Vacancy Filled\\", Nazarene News (13 August 2009), http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?sid=10000023&id;=10007416 References Further reading History * Chapman, J.B.

He served as Bishop of Scranton from 1899 until his death in 1926. Early life Hoban was born in Waterloo Village in Byram Township, New Jersey, to Patrick and Bridget (n√©e Hennigan) Hoban, who were Irish immigrants. He and his family later moved to Hawley, Pennsylvania, where he received his early education. He entered St. Francis Xavier's College in New York City at 14 and then attended Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1868 to 1871. Education After caring for his widowed mother for over two years, he briefly studied at St. John's College in Fordham, New York, before enrolling at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, Pennsylvania, in 1874. In 1875, he was sent to further his studies at the Pontifical North American College at Rome. Priesthood While in Rome, Hoban was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta on May 22, 1880. Upon his return to Pennsylvania in July 1880, he served as a curate in Towanda until 1882, when he was transferred to Pittston. He received his first pastorate in 1885, being appointed to St. John's Church at Troy. In 1887, he was named pastor of St. Leo's Church in Ashley, where he established a church and rectory. Bishop On February 1, 1896, Hoban was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Scranton and Titular Bishop of Alalis by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 22 from Archbishop Francesco Satolli, with Bishops Thomas McGovern and Thomas Daniel Beaven serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Cathedral. He later succeeded William O'Hara as the second Bishop of Scranton upon the latter's death on February 3, 1899. During his 27-year-long tenure, Hoban presided over a period of great growth in the Diocese of Scranton. At the time of his succession in 1899, the diocese contained 152 priests, 100 parishes, and 32 parochial schools; by the time of his death in 1926, there were 341 priests, 202 parishes, 65 parochial schools, and three colleges. His tenure was also marked by a growing ethnic divide in Northeastern Pennsylvania. This culminated in a schism of Polish Catholics after their appeal to Rome were rejected. The leader of the Polish Catholic faction in the diocese, Father Franciszek Hodur led this schism. The actions of Bishop Hoban however, prevented the schism from reaching even greater proportions. The schism may well have avoided in its entirety, had a kinder view of the Polish immigrants been taken. Hoban died at 73. He is buried at the Cathedral of Scranton.Rev.

The lyrics were written by Day and the music was written by musical composer Jed Whedon, who also directed the music video. Background When interviewed at San Diego Comic-Con, Day attributed her inspiration for the song to 1980s and 1990s-style dance music. She conveyed an obsession with Stacey Q's \\"Two of Hearts\\" in particular, which is apparent with Day including a familiar \\"come on, come on\\" in the lyrics. The song includes a rap portion performed by Guild co-stars Jeff Lewis and Sandeep Parikh. While Day composed the lyrics herself, whilst listening to \\"really bad 1990s dance songs\\", she turned to screenwriter Jed Whedon (with whom she had worked on internet musical Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog and TV series Dollhouse) to compose the music. Whedon and his wife Maurissa Tancharoen are credited as backup singers on the video, and Tancharoen also contributes her talent as a back-up dancer; this was the first time Whedon (who also directed the video) had seen her dance. Music video The music video features the entire cast of The Guild dressed up as their own online \\"avatar\\" characters from the web series. Day comments that \\"In a regular Hollywood situation it would have cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars\\", but the video was recorded in Whedon's closet three weeks prior to its general release. Whedon stated that in directing the video (his first time \\"directing anything\\" according to his wife) he \\"basically wanted to do a relatively clich√© dance video as if it were about medieval fantasy warriors who took themselves really seriously,\\" in which respect he felt the cast delivered \\"perfectly and hilariously\\". He used stop motion techniques to compensate for those members of The Guild cast who do not have dancing skills. Then, to make it \\"legit\\" as a video, Whedon made sure to include \\"actual sexy footage of Felicia, stellar dancing with Amy [Okuda] showing off her chops, and of course, raining money.\\" Jeff Lewis describes himself as \\"not good at anything at all - dancing or rap\\" and comments, \\"they were able to make what I did [the rap sequence] fairly entertaining\\". Lewis recorded four lines of rap at Jed's house which were later synced up to the video. He was told to dance or \\"do anything\\" for three minutes, which \\"felt really bad and embarrassing... awful\\" but was impressed when the footage was slowed down, and became \\"more than I anticipated or imagined in a music video.\\" Reception The video reached 1 million YouTube hits in less than 2 days. By April 2012‚Äî33 months after release‚Äîthe YouTube video had 19,710,073 hits, averaging around 600,000 hits a month. On August 6, 2010 the song became a playable track on Rock Band 2 via the Rock Band Network. BBC entertainment reporter Mark Savage describes the song as \\"[r]eminiscent of Ace of Base's 'All That She Wants'\\" and describes the rap by Jeff Lewis and Sandeep Parikh as \\"intricate and clearly masterful\\". TV writer, director and producer Joss Whedon (brother of composer Jed Whedon), who has worked with Day on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dr. Horrible and Dollhouse, gave his support for the song. On weblog Whedonesque.com, Whedon implored his fanbase to support the video, saying \\"I really want this to be big. It's indie (which is the most important part), it's awesome... So help me out. Let's go the extra mile here and DESTROY THE SWIFTBOT!\\" References External links *\\"(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar\\" music video on YouTube Category:2009 singles Category:2009 YouTube videos Category:Works about video games Category:2009 songs ","title":"(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar"},{"id":"24027267","title":"List of VFL/AFL minor premiers"},{"id":"24027275","text":"Early parliamentary elections were held in Moldova on 27 February 1994.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St√∂ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1330 They were the country's first competitive elections, and followed deadlock in Parliament over the issue of joining the Commonwealth of Independent States.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1317 The result was a victory for the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova, which won 56 of the 104 seats.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1342 Electoral system In 1993 a new electoral law was passed,Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1320 which removed the right to vote from serving members of the military, whilst removing the right to run for election from all members of the military, the judiciary, the police force, national security services and prosecutors.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1321 A special Central Election Commission was formed by the Supreme Court, consisting of the five judges in the Court and one representative of each party or alliance.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1322 Parliament was elected by proportional representation in a single national constituency.

The short colour description given is probably enough to identify it to be the same as Nembrotha rutilans (Pruvot- Fol, 1931).

Sea Slug Forum, accessed 10 December 2009. Description Nembrotha purpureolineata is a large pale-bodied dorid. Although the ground colour is a creamy white, this is mostly hidden by a large brown patch which covers most of the notum. Brown stripes usually run down the sides of the body and a brown band is found around the head and anterior part of the mantle. The rhinophores are red to orange-red. The foot is usually edged with purple, though this may only be rather faint. It may reach a total length of 120 mm. This species is easily confused with Nembrotha aurea and Nembrotha chamberlaini. All three species have a similar range of colour variation although N. aurea often has orange patches not present in Nembrotha purpureolineata.

Bray's publications evidence his deep understanding of the Brahui language, and his later work on Shakespeare re-arranged the much disputed argument on the basis of the discovery of a hitherto unexpected rhyme-link or word-link, joining sonnet to sonnet to form an orderly and smoothly flowing whole. Early life Bray was born in Aberdeen when his father, the Rev. Thomas William Bray, a Church of England cleric, was serving a cure in the Scottish Episcopal Church. He grew up there and in England and Germany, and was educated at a Realgymnasium in Stuttgart, Blundell's School in Tiverton, and at Balliol College, Oxford (where he was Taylorian Scholar). Diplomatic career Bray passed the Indian Civil Service examination of 1898, and served in the Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Baluchistan. After serving as Deputy Secretary of the Foreign Department at New Delhi for four years. Bray was appointed Secretary in 1920, and filled the position with distinction for nearly a decade. He had a large share in shaping the treaty with Afghanistan negotiated at Kabul by Sir Henry Dobbs in 1921 (which amended the Treaty of Rawalpindi, agreed originally in August 1919, and reaffirmed Britain's recognition of Afghanistan's complete independence, and restored to the Afghans the privilege of importing munitions through India). King Amanullah‚Äôs impatient forcing of Western ways on his people after visiting Europe in 1928 led to a revolt, and grave danger to the inmates of the British Legation at Kabul. Early in 1929, Bray was responsible for the plans for the evacuation by air (a novel method at that time) of the women and children, and then of the Minister, Sir Francis Humphreys, and his staff as part of the Kabul Airlift. On leaving India in 1930, Bray was appointed a member of the Council of the Secretary of State for the India Office, which was transformed before the completion of his seven years into a body of advisers. Throughout the time, he was on the Indian delegation to the annual Assembly of the League of Nations. Bray also represented India at the international broadcasting conference in 1936, at the diplomatic conference on terrorism in 1937, and in the mission to Spain on refugee relief in 1938.

History It was built between 1838 and 1845 by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont, and demolished in 1901. It was, according to the architectural historians Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry \\"an extraordinary design, entirely clothed in colonnades\\",Pevsner, 1991 edition, p.744 but in the opinion of Bernard Coleridge, 2nd Baron Coleridge was \\"a monstrous Italian house\\". The stable block, also designed in a neoclassical style, survives and is managed as a holiday let by the Landmark Trust. Construction Pre-1901 photograph of Silverton Park, south front viewed from the south-east Silverton Park was built by George Wyndham, a British naval officer who retired from the service in 1825. In 1836, his uncle, George Wyndham, the 3rd Earl of Egremont died, leaving only illegitimate children; George therefore inherited the Egremont title, although the Egremont seat of Petworth House in Sussex and the ancestral wealth passed to the 3rd earl's eldest son. George set about building a grand mansion in 1838 using the architect James Thomas Knowles. At the core of the new building was an older house called Combesatchfield, which Knowles surrounded with classical features, constructed in brick with a render of patented, metallic cement. A frieze depicting the Exodus of the Israelites into Egypt was sculpted on the external cornice. The interior was richly furnished. A classical stable block was built alongside the house. George borrowed heavily and increased rents to pay for the hugely expensive project and died, heavily in debt, in 1845. Destruction and later use Surviving stable block Silverton Park was uncompleted when George Wyndham died; his widow died in 1876 but attempts to sell the property failed. The contents were sold off in 1892, and in 1902 the house was demolished, although the stable block was converted for agricultural use. The surviving stable block, is according to Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry a \\"monumental pedimented composition around a courtyard\\" built \\"in a severely Grecian style\\".Pevsner, The Buildings of England: South Devon, Harmondsworth, 1952, p.263 It is the only surviving remnant of the house and was acquired in 1987 by Sir John Smith, founder of the Landmark Trust who sought to prevent it being converted into flats. In 2004, with the financial assistance of private donors, the Landmark Trust started its restoration for use as self-catering holiday accommodation, completing the project in 2008. Art forgeries The art forger Shaun Greenhalgh and his father acquired a copy of the 1892 sale catalogue and used the un-illustrated catalogue descriptions to recreate items, for which the catalogue was used to provide spurious provenances. Their most notorious forgery supported by this false provenance was the so-called \\"Amarna Princess\\", made in the Amarna art style of ancient Egypt, which they sold in 2003 to Bolton Museum for ¬£440,000, but were subsequently unmasked as forgers.

Fresh has recorded for over 100 independent record labels, including major labels Sony UK, Virgin, BMG UK, and Harthouse Germany. He is also founder of the record labels Howlin' Records, Electric Music Foundation, and Analog. Fresh had two international hit records in the UK, \\"Badder Badder Schwing\\" (featuring Fatboy Slim) and \\"What It Is\\". Fresh has performed in clubs, as well as festivals, including Glastonbury Festival, Creamfields Festival UK, Reading-Leeds Festival, and Jazz and Groove Festival. Early life Fresh was born Frederick Schmid, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. Career In addition to a growing U.S. audience, Fresh was also one of the few contemporary non-Detroit musicians of the techno/electro genre to receive a strong European following. His records for Experimental, Harthouse and Martin \\"Biochip C\\" Damm's Anodyne label were evidence of his popularity in Europe and also strengthened his international presence. Although Fresh's releases included tracks in hip hop, house music, techno and trance music, his musical essence exists in the electro and breaks subgenres. Although Fresh grew up listening to gothic rock and new wave, a trip to the Bronx, New York, U.S. in 1984 introduced him to the hip hop scene. Fresh began collecting DJ tapes (Shep Pettibone and Marley Marl) and records from the Jonzun Crew, Newcleus, Liquid Liquid, Cerrone, Shannon and Cat Stevens. Fresh's first studio recording was released on Boogie Down Productions, with Fresh remixing a track for The Man & His Music Dedication album for Scott La Rock. Fresh then constructed his own studio, collecting numerous analog and modular synthesizers as part of the building process. In 1992, after releasing debut singles on Nu Groove and Experimental, Fresh's first record label, Analog Recordings, was formed in late 1992, and grew to include numerous imprints: Analog UK, Butterbeat, Electric Music Foundation, Socket and Boriqua. The label and its offshoots have since attracted Thomas Heckman, Tim Taylor, Cari Lekebusch, DJ Slip, the Bassbin Twins, and Biochip C. In 1995, Fresh signed a contract with German techno label Harthouse Records and his second full-length album, Accidentally Classic, was released by the label's UK arm in late 1996 ‚Äì a Harthouse U.S. reissue was later released. His third album, The Last True Family Man, was released on the Eye Q label and resulted in two international chart hits, \\"Badder Badder Schwing\\" (featuring Fat Boy Slim) and \\"What It Is\\". The recordings peaked at number 34 and number 63, respectively, in the 1999 UK Singles Chart. Several singles and a mix album followed, until 2001's release, Music for Swingers. Fresh subsequently issued numerous albums on Howlin Records. In the late 1990s, he formed the record label Against The Grain with then-partner Krafty Kuts. Fresh also released records through the Wisconsin, U.S.-based Drop Bass Network and the German label \\"Electrecord.\\" In 2000, Fresh also formed a collectors label specializing in vinyl 45 singles, called \\"Howlin' Records\\", and released over 35 singles and four albums through the label. The catalog of Howlin' Record includes \\"Have Records Will Travel,\\" \\"Outstanding in His Field,\\" \\"Diggin' Up Ghosts,\\" \\"Surrounded By Funk\\" and Howlin' Greatest Hits. In 2004, Fresh released the reference book entitled Freddy Fresh Presents The Rap Records, which covers the history of the early independent \\"old school\\" rap scene, and provides an extensive catalog of rap releases from 1979 to 1989. The book was featured in The Source, Vibe, The New York Times and Village Voice, and won journalism awards in the U.S. ‚Äî it is recognized as the only reference book on the subject. Fresh released the updated second edition, with over 740 pages and more than 2,500 color photographs. In 2008, Fresh released the updated Freddy Fresh Presents The Rap Records Book Revised Edition that contains thousands of full-color photos from the independent rap scene. In 2014, Fresh taught DJ techniques at the McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota. He began work on his next album, Play The Music, with a launch of various singles starting with the song \\"Hardcore Rocka\\" done with Andy Ictus feat. Jamaica reggae stars Tanto Metro & Devonte with a video released in October 2014.

Football career Littlehales was born in Wellington, Shropshire and started his football career with Wolverhampton Wanderers, before joining Stoke in August 1892. On 26 April 1893, he was part of the Stoke team which visited the County Ground to play a friendly match against Southampton St Mary's. Even with the future founder of football in Brazil, Charles Miller playing at outside-left, the \\"Saints\\" were \\"outplayed fairly and squarely on every point\\", losing 8‚Äì0. Despite the result, it was reported that the spectators \\"thoroughly enjoyed the exhibition\\" and looked forward to witnessing \\"more matches of a similar character\\" in future. Also playing for Stoke were Charles Baker, Lachie Thomson and Willie Naughton, all of whom were to move to Southampton within two years. In 1894, Southampton St Mary's were one of the nine founder members of the Southern League, which had been created to enable clubs in southern England who were not admitted to the Football League, to play competitive football on a regular basis. For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including Baker, Littlehales and Thomson from Stoke and Fred Hollands from Millwall. Prior to the start of the new season, Littlehales was interviewed by the local sporting weekly, \\"Southern Referee\\" ‚Äî although he confessed to knowing little \\"from actual experience\\" about any of the Southern League opponents, he did not \\"expect to lose much; not down here at any rate. I'm certain we shall make them all go\\". He made his Southampton debut in their inaugural Southern League match, a 3‚Äì1 victory over Chatham played at the Antelope Ground on 6 October 1894. Described as \\"clever on the ball and the owner of a hard shot\\", Littlehales was ever-present in the League as Saints finished the 1894‚Äì95 season in third place. In the FA Cup, Saints reached the First Round proper for the first time, where they were drawn against Nottingham Forest, going down 4‚Äì1 to the Football League First Division side. In the 1895‚Äì96 season, Littlehales missed only one League match, scoring four goals with Saints again finishing in third place. As in the previous year, they also reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup, where they again met Football League opposition when they were defeated 3‚Äì2 by The Wednesday. Littlehales missed three matches at the start of the 1896‚Äì97 season, with Harry Haynes taking over. He returned on 7 November, playing at centre-forward, scoring twice in an 8‚Äì3 victory over New Brompton. He retained his place for the rest of the season, scoring five goals as the Saints claimed the Southern League title for the first of six occasions over the next eight years. Littlehales was ever-present in the FA Cup where the Saints reached the Second Round proper, losing 3‚Äì1 to Newton Heath after a replay. Littlehales' final match for the Saints came in the first match of the 1897‚Äì98 season, a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Tottenham, following which he lost his place to new signing Arthur Chadwick. In January 1898, he was rewarded with a benefit match against Eastleigh and retired at the end of the season. In his three full seasons with the Saints, Littlehales had made 68 appearances, including 17 in the FA Cup, scoring 12 goals. Following his retirement, he settled in the Bevois Town area of Southampton and died in the city on 18 November 1942.

It is an affluent northern suburb of Atlanta.  Geography  East Cobb is roughly bounded by: * Cherokee County to the north * Willeo Creek and Roswell in Fulton County to the northeast * the Chattahoochee River and Sandy Springs in Fulton County to the southeast * Bell's Ferry Road, I-575, and the Marietta city limits to the west, and * Interstate 285 and the Cumberland/Galleria edge city at the southern tip. No part of East Cobb technically falls within incorporated city limits. East Cobb consists primarily of unincorporated areas near Marietta, and a significant portion of unincorporated area near Roswell, as defined by United States Postal Service ZIP codes (though Roswell itself was in Cobb until 1932). A small sliver of an unincorporated area near Atlanta is in the extreme southern tip near Vinings, and a portion of the northwest is in an unincorporated area near Kennesaw (30144). ZIP codes that are associated with this area are (30144), (30188), (30062), (30066), (30067), (30068), and some of (30075). East Cobb does not fall within any census-designated place, but within the Northeast Cobb census county division. History Small communities, many established early in the area's post-Cherokee history, include Mount Bethel (located in present day central East Cobb), Shallowford Falls, Sandy Plains, Noonday, Blackwells, and Westoak. The area was developed as a suburb of Atlanta beginning in the 1960s. The \\"city\\" of Chattahoochee Plantation, which never had a city government, was established along the river by the Georgia General Assembly entirely to prevent Atlanta from annexation in 1961, and was officially abolished in 1995 along with dozens of other Georgia towns with defunct governments. Incorporation as a city In contrast to other northern suburbs of Atlanta, East Cobb has remained unincorporated. The idea of incorporating East Cobb as a city was suggested in 2009 by the organization \\"Citizens for the City of East Cobb\\". Yet the first serious discussion of incorporating East Cobb was initiated in 1998 by then Cobb County chairman Bill Byrne. Under Byrne's proposal, the city's boundary lines would be drawn by the Cobb Legislative Delegation, the county government would continue to provide water, sewer, police and fire services to the city for a nominal fee of one dollar per year, and the city would be governed by an elected mayor and five City Council members, with wards drawn by the Cobb Delegation. However, Byrne was defeated by Cobb County Chairman Incumbent Tim Lee, who dismissed the idea of incorporating East Cobb as \\"solution looking for a problem.\\" In March 2019, Matt Dollar, a local representative in the Georgia House of Representatives announced that he would be submitting a bill to create the legislation necessary for East Cobb cityhood. The bill could not be approved by the legislature or by referendum until 2020. If East Cobb were to incorporate as a city, it would be the largest in the county and the second largest in metro Atlanta (behind Atlanta), with around 150,000 residents. Economy Shopping Merchant's Walk is a open-air shopping center with retailers, restaurants, and a movie theater originally built in 1976 and since expanded and twice renovated, once in the early 1990s and again in 2008‚Äì2011. The East Cobber newspaper called the center the \\"heart\\" of the East Cobb community.\\"Merchant's Walk makes changes\\" , East Cobber, 2012-01-19 Tenants include Cook's Warehouse, Kohl's, Stein Mart, PetsMart, ULTA Beauty, Old Navy, Whole Foods Market, Marlow's Tavern, and SEED Kitchen & Bar, as well as a movie theater. The center is located at the intersection of Johnson Ferry and Roswell Roads. East Cobb Library was once located in Merchant's Walk; it has since relocated to Parkaire, a nearby strip of stores on Johnson Ferry Road. The Avenue East Cobb is a open-air shopping center at 4475 Roswell Road anchored by a Bed Bath & Beyond and Michaels arts and crafts store. It has a horseshoe-shaped form and a \\"period-style Main Street design\\" and \\"town square\\" concepts, according to its designers. Paper Mill Village is a collection of 33 buildings linked by over a mile of pedestrian walkways. The Village includes retail tenants, restaurant tenants, and service provider tenants. The village also hosts a monthly food truck night from April‚ÄìOctober each year on the last Monday of each month.  Culture  A popular community event is the Taste of East Cobb, held annually. The YMCA operates the McKlesky Family-East Cobb YMCA at 1055 East Piedmont Road. East Cobb park is a popular recreational area for the community. The community is also home to a civic association, a Kiwanis Club, and a Rotary Club. The paper-only weekly East Cobb Neighbor has a circulation of around 44,000. East Cobb hosts several popular parks and outdoor recreation areas. These include: East Cobb Park Established in 2001, East Cobb Parks hosts two playgrounds, walking trails, a bandstand, picnic pavilions, and stream overlooks. https://www.eastcobbpark.org/pages/friends-history/. East Cobb Park is immediately adjacent to Fuller's Park, which hosts baseball fields, a football field, a playground, and an indoor gymnasium used for recreational activities (https://www.cobbcounty.org/parks/parks-and-nature/locations/fullers-park). East Cobb is home to some of metro Atlanta's largest churches. Johnson Ferry Baptist Church, located between Johnson Ferry Road and Woodlawn Drive, has roughly 7,500 members. Mt. Bethel United Methodist Church, located off of Lower Roswell Road by the Cobb County Government Center, has over 9,000 members. The Catholic Church of St. Ann is located at the corner of Bishop Lake Road and Roswell Road as well. East Cobb is also home to three centers of Jewish life: Chabad of Cobb, Temple Kol Emeth (Reform Judaism), and Congregation Etz Chaim (Conservative Judaism). Government Various neighborhood and subdivision community associations are represented within the overall East Cobb Civic Association, which promotes dialog between government and community organizations and seeks to shape county government policy and improve the community's quality of life. The United States Postal Service operates the East Cobb Post Office branch. Cobb County operates the East Cobb Government Service Center. The center contains a county Police precinct, a Cobb Fire and Emergency Services station, and a Tag (license plate) Office. East Cobb comprises districts 2 and 3 of the Cobb County Commission. Cobb County Public Library operates the East Cobb Library (formerly the Merchant's Walk Library).  Education  Public schools in East Cobb are part of the Cobb County School District. The area comprises several high school attendance districts: Pope, Sprayberry, Wheeler, Kell, Walton, and Lassiter. The western half of the Kell district lies outside of East Cobb. The extreme western portion of the Sprayberry district (the Town Center Mall area) also lies outside of East Cobb. The extreme southwestern and southern portions of the Wheeler district lie west of I-75 and south of I-285 respectively, thus excluding these small areas from being considered a part of East Cobb. The area known as East Cobb comprises the following middle school districts: Daniell, McCleskey, Simpson, Hightower Trail, Mabry, East Cobb, Dodgen, and Dickerson (small portions of the Daniell and East Cobb Middle School districts lie outside of East Cobb; a sliver of the eastern portion of the Palmer Middle School district can be considered a part of East Cobb).

It usually allows us to convert probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms into non-uniform polynomial-size circuits.  Example  Example: If every person likes at least 1/3 of the books in a library, then the library has a book, which at least 1/3 of people like. Proof: Suppose there are N people and B books. Each person likes at least B/3 of the books. Let people leave a mark on the book they like. Then, there will be at least M=(NB)/3 marks. The averaging argument claims that there exists a book with at least N/3 marks on it. Assume, to the contradiction, that no such book exists. Then, every book has fewer than N/3 marks. However, since there are B books, the total number of marks will be fewer than (NB)/3, contradicting the fact that there are at least M marks. \\\\scriptstyle\\\\blacksquare  Formalized definition of averaging argument  Let X and Y be sets, let p be a predicate on X √ó Y and let f be a real number in the interval [0, 1]. If for each x in X and at least f |Yof the elements y in Y satisfy p(x, y), then there exists a y in Y such that there exist at least f |Xelements x in X that satisfy p(x, y). There is another definition, defined using the terminology of probability theory. Let f be some function. The averaging argument is the following claim: if we have a circuit C such that C(x, y) = f(x) with probability at least \\\\rho, where x is chosen at random and y is chosen independently from some distribution Y over \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}^m (which might not even be efficiently sampleable) then there exists a single string y_0 \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}^m such that \\\\Pr_x[C(x, y_0) = f(x)] \\\\ge \\\\rho. Indeed, for every y define p_y to be \\\\Pr_x[C(x, y) = f(x)] then : \\\\Pr_{x,y}[C(x, y) = f(x)] = E_y[p_y] \\\\, and then this reduces to the claim that for every random variable Z, if E[Z] \\\\ge \\\\rho then \\\\Pr[Z \\\\ge \\\\rho] > 0 (this holds since E[Z] is the weighted average of Z and clearly if the average of some values is at least \\\\rho then one of the values must be at least \\\\rho).  Application  This argument has wide use in complexity theory (e.g. proving \\\\mathsf{BPP}\\\\subsetneq\\\\mathsf{P/poly}) and cryptography (e.g. proving that indistinguishable encryption results in semantic security).

Biography O'Reilly was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Patrick and Delia (n√©e Readdy) O'Reilly. After attending Spencerian Business College (1887-1888), he studied at St. Ignatius College (1889-1893) and St. Mary's Seminary (1893-1894) in Cleveland. He then furthered his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francesco di Paola Cassetta on June 4, 1898. In 1899 he earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology from the Propaganda University. Upon returning to Ohio, he served as a curate at St. John's Cathedral until 1901, when he became professor of dogmatic theology at St. Mary's Seminary. He earned a Doctor of Laws in 1909 from the University of Notre Dame. He was chancellor (1909-1916) and vicar general (1916-1921) of the Diocese of Cleveland before serving as pastor of the Church of St. John the Evangelist. On December 19, 1927, O'Reilly was appointed the third Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on February 16, 1928 from Cardinal Dennis Joseph Dougherty, with Bishops Joseph Schrembs and Bernard Joseph Mahoney serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure, he established seven parishes and fourteen schools in the diocese, despite the economic ravages of the Great Depression. However, the increased burden of responsibility took its toll on his health, and his tenure was correspondingly shortened. O'Reilly later died in Miami Beach, Florida, aged 65.

He was an organizer of the Pan-Aryan Conference.The Berlin Observer (US military occupation paper), May 31, 1946 Edmondson had roots that went back to the colonial days of Virginia and Maryland and was primarily of Scottish descent. He saw himself as a nonpartisan patriot and referred to himself as a \\"Native American\\". Career Edmondson had a 40-year career as a reporter, editor, author and publisher on economics. He began his career as a journalist in Cincinnati, Ohio working as a reporter for the Cincinnati Post. Later he moved to New York City and became a financial reporter for the New York Herald and the New York Mail and Express. While in New York he became aware of what he came to believe was the Jewish manipulation of America's economy and started an independent financial news outlet, the Edmondson Economic Service.Guide to the Hollis Godfrey papers At this time he also became friendly with Nazi propagandist Ulrich Fleischhauer and was a participant in the latter's Welt- Dienst/World-Service anti-Jewish news service. Edmondson believed President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be Jewish and published the flier Roosevelt's Jewish Ancestry to make his case. His attacks on Roosevelt during the 1936 election campaign suggested that the President was under the control of Jews such as Bernard Baruch, Felix Frankfurter and Louis Brandeis.Henry L. Feingold, A Time for Searching, 1995, p. 216 In a series of essays called American Vigilante Bulletins which eventually numbered over 400,John Roy Carlson, Under Cover, p. 146. Edmondson in the 1930s and 1940s documented what he saw as the Jewish control of America in banking, the press and the media. His research was the forerunner to Who Rules America? written and distributed decades later by Dr. William L. Pierce. In 1953 he republished some of his bulletins in a book, I Testify. Edmondson was also a strong anti-communist and much of his writing centered around the idea that fluoride in water was part of a communist conspiracy, as well as other plots attributed to communists.Hans Toch, The Social Psychology of Social Movements, p. 66. Trials On June 11, 1936 Edmondson was indicted by a Grand Jury in New York City and charged with \\"libeling all persons of the Jewish Religion.\\" In preparing his defense Edmondson subpoenaed some of the most prominent Jews of the time, including: Bernard Buruch, Henry Morgenthau, Rabbi Wise, Samuel Untermeyer, Mayor LaGuardia, James P. Warburg, Walter Lippmann and Justice Samuel Rosenman. In response, the American Jewish Committee petitioned the court to drop the charges against Edmondson. On May 10, 1938 the judge dismissed all indictments, ruling that there is no group libel law. In the early 1940s Edmondson was again indicted for his anti-Semitism along with 29 others on charges of sedition. The Great Sedition Trial of 1944, as it became known, was eventually declared a mistrial and the charges were later dismissed. He was widely believed by U.S. intelligence to have been an agent for Nazi Germany.Nian-Sheng Huang, Benjamin Franklin in American thought and culture, 1790-1990, 1994, p. 175 From New York City Edmondson moved to Stoddartsville, Pennsylvania and later to Grass Valley, California.Carlson, Under Cover, p. 275 Edmondson on the Jews The following quote expresses his ideology: > I am not against Jews because of their religion, as a race, a people or as > individuals, but because Jewish leadership [i.e., the bankers] is actively > anti-American, is attempting to jettison the American political philosophy > and take over the Country, and that I would continue to be anti-Jewish until > Jewry repudiated such subversion.

Farrow.Caroline Sigler, ed., Alternative Alices: Visions and Revisions of Lewis Carroll's Alice Books, Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1997; pp. 243-67. The book is an exercise in humorous nonsense, rich in wordplay and absurd situations, in the tradition of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. A popular success, it inaugurated a series of Wallypug sequels. The Wallypug of Why was Farrow's first book. It was well received by the reviewers who likened it to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and was enthusiastically received by its child readers, if we are to accept at face value the author's comments in the prefaces to his subsequent books.Gillian Avery, Introduction to The Wallypug of Why Victor Gollanz Ltd (1968) pg 7 The Wallypug of Why undeniably owes a great deal to Lewis Carroll. In the latter decades of the 19th century there were many Alice imitations, many of them very close to the original. Of these imitators Farrow is easily the best, and also the most prolific. The Wallypug is a genuinely original and endearing character, a \\"nervous little nonentity who in theory rules the land of Why, but in practice is ruled by his subjects whom he addresses as 'Your Majesty.'Avery, pg 9 Harry Furniss's drawings of the Wallypug with his crown tipped over one eye caught the character so well that other illustrators who worked on the Wallypug sequels copied the Furniss interpretation. The Wallypug of Why is rich in nonsense and absurd situations and it humorously depicts life in late-Victorian times. The novel's protagonist, known only as Girlie, finds a letter written home by her youngest brother (known only as Boy). The letter protrudes slightly from its envelope, and Girlie is able to read the following: :::::I have found a goo Rather than extract the letter from its envelope and read it completely, Girlie pauses to wonder what a \\"goo\\" might be -- which leads to a chain of fantastic events. She visits the land of Why, the source of all questions and answers, where the Wallypug is king. It is a topsy-turvy place: the Wallypug must address all the citizens as 'Your Majesty' and do what people tell him to do. Many of the residents are talking animals with curious habits and quirks of personality -- including a \\"socialistic cockatoo.\\" The book was illustrated by Harry Furniss, who had collaborated with Lewis Carroll on Sylvie and Bruno (1889) and Sylvie and Bruno Concluded (1893). It was provided with vignettes by Dorothy Furniss (1879‚Äì1944), Furniss's 15-year-old daughter.

(born September 7, 1949) is a supernumerary judge on the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal. He has practised law in both Quebec and the United Kingdom, focusing on maritime and transportation law. He was also an arbitrator and former lecturer in law at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke. Nadon was nominated by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to be a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada in October 2013. Following controversy about the appointment, the federal government referred the constitutionality of the appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada. In their decision in Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss 5 and 6, the Supreme Court quashed his appointment, concluding he did not meet the eligibility criteria provided in the Supreme Court Act. Early life and family Marc Nadon was born in St-J√©r√¥me, Qu√©bec, on September 7, 1949. His father played professional hockey with the American Hockey League in the 1940s\\"Ad Hoc Committee on the Appointment of Supreme Court of Canada Justices ,\\" Department of Justice, Canada, October, 2013 as well as being a businessman. His mother was of Ukrainian background whose parents immigrated to Canada from Ukraine during World War I. She was a professional singer, including singing at the Ch√¢teau Frontenac during the big band era. Nadon's father spoke French and English, but his mother spoke Ukrainian and English. His first language was English, but his education was entirely in French-speaking educational institutions. As a youth, it was his dream to become a professional hockey player and he played midget hockey in his hometown. He later appeared with the Junior A Laval Saints. However, his father forced him to choose whether he would continue to pursue a career in professional hockey or instead pursue a traditional career path. Nadon chose his studies, though later claimed that he had turned down a draft offer from the Detroit Red Wings. In 2013, it was reported that while Nadon was not actually drafted by the Detroit Red Wings, he did play with the Saint-J√©r√¥me Alouettes, a Junior A team whose midget affiliates were part of the Red Wings‚Äô farm team network. Nadon studied at Coll√®ge Lionel-Groulx and obtained his diploma of collegiate studies (D.E.C.) in 1970. In 1973, he earned his Licentiate in Laws (LL.L.) from the Universit√© de Sherbrooke. Nadon has been married for over 30 years to Margaret Buchan, a Scotswoman from the town of Peebles, Scotland. They have a son, Marc-Andr√©, who is also a lawyer and who practises at PFD Lawyers. As practitioner Nadon was admitted to the Bar of Quebec in 1974 and practiced law until 1993 at the firm of Martineau Walker (known today as Fasken), where he became a partner in 1981. From 1988 to 1990, he worked in the United Kingdom at the firm's London office. His practice essentially involved maritime law and transportation law. He taught maritime law and transportation law at the faculty of law at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke from 1987 to 1992. He primarily wrote about maritime law. In addition to this, he has worked in the fields of insurance and commercial law, particularly in matters regarding letters of credit and letters of exchange. As a result of his maritime law practice, he often appeared before the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. He also appeared before the Quebec Superior Court, and on occasion before the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. As a lawyer, Nadon also gained experience in the field of arbitration, specifically as arbitrator and member of the American Arbitration Association. He sat on several occasions as an arbitrator of maritime law disputes and was given terms as ad hoc arbitrator, in particular in litigation. He led arbitration in London and New York on behalf of clients in Canada and abroad. Throughout his years of practice, he was a member of the Canadian Bar Association and a member of the Canadian Maritime Law Association. As Federal Court judge Nadon was appointed as a judge to the Federal Court of Canada ‚Äì Trial Division, and ex officio a member of the Appeal Division of that Court on June 10, 1993. On April 14, 1994, he was appointed as a judge to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada. He was appointed as a member of the Competition Tribunal on December 16, 1998, for a term of seven years. On December 14, 2001, he was appointed as a judge to the Federal Court of Canada ‚Äì Appeal Division (now the Federal Court of Appeal), and ex officio a member of the Trial Division of that Court. He became a supernumerary judge on July 25, 2011. Nadon was a member of the Federal Courts Rules Committee for a number of years. He was also the Chair of the Education Committee of the Federal Court of Appeal and a member of the Court's Law Clerks Committee. Nadon's most outstanding ruling (in the opinion of a journalist) was written in 2010 when he found that the government of Stephen Harper had acted lawfully when it denied Omar Khadr repatriation from Guantanamo Bay prison, an offshore warehouse used by the US for detained terrorists. He was the only judge on three levels to side with the government. The Supreme Court of Canada later agreed with his view that it was no business of theirs to mandate Khadr's repatriation. Unsuccessful appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada Nadon was nominated by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper to be a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. He was formally appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada on October 3, 2013, and sworn in on October 7, 2013. Following controversy regarding his appointment, he stated that he would not hear cases until the legal challenge to his appointment was decided. His appointment was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss 5 and 6 on March 21, 2014. By a 6‚Äì1 margin, the Court found that he did not meet the requirement of section 6 of the Supreme Court Act, which requires that Quebec appointments to the Court be either a sitting judge on the Quebec Court of Appeal or Quebec Superior Court, or a current member of the Bar of Quebec. Consequently, the Court ruled his appointment had never taken effect and he remained a supernumerary judge of the Federal Court of Appeal. Works and speeches Learned texts * Seminars In January 2018, at a McGill University law school presentation hosted by the Runnymede Society, Nadon stated his view that the judiciary of Canada too often write their own interpretations of the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and thus present their own notions of fairness as substantive law, instead of being guided by the text of the Charter. In that sense, he thinks that they are politically inclined. Nadon sees himself in the tradition of an originalist and doctrinaire, in that judges must observe doctrine in order to protect the certainty of the law.

Named for the characteristic shape of its fruit bodies, this white Amanita has a slender stem, a cap covered with conical white warts, and an \\"abruptly enlarged\\" swollen base. This terrestrial species grows in mixed woods in eastern North America and eastern Asia, where it is thought to exist in a mycorrhizal relationship with a variety of both coniferous and deciduous tree species. Taxonomy Amanita abrupta was first described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1897, based on a specimen he found in Auburn, Alabama. Because the remains of the volva are not present on the bulb in dried, mature, specimens, Peck thought that the species should be grouped with Amanita rubescens and A. spissa. Synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers by Jean- Edouard Gilbert to Lepidella in 1928, and to Aspidella in 1940. Both of these genera have since been subsumed into Amanita. A. abrupta is the type species of the section Lepidella of the genus Amanita, in the subgenus Lepidella, a grouping of related Amanita mushrooms characterized by their amyloid spores. Other North American species in this subgenus include A. atkinsoniana, A. chlorinosma, A. cokeri, A. daucipes, A. mutabilis, A. onusta, A. pelioma, A. polypyramis, A. ravenelii, and A. rhopalopus. European and Asian species (also in section Lepidella) that are phylogenetically related‚Äîclose to it in the evolutionary family tree‚Äîinclude A. solitaria, A. virgineoides, and A. japonica. The specific epithet abrupta refers to the shape of the swollen base, which is abruptly enlarged rather than gradually tapering.Metzler and Metzler (1992), p. 64. The species' common name is the \\"American abrupt-bulbed Lepidella\\". Description ring on the stem is prominent in mature specimens. In Amanita abrupta, as with most mushrooms, the bulk of the organism lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose‚Äîcovered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1‚Äì2 mm tall by 1‚Äì2 mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it. The stem is tall, and slender, with a diameter of . It is white, smooth (glabrous), solid (that is, not hollow internally), and has an abruptly bulbous base with the shape of a flattened sphere; it may develop longitudinal splits on the sides. The base is often attached to a copious white mycelium‚Äîa visual reminder that the bulk of the organism lies unseen below the surface. The ring is membranous, and persistent‚Äînot weathering away with time; the ring may be attached to the stem with white fibers. The mushroom has no distinct odor. The mushroom is considered inedible; it is generally not recommended to consume Amanita mushrooms as some are very deadly. Microscopic characteristics The spores of A. abrupta are broadly elliptical or roughly spherical. When collected in deposit, such as with a spore print, the spores appear white. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are broadly elliptical or roughly spherical, smooth, thin-walled, and have dimensions of 6.5‚Äì9.5 by 5.5 by 8.5 ¬µm. Spores are amyloid (meaning they take up iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent) The basidia (spore-bearing cells on the edges of gills) are four- spored and measure 30‚Äì50 by 4‚Äì11 ¬µm. The bases of the basidia have clamp connections‚Äîshort branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of densely interwoven, sightly gelatinized, filamentous hyphae that are 3‚Äì8 ¬µm in diameter. The stem tissue is made of sparse, thin, longitudinally oriented hyphae measuring 294 by 39 ¬µm. Similar species The fruit bodies of Amanita kotohiraensis, a species known only from Japan, bears a superficial resemblance to A. abrupta, but A. kotohiraensis differs in having scattered floccose patches (tufts of soft woolly hairs that are the remains of the volva) on the cap surface, and pale yellow gills. A. polypyramis fruit bodies have also been noted to be similar to A. abrupta; however, it tends to have larger caps, up to in diameter, a fragile ring that soon withers away, and somewhat larger spores that typically measure 9‚Äì14 by 5‚Äì10 ¬µm. The amyloidity and size of the spores are reliable characteristics to help distinguish A. abrupta specimens with less prominently bulbous bases from other lookalike species. Mycologists Tsuguo Hongo and Rokuya Imazeki suggested in the 1980s that the Japanese mushroom A. sphaerobulbosa was synonymous with the North American A. abrupta. However, a 1999 study of Amanita specimens in Japanese herbaria concluded that they were closely related but distinct species, due to differences in spore shape and in the microstructure of the volval remnants. Another similar species, A. magniverrucata, is differentiated from A. abrupta by a number of characteristics: the universal veil is clearly separated from the flesh of the cap; the volval warts disappear more quickly because the surface of the cap cuticle gelatinizes; the partial veil is more persistent; the spores are smaller and roughly spherical; on the underside of the partial veil, the stem has surface fibrils that are drawn upward so as to somewhat resemble a cortina (a cobweb-like protective covering over the immature spore bearing surfaces); A. magniverrucata has a known distribution limited to the south western coast of North America. Habitat, distribution, and ecology The fruit bodies of A. abrupta grow on the ground, typically solitary, in mixed conifer and deciduous forests, usually during autumn.Jenkins (1986), p. 77. The frequency with which fruit bodies appear depends on several factors, such as season, location, temperature, and rainfall. The mushroom has been described as common in the Southeastern United States; in Texas, it has been called both infrequent, and common in the Big Thicket National Preserve. Like most other Amanita species, A. abrupta is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients.Jenkins (1986), p. 5. Amanita abrupta is widely distributed throughout eastern North America, where it has been found as far north as Quebec, Canada, and as far south as Mexico. Orson K. Miller claims to have found it in the Dominican Republic where it appeared to be growing in a mycorrizhal association with pine trees. Kuo also mentions a mycorrhizal relationship with both hardwoods and conifers, while Tulloss lists additional preferred tree hosts such as beech, birch, fir, tsuga, oak, and poplar. However, A. abrupta has been shown experimentally to not form mycorrhizae with Virginia Pine. Pharmacology Animal test based studies (mice) with aqueous extracts of Amanita abrupta have demonstrated hepatotoxic potential. Liver cell necrosis can be encountered.Fukuhara et al.: Hepatotoxic action of a poisonous mushroom, Amanita abrupta in mice and its toxic component, Toxicology, 1986. 2-Amino-4,5-hexadienoic acid is associated with these effects.Pubchem Open Chemistry Database: 2-Amino-4,5-hexadienoic acid (2017-07-01) See also *List of Amanita species References Cited books  abrupta Category:Fungi described in 1897 Category:Fungi of North America Category:Taxa named by Charles Horton Peck ","title":"Amanita abrupta"},{"id":"24027697","text":"John Maxwell Evans (born August 4, 1942) is a former judge of the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal.Federal Court of Appeal, Judges Biographies In 2013, Evans was listed as a NAFTA adjudicator.

The film is also known as Murder in the Air in the United Kingdom and as The Mysterious Bombardier (American reissue title). The film was Fanchon Royer's first production for her new company, Fanchon Royer Features, Inc. Film Daily reported that noted \\"G-Man\\" Melvin Purvis was offered a role in this film, but turned it down. The story concerns commercial aircraft being shot down by a large black fighter aircraft with a large \\"X\\" painted on the wing. The chief suspects may be the very pilots that have been gathered together to solve the mystery, and are invited for the weekend to an old dark mansion.Wynne 1987, p. 172. Plot Inspector Gallagher (Willard Kent) of the United States Department of Commerce views a number of crashes and disappearances of Goering-Gage Aviation Corporation aircraft as suspicious. With United States Army Reserve test pilot Jerry Blackwood (John Carroll), Gallagher visits the Goering-Gage company. Jerry test flies Goering- Gage aircraft but finds nothing wrong. When a severely injured passenger from a crash claims a mystery aircraft attacked them, the owner, Henry Goering (Henry Hall), hires psychiatrist Dr. Norris (John Elliott) to question the man. Dr. Norris believes a psychotic ex-World War I flying ace, whom he dubs \\"Pilot X,\\" may be behind the attacks. With the help of Blackwood, Goering and Norris assemble a group of five ex-flying aces living in the area who may have a connection with the mysterious Pilot X. He recruits German Lieutenant Baron von Guttard (Hans Joby), French Lieutenant Rene Le Rue (Gaston Glass), British Captain Roland Saunders (Pat Somerset), Canadian Lieutenant Douglas Thompson (Wheeler Oakman), and American Lieutenant John Ives (Reed Howes). The group meets in a mansion to plan how to confront the mysterious Pilot X. One pilot, however, von Guttard comes under immediate suspicion when Goering is uneasy with son Carl (Leon Ames), an ex-German prisoner of war. On their first patrol, Pilot X attacks, killing von Guttard. Later that day, Le Rue is killed by Pilot X and the next day, Saunders has a mental breakdown. Blackwood receives a note from Pilot X, asking him to meet him in the sky at six o'clock the next morning. Thompson, meanwhile, receives a similar note but Pilot X, who is on the airfield, paints an \\"X\\" on Thompson's aircraft. Blackwood mistakes Thompson for Pilot X, and kills the Canadian. When a paint can is found in Ives' locker, all accuse the American ace of being Pilot X. That night, Dr. Norris calls the elder Goering, telling him that he knows who is Pilot X, but is murdered. Gallagher believes Blackwood is Pilot X, and sends Ives and Saunders after him. Helen Gage (Lona Andre), Henry's ward, however, first finds part of Saunders' goggles near Norris' dead body, then finds the other half in his aircraft. Crazed, Saunders takes off after Blackwood with Helen trapped on his aircraft. Once in the sky, Pilot X appears and attacks Saunders, wounding him. In a fierce dogfight, Pilot X attacks Blackwood but is shot down. In the wreckage of Pilot X's aircraft the body of Carl Goering is discovered along with a photograph of Carl in a German uniform. He was not a prisoner of war, but deserted and joined the German Air Force. With the mystery solved, Blackwood and Helen realize that they are attracted to one another and embrace.

Life and career He was the illegitimate son of James Heath, a successful engraver who enjoyed the patronage of King George III and successive monarchs. Early in life he became a fellow of the Society of British Artists, and contributed for some years to their exhibitions. The American connection Jacob Perkins the American inventor developed siderography, a steel engraving technique, and in 1809 met Joseph Chessborough Dyer, an American who moved to England and acted as Perkins's agent. Perkins went to England in 1819, with his eldest son Ebenezer and associates, to bid for a Bank of England contract to print banknotes. He gained the contract. Heath had encouraged Perkins to come to England. From 1819 Charles Heath and then (1820) his half-brother George Heath (1779‚Äì1852) were in partnership with Perkins, working with the new technique of siderography. Charles Heath replaced Asa Spencer, a partner of Perkins who returned to the United States, while George Heath was a financial backer. Perkins and his other American partner Gideon Fairman were in the United Kingdom for a period. With finance from Dyer for a printing press, the company traded as Perkins, Fairman, and Heath.Kathryn Ledbetter, \\"The Copper and Steel Manufactory\\" of Charles Heath, Victorian Review Vol. 28, No. 2 (2002), pp. 21‚Äì30, at p. 24. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Initially Perkins and Heath used nitric acid for the steel engraving, and shallow lines were an issue during the 1820s. They then jointly purchased rights to the etching fluid developed by Wilson Lowry. Joshua Butters Bacon (1790‚Äì1863), son-in-law of Perkins who settled in England, bought out the Heath interest in the company, by mid-1829. It then assumed the name Perkins, Bacon or Perkins Bacon by which it is usually known. Rights of engravers Charles Heath believed that custom entitled engravers to make and keep a limited number of impressions of their work. When he was sued by the publisher, John Murray, in 1826, as a result of having made and kept such impressions, he relied on that supposed custom, but, in 1830, a jury denied its existence. Then, in 1831, the judges of the Court of King's Bench held that his conduct had been unlawful at common law, though not a breach of the Prints Copyright Act 1777. Annuals An entrepreneur who sought out other new markets, Heath was a driving force behind, and contributor to, the new genre of the literary annual. He established his own annual, The Keepsake, first published at the end of 1827, and approached William Harrison Ainsworth to become its editor. His first choice had been Sir Walter Scott, then having money troubles. Scott had declined, but sent Heath some stories first intended for Chronicles of the Canongate. Later life Heath was successful in business, with some serious difficulties, but in the 1840s encountered cash flow problems, and sold stock from his back catalogue to stay afloat. He persisted in trying to interest the Bank of England in engraving work, though paper money was less needed after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Henry Corbould as designer. Charles Heath (engraver), and George Heath (financial backer) contracted for paper money and postage stamps with several governments. The Penny Black was designed by William Wyon, Corbould and Heath. Among Heath's pupils were George Thomas Doo (1800‚Äì1886), William Henry Mote (1803-1871), and James Henry Watt (1799‚Äì1867). Works Heath received training in engraving from his father James, and his first known etching dates from when he was six years old. It was from his father that he learnt how to produce small plates suitable for book illustration. He was a noted if self-regarding illustrator of the Waverley Novels, and engraved Christ healing the Sick in the Temple, one of Benjamin West's big scriptural paintings. After Richard Westall, he engraved illustrations to Lord Byron's poems, published in 1819.Fiona Wilson, \\"Virt'ous Fraud\\": The Perverse Politics of the \\"Caritas Romana\\" Scene in \\"Childe Harold\\", Keats-Shelley Journal Vol. 54 (2005), pp. 93‚Äì112, at pp. 109‚Äì110. Published by: Keats-Shelley Association of America, Inc. As an engraver, Heath exhibited at the Royal Academy and Suffolk Street Gallery from 1801 to 1825. After 1828 he produced little work of his own, but his studio was productive through his pupils Doo and Watt, and his sons. Thomas Garner was taken on by the studio in the 1820s, to work uncredited on annuals. As did his competitor Edward Finden, Heath outsourced work to a substantial group of engravers into the 1830s and 1840s, and employed a production line technique with division of labour.Kathryn Ledbetter, \\"The Copper and Steel Manufactory\\" of Charles Heath, Victorian Review Vol. 28, No. 2 (2002), pp. 21‚Äì30, at p. 26. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Heath initially commissioned, and the studio produced, the engraved series Picturesque Views in England and Wales by J. M. W. Turner, eventually running to 100 watercolours by Turner for a part publishing project from 1827 to 1838. This collection has been considered a central part of Turner's opus, by Andrew Wilton, but in business terms was not a great success in its time. Family Heath married his cousin Elizabeth Petch. Two of their sons, Frederick (1810‚Äì1878) and Alfred (1812‚Äì1896), were engravers and another, Henry Charles Heath (1829‚Äì1898), was a miniature painter who portrayed Queen Victoria and other members of the royal family.Charles Heath biography.

The company raised $58 million in venture capital and was acquired by Appen and Five River Group of Industries in March 2019 for $300 million. It uses human intelligence to do simple tasks such as transcribing text or annotating images to train machine learning algorithms. Figure Eight's software automates tasks for machine learning algorithms, which can be used to improve catalog search results, approve photos or support customers and the technology can be used in the development of self-driving cars, intelligent personal assistants and other technology that uses machine learning. The company is a Machine Learning Competency Partner in Amazon's AWS Machine Learning Partner Solutions program. Figure Eight works with companies such as Autodesk, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Cisco Systems, GitHub, Mozilla, VMware, eBay, Etsy, Toyota and American Express. History Establishment Originally called Dolores Labs, the company was founded in 2007 by Lukas Biewald and Chris Van Pelt. They found a need for temporary workers doing simple tasks that could not be automated. After experimenting with pictures and questions related to them on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing internet marketplace, they encouraged others to participate in their experimentation through the site Facestat. They collected 20 million assessments of people's faces within three months and began to add queries for companies needing data such as event listing site Zvents and O'Reilly Media. Dolores Labs, initially in a loft space in the Mission District briefly moved to an office on Valencia Street which it outgrew in nine months. They felt the name Dolores Labs was too research-oriented and sounded like experimentation, so the company was renamed CrowdFlower. In 2009, CrowdFlower held an official launch at the TechCrunch50 conference. A sleek logo replaced its previous mint-eating alligator. The company moved to its third office in the Mission in early 2010. The name Dolores Labs was adopted by Dan Scholnick of Trinity Ventures who turned the name and previous office space into a co-working and startup incubator space. Disaster relief In 2009, the company provided work for refugees in Kenya who completed microtasks; iPhone users donated their time by checking for accuracy through the app Give Work. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, CrowdFlower again worked with Samasource to help Haitians find work through the application GiveWork. Funding and expansion In 2009, the company had raised a total of $1.2 million in seed funding from investors Dave McClure, co-founder of Cloudera Jeff Hammerbacher, and FF Angel. In 2010, it raised a $5 million Series A round of funding from investors including Trinity Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners. Founders Lukas Biewald and Chris Van Pelt were included on Inc.'s 30 Under 30 list in 2010. In 2011, CrowdFlower raised a Series B funding round that totaled $9.3 million and included investor Harmony Venture Partners. The company's Series C funding, which closed in September 2014, totaled $12.5 million. In 2014, CrowdFlower was named Best in Show at FinovateFall. The company established a scientific advisory board in 2016, which made up of entrepreneur Barney Pell, founder and CEO of Kaggle Anthony Goldbloom, and staff research engineer at Google, Pete Warden. That same year, it raised a $10 million Series D funding round led by Microsoft Ventures, Canvas Ventures and Trinity Ventures. The following year, CrowdFlower raised $20 million in a venture capital round led by Industry Ventures and included Salesforce Ventures, Canvas Ventures, Microsoft Ventures, and Trinity Ventures. The company announced its international expansion with an office in Israel in October 2016. CrowdFlower was named to the 2017 list of Cool Vendors released by Gartner. That same year, it received AWS Machine Learning Competency status from Amazon Web Services. In 2018, CrowdFlower was included on the Forbes list of 100 Companies Leading the Way in A.I. On March 3rd, 2018, CrowdFlower announced that the company was going to be rebranded as Figure Eight. The company also shifted its focus to machine learning as well as artificial intelligence. Technology In June 2012, the company released version 2.0 of its Real Time Foto Moderator which checks photographs for adult or inappropriate content. The new version included two different \\"rule sets\\" to determine appropriate photos including a stricter rule set and one that is more flexible. The update also added an option for moderators to specify why a photo is rejected. That same year, Parse partnered with CrowdFlower to add photo moderation to its backend services designed for mobile app development. In November 2014, CrowdFlower announced that it was releasing support for eight new languages crowds to its platform, making twelve available language crowds at the time. In 2015, CrowdFlower AI launched at the Rich Data Summit. The AI platform combines machine learning and human-labeled training data to create data sets used for predictive models. Microsoft partnered with CrowdFlower in October 2016 to create a \\"human-in-the-loop\\" platform using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. In May 2017, CrowdFlower released an enhancement for its Computer Vision software, announced during the Train AI conference, designed to simplify and speed up the process of annotating images. Applications In 2015, CrowdFlower announced the Data For Everyone initiative, which included a collection of data sets available to researchers and entrepreneurs.

The film is also known under its American promotional title Uncle Andy Hardy. This was the 15th, next-to-last Andy Hardy film produced. The final installment, Andy Hardy Comes Home, would be made 12 years later (1958) in a failed attempt to revive the franchise. This film was also noteworthy for being the last to feature veteran character actor Lewis Stone as Judge Hardy. Stone continued his career for the next seven years, making 10 more films until his death in 1953 at age 73.  Plot  The story starts in the small town of Carvel, where the honorable judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) and his wife Emily (Fay Holden) eagerly await their son's return from the military. Andy (Mickey Rooney) has received an honorable discharge from the Army after a service of two years. His parents are unaware of the fact that Andy is looking to get back with his college sweetheart Kay (Bonita Granville). One day soon after Andy's homecoming, his mother Emily observes him looking at store window displays of wedding rings and baby clothing, and suspects that her son must be in love. Emily's suspicions are soon confirmed when Andy, who usually has had an eye for girls, barely notices the very attractive singer, Isobel Gonzales (Lina Romay), when they are introduced. Isabel is a regular singer at the Carvel country club, and when Andy comes there and they are introduced to each other, she falls in love with him. Andy, however, isn't smitten by Isabel in the same way, still preoccupied with thinking about his college sweetheart. Andy wants to return to Wainwright college to finish his studies and meet his sweetheart as soon as possible. Andy is very determined though, to keep the romance a secret form his parents. When Andy is with his parents visiting the country club, he finds out there is a telegram, sent by Kay, that is supposed to be delivered to him at his parents house. He panics, and in a desperate attempt to hide it from his parents, he makes up an excuse to leave the club to help out a friend. He convinces a friend to cover for him and spread a fake story about a broken water faucet. But in reality he rushes home to the house and intercepts the telegram before anyone else gets to see it. A series of unfortunate events take place from this moment on. Andy is about to take a shower at the house when he realises that the water is switched off. He goes outside in his robe to switch it on, when the front door shuts behind him and locks automatically. Andy is stranded outside in the garden, and has to wait in the shrubbery until his parents arrive home from the country club. Before he has a chance to get inside the house again, a passing police man discovers him hiding in the bushes. The police man doesn't believe Andy's story when he tries to explain his business in the garden, and insists on taking him inside to get a confirmation from his parents. Emily is upset with her son's recent erratic behaviour and blames the fact that he is blinded by love. She forces her husband to talk with his son and straighten him out on the subject of choosing the right kind of woman. Andy confesses his plan to ask Kay to marry him when he comes back to college. His parents don't approve of this plan and decide to follow him to Wainwright ‚Äì to keep an eye on him and keep him away from his sweetheart. The president of the school council, Duke Johnson (Hal Hackett), offers Andy the honor of being chairman of the freshman dance as soon as he gets back to the college. Andy accepts the offer, but finds out soon after that Kay cannot attend the dance. Because of a family emergency she is required to go home to her legal guardian, Dane Kittridge (Dick Simmons). Duke understands that Andy is in need of a date at the dance, so he sets up with a girl named Coffy Smith (Dorothy Ford), who is a great deal taller than Andy, making him look ridiculous beside her. Andy is quite embarrassed by their appearance together, but soon warms up to the bigger girl and they become good friends. Andy is shocked however, when Kay comes back to Wainwright and tells him that she has fallen in love with her guardian Dane, and that she is planning on marrying him the very next day. Andy is heartbroken, but as a sign of good faith he nevertheless agrees to be Kay's best man at the wedding. When the wedding is over Andy makes plans to go to South America and forget his sorrows, but his father talks to him and convinces him to go back to Wainwright and complete his degree.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/288/Love-Laughs-at-Andy-Hardy/  Cast  * Mickey Rooney as Andy Hardy * Lewis Stone as Judge Hardy * Sara Haden as Aunt Milly * Bonita Granville as Kay Wilson * Lina Romay as Isobel Gonzales * Fay Holden as Mrs. Emily Hardy * Dorothy Ford as Coffy Smith * Hal Hackett as Duke Johnson * Dick Simmons as Dane Kittridge * Clinton Sundberg as Haberdashery clerk * Geraldine Wall as Miss Geeves * Addison Richards as Mr. Benedict Production While Mickey Rooney was in the army, MGM announced Booth Tarkington had developed a story for a Hardy movie without Andy, The Hardy Family's Country Cousin.

It began as a sub-committee of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science. It was disbanded in 1865.  History  In 1847, Louisa Twining started to visit an old family nurse and from her she heard about the conditions inside of workhouses. In 1853, she made her first visit to a workhouse and found it to be overcrowded, and lacking food, sanitation and medical care. Afterwards, she approached the Strand Union Poor Law Board for permission to allow a group of ladies to visit one of its workhouses and they initially refused to give it. However, she argued that it was proper for women to look after the old, young and infirm. The Stand Union Poor Law Board and its guardians changed their decision and allowed the visit. In 1857, she started to publicise the poor conditions within workhouses. Additionally, she encouraged the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science to establish a visiting system to provide moral and spiritual comfort to the inmates, and to make the public aware of the poor conditions inside workhouses. In 1858 the Workhouse Visiting Society was established and Twining became its first secretary. By 1860 it had 140 active members, who visited the 12 metropolitan workhouses, and there were several local branches in other parts of England. In 1863, the organisation was based at 23 New Ormond Street, Bloomsbury, London. Its members role when visiting workhouses was to show compassion to the inmates. The society focused on publicising the poor conditions inside workhouses that included the production of its own journal. The society was active in exposing the poor standards of nursing care. It also influenced politicians such Lord Shaftesbury to consider workhouse issues. A problem was the number of Workhouse Visiting Society members was too small to cover and deal with all of the problems related to workhouses. In 1865, it was disbanded. Between 1859 and 1865, the society produced the Journal of the Workhouse Visiting Society, published by Longman, Brown, Green, Longman and Roberts, London. It included correspondence and reports about workhouse issues.

Working principle Jet aerators are applied across a wide range of water, wastewater and biosolids treatment applications. Their primary purpose is to transfer oxygen to the liquid or sludge. A Jet aerator works through aspirating technology by simultaneously introducing large volumes of high kinetic energy liquid and air through one or more jet nozzles. The high velocity liquid exits the inner, primary jet and rapidly mixes with the incoming air in the outer jet. This intense mixing and high degree of turbulence in the gas/liquid cloud travels outward from the jet along the basin floor prior to the vertical rise of the gas bubble column to the liquid surface. Applications, features and benefits Oxygen transfer efficiency and energy savings In most industrial wastewater and biosolids applications jet aerators exhibit superior oxygen transfer efficiency compared to other aeration technologies. The hydrodynamic conditions within the jet and fine bubble cloud produces continuous surface renewal at the gas/liquid interface resulting in higher alpha factors. This results in superior process oxygen transfer performance in the presence of surfactants, extracellular enzymes and high MLS concentrations. Process flexibility Jet aerators do not require any external air source (i.e. compressor), except for the surrounding atmosphere. Jet aerators can be installed either as submersible units or piped through the tank wall using an external dry-installed chopper pump to feed the aspirating ejector(s). Jet aerators are easily configured into any basin geometry including circular, rectangular, looped reactors and sloped wall basins. Jet aerators are ideally suited for deep tank processes. The jet oxidation ditch is an example of technology innovation where the combination of a deeper basin design, bottom to top mixing and conservation of momentum combines to make a very efficient treatment process. In this and other applications the independent control of oxygen transfer and mixing is a valuable feature for both process control and energy savings. Applications * Equalization basins at sewage treatment plants * Sewage wet wells and lift stations * Aerobic digesters * Leachate processing from landfills * Waste processing at slaughterhouses, poultry abattoirs, fish processing plants, etc. * Waste processing at tanneries (Article at Leather International) * Pulp and paper - aeration of waste sludge * As compresor-less aerator in electrochemical reactors to produce hydrogen peroxide J.F.

He was a WaliUllah (Sufi saint) of the Chishti Sufi order; his Sufi convent (zawyah) is located in the village of Sial Sharif. He was also the founder of the Barelvi political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (representing the Ulama of the Ahl-e-Sunnah Wa-al-Jamaa'ah denomination in Pakistan) and became its president in 1970. He is also credited for being one of the foremost and staunchest supporters of the movement for the creation of Pakistan. Early life and education Khwaja Qamaruddin Sialvi was born on 24 Jumada al-awwal 1324 A.H. (7 July 1906), in Sial Sharif in the Punjab Province of British India. He was the eldest son of Zia-ud-din Sialvi. He was familiar with the Quran by the age of nine. He received his religious education at several institutions, including ones in Mecca and Ajmer. Khwaja Qamar Ul Din Sialvi and Family in 1947 When his age was four years, four months and ten days, Khawaja Diya' al-Din enrolled him to memorise the Qur'an in the class of Hafiz Karim Bakhsh. He very quickly memorised the Qur'an in a short span of time. Following that, capable teachers taught him Persian and Arabic etymology and syntax with much joy and hardwork and this capable student accepted all that he was taught with much joy and enthusiasm. When he was very young and was reading the Kanz al-Daqa'iq, during this time he wrote a commentary on a difficult issue within the Kanz al-Daqa'iq in the Arabic language. After seeing it, great learned scholars were left amazed. This written piece caused a greater sense of enhancing the education and upbringing of this student in the heart of his father; Khawaja Diya' al-Din. As a result, he looked towards a distinguished scholar from the Khayr Abadi family of knowledge and wisdom, Maulana Mu'in al-Din Ajmayri. At that time, he was the principal teacher at Madrasa 'Uthmaniyya Dar al-Khayr in Ajmayr (India) and so for some time, Khawaja Diya' al-Din sent his beloved son to Ajmayr in pursuit of education. Later on, Maulana Ajmayri was brought from Ajmayr to Siyal and Khawaja Qamar al-Din continued acquiring knowledge from him. A student of Maulana Ajmayri, Maulana Muhammad Husayn, also began teaching in Siyal at Dar al-'Ulum Diya' Shams al-Islam. Khawaja Qamar al-Din studied philosophy and logic with one of the leading masters of the Khayarabadi tradition, Maulana Muhammad Din Budhwi, who was considered unparalleled in his age in the rational sciences as well as in many other subjects. Khawaja Qamar al-Din completed these various sciences and disciplines from these learned scholars. He also completed the Dawra Hadith with Maulana Ajmayri, who consequently bestowed the sanad and ijaza of hadith narration to him.The Gnostic of Siyal; Shaykh al-Islam wa'l-Muslimeen, Khawaja Muhammad Qamar al-Din, by Mahboob Hussain Al Azhari Khwaja Qamar Ul Din Sialvi and Murids Muslim League When Pakistan movement began for the independence of India, the Congress was at the forefront whose leadership was in the hands of some prejudiced and narrow-minded Hindus. However, the deceit of the main Hindu leaders had allured many Muslims to their tune and to raise their same voice. Many Muslim scholars, leaders and the learned had become devotees of Indian nationality and stood side by side with the Hindu leaders. At that moment Qa'id A'zam Muhammad 'Ali Jinnah demanded the formation of Pakistan. Khawaja Qamar al-Din ‚Äì through his light of firasat ‚Äì perceived the truth of Qa'id A'zam's position whilst great intellectuals of that time could not decide whether the claim of Qa'id A'zam had any acceptance or weight in it or not, or whether it is practicable or not. Khawaja Qamar al-Din, with firm resolve and certainty, announced his assistance and loyalty to Qa'id A'zam in the struggle to acquire Pakistan. History testifies that this man of truth, whatever step he took he did not stop until he reached his desired destination and objective.The Gnostic of Siyal; Shaykh al-Islam wa'l-Muslimeen, Khawaja Muhammad Qamar al-Din, by Mahboob Hussain Al Azhari The pursuing of a referendum in the Sarhad province was much dangerous as the Khan Brothers had great influence and power here and they were blind devotees of Gandhi. The Red Shirts movement was accepted here to such an extent that in every town and village of the Sarhad province, red flags were waving. If in this referendum the Muslim League was defeated then the dream of Pakistan would have become dispersed and diminished before any interpretation could be given. The bravery of the people who paved the way for the success of the Muslim community in Sarhad, without a doubt at the front of this group, you would clearly see the shining face of Khawaja Qamar al-Din. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Sialvi donated all the ornaments of his family to the Pakistan Army. In 1970 he became the president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan (JUP) and under his leadership party won seven seats in the National Assembly. Under his leadership, the party fared very well in the election of 1970. He was twice nominated as a member of the Islamic Ideology Council, where he worked hard to Islamicize the existing laws.

This species is also displayed in public aquariums. Description The body of the Silver surfperch is oval and strongly compressed. The head is small and the mouth is moderately large. The body is silvery with dusky (brownish to gray) coloration on the back and dusky bars on the sides. The tail is usually pink with an occasional orange spot on the anal fin. The specific name ellipticum refers to its elliptical body outline. It looks similar to the Walleye surfperch (H. argenteum) but lacks the black coloration on its pelvic fins. This species can reach a length of TL. Range Silver surfperch occur from Rio San Vicente, Baja California, to Schooner Cove, near Tofino, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. These small surfperch primarily frequent the sandy surf zone although they are also caught among shallow rocks from piers, and in bays. Natural history The diet of Silver surfperch includes shrimp, crustaceans, amphipods and algae. As with all surfperch, the young are born alive and are relatively large. Mating occurs during the fall and early winter months. The male approaches the female from below; both swim with vents close for 2 or 3 seconds, then separate and repeat the process. Three to 16 young are born the following spring and summer. Fishing information Silver surfperch rank among the top ten in numbers caught by recreational anglers in central and northern California, even though the average weight is 0.1 pound. They are plentiful, easy to catch and occur in large numbers in surf, shore and pier catches.

Since the mid-1970's she has worked in photography, painting, sculpture, video and performance. Julie's work expresses her interest in images of the body, especially the female body. She has participated in many exhibitions in Australia and abroad, won many awards, and is represented in major public and private collection in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, France, and the U.S.A.  Biography  Julie was born in Lismore, New South Wales, Australia. Her family relocated to a small town, Nerang, in the Hinterlands off the Gold Coast, Queensland, which is where she grew up with her sister and brothers who included Mike Parr--an artist with whom she has often collaborated. In 1971 she completed her Bachelor of Arts Degree at the University of Queensland, Brisbane Australia. In 1974 she continued studies in painting and drawing at the National Art School, East Sydney Technical College (later the City Art Institute), at the University of Sydney. In 1975 she studied at the Power Worksheds in the Fine Arts Department of the University of Sydney. In 1976 she studied photo media at the City Art Institute in Sydney. In Julie Rrap's early career she was running a photographic business with John Delacour who is also a photographer. The business mainly specialised in reproductions of magazines, catalogues, and fine art books. In 1975 Rrap worked with members of a performance art group (Alex Danko, Mike Parr, Noel Sheridan, Joan Grounds and Tim Burns) from the University of Sydney. In 1976, Rrap married Bill Brown, a painter. In the 1980s Rrap focused a lot of her time at universities and art schools such as the Australian Centre for Photography, Alexander Mackie College, Meadowbank, East Sydney Technical College, and Sydney College of the Arts, providing lectures in art and design, painting, photography, and photo-media. Julie Rrap then lived in France and Belgium between 1986 and 1994. This helped to ground her work in a more international context, and she exhibited widely during this period. In 1994. Julie returned to Australia.. In 2010 Rrap completed her PhD at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Rrap lives and works in Sydney, and frequently travels between Europe and Australia for exhibitions and the creation of her works. She continues to work in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Sydney and leads research and publishes about artists. Artist career In 2018, The University of Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Art published interviews with three Creative Women of Sydney. In her interview, Julie noted that \\"As a very young artist I was very influenced by the writings of Simone de Beauvoir but as art history did not foreground the work of many women artists it was hard to think at the time of women artists who might influence my work.\\" She continued \\"this ‚Äòlack therefore influenced my decision to make art as I felt there was so much missing from that history that could represent female sensibilities.\\" Rrap's artistic career began in the 1970s where she explored painting, performance, photography, sculpture and video. Rrap‚Äôs artistic influences throughout her career have always been the human form and how it is represented in media and society, particularly females in Western Society. Julie uses this influence to \\"‚Ä¶poke fun at the stereotypical representations of women transforming these characters into active agents for change.\\" ‚Äì Julie Rrap. Using her body, suggestions of the body and representations of the body to complete her work. Julie exhibited her first solo exhibition as Julie Brown in 1982, Disclosures: A Photographic Construct held at the Central Street Gallery in Sydney. This installation was made up of 60 black-and-white and 19 coloured photographs of her own naked body posed to challenge the traditional \\"male gaze\\" of the female nude. Some photos showed her in various costumes and various suggestive poses, some cut up and collaged with parts of the body absent. The coloured photos all showed her full nude body. This work influenced future feminist art. Rrap has continued to use her own body in her works right up to her 2009 video work 360 Degree Self-Portrait. In her early works, Julie superimposed photos of herself on images by Manet, Degas and Rembrandt. In this way she imposed her own image as an artist to disrupt the given models. In 1994, her work Transpositions covered a wall with 100 boards on which were printed photographs of historical portraits of women. Each woman's eyes captures the viewer's gaze. They are no longer the model of the original artist, but women on their own. This is Julie's way of stressing the women's lives over art history and the traditional male gaze. This work was a turning point; she stopped using her own body image. Now she may use skin, leather or other materials but she still explores the relationship between the female image and how it is portrayed in whatever media.

In her 30s she started work on projects related to the Poor Law which she followed for the rest of her life. She helped to establish a home for workhouse girls and a number of societies and associations related to workhouses and infirmaries. She also served as a Poor Law guardian and was president of the Women's Local Government Society.[1] Biography Louisa Twining was born at 20 Norfolk Street (now gone) in central London, not far from her family's famous Twinings tea business on the Strand. She was the ninth and youngest child of Richard Twining (1772‚Äì1857), and his wife Elizabeth Mary, n√©e Smythies (1779‚Äì1866). Twining's maternal ancestry is well documented in The Longcrofts: 500 Years of a British Family by James Phillips-Evans (Amazon UK, 2012). In the early part of her adult life, Louisa was an artist and art historian and she wrote and published Symbols and Emblems of Mediaeval Christian Art (1852) and Types and Figures of the Bible (1854). Louisa was the youngest sister of the botanical artist Elizabeth Twining. Louisa was inspired in her youth by the conditions in which her nurse lived in her advanced age: the old woman lived in one of the poorest districts in London. With exposure to such poverty, Twining felt inclined to improve social conditions. In 1853, she became interested in movements for social reform, and began the work in connection with the Poor Law to which she devoted the rest of her life. In March 1861, she helped to establish a home for workhouse girls sent out to service, in 1864 the Workhouse Visiting Society, in 1866 the Association for the Improvement of the Infirmaries of London Workhouses and in 1879 the Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association. She was said to be ‚Äòthe most practical woman I have ever known amongst the many who have taken an interest in the subject‚Äô by Uvedale Corbett. She was a Poor Law guardian for Kensington during 1884‚Äì90, and for Tonbridge Union during 1893‚Äì6. She promoted the opening of Lincoln's Inn Fields to the public, helped to start the Metropolitan and National Association for nursing the poor in their homes, did much to secure the appointment of police matrons, and was president of the Women's Local Government Society.

Jaipur is the present-day capital of the state of Rajasthan, and until 1949 the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. The Palace was also the location of religious and cultural events, as well as a patron of arts, commerce, and industry. It now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, and continues to be the home of the Jaipur royal family. The royal family of Jaipur is said to be the descendants of Lord Rama. The palace complex has several buildings, various courtyards, galleries, restaurants, and offices of the Museum Trust. The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum Trust looks after the Museum, and the royal cenotaphs (known as chhatris).  Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum Trust  The MSMS II Museum Trust is headed by chairperson Rajamata Padmini Devi of Jaipur (from Sirmour in Himachal Pradesh). Princess Diya Kumari runs the Museum Trust, as its secretary and trustee. She also manages The Palace School and Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singh School in Jaipur. She founded and runs the Princess Diya Kumari Foundation to empower underprivileged and underemployed women of Rajasthan. She is also an entrepreneur. In 2013, she was elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly of Rajasthan from the constituency of Sawai Madhopur. The Trust was founded by Brig Sawai Bhawani Singh, the last titular Maharaja.  History  The palace complex lies in the heart of Jaipur city, to the northeast of the very centre, located at . The site for the palace was located on the site of a royal hunting lodge on a plain land encircled by a rocky hill range, five miles south of Amber (city). The history of the city palace is closely linked with the history of Jaipur city and its rulers, starting with Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II who ruled from 1699 to 1744. He is credited with initiating construction of the city complex by building the outer wall of the complex spreading over many acres. Initially, he ruled from his capital at Amber, which lies at a distance of from Jaipur. He shifted his capital from Amber to Jaipur in 1727 because of an increase in population and increasing water shortage. He planned Jaipur city in six blocks separated by broad avenues, on the classical basis of principals of Vastushastra and another similar classical treatise under the architectural guidance of Vidyadar Bhattacharya, a Bengali architect from Naihati of present-day West Bengal who was initially an accounts-clerk in the Amber treasury and later promoted to the office of Chief Architect by the King.Brown p.149 Following Jai Singh's death in 1857, there were internecine wars among the Rajput kings of the region but cordial relations were maintained with the British Raj. Maharaja Ram Singh sided with the British in the Sepoy Mutiny or Uprising of 1857 and established himself with the Imperial rulers. It is to his credit that the city of Jaipur including all of its monuments (including the City Palace) are stucco painted 'Pink' and since then the city has been called the \\"Pink City\\".The change in the colour scheme was as an honor of hospitality extended to the Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VII) on his visit. This color scheme has since then become a trademark of the Jaipur city. Man Singh II, the adopted son of Maharaja Madho Singh II, was the last Maharaja of Jaipur to rule from the Chandra Mahal palace, in Jaipur. This palace, however, continued to be a residence of the royal family even after the Jaipur kingdom merged with the Indian Union in 1949 (after Indian independence in August 1947) along with other Rajput states of Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Bikaner. Jaipur became the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan and Man Singh II had the distinction of becoming the Rajapramukh (present-day Governor of the state) for a time and later was the Ambassador of India to Spain. While the Jaipur maharanis observed pardah, they enjoyed considerable power and agency. Queens ‚Äì often the senior-most (Pat-Rani) had a say in the governance of the kingdom or estate in the absence of the ruler. Two queens wielding full authority were Raja Man Singh of Dhoondhar's Bhati clan wife, and Maharaja Rai Singh of Bikaner's wife, Rani Ganga Bai. Wives and mothers of Rajput kings and chiefs also took upon themselves the role of counseling the men over issues they felt transgressed warrior codes of behavior and action. Women from ruling groups or warrior castes held property in their own names, with full rights over those lands. Many warrior clan women got lands for their maintenance as personal jagirs and haath-kharch ki jagir (personal spending from the province) from both, their natal families, and the families they married into, and administered such lands through personal administrative agents (kamdars, amils, and dewans). From within zenanas, these women remained fully informed about their individual jagirs. Details about crops, law, and order, social problems, appeals from the peasantry, came to them through their stewards or agents, who took instructions directly from the women and were answerable only to them. The women used the revenues from their estates solely as they wished.places to visit in jaipur Architecture The City Palace is in the central-northeast part of the Jaipur city, which is laid in a unique pattern with wide avenues. It is a unique and special complex of several courtyards, buildings, pavilions, gardens, and temples. The most prominent and most visited structures in the complex are the Chandra Mahal, Mubarak Mahal, Shri Govind Dev Temple, and the City Palace Museum.  Govind Dev Ji temple  Govind Dev Ji temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Krishna, is part of the City Palace complex. Govind Dev an important deity, featured in many paintings, and on a large pichchawi (painted backdrop) on display in the Painting and Photography gallery.  Entrance gates  Rajendra Pol The Udai Pol near Jaleb chowk, the Virendra Pol near Jantar Mantar, and the Tripolia (three pols or gates) are the three main entry gates of the City Palace. The Tripolia gate is reserved for the entry of the royal family into the palace. Common people and visitors can enter the place complex only through the Udai Pol and the Virendra Pol. The Udai Pol leads to the Sabha Niwas (the Diwan-e- Aam or hall of public audience) through a series of tight dog-leg turns. The Virendra Pol leads to the Mubarak Mahal courtyard, which in turn is connected to the Sarvato Bhadra (the Diwan-e-Khas) through the Rajendra Pol. The gateways were built at different times across the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries and are richly decorated in the contemporary architectural styles prevalent at the time.Brown p.163  Sabha Niwas (Diwan-e-Aam)  Sabha Niwas Modeled on the lines of a Mughal hall of audience, the Diwan-e-Aam, the Sabha Niwas, is a hall of the public audience. It has multiple cusped arches supported by marble columns and a beautifully painted plaster ceiling. The jalis on the southern end of the hall would have been used by women to oversee the proceedings in the hall, and facilitated their involvement in the outside world, while following the purdah.  Sarvato Bhadra (Diwan-e-Khas)  Sarvato Bhadra The Sarvato Bhadra is a unique architectural feature. The unusual name refers to the building's form: a Sarvato Bhadra is a single- storeyed, square, open hall, with enclosed rooms at the four corners. One use of the Sarvato Bhadra was as the Diwan-e-Khas, or the Hall of Private Audience, which meant the ruler could hold court with the officials and nobles of the kingdom in a more private, intimate space than the grand spaces of the Sabha Niwas in the next courtyard, which was open to more people. But it's also one of the most important ritual buildings in the complex, and continues to be so today, representing as it does, ‚Äòliving heritage‚Äô. Because of its location between the public areas and the private residence, it has traditionally been used for important private functions like the coronation rituals of the Maharajas of Jaipur. Today, it continues to be used for royal festivals and celebrations like Dusshera. During Gangaur and Teej, the image of the goddess is placed in her palanquin in the centre of the hall, before being carried in procession around the city. During the harvest festival of Makar Sankranti, paper kites belonging to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II who lived almost 150 years ago are displayed in the centre, and the roof is used for flying kites. It is also used for more modern celebrations like parties and weddings. There are two huge sterling silver vessels of height and each with capacity of 4000 litres and weighing , on display here. They were made from 14,000 melted silver coins without soldering. They hold the Guinness World Record as the world's largest sterling silver vessels. These vessels were specially commissioned by Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II to carry the water of the Ganges to drink on his trip to England in 1901 (for Edward VII's coronation). Hence, the vessels are named as Gangajalis (Ganges-water urns).Brown p.156  Pritam Niwas Chowk  It is the inner courtyard, which provides access to the Chandra Mahal. Here, there are four small gates (known as Ridhi Sidhi Pol) that are adorned with themes representing the four seasons and Hindu gods. The gates are the Northeast Peacock Gate (with motifs of peacocks on the doorway) representing autumn and dedicated Lord Vishnu; the Southeast Lotus Gate (with continual flower and petal pattern) suggestive of summer season and dedicated to Lord Shiva-Parvati; the Northwest Green Gate, also called the Leheriya (meaning: \\"waves\\") gate, in green colour suggestive of spring and dedicated to Lord Ganesha, and lastly, the Southwest Rose Gate with repeated flower pattern representing winter season and dedicated to Goddess Devi.  Chandra Mahal  View of the Chandra Mahal from the Sarvato Bhadra courtyard. Seen at the top is the flag of the royal family. Chandra Mahal is one of the oldest buildings in the City Palace complex. It has seven floors, a number considered auspicious by Rajput rulers. The first two floors consist of the Sukh Niwas (the house of pleasure), followed by the Rang Mahal (alternatively called Shobha Niwas) with coloured glasswork, then Chhavi Niwas with its blue and white decorations. The last two floors are the Shri Niwas, and Mukut Mandir which is literally the crowning pavilion of this palace. The Mukut Mandir, with a bangaldar roof, has the royal standard of Jaipur hoisted at all times, as well as a quarter flag (underscoring the Sawai in the title) when the Maharaja is in residence. There is an anecdote narrated about the 'one and quarter flag', which is the insignia flag of the Maharajas of Jaipur. Emperor Aurangzeb who attended the wedding of Jai Singh, shook hands with the young groom and wished him well on his marriage. On this occasion, Jai Singh made an irreverent remark to the Emperor stating that the way he had shaken hands with him made it incumbent on the Emperor to protect him (Jai Singh) and his kingdom. Aurangzeb, instead of responding in indignation at the quip, felt pleased and conferred on the young Jai Singh the title of 'Sawai', which means \\"one and a quarter\\". Since then the Maharajas have pre-fixed their names with this title. During residence there, they also fly a one and a quarter size flag atop their buildings and palaces.  Mubarak Mahal  Mubarak Mahal The Mubarak Mahal courtyard at the City Palace was fully developed as late as 1900, when the court architect of the time, Lala Chiman Lal, constructed the Mubarak Mahal in its centre. Chiman Lal, had worked with Samuel Swinton Jacob, the State's executive engineer, and also built the Rajendra Pol around the same time as the Mubarak Mahal, complementing it in style. The facade of the Mubarak Mahal has a hanging balcony and is identical on all four sides, the intricate carving in white (andhi marble) and beige stone giving it the illusion of delicate decoupage. The Mubarak Mahal was built for receiving foreign guests but it now houses the museum offices and a library on the first floor and the museum's Textile Gallery on the ground floor.  The Clock Tower  Clock Tower, City Palace, Jaipur The clock tower is a structure to the south of the Sabha Niwas. It is a sign of European influence in the Rajput court as the clock was installed in a pre-existing tower in 1873. The clock, purchased from Black and Murray & Co. of Calcutta, aimed to introduce a little Victorian efficiency and punctuality into court proceedings.  Galleries of the museum   Sabha Niwas (Hall of Audience)  This is the main hall of audience. It is a large room with two thrones at the centre, a set of chairs around, as if in a durbar setting. On the walls of the halls are large format paintings of the Maharajas of Jaipur, a large picchwai (a backdrop for a shrine), large paintings depicting the colourful festival of holi, and a pair of paintings featuring spring and summer (possibly made in the Deccan). On display, you can also see military medals and polo trophies, marking the achievements of the rulers. The room is opulent in its decoration, with murals, and chandeliers. The current closed arches, on which the Holi paintings, and the Spring and Summer portrait hang, were closed in the recent times. Photos from the reign of Man Singh II, of the court in attendance, Lord and Lady Mountbatten's visit, line the corridor leading out to the Sarvato Bhadra courtyard.  Textile Gallery  This gallery is situated on the ground floor of the Mubarak Mahal. On display are various kinds of textiles and fabrics, including Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I's atmasukha, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh's wedding jama, and a set of robes (angarakhas) belonging to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II. Not to be missed is the rare pashmina carpet, made in Lahore or Kashmir around 1650. This gallery also has on display the Polo outfit and cups belonging Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and the billiards outfit of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II.  Sileh Khana (Arms and Armour Gallery)  The Sileh khana showcases the many arms used by the Kachhwaha Rajputs of Jaipur and Amber. The gallery has a variety of swords, guns, powder flasks, shields, helmets, archer's rings, even ivory back-scratching tools! The collection features early 19th century swords with a variety of decorations on the handle as well as sword blade or Shamshir Shikargah. According to Robert Elgood, two of such pieces on display have chiselled animals down the length of the blade (a concept acquired from Europe that allows decoration to a greater effect) the blade has raised figures, buildings, animals and birds all highlighted in gold. There is true damascening in gold on the hilt as well as the blades. These swords were never used and purely made for decorative purposes. The hilts of the pieces displayed are of different styles and can be accurately dated to the workshop set up for Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II ( r. 1880 ‚Äì 1922). Highlights of the collection are a tulwar owned by Maharaja Ram Singh Ji II (1835‚Äì80) (name inscribed on the blade) which had a blade length of 54cms ‚Äì bright steel, single-edged khanda blade with ricasso, shallow central fuller, and false edge. The blade is stamped at the forte with a Trishul and is heavier and shorter than normal indicating a special purpose. The gallery also showcases a tulwar which belonged to Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II (1912). The tulwar's hilt has chequered grip and pommel steel inlaid with silver flowers. Additionally, a beautifully painted shield featuring the clan goddess, Shila Mata, and hunting scenes, belonged to Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and is an exquisite object of the collection, and a must-see object. The case also has a child's turban in metal which mimics a fabric turban, and is a unique item. The armour section showcases helmets ‚Äì ‚ÄúKhud‚Äù. One of them is a 16th-century watered steel helmet which is rare to find. The helmet has been added with a false damascened band of decoration in the latter years of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II (19th century). Watered steel was extremely expensive and therefore used very sparingly.  Painting and photography gallery  One of the newest galleries at The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum is the Painting and Photography Gallery, where paintings and photographs from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Jaipur are showcased. This gallery highlights the ways in which traditional artistic practices were transformed by political and cultural changes, modern technologies, and new materials. Art historians have subdivided Rajput painting, a form of painting that developed in the sixteenth century, based on the kingdoms from within they emerged: Marwar, Mewar, and Dhundhar. Jaipur, the capital of the kingdom of Dhundhar, developed its own unique style of painting. At the same time, artistic exchanges between the Mughal and Rajput courts led to the development of new hybrid painting styles that brought together regional Indian, Mughal, and Persian traditions. This was especially prevalent within the courts of kingdoms that were closely allied with the Mughal imperial court, such as Amber and Jaipur. Currently, there are approximately 3,000 paintings housed in the MSMS II Museum, not including the paintings and manuscripts in the private collection of the royal family of Jaipur and in the kapad-dwara. These include original Mughal and Deccani paintings, Jaipur copies of Mughal paintings, paintings from other Rajput kingdoms, religious and secular paintings, illustrated manuscripts, small- and large-scale portraits, nature studies, paper-cut collages, and other miscellaneous subjects. Many of these are displayed in the Painting and Photography gallery. One of the most striking paintings in the collection is the artist Sahibram's large-scale composition of the Raas-lila. The painting is based on a re-enactment at the court, in which only women performed, even for the role of Krishna The photography collection at the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum consists of approximately 6,050 photographic prints, 1,941 glass plate negatives and photography equipment. This collection ranges from the 1860s to the 1950s and is unique due to its association with Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II, who was not only a collector and patron, but also a practitioner of photography. The photographic prints in the collection are mainly albumen and silver gelatin prints, on both printed and developed out paper. They consist of portraits, landscapes and architectural images and views of the Indian subcontinent by established photographers or studios such as Lala Deen Dayal, Jonston & Hoffman and Bourne & Shepherd. The glass plate negatives are primarily the work of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II or his studio ‚Äì the tasveerkhana ‚Äì and are wet collodion plates, which was the dominant technology in use from the 1850s‚Äì1880s. The bulk of the negatives in the collection are portraits, but they also include numerous landscapes of Jaipur and Amber and art objects such as paintings and sword hilts. The most distinctive part of the collection is the set of wet plate negatives that documents the zenana women, offering us a unique insight into the microcosm of the zenana. The photographic equipment in the collection belonged to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II and it appears to date from the 1860s. It includes the camera equipment and assorted accessories for practicing the wet plate collodion photography process.  Transport gallery  This gallery features pre-motorised transport like buggies, palkis, miyana, raths, camel saddles, etc. It is currently closed for renovation.

In 1965 he was named the first Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering. He became professor emeritus in 1968. MIT Solar House #1 (1939) Hottel was in charge of solar energy research program at MIT from the late 1930s to the mid-1960s. This involved research on non- biological uses of solar energy by humanity. The work led to develop the first accurate analytical models for solar heat collectors.Hoyt Hottel, Cambridge Forum Speakers Volume II at Harvard Square Library The modeling and testing work on led to what is currently known as the Hottel-Whillier model of the flat plate collector. During World War II, he was chief of the National Defense Research Committee group that studied and developed incendiaries. He chaired the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project Panel on Thermal Radiation from 1949-56. From 1956-67 he chaired the National Academy of Sciences Fire Research committee, which studied tactics to fight large fires, including forest fires and fire storms in urban areas. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. Hottel co-authored three books, contributed sections to 15 others and wrote more than 150 technical papers while acquiring eight patents. Awards Hottel received many distinguished professional awards, including the Medal for Merit in 1948, a civilian award, for \\"exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States\\" for his World War II service. The British government honoured him for his role in the war with the King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom. He also received the 1960 Sir Alfred Egerton Gold Medal from the Combustion Institute (which he co-founded) and the Melchett Medal from the Institute of Fuel in Great Britain. He received the Max Jakob Award from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1966 and the Founders Award from the Institute of Chemical Engineers the next year. In 1975 he received the Farrington Daniels Award of the International Solar Energy Society. In 1977 he was inducted in Solar hall of Fame. He continues to be remembered through the Hottel Lecture, the most prestigious award at the International Symposia of The Combustion Institute. MIT instituted the Hoyt C. Hottel Lectureship in 1985 and he delivered the inaugural lecture. The Hoyt C. Hottel Professorship in chemical engineering at MIT was established in 1995. The Hoyt Clarke Hottel Award is made each year by the American Solar Energy Society Awards Committee.

The film tells of a man who was abused as a child and, as a result, has no interest in having children of his own. When Adrian reveals to her husband that she is pregnant, her husband pressures her to have an abortion. Adrian rebuffs her husband's orders and he neglects her. The showrunner and Adrian's boss for the soap opera she writes and produces becomes romantically involved with her, eventually marrying her and helping Adrian raise her baby. John Ritter stars as the television producer, Polly Draper as Adrian, and Kevin Kilner portrays Adrian's husband. According to Hal Erickson, of Rovi, \\"the film was heavily criticized by time of its release, often called a 'yuppie love story.' \\"Review Summary The New York Times It also received an Emmy Award nomination in 1993 for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costuming for a Mini Series or a Special.  Plot  Bill Grant is a successful television producer working on the soap opera A Life Worth Living. He is a recently divorced man who does not see his sons very often. Unbeknownst to him, he constantly crosses paths with Adrian Towers, a career woman working as a writer for the news. She is married to Steven, a man who had an abusive childhood and therefore has no desire of having children. When she announces that she is pregnant, he forces her to have an abortion. She reluctantly agrees with him, but is unable to go forward with the termination. When Steven finds out, he leaves her, and threatens to file for divorce if she decides to keep the baby. Adrian has trouble accepting that Steven leaves her and refuses to talk about it to anyone. She soon becomes acquainted with Bill. Although she likes him a lot, she is still very upset over the divorce, which will be finalized only two weeks before she goes into delivery. She accompanies Bill on a camping trip with his two sons and soon notices how much she likes kids. Although she fails to tell him about her pregnancy, they get to know each other even more. He tells her that he once was afraid to become a father, but that it changed when he first held his sons. After admitting to her that he probably never could marry again, he tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming it is too soon for her. The next morning, Tommy, one of Bill's sons, is almost hit by a car. Adrian tries to save him and pushes him away, only to be hit herself. She is injured and hospitalized, and risks to suffer a miscarriage. Bill soon learns about her pregnancy and she immediately informs him about everything concerning what has happened. He is scared by this news, but continues to support her. However, he admits that he is afraid he will fall in love with her and that she will return to Steven. Later, her lawyer informs her that Steven has no desire of ever seeing his baby and wants her to sign a contract, in which he promises to support her financially, on condition that he won't be responsible for the baby. Adrian refuses to sign it, claiming that he has to see his baby before making that decision. Crushed, she finds comfort with Bill and they end up becoming a romantic couple. A few months pass by. Adrian notices Steven in a restaurant and decides to confront him, but he refuses to speak to her. Bill advises her to accept that there is no future with Steven. The next day, she is hospitalized for having contractions too early. A short time later, she decides to give in to the divorce and is proposed to by Bill. She accepts his proposal, but makes it clear that she is still not over her marriage with Steven. On Christmas Eve, Adrian gives birth to a boy, who she names Sam. Steven agrees to see him and admits that he wants to renew their relationship for their child's sake. Adrian, however, rejects him. Bill, having seen Steven with her, keeps his distance. They are reunited and married in the end, when Adrian assures him that he is the only one for her.

Nautical Chart of Carriacou from 1891 Early years Between 400 and 100 BC, stone age people from South America introduced the psychedelic drug cohoba into the island. Between 500 and 1000 AD another wave of settlers came to Carriacou. By 1000 AD the Arawaks were living on the island. Some time later, the Caribs settled there, conquering or displacing the earlier inhabitants. European discovery *In 1656 the first European to visit the island was the Frenchman P√®re du Tertre, a turtle fisherman from Guadeloupe. In his history of the Antilles he said, ‚ÄúThe most beautiful of all the little isles is Carriacou...‚Äù *In the 18th century, cotton, sugar and indigo plantations were established on the island by the English. They also built water channels which brought water from the hills for use in irrigation. *In 1720, the pirate Bartholomew Roberts captured a French ship near Carriacou and commandeered it, renaming it Royal Fortune. *In 1750, the first census of the island was conducted. There were 199 people living there, 92 whites, 92 blacks and 15 mulattos. British Empire *In 1763 Carriacou was ceded with Grenada to the British and became part of the British Empire. *Before 1769 there was an attempt to produce indigo at the Meldrum Estate. *On the 22 June 1770, Captain John Urquhart bought Grand Anse Estate Plantation. *In 1776, the island population was 3,239 (86 whites and 3,153 slaves) people, not counting the free blacks and the free mulattos. *The estate of Cistern began construction in 1782. *Between 1783‚Äì1793 it was established that the glebe land belonged to the priest. *The estate of Cistern was completed in 1786. *In 1788 the Craigston and Meldrum Estates were the property of William Urquhart of Craigston. *About 1790 a ship from Glasgow, Scotland came to Carriacou. *In 1790 there were 46 estates in Carriacou. *In 1791, Gun Point (Rapid Point) which had been a division of the Grenadines was made latitude on the island, but the point belonged to Saint Vincent and the rest of Carriacou belonged to Grenada. *In 1793 there were 23 estates on the island, of which the Craigston, Meldrum and Prospect estates were the largest. *In 1796 there were a large number of sailing vessels in Hillsborough Bay when Sir Ralph Abercromby met there to launch an attack on the Spanish. *In 1769‚Äì1815 the Craigston estate became a cotton plantation. *In the 19th century, the Pierrot Mas was first introduced to Carriacou. *In 1810 the Belvedere great house was built. Slavery abolished *In 1870, Stephen Joseph Perry was in charge of a government expedition to observe a solar eclipse at Carriacou. *In 1891 a few wells were sunk to find ground water. *In 1902 the Harvey Vale was divided into 244 lots. *On March 2, 1914 a Black man name Samuel Corion (Planter) bought Grand Anse Estate from Henry St. Barbe Goldsmith of London and Smith Bank Chancery Lane, London. *In 1920 limes were grown commercially on Carriacou until the turn of the 20th century, but they became unprofitable so many of the groves were abandoned and production was transferred to Grenada. A well was built to provide a constant source of water for livestock at Limlair. *In 1922, Petite Charles first introduced the Jab Jab (Devil) Mas to Carriacou. *The estate of Cistern was bought by George Kent in 1927. *In 1941 there was estimated to be at around 4 inches of rainfall per month. *The Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses were established on the island in 1951 and the Evangelists in 1956. *In 1960 Herbert Blaize became the first chief minister of Grenada to come from Carriacou. *The telephone system began operating in 1961 on the island of Carriacou. *Bishop's College was the first Secondary School in Carriacou; it was opened in 1964 by the Anglican Church. *In 1965, the Carriacou Regatta was first held. *In 1968, Lauriston airport was opened. Independence *Grenada obtained its independence from the United Kingdom on Thursday 7 February 1974. *On October 31, 1975 the Carriacou Carib Organization (Big Drum Dance Organization) was started. *In 1977 Betsy Traylor was the first warden of the Carriacou Museum on Paterson Street. *The lime factory (Craigston Great House) is the most historical landmark and was in operation until 1981. *In 1983 Nicholas Brathwaite became the first Prime Minister of Grenada to have originated in Carriacou. *In 1992 there was a Spiritual battle from the first day, bringing Gospel to Windward Church. *In 1998 the land use plan for Carriacou and Petite Martinique put it under the 1988 OAS System plan. *In 1999 Hurricane Lenny caused considerable damage to the island. After 2000 *In 2001 a reconstruction of the major commercial road network island-wide was undertaken. *In 2005 Hurricane Emily caused strong winds and heavy rainfall on the island. *In 2008 Rawle Paterson was the first Carriacouan and Caribbean person to receive a top award at a Chinese university (the university he attended was the in Beijing) *On Tuesday, 27 May 2008 the New National Party (NNP) Grenada organised the largest gathering in Carriacou history at the Digg Playing Field in Harvey Vale and there were 7,000 people (green clad) at the event.

Numerous leagues or organizations tend to send a laundry list of rules in order to better distinguish themselves from their counterparts. American football (general) Field and players American football is played on a football field that is 100 yards in total. . The longer boundary lines are sidelines, while the shorter boundary lines are end lines. Sidelines and end lines are out of bounds. Near each end of the field is a goal line; they are apart. A scoring area called an end zone extends beyond each goal line to each end line. The end zone includes the goal line but not the end line. While the playing field is effectively flat, it is common for a field to be built with a slight crown‚Äîwith the middle of the field higher than the sides‚Äîto allow water to drain from the field. Yard lines cross the field every , and are numbered every 10 yards from each goal line to the 50-yard line, or midfield (similar to a typical rugby league field). Two rows of short lines, known as inbounds lines or hash marks, run at 1-yard (91.4 cm) intervals perpendicular to the sidelines near the middle of the field. All plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks. Because of the arrangement of the lines, the field is occasionally referred to as a gridiron. At the back of each end zone are two goalposts (also called uprights) connected by a crossbar from the ground. For high skill levels, the posts are apart. For lower skill levels, these are widened to . Each team has 11 players on the field at a time. However, teams may substitute for any or all of their players, if time allows, during the break between plays. As a result, players have very specialized roles, and, sometimes (although rarely) almost all of the (at least) 46 active players on an NFL team will play in any given game. Thus, teams are divided into three separate units: the offense, the defense and the special teams. Start of halves Similarly to association football, the game begins with a coin toss to determine which team will kick off to begin the game and which goal each team will defend. The options are presented again to start the second half; the choices for the first half do not automatically determine the start of the second half (i.e. it is possible for the same team to kick off both halves). But, this ordinarily does not happen. Normally, the two halves are not both kicked off by the same team. The referee conducts the coin toss with the captains (or sometimes coaches) of the opposing teams. The team that wins the coin toss has three options: # They may choose whether to kick or receive the opening kickoff. # They may choose which goal to defend. # They may choose to defer the first choice to the other team and have first choice to start the second half. Whatever the first team chooses, the second team has the option on the other choice (for example, if the first team elects to receive at the start of the game, the second team can decide which goal to defend). At the start of the second half, the options to kick, receive, or choose a goal to defend are presented to the captains again. The team which did not choose first to start the first half (or which deferred its privilege to choose first) now gets first choice of options. Game duration A standard football game consists of four 15-minute quarters (12-minute quarters in high-school football and often shorter at lower levels, usually one minute per grade [e.g. 9-minute quarters for freshman games]), with a 12-minute half-time intermission (30 minutes in Super Bowl) after the second quarter in the NFL (college halftimes are 20 minutes; in high school the interval is 15 or 20 minutes; 10 minutes for lower grades). The clock stops after certain plays; therefore, a game can last considerably longer (often more than three hours in real time), and if a game is broadcast on television, TV timeouts are taken at certain intervals of the game to broadcast commercials outside of game action. If an NFL game is tied after four quarters, the teams play an additional period, timed like the fourth quarter, lasting up to 10 minutes. There is a coin toss in the NFL just like the beginning of the game. If the receiving team scores a touchdown during the possession, they win. If they kick a field goal, then the other team gets a possession. If they score a touchdown, they win. If they tie the score by kicking a field goal, then the next team that scores wins. If the team with the first possession turns the ball over without scoring any points, then the first team to score, wins. If the defense scores a touchdown through an interception or fumble recovery, or they get a safety, then they win. In a regular-season NFL game, if no one scores in the overtime, the game ends tied. In an NFL playoff game, multiple 15-minute overtime periods are played, as needed, to determine a winner. These periods are timed as if a game had started over. In the extremely rare case a game would go as far as a third OT‚Äîwhich has never happened in the NFL‚Äîthere would be no \\"halftime intermission\\"; play would resume with a kickoff similar to a normal third quarter. College overtime rules are more complicated and are described in Overtime (sport). Advancing the ball Advancing the ball in American football resembles the six-tackle rule and the play-the-ball in rugby league. The team that takes possession of the ball (the offense) has four attempts, called downs, in which to advance the ball toward their opponent's (the defense's) end zone. When the offense succeeds in gaining at least 10 yards, it gets a first down, meaning the team has another set of four downs to gain yet another 10 yards or to score. If the offense fails to gain a first down (10 yards) after 4 downs, the other team gets possession of the ball at the point where the fourth down ended, beginning with their first down to advance the ball in the opposite direction. Except at the beginning of halves and after scores, the ball is always put into play by a snap. Offensive players line up facing defensive players at the line of scrimmage (the position on the field where the play begins). One offensive player, the center, then passes (or \\"snaps\\") the ball backwards between his legs to a teammate behind him, usually the quarterback. Players can then advance the ball in two ways: # By running with the ball, also known as rushing. # By throwing the ball to a teammate, known as a forward pass or as passing the football. The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian football from other football sports. The offense can throw the ball forward only once during a down and only from behind the line of scrimmage. The ball can be thrown, pitched, handed-off, or tossed sideways or backwards at any time. A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following: * The player with the ball is forced to the ground (a tackle) or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team (as determined by an official). * A forward pass flies beyond the dimensions of the field (out of bounds) or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an incomplete pass. The ball is returned to the most recent line of scrimmage for the next down. * The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds. * A team scores. Officials blow a whistle to notify players that the down is over. Before each down, each team chooses a play, or coordinated movements and actions, that the players should follow on a down. Sometimes, downs themselves are referred to as \\"plays.\\" Change of possession The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things occurs: * The team fails to get a first down-- i.e., in four downs they fail to move the ball past a line 10 yards ahead of where they got their last first down (it is possible to be downed behind the current line of scrimmage, losing \\"yardage\\"). The defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the 4th-down play ends. A change of possession in this manner is commonly called a turnover on downs, but is not credited as a defensive \\"turnover\\" in official statistics. Instead, it goes against the offense's 4th down efficiency percentage. * The offense scores a touchdown or field goal. The team that scored then kicks the ball to the other team in a special play called a kickoff. * The offense punts the ball to the defense. A punt is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground. Punts are nearly always made on fourth down (though see quick kick), when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field (through a failed attempt to make a first down) and feels it is too far from the other team's goal posts to attempt a field goal. * A defensive player catches a forward pass. This is called an interception, and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until he is tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores. * An offensive player drops the ball (a fumble) and a defensive player picks it up. As with interceptions, a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores. Backward passes that are not caught do not cause the down to end like incomplete forward passes do; instead the ball is still live as if it had been fumbled. Lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as turnovers. * The offensive team misses a field goal attempt. The defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began (or, in the NFL, at the spot of the kick). If the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within of the end zone, the other team gets the ball at its own 20-yard line (that is, 20 yards from the end zone). If a field goal is missed or blocked and the ball remains in the field of play, a defensive player may pick up the ball and attempt to advance it. * While in his own end zone, an offensive ball carrier is tackled, forced out of bounds, loses the ball out of bounds, or the offense commits certain fouls. This fairly rare occurrence is called a safety. * An offensive ball carrier fumbles the ball forward into the opposing end zone, and then the ball goes out of bounds. This extremely rare occurrence leads to a touchback, with the ball going over to the opposing team at their 20-yard line (Note that touchbacks during non-offensive special teams plays, such as punts and kickoffs, are quite common). Scoring A team scores points by the following plays: * A touchdown (TD) is worth 6 points. It is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent's end zone. A touchdown is analogous to a try in rugby. Unlike rugby, a player does not have to touch the ball to the ground to score; a touchdown is scored any time a player has possession of the ball but not while the ball is on or beyond the opponents' goal line (or the plane above it). ** After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a try (which is also analogous to the conversion in rugby). The ball is placed at the other team's line (the line in the NFL on 2-point conversions or for 1-point conversions). The team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for 1 point (an extra point or point-after touchdown (PAT)), or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for 2 points (a two-point conversion). In college football, the NFL, and Texas high school football, if the defense intercepts or recovers a fumble during a one or two-point conversion attempt and returns it to the opposing end zone, the defensive team is awarded the two points. * A field goal (FG) is worth 3 points, and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts (uprights). Field goals may be placekicked (kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate) or drop-kicked (extremely uncommon in the modern game, with only two successes in sixty-plus years in the NFL). A field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the opponent's goal line, or, when there is little or no time left to otherwise score. A fair catch kick is also 3. * A safety, worth 2 points, is scored by the opposing team when the team in possession at the end of a down is responsible for the ball becoming dead behind its own goal line. For instance, a safety is scored by the defense if an offensive player is tackled, goes out of bounds, or fumbles the ball out of bounds in his own end zone. Safeties are relatively rare. Note that, though even more rare, the team initially on offense during a down can score a safety if a player of the original defense gains possession of the ball in front of his own goal line and then carries the ball or fumbles it into his own end zone where it becomes dead. However, if the ball becomes dead behind the goal line of the team in possession and its opponent is responsible for the ball being there (for instance, if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its own end zone and the ball becomes dead before the ball is advanced out of the end zone) it is a touchback: no points are scored and the team last in possession keeps possession with a first down at its own 20-yard line. In amateur and pro football, in the extremely rare instance that a safety is scored on a try, it is worth only 1 point. Kickoffs and free kicks Each half begins with a kickoff. Teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals. The ball is kicked using a kicking tee from the team's own line in the NFL and college football (as of the 2011 season). The other team's kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible. Where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its drive, or series of offensive plays. If the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone, he can either run with the ball, or elect for a touchback by kneeling in the end zone, in which case the receiving team then starts its offensive drive from its own 20-yard line (25-yard line in NFL, since 2015). A touchback also occurs when the kick goes out-of-bounds in the end zone, or since 2018, the ball hits the ground on the goal line and in the end zone. A kickoff that goes out-of-bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is a foul, and the ball will be placed where it went out of bounds or from the kickoff spot, depending on which is more advantageous to the opposite team. Unlike with punts, once a kickoff goes 10 yards and the ball has hit the ground, it can be recovered by the kicking team. A team, especially one who is losing, can try to take advantage of this by attempting an onside kick. Punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in a touchback. After safeties, the team that gave up the points must free kick the ball to the other team from its own 20-yard line. Penalties Fouls (a type of rule violation) are punished with penalties against the offending team. Most penalties result in moving the football towards the offending team's end zone. If the penalty would move the ball more than half the distance towards the offender's end zone, the penalty becomes half the distance to the goal instead of its normal value. Most penalties result in replaying the down. Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down. Conversely, some offensive penalties result in loss of a down (loss of the right to repeat the down). If a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down, they get a first down, as usual. If a foul occurs during a down, an official throws a yellow penalty flag near the spot of the foul. When the down ends, the team that did not commit the foul has the option of accepting the penalty, or declining the penalty and accepting the result of the down. Variations Variations on these basic rules exist, particularly touch and flag football, which are designed as non- contact or limited-contact alternatives to the relative violence of regular American football. In touch and flag football, tackling is not permitted. Offensive players are \\"tackled\\" when a defender tags them or removes a flag from their body, respectively. Both of these varieties are played mainly in informal settings such as intramural or youth games. Another variation is \\"wrap\\", where a player is \\"tackled\\" when another player wraps his arms around the ball carrier. Professional, intercollegiate, and varsity-level high school football invariably use the standard tackling rules. Another variation is with the number of players on the field. In sparsely populated areas, it is not uncommon to find high school football teams playing nine-man football, eight- man football or six-man football. Players often play on offense as well as defense. The Arena Football League was a league that played eight-man football, but also had played indoors and on a much smaller playing surface with rule changes to encourage a much more offensive game. Another variation often played by American children is called Catch and Run. In this game, the children split into two teams and line up at opposite sides of the playing field. One side throws the ball to the other side. If the opposing team catches the ball, that player tries to run to the throwing teams touchdown without being tagged/tackled. If no one catches the ball or if the player is tagged/tackled, then that team has to throw the ball to the opposing team. This repeats until the game (or recess period) is deemed over. Canadian football (general) The field The Canadian football field is long and wide with end zones deep. At each goal line is a set of goalposts, which consist of two uprights joined by a crossbar which is above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts above the ground) is preferred. The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every from the goal line.Table of exact conversions {|class=wikitable |- !height=30pt|yards |align=right|1 |align=right|5 |align=rightalign=right|10 |align=rightalign=right|15 |align=right|20 |align=right|24 |align=right|25 |align=right|30 |align=right|35 |align=right|40 |align=right|45 |align=right|65 |align=right|110 |- !height=30pt|feet |align=right|3 |align=right|15 |align=rightalign=right|30 |align=right|40 |align=right|45 |align=right|60 |align=right|72 |align=right|75 |align=right|90 |align=right|105 |align=right|120 |align=right|135 |align=right|195 |align=right|330 |- !height=30pt|metres |align=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=rightalign=right} Play of the game Teams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, prolate spheroid ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes. Kickoff Play begins with one team place-kicking the ball from its own line. Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or throw the ball to a teammate, so long as the throw is not forward. Stoppage of play Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move. If no score has been made, the next play starts from scrimmage. Scrimmage Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it became dead, but no nearer than from the sideline or from the goal line. The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is a sort of \\"no-man's land\\"; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage. Live play On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence. Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to the quarterback or punter. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following: * run with the ball, attempting to run farther downfield (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards). * drop-kick the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is exceedingly rare in both Canadian and American football, although in the Canadian game it is sometimes used as a last-second \\"desperation play\\" if the team is behind by less than three points.) * pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a lateral, and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a forward pass (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals. * hand-off‚Äîhand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback. * punt the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it before it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the No Yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays). * place the ball on the ground for a place kick * throw a forward pass, where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther downfield (closer to the opponent's goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions: ** They must be made from behind the line of scrimmage ** Only one forward pass may be made on a play ** The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver. Each play constitutes a down. The offence must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a field goal (see below), depending on their position on the field. Change in possession The ball changes possession in the following instances: * If the offence scores a field goal, the scoring team must kickoff from their own line. * If the offence scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own line. This also applies when the defence scores on a turnover which is returned for a touchdown ‚Äî technically, they become the offence until the conclusion of the play, and the scoring team must still kickoff. * If the defence scores on a safety, they have the right to claim possession. * If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession. * If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defense takes over on downs. * If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is intercepted by the defense; the defense takes possession immediately (and may try and advance the ball on the play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team. * If the offence fumbles (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety. * If the offence has committed two consecutive time counts ‚Äî failed to put the ball in play within 20 seconds of the referee declaring the ball ready for play ‚Äî on third down in the last three minutes of either half, the referee has the right to give possession to the defence. (This rule does not apply on convert attempts, which are untimed downs.) * When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half may receive a kickoff to start the second half. Rules of contact There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (as opposed to in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled. Infractions and penalties Infractions of the rules are punished with penalties, typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or against the penalized team. Minor violations such as offside (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized , and severe violations (such as face-masking) of the rules are typically penalized . Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, the spot the violation occurred, or the place the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach in order to reach first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down. Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offsides), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as unsportsmanlike conduct). Penalties never result in a score for the offence (a penalty by the defence committed in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown); on rare occasions, penalties against the offence in their own end zone may result in a safety being scored by the defence. If the penalty yardage, once assessed would move the ball into an end zone (or further than half the distance between the end zone and the spot the penalty is assessed from), a penalty of half-the-distance is assessed instead. Note that in Canadian football (unlike American football), no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line. In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of declining the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs; the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. (After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback). Kicking Canadian football distinguishes three ways of kicking the ball: ; Place kick : Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), placed on a tee. ; Drop kick : Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's rugby heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adapted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare. ; Punt : Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time. On punts and field goal attempts (but not kickoffs), members of the kicking team, other than the kicker and any teammates who are onside (behind the kicker at the time of the kick), may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team. Scoring The methods of scoring are: ; Touchdown : Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent's goal area, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent's goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a \\"major score\\" or simply a \\"major.\\" ; Conversion (or Convert) : After a touchdown, the team that scored attempts one scrimmage play from any point between the hash marks on or outside the opponents' line. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point; what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a \\"two-point conversion\\"). No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below). ; Field goal : Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points. ; Safety : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a single (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team's own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), and they begin their first down possession play from their own line on their side of the field. ; Single : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead- line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score. :Officially, the single is called a rouge (French for \\"red\\") but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signaled with a red flag. Resumption of play Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score. * Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own line (45-yard line in amateur leagues). * Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own line. * Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own line. * Following a single or rouge, play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, in which case the non- scoring team scrimmages from either the line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, whichever is greater. Game timing The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half. A 2-minute interval occurs after the end of each quarter (15 minutes at halftime, except 30 minutes in Grey Cup), and the two teams then change goals. In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when: * points are scored, * the ball goes out of bounds, * a forward pass is incomplete, * the ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown, * the ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation), * the ball is dead and a player is injured, or * the ball is dead and a captain calls a time-out. The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick). In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play * the ball was kicked off, * the ball was punted, * the ball changed possession, * the ball went out of bounds, * there were points scored, * there was an incomplete forward pass, * there was a penalty applied (not declined), or * there was a team time-out. The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non- penalized team has the option to decline any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing penalties. In the event of a tie after regulation, teams get one possession from the opponents' 35-yard line. The overtime is untimed. Coin toss determines whether team receives first or defend; the teams turn about for the next overtime possession, if needed. Whoever is ahead after one possession wins it and two points in standings; if after two possessions in the regular season or preseason, a tie still persists, the game ends drawn, and one point in standings; however, in postseason, multiple overtime possessions are repeated until whoever is up, which wins the game. If a touchdown has been scored they must make a two-point conversion, unless they score enough beat their opponents. College football Teams get 3 timeouts per half, which can't carry over to next half or overtime, plus one per overtime period (same as in the NFL, but allows two per overtime period). Although rules for the high school, college, and NFL games are generally consistent, there are several minor differences. The NCAA Football Rules Committee determines the playing rules for Division I (both Bowl and Championship Subdivisions), II, and III games (the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) is a separate organization, but uses the NCAA rules). *A pass is ruled complete if one of the receiver's feet is inbounds at the time of the catch. In the NFL both feet must be inbounds. *A player is considered down when any part of his body other than the feet or hands touches the ground (from a tackle or otherwise), with the sole exception of the holder for field goal and extra point attempts. In the NFL a player is active until he is tackled or forced down another way by a member of the opposing team (down by contact). *The clock stops after the offense completes a first down and begins again‚Äîassuming it is following a play in which the clock would not normally stop‚Äîonce the referee declares the ball ready for play. In the NFL the clock does not explicitly stop for a first down. *Overtime was introduced in 1996, eliminating ties. Since 2019, during overtime, each team is given one possession from its opponent's twenty-five yard line with no game clock, despite the one timeout per period and use of play clock; the procedure repeats for the next three possessions if needed; all possessions thereafter will be from the opponent's 3-yard line. Whoever leads after both possessions will be declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, overtime periods continue, with a coin flip determining the first possession. Possessions alternate with each overtime, until one team leads the other at the end of the overtime. Starting with triple overtime, a one-point PAT field goal after a touchdown is no longer allowed, forcing teams to attempt a two-point conversion after a touchdown. After quadruple overtime, two-point conversions are employed thereafter. (In the NFL, overtime is decided by a 10-minute sudden-death quarter, and regular season games can still end in a tie if neither team scores. Overtime for regular season games in the NFL began with the season, but reduced since . In the post-season & Pro Bowl, if the teams are still tied, teams will play multiple 15-minute overtime periods until whoever scores.) *Extra point tries are attempted from the three-yard line. The NFL uses the 2-yard line for 2-point conversions or 15-yard line for 1-point conversions. *The defensive team may score two points on a point-after touchdown attempt by returning a blocked kick, fumble, or interception into the opposition's end zone. In addition, if the defensive team gains possession, but then moves backwards into the endzone and is stopped, a one- point safety will be awarded to the offense, although, unlike a real safety, the offense kicks off, opposed to the team charged with the safety. In the NFL, a conversion attempt ends when the defending team gains possession of the football. *The two-minute warning is not used in college football, except in rare cases where the scoreboard clock has malfunctioned and is not being used. *There is an option to use instant replay review of officiating decisions. Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools use replay in virtually all games; replay is rarely used in lower division games. Every play is subject to booth review with coaches only having one challenge. In the NFL, challenges are only automatic in the final two minutes of each half or the entire overtime. *In the 2006 season, the game clock was started when the ball was declared ready for play after the defensive team (during a scrimmage down) or the receiving kick (during a free kick down) was awarded a first down, reducing the time of games. This rule only lasted one year. *In the 1984 season, the ball was placed on the 30-yard line (instead of the 20) if a kickoff sailed through the end zone on the fly and untouched. This rule was rescinded after one year. *Among other rule changes to 2007, kickoffs have been moved from the 35-yard line back five yards to the 30-yard line to match that of the NFL. Some coaches and officials are questioning this rule change as it could lead to more injuries to the players as there will likely be more kickoff returns. The rationale for the rule change was to help reduce dead time in the game. However, the NFL would move its kickoffs back to the 35-yard line for the 2011 season; the NCAA followed suit one year later. * Since the 2012 college football season, all touchbacks on kickoffs, or free kicks after a safety, have been spotted on the 25-yard line instead of the previous 20-yard spot (which remains the spot for touchbacks in all other game situations). The NFL made this same change effective with its 2018 season. In that same 2018 season, college football (but not the NFL) made a further change to its touchback rule; any fair catch on a kickoff (or free kick following a safety) between the receiving team's goal line and 25-yard line is treated as a touchback, with the receiving team taking possession on its own 25. See also *Sprint Football High school football The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) establishes the rules of High School Football. Only Texas uses NCAA playing rules. With their common ancestry, the NFHS rules of high school football are largely similar to the college game, though with some important differences: * The four quarters are each 12 minutes, as opposed to 15 minutes in all other forms of the game; this includes Texas (all games). * Kickoffs take place at the kicking team's 40-yard line, as opposed to the 35 in college and the NFL. This rule is also used by Texas. * If a ball crosses the plane of the goal line on a missed field goal, it would be a touchback and the opposing team will start at the 20-yard line. In Texas, the ball goes back to the line of scrimmage, except if the line of scrimmage was inside the 20-yard line, in which case, the ball is returned to the 20. * Any kick crossing the goal line is automatically a touchback; kicks cannot be returned out of the end zone. * Pass interference by the defense results in a 15-yard penalty, regardless of where the foul occurred (unlike the pro ranks where the ball is placed at the spot of the foul). (Like any other distance penalty, enforcement will not move the ball more than half the distance to the defense's goal line.) * The defense cannot return an extra-point attempt for a score, except in Texas. * The use of overtime, and the type of overtime used, is up to the individual state associations. In Texas, triple & quadruple overtime employs two-point conversions after touchdown; quintuple overtime & thereafter employs two-point conversions, all like the NCAA. * Intentional grounding may be called even if the quarterback is outside the tackle box. In Texas, once the quarterback leaves the tackle box, he only needs to throw the ball past the line of scrimmage to avoid this penalty. * The home team must wear dark-colored jerseys, and the visiting team must wear white jerseys. In the NFL, as well as conference games in the Southeastern Conference, the home team has choice of jersey color. Under general NCAA rules, the home team may wear white with approval of the visiting team. * NFHS rules specifically prohibit the use of replay review, even if the venue has the facilities to support it. In Texas, the public-school sanctioning body, the University Interscholastic League, only allows replay review in state championship games, while the main body governing non-public schools, the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, follows the NFHS in banning replay review. At least one high school rule has been adopted by college football. In 1996, the overtime rules originally utilized by Kansas high school teams were adopted by the NCAA, except with the starting point at the 25-yard line instead of the 10-yard line as prescribed in the NFHS rules, but under NFHS rules, states may opt to start each period from another point (such as the 20 or 25). See also *Six-man football *Eight-man football *Nine-man football Indoor football Play in all forms of indoor football has tended to emphasize the forward passing game at the expense of rushing the football. Whereas in a typical National Football League game perhaps half of the total offensive plays are rushing plays and 35 or 40 per cent of all of the yardage gained comes from rushing plays, in Arena and other indoor football it is far more common for rushing plays to constitute only 10 per cent of the offense, or even less in some instances. World Series of Pro Football The first documented indoor football games were those played at Madison Square Garden in 1902 and 1903 known as the \\"World Series of Pro Football.\\" They were the first efforts at a national professional football championship. The games were played on a 70-yard by 35-yard dirt field but otherwise adhered to outdoor rules. Poor attendance led to the tournament being discontinued for 1904. Madison Square Garden had to be redone to accommodate the teams. The wooden flooring of the arena was removed and replaced by an earthen surface. The goal lines were only 70 yards apart and the playing field was only 35 yards wide. (Since was in the era before the forward pass, there were no end zones, as they had not yet been invented.) The earthen surface became sticky as the game progressed and made for some tough maneuvering, while the stands were right up to the playing field and proved to be a physical hazard.http://www.footballhistorian.com/football_heroes.cfm?page=8 The kicking game was also drastically affected. In a game on a normal field, the team with the longest punts had the advantage. However, the Gardens proved to be a dream for a weak punter, due to the field size. Also the arena wall was right on the edge of the field, presenting a serious hazard on any sideline plays. One player knocked himself out of the tournament by running into the wall on the opening kickoff. 1932 NFL Playoff Game in Chicago Stadium The first major indoor football game was the 1932 NFL Playoff Game, which was played indoors in the Chicago Stadium due to a severe blizzard that prevented playing the game outside. A dirt floor was brought in, and to compensate for the 80-yard length of the field, the teams' positions were reset back twenty yards upon crossing midfield. Arena Football League * The Field: An indoor padded surface wide and long with endzones. Goal posts are wide with a crossbar height of (NFL goalposts are wide with the crossbar at ). The goalside rebound nets are wide by high. The bottom of the nets are above the ground. Sideline barriers are high and made of high density foam rubber. * The Equipment: The official football is the same size and weight as the National Football League ball. * The Players and Formations: Eight players on the field; 21-man active roster; four-man inactive roster. * Substitution: Free substitution is allowed, but some players play both ways either by choice or to step in because of injury. * Formation: Four (4) offensive players must line up on the line of scrimmage. Three (3) defensive players must be down linemen (in a three or four-point stance). Only the \\"Mac Linebacker\\" may blitz on either side of the center. Alignment is two (2) or more yards off the line of scrimmage. No stunting or twisting. Offensive motion in the backfield: One receiver may go in a forward motion before the snap. * Timing: Four 15-minute quarters with a 15-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in ArenaBowl). The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays or incomplete passes only in the last half-minute of regulation & overtime or when the referee deems it necessary for penalties, injuries or timeouts; as in the NFL, any injury in last half- minute of regulation or overtime costs that team a timeout, unless they have none and this occurs, when they are granted one. Each team is allowed three (3) time-outs per half, and two per overtime period if regulation ends tied. In the last half-minute of the game, the clock will run if team has lead and quarterback decides to kneel down. 30-second play clock. * Movement of the Ball and Scoring: Four (4) downs are allowed to advance the ball ten (10) yards for a first down, or to score. Six (6) points for a touchdown. One (1) point for a conversion by place kick after a touchdown or if safety is scored off any conversion attempt, two (2) points for a conversion by drop kick and two (2) points for successful run or pass after a touchdown. Three (3) points for a field goal or fair catch kick by placement or four (4) points by drop kick. Two (2) points for safeties or defending team's turnover off conversion attempt returned for touchdown. * Kicking: Kickoffs are from the goal line. Kickers may use a one-inch tee. Punting is illegal. On fourth down, a team may go for a first down, touchdown or field goal. The receiving team may field any kickoff or missed field goal that rebounds off the net. Any kickoff untouched which is out of bounds or hitting an overhead structure (i.e. scoreboard) will be placed at the 20-yard line or the place where it went out of bounds, whichever is more advantageous to the receiving team. If a kickoff goes beyond the end zone and stays in bounds (such as kicking it into the field goal \\"slack net\\" or if the ball goes under the net), the ball will come out to the 5-yard line. The same is true if a missed field goal attempt goes beyond the end zone and under the net. If the receiving player chooses not to take the ball out of the endzone (takes a knee) or is tackled in the endzone, the ball is placed on the 2¬Ω-yard line. * Passing: Passing rules in Arena Football are the same as outdoor NCAA football in which receivers must have one foot inbounds. A unique exception involves the rebound nets. A forward pass that rebounds off of the endzone net is a live ball and is in play until it touches the playing surface. * Overtime Rules: Overtime periods are 15 minutes during the regular season and the playoffs. In the first overtime each team gets one possession to score. Whoever is ahead after one possession will win. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, whoever scores next will win. Multiple overtime periods will be played in case of a tie and play continues in true sudden death thereafter. This includes both games of all semifinal series. * Coaching challenges: coaches are allowed 2 (two) challenges per game; to do so, coaches throw the red flag before the next play. If the play stands as called after the play is reviewed they lose a timeout; however, if it is reversed they keep their timeouts. If a team wins two straight challenges they are granted a third. All challenges are automatic in the final half-minute of regulation & all overtime periods, as does scoring plays & turnovers. * Defending players may not jump offside twice in either half; they risk ejection for rest of half if they do. They cannot jump offside during overtime, or they risk immediate disqualification. This penalty is enforced besides yardage penalty. * Any player who targets, such as using the helmet to ram opponents, risk immediate disqualification plus a 15-yard penalty. American Indoor Football Association *The AIFA does not use the rebound net found in the Arena Football League. *One linebacker may move flat to flat but must stay in drop zone. *Platooning and free substitution is allowed, meaning players do not have to play both offense and defense. *Franchises must have at least 9 players that originate from within a 120-mile radius of the team's home town. *The AIFA ball pattern is similar to that of the basketball in the American Basketball Association, with red, white, and blue panels as opposed to the brown colored football of most leagues. Two rule changes appear to be inspired by Canadian football rules: *Two offensive players may be in motion at one time. The AFL allows only one in motion. *The AIFA recognizes the single (also known as an uno or rouge). If a kickoff goes through the uprights, or if the receiving team does not advance the ball out of the end zone on a kickoff, the kicking team is awarded one point and the ball is spotted at the opponent's five-yard line. Continental Indoor Football League Field Size ‚Äì 50 yards long by 25 yards wide, with end zones a minimum of 5 yards in depth. Fields may vary in size due to physical constraints within facility, with CIFL permission. End zones may be rounded due to hockey board configurations. Padded dasher board walls around the entire field that act as an extension of the ground (only \\"out of bounds\\" if contact made by opposing player that forces player into the dasher wall, much like a ‚Äòdown by contact‚Äô rule). Goal Posts ‚Äì Goal posts are 12 feet from the floor to the crossbar. The crossbar is 10 feet wide. Anything used to hang the goalpost is considered a part of the upright. Number Of Players ‚Äì Seven players per team on the field at one time. Maximum of 20 active players with a 21st player that is only eligible for special-teams plays (kickoffs, field goals, point-after-touchdown plays). Playing Time ‚Äì Four 15-minute quarters with a running clock. Clock only stops for incomplete passes and out of bounds plays during the final minute of the halves. 25-second play clock. Scoring ‚Äì 6 points for TD, 2 points for run or pass conversion, or drop kick PAT, 1 point for place kick PAT, 2 points for defensive conversion following TD, 2 points for safety. 3 points for a field goal, 4 points for a drop kick field goal. Backfield in Motion ‚Äì One player may be in motion in any direction behind the line of scrimmage prior to the snap. Offensive Linemen ‚Äì Three linemen must be in a three- or four-point stance prior to the snap. They must line up guard, center, guard and next to one another. Any offensive lineman not covered up by the fourth man on the line of scrimmage is an eligible receiver if he is wearing an eligible receiver number (1-49, 80-89). Defensive Linemen ‚Äì There must be three defensive linemen, and they must line up on the nose, or can line up inside foot-to-outside foot outside of an offensive lineman Linemen must rush inside if nose up or slanted into if shaded, and they must make contact before any movement to the outside is made. Blitzing ‚Äì Only one non- lineman can blitz at a time. This player can blitz from any direction, but must be at least five yards off the line of scrimmage/goal line prior to the snap. Players do not have to announce their eligibility to blitz. Linebackers ‚Äì At least two defensive players must line up at least 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. The other two non-linemen must either line up face-to-face with an offensive non-lineman on the line, or be five yards behind the line of scrimmage. After the snap, this rule is eliminated and the players can roam anywhere they wish, provided it does not violate blitzing rules. Linebackers can line up at the goal line if the offense is within five yards of scoring. Kickoffs ‚Äì If a kickoff leaves the field of play on the fly, the ball comes out to the 25-yard line. The sideline walls and end zone walls are not out of bounds, and balls can be played off of them. If a kickoff leaves the field of play after making contact with the field or a player on either team, the ball comes out to the 5-yard line, or the point in which it leaves the field of play, whichever is closest to the kicking team's goal line. Offense ‚Äì No punting. Offense must attempt to gain a first down or touchdown, or may attempt a field goal (by placement or drop kick). Coaches ‚Äì One coach from each team is allowed on the field during game time, but must stay a required distance from the dasher boards. Overtime ‚Äì Overtime is played with NCAA-style rules (each team gets one possession), but each possession is started with a kickoff rather than at the 25-yard line. Teams must go for a two-point conversion (by scrimmage play) starting with the third overtime session. The most notable rule difference in the CIFL from other indoor football leagues is that the CIFL plays seven players to a side, as opposed to most indoor leagues, which play eight men to a side. The league does not utilize a rebound net, but otherwise, its rules are nearly identical to those of the Arena Football League. United Indoor Football The field is the same width (85 feet) as a standard NHL hockey rink. The field is 50 yards long with up to an 8-yard end zone. (End zones may be a lesser depth with League approval.) Depending on the stadium in which a game is being played, the end zones may be rectangular (like a basketball court) or curved (like a hockey rink). There is a heavily padded wall on each sideline, with the padding placed on top of the hockey dasher boards. The field goal uprights are 9 feet wide, and the crossbar is 18 feet above the playing surface. Unlike Arena football, the ball is not \\"live\\" when rebounded off the nets behind the end zone, or their support apparatuses. A player is counted as out of bounds on the sidelines if they come into contact or fall over the boundary wall. Each team fields eight players at a time from a 21-man active roster. Substitution rules A substitute may enter the field of play any time the ball is dead. However, a substitute must remain on the field for at least one play. Substitutions are not permitted by rule in any way that shall deceive an opponent. A team that breaks a huddle with more than eight players commits an illegal substitution infraction, for which a 5-yard penalty is immediately assessed. A team that begins a play from scrimmage with more than eight players commits an illegal participation infraction, for which a 10-yard penalty is immediately assessed. Formations The Offensive Box is defined as the area bordered by the outside shoulders of the two Offensive guards, the line of scrimmage, and the distance of five yards behind the line of scrimmage on the offensive side of the ball. Four offensive players must be on the line of scrimmage at the snap, with no more than three of said players in the Offensive Box. The Offensive guards and center must wear numbers that denote they are ineligible to carry the ball nor may they release downfield on pass plays. All players outside the Offensive Box must be at least two yards outside the shoulders of an Offensive guard, and no closer than one yard to another player. No more than two backs (including the Quarterback) may be in the Offensive Box at the snap. Up to two players may be in motion on the offense prior to the snap. Any man in motion must begin in the box. One offensive player may be moving forward at the time of the snap, but all players in motion must be outside the Offensive Box at the snap. There are special rules that prevent a man in motion from blocking defenders below the waistline. A man in motion is also prevented from blocking defensive linemen or the blitzing linebacker. The Defensive Box is defined as the area bordered by the outside shoulders of the two Offensive guards, the line of scrimmage, and the distance of five yards beyond the line of scrimmage on the defensive side of the ball. Three defensive players must be in a three- or four-point stance at the start of the snap. One defender serving as a linebacker outside the Defensive Box may raise their hand prior to the snap to signify their intent to rush. Defenders that begin in the Defensive Box must make contact with one of the Offensive linemen before they are allowed to drop back into pass coverage. Defenders that begin outside the Defensive Box may approach the line of scrimmage to align themselves with an offensive player granted they do so at least two yards outside the shoulders of the Offensive guard. Ball movement The ball is kicked off from the goal line. The team with the ball is given four downs to gain ten yards or score. Punting is illegal because of the size of the playing field. A receiver jumping to catch a pass needs to get only one foot down in bounds for the catch to be deemed a completed catch. Balls that bounce off the padded walls that surround the field are live. The defending team may return missed field goal attempts that fall short of the end zone. If a free kick strikes the ceiling or any object hanging from said ceiling, while over the field of play, it is immediately dead, and it belongs to the receiving team 5 yards from mid-field. Scoring The scoring is the same as in the NFL with the addition of a drop kick field goal worth four points during normal play or two points as a post-touchdown conversion. Blocked extra points and turnovers on two-point conversion attempts may be returned by the defensive team for two points. A rouge-kickoff downed in the end zone is worth 1 point to the kicking team; a rogue-kickoff is when the kick returner is caught in his own end zone. A free kick recovered in the end zone by the kicking team is considered a touchdown. Timing A game consists of four 15-minute quarters with a 20-minute halftime intermission. The clock typically only stops for time-outs, penalties, injuries, and official clarifications. Further stoppages occur for incomplete passes and out of bounds during the final 90 seconds of the halves. A mandatory official's time-out, called a promotional timeout, is assessed after the first and fourth quarters and is 90 seconds in duration. Another mandatory official's time-out, called a warning period, is assessed with 90 seconds to play at the end of each half. The game may also be stopped for further promotional time-outs, but must not exceed 90 seconds per league rules. Overtime rules Each team will get a possession from the 25-yard line to try and score. If one team out scores the other on the possession, the game is over. If still tied after an Overtime possession, the procedure is repeated until whoever is up, which wins the game. World Indoor Football League The proposed World Indoor Football League of 1988 proposed that eight players play on offense and seven players play on defense. It was otherwise similar to other indoor football leagues. Street football The teams organize each other at the beginning of the game; if there are no pre- selected teams, a draft is held on the spot from the available players. In the event of an odd number of players, one player will usually serve as an \\"all time quarterback,\\" who plays on offense the whole game and cannot run the ball past the line of scrimmage, or, if more players are on their way, the team who is short handed will automatically draft the newcomer upon arrival. The two teams organize on opposite sides of the field for the kickoff. Because of skill, field size and other issues, this is usually not a kickoff but rather a punt-off or a throw-off. Many versions skip this process and start the offense at a certain point, similar to a touchback in NFL or other national leagues. As in regular American football, each team usually has four downs per series. In order to achieve a series of downs, backyard football requires the team with the ball to complete two passes or reach a certain point on the field. Few games include enough people to run a chain crew to maintain the 10 yard familiar in most organized leagues. These structures encourages passing plays over running, as does the usual lack of offensive and defensive lines. Play continues until there is a turnover on downs (i.e. the offensive team fails to complete two passes in four downs), an interception occurs, or the team on offense scores a touchdown. Touchdowns are worth 6, 7, or 1 point(s) depending on the rules set out before the game. Field goals and extra point kicks are nonexistent (streets and backyards have no goal posts), although punts can frequently happen, usually during \\"4th and 2 completions\\" situations where the offensive team cannot earn a first down. (In games played on regulation fields, these kicks can be attempted, but only in certain scoring systems.) In the event a touchdown is scored, the team on offense will normally stay in the end zone in which they had just scored and the other team will go into the main field and field the subsequent kickoff. Thus, until an interception or turnover on downs, both teams defend and attempt to score on the same end zone. Rules greatly vary from neighborhood to neighborhood, and are customarily set before each game. There can be a rush on the QB depending on the rules set out before the game. Usually if rushes are allowed, there are 2 rules that are commonly applied; Call rush and blitz count. Call rush is the first rule of rushing the QB in street. This is where the defense calls \\"Blitz\\" in a loud voice before the offense hikes the ball, signifying that they will rush, but there is also a counter effect with this. The QB can get out of the pocket and run without having to pass or hand off the ball, also the quarterback can call \\"shotgun\\" before or after the other team says \\"blitz\\" causing the opposite to have to count to 5 or 10 depending on whether or not they called blitz 5 calling \\"shotgun\\" adds 5 seconds to the blitz count. The second, and more common, rush QB rule is Mississippi rush (a blitz count), so called because the blitzing player must insert the word \\"Mississippi\\" between numbers so as not to allow the player to count ridiculously fast and effectively give the quarterback no time to throw. Sometimes the two rules are combined, allowing one separate call of \\"Blitz!\\" per set of 4 downs. The other option to handle a rush is to use an offensive lineman or center to block any pass rush. A line is rare in street, and the act of a center snapping to a quarterback is completely optional. Most teams that use a line opt for 3 down linemen(1 center and 2 guards). Some organizations that don't require the center to snap the ball to the quarterback only use 2 linemen. Conversions after a TD usually aren't applied and they can only be attempted from the 6 (or occasionally 7) point TD system, but if they are, there are several conversion systems, including \\"single point,\\" \\"pass-run,\\" yardage and \\"runback.\\" The single-point is the simplest of the rules, in which any successful conversion is worth one point. Pass run is used in some midget leagues and awards 2 points for a pass and one point for a run. Usually all pass-run conversions are attempted from the 1 or 2-yard line. The second conversion system is the yardage system, similar to that used in the XFL playoffs and the proposed New USFL. The yardage system is formatted like this: 1 point conversions are attempted from the 1 or 5-yard line, and 2-point conversions are attempted from the 2 or 10-yard line. The runback is the most rare of the conversion rules, and is most often implemented in one-on-one games. In this version, the play does not end once the ball crosses the goal line; instead, the player with the ball must change direction and advance it all the way back to the other end zone for two points. The game ends when a pre-determined number of touchdowns or points has been scored, or an arbitrary time is reached (for instance, dusk or the start of school). Penalties are rare and are usually only enforced in the most egregious cases, such as serious injuries. Touch football Depending on the skill of the players, the available playing field, and the purpose of the game, the rules other than the tackling aspect may remain mostly the same or vary considerably from traditional American football. Touch football can be played by teams as few as two or as many as eleven on each side; usually, games consist of teams of four to seven. Positions in touch football are far less formal than its more organized counterpart. While some games roughly follow conventions, more often, all players will be considered eligible receivers (as in six-man football), and there are usually no running backs. There may or may not be a snapper; if there is not, the quarterback initiates play by hovering the ball above the line of scrimmage and pulling it backward to simulate a snap. Generally, in touch football, nearly every play is a passing play, whereas run plays and pass plays tend to be well balanced in organized football. Some games will also implement a \\"blitz count\\", or a period of time that must elapse after the snap before the defense may cross the line of scrimmage in order to attempt to tackle the quarterback. The count thus gives the quarterback time to complete a pass in the absence of effective blocking (when teams are small, there is often no blocking at all). Other games will not use a count and thus blocking becomes important. Conversely, in the presence of a \\"blitz count\\" there is also often a \\"QB sneak\\" rule, which prevents the quarterback from taking unfair advantage of the blitz count by preventing the quarterback from crossing the line of scrimmage before the blitz count is finished. Because of these rules, passing plays are far more common than running plays in touch football. Along with the size of the teams, the size of the field can vary considerably. In a park, or spring practice situation, a full-sized field may be available, but many games are played in the front and back yards of suburban and rural village neighborhoods, where the whole field may not be much more than ten to thirty yards long. In most of these situations, there are no yard lines, requiring some change in the definition of a first down. Instead of requiring that a team advance the ball ten yards, sometimes two pass completions result in a first down. Another option is to eliminate first downs entirely, so that a team gets four (sometimes five) chances to score. When it is desired for an odd number of players to play, it is common to allow one player to be an \\"all-time Quarterback\\" player; this player will always be on the offense or the kicking team, switching sides throughout the game. When this occurs, there is usually no blitz count and the all-time quarterback is usually never allowed to cross the line of scrimmage. Another common variation is the elimination of the field goal and extra point kick; this is usually due to the absence of goal posts and tees on the field as well as due to poor kicking skill by the participants. Some games eliminate kicking altogether, directing the teams to start each possession after a touchdown at the twenty-yard line, as if a kickoff and touchback had just occurred; other players prefer to change the kickoff into a \\"throw-off\\" or a \\"punt-off.\\" Scoring and game timing are much different in touch football than its more organized counterpart. For the sake of simplicity, touchdowns are usually worth 1 point and no other scoring is counted (there are no extra point attempts). In a much lesser used variation, a touchdown is worth 6 points and if the player who scored the touchdown can progress in the other direction from the end zone in which he had just scored back to the opposite end zone without being touched, it counts as a two-point conversion. The former scoring method does not allow for other scoring types such as safeties. There is usually no game clock and the game ends when one opponent has reached 10 touchdowns (in the former convention) or 100 points (in a standard convention). * Touch football is generally played by amateurs, often teenagers or children. * In Mexico the \\"touch football\\" is also known with the nickname of \\"tochito\\", nickname from the name of the game. * During Thanksgiving, many Americans are known to play in \\"Turkey Bowls,\\" games of touch or tackle football (without football pads) between family and friends. * During offseason spring workouts, many high school and college teams play touch football to work on passing formations and plays. Professional football (American) American Football League The NFL adopted many ideas introduced by the AFL, including names on player jerseys and revenue sharing of gate and television receipts. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a stopwatch used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it; it has been 16-game seasons since 1978. The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's pro football more like the AFL than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States. NFL Europa The NFL has traditionally used a sudden death format for overtime. Regular-season games have a single period of overtime during which the first team to score wins the game. If neither team scores, the game is declared a tie. In post- season games, overtime is extended indefinitely until one team scores. In NFL Europa, however, the overtime period lasted for 10 minutes with the requirement that each team must have the opportunity of possession at least once. So, in NFL Europa, it was possible for one team to score in overtime, then have to kick off to the opponent and give them a chance to either equalize or win the game. The winner was the team with the highest score after both teams had had possession. If the score was even after the second team's possession, the overtime would continue as sudden death. If still tied after 10 minutes, the game ends as a tie. Only two games ever remained tied after overtime in WLAF/NFL Europa history: London Monarchs versus Birmingham Fire in Week 4 of the 1992 season, and Berlin Thunder at Hamburg Sea Devils, on April 1, 2006. The score of both games was 17‚Äì17.Europass: Unusual tie is Thunder's gain NFL.com. Accessed 29 June 2007. With association football being the traditionally popular sport in Europe and American football being a relative newcomer, the rules were changed slightly to encourage a greater element of kicking, which was intended to make the game more enjoyable for football and rugby fans. The league did this by awarding 4 points to field goals of more than 50 yards, as opposed to 3 points in the NFL. This had the interesting side-effect that a touchdown and PAT lead (7 points) could be equaled by one regular field goal (3 points) as well as a long field goal (4 points). This concept would later be adopted by the proposed New United States Football League, with the distance required for the fourth point increased from 50 to 55 yards. Also, there was a requirement that at least one player of Non- American extraction, referred to as \\"national\\" players, participate in every down for both teams as of the 2006 season (in previous seasons one was required to play only on every down of every other series). In addition to European players a number of Mexican and Japanese players played as national players. Up until the 2004 season, kicked conversion attempts and short field goals were attempted by national players. Since there are few European players who have had the chance to compete at a level comparable to U.S. college football and the NFL, many, if not most, of the European players ended up as kickers. Among the notable national players were Scott McCready, an English wide receiver who played some preseason games for the New England Patriots, the Claymores' wide receiver Scott Couper, who played a pre-season game for the Chicago Bears, Constantin Ritzmann, a German defensive end who had played for the University of Tennessee, and Rob Hart, an English rugby player who became a placekicker; he kicked barefoot. United Football League Like previous football leagues, the UFL has instituted several mostly minor rules changes that will differ from the NFL's rules. Though the league has indicated it would mostly adhere to standard rules, there are a few differences, as follows: *No Tuck Rule - The Tuck rule is one of the most controversial rules in the NFL. In the NFL, if a passer brings his arm forward in a passing motion and then loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body, it's considered a forward pass (and thus an incomplete pass if the ball hits the ground). In the UFL, it would be called a fumble. *Touchdown celebrations - Celebrations, individual or group, will only take place in the endzones and on the bench area. *Fumbling out of the endzones- If the ball is fumbled out of the endzone, it will be placed back at the spot of the fumble, pending which team last had possession. *Intentional grounding - A quarterback is allowed to intentionally ground the ball anywhere behind the line of scrimmage if he is under pressure. *Instant replay - All reviews will be viewed upstairs by the replay official and he will only have 90 seconds for review. *Overtime - Both teams will be guaranteed at least one possession. When a team scores, the other team will get a last chance to score on the next drive. *Standardized uniforms - Unlike most other leagues, the UFL's four inaugural teams have uniforms with identical designs, with the only differences being the colors of the jerseys‚Äîblack for New York, silver for Las Vegas (an homage to the team's home stadium, formerly known as the Silver Bowl), blue for Florida, green for California. The team's logo consists of a two-letter abbreviation indicating its home. As such, the league will not need to use separate \\"home and away\\" dark and light jerseys. United States Football League At first the USFL competed with the older, more established National Football League by following the David Dixon plan and trying not to compete directly with it, primarily by playing its games on a March‚ÄìJune schedule but also having slightly different rules, most notably: * The two- point conversion (since adopted by the NFL, in 1994). * The college rule of stopping the clock after first downs was used only for the final two minutes of each half. New United States Football League Like the XFL, which adopted a number of unusual rules to drive fan curiosity, the USFL has announced the possibility of a number of new rules (many of which were adopted from previous leagues): * No pre-season, just a regular season (adopted from the World Football League, although the WFL played a 20-week regular season) * No touchbacks on kickoffs; if the ball goes out of the endzone, it will be placed at the 15-yard line (adopted from Arena Football League) * Field goals of 51 yards or more will be four points (adopted from NFL Europe) * A three- point conversion will be placed at the 10-yard line (adopted from the XFL) * One foot inbounds for a catch (a rule in virtually every league except the NFL) * No kneel-downs (adopted from Arena Football League, abolished since 2018) * Safeties are worth four points * Overtime will be played like in college and the CFL No word has been announced on whether the league will continue to follow the path of the XFL and adopt other rules like the forward motion rule used by the WFL, XFL and arena leagues, as well as in Canadian football. World Football League The WFL had several important rules differences from the National Football League of that era, and many were eventually adopted by the older league: * Touchdowns were worth 7 points, instead of 6. * Conversions were called \\"Action Points\\" and could only be scored via a run or pass play (as opposed to by kick as in other football leagues), and were worth one point. The ball was placed on the five-yard line for an Action Point. This rule was a revival of a 1968 preseason experiment by the NFL and American Football League. The XFL employed a similar rule 27 years later. * Kickoffs were from the 30-yard line instead of the 40. Before 1974, NFL teams kicked off from the 40; from 1974 to 1993 & since 2011, the NFL moved its kickoffs back to the 35, and from 1994 to 2010, the kickoff line was pushed back to the 30. * Receivers needed only one foot in bounds for a legal pass reception, instead of two feet in the NFL then and now. College and high school football, the Arena Football League, and the CFL have always used the one-foot rule. * Bump-and-run pass coverage was outlawed once a receiver was 3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The NFL later adopted this rule, with a 5-yard bump zone. * The goalposts were placed at the end line (the back of the end zone). At that time, college football goalposts were at the end line, but the NFL had its goalposts at the goal line from 1933 through 1973. Starting with the 1974 season, the NFL also moved its posts back to the end line. * Missed field goals were returned to the line of scrimmage or the 20-yard line, whichever was farther from the goal line. The NFL also adopted this rule for its 1974 season, then replaced the line of scrimmage with the point of the kick in 1994. Before this rule, missed field goals were (if unreturned) touchbacks, with the ball placed at the 20-yard line. U.S. college football later adopted this rule, but left the point as the line of scrimmage rather than the point of the placement. * A player in motion was allowed to move toward the line of scrimmage before the snap, as long as he was behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. This rule had never been used at any level of outdoor American football, but was (and still is) part of Canadian football. This rule is used in the Arena Football League and was used in the XFL. * Punt returners were prohibited from using the fair catch, although the covering team could not come within 5 yards of the kick returner until he caught the ball. This rule also came from Canadian football, which still uses it, as does Arena football with kickoffs and missed field goals. The XFL also used the so- called \\"halo rule\\". * Penalties for offensive holding and ineligible receiver downfield were 10 yards, instead of 15. Several years later, these became 10-yard penalties at all levels of football. Still later, the ineligible receiver penalty was changed to 5 yards (with loss of down). * The WFL's original overtime system was like nothing used in any form of American football before or since; it was more similar to the system long used in international soccer. Overtime in the regular season was one fixed 15-minute period, divided into two halves of 7¬Ω minutes, each starting with a kickoff by one of the teams. The complete overtime was always played; there was no \\"sudden death\\" feature. In 1975, the WFL changed its overtime to the 15-minute sudden-death period, which the NFL adopted in 1974 and still uses today, albeit 5 minutes shorter since 2017. * Limited (or no) pre-season games. In 1974 and 1975, NFL teams played six pre-season games and 14 regular-season games (which was changed in 1978 to the current four pre-season and 16 regular-season games). In contrast, the WFL's 1974 schedule called for 20 regular-season games and no pre-season games; in 1975, it was 18 regular- season games and two pre-season games. * Summertime football. The NFL's regular season started on September 15 in 1974 and on September 21 in 1975; the WFL's regular season started on July 10 in 1974 and on July 26 in 1975 (with the 1975 pre-season starting on July 5). The Canadian Football League, which must contend with colder winters than American leagues, has always played during the summer with a similar schedule. * Weeknight football (1974). While NFL games were played mostly on Sundays and a game on Monday Night, the WFL's 1974 schedule called for Wednesday night football (with a Thursday night national TV game). This scheduling format was abandoned in 1975. The featured Thursday night game was later adopted as \\"Thursday Night Football\\" by the NFL in 2006. * The \\"Dickerod\\". Instead of using a ten-yard chain strung between two sticks for measuring first down yardage, the WFL used a device called the \\"Dickerod,\\" obstensibly named for its inventor. This was a single stick, roughly ten feet tall, mounted on a base which allowed it to pivot from side to side. The stick was swung down to ground level when a first down was being set, and a marker that slid along the shaft was fixed in place to line up with the nearest gridiron line (the major yard lines spaced every five yards). When that was set, the stick was swung back to the upright position. When a measurement was needed by the officials, the Dickerod was brought out to the ball position, the shaft swung down to ground level, the marker lined up with the nearest gridiron line, and the measurement was taken. (In all other forms of football today, a similar marker is clipped to the standard ten-yard chain, also lining up with a gridiron line.) World League of American Football The WLAF played two seasons with 10 teams in the spring of 1991 and 1992, with the World Bowl as championship games. Rules unique to WLAF included assigning increasing point value to field goals based on distance, and a requirement that at least one player of non-US nationality participate in at least every other series of downs. New ideas were successfully tested, like using the two- point conversion rule also on the professional field before adopting it in the NFL in 1994. Other minor tweaks in gameplay, such as a shorter kickoff tee, were also first used in the WLAF. XFL Despite boasts by WWF promoters of a \\"rules-light\\" game and universally negative reviews from the mainstream sports media early on, the XFL played a brand of 11-man outdoor football that was recognizable, aside from the opening game sprint to determine possession and some other changes, some modified during the season. In fact, most of the rule changes were inherited from the 1970s World Football League. Grass stadiums All XFL teams had to play in outdoor stadiums with grass surfaces.List of stadiums courtesy of xflboard.com. No domed stadiums, artificial turf stadiums, or retractable roof stadiums were allowed. (This happened to occur during now-extinct Giants Stadium's brief experiment with natural grass; the stadium's turf did not hold up well in the winter and early spring weather and the stadium reverted to its traditional artificial turf in 2003.) Opening scramble Replacing the coin toss at the beginning of each game was an event in which one player from each team sought to recover a football 20 yards away in order to determine possession. Both players lined up side by side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues). The scramble led to the first XFL injury: Orlando Rage free safety Hassan Shamsid-Deen separated his shoulder in the scramble during the XFL's opening weekend. This injury would keep Shamsid-Deen out for the rest of the season. No PAT (point after touchdown) kicks After touchdowns there were no extra point kicks, due to the XFL's perception that an extra point kick was a \\"guaranteed point.\\" To earn a point after a touchdown, teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL/NCAA/CFL two-point conversion), but for just a single point. By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line. This rule, as originally implemented, was similar to the WFL's \\"Action Point,\\" and was identical to a 1968 experiment by the NFL and American Football League, used only in preseason interleague games that year. Overtime Ties were resolved in similar fashion to the NCAA and present-day CFL game, with at least one possession by each team, starting from the opponent's 20-yard line. There were differences: there were no first downs - teams had to score within four downs, and the team that had possession first in overtime could not attempt a field goal until fourth down. If that team managed to score a touchdown in fewer than four downs, the second team would only have that same number of downs to match or beat the result. If the score was still tied after one overtime period, the team that played second on offense in the first OT would start on offense in the second OT. Bump and run The XFL allowed full bump and run coverage early in the season. Defensive backs were allowed to hit wide receivers any time before the quarterback released the ball, as long as the hit came from the front or the side (similar to the NCAA). In an effort to increase offensive production, bump and run was restricted to the first five yards from the line of scrimmage (similar to NFL) following the fourth week of the season. Forward motion Unlike the NFL, but like the World Football League and Arena football before it, the XFL allowed one offensive player to move toward the line of scrimmage once he was outside the tackles. Halo rule / live punts The heavily hyped \\"no fair catch\\" rule (announcers tended to mention it on almost every punt/kickoff) was paired with a five-yard zone excluding players of the kicking team around potential returners before the ball touched them or the ground, similar to rules in Canadian football, rugby football, and contemporary NCAA rules (where the term \\"halo\\" was applied, though the XFL called it instead the \\"danger zone\\"). But instead of making punt returns more exciting, it often had the opposite effect, since the XFL players' inexperience with the rule caused a high number of game-delaying penalties. The fair catch had previously been abolished from Canadian rules, NCAA rules (but only for the 1950 season), and Rugby league. Another difference was that after touching ground 25 yards or more beyond the line of scrimmage, punts could be recovered and advanced by all players of the kicking team. This led to more quick kicks being taken on third-down-and-long situations in the one season of the small league than had been seen in the NFL over several preceding decades of longer seasons. XFL's \\"innovation\\" was similar to a rule that had been in effect in American football in the 1910s and part of the 1920s. XFL penalized 10 yards from the succeeding spot punts going out of bounds, even if they first touched the ground (but not a player of the receiving team). For the initial weeks of the season, the XFL forbade all players on the kicking team from going downfield before a kick was made from scrimmage on that down, similarly to a rule the NFL considered in 1974. For the rest of the season the XFL modified it to allow one player closest to each sideline downfield ahead of the kick, the same modification the NFL adopted to their change just before their 1974 exhibition games started. The purpose of these provisions was to keep play going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back. Roster and salaries The XFL limited each team to an unusually low 38 players (roughly analogous to the 42 for CFL rosters, as opposed to 53 on NFL teams and 80 or more on unlimited college rosters). This resulted, most commonly, in each team only carrying two quarterbacks and one kicker, who doubled as the punter. The XFL paid standardized player salaries. Quarterbacks earned U.S. $5,000 per week, kickers earned $3,500, and all other uniformed players earned $4,500 per week, though a few players got around these restrictions (Los Angeles Xtreme players Noel Prefontaine, the league's lone punting specialist, and Matt Malloy, a wide receiver) by having themselves listed as backup quarterbacks. Players on a winning team received a bonus of $2,500 for the week, $7,500 for winning a playoff game. The team that won the championship game split $1,000,000 (roughly $25,000 per player). Furthermore, players did not receive any fringe benefits, meaning players had to pay for their own health insurance. Alliance of American Football The Alliance of American Football (AAF), which folded before the end of its inaugural 2019 season, had several significant rule differences from other leagues. Kickoffs The AAF eliminated kickoffs. Possession at the start of each half, or after any offensive score, began on the \\"receiving\\" team's 25-yard line (the same point as the NFL then used after touchbacks on kickoffs), barring the \\"kicking\\" team choosing to attempt an \\"onside conversion\\". After a safety, the scoring team would take possession at its own 35-yard line, again with the caveat that the scored-upon team could attempt an onside conversion. The onside conversion, which replaced the onside kick, was a play unique to the AAF. Following an offensive score, a team could choose to attempt a scrimmage play from its own 28-yard line; if it gained 12 or more yards on that play, it would keep possession, with play resuming from the final spot of the ball. A failed attempt would result in the scored-upon team taking possession at the final spot of the ball. This play could only be attempted if the scoring team was trailing by at least 17 points at any time in the game, or during the last 2 minutes of the first half or last 5 minutes of the game. The onside conversion was also available to the scored-upon team following a safety (with the same restrictions regarding score and/or time remaining), with the spot of the play being that team's own 18-yard line and the required distance to gain being the same 12 yards. Defensive restrictions The defense could not advance more than five players across the line of scrimmage, and no defensive player could cross the line of scrimmage from more than 2 yards outside the offensive tackles. Violations were categorized as \\"illegal defense\\" and resulted in a 15-yard penalty. Conversions The AAF prohibited conversion kicks‚Äîall conversion attempts were required to be regular scrimmage plays (runs or passes), and if successful were scored as two-point conversions. Overtime In regular-season play, only one overtime period was played, using \\"Kansas Playoff\\" rules with the spot of possession being the defensive team's 10-yard line. Each team had four downs to score a touchdown, with a score followed by a two-point conversion attempt. Field goals were prohibited. If the game remained tied after each team had one possession, it ended in a tie. Reports varied on the overtime system the AAF would have used if it had reached the postseason. Women's football National Women's Football Association NWFA teams play according to standard National Football League rules with the following notable exceptions: * TDY-sized football * only one foot in-bounds is required for a reception * no blocking below the waist downfield Legends Football League Play style is full-contact. Uniforms consist of helmets, shoulder pads, elbow pads, knee pads, sports bras, and shorts. There are no kickoffs nor field goals, punts are allowed if inside their own 10-yard line; halves and after scores begin on their own 15-yard line. A team must attempt to get a first down on every fourth down. After a touchdown, a team can attempt a one-point conversion from the one-yard line, or a two-point conversion from the three-yard line. The defending team can run the ball toward their end zone for 2 points off conversion attempts; offending team can get 1 point if safety is scored off conversion attempts. There are seven women on each side of the 50-yard field, one player less than in arena football. Teams consist of 18 players, of which 12 are active on game day. This means at least 3 or 4 players play both ways, as \\"iron women\\". But coaches are allowed free substitution. The standard offensive formation features 1 quarterback, 2 running backs, 1 center, and 3 wide receivers. The standard defensive formation features 2 defensive linewomen, 2 linebackers, 2 cornerbacks, and 1 safety. The field is 50-yard between end zones, 30 yards wide, and the end zones are 8 yards deep. A game consists of four 10-minute periods, separated by a 12-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in championship). In the event of a tie, an 8-minute sudden-death overtime is played; whoever scores first wins it; otherwise, the game ends drawn & teams get a tie (half-victory/half-loss) in standings; however, in postseason, multiple 10-minute overtime periods are played until one team scores, which wins the game. Teams get 2 timeouts per half or overtime period. Targeting players, such as using the helmet to ram opponents, is prohibited; they risk immediate disqualification plus a 15-yard penalty if they do. As in the NFL, injuries in last two minutes of half or overtime result in the team using a timeout; if, however the team has no timeouts, and this occurs, they're granted one.
