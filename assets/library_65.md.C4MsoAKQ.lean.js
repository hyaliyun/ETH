The band have mostly released music on their own Bijin label. The compilation album \\"Neji/Tori\\" was released by Norway's Smalltown Supersound in 2008. The band are known for their dynamic live show, and despite little mainstream media attention, have built a substantial international following. They have played dates in Australia, Austria, Croatia, Denmark (including Roskilde Festival), France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Norway. Switzerland, Sweden, UK and USA. The band toured the USA in 2004 and 2005. In April 2011 they performed on the main stage at Sonar Sound Tokyo. In May 2011, Nisennenmondai launched an extensive European tour. Style Described by allmusic's Heather Phares as \\"taking as much inspiration from the cool kids at school as they did from experimentalists like This Heat, The Pop Group, Sonic Youth, DNA and Neu!\\" Nisennenmondai compose raw and repetitive (post) punk instrumentals, which can be groove- oriented whilst also having a no wave/disco vibe. Himeno tirelessly pounds at her snare and bass drum while slashing her cymbals, while Takada adds layers of delay and clangy sounding distortion. \\"With walls of distortion and a pummeling rhythmic backbone that fluctuates between krautrock\`s repetition and free-rock calamity, bassist Zai, guitarist Ma-Chan and drummer Hime have formed an unassuming juggernaut‚Äù (Dazed & Confused). Prefuse 73 said in an interview with Dazed & Confused; \\"John Stanier from Battles had told me that they were sick. They start to play. Next thing you know, these three tiny diminutive women were making us look like idiots because they were so incredible\\". The band were chosen by Battles to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival, that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England.

Along with partner agencies, the Federation nurtures and educates children, maintains and strengthens family life, brings comfort and care to the elderly and reinforces and sustains the connection to the worldwide Jewish community.  History  The Minneapolis Jewish Federation, or simply Federation as it is familiarly called, was first founded in 1930 in order to coordinate fundraising and social service planning and delivery within the Jewish community. Its first local beneficiary agency was the Talmud Torah, a community Jewish educational supplementary school. The remainder of the funds raised was sent to national or international causes‚Äîhospitals, orphanages, and yeshivas. The organization concentrated on fundraising during its early years, a task made difficult by the Depression. It created the Minnesota Jewish Council in order to combat anti-Semitism in the late 1930s. It attempted to act as the coordinating body for anti Nazi protests during the late 1930s and into the 1940s. As Federation expanded, it added separate support divisions‚Äîin 1946 a Women's Division was announced, and in 1978 the Young Leadership Division began. Locally, the Federation provides a Jewish education to over 2,150 Minneapolis students in grades K-12; 25,000 kosher meals to 120 isolated seniors; programming and outreach to nearly 1,200 Jewish students at the University of Minnesota;http://ujews.com/ individualized support to 220 children with special needs in Jewish community schools; and case management and social services to 500 Jewish Seniors. Overseas, Federation supports to more than 100 disabled adults in Israel, allowing them to live independently; basic needs including housing, nutrition and medication to more than 13,000 Israeli seniors; life-saving food packages, medicine and winter relief to 26,000 children in the Former Soviet Union (FSU); education assistance to over 1,000 Ethiopian-Israeli children in pre-school to 6th grade, helping them integrate into Israeli society; and 10,000 children the chance to strengthen their Jewish identity through Jewish summer camps and youth groups in the FSU.  Super Sunday  The Super Sunday phone-a-thon is an annual fundraising event held by many of the 155 Jewish federations located in North America. The phone-a-thons are typically expected to raise most of the budget for the federation and its constituent agencies and organizations. The name \\"Super Sunday\\" is borrowed from the American football usage for the day on which the Super Bowl is played. Impliedly, the Super Sunday phone-a-thon is also the major annual event for the federation, as Super Sundays play a large role in the life of the local Jewish community. The results of a Super Sunday can have a major impact on the contribution intake of any particular federation, and thus can have a domino effect on the various entities that receive federation funding, such as social service organization, classes, scholarships, and family care. Some of the largest and most visible Super Sundays occur in the major urban areas with large Jewish concentrations, such as Los Angeles and New York, but also through small federations, such as Seattle and Minneapolis. Super Sunday was created by Jerry Dick of the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington in 1980.

International manufacturing and development locations include the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, India, China and Brazil. History The company was founded under the name Gilbert & Barker in 1870 by Charles Gilbert and John Barker. The company was renamed as Gilbarco in 1929. For nearly one hundred years Gilbarco was an affiliate of what is today the Exxon Mobil Corporation until it was later acquired by the British engineering company GEC in 1987. Among Gilbarco's first products was a simple oil burning lamp, which was given away in China and other places to increase the purchase of lamp oil. That lamp was so popular within the Exxon culture that it was the inspiration for the name of Exxon's in house magazine \\"The Lamp\\" until that publication was discontinued in recent years. In 1999 GEC renamed itself to Marconi and Gilbarco became Marconi Commerce Systems. In 2002 Gilbarco was acquired by the Danaher Corporation, parent company of Veeder-Root and Red Jacket companies, and became Gilbarco Veeder-Root. In 1984 Gilbarco launched one of America's first and, at the time, most successful instances of lean manufacturing which was called CRISP, an acronym for Continuous Rapid Improvement System of Production. As a result, in 1994 Gilbarco's United States manufacturing plant in Greensboro North Carolina was designated by Industry Week Magazine as One of America's Ten Best Plants. After Gilbarco was acquired by Danaher, the Gilbarco CRISP system was extended and adopted company wide and ultimately evolved into what is today known as the Danaher Production System. In 2002, the Gilbarco and Veeder-Root companies combined into one marketing brand.

Background Elkins was born in Houston, Texas, but her father was an itinerant carpenter and the family moved frequently, living mostly in the southwest and Southern California. After graduating from Orange High School in 1966 she worked her way through college getting her B.A. in art in 1972 and a secondary teaching credential in 1974 from California State University, Hayward, and a M.L.S. in 1979 from San Jose State University. She married Aaron Elkins December 29, 1972. Before becoming a full-time writer, she was a self-employed artist, secondary school teacher, and the librarian of American art at the M.H. de Young Museum in San Francisco, CA in 1980/81. Writing career Elkins started her career in 1981 writing five mass-market romance novels for Mills & Boon/Harlequin under the pseudonym Emily Spenser, which were translated and sold in over a dozen countries. But she had always wanted to collaborate on a mystery with her husband, an established mystery writer. At first she had difficulty creating a character they would both find engaging. The inspiration came by chance. They were living near an American Air Force base in Germany while Aaron was teaching in the University of Maryland's overseas program for the American military, when they had an opportunity to take golfing lessons on the base. Charlotte, who loved the golf-themed stories by P.G. Wodehouse, suddenly realized a novice pro golfer would make an interesting protagonist in an amateur detective novel and Lee Ofsted was born. A Wicked Slice was published in 1989, Publishers Weekly called it an \\"engagingly humorous thriller.\\" Encouraged, over the years the Elkins wrote four more Lee Ofsteds: Rotten Lies (1995), Nasty Breaks (1997), Where have all the Birdies Gone? (2004), and On the Fringe (2005). In between they wrote short stories, one of which, \\"Nice Gorilla,\\" won the Agatha Award for best short story of the year in 1992. In 1996, they co-authored the \\"Cumberland Cup Mystery Game,\\" the first plot for Time Warner Electronic Publishing's Modus Operandi.

Nicholas Lockyer, engraving by Wenceslas Hollar. Life He was son of William Lockyer of Glastonbury, Somerset. On 4 November 1631 he matriculated at Oxford at New Inn Hall, graduated B.A. on 14 May 1633, was incorporated at Cambridge in 1635, and proceeded M.A. from Emmanuel College in 1636. Upon the outbreak of the First English Civil War he took the covenant and engagement, and became known as a fervid, powerful preacher. He was frequently called upon to deliver the fast sermon before the House of Commons. Cromwell made him his chaplain, appointed him fellow of Eton College on 21 January 1650, and in November 1651 sent him to Scotland as preacher with the parliamentary commissioners. In December 1653 Lockyer, being then a preacher at Whitehall, was appointed member of a projected commission for the ejecting and settling of ministers; that scheme having failed, he was appointed a commissioner for the approbation of public preachers. As M.A. of twelve years' standing he was created B.D. at Oxford on 5 June 1654 and became Provost of Eton on 14 January 1659; he was ejected at the Restoration. He was also preacher at St. Pancras, Soper Lane, and rector of St. Benet Sherehog, London, but was deprived in 1662. His persistent disregard of the Uniformity Act 1662 compelled him to retire for a time to Rotterdam in September 1666. In 1670 he had again to leave the country for publishing anonymously a tract entitled Some Seasonable Queries upon the late Act against Conventicles. To the last he persisted in exercising his ministry. He ultimately settled at Woodford, Essex where he died on 13 March 1685, and was buried at St. Mary, Whitechapel. He left a son, Cornelius, and five daughters. He had accumulated property. On 30 June 1653 the council of state resolved to settle lands of inheritance to the value of ¬£200 a year on him and his heirs forever out of deans' and chapters' lands, and an ordinance was passed to that effect on 3 February 1651. He bargained to have the value in money at ten years' purchase, and accordingly received ¬£2,100, with which he purchased the manors of Hambleton and Blackwell, Worcestershire, by indenture dated 27 September 1654. Besides his Worcestershire estates he possessed property at Woodford and Barking, and in Ireland in Munster, which he purchased by virtue of an act made for speedily reducing the rebels of Ireland. Works Lockyer published three of his more important works in small quarto, with a general title-page dated 1643. They are: *'Christ's Communion with his Church Militant,\\" 1644 (4th edit., Cambridge, 1645 ; another edit. London, 1650). * 'A Divine Discovery of Sincerity, according to its proper and peculiar Nature,' 1643 (first printed in 1643, and again in 1649). * 'Baulme for Bleeding England and Ireland, or seasonable Instructions for persecuted Christians, delivered in severall Sermons,' 1644 (originally printed in 1643, and known also by its running title, 'Useful Instructions for these evill Times'). In 1651 Lockyer preached at Edinburgh a discourse on a visible church, which he afterwards published with the title 'A little Stone out of the Mountain: Church Order briefly opened,' Leith, 1652. It gave great offence to Scottish presbyterians, and was refuted at length by James Wood, professor of theology at St. Andrews, in a pamphlet called 'A little Stone, pretended to be out of the Mountain, tried and found to be a Counterfeit,' Edinburgh, 1654. Lockyer's other writings are: * 'England faithfully watcht with in her Wounds, or Christ as a Father sitting up with his Children in their Swooning State, the summe of severall Lectures painfully preached upon Colossians i.,' London, 1646. * 'An Olive Leaf, or a Bud of the Spring, viz. Christ's Resurrection and its end', London, 1650. * 'A Memorial of God's Judgments. Spiritual and Temporal, or Sermons to call to Remembrance,' London, 1671. * 'Spiritual Inspection, or a Review of the Heart.' * 'The Young Man's Call and Duty.' He also published two fast sermons delivered before the House of Commons in 1646 and 1659.

It helps in learning the grammar of foreign languages. Pedagogical grammars typically require rules that are definite, coherent, non-technical, cumulative and heuristic.Odlin, T., (ed.)

Tatars and Russians  The city's population is mainly composed of Russians (about 48.6 percent) and Tatars (about 47.6 percent).  Other communities   Native Middle-Volgans  All Religions Temple. A building and cultural center built by the local artist Ildar Khanov. The city's third ethnos is Chuvash (1.2%), who speak their own language. Chuvash is a Turkic language, which makes it a sister language to Tatar, but it is the most distinct among all the Turkic languages. The Chuvash are Russian Orthodox with some pre-Christian elements in their religion. Other nations native to the Middle Volga are the Maris (0.3%), Udmurts (0.1%), Mordvas (0.2%) and Bashkirs (0.2%). Some of them speak Tatar, some Russian and others their own languages. Bashkirs are normally Muslims. Others, like the Chuvash, are traditionally Orthodox Christian with some pre-Christian elements in their religion. Some Mari come to Kazan for seasonal work, mostly woodwork and carpentry. They build summer houses and saunas for local people. Chuvash and Mari come to the city every day from their republics and sell potatoes and mushrooms at bazaars.  Ethnic Germans  Ethnic Germans came to Kazan from the 18th century. They served in the Russian Army, or worked in Kazan State University. Some of them are very famous in Kazan, particularly professor Karl Fuchs. During World War II, most of them were repressed and deported/ethnic-cleansed by Joseph Stalin's government. Today, the remaining Germans of Kazan mostly speak Russian.  Other groups   Assurs (Assyrians)  A community of Assurs also live in Kazan. By tradition, they work at shoe repairing. Their community lives a closely guarded life, and they do not traditionally mix with other communities.  Jews of Kazan  Since Kazan was not part of the Pale of Settlement, the Jewish community formed relatively late. In 1861, the Jewish population was 184 and mostly consisted of veterans of the Czar's army. By 1897, the population had increased to 1,467 and it continued to grow during World War I as a number of refugees and Jews from Lithuania came to the city. In the 1926, there were 4,156 Jews living in Kazan, making up 2.3% of the population. In the Soviet era, Jewish life was repressed, although the restrictions on Jews and their religious observance were more relaxed in Kazan than other larger cities in the Soviet Union. Jews from Ukraine and other areas in Russia went to Kazan for university because the anti-Jewish quota was more relaxed. In 1970, the Jewish population was 8,000. About 4,000 Jews from Kazan left for the United States and Israel under Gorbachev. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the community reorganized and now has a number communal organizations. Today, Jews number in the tens of thousands.  Immigrants in the Soviet period  During World War II a lot of the populations of what would become, after annexation during the war, the Western Soviet Union were deported to Kazan, including schools, educational institutes, and plants. Some of that population did not return to their native lands. They are: Jews, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Poles, and others (nearly 2.5% of population). They speak Russian, sometimes with Ukrainian accent, and many Jews also speak Tatar.  Immigrants in the 1990s  One of the biggest minorities of Kazan is the Azeri community. Other Caucasians come from Dagestan, Georgia, Armenia and others. They often own caf√©s or work in construction. Another big community is the Central Asian community, which includes Uzbeks, Tajiks, Roma (Lyuli branch) and Kyrgyz. Some of the Uzbeks and Tajiks own caf√©s or fast- food restaurants; they sell dried apricots, popular among Kazan citizens.

Her murder led to one of the longest proven cases of a miscarriage of justice in English legal history. The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and was the subject of a three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was not revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that he could not have committed and others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment.Paragraph 2 After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could not have come from him.Paragraph 6 As a result of Hodgson's appeal, Operation Iceberg was created by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) with the aim of using DNA evidence in pre-1990 rape or murder cases. This led to the review of 240 other convictions. The CCRC also requested that the Crown Prosecution Service identify and review similar murder cases from the time before DNA testing was available. In September 2009, on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body, police named David Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 at the time of the murder, had confessed to police in 1983 that he had raped and killed De Simone, but officers refused to believe him. Lace committed suicide in December 1988. On 27 October 2012, three years after his release, Sean Hodgson died from emphysema. Murder On the evening of 4 December 1979, 22-year-old Teresa De Simone had been working as a part-time barmaid in the Tom Tackle public house (now called The Mayflower Village public house) in Commercial Road, Southampton.Paragraph 7 By day she was employed as a full-time clerk for the Southern Gas Board. She had been employed at the pub for less than a month, working two evenings each week, partly to widen her social circle and partly to supplement her income to pay for the Ford Escort car that she had bought three months previously. The pub was located centrally in the city, only 50 yards (46 metres) from the police station and law courts, and near the city's central train station and the Gaumont Theatre (now The Mayflower). When her shift at the Tom Tackle ended at 23:00 (11:00 p.m.) she went on to a night club in nearby London Road, in the company of her friend Jenni Savage. Although the discoth√®que was a relatively short distance from the public house, they travelled in Savage's car, leaving De Simone's Ford Escort in the pub car park. While at the discoth√®que, De Simone and Savage were together throughout the evening, and De Simone did not consume any alcoholic drinks. They left the night club together, and Savage drove De Simone back to the Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00 a.m.) on 5 December. Savage testified that she drove into the covered parking area and that they sat chatting for a while before De Simone made the short walk to her car, at which point Savage reversed out and drove away from the scene. Savage was the last witness to see De Simone before she was killed. When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, discovered she had not returned home by the morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed De Simone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing De Simone had deliberately left the car overnight he decided to try to move it to allow the delivery through.Paragraph 9 Inside he discovered De Simone's partially clothed body on the back seat. He immediately called the police. Police investigation Forensic investigation The pathologist arrived at the scene at 11:45. His report of the crime scene described \\"the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting against the back of the seat, and the left thigh running along the edge of the seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well.\\" The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00 a.m.) 5 December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: \\"It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as we found the nearside [passenger] door unlocked.\\" The pathologist determined, based on the presence of \\"white frothy mucous\\" in the victim's mouth,Paragraph 10 that the cause of death was a \\"long, slow strangulation\\". Visible on De Simone's neck were \\"a series of multiple, roughly horizontal, linear, bruised abrasions on the front of the neck [which] matched the description of a [gold chain and crucifix] which the deceased had been said to be wearing that evening\\", indicating the possibility that this was used as the ligature and leading to the tabloid press dubbing the murderer the \\"Crucifix Killer\\". The chain was not present when the body was discovered and has never been recovered.Paragraph 11 Semen was present in the vaginal canal, \\"in sufficient concentration to indicate that it had been present no more than three to four hours before death.\\" As De Simone's movements for the entire evening previous to her death were known and documented, the semen could only have come from her assailant. Evidence of bruising and tearing of the genitalia demonstrated that the intercourse was non-consensual. A number of vaginal, anal, oral and control swabs were taken by the pathologist, and subsequent forensic examination demonstrated that the semen was produced by a male with the blood type \\"A\\" or \\"AB\\". Further swabs were taken from De Simone's clothing and the car. The victim's leather handbag and personal belongings, including a diary, were found in multiple locations within the vicinity of the crime scene, although her car keys, Rotary wristwatch, two necklaces, three rings and a bracelet have never been recovered. Suspects The investigation was headed by Detective Superintendent John Porter of Southampton Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D.) In the 12 months after the murder, police \\"interviewed 30,000 people, took 2,500 statements and traced 500 people who were in the area on the night of the murder. At one point the list of possible suspects totalled 300 men.\\" Despite De Simone's possessions being taken, police did not believe that robbery had been the motive; they were convinced that this was a red herring and that she was the victim of a \\"vicious rape by a brutal and merciless killer\\". Police received two anonymous letters, postmarked 12 and 27 December in Southampton which gave information regarding the location of the killer. The writer was never identified, and the eventual arrest of Hodgson led police to dismiss them as a hoax at the time of Hodgson's trial. Nine months after the murder, while Hodgson was already in custody for an unrelated offence,Paragraph 15 two anonymous telephone calls were made to the police in which the caller confessed to killing De Simone. Porter released a statement to the Southern Daily Echo at the time in which he said: \\"The calls came from a man who said that he had committed the murder. He gave the impression that he was under severe strain and was asking for help and advice. From the nature of his conversation we think there is a possibility that the calls could be genuine.\\" Arrest of Sean Hodgson Sean Hodgson (also known as Robert Graham Hodgson, originally from Tow Law, County Durham) first came to the attention of the police on 6 December 1979 when he was arrested in Southampton for an unrelated offence of theft from a vehicle,Paragraph 13 having arrived in the city two days previously. On 7 December he gave a statement to the police implicating another individual in the murder of De Simone, but police were able to eliminate this suspect from their enquiries as he was of blood type \\"O\\".Paragraph 14 On 9 December Hodgson was charged in relation to the theft and remanded in custody. He was interviewed by detectives on several occasions about De Simone's murder; however, as his whereabouts at the time of the murder could not be verified, and police knew he was of blood type \\"A\\", he was briefly investigated. alt=A black-and-white photo of a white male with black hair, wearing a chequered shirt Hodgson grew up surrounded by a large family, and had been placed in a borstal at age 11. He was, nevertheless, described by one schoolmate as a \\"normal teenager\\", and his arrest shocked his home community. Prior to his arrest On 16 May 1980 he pleaded guilty at Southampton to theft and was granted conditional bail awaiting sentence. He was arrested again in London on 4 June and charged with further offences. On 14 July 1980 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. During this trial he confessed to \\"a large number of relatively minor offences\\", although it was found that he could not have committed all of them and some had actually been perpetrated during the period that he had been in custody. On 11 December 1980 Hodgson asked to see a priest, Father Frank Moran, to whom he confessed that he was having nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed \\"kept coming back to him\\".Paragraph 18 He said that the murder had happened in Southampton the previous year and \\"that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death\\". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day,Paragraph 19 and subsequently wrote a note which stated: \\"After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ... I did the murder, why I don't know. So all I can say is let justice be done\\".Paragraph 20 Over the next two weeks, Hodgson gave more confessions and was also escorted to Southampton where he showed the investigating officers where he had disposed of some of De Simone's property.Paragraph 24 It was not routine to make audio recordings of police interviews at the time, and much of the original police paperwork from the case has not been located . What is known, however, is that the statements taken from Hodgson by the police at that time contained \\"detail [which] could only have been known to the man who was responsible for the crime\\" or the investigating officers.Paragraph 17 Although the murder had received wide media coverage, the police had not revealed all of the significant details.Paragraph 36 At Hodgson's subsequent murder trial these were described as the \\"secret details\\".Paragraph 37 It was never investigated whether any of the officers taking Hodgson's statements had in fact disclosed any of these secret details to him when they interviewed him. On 25 December, Hodgson wrote a further confession, claiming to have killed a man in Covent Garden, London, and on 27 December confessed that he had \\"also murdered a homosexual in a flat in North London at the end of '78 or '79\\". Investigations showed that the confessions were false and neither of the crimes had actually happened.Paragraph 28 Hodgson trial Hodgson was tried for the murder of Teresa De Simone at Winchester Crown Court in 1982. During the course of the 15-day trial, Hodgson chose not to give evidence or submit to cross examination. For the defence, Robin Grey QC, explained to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened. The Crown's case against Hodgson was that he \\"under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep on the back seat. When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto the back seat and brushed against [him]. He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased.\\"Paragraph 8 Hodgson's confessions were a significant part of the case against him. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00 a.m. on 5 February 1982, and their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 14:15 (2:15 p.m.) the same day. The judge, Mr. Justice Sheldon, told Hodgson: \\"It is a verdict with which I entirely agree. I have no doubt whatsoever that you were guilty of this appalling, horrible crime of killing that girl.\\" Appeals Hodgson appealed the conviction, but his pre-trial confessions, his knowledge of the \\"secret details\\" and his refusal to take the stand during the trial led to the application for leave to appeal being refused:Paragraph 39 and Paragraph 40 \\"[I]n 1998 an inquiry was made by solicitors then acting on behalf of the appellant to the Forensic Science Service to discover whether the relevant exhibits associated with the murder were available. Presumably that request would have been made in order to see whether further testing might then be possible. The inquiry failed. The response from the Forensic Science Service, as we are told today, was that none of the exhibits had been retained.\\"Paragraph 41 Hodgson, who was at that time in the prison hospital, became more seriously ill, his solicitor was unable to take further instructions, and the line of inquiry was closed. Hodgson continued to maintain his innocence; convicted murderers sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment in the United Kingdom have their cases reviewed by the Parole Board before the end of the minimum fixed term, averaging 14 years. However, continually professing innocence \\"[is] a good indicator of continuing risk\\", leading them to be ineligible for parole. In March 2008, Hodgson responded to an advertisement in Inside Time, a monthly newspaper for prisoners, placed by Mayfair-based solicitors Julian Young and Co. who specialised in appeals against conviction. The solicitors took on Hodgson's case, and Rag Chand spent four months attempting to track down the swab samples which the FSS claimed had been destroyed at least 10 years previously. As the police claimed that there were no surviving papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: \\"The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong.\\" Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands \\"which they appeared to have forgotten about\\". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30 January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.Paragraph 43 =Acquittal and release= alt=Two hugging men stand in a small crowd facing slightly to the right. The man on the left has his right hand raised to the crowd behind the camera, and wears glasses, a black suit and olive green shirt. The man standing next to him has a black suit, white shirt and pink tie. He has his right arm on the left man's right shoulder and his left arm on his own hip. The case was then referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was informed on 26 February 2009 by the Special Crime Division of the CPS that the Crown would not oppose the appeal. The case then went to the Court of Appeal, where, in light of the new DNA evidence available, Hodgson's conviction was quashed. The judgement, which was delivered by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, on 18 March 2009 concluded: \\"The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions. Perhaps the most important is that we do not know who raped and killed the dead girl. We can but hope for the sake of the appellant and the family of the murdered girl that her killer may yet be identified and brought to justice. But for now all we can do is to quash the conviction. It is accordingly quashed. The appellant will be discharged. There will be no new trial.\\"Paragraph 45 Accompanied by his brother Peter, Hodgson walked out of the Royal Courts of Justice a free and innocent man after 27 years of wrongful imprisonment. Hodgson's barrister at the 1982 trial, Robin Grey QC, was there to shake his hand as he was released. Grey said: \\"As a human being I feel glad that we no longer have capital punishment. As a defence barrister I didn't get him off, and I have bitter feelings of guilt about that.\\" Hodgson may be eligible for up to ¬£1 million in compensation. A fund was opened and an interim compensation payment of ¬£250,000 paid into it after two MPs intervened to cut through administrative \\"red tape\\". The fund is protected by law to shield Hodgson from \\"gold diggers\\". As a result of his imprisonment Hodgson suffers from schizophrenia and depression and, whilst imprisoned, his identity was stolen making it difficult to access insurance and housing. =December 2010 arrest= In December 2010 Hodgson was returned to prison awaiting trial over new and unconnected allegations of rape and sexual assault of a 22-year-old woman with learning difficulties at a care home in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in August 2010. On 3 March 2011, Hodgson pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to sexual touching but denied rape. David Crook, prosecuting, said that he would offer no evidence on the rape charge, which was withdrawn. Hodgson's solicitor, Julian Young, said: \\"The wrongful imprisonment for 27 years of my client has had a devastating effect on his life since he was cleared of the murder he did not commit [and he] has been gripped by a number of personal difficulties, including a degree of alcohol abuse.\\" The judge, Mr. Justice Prince, requested the preparation of pre- sentence reports to address the issue of Hodgson's dangerousness, and Hodgson was remanded in custody. On 13 May 2011 he was sentenced to a three-year community order. The judge said that the total of 156 days Hodgson had been remanded in custody prior to sentence would be taken into account, and told Hodgson he \\"could walk free should he agree to complete a psychiatric order imposed by the court, but his barrister Martin Heslop QC, said his client 'clearly bears a great resentment against a criminal justice system which has deprived him of 27 years of liberty'\\" and rejected the option. On 27 October 2012, three years after his release, it was reported that Sean Hodgson had died from emphysema. Operation Iceberg The availability of the new DNA evidence led police to re-open the case, codenamed Operation Iceberg. On 25 March 2009 Detective Chief Inspector Phil McTavish, heading the investigation, announced that the DNA profile had been checked against the United Kingdom National DNA Database but no matches had been found. He said \\"A number of key witnesses have already been located, interviewed and are assisting the investigation. All persons screened to date have been eliminated against the DNA profile. We will screen as many people as we consider necessary.\\" On 11 August 2009 McTavish released a statement that a prime suspect had been identified, adding, \\"While work is ongoing to maximise DNA evidence, the inquiry team is confident they are on the right track and hopefully could be close to solving this 30 year old murder\\". The suspect (later identified as David Lace) was discovered when the profile of the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to De Simone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction. Hodgson's lawyer, Julian Young, said the confessions had been vital information which could have freed his client much earlier, and he was shocked police had not acted on it or passed it on. \\"If it is true these confessions were not followed up by police or passed on to Mr Hodgson's legal team then, or to me as part of the appeal, it is surprising and very disappointing. This may raise serious questions about the way in which the police operated and their failure or unwillingness to disclose evidence. I did not know seven people made admissions. It would have been highly relevant evidence.\\" David Lace David Andrew Lace (born David Andrew Williams on 2 September 1962, Portsmouth) had spent a significant amount of his life in care or boy's homes and hostels and was considered a loner with an aggressive temper. He changed his surname when he was adopted by the Lace family as a child. He received his first criminal conviction in November 1977, aged 15, for burglary. Between 1977 and 1984, he accrued six more convictions and was sentenced to a care order until the age of 18 for robbery in August 1978. In January 1980 he was convicted of two further crimes including theft of property from his lodgings the night before De Simone's murder. He was subsequently convicted of a series of burglaries committed in Portsmouth for which he received an 18-month custodial sentence of which he served 9 months. Following his release he committed robbery again and was sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court to five years and nine months imprisonment, which he served at HMP Dartmoor. Lace was released from Dartmoor in July 1987 and settled in nearby Brixham, Devon, returning to visit family in Portsmouth in 1988. He intimated that he was depressed about his past actions and in December 1988 gave away his possessions and resigned from his job. He was last seen by friends between 7‚Äì8 December and was found dead by his landlord on 9 December. Postmortem examination revealed superficial wounds to his wrist, ingestion of analgesics and a plastic bag over his head. The cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation and his death was determined as suicide by the coroner. Lace was buried in Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth on 20 December 1988. After a cross check on the DNA database found that the DNA from the murder scene showed a partial match with that of a relative of Lace, detectives requested a sample from Andrina Foster, Lace's biological sister, which gave a familial match with the murderer's DNA. As a result of this development, Lace's body was exhumed on 12 August 2009 for DNA testing as part of Operation Iceberg. On 17 September 2009 DCI McTavish confirmed that the comparison of the DNA from the exhumed suspect's body and the DNA evidence from the crime scene presented \\"a complete match\\" and belonged to David Andrew Lace. \\"The evidence overwhelmingly bears out [Lace's] involvement in the rape and murder of Teresa De Simone and we are not seeking anyone else in relation to this matter.\\" The Crown Prosecutor for Hampshire & Isle of Wight stated \\"the evidence would have been sufficient to prosecute David Lace, if he were alive, with the offences of the rape and murder of Teresa De Simone. But this is in no sense a declaration that he was guilty of the offences. Had Mr Lace lived, our decision would merely have authorised the police to begin the legal process by charging him. Only after trial does a jury decide whether a person is guilty or not, on a higher standard of proof ‚Äì beyond reasonable doubt.\\" Lace's confession Lace confessed to the murder on 17 September 1983. He gave a statement to police that he had stolen a rucksack and cash on 4 December 1979 from the care home in Portsmouth where he had been living and then walked to Southampton. He was present at the rear of the Tom Tackle pub when De Simone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached De Simone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10 minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth. Because he had wrongly described significant evidence (including the car and De Simone's clothes), police had dismissed his statement, filing it along with six other confessions to the crime. Hodgson's legal team was never made aware of its existence. Search for jewellery In his confession Lace described how he had disposed of De Simone's jewellery by throwing the items on to the railway embankment beneath Copnor Bridge in Portsmouth. In September 2009 a team of six British Transport Police officers with specialist training in forensic search techniques spent two days examining the area in an attempt to recover the jewellery. Although the ground had been the subject of extensive redevelopment in previous years and recovery of the items was considered unlikely, detectives authorised the operation to ensure every attempt had been made to find and return them to her parents. None of the items were discovered. DCI McTavish said of the search: \\"It is recognised that in the years since Teresa's murder there has been a lot of disturbance and redevelopment around the railway track, but there was still a possibility that items may have lain undisturbed. Although we have not been able to recover any items linked to either Teresa or the suspect it was important we did everything to explore this final aspect of the case.\\" IPCC assessment The case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on 16 September 2009 to determine whether there was evidence of misconduct or negligence by the police during the original murder investigation, the handling of Lace's confession in 1983 and the request from Hodgson's solicitors in 1998 for forensic examination of exhibits. The head of Southampton CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the miscarriage of justice that had taken place and to ensure transparency of inquiries. On 28 October 2009 Mike Franklin, the IPCC commissioner for the south east, announced that as a result of the assessment no further investigation of the police's actions would be undertaken as many of the senior investigating officers were now deceased, and any new investigation \\"would serve no purpose in identifying areas of discipline or learning opportunities due to the passage of time.\\" As a result of the case, however, the IPCC implemented procedural changes to ensure all exhibits relating to a case would now be kept until a convicted person had completed their sentence. Commentary Julian Young, Hodgson's lawyer, also commented that Hodgson did not receive any official support to adjust to life after 27 years. Inmates who serve out a long sentence undergo a long process of re-integration into society. \\"A person released after a conviction is quashed is not entitled to the same level of support; Sean was, in fact, released with a one-off discharge payment of ¬£46. That was it.\\" Compensatory action can be difficult to obtain. A compensation fund exists \\"from which, unbelievably, the government deducts 'board and lodging' for the time spent in prison.\\" In the years it can take for the funds to be cleared, many victims of miscarriages of justice live off social security payments. Gerry Conlon, who was wrongly imprisoned for 15 years, also warns that after-release support is inadequate. After the imposed routine of prison life, outside prison \\"you are lost\\". Suicidal thoughts and attempts, panic attacks, nightmares and drug use are common. \\"Most people released after miscarriages of justice end up as recluses, their marriages fail, they aren't talking to their children, they become drug addicts and alcoholics, they die premature deaths.\\" Hodgson's release has sparked debate about the use of the death penalty, particularly about its fallibility. Neil Durkin of Amnesty International commented in a piece for The Daily Telegraph: \\"[W]e had the deeply sad case of Sean Hodgson, the man from Hampshire who ended up being behind bars for 27 years, not least because the prosecution service suppressed exculpatory DNA evidence that could have set him free a decade earlier. He was totally innocent, should never have been imprisoned in the first place and on release joins the ranks of those ‚Äì eventually ‚Äì rescued from their judicial fate\\".

Its fundamental objective is given as promoting links between Turkey and the Conservative Party at all levels, by working with local and national party organisations, business groups and academia. Other aims include fostering enhanced bilateral trade relationships and increasing awareness of the Conservative Party within the Turkish-speaking communities in the UK. The group also lobbies in favour of Turkish membership of the EU and highlights Turkey‚Äôs importance as an ally of the UK. CFT lists the following activities to achieve these aims: by providing information on Turkey through regular briefings and newsletters; by organising meetings and events in Britain, Turkey and Belgium; and by arranging British parliamentary delegations to Turkey. Membership CFT counts 21 MPs, 4 peers and 2 MEPs among its founders Founder Members - Conservative Friends of Turkey. The three original founding members of the organisation were Councillor Ertan Hurer and Dr Onur Cetin, both of Turkish ancestry living in the UK and Dr Riza Kadilar. Activities Recent CFT activities include: the official launch with Foreign Secretary Rt Hon William Hague MP, launch of the Brussels branch with Daniel Hannan MEP and Geoffrey Van Orden OBE MEP, a joint dinner with Cities of London and Westminster Conservative Association and a joint reception with Westminster North Conservative Association hosting Defence Secretary Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP. Following the UK referendum on EU membership the CFT has been active in lobbying the Conservative Government to foster a closer relationship with Turkey and held a fringe meeting at the 2016 Party Conference titled \\"Turkey and the EU, building bridges post Brexit\\". The CFT takes great care not to criticise Turkey. It has made no comment on Turkish actions in Syria, Libya, Kurdistan and its provocations against Greece and Cyprus. CFT Cofounder Daniel Hannan tweeted that he was happier to see Aghia Sophia in Instanbul used as a mosque than as a museum.

The film had the working titles of At Your Age and Dummy Husbands. Harry Langdon, Betty Blythe, Esther Muir and others in the cast were stars in silent films. It was Gig Young's film debut. Plot summary Absent-minded department store owner Henry Butler (Harry Langdon), forgetting his wedding anniversary, ends up working late and missing the surprise party thrown by his wife, Effie (Betty Blythe). Trying to get away from work, he is spotted with a mannequin, which he is intends to get repaired, by a friend of his wife who thinks it is a blonde girl with whom Henry is having an affair. Other bystanders think it is a murder victim and call the police. Henry is picked up by the police and kept for interrogation until the wee hours of the morning, but his troubles are just starting. Effie has overheard the gossip spread amongst her party guests and, seeing Henry come home with one of the mannequin's shoes and blonde hair on his clothes, fears the worst. She is urged on by her friend, Grace Norman (Esther Muir), and an unscrupulous lawyer, Gilbert Wayne (Gayne Whitman), to file for a divorce. Henry and Effie both have their own lawyers who advise that since neither one will leave the family home they need witnesses that the couple are living apart to facilitate the divorce proceedings. Due to Henry's alleged violent temper, Effie's lawyer also demands she have a bodyguard; a thug named Gooch who stays at the home. When Effie decides to stop the divorce, a little scene is staged by the lawyer. His girlfriend, Nan, poses as the blonde Henry was supposedly seeing and convinces Effie to proceed. It is only then that the live-in witnesses, her niece Jane (Luana Walters) and Henry's friend Bob Grant (Ralph Byrd), notice that the shoe Henry brought back that night is about a size four; too small for Nan. Jane also notices that Gooch and Nan seem to recognise each other and trick Gooch into calling Nan. They overhear her location on an extension phone and get the truth out of her. A drunken Henry drags the mannequin all over town, only to meet the police, Effie and her lawyer waiting for him at home.

They were Tarbikha, Saliha, Malkiyeh, Nabi Yusha, Qadas, Hunin, and Abil al-Qamh.Kaufman (2006). The 1922 census also listed the Muslim minority in al-Bassa as Shia, but Kaufman determined they were actually Sunni. These villages were transferred from the French to the British sphere as a result of the border agreement of 1923. All of them were depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and their former locations are now in northern Israel. History At the end of World War I, the British and French governments held most of the Levant under military occupation, with Britain controlling Palestine apart from the northernmost parts, and France controlling Syria and Lebanon. These were administered under the military Occupied Enemy Territorial Administrations (OETA). After the 1919 Treaty of Versailles prescribed the division of the region into mandates, it was decided at the San Remo conference of May 1920 that Britain would have the Mandate for Palestine while France would have the Mandate for Syria and Lebanon. In September 1920, the first French high commissioner General Henri Gouraud, announced the birth of the state of Greater Lebanon. On 23 December, the British and French signed an agreement that broadly defined the boundary between their respective spheres. The agreement also established the Paulet-Newcombe commission to determine the precise boundary, with wide powers to recommend adjustments. In 1921, before the commission had reported, France conducted a census which covered the seven villages and granted Lebanese citizenship to their residents. None of the villages were listed in the 1922 census of Palestine. However, the commission decided on border adjustments which placed the villages on the Palestinian side of the border, along with more than a dozen other villages. The new boundary was agreed in a treaty of September 1923. The citizenship of the residents was not changed to Palestinian until 1926. The 1931 census counted 4,100 Metawalis in Palestine. Abil al-Qamh was about half Shia and half Greek Christian, while the other six were mostly Shia. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, all of the villages were depopulated. Their residents mostly fled as refugees to Lebanon, though some remained in Israel as internally displaced persons. Israeli communities partly or completely on the lands of the former villages include Yuval, Shomera, Zar'it, Shtula, Margaliot, Ramot Naftali, Yir'on, Yiftah, and Malkia. In 1994, the refugees from the seven villages, who had been classified as Palestinian refugees since 1948, were granted Lebanese citizenship. Some factions in the Lebanese government, Hezbollah in particular, have called for the seven villages to be \\"returned to Lebanon\\".

These companies design, engineer, and build high performance parts for the automobile and marine aftermarket and military customers. Located in Azusa, California, the company develops technology and components for both gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, but is best known for advancing development of the turbocharger and ultra high performance diesel engines for racing and street purposes. Banks- powered race vehicles have won numerous marine racing events and championships, and have set many speed records. These include \\"World‚Äôs Fastest Passenger Car\\" and \\"World‚Äôs Fastest Diesel Truck\\". The Banks Sidewinder S-10, built from the ground up at Gale Banks Engineering, produces 1250 horsepower and is the \\"world's fastest and quickest diesel drag truck\\" with a 7.72 second elapsed time and 179+ mph top speed in the quarter mile. These records have been certified by official motor racing sanctioning organizations, including the FIA and NHRA, and are detailed in the History below. Banks Power products include ECM-tuning devices, and intake and exhaust airflow systems for diesel- powered pickup trucks and recreational vehicles. Diesel Performance, Trailer Life, and other magazines have reported that these Banks Power products deliver significantly improved horsepower and torque measurements while yielding an up to 10% improvement in fuel mileage. History 1958: Gale Banks begins his career as a hot rodder by modifying the engine in his mother's car. He founds \\"C.P's Auto & Marine Racing Engines\\" as a way to fund his college expenses at Cal Poly, Pomona. 1966: Banks modifies a 1953 Studebaker and drives it to class records at El Mirage Dry Lake and the Bonneville Salt Flats with a top speed of 184.52 mph, as certified by the Southern California Timing Association. 1970: First Banks-branded turbo marine racing engine is built. Gale Banks Engineering and Banks Power engines win the American Power Boat Association (APBA) & NJBA (National Jet Boat Association) Jet Class national championship. 1974: The Banks/Brunette tunnel boat powered by a 398 cubic inch engine developed by Gale Banks Engineering and Banks Power wins the first of five consecutive APBA Endurance Tunnel Hull national championships. 1976: The \\"Crucifier\\", a race boat powered by a Banks fuel- injected nitro HEMI wins every event it enters, including the NDBA (National Drag Boat Association) and APBA nationals. 1978: Gale Banks Engineering is contracted by N.I.S.T.A. in the Department of Transportation to develop the power train for its Large Research Safety Vehicle (L.S.R.V.) program. When finished, it met proposed 1985 fuel and emission standards. This year also saw Banks develop the world‚Äôs first electronically injected oxygen-sensing turbocharged engine for Volvo. 1980: The U.S. Navy Seals contract Banks to develop an experimental twin-turbo marine engine that produces 535-hp and runs on 84-octane \\"Battle Gas\\". 1981: Banks creates the high performance diesel aftermarket with his first turbocharger system developed for the 6.2 litre GM diesel. Also that year, a Banks-powered 450-hp twin-turbo Buick V-6 becomes the prototype for the Buick Grand National production car. 1982: The ‚ÄúSundowner‚Äù Corvette, powered by a Banks twin-turbo big block, becomes the \\"World's Fastest Passenger Car\\" at 240 mph, taking the record away from the \\"Hanky Panky\\" Studebaker, which also used a Banks-developed twin-turbo power plant. This year also saw the Banks twin-turbo powered S-1 Express take an APBA world championship. 1984: A street-legal Pontiac Trans Am with 700-hp and a Banks turbo breaks the 200 mph barrier and becomes a cover story for Car & Driver magazine. 1987: A Banks Power twin-turbo, 1800-hp Pontiac GTA sets a new \\"World's Fastest Passenger Car\\" speed record at Bonneville Salt Flats at 277 mph as certified by the Southern California Timing Association.

Also known as Samson, he was born in Arua on 7 October 1990. He has an eye for goal, power, pace and can shoot from distance with both feet. Senior career He burst onto the national scene in 2007 with a brace for Arua-based Ugandan Super League debutants Ediofe Hills FC against URA FC. He was instantly called to the Cranes putting in a solid performance in CECAFA later that year. The following year, Bunamwaya S.C. bought him for a national record 12 Million Shillings. A back injury in September 2008 laid him off for two months but returned strongly to end the season as third best scorer with 18 goals. He was named in the 2009 African Championship of Nations Uganda squad. He proved his worth by scoring five goals in a single league game as his team demolished Sharing FC 10-1. In 2010, Okhuti helped Bunamwaya win their first USL title.Okhuti Chose Red Eagles To Express Himself On 20 May 2011, Okhuti signed a contract with Xi mang The Vissai Ninh B√¨nh in Vietnam's V.League 1 where he scored four goals within three months. He returned in January 2012 to play for Bunamwaya. During the exciting end to the season, defending champions URA FC and Express FC were tied atop the league table with 51 points. Okhuti's club was only one point behind but had to face URA which had beaten Bunamwaya 1-0 in the Bell Uganda Cup tournament the preceding month at Pece Stadium in Gulu. A win for Bunamwaya and anything less than a win for Express would make the 2010 champs repeat their unprecedented feat. Caesar scored the late winner in a 1-0 victory but Express won their game 2-1 against BIDCO. So, Bunamwaya settled for second and rebranded to Vipers. Personal issues and injury niggles kept Caesar unheard of in 2013. Okhuti joined South Sudan's El Nasir and was supposed to play the whole of 2014 but didn't. He came back home to help Arua-based Onduparaka FC get promotion in the Ugandan Big League. In the 2016 Azam Uganda Premier League, Okhuti became a Red Eagle and led in scoring as Express remained unbeaten at the start of the season. He said, \\"The Most Important Reason why I went to Express is that it's a place where you can express yourself.\\" He was named Player of the Month in September 2015. On Saturday 5 December 2015 at Addis Ababa Stadium in Ethiopia, Okhuti fiercely headed in the only goal against Rwanda to win a record-extending 14th CECAFA Senior Challenge Cup for Uganda. It was the fourth time Uganda had defeated Rwanda in the final (2003, 2009, 1011, 2015) and first time Uganda's Serbian Coach Milutin \\"Micho\\" Sredojevic had won it, having lost four years behind to Uganda while coaching Rwanda. Caesar scored three goals in the tournament like his captain and St. Mary's Kitende old boy Farouk Miya. Okhuti attributes his comeback to \\"change of attitude\\". His head won the cup,Caesar Okhuti Head Wins CECAFA Cup for Uganda but Okhuti modestly thinks he is not good at heading. It was his second CECAFA (Council for East and Central African Football Associations) Cup win.Uganda Beat Rwanda 1-0 To Win The 2015 CECAFA Cup On course to revamp his career, Okhuti was included in the Cranes squad for CHAN 2016. As a free agent, he swapped his Express jersey for bitter rivals KCCA FC based in Lugogo. In September 2016, KCCA loaned him for six months to Onduparaka, the newly promoted side from Arua. FUFA cleared him to play for Onduparaka on 28 September 2016 and three days later he scored once in a 4-3 win over SC Villa. Caeser has made appearances in double figures for Onduparaka FC and scored as many goals in the process including spectacular ones, West Nile sports journalist Vicente Da Costa Jr. of Radio Pacis once branded Caeser \\"the Best Footballer from Arua ever\\". Onduparaka FC could end up signing him on permanent basis from KCCA FC at the end of the 2016/17 Azam Uganda Premier League season where Onduparaka finished fifth in their maiden season. He looks up to Red Eagles legend Hassan Mubiru and Thierry Henry. His Favourite Clubs are Express and Arsenal F.C. plus his Biggest Influence was King Joel, a games master at Mvara S.S (Arua). Caesar is a GOD-fearing and devoted Christian who speaks Lugbara, English, Luganda and Swahili. He studied at St. Joseph's College Ombaci and St. Mary's Kitende.

Route description The route starts at its intersection with State Route 14 in Cedar Canyon. From here it travels north approximately north to its terminus at the south boundary of Cedar Breaks National Monument. While the route ends here, continuing north along the road into the park leads to Utah's Patchwork Parkway/Brian Head-Lake Panguitch Scenic Byway (SR-143). History State Route 55 was designated by the Utah State Legislature in 1927, connecting SR-14 at Cedar Breaks Junction with the southern boundary of Cedar Breaks National Monument. However, as part of a major realignment of state highways, SR-55 was deleted in 1969, and the route was designated as part of SR-143. This left SR-143 as a non-contiguous highway, as the portion going through the national monument was not part of the highway designation. In 1985, the southern portion of SR-143 between SR-14 and the southern Cedar Breaks National Monument boundary was re-designated State Route 148, with no further changes to this highway.

As a cricketer, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman who bowled occasional slow left-arm orthodox spin, and a fearless fielder at short leg.Cricketer, November 1977, p. 51.

He was the chief executive of Burnley. In February 2018 he published with Alastair Campbell a co-written novel on football and terrorism in the 1970s, Saturday Bloody Saturday. which within the first week after publication was in The Sunday Times Top Ten Bestsellers. Early years Paul Fletcher attended Smithills Technical School in Bolton Bolton Wanderers v Fulham football programme, 15 March 1969, p5 and in 1967 joined his home town club Bolton Wanderers. In 1970, he became one of the country's most expensive transfers when he joined Burnley Football Club for a club record fee. During the next ten years he made over 400 appearances, mostly in the old First Division ‚Äì now named the Premier League. After gaining four England U23 International caps he was selected in Don Revie's England squad, but a serious knee injury put paid to a full England call up. A second serious leg injury forced his early retirement at the age of 32. After playing Following a sixteen-year career as a professional footballer he has now become one of Europe's leading stadium experts, joining a rare breed of former professional footballers who have successfully made the transition from 'teamsheet to balancesheet'. His commercial career in football began at Colne Dynamoes F.C. in the late 1980s. Since then he has served as Chief Executive at Huddersfield Town where, over a six-year period, he masterminded the award- winning Alfred McAlpine Stadium, voted the RIBA 'Building of the Year 'in 1995. In 1996, he then returned to his old club Bolton Wanderers F.C. as Chief Executive at the new ¬£40 million Reebok Stadium, the BCI Building of the Year in 1998. In 1999, after two years at the Reebok, he was invited by the FA to become Commercial Director of the new ¬£500 million Wembley National Stadium. After eighteen months, as costs escalated, he walked away from the project commenting that he 'needed to spend more time with his wife and family in the Lancashire sunshine'. Arena construction Within weeks he took up the position as Chief Executive of Arena Coventry Limited to head-up the construction and delivery of the proposed ¬£64 million Ricoh Arena in Coventry, which is destined to become one of the country's largest sports and leisure venues. This includes a 32,000 seat stadium for Coventry City, the largest casino in the UK, two hotels, an exhibition centre, health and fitness club and a wide range of community facilities. Club director On 1 January 2006 he was invited to join the Board of Coventry City Football Club as Managing Director.

The first conference occurred in 1986 at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. Subsequent conferences have been held in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018. Conferences Robert Schadewald emphasized the influence Kurt Wise has had on shaping a more candid and rigorous approach to creationism, particularly praising a talk entitled \\"How Geologists Date Things\\" as absolutely straight Geology 101 mixing introductory geology with a debunking of creationist misconceptions. Wise has labored tirelessly by example and persuasion to convince his creationist colleagues to study the facts carefully and find new ways to interpret them. Besides technical and educational tracks, ICC86 featured a \\"basic creationism\\" track that included Walter Brown's Hydroplate Model (some creationists privately referred to it as the \\"wacky track\\"). The second ICC, held in 1990, was marginally better, but evolution-bashing and \\"wacky track\\" nonsense still were abundant. The 1990 conference featured a debate between Gregg Wilkerson, an old-earth creationist geologist and Steven A. Austin, chairman of geology at the Institute for Creation Research. Wilkerson urged the conference attendees to drop the young Earth viewpoint and accept the \\"ample scientific evidence\\" that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. Austin stated that Wilkerson was misinterpreting the data and that a young Earth viewpoint remained feasible. Following ICC90, the Pittsburgh Creation Science Fellowship (CSF) established a refereeing system. Wise and philosophers Paul Nelson and John Mark Reynolds convinced CSF that evolution-bashing never has advanced and never will advance a real \\"creation model.\\" As a result, ICC94 was dramatically better. At ICC98, the transformation was virtually complete. Most presentations tried either to advance a model in some way or at least to honestly review the evidence that needs explaining. This requirement was stated in the call for papers and enforced in the refereeing process, Anyone whose only exposure to creationism is a Gish Gallop would not have recognized a single presentation at ICC98. Larry Witham described it as having \\"become the preeminent meeting of its kind in the world.\\" Its goal is to provide a peer-review forum wherein the Creation model could be rigorously developed. He states that the conferences express similar disdain for both \\"slipshod\\" populist young earth creationism, and for smuggling in \\"antiquity and evolution\\".

He is best known for the 1997 film Kiss Me, Guido. More recently, Vitale pioneered the use of IPTV technologies and broadcast TV programming to help create dedicated OTT streaming channels. Early life Vitale was born in the Bronx. His father, Anthony, worked for the Dept. of Transportation of New York City and died when his son was 13. His mother, Mildred, worked as an aide in the New York City Department of Education. Vitale graduated from Christopher Columbus High School and from Iona College with a degree in finance and minor in communications. Vitale worked at the New York Public Library after school and worked on weekends as a DJ. On the last day of his internship on Wall Street during his senior year in college, Vitale stopped into the Club Med offices in New York City and interviewed for a position as a DJ with Club Med. After graduating with honors, Vitale soon traveled to different locations around the world working for Club Med. After meeting a Specialist from the New York Stock Exchange, he returned to New York where he was hired as a clerk on Wall Street. He began writing screenplays and teleplays while taking film courses at night at New York University.  Film and television career  While working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange including during the infamous day known as Black Monday, Vitale attended film classes at night at New York University. After the death of his mother in 1990, Vitale began working in the film and television industry as a location assistant, eventually working his way up as a second unit director for the opening shot of Robert De Niro‚Äôs, A Bronx Tale. In 1996, Vitale wrote and directed the feature film, Kiss Me, Guido which became an official entry in the 1997 Sundance Film Festival and was released by Paramount Pictures to favorable reviews the same year. \\"Mr. Vitale makes his first feature with the same kind of colloquial New York humor that Edward Burns gave The Brothers McMullen. A former location manager, he shows off a sure familiarity with his settings while he makes his audience enjoy the very bluntness of his film's caricatures. In 1999, Vitale thought the time was right to pitch his idea again of turning \\"Kiss Me, Guido\\" into a show of its own. The pitch wound up with the Axelrod-Widdoes production company (\\"Can't Hurry Love\\" and \\"Brother's Keeper\\"), who were without a project at the time. Production company co-founder Jonathan Axelrod was married to actress Illeana Douglas, who was good friends with Craig Chester, who co-starred in the film. Douglas rented the movie and screened it for her husband, who saw the series potential. Sitcom veteran Marc Cherry, was brought in to help develop/produce the series, and he and Vitale instantly hit it off. The series was renamed, Some of My Best Friends starring Jason Bateman and Danny Nucci and ran for eight episodes on the CBS Television network. Vitale's second film, Very Mean Men, won the 2000 Seattle International Film Festival: New American Cinema Award. The film starred Martin Landau and Louise Fletcher along with Matthew Modine, Ben Gazzara, Charles Durning and Burt Young. Vitale's third film, Life's A Beach, stars Christopher Walken, Rutger Hauer, Robert Wagner and Morgan Fairchild. Vitale also directed One Last Ride starring Pat Cupo, Chazz Palminteri and Robert Davi, with Oscar Winner Ang Lee as executive producer. Vitale also co-produced the feature film Man From Elysian Fields starring Andy Garcia, Mick Jagger, James Coburn, and Anjelica Huston in 2002. Vitale continues to work in television/multimedia, producing shows for CBS, NBC and FOX television, and in 2012, pioneered OTT/IPTV technologies as Executive Producer and Director of Programming for the financial news network, tastytrade, with Tom Sosnoff. The tastytrade financial news network features 8 hours of live programming, Monday through Friday, during open hours of the financial markets delivering interactive content to its trading platform, tastyworks. . While at tastytrade, Vitale directed and produced documentaries including Cancel Crash about Black Monday the Crash of 1987, aired on PBS, and SOLD!: The Lewis Borsellino Story, about a Chicago Southside native who came to be one of the most legendary S&P; pit traders in history.

The vernacular name in China is ÊªáÁâ°‰∏π (diƒÅn m√π dƒÅn), which means \\"Yunnan peony\\". In English it is sometimes called Delavay's tree peony. It mostly has red brown to yellow, nodding flowers from mid May to mid June. The light green, delicate looking deciduous leaves consist of many segments, and are alternately arranged on new growth.  Description  Paeonia delavayi is a deciduous hairless shrub of ¬º-1¬æ m high. Plants have creeping stolons and the roots are thick because they are fused together. It mainly reproduces by growing into large clones like this. Young twigs are light green, or tinged purple, rarely branching, erect, generally on top of perennial, stick-like, grayish to light brown stems. In lower plants, woody parts may not be present above ground. Like all diploid peonies, it has ten chromosomes (2n=10).  Leaves  The leaves are arranged alternately around the stem. In the lower leaves the leaf stalk is 10‚Äì15 cm long and the leaf blade is oval in outline, 15‚Äì30 cm long and 10‚Äì22 cm wide, twice compounded or very deeply incised, first into three to eleven leaflets, themselves deeply divided or lobed into two to eleven secondary lobes (this is called biternate). These are linear to linear-lanceolate in shape and have an entire margin or incidentally may have a few teeth. Usually each lower leaf has between twenty five and one hundred segments (full range 17 to 312). The width of the leaf segments is ¬Ω-2¬æ cm. Higher along the stem leaves becoming smaller with fewer leaflets and segments.  Flowers  As usual in peonies, there is a gradation between leaves, bracts and sepals. One to five bracts defined as those immediately below the calyx, have various shapes, ranging from incised and leaf-like to entire and sepal-like. Sepals are rounded or triangular-rounded, mostly green, but sometimes with a pink inside, dark red or purple. They have a much broader base and a smaller, narrower, rounded or suddenly pointed (or mucronate) dark green tip. The number of bracts and sepals together varies up to 10 or 11, sometimes forming a less or more conspicuous involucre. The nodding flowers open from mid May to mid June, are sometimes single but usually two or three together on a branch, one at the end and the others in the axil of the leaves. The color of the petals also varies between and within populations from red, dark red, or dark purple-red, mostly in the northeast the range, and yellow either or not with a dark red spot at the base towards the South and West, and sometimes petals may be yellow with a red margin, orange, green-yellow, or white. The number of petals ranges from four to thirteen. Between 25 and 160 stamens have yellow, pale red, red, or dark red filaments topped by yellow, orange, red, or purple anthers. Although flowers with red brown petals usually have red to purple filaments and anthers, both filaments and anthers can also be yellow in such flowers. The fleshy disk at the base of the carpels is short, ring-shaped or forms a short cylinder 1‚Äì3 mm high, with teeth, green, yellowish, yellow, red, or dark red in color. The disk may secrete nectar which gives off a scent. There are mostly two to four rarely up to eight carpels. The ovary is mostly green, but sometimes purple, is topped by a yellow-green, yellow, red, or purple-red stigma, and contains seven to seventeen ovules in each carpel. These develop into fruits (so-called follicles) which are long ovoid in shape, 2-3¬Ω √ó 1-1¬Ω cm, which are brown when ripe in August, and contain between one and six brown-black seeds each.  Variability  Putative taxa have been recognized that have been said to differ by the presence of an involucre (P. delavayi), maroon-red petals in P. delavayi and P. potaninii, yellow in P. lutea and P. potaninii var. trollioides, white in P. potaninii forma alba, and narrower leaf segments in P. potaninii.  Differences with related species  habit of a maroon- colored specimenPaeonia delavayi is closely related to P. ludlowii. It can be distinguished easily because it reproduces mainly by stolons, has fused roots, stems emerge from the ground individually, is only up to 1¬æ m high, has segmented leaves with narrow and acute segments, variously colored petals, stamens, disk, and stigmas, has two to eight carpels, which develop in small follicles (2-3¬Ω √ó 1-1¬Ω cm) and rarely produce seeds. P. ludlowii on the other hand can only reproduce by seed and lacks creeping underground stems, has slender, regular roots, while the stems form a clump, grows to 2-3¬Ω m high, has leaves with short and suddenly pointed lobes, petals, stamens, disk and stigmas are always yellow, only one or very rarely two carpels develop but this grows into a much larger follicle (4¬æ-7 √ó 2-3‚Öì cm) which always develops seeds. Taxonomy  Paeonia delavayi is problematic because taxonomists differ on the number and status of taxa that should be distinguished in this group.  Taxonomic history  P. delavayi with maroon-red and P. lutea with yellow flowers, both from Northwest Yunnan were described respectively by Adrien Ren√© Franchet and Delavay, on the same page of the same scientific article in 1886. In 1904 Finet and Gagnepain thought these should both be regarded varieties of P. delavayi. Komarov described P. potaninii from West Sichuan in 1921, with smaller, deep maroon-red flowers and narrower leaf segments. In 1931 Stern adds P. trollioides from Northwest Yunnan with yellow flowers shaped like those of Trollius, growing more erect and having larger fruits, which he reduces to P. potaninii var. trollioides in 1946, in addition to recognizing P. potaninii, P. delavayi and P. lutea. In 1953 Stern in cooperation with George Taylor described one more taxon, P. lutea var. ludlowii, discovered in southeastern Tibet. Fang in 1958 agreed with Stern but ignored P. lutea var. ludlowii. Wu renamed P. potaninii to P. delavayi var. angustiloba and distinguished P. lutea from P. delavayi in 1984. In 1990 Gong recognized P. delavayi, P. lutea, P. potaninii, P. potaninii var. trollioides, and added P. potaninii forma alba with white petals. Pan (1979, 1993) on the other hand only recognized P. delavayi including var. lutea and var. angustiloba, but did not mention P. lutea var. ludlowii.  Modern classification  Paeonia delavayi is variable in the number and shape of the leaflets and in the number, size, and color of all parts of the flower both within and between populations. Character states occur in all combinations. Nowadays only one species, P. delavayi, is acknowledged, without infraspecific taxa. Paeonia lutea, P. potaninii, and P. trollioides are all regarded as synonyms of P. delavayi. P. lutea var. ludlowii was shown to differ in a number of characters and is now named Paeonia ludlowii.  Phylogeny  Paeonia is the only genus recognized in the family Paeoniaceae. Three sections are distinguished: an early branching Onaepia that consists of both native North-American species P. brownii and P. californica, section Paeonia, which comprises all Eurasian herbaceous species, and the section Moutan, which includes all woody species from China, including Tibet. These relations are represented by the following tree. cited on  Etymology  Paeonia delavayi is named after Father Jean Marie Delavay, a French Catholic missionary in China, who collected plants.  Distribution  Paeonia delavayi is endemic to southwestern China, where it is limited to Sichuan, Yunnan and the very South-East of Tibet.  Ecology  Paeonia delavayi almost exclusively reproduces through stolons, and seedlings are rare to find. This allows for rapid colonization after a seed has arrived at a new location, such as on newly stabilized debris. In combination with its thick roots this makes this species well adapted to colonize open habitat, that may be prone to drying out quickly. Local populations may consist of only one clone. It grows in light shade such as moist Picea likiangensis forest or dry and open Pinus densata-Quercus gilliana forest, and sometimes on grassy slopes or in glades. It grows at 2000-3600 m altitude. Insects feed on the fruits and limit seed development.  Conservation  P. delavayi has been listed as endangered by the China Plant Red Data Book, and may be under threat if digging out roots for medicine on a large scale is not adequately controlled. However, because it easily reproduces vegetatively and is relatively widely distributed, it may not go extinct shortly if overexploitation of the root for medicine will be adequately controlled.  Cultivation  Paeonia delavayi is cultivated as an ornamental in gardens. In China, it is cultivated to produce a traditional medicine. It is said to be grown with ease, preferring a neutral or limy, deep rich soil in sun or partial shade. It is however sensitive to stagnant water at the roots and does best in soils with good drainage, such as in raised beds. Planting tree peonies in a sheltered position may help to prevent strong winds from breaking branches, particularly during flowering. Tree peonies in general can suffer from peony wilt (Botrytis paeoniae, a grey mould blight) and verticillium wilt, which may cause wilting and dieback of young shoots. In infected soils, honey fungus can cause instant death.  Culture varieties  Crossbreeding of yellow-flowered P. delavayi with double-flowered P. suffruticosa by √âmile Lemoine has led to the introduction of the color yellow into the cultivated double-flowered tree-peonies. These hybrids are known as the P. √ólemoinii-group, and include double-flowered \\"Chromatella\\" (1928), \\"Alice Harding\\" (1935) and semidouble-flowered \\"Sang Lorraine\\" (1939). In 1948 horticultulturist Toichi Itoh from Tokyo used pollen from \\"Alice Harding\\" to fertilize the herbaceous P. lactiflora \\"Katoden\\", which resulted in a new category of peonies, the Itoh or intersectional cultivars. These are herbaceous, have leaves like tree peonies, with many large flowers from late spring to early autumn, and good peony wilt resistance. Some of the early Itoh cultivars are \\"Yellow Crown\\", \\"Yellow Dream\\", \\"Yellow Emperor\\" and \\"Yellow Heaven\\".

Early life He was born in 1943 the son of Percy Saltzman, Canada's first English-speaking TV weatherman, and Rose Cohen.CBC News, Jan 17 2007 After briefly studying mathematics and science, he did congressional civil rights lobbying in Washington, D.C., and in the summer of 1965 he did voter registration work in Mississippi as part of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which would later lead him to go back to the area to explore the concept of prejudice and racism with his first documentary feature film, Prom Night in Mississippi. He lives in the Toronto area, and has one daughter, Devyani Saltzman, a writer and literary curator, with his ex-wife, director and screenwriter Deepa Mehta. His partner is Anne Peace, a writer and joyologist. The Beatles In 1968, at the age of 23, he traveled to India for the first time as sound engineer on the National Film Board of Canada's Juggernaut documentary. He studied meditation to recover after his girlfriend had broken up with him, by mail. He learned meditation at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in the holy city of Rishikesh, India, The Beatles were coincidentally also visiting the ashram. He saw them sitting at a table and asked to join them. Paul McCartney drew up a chair.BBC.com, \\"When a 'heartbroken' backpacker met The Beatles in India,\\" September 13, 2020 While there, he spent time with and photographed the Beatles, Donovan, Mia and Prudence Farrow and Mike Love.

A permanent exhibition of his The Beatles in India photographs can be seen above the retail units in the departure lounge of Liverpool John Lennon Airport. In 2000, Saltzman released a book of his photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, with Penguin-Putnam; and in 2006 he self-published a deluxe limited edition box set, The Beatles in India.Calcutta Telegraph , \\"Long and Winding Road to Rishikesh,\\" March 27, 2005 In 2018, the 50th anniversary of the Beatles time at the ashram, Insight Editions published a hardcover trade edition of 'The Beatles in India'. One of the most memorable things Saltzman absorbed during his conversations and life-changing stay with The Beatles was George Harrison's words: \\"Like we're The Beatles, after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?\\"Calcutta Telegraph, Calcutta, India, March 27, 2005. Saltzman has been to India over 60 times. He led special tours of India in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2018. Called \\"India with Paul Saltzman: A Fusion of Colour, Music & Soul\\", it shares his love of and favourite places in India. Included is how India impacted The Beatles, and led to the group's most creative musical period.http://www.bestway.com/itineraries/beatles_india.php The Beatles In India Tour, Bestway Tours and Safaris website. Film and TV career Saltzman began his film and television career at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a researcher, interviewer and on-air host, and then moved to the National Film Board of Canada. He assisted in the launch of a new film format as second-unit director and production manager of the first IMAX film, produced for the Osaka Expo '70. In 1972, he produced and directed his first film, a half-hour documentary on Bo Diddley. In 1967 and again in 1972, Saltzman interviewed Buckminster Fuller on film. On this second occasion, Fuller told Saltzman \\"You changed my idea of the 60's generation. Before I met you, I thought it was a lost generation.\\" In 1973, Saltzman founded Sunrise Films Limited. He produced and directed documentaries for the next decade, including the award-winning series Spread Your Wings. His work included producing, directing, writing, editing, cinematography and sound recording. In 1983, he turned to drama, producing and directing the premiere of HBO's Family Playhouse and a special for American Playhouse. That year, he co-created and produced the family action-adventure television series Danger Bay; the hit CBC‚ÄìDisney Channel series ran for six years and 123 episodes. Since then he has produced television series such as My Secret Identity, Matrix and Max Glick, as well as miniseries and movies of the week. He co- produced the feature film Map of the Human Heart, an international epic directed by Vincent Ward, starring Jason Scott Lee, Anne Parillaud, Patrick Bergin, John Cusack and Jean Moreau. He also executive produced Martha, Ruth & Edie as well as Sam & Me, which received an Honorable Mention in competition for the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2020, his feature documentary based on his experiences with the Beatles in India, 'Meeting the Beatles in India' was released. Saltzman is a member of the Director's Guild of Canada and the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television.

In Tibet it is known as lumaidao meaning \\"God‚Äôs flower\\". The vernacular name in China is Â§ßËä±ÈªÑÁâ°‰∏π (da hua huang mu dan) meaning \\"big yellow-flowered peony\\". In English it is sometimes called Tibetan tree peony or Ludlow's tree peony. It has pure yellow, slightly nodding, bowl- shaped flowers, and large, twice compounded, light green leaves.  Description  young shoot with two flowerbuds P. ludlowii is a hairless, deciduous shrub of 2-3¬Ω m high. It has ten chromosomes (2n=10).  Stems and leaves  The roots get narrower further down and are not fused together. There are no creeping stems (or stolons). The grey to light brown stems grow in clumps (or caespitose), do not branch often, remain approximately the same width during the growing season, and after some years may reach 4 cm in diameter. Young stems are light green, with at their base eight to twelve scales. Leaves are light green above and glaucous pale green below. In the lowest leaves, the leaf stalk is 9‚Äì15 cm long, while the leaf blade is twice compounded or deeply divided (or biternate), with the primary leaflets on a short stem of 2‚Äì3 cm, the leaflet blades 6-12 √ó 5‚Äì13 cm, those usually incised almost to the base, having three segments, at base extending along the stalk until disappearing (or decurrent). Each of the segments 4-9 √ó 1¬Ω-4 cm, mostly incised to midlength into three lobes of 2-5 √ó ¬Ω-1¬Ω cm, with an entire margin or one or two teeth, pointy at their tips.  Inflorescence  The slightly nodding bisexual flowers grow with three to four on each shoot, extending from the axil of the leaves, they are 10‚Äì12 cm wide and sit on a flower stalk of 5‚Äì9 cm long, and open late May and early June. Each flower is subtended by four or five lance-shaped bracts. There are three to five green sepals with a rounded outline of 1¬Ω-2¬Ω cm, which have a rounded tip that suddenly narrows into a point. The pure yellow, inverted egg-shaped petals are spreading but slightly curved inwards, 5-5¬Ω √ó 2¬Ω-3¬Ω cm and have a rounded tip. The numerous filaments are yellow, 1-1¬Ω cm long, topped by yellow anthers of about 4 mm long. The yellow disk at the base of the carpels is ring-shaped, carries teeth, and about 1 mm high. At the centre of each flower are one or two carpels that are topped by yellow stigmas.  Fruit and seed  The carpels develop into cylindrical fruits (or follicles) of 4¬æ-7 √ó 2-3‚Öì cm. These contain eventually dark brown, globose seeds of 1‚Öì cm in August.  Differences with related species  Paeonia delavayi is closely related to P. ludlowii, but can easily be distinguished because it reproduces mainly by stolons, has fused roots, stems emerge from the ground individually, is only up to 1¬æ m high, has segmented leaves with narrow and acute segments. Petals, stamens, disk, and stigmas may be yellow, maroon, orange or white. It has two to eight carpels, which develop in small follicles (2-3¬Ω √ó 1-1¬Ω cm) and rarely produce seeds. P. ludlowii on the other hand can only reproduce by seed and lacks creeping underground stems, has slender, regular roots, while the stems form a clump, grows to 2-3¬Ω m high, has leaves with short and suddenly pointed lobes, petals, stamens, disk and stigmas are always yellow, only one or very rarely two carpels develop but this grows into a much larger follicle (4¬æ-7 √ó 2-3‚Öì cm) which always develops seeds. Other species of tree peony do not have yellow flowers, do not grow as large and generally have darker green foliage and darker brown bark. Some of the many cultivated cross-breeds of tree peonies may have yellow flowers, but these are not nodding, generally much larger, mostly double flowered, with darker green leaves and much lower.  Taxonomy  seedsIn 1886 P. delavayi with maroon-red and P. lutea with yellow flowers, both from Northwest Yunnan, were described respectively by Franchet and Delavay, on the same page of the same scientific article. In 1904 Finet and Gagnepain thought these should both be regarded varieties of P. delavayi. In 1953 F.C. Stern and George Taylor described one more taxon, P. lutea var. ludlowii, discovered in southeastern Tibet. In their description of Paeonia lutea var. ludlowii, these authors indicate that it is distinctly different from variety lutea. Recent analysis shows that these differences between ludlowii and the other described taxa in the P. delavayi-group are consistent whilst the character states within the other taxa occur in any combination. Therefore Hong concludes that ludlowii should be acknowledged as a distinct species, while the other taxa cannot be upheld and should be synonymized with P. delavayi.  Phylogeny  Paeonia is the only genus recognized in the family Paeoniaceae. Three sections are distinguished: an early branching Onaepia that consists of both native North American species P. brownii and P. californica, section Paeonia, which comprises all Eurasian herbaceous species, and the section Moutan, which includes all woody species from China, including Tibet. These relations are represented by the following tree.  Etymology  The species was named in his honor Frank Ludlow who collected seed of Paeonia ludlowii in the Tsangpo Valley (upper Brahmaputra river) in 1936, after which it became for the first time known to western science, on his expedition with Major George Sherriff in South-East Tibet.  Distribution and ecology  Paeonia ludlowii is an endemic that is restricted to the Nyingchi, Mainling and Lh√ºnz√™ counties of South-East Tibet. It grows in open forests, and thickets on dry rocky slopes at elevations of 3000-3500m. Individual populations are small in area but have a large number of individuals. Because the seeds are quite large, almost all seeds germinate close to the parent, and are often found in a large density. Perhaps rats are the most effective mains of seed dispersal to somewhat distanced new locations.  Cultivation  Paeonia ludlowii is sometimes grown as an ornamental, mostly for its delicate foliage. In cultivation, it does best in fertile, neutral to slightly alkaline, well-drained soil. Specimens prefer to be planted deep and dislike too much water. In early spring and during summer high-potash liquid feed stimulates richer flowering. When growing the species from seed, these can best first be soaked, mixed with damp vermiculite, and kept at room temperature until root emerges after one to three months. If kept cool afterwards, the shoot appears after a further two to three months. When these are planted into separate pots immediately and grown in daylight results are generally good. The shoot only appears at a root length of at least 6 cm has developed. The epicotyl remains dormant until the GA3/ABA ratio is sufficiently different. Tree peonies in general can suffer from peony wilt (Botrytis paeoniae, a grey mould blight) and verticillium wilt, which may cause wilting and dieback of young shoots. In infected soils, honey fungus can cause instant death.  Use  The species is used as a traditional medicine, and local people dig it up for its root bark. Exploitation by people from other parts of China is a serious threat to the survival of this species. It is sometimes used as an ornamental for its ferny foliage in botanical gardens and by plant collectors.

The common name used in China is ' (). Plants belonging to this group have been cultivated for millennia in China, initially only as a source of traditional Chinese medicine particularly the skin of its roots (). Already early on the plant was also cultivated for its ornamental value, and it is highly revered in Chinese culture.  Genetic analysis  Paeonia suffruticosa is the name used for most tree peony cultivars, but is not a naturally occurring species. So it can be regarded as the name for a man-made hybrid swarm. Genetic analysis has shown that five species of the subsection Vaginatae together make up the parentage of the tree peony cultivars created before World War II. In over three quarters of the almost fifty studied cultivars, the DNA of their chloroplasts is identical to that in Paeonia cathayana, indicating that this species is the original maternal parent. Almost all of the remaining cultivars has chloroplast DNA identical to that in P. qiui, and rarely from P. ostii and partially from Paeonia rotundiloba. In the nuclear DNA however, homology with Paeonia rockii is largest, with lesser contributions from P. qiui, P. ostii, P. cathayana and P. jishanensis. Paeonia decomposita is the only species from the Vaginatae that has not contributed to these cultivars.  Lemoine hybrids  Crossbreeding of yellow-flowered P. delavayi with traditional double-flowered P. suffruticosa cultivars by Victor Lemoine in Nancy has led to the introduction of the color yellow into the cultivated double-flowered tree- peonies. These hybrids are known as the Paeonia √ó lemoinei group, and include double-flowered ‚ÄòChromatella‚Äô (1928), ‚ÄòAlice Harding‚Äô (1935) and semidouble- flowered ‚ÄòSang Lorraine‚Äô (1939). The semi-double, lemon-yellow P. √ó lemoinei cultivar ‚ÄòHigh Noon‚Äô has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.  Itoh cultivars  In 1948 horticultulturist Toichi Itoh from Tokyo used pollen from ‚ÄòAlice Harding‚Äô to fertilize the herbaceous P. lactiflora ‚ÄòKatoden‚Äô, which resulted in a new category of peonies, the Itoh or intersectional cultivars. These are herbaceous, have leaves like tree peonies, with many large flowers from late spring to early autumn, and good peony wilt resistance. Some of the early Itoh cultivars are ‚ÄòYellow Crown‚Äô, ‚ÄòYellow Dream‚Äô, ‚ÄòYellow Emperor‚Äô and ‚ÄòYellow Heaven‚Äô. Cultivated hybrid tree peonies originate from China and its surrounding areas, possessing significant cultural meaning throughout Chinese history. Currently there are about 600 Chinese tree peony cultivars.\\"Hort Science\\" Applicability of Leaf Morphology and Intersimple Sequence Repeat Markers in Classification of Tree Peony.

Comparison with other peonies A flower of a tree peony in a garden in Queens, New York City, May 2007 Paeonia suffruticosa, also known as the tree peony, originates from China. Sometimes, people refer to these tree peonies as ‚ÄúChinese tree peonies.‚Äù Paeonia suffruticosa belongs to the peony family. The most distinctive feature is that Paeonia suffruticosa is a bush or a tree, whereas most peonies are herbaceous. Despite their classification as trees, it is the flowers that attract people's attention. Peonies are generally slow to grow and have flowers that only last briefly and are fragile under weather conditions such as wind, rain or hot temperatures. In comparison, Paeonia suffruticosa, as a tree, survives longer than the rest of the peonies. The woody stems of tree peonies allow the plant to survive in winter.\\"Paeonia Suffruticosa\\" Missouri Botanical Garden. \\"Paeonia suffruticosa - Plant Finder.\\" Missouri Botanical Garden. Retrieved 5 March 2014. In general, the plant is long-lived, and the flowers bloom longer in the early spring.  Etymology of scientific name  The name Paeonia suffruticosa is derived from two different sources. The genus name Paeonia derives from the name Paeon. In Greek mythology, Paeon was a disciple of the god of medicine, Ascleplus.\\"Tree Peonies\\" Tree Peonies. David Beaulieu. About.com Landscaping. Retrieved 5 March 2014. The species name \\"suffruticosa\\" is composed of two parts. The first part \\"suf-\\" is only a prefix; the second part \\"fruticosa\\", means shrub- like.  Cultivation  In order to propagate the bush, the seeds are collected in June when the seed pods split. They are air-dried for a few days and are then stored in moist soil before planting out during autumn. If the pods are fully dried out, it is more difficult for the seeds to sprout. Seeds that are harvested late or allowed to dry completely will not produce roots until the following spring and then do not send up shoots for another year. Ideally, the plant should be planted in fertile, humus-rich soil with plenty of organic matter (in USDA zones 3 to 8). Paeonia suffruticosa grows in both full sun to dappled shade. However, the plant blooms best in dappled shade with 3 to 4 hours of sunlight. When grown in full sun, it is essential to provide adequate moisture to the plant. Generally, the tree requires very little pruning, but it is necessary to cut off dead branches, and to cut off any sprouts that are suckers from the herbaceous root stock. Potential cultivating diseases include Ca. Phytoplasma solani, the causal agent of the Black wood disease of grapevine. This is associated with tree peony yellows disease in China.Identification of ‚ÄòCandidatus Phytoplasma solani‚Äô Associated with Tree Peony Yellows Disease in China.

During the Qing Dynasty (1644 -1911), the government in 1903 appointed Paeonia suffruticosa as China‚Äôs national flower.\\"National Flower, Tree, Bird to be Chosen\\" China Daily. \\"Environment.\\" National Flower, Tree, Bird to Be Chosen. Retrieved 5 March 2014. However, with political shifts and other factors, its title as the national flower was later replaced. In 1929, the plum tree was granted the title of national flower by the government at the time. Despite its loss of status of being the national flower, Paeonia suffruticosa maintains cultural significance. In China, it is generally known as the ‚Äúking of flowers‚Äù, symbolizing honor, wealth, and aristocracy, as well as love, affection, and feminine beauty. The tree peony has been frequently portrayed in significant Chinese works of literature and art.  China‚Äôs debate on the national flower  The People‚Äôs Republic of China has not yet chosen a national flower. Potential candidates include Paeonia suffruticosa, as well as the plum blossom, the chrysanthemum, the orchid, and the lotus. Paeonia suffruticosa and the plum blossom are currently the front-runners.\\"Debate over China's national flower\\" \\"Chinese media, advertising, and urban life.\\" Joel Martinsen. Debate over China's national flower. Retrieved 5 March 2014. Comparisons by cultural importance are inconclusive as to which flower is the most symbolic of China, as all these flowers have been portrayed with roughly equal frequency through centuries of literature and art. Elections for the national tree and national flower were held in the 1980s and 1994, but both elections ended with no final conclusion. Prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 Shanghai World Expo, the Chinese government again attempted to determine a national flower. Many Chinese citizens suggested copying the practices of countries such as France, Japan, and Thailand, by selecting two national flowers. 62 scholars from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering have proposed a ‚Äúdual national flower‚Äù plan to name both Paeonia suffruticosa and plum blossom to the position. With the Olympics and Expo approaching, the ongoing uncertainty over choosing a national flower led to the Chinese government publishing The Recommendation Concerning Setting the Peony and Plum Blossom as National Flowers as Early as Possible. The Recommendation pointed out that the lack of a flower is hindering the expansion of China‚Äôs flower culture and industry. This proposal was only one of several potential plans; other plans included choosing one, four, or five national flowers. The five flowers suggestion, known as ‚ÄúOne Country, Five Flowers‚Äù, proposed establishing Paeonia suffruticosa as the primary national flower, with four supplementary flowers representing each season of the year: the chrysanthemum would represent autumn, the plum blossom would represent winter, the orchid would represent spring, and the lotus would represent summer. Despite the proposals, China was not able to make a decision before the Olympics and Expo. The decision remains undecided.  As medicine Paeonia suffruticosa has a long history of being used in Chinese medicine. There are more than 1000 Chinese tree peony cultivars with various flower colors and flower forms that have been selected artificially for medicinal uses for more than 2000 years. The root bark, often referred to as Mu Dan Pi or Cortex Moutan, is the main part that is used in Chinese medicine. Mu Dan Pi‚Äôs main functions include reducing heat, cooling the blood, improving liver function, and mildly invigorating the blood. Mu Dan Pi of the best quality should be very fragrant, thick, white and starchy. The flower is now mostly cultivated for medicinal uses. Due to over-harvesting, the wild plant is threatened with extinction.  Chemistry  P. suffruticosa contains paeonol, galloyl-paeoniflorin, galloyl- oxypaeoniflorin, suffruticoside A, B, C, D and E.

It was a single-engined biplane that was designed and built to be the first aeroplane to cross the Atlantic Ocean non-stop. It took off on an attempt to cross the Atlantic from Newfoundland on 18 May 1919, but ditched during the flight owing to an overheating engine. Development and design In 1913, the British newspaper the Daily Mail offered a prize of ¬£10,000 for the first flight across the Atlantic.Flight 5 April 1913, p.393. Although plans were drawn up to attempt to win the prize, notably by Rodman Wanamaker, who ordered two Curtiss America flying boats, with John Cyril Porte selected to be the pilot, the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 put a stop to these plans. Following the Armistice on 11 November 1918, the competition was reopened,Flight 21 November 1918, p.1316. Thomas Sopwith, the head of the Sopwith Aviation Company decided to build an aircraft to compete for the prize.Robertson 1970, p.134. George Carter of Sopwith based his design for the transatlantic aircraft on the single-engined Sopwith B.1 bomber aircraft. It was a large, two-bay biplane powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle engine in a tractor configuration. It had a deeper fuselage than the B.1, housing a fuel tank carrying 330 imperial gallons (1,500 L) of petrol and with the crew of two sat well aft of the wings. The undercarriage mainwheels were jettisonable to reduce drag, while a boat was provided in case of emergency landing on the sea, being built into the fuselage decking behind the crew's cockpit. Operational history Another view of the aircraft, seen here with its engine cowling removed The transatlantic aircraft, named the Sopwith Atlantic was designed and built quickly, being completed early in 1919. Following testing at Brooklands airfield, the Atlantic was dismantled and dispatched to Newfoundland aboard ship, arriving on 28 March 1919. The aircraft was soon assembled, but weather was poor, with the chosen airstrip at St John's snowbound. Despite the fact that the competing Martinsyde aircraft had also arrived in Newfoundland, the crew of the Atlantic, Australian pilot Harry Hawker and navigator Kenneth Mackenzie Grieve could not attempt the Atlantic flight for several weeks.New York Times 13 April 1919.New York Times 19 May 1919. Hawker and Grieves finally took off from St John's on 18 May 1919. (other sources: from Mount Pearl) During the night, however, the aircraft's engine started to overheat, possibly because of a blocked filter in the cooling system. After making several attempts to clear the blockage by diving the aircraft and stopping and restarting the engine to attempt to cool it, with the engine still overheating and heavy weather ahead, they turned south to seek out the shipping lanes, and on encountering the Danish steamer SS Mary, ditched in the Atlantic and were rescued, 1130 mi 1,820 km) from St Mary's and 750 mi (1,210 km) from Ireland.Robertson 1970, p.135.Flight 29 May 1919, p.694. As the Mary was not fitted with radio, no news of Hawker and Grieves' rescue had reached the rest of the world, and they were feared to have been killed, a telegram of condolence being sent by King George V until the Mary reached Scotland on 25 May.Flight 29 May 1919, p.696.

Written by Oliver Drake, the film is about a cowboy who is robbed and then thrown from a train by an escaped murderer who then takes on the cowboy's identity. Plot Singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) is traveling to Mineral Springs Ranch to visit an old friend, Jefferson Lee (Carl Stockdale), whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years. On the train he is robbed and then thrown from the train by escaped murderer Wolf Benson (Boothe Howard). Believing Gene to be dead, Wolf plans to travel to Mineral Springs Ranch and pose as the radio celebrity in order to collect the $10,000 that Lee owes Gene. Meanwhile, Gene is rescued by traveling actors Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) and Professor Ezekial Daniels (Earle Hodgins). Together they travel to Sage City, where Gene gets into a fight with Sheriff Briggs (Walter James), who believes he is Wolf, and chokes the singing cowboy. Arrested for Wolf's crimes, Gene is unable to sing in order to prove his identity. At the trial, Gene mouths the words to his songs while a phonograph plays, and after the jury listens, Gene is set free. Wolf arrives at Lee's Mineral Springs Ranch pretending to be Gene and asks for his money back. Knowing he is an impostor, Lee refuses to give him the money and Wolf shoots him and robs his safe. On his way to Mineral Springs, Gene comes across a posted reward for \\"Gene Autry\\", the murderer of Jefferson Lee. Gene meets Lee's niece Mary Ann (Frances Grant), who is riding with Flash Baldwin (Donald Kirke), Wolf's accomplice. Gene notices that Baldwin is wearing his own suit, and decides to pose as Tex Smith, offering to perform at the Lee ranch in place of Gene Autry. After finding his suitcase in Baldwin's room, Gene overhears Wolf's scheme to rob the ranch safe, but Baldwin recognizes Gene's voice by playing his record while he sings. The next day, while the guests picnic, Wolf and his men crack the ranch safe. Gene pulls a gun on them, but Sheriff Briggs and his posse arrive with Frog and Daniels. He arrests Gene, instead of Wolf, still believing that Gene killed Lee. While the posse locates Mary Ann to implicate Wolf, he deserts his men and Gene overtakes him in his car. Mary Ann then testifies to Gene's innocence and they kiss.

Early life Dodge's paternal great great grandfather was David Low Dodge, a pacifist and founder of the New York Peace Society. His great grandfather was William E. Dodge, co-founder of Phelps Dodge & Co. His grandfather was Brigadier-General Charles Cleveland Dodge, who fought in the American Civil War. His parents, Charles Stuart Dodge and Flora Bigelow (daughter of John Bigelow) divorced in 1902. Flora, who had custody of their two children, John and his sister Lucie, remarried to Lionel George William Guest, a cousin of Winston Churchill, and moved to live in Montreal, Canada. His education included Fay School and St. Mark's School, Southborough, Massachusetts and then McGill University in Canada. First World War It was through Churchill, who then was First Lord of the Admiralty, that Dodge became commissioned into the Royal Naval Division, arriving in England in August 1914.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 57 He became a naturalised British Citizen in 1915. Dodge served in the 7th (Hood) Battalion of the Royal Naval Division first at Antwerp, then at Gallipoli. Together with Bernard Freyberg and two other officers, Dodge decided where Rupert Brooke was to be buried, and dug the grave on Skyros, immediately before the Gallipoli assault. While serving as a lieutenant he was wounded at Gallipoli, and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross during this campaign.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/11/07/101570677.pdf His award was published in the London Gazette on 8 November 1915. He transferred to the British Army in April 1916 with the rank of captain, to the 10th Battalion Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment (the recently raised 'Battersea Battalion), with whom he served on the Western Front, taking part in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. He was promoted to major on 22 February 1918, was wounded on more than one occasion, and ended the war as an acting lieutenant-colonel commanding the 16th Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment fighting in France. He was further decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, this being gazetted on 3 June 1919. He was demobilised on 18 December 1920, retaining the rank of major. Dodge's American cousin, Braxton Bigelow, had also joined the British army to fight in the First World War. He was killed in Flanders in 1917. Interwar years He made several expeditions through these years, including visits to China and Burma, however on a visit in 1921 to the Caucasus he was arrested by the Russian secret police as a suspected spy.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/12/28/98779032.pdf After about two months of dreadful discomfort and narrowly avoiding execution, he was expelled from Russia with an order never to return there again. After this he changed his political view from socialist to conservative. He served on London County Council as member for Mile End (East London) from 1925‚Äì31. He failed in his bids to get into Parliament for the Mile End parliamentary constituency in the 1924 and 1929 general elections. As part of his campaign for the London County Council election in 1926, Dodge engaged in a boxing exhibition match against a local professional and sustained a black eye. He became a member of the London Stock Exchange and took up the directorship of a New York bank. Johnnie married divorcee Minerva Sherman (n√©e Arrington) (1902‚Äì1980) in New York about 1929.

They had two sons, David born 1930 and Lionel (known as Tony) in 1934, both born in England. Second World War At the outbreak of the war, Dodge re-enlisted into the British Army, taking up the rank of major, serving with the Middlesex Regiment attached to the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. While awaiting action during the \\"Phoney War\\" stage, Johnnie secured adoption as prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for Gillingham for the next general election which was postponed by hostilities. When the division surrendered at Saint-Valery-en-Caux in June 1940, Dodge attempted to evade capture, and swam out to sea in an attempt to board some ships he could see on the horizon. However the ships moved off before he could reach them, so he returned to land, covering approximately seven miles, before coming ashore. He was then captured by the Germans and became a Prisoner of War. Prisoner of War Dodge, with many other POWs from the Allied defeat in France, was forced to march towards Germany. During the march his bare feet became badly cut, and eventually he was put on a barge with other Army prisoners for transport to Germany. While on the River Scheldt he jumped overboard, but was handed over to a Luftwaffe officer by a frightened Dutch civilian.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 58 As he had become a captive of the Luftwaffe, he, with all Air Force POWs, was sent to the Dulag Luft reception and transit camp at Oberursel. Dulag Luft At Dulag Luft he met the Senior British Officer, Wing Commander Harry Day, who with the agreement of the Camp Kommandant, Major Rumpel, was made part of the permanent British staff of the camp. Rumpel arranged for the records to show that he had been transferred to the Royal Air Force, and from then on, he remained with the RAF POWs. Escape always appealed to Dodge's mind, and here he was in good company. In addition to Day, also at the camp were the escape-obsessed Jimmy Buckley and Roger Bushell. It was from here that Dodge made his second escape attempt. A tunnel had been constructed by the permanent British staff, and in June 1941, Dodge, together with Day, Bushell and 14 others made their bid for freedom. None were successful, and all were recaptured. Dodge, and his travelling companion, were recaptured two days later walking along the autobahn a few miles south of Frankfurt. He was given a short period in solitary confinement before being transferred to Stalag Luft I at Barth, with all the other recaptured escapers.WO208/3269 ‚Äì Official Camp History ‚Äì Dulag Luft (Oberersul) page 18 Stalag Luft I Dodge became good friends with Harry Day who had taken over the role of Senior British Officer, and he helped Day with the running of the camp and with escape matters. He was transferred to Stalag Luft III at Sagan in April 1942. Stalag Luft III (East Compound) Here Dodge again acted as deputy to Day. In November 1942, he was transferred again, this time to Oflag XXI-B at Schubin in occupied Poland. En route to that camp, he escaped from the train, but was immediately seen, shot at and quickly recaptured.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 121The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill page 18 Oflag XXI-B Here Dodge escaped with 34 others (including Harry Day) through a tunnel on 5 March 1943.Stolen Journey by Oliver Philpot page 165Under the Wire by William Ash page 246 Again recaptured and after spending time in solitary, he was returned to Stalag Luft III in April 1943. Stalag Luft III (North Compound) Dodge became involved with the organisation of what became known as The Great Escape. Partly due to his large size, he did not help build the tunnels, but instead helped create diversions such as choir singing to help disguise the noise of the digging.The Great Escape by Tim Carroll page 107 Dodge was given a place in tunnel \\"Harry\\" and escaped at approximately 0100 on 25 March 1944 as part of The Great Escape. He travelled with Flight Lieutenant James Wernham RCAF towards Czechoslovakia. They were caught during the afternoon of the same day at Hirschberg main railway station.AIR40/2645 Official Camp History ‚Äì Stalag Luft III (Section III North Compound) Taken to the Kriminalpolizei at Hirschberg they met other recaptured escapers, including Bertram \\"Jimmy\\" James.Moonless Night by Bertram James page 107 Dodge was the first to be removed from Hirschberg, and was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was later joined by Jimmy James, Harry Day and Flight Lieutenant Sydney Dowse. James Wernham, together with 49 other recaptured escapers, was murdered under Hitler's orders. Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp The \\"Great Escapers\\" were placed in Sonderlager A (Special Camp A) within the main camp. Here were housed a handful of other 'political' prisoners, including SOE agent Peter Churchill, two Russian generals, various other Russians, Poles, Italians and four British soldiers of Irish origin.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 193 Later they were joined by British Commando Jack Churchill. Dowse and James almost immediately began another tunnel, which was kept secret from all non-British personnel. This was completed and used on the night of 23 September 1944, when Dodge, James, Day, Dowse and Jack Churchill escaped.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 210The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill page 236 Dodge, who travelled alone, was on the run for over a month, and after receiving help from some French slave labourers, was arrested by a German farmer and returned to Sachsenhausen. He, with the other four, who had also been recaptured, was placed in solitary confinement and chained to the floor in the death cells at the camp. Mainly through Harry Day's efforts all were spared execution. Peace envoy In February 1945, he was released from solitary and taken to Berlin, where he was asked by two senior German officials to act as a peace envoy to the British government with an offer of German surrender to the British and Americans but not to the Russians. Dodge was asked to undertake this task because of his relationship to Winston Churchill.The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill page 240-243 He returned to Britain, after traveling to Dresden, where he survived the RAF air raid on 14 February, then Munich before crossing the border into Switzerland. He arrived in Britain in May 1945 and met Churchill and the US ambassador to Britain, John Gilbert Winant on 6 May 1945. He explained his adventures and the German peace proposal.The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill page 243 History records the offer was not accepted. Later life Memorial for John Bigelow Dodge, St Andrew's church, Ferring, West Sussex, Southern England Dodge was awarded the Military Cross for his services as a POW, this being recorded in the London Gazette on 18 April 1946. Post-war Dodge was a central figure leading the war crimes investigation to bring key Gestapo and other officials to justice who were responsible for carrying out the orders to murder 50 of the 76 escapees from Stalag Luft III. He attempted to restart his political career, but with no success, when he stood at Gillingham at the 1945 General Election but lost narrowly to the winning Labour member, Joseph Binns. He died, aged 66, of a heart attack when hailing a taxi near Hyde Park in London in November 1960. After cremation his ashes were buried at St Andrew's Church, Ferring, Sussex. Legacy Dodge was portrayed by Christopher Reeve in the made-for-TV film The Great Escape II: The Untold Story (1988).

An Airy beam, is a propagation invariant wave whose main intensity lobe propagates along a curved parabolic trajectory while being resilient to perturbations (self-healing). Physical description A cross section of an ideal Airy beam would reveal an area of principal intensity, with a series of adjacent, less luminous areas trailing off to infinity. In reality, the beam is truncated so as to have a finite composition. As the beam propagates, it does not diffract, i.e., does not spread out. The Airy beam also has the characteristic of freely accelerating. As it propagates, it bends so as to form a parabolic arc. History The term \\"Airy beam\\" derives from the Airy integral, developed in the 1830s by Sir George Biddell Airy to explain optical caustics such as those appearing in a rainbow.\\"Scientists make first observation of Airy optical beams\\" The Airy waveform was first theorized in 1979 by M. V. Berry and N√°ndor L. Bal√°zs. They demonstrated a nonspreading Airy wave packet solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation. In 2007 researchers from the University of Central Florida (United States) were able to create and observe an Airy beam for the first time in both one- and two-dimensional configurations. The members of the team were Georgios Siviloglou, John Broky, Aristide Dogariu, and Demetrios Christodoulides. In one-dimension, the Airy beam is the only exactly shape-preserving accelerating solution to the free- particle Schr√∂dinger equation (or 2D paraxial wave equation). However, in two dimensions (or 3D paraxial systems), two separable solutions are possible: two-dimensional Airy beams and accelerating parabolic beams. Furthermore, it has been shown that any function on the real line can be mapped to an accelerating beam with a different transverse shape. In 2009 accelerating \\"Airy like\\" beams have been observed for the first time in non-linear systems by a joint team of Pavia University and L'Aquila University (Italy) and again they have been investigated in 2011 and 2012 mainly by the teams of University of Central Florida. Later, Airy beams have been demonstrated for other types of equations such as Helmholtz equation, Maxwell's equations. Acceleration can also take place along a radial instead of a cartesian coordinate, which is the case of circular-Airy abruptly autofocusing waves and their extension to arbitrary (nonparabolic) caustics. Acceleration is possible even for non- homogeneous periodic systems. With careful engineering of the input waveform, light can be made to accelerate along arbitrary trajectories in media that possess discrete or continuous periodicity. In 2018, researchers from Tel-Aviv university measured the cubic phase of Airy beams in an analogous system of surface gravity water-waves. They also managed to accelerate the Airy beam analog, using an external hydrodynamic linear potential and stop the self- accelerating front of the Airy beam. The members of the team associated with the experiment were Georgi Gary Rozenman, Ady Arie and Lev Shemer. Mathematical description The potential free Schr√∂dinger equation: ::i\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\xi} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\,s^2} = 0 Has the following Airy accelerating solution:\\"Observation of Accelerating Airy Beams\\" \\\\Phi(\\\\xi,\\\\,s) = \\\\mathrm{Ai}(\\\\,s - ( \\\\xi/2)^2 ) \\\\exp(i(\\\\,s\\\\xi/2) - i(\\\\xi^3/12)) where :* \\\\mathrm{Ai} is the Airy function. :* \\\\Phi is the electric field envelope :* s = x/x_0 represents a dimensionless traverse coordinate :* x_0 is an arbitrary traverse scale :* \\\\xi = z/kx_0^2 is a normalized propagation distance :* k = 2\\\\pi \\\\,n/\\\\lambda_0 This solution is non-diffracting in a parabolic accelerating frame. Actually one can perform a coordinate transformation and get an Airy equation. In the new coordinates the equation is solved by the Airy function. Experimental observation Georgios Sivilioglou, et al. successfully fabricated an Airy beam in 2007. A beam with a Gaussian distribution was modulated by a spatial light modulator to have an Airy distribution. The result was recorded by a CCD camera.  Modified Airy beams   Attenuation-compensation  Beams may encounter losses as they travel through materials which will cause attenuation of the beam intensity. A property common to non-diffracting (or propagation-invariant) beams, such as the Airy beam and Bessel beam, is the ability to control the longitudinal intensity envelope of the beam without significantly altering the other characteristics of the beam. This can be used to create Airy beams which grow in intensity at they travel and can be used to counteract losses, therefore maintaining a beam of constant intensity as it propagates. In temporal domain, an analogous modified dispersion-free attenuation-compensating Airy-based (\\"rocket\\") pulse was previously proposed and demonstrated in, designed to compensate media losses as it propagates through dispersive media. Applications  Optical trapping and manipulation  Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have used Airy beams to manipulate small particles, moving them along curves and around corners. This may find use in fields such as microfluidic engineering and cell biology.\\"Light throws a curve ball\\" (see also: Optical tweezers)  Imaging and microscopy  Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have further utilised Airy beams to make a large field of view (FOV) while maintaining high axial contrast in a light-sheet microscope. This technique has been adapted to use multi-photon excitation and attenuation-compensated Airy beams to achieve imaging at greater depths within biological specimens.  Micro-machining  The accelerating and diffraction-free features of the Airy wavepacket have also been utilized by researchers at the University of Crete to produce two-dimensional, circular- Airy waves, termed abruptly-autofocusing beams. These beams tend to focus in an abrupt fashion shortly before a target while maintaining a constant and low intensity profile along the propagated path and can be useful in laser microfabrication or medical laser treatments.

His involvement in the prediction, generation, and spectroscopy of circularly polarized luminescence from synthesized chiral phosphors have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in this relatively young sub-field of photophysical chemistry. Other contributions involve work in artificial photosynthesis and organic light emitting devices (see organic light-emitting diodes (OLED)). Contributions Circularly Polarized Luminescence Spectroscopy (CPL) Capable of measuring dissymmetry factors of even weakly luminescent materials to within a reported error as small as 10‚àí6, the home-built CPL spectrometer created and used by the Bernhard lab is more sensitive than any previously demonstrated CPL spectrometer. In addition, it was shown that CPL dissymmetry factors can be predicted computationally over a diverse sampling of known luminophore architectures, validating a new and facile tool for directing synthetic efforts in the search for anisotropic emitters. Artificial Photosynthesis Efforts in this field have focused on solution-based water photolysis. Breaking the problem into smaller components, the Bernhard lab has distinguished its efforts in photosensitization , water photoreduction catalysis , and water oxidation catalysis . These contributions consist primarily of advancement beyond prior art in catalyst longevity and electronic control. Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLEDs) The primary outcome of work in this field has been ionic transition metal complex devices with improved turn-on times, achieved by A) employing ionic liquids, or B) attaching cationic tails of varying lengths to the luminophores.

Puig Campana (, literally translated in English as Bell Peak) is a mountain forming part of the Prebaetic System in the southeast of Spain. With an altitude of , it is the second-highest peak in the province of Alicante. Puig Campana is located in the municipality of Finestrat only from the Mediterranean coast. From the base of the mountain it may seem that there is only one peak, but in fact there are two, the taller of which is not easily visible from the base of the mountain. The western of the two peaks has a pronounced crack or notch, historically this feature has been known colloquially as the El Portell (The Gate) although in recent times it has come to be known by a number of other names such as Roldan's Notch (Brecha or Tajo de Rold√°n in Spanish). A large part of the vegetation on the north eastern side of the mountain was burnt by a wildfire in 2009. The fire started on 24 January of that year when a high voltage electricity pylon was blown over by a strong wind. Some 1,000 hectares were reduced to ashes and around 15,000 people were evacuated from 25 urbanizations.14,000 evacuated as wild fire takes hold in Alicante province , typicallyspanish.com, 24 January 2009El alcalde de La Nuc√≠a destaca la 'tristeza' del municipio tras arder 1.006 hect√°reas, elmundo.es 25 January 2009 The best method for the reforestation of the mountain is currently being studied. Although five years after the disaster the area is still in a state of complete abandon. View of the forest fire that affected Puig Campana starting on 24 January 2009.  The Legend of Puig Campana  The notch that is present in the western peak of Puig Campana has given rise to a number of legends, or in reality to multiple versions of the same legend. One version of the legend is a version of the one that relates to La Br√®che de Roland, which is located in the Pyrenees. The local version says that the French hero Roland, commander of Charlemagne‚Äôs army, became embroiled in a sword fight with the head of the Moorish army and the duel finished on the top of the mountain. At one moment in the battle the Moorish leader was flung to the ground and Roland lifted his sword, Durandarte, in order to deal his enemy a final blow. However, he missed the prostrate figure and the force of the blow cut a chunk out of the mountain, which fell into the sea. This rock is still visible as Benidorm Island and the gash that Roland made in the peak of the mountain still bears his name. However, Professor B. Granier, Universit√© de Bretagne Occidentale (Brest, France), who did field work for his PhD thesis (1987)Granier B.

There are many versions of the legend, in another Roland's lover Alda was fated to die when the last of the sun's rays shone on her so Roldan cut out part of the mountain in order that the sun would take longer to set ensuring that Alda would live a few moments longer. Ascent The mountain may be ascended by a number of different paths, several of which converge before heading to the peak. Maps are available at the tourism office in downtown Finestrat, and there is also a small module at the trailhead at Font del Mol√≠ with some information. However, the trail, which in many places is hardly more than a narrow footpath, is badly marked, with small, faded painted symbols here and there on rocks along the way. In addition, the local landscape consists of steep slopes with much loose rock and tall scrub brush and trees, and as a result it is easy to get disoriented. Therefore, it is highly advisable to speak to the tourist office and/or the module first, and let them know you are going. Locals report that numerous tourists get lost and have to be rescued. Take water, food, and a mobile phone. There are no services along the way. From the trailhead, hike time to the summit is reported as from 5 to 8 hours round trip. Hike time on the circuit around the mountain's base without ascending to the summit is reported as from 4 to 5 hours. The most direct line of ascent is arguably from Finestrat, starting at Font del Mol√≠, heading towards the mountain's south face. From here, a long, steep, scree slope can be seen. It is possible (although unpleasant) to ascend the scree directly, or follow the trail which runs parallel to the scree slope on the right hand side. Both the trail and the scree slope are marked with fading red painted symbols. The trail is easy to lose in mist. From the top of the scree slope, the trail turns east towards the summit. There are many criss-crossing paths here, which makes the route difficult to follow in mist.

The first three cohomology groups were introduced by and are sometimes called Lichtenbaum‚ÄìSchlessinger functors T0, T1, T2, and the higher groups were defined independently by Michel Andr√© and by Daniel Quillen using methods of homotopy theory. It comes with a parallel homology theory called Andr√©‚ÄìQuillen homology. Motivation Let A be a commutative ring, B be an A-algebra, and M be a B-module. The Andr√©‚ÄìQuillen cohomology groups are the derived functors of the derivation functor DerA(B, M). Before the general definitions of Andr√© and Quillen, it was known for a long time that given morphisms of commutative rings and a C-module M, there is a three-term exact sequence of derivation modules: :0 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Der}_B(C, M) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Der}_A(C, M) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Der}_A(B, M). This term can be extended to a six-term exact sequence using the functor Exalcomm of extensions of commutative algebras and a nine-term exact sequence using the Lichtenbaum‚ÄìSchlessinger functors. Andr√©‚ÄìQuillen cohomology extends this exact sequence even further. In the zeroth degree, it is the module of derivations; in the first degree, it is Exalcomm; and in the second degree, it is the second degree Lichtenbaum‚ÄìSchlessinger functor. Definition Let B be an A-algebra, and let M be a B-module. Let P be a simplicial cofibrant A-algebra resolution of B. Andr√© notates the qth cohomology group of B over A with coefficients in M by , while Quillen notates the same group as .

It stars Roland Young and Lillian Gish. It had been filmed before in 1921 in the silent era as The Great Adventure with Lionel Barrymore, and was remade again in 1943 as Holy Matrimony with Monty Woolley. It is preserved at the Library of Congress, Washington D.C. and is available on DVD. This film is now entered in public domain (in the USA). Plot Priam Farrel (Roland Young) is England's greatest painter. A recluse who hates fame, he has been away from England and has never even seen his agent. When a woman mistakenly believes he has proposed marriage to her, he and his valet Henry Leek hastily return to England. After Leek dies soon after of pneumonia, the attending doctor mistakes him for Priam and informs the press. The real Priam is glad to be mistaken for his valet by everyone, even his cousin Duncan (who has not seen him since he was 12). After several attempts to clear up the misidentification, he gives up. He goes to a hotel, where he meets Alice Chalice (Lillian Gish), who was put in touch with Leek through a matrimonial agency and, by chance, was to meet Leek for the first time there. Leek had sent her a photograph of him and Priam together, so she makes the same mistake. Priam finds her very pleasant to be with. He has qualms when he learns that \\"he\\" is to be accorded the great honor of being interred in Westminster Abbey, but once again he is unable to convince anyone, including Alice, that he is the painter. He is happy to marry Alice and live a quiet country life. Then Alice's income from brewery shares disappears, along with the brewery, but Priam assures her that he can provide for her by selling some of his paintings. She is skeptical, however. Nonetheless, she sells some of his paintings, mainly for the frames. One painting passes through several hands and ends up with Oxford, Priam's old agent, who recognizes the artist's style. Oxford buys all of Priam's new paintings and resells them, guaranteeing that they are genuine Farrels. Oxford tracks Priam down and asks him to reveal he is still alive. It turns out that one of the paintings Oxford sold had a date on it, 1932, two years after Priam's \\"death\\", and the buyer has taken Oxford to court. Priam strenuously refuses, so Oxford takes another approach, placing an advertisement asking for information about Henry Leek. Leek's widow shows up, accompanied by her clergymen sons John and Henry. Her husband deserted her about 25 years before after the birth of their twin sons. She identifies Priam as him. Priam bolts at the first opportunity, but Alice is more than up to the challenge. She portrays her \\"Henry\\" as violent and not entirely sane and points out that there would be a scandal. The Leeks hastily depart. Even so, Priam is brought into court. In the course of testimony, his cousin Duncan recalls that he has two moles on his neck. Priam stubbornly refuses to show them, but Alice convinces him to do so. Afterward, Priam and Alice sail away to recover their privacy.

Life Barnabas entered the Irish House of Commons in 1613 as member for Coleraine. In 1634 he was returned for both Clare (as a colleague of his uncle, Daniel O'Brien, afterwards 1st Viscount Clare) and Carlow Borough but, being compelled to go to England for a time, new writs were issued for fresh elections. In 1639 Barnabas succeeded his brother Henry as sixth earl of Thomond, and applied for the governorship of Clare, which Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford refused him on the ground that his conduct differed entirely from that of his brother, and that he deserved nothing. Nevertheless, he was made Lord-lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum in 1640‚Äì41. When the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out he attempted to maintain neutrality, in spite of the support given by his kinsmen to the confederation, cites Carte, Ormonde, ii. 146 and did not sign the oath of association in 1641. Thomond lived quietly on his lands in Clare, and was in frequent communication with James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. In 1644 the council of the confederation forbade Thomond's agents to collect his rents, and even formed a scheme for seizing his chief stronghold at Bunratty, which his uncle, Sir Daniel O'Brien, was appointed to carry out. Thereupon Thomond, finding that no troops were forthcoming wherewith to defend Bunratty Castle, entered into negotiations with the parliamentarians, in spite of the remonstrances of Edward Somerset, Earl of Glamorgan. At the instigation of his kinsman, Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, he admitted a parliamentary garrison to the castle, and went to live in England. cites Bloody News from Ireland, 1646, pp. 4‚Äì5; Lodge, Desid. Cur. Hib. ii. 193‚Äì4, 322. Thomond soon joined King Charles I at Oxford, and received, on 3 May 1645, a patent creating him Marquis of Billing in Northamptonshire. cites Baker, Northamptonshire, i. 20‚Äì1. But the patent never passed under the great seal. A few years later Thomond petitioned parliament for the recovery of ¬£2,000 which had been seized in Bunratty, pleading that his real estate was in the hands of the Irish rebels, and that he had spent ¬£16,000 on the parliamentary cause. His petition was granted, and he apparently gave no cause for suspicion to the Commonwealth or protectorate, for his son Henry's request, on 15 December 1657, for the governorship of Thomond was favourably received by Henry Cromwell. cites Thurloe, vi. 681. Thomond died in November 1657, and his will, dated 1 July 1657, in which he left some bequests to Great Billing, was proved in England on 6 February, and in Ireland on 28 April in the same year. Pollard mentions that the authors of Lodge's Peerage (ed Archdall) maintained that Thomond was of strict loyalty, religion, and honour, and that his lands were taken from him during the rebellion through the unnatural conduct of his nearest relations; citing Lodge's Peerage (ed Archdall, ii. 37) it was also believed that he gave up Bunratty at Ormonde's instigation. cites Gilbert, Contemp. Hist, of Affairs in Ireland, i. 105‚Äì6. Family Barnabas was the second son of Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond, by his second wife, Elizabeth, fourth daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare. His elder brother, Henry O'Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond, who succeeded to the earldom on his father's death in 1624, was a strenuous adherent of the government in Ireland, was warmly commended by Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford for his loyalty, and died without male issue in 1639. Barnabas married Anne, youngest daughter of Sir George Fermor and divorced wife of Robert Crichton, 8th Lord Crichton of Sanquhar (who was hanged for murder in 1612). They whom he had one son, Henry O'Brien, 7th Earl of Thomond, his successor (1621‚Äì1691); and one daughter, Penelope, who married Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough.

The Court reflected the county's divided nature with one judge representing the then- rural eastern areas around the county seat of Independence, while the western judge represented the more urban areas closer to Kansas City. The presiding judge was elected countywide. Courthouses were built in both cities. The most famous presiding judge was Harry S. Truman (later the 33rd U.S. President) who represented the Eastern District before later winning election as presiding judge. The last presiding judge, George W. Lehr, later served as Missouri State Auditor from 1974 until 1977. *1827 - Richard Fristoe *1834 - Moses G. Wilson *1838 - John Davis (county executive) *1842 - James B.

From left to right: Humans, dogs, pigs, walking catfish, American crow, gravel ant. An omnivore () is an animal that has the ability to eat and survive on both plant and animal matter. Obtaining energy and nutrients from plant and animal matter, omnivores digest carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fiber, and metabolize the nutrients and energy of the sources absorbed. Often, they have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet. Omnivores come from diverse backgrounds that often independently evolved sophisticated consumption capabilities. For instance, dogs evolved from primarily carnivorous organisms (Carnivora) while pigs evolved from primarily herbivorous organisms (Artiodactyla). Despite this, physical characteristics such as tooth morphology may be reliable indicators of diet in mammals, with such morphological adaptation having been observed in bears. The variety of different animals that are classified as omnivores can be placed into further sub-categories depending on their feeding behaviors. Frugivores include maned wolves and orangutans; insectivores include swallows and pink fairy armadillos; granivores include large ground finches and mice. All of these animals are omnivores, yet still fall into special niches in terms of feeding behavior and preferred foods. Being omnivores gives these animals more food security in stressful times or makes possible living in less consistent environments. Etymology and definitions The word omnivore derives from the Latin omnis (all), and vora, from vorare, (to eat or devour), having been coined by the French and later adopted by the English in the 1800s. Traditionally the definition for omnivory was entirely behavioral by means of simply \\"including both animal and vegetable tissue in the diet.\\" In more recent times, with the advent of advanced technological capabilities in fields like gastroenterology, biologists have formulated a standardized variation of omnivore used for labeling a species' actual ability to obtain energy and nutrients from materials. This has subsequently conditioned two context specific definitions. * Behavioral: This definition is used to specify if a species or individual is actively consuming both plant and animal materials. (e.g. \\"vegans do not participate in the omnivore based diet.\\") * Physiological: This definition is often used in academia to specify species that have the capability to obtain energy and nutrients from both plant and animal matter. (e.g. \\"humans are omnivores due to their capability to obtain energy and nutrients from both plant and animal materials.\\") The taxonomic utility of omnivore's traditional and behavioral definition is limited, since the diet, behavior, and phylogeny of one omnivorous species might be very different from that of another: for instance, an omnivorous pig digging for roots and scavenging for fruit and carrion is taxonomically and ecologically quite distinct from an omnivorous chameleon that eats leaves and insects. The term \\"omnivory\\" is also not always comprehensive because it does not deal with mineral foods such as salt licks and the consumption of plant and animal material for medical purposes which would not otherwise be consumed (i.e. zoopharmacognosy) within non-omnivores. Classification, contradictions and difficulties Though Carnivora is a taxon for species classification, no such equivalent exists for omnivores, as omnivores are widespread across multiple taxonomic clades. The Carnivora order does not include all carnivorous species, and not all species within the Carnivora taxon are carnivorous. (The members of Carnivora are formally referred as carnivorans.) It is common to find physiological carnivores consuming materials from plants or physiological herbivores consuming material from animals, e.g. felines eating grass and deer eating birds. From a behavioral aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, this may be due to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For instance, it is well documented that animals such as giraffes, camels, and cattle will gnaw on bones, preferably dry bones, for particular minerals and nutrients. Felines, which are usually regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestibles (e.g. hair, bones), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative. Occasionally, it is found that animals historically classified as carnivorous may deliberately eat plant material. For example, in 2013, it was considered that American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) may be physiologically omnivorous once investigations had been conducted on why they occasionally eat fruits. It was suggested that alligators probably ate fruits both accidentally and deliberately. \\"Life-history omnivores\\" is a specialized classification given to organisms that change their eating habits during their life cycle. Some species, such as grazing waterfowl like geese, are known to eat mainly animal tissue at one stage of their lives, but plant matter at another.Maclean, Gordon Lindsay (1993). Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa. Publisher: New Holland. . The same is true for many insects, such as beetles in the family Meloidae,Skaife, S. H. (1953). African Insect Life. Pub. Longmans, Green & Co., London. which begin by eating animal tissue as larvae, but change to eating plant matter after they mature. Likewise, many mosquito species in early life eat plants or assorted detritus, but as they mature, males continue to eat plant matter and nectar whereas the females (such as those of Anopheles, Aedes and Culex) also eat blood to reproduce effectively. Omnivorous species General Although cases exist of herbivores eating meat and carnivores eating plant matter, the classification \\"omnivore\\" refers to the adaptation and main food source of the species in general, so these exceptions do not make either individual animals or the species as a whole omnivorous. For the concept of \\"omnivore\\" to be regarded as a scientific classification, some clear set of measurable and relevant criteria would need to be considered to differentiate between an \\"omnivore\\" and other categories, e.g. faunivore, folivore, and scavenger. Some researchers argue that evolution of any species from herbivory to carnivory or carnivory to herbivory would be rare except via an intermediate stage of omnivory. Omnivorous mammals Various mammals are omnivorous in the wild, such as species of pigs, badgers, bears, coatis, civets, hedgehogs, opossums, skunks, sloths, squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, mice, and rats. The hominidae, including humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans, are also omnivores. Most bear species are omnivores Most bear species are omnivores, but individual diets can range from almost exclusively herbivorous (hypocarnivore) to almost exclusively carnivorous (hypercarnivore), depending on what food sources are available locally and seasonally. Polar bears are classified as carnivores, both taxonomically (they are in the order Carnivora), and behaviorally (they subsist on a largely carnivorous diet). Depending on the species of bear, there is generally a preference for one class of food, as plants and animals are digested differently. Wolf subspecies (including wolves, dogs, dingoes, and coyotes) eat some plant matter, but they have a general preference and are evolutionarily geared towards meat. Also, the maned wolf is a canid whose diet is naturally 50% plant matter. While most mammals may display \\"omnivorous\\" behavior patterns depending on conditions of supply, culture, season and so on, they will generally prefer a particular class of food, to which their digestive processes are adapted. Like most arboreal species, most squirrels are primarily granivores, subsisting on nuts and seeds.Halle, S. & Stenseth, N. (2000). Activity patterns in small mammals: an ecological approach. Berlin; Heidelberg, Germany; New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 131. But like virtually all mammals, squirrels avidly consume some animal food when it becomes available. For example, the American eastern gray squirrel has been introduced by humans to parts of Britain, continental Europe and South Africa. Where it flourishes, its effect on populations of nesting birds is often serious, largely because of consumption of eggs and nestlings.Moller, H. (1983). \\"Food and foraging behaviour of red (Scirus vulgaris) and grey (Scirus carolinensis) squirrels\\". Mammal Review 13: 81-98. Other species Various birds are omnivorous, with diets varying from berries and nectar to insects, worms, fish, and small rodents. Examples include cassowaries, chickens, crows and related corvids, kea, rallidae, and rheas. In addition, some lizards, turtles, fish (such as piranhas and catfish), and invertebrates are also omnivorous. Quite often, mainly herbivorous creatures will eagerly eat small quantities of animal food when it becomes available. Although this is trivial most of the time, omnivorous or herbivorous birds, such as sparrows, often will feed their chicks insects while food is most needed for growth.Capinera, John (2010). Insects and Wildlife. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell. . On close inspection it appears that nectar-feeding birds such as sunbirds rely on the ants and other insects that they find in flowers, not for a richer supply of protein, but for essential nutrients such as cobalt/vitamin b12 that are absent from nectar. Similarly, monkeys of many species eat maggoty fruit, sometimes in clear preference to sound fruit.Ewing, Jack (2005). Monkeys Are Made of Chocolate. Publisher: Pixyjack Press. . When to refer to such animals as omnivorous, or otherwise, is a question of context and emphasis, rather than of definition.

In 1907 he was nominated for the North Island team but did not play after he, along with eleven other Auckland nominations, refused to sign a declaration that he would remain an amateur player. Rugby League Wynyard was then selected to be part of the professional All Blacks 1907-08 tour of Australia and Great Britain alongside his brother Billy. Wynyard had to resign his government job to be part of the tour, but the move paid off as he ended up playing in all eight test matches. Out of the 49 tour matches Richard played in 44 of them, more than any other player. He scored 28 tries and kicked a goal and a field goal. Unlike many of the touring party he remained in New Zealand after the tour, captaining Auckland in the first ever provincial match against Wellington on 24 August 1908. He, along with his brother, later helped form the North Shore Albions Rugby League Club - which broke away from the North Shore Rugby Club. Death He committed suicide in 1915 in Auckland by cutting his throat; he was despondent as he had been unable to find work as a clerk, and the coroner‚Äôs verdict was temporary insanity.

Background He was the brother of Richard Wynyard. He was born and died in Auckland. Early years Wynyard was from a sporting family that included three uncles that were part of the 1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Native football team that conducted a rugby union tour of Great Britain. One of these three, Tabby Wynyard, went on to represent New Zealand on their 1893 tour of Australia. Richard followed the family tradition, becoming a noted rugby player and a civil servant clerk by trade.John Haynes From All Blacks to All Golds: Rugby League's Pioneers, Christchurch, Ryan and Haynes, 1996. Rugby football career Living in Devonport, Wynyard was part of the North Shore Rugby Club. He went in the 10th New Zealand contingent to the Boer War, and played rugby there. He won Auckland selection later than his brother Richard did, but by 1907 was firmly established in the Auckland side. Rugby league career Wynyard was selected to be part of the professional All Blacks 1907‚Äì08 tour of Australia and Great Britain. He was one of the last two players selected, along with Charlie Dunning, and joined the squad late during the first Australian leg of the tour. Wynyard became a valuable member of the squad, scoring six tries, however injury meant he had to wait until the squad returned to Australia to make his test debut, playing in the first ever trans- Tasman test which was the debut match of the Australia national rugby league team. He played in two of the test matches against Australia. Unlike many of the touring party Wynyard opted not to return to a professional contract in Britain and instead stayed in New Zealand to help establish rugby league. He, along with his brother, helped found the North Shore Albions Rugby League Club ‚Äì which broke away from the North Shore Rugby Club. He largely acted as a coach and selector for the North Shore club though he did come out of retirement to play a match for them in Round 7 of the 1913 season and scored a try in a 10-7 win. Later years When the New Zealand Rugby League was formed on 25 April 1910 Wynyard was elected to the New Zealand Council. He served as a New Zealand selector between 1910 and 1919.Coffey, John and Bernie Wood Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909‚Äì2009, 2009. , p.24. He was also an active member of the North Shore Rowing Club and was a founder of the Devonport Orphans' Club. For 34 years he was connected with the firm of P/ Hayman and Sons, Ltd.

On the night of his death, he was stopped by police in Wimbledon for erratic driving, and fled across rail- tracks at Wimbledon Park station where he was electrocuted and then hit by a train. The son of former England batsman Matthew Maynard, he was regarded as a highly promising young player.  Life and career  Born in Cardiff, Maynard attended Pentyrch Primary School, Radyr Comprehensive School, and then moved to Millfield School before attending Whitchurch High School for sixth form. Maynard made his way up the ranks with Glamorgan, starting in the county's Under-17s side at the age of 15. By the time he was 16, he had reached the Glamorgan 2nd XI and was playing for the Wales Minor Counties team. Maynard made his debut for the Glamorgan First XI on 10 June 2007, playing in a Friends Provident Trophy match against the Gloucestershire Gladiators at Colwyn Bay. He hit 71 runs off 75 balls, including seven fours and three sixes before being caught and bowled by Mark Hardinges. After batting second, Glamorgan lost by six runs. Maynard's Twenty20 Cup debut soon followed, as he played in Glamorgan's three-run defeat to the Warwickshire Bears on 24 June 2007; he scored 11 runs before being caught by Tim Ambrose off the bowling of Heath Streak. His first-class debut finally came two months later on the third day of a County Championship match against Somerset. No play was possible on the first two days of the match, so Maynard's debut ended up being restricted to just one innings, in which he scored 15 runs before being caught by Craig Kieswetter off Steffan Jones. He also bowled two overs in the Somerset innings, conceding 18 runs. After his debut, Maynard's seasonal first-class batting average increased from 11.66 to 22.60, with an overall average of 15.33 and a top score of 51 not out. His Twenty20 average has also increased from 8.66 to 14.57, with an overall average of 12.45, but his List A average remained fairly constant at around 35, except for a drop to around 21.5 in 2008.

In 2012 he continued to perform well for Surrey. He scored 635 runs in eight first-class matches, averaging 45.35, and achieved his career best score of 143. In five List A matches he averaged 39.33. The day before his death, Maynard hit 7 runs off 17 balls against Kent Spitfires in the Friends Life t20 at Beckenham, his only appearance in the competition in the 2012 season. Death Maynard's car, a Mercedes-Benz C250, was stopped by police in Arthur Road, Wimbledon, in south west London at around 4 am BST on 18 June 2012, when they observed it being driven erratically. Maynard subsequently fled the scene on foot and the police were unable to locate him. Approximately one hour later, Maynard was severely electrocuted on a railway line near Wimbledon Park Station. He was then hit by a London Underground District line train and his body was found near to the tracks at 5:10 am. According to British Transport Police, his death was treated by authorities as \\"non-suspicious\\". His funeral was held at Llandaff Cathedral on 4 July, with more than 1,000 people in attendance, including England players past and present. Hugh Morris, the England team's managing director, said in his tribute that Maynard was \\"one of our most exciting and explosive young batsmen. A player who could make the game look deceptively easy, a player who was surely destined for the highest honours of the game, and a player whose authority and elegance at the crease reminded so many of his father.\\" Mark Wallace, the current Glamorgan captain, said that he had \\"an insatiable appetite for life\\" and that he could be \\"a larrikin and a maverick at times\\". He also said that he would always remember him as \\"the lad who made us laugh more than anyone else I‚Äôve met\\".\\"Cricket family bares its heart in farewell to Maynard\\" by Scyld Berry Daily Telegraph, pages S10-S11, published 5 July 2012, retrieved 6 July 2012 An official inquest into Maynard's death was held at Westminster Coroner's Court on 26 February 2013. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death. Those who gave evidence included his Surrey teammates Jade Dernbach and Rory Hamilton-Brown, who had been with him earlier in the evening of his death. The post-mortem revealed that Maynard was nearly four times over the legal drink-drive limit and had also taken cocaine and ecstasy in the form of MDMA. A forensic pathologist said that it was not possible to say whether electrocution or being hit by the train was the ultimate cause of death. Legacy A charity, the Tom Maynard Trust, was launched in his memory at the CB40 fixture between Surrey and Glamorgan at The Oval on 21 August, to help young cricketers and other young sportspeople in developing their careers. The match also served as a memorial to Maynard, with all the players on both sides wearing shirts that carried Maynard's squad numbers when at Glamorgan and Surrey, 33 and 55 respectively. Both squad numbers were retired, as was the number 64 he wore on duty for the England Lions.Sequence and Squad Numbers - England Men. Retrieved 12 January 2015.

The efforts of Shri Easwara Iyer, Shri Kuppayandi Pillai and Shri Subramaniya Kandar ensured that the bridge across the Cauvery River got located at Velur. The bridge was opened for traffic in 1952 by Sri Rajagopalachari (former Governor General of India) in the presence of Sri Bhakthavthsalam, who was Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu during that period. Now another bridge was also constructed adjacent to the old one, The longest road in INDIA is NH-7 which also passes through paramathi velur. paramathi is mainly known for paramathi fort. Fort was very ancient and traditional indication. The only fort builded by tamilans without rocks . That was builded by allala ilayan belongs to vettuva gounder community. Inside the fort there is an temple for the guardian of the fort called kotaiyanna swamy. The town consists of mainly irrigated fields. Agriculture is the major occupation of the people. Paddy, sugarcane, banana, coconut trees, turmeric and the Beetle Vine plantation are major crops cultivated.A Village called Pillikalpalayam which has Tamil Nadu's Second largest Jaggery(Vellam,Sweet prepared from sugarcane juice) Gudown. The town is known for its Karpoora Pan leaf, which is exported to major states in North India. A special fluffy bread called Bun Parotta is one of the most relished food served in the hotels of this area. Non-vegetarians would love to try the special duck curry, which is known for its flavor and taste, and is mostly served in the hotels of this area. The Velur town is adorned with a few ancient temples such as the Kasi Viswanathar Temple, Mariaman Temples, Bhagavathi amman temple, Pancha Mugha Vinayagar (5 faced vinayagar) temple and few more. The temple festivals are celebrated with vigor. The ceremonies are spread over a fortnight that always ends with a massive dose of feasting and Keda Vettu. Nanjai Edaiyar Mariamman Temple is one of the temples, it situated 3 km east from the town. Kabilar Malai Thandayuthapani Swamy Temple is another one, here Thai Poosam festival is conducted very grandly; on that day a lot of Kavadis were taken around the taluk. It is situated 8 km west from the town. Priyathankara Devi Temple and various temples are located here. Adi 18th, is celebrated at the Cauvery river bank with the release of Agal vilakku into the river. This event is watched over by a lot of people at sunset on Adi 18th.

This Institutions have been providing valuable education to the students in the around districts. Lord Anjaneyar Temple Namakkal is known for a more than life-size Hanuman (Anjaneynar) Statue carved out of a single stone. The city lies at the foot of a huge rock, upon which there is a fort. The name Namakkal immediately brings to mind ‚ÄòNamakkal Anjaneyar‚Äô ‚Äì the temple of Hanuman at Namakkal. The idol of Hanuman is approximately 18 feet in height, and stands under open sky. Opposite to the Hanuman is a temple of Narasimha. Namagiri Lakshmi Narasimhaswami Temple The principal deity worshiped here is a carved Trimurti of Lord Vishnu in the form of Sri Narasimha Swami. The murti and the ancient cave temple are carved out of an imposing hill. There is a separate shrine for Goddess Namagiri Lakshmi. The Kolli Hills are featured in several works of classical Tamil literature such as Silappathigaram, Manimekalai, Purananuru and Ainkurnuru. The region was ruled by Valvil Ori around 200 AD, who is praised as one of the seven great philanthropists of ancient Tamil Nadu. His valor and marksmanship are sung by several poets, and his exploits are a popular part of folklore. Ori is said to have killed a lion, bear, deer and a boar with a single arrow. The jackfruit grown on these mountains is known for its taste and fragrance and is often soaked in wild honey that is also harvested from these mountains. The mountains are covered by lush green vegetation in the spring and monsoon, and are streaked with streams. There are three reserved forests that are controlled by the Government of Tamil Nadu, namely Ariyur Solai, Kundur Nadu, Pulianjolai It is not correct to regard the name Kolli Hills as being due to the incidence of deadly diseases such as malaria! It is because early literature records the existence of an image called kollippavai on top of these hills. This image was believed to represent the spirit of a maiden who lured wayfarers by her beauty and then killed them. The mountain is a site of pilgrimage, because of the Arapaleeswarar Temple, which is believed to have a secret path to the Shiva temple in Rasipuram. This Shiva temple is said to have been built by Valvil Ori in the 1st or 2nd century when he ruled this area. \\"Arappaleeswara sathakam\\" is the poem which praises the Lord Arappaleeswarar. It is believed that this temple existed during the Sangam period itself. Tourism: Kolli Hills has to be explored in a leisure space.

Reported in the 1915 issue of Monthly Weather Review A whole sky camera is a specialized camera used in meteorology and astronomy for capturing a photograph of the entire sky. Another application is that of hemispherical photography to study plant canopy geometry and to calculate near-ground solar radiation. Development Whole sky cameras typically use a fisheye lens that takes in an extremely wide, hemispherical image. Such lenses were originally developed for use in meteorology. However, alternative techniques are based on the photography of mirror-like a hemisphere which are more common. One of the first reported whole sky cameras was based on a series of pictures with lenses inclined to the horizon at an altitude of 45 degrees. With a lens that covers an angular field of 90 degrees, such camera revolves about a vertical axis. Meteorological applications In meteorological applications, whole sky cameras are used to study cloud cover, the current level of UV radiation, fractional cloud coverage, sky polarization, the computation of cloud base height and wind speed at cloud heights. Other uses include creating time-lapse photography of clouds. Whole sky cameras may be equipped with a sun tracking device to block sunlight which is too bright for the typical dynamic range of photographs. Sun tracking allows for reliable estimates of cloud fractional coverage, including cover in the part of the sky close to the Sun. There are techniques such as HDR which permit the taking of high dynamic range photographs without a sun tracker. Cloud stereoscopy Whole sky cameras in stereo configurationsKassianov, E., C.N.

Plot Dynamite fishing in a rural swamp revives a prehistoric gill monster that lives on the blood of human females. When a local is fishing with dynamite in Bog Lake, something larger pops to the surface: a green bug-eyed monster awakened from a long sleep, which promptly begins killing fishermen who stumble across its lair. When biologist Ginny Glenn (Gloria DeHaven) discovers the creature's evolutionary nature, the local sheriff decides to use various methods to destroy the beast. Eventually the monster is killed after it is rammed with a truck, but its eggs remain.

The married coupe perform a brand of electronic music that combines elements of Arabic, North African, and Asian musical styles fused with American avant-garde dance pop. They released two EPs on Manimal Vinyl records since forming in early 2008: The Basta (2008) and Kabukimono (2009). They have also released the full-length album Boys and Diamonds (2011) on the Kompakt label. Rainbow Arabia have toured the US with bands like Gang Gang Dance and Julian Casablancas and played shows in Europe with Wavves and Mogwai. They cite the label Sublime Frequencies and Syrian singer Omar Souleyman as influences. Their Kabukimono EP found critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2011, Rainbow Arabia shifted their focus towards into more cosmic territory aligning with the venerable Kompakt Records who released their first full-length album Boys And Diamonds. In 2013, Rainbow Arabia return with their 2nd LP, FM Sushi, further expanding their cosmic sound by adding multi-instrumentalist Dylan Ryan (Icy Demons, Sand) into the mix. Rainbow Arabia continue creating songs that are hard to describe but easy to love. In FM Sushi, they take a decidedly different direction for the group stripping away much of the tropical rhythms in favor exploring a more pulsing, immersive sound that combines krautrock's rolling synthscapes with their signature mercurial pop. The newest album, L.A. Heartbreak, is out Nov 11, 2016 on the Time No Place Label. This album is dreamy, melodic pop that takes cues from Tangerine Dream, OMD, Moroder and Jan Hammer - confidently painting with bolder strokes with leaner, brighter production and infectious hooks evoking 80s radio pop that skew more towards Madonna and Cyndi Lauper rather than darker post-punk influences referenced on Rainbow Arabia's earlier albums.

A few different designs have been proposed, but all rely on the idea of reducing the required switching fields by heating. The first design's cell, which was proposed by James M. Daughton and co-workers, had a heating element, an MRAM bit, an orthogonal digit line, and used a low-Curie point ferromagnetic material as the storage layer. In a second and more-promising design, which was developed by the Spintec Laboratory (France) and subsequently licensed to Crocus Technology, the storage layer is made of a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic layer. When the cell is heated by flowing a heating current through the junction and the temperature exceeds the \\"blocking temperature\\" (Tb), the ferromagnetic layer is freed, and the data is written by application of a magnetic field while cooling down. When idle, the cell's temperature is below the blocking temperature and much more stable. This approach offers multiple advantages over previous MRAM technologies: # Because the write selection is temperature-driven, it eliminates write- selectivity problems; # It is a low-power approach as only one magnetic field is required to write, and because the cell stability and magnetic susceptibility are decoupled as a result of the introduction of the blocking temperature; and # It is thermally stable due to the exchange bias of the storage layer.

The reverse commemorates both Trajan's natural father and Ulpia's brother, Marcus Ulpius Traianus (right), and his adoptive father, the Deified Nerva (left). Ulpia (about 31 - before 86) was a noble Spanish Roman woman from the gens Ulpia during the 1st century CE. Life Her mother is unknown and her paternal ancestors moved from Italy and settled in Italica (near modern Seville, Spain) in the Roman Province of Hispania Baetica in the late 3rd century BC. Her brother was Marcus Ulpius Traianus, who served as a distinguished Roman general and was the first person in her family to enter the Roman Senate. He was the biological father of Trajan, adopted son and heir of the deified Nerva. Ulpia married a Roman Senator called Publius Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus, a wealthy and aristocratic Hispanic Roman from the gens Aelia. Ulpia and Marullinus had at least a son, Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer, who would become a distinct Roman soldier and politician. He married a noble Spanish Roman woman called Domitia Paulina and the couple had Aelia Domitia Paulina and Publius Aelius Hadrianus or Hadrian, who was adopted by Trajan and became his heir. Through Ulpia's brother, she was the paternal aunt to Ulpia Marciana and Trajan. She was also a great maternal aunt to Marciana's daughter Salonina Matidia and a great-great maternal aunt to Roman Empress Vibia Sabina, who married his grandson Hadrian.

The HWF name celebrates the Hawaiian way by which Aloha is shared, the Hawaiian way by which the lives of others are enhanced, and the Hawaiian way of finding solutions within the community. The name represents and honors the Indigenous culture of the Hawaiian Islands. The purpose of the HWF is to enhance the well-being of Hawaii through community-based initiatives founded on Hawaiian culture, knowledge, and traditions. It is a unique cultural and community development fund that connects everyday individuals to the power of Hawaiian culture. The overall goals of the HWF are: * To invest in Native Hawaiian community organizations * To decrease fundraising expenses for all involved * To increase direct impact of gifts * To support multiple small nonprofits * To provide accountability to donors, recipients, and the community History The HWF was founded by CNHA in 2004, with seed funding and support from CNHA and two corporations. In the beginning, a roundtable of more than 30 community organizations provided guidance for the Fund. In September 2004, nine (9) Partner Recipients working in communities and with Hawaii residents across the state were awarded Fund dollars. Since then, HWF has continued to grow, and support programs dedicated to community development, enhancing best practices, and increasing the skills of community organizations. As of July 2009, HWF supports over thirty (30) Partner Recipients. In addition to providing direct funding to Hawaiian organizations, the HWF also sponsors specific programs and events, such as, conventions and grants forums. Giving approach The HWF has a deliberate focus to benefit small, grassroots organizations maintaining important cultural and community service programs. The Fund aims to practice a distinctly Hawaiian way of giving ‚Äì one that does not necessarily look for the longest track record or the most ambitious plan, but instead recognizes the importance of contributions that place a priority on culture and community. Recipients of Hawaiian Way Fund dollars have been members of CNHA for at least two (2) years. The list of Partner Recipients currently consists of Native Hawaiian non-profits delivering an array of community development programs and services, ranging from halau hula to language, environment to education, and housing to economic development, all tied to a common mission of community well-being. Each organization applies for designation as a Partner Recipient of the Hawaiian Way Fund and must meet programming criteria. At this time, the Fund receives dollars through two (2) sources of revenue: individual contributions or gifts, and payroll deductions. Individual contributions can be made as a ‚Äúone-time‚Äù donation by cash, check, or credit card. Payroll deductions are facilitated through the use of Employer Partners. Through Employer Partners, employees of partnering organizations have the opportunity to make a predetermined payroll deduction with varying frequency. The HWF is also eligible to receive designated gifts through the Aloha United Way and the Combined Federal Campaign. Accountability As a community development and cultural Fund, the HWF ensures that the donor gifts directly touch Hawaiian communities. To ensure maximum impact of these gifts, CNHA dedicates its most senior officers to the administration of the Fund at no salary cost to the Fund itself. The HWF has an Advisory Committee that is appointed by the CNHA Board of Directors and/or its Executive Committee. The Advisory Committee convenes throughout the year to oversee fiscal accountability, fundraising activities, and eligibility of Partner Recipients. They represent the best in their respective fields and bring important perspectives and energy to the Fund. The HWF is subject to CNHA‚Äôs annual audit by an independent accounting firm located in Honolulu, Hawaii. With oversight by an Advisory Committee and CNHA‚Äôs 15- member Board of Directors, the HWF presents a credible fund that values accountability and transparent reporting.

He was later hired as a photojournalist for KOGO in 1963 which became KGTV, the ABC affiliate television station in San Diego. During his 38 years at KGTV, Lampert covered a variety of assignments; his favorite involved law enforcement. A well known fixture to local, state, and federal law enforcement officials, his ability to learn about highly sensitive undercover operations then stay out of law enforcement‚Äôs way while still getting video footage of the story was remarkable. His sensitivity to not identifying undercover agents made for a positive relationship. In 1963 he became a San Diego Police Reserve Officer and served until 1972. During those years, Lampert received numerous commendations from the department, including the Moral Fiber Award from Kiwanis for assisting in Saving the life of a courtroom watcher, when he put down his camera and helped apply artificial resuscitation reviving a comatose male. He was also involved with two shooting incidents, in one of which he shot a rifle-wielding suspect in Mountain View Park while other officers were under fire.

A frequent San Diego Police Academy guest speaker on news/police relations, Lampert also gave lessons to law enforcement regarding camera equipment capabilities and lighting techniques during undercover operations. Upon retiring, Lampert received awards from the FBI and United States Marshal‚Äôs Service. The County of San Diego further honored him by proclaiming March 9, 2001, the day of his retirement, Bob Lampert Day. It was no surprise that on May 15, 2008, the San Diego Police Historical Association presented Lampert with the Legends Behind the Badge Jose A. Cota Award. Bob Lampert is married to Alicia (Daly) Lampert the first uniformed female police officer for the San Diego Police department to work a patrol car alone in the field. Lampert continues to share with his community his knowledge of photography, and is the contributing photographer for author Aaron Elkins and Charlotte Elkinshttp://www.bookshttpnbytes.com/authors/elkins_charlotte.html author of the novels about a fictional golfer, Lee Ofsted. Lampert is also a member of the National Press Photographers Association and the Leica Historical Society of America.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 16, 2011 is a major tributary of the Tujunga Wash, itself a tributary of the Los Angeles River, in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles County, California. The stream begins at Mount Gleason, , in the western San Gabriel Mountains of the Angeles National Forest. The upper reaches, sometimes known as Pacoima Creek, flow through Pacoima Canyon as a rapid mountain stream. It then reaches the Pacoima Dam Reservoir in the western San Gabriel Mountains of the Angeles National Forest and proceeds south in a free-flowing stream alongside Pacoima Trail Road. Below the dam, it is generally known as the Pacoima Wash. From there, it joins several other unnamed streams that drain the nearby mountains, collecting at Lopez Dam. South of that dam, Pacoima Wash is encased in a concrete flood control channel, and travels south from Kagel Canyon in Sylmar though San Fernando, Pacoima, Mission Hills, Panorama City, and Van Nuys. Just after Interstate 5, the stream branches off to the Pacoima Diversion Channel, joining Tujunga Wash further upstream. Just before Raymer Street, the stream also branches off to an unnamed channel joining Tujunga Wash. The main Pacoima Wash continues to Van Nuys Boulevard and is carried through a storm drain to join Tujunga Wash further south. Recent history In 1991, the section between Lassen Street and Parthenia Street was one of the last sections of natural stream beds in the San Fernando Valley to be made a concrete channel. In 2007, the wash was cleaned up after being cited as a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus. Pacoima Wash has been the site of several rescues of people, mostly of children and teenagers trapped in the spring runoff. Recent stories have appeared in 1985, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, and 2006. In recent years there have been efforts to create a greenway along the Wash connecting the communities of the Northeast San Fernando Valley. In 2004 the Pacoima Wash Greenway Master Plan was created by Department of Landscape Architecture at Cal Poly Pomona which focuses on the portion of the Wash within the City of San Fernando.ftp://ftp.dpla.water.ca.gov/users/prop50/10040_LosAngeles/Attachment%208/8.%20Pacoima%20Wash%20Greenway%20-%208th%20Street%20PRoject/8-1%20Pacoima%20Wash%20Greenway%20Master%20Plan.pdf In 2008 environmental non-profit Pacoima Beautiful started the Pacoima Wash initiative.http://www.pacoimabeautiful.org/community-planning/pacoima-wash/ The goal of this project is to create a linear greenway composed of bike lanes and a walking path along a 12-mile stretch of the Wash between the Pacoima Dam in Sylmar and the Tujunga Wash in Arleta. The Pacoima Wash Vision Plan,http://www.pacoimabeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Pacoima-Wash- Vision-Plan-Book_FINAL.pdf which covers the Sylmar and Pacoima portions of the Wash was produced in 2011. An addendum to the plan focusing on the Arleta portion of the Wash is currently being produced. Several new parks along the Wash are in various stages of completion. 8th Street Park is a 4.75 acre park in the City of San Fernando which will be completed in spring of 2014.http://zev.lacounty.gov/communities/valley/opening-the-door-to-a-greener- future The city of Los Angeles is creating preliminary designs for a park along the Wash between El Dorado and Telfair Street.http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/795/files/pacoima%20wash%20-%20linking%20urban%20communities%20to%20the%20mountains.pdf Crossings and tributaries From mouth to source (year built in parentheses): *Van Nuys Boulevard (1948) *Saticoy Street (1933) *Raymer Street *Railroad: Union Pacific Coast Line *Unnamed channel departs *Roscoe Boulevard (1957) *Chase Street [Pedestrian Bridge] *Parthenia Street *Rayen Street (1996) *Nordhoff Street *Tupper Street [Pedestrian Bridge] *Plummer Street *Lassen Street *Parking lot *Woodman Avenue *Devonshire Street and Pacoima Spreading Grounds *Arleta Avenue *Pacoima Diversion Channel departs *Interstate 5 Golden State Freeway and Paxton Street ramps (1963 and 1976) *Laurel Canyon Boulevard (1954) *State Route 118 Ronald Reagan Freeway (1969) *San Jose Street/Haddon Avenue [Pedestrian Bridge] *San Fernando Road (1925) *Railroad: Metrolink Antelope Valley Line *Bradley Avenue/4th Street (1954) *5th Street (1953) *Glenoaks Boulevard (1953) *Foothill Boulevard (1923) *Interstate 210 Foothill Freeway (1975) *Lopez Dam *Harding Street *Gavina Avenue *Pacoima Trail Road and private roads References External links * City of San Fernando: Pacoima Wash Project * Pacoima Beautiful.org: Pacoima Wash Vision Plan Initiative Category:Rivers of Los Angeles County, California Category:Tributaries of the Los Angeles River Category:Washes of California Category:San Gabriel Mountains Category:Geography of the San Fernando Valley Category:Mission Hills, Los Angeles Category:Pacoima, Los Angeles Category:Panorama City, Los Angeles Category:San Fernando, California Category:Sylmar, Los Angeles Category:Van Nuys, Los Angeles Category:Rivers of Southern California ","title":"Pacoima Wash"},{"id":"23975204","text":"Baby Face Morgan is a 1942 American comedy of errors crime film directed by Arthur Dreifuss. It stars Mary Carlisle and Richard Cromwell. The film was a notable \\"B\\" effort for PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation). Jack Schwarz was producer, and Leon Fromkess was listed as \\"in charge of production\\". Plot With America engaged in fighting World War II, the traditional gangsters have fallen on tough times. 'Doc' Rogers (Robert Armstrong) summons criminals from around the nation for a summit. He proposes that the only way they can regain their former wealth and influence is by uniting under a strong leader. As the now deceased Mob Boss \\"Big Morgan\\" was their greatest leader, Rogers, his lieutenant, decides to bring in Morgan's son Edward 'Baby Face' Morgan (Richard Cromwell) to lead the gangsters. Rogers sends two of his loyal but dim-witted henchmen to see whether Edward has the capabilities of his father, and if he does, to bring him back. Edward, who never knew his father or the life he led, is a small-town delivery boy. The two henchmen misinterpret his account of taking collections and leaving pineapples as proof he uses hand grenades to support his extortion racket and brings him back to Doc. Doc immediately sees that Edward and his cousin Ollie (Chick Chandler) are naive youngsters but decides to use Edward's name as a unifying element. However, Doc ensures that the gangsters never meet Edward nor does Edward meet the criminals or know what business they are in. Doc sets Edward and Ollie up as President and Vice President of one of Big Morgan's shelf corporations called the Acme Protection Agency where the profits of the criminals' extortion rackets are deposited. Edward and Ollie believe they are running an insurance company staffed with one of Doc's henchmen, his moll and an office full of rabbits that the henchman wants to use to make a fur coat for his moll. The criminals are told that Big Morgan's brutal son \\"Baby Face\\" is running things and they believe Doc's stories of his cruelty. Doc believes the Federal authorities are occupied with Japanese-Americans and the German American Bund so they will have a free run. The gangsters begin to extort trucking companies and all pay up, except one led by Virginia (Mary Carlisle) who throws the gangster out of her office. They plan revenge by destroying one of her trucks on its run. When Virginia's courage makes the newspapers, Ollie decides that their insurance company can sell policies to the victims of \\"Baby Face Morgan\\" though Edward does not realise that he is Baby Face. When Virginia and Edward meet they fall in love. Virginia buys a large policy, the gangsters destroy the truck and Edward pays off the next day. Edward's prompt payment leads all the other trucking companies to purchase policies from Acme Protection and challenge the gangsters to destroy their old vehicles when they refuse to pay the extortion. It does not take long before the Mob comes looking for their profits that have been recycled back to the trucking companies. \\"Baby Face\\" takes a crash course in acting as a tough guy. Reception According to B Movies by Don Miller, \\"Most of the remainder of the 1942 PRC product dealt with gangsters, crime or whodunit puzzles, reliable standbys of the indie companies catering to action and grind theater houses. Baby Face Morgan played it for laughs, with Cromwell as a rube posing as a tough racketeer. Armstrong, [co-star] Chick Chandler and Carlisle lent strong support, and while it never scaled any heights it was a passable spoof of the genre.\\"Miller, Don (1988). B Movies.

The band consists of Emily Kokal (vocals, guitar), Theresa Wayman (vocals, guitar), Jenny Lee Lindberg (bass, vocals), and Stella Mozgawa (drums). To date, the band has released four studio albums: Exquisite Corpse(EP, 2008), The Fool (2010), Warpaint (2014), and Heads Up (2016). History Beginning and formation (2004‚Äì2007) Warpaint formed in Los Angeles on Valentine's Day 2004. The original lineup consisted of childhood friends Wayman and Kokal alongside sisters Lindberg and Shannyn Sossamon. The band played in the Los Angeles area for three years, writing songs (\\"Stars\\", \\"Beetles\\" and \\"Elephants\\") which would eventually comprise their debut EP. Exquisite Corpse (2007‚Äì2009) The band began recording their debut EP, Exquisite Corpse, in December 2007, with producer Jacob Bercovici. The sessions took over two months and concluded with mixing and mastering by John Frusciante, who was also Kokal's boyfriend at the time. Warpaint self-released the EP in 2008, which quickly moved to No. 1 on the Los Angeles Amoeba Records local artist chart. In 2009, Exquisite Corpse was rereleased worldwide by Manimal Vinyl, to critical acclaim. The song \\"Elephants\\" featured in the 2011 independent horror film Siren, directed by Andrew Hull and released by Lionsgate. Current Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante mixed and mastered Exquisite Corpse. Former RHCP guitarist Josh Klinghoffer performed drums and guitar on the EP in 2007. Australian drummer Mozgawa (formerly of Mink and Swahili Blonde) joined the band in the winter of 2009. Shortly afterwards, Warpaint were signed to Rough Trade Records, and immediately began extensive touring throughout the United States and Europe, including an opening slot for the xx. On December 6, 2010, the BBC announced that Warpaint had been nominated for the BBC's Sound of 2011 poll and they were the cover stars of Beat magazine's Winter 2010 launch issue. The Fool (2009‚Äì2011) On October 25, 2010, the band released their debut album, The Fool. The album received a glowing review from NME. Prior to the album's release, the band contributed a cover of the David Bowie song \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" to We Were So Turned On, a Bowie tribute album released in conjunction with War Child. \\"Shadows\\", the first single from their debut album, was released as a digital download and 12\\" vinyl on January 10, 2011. A remix of the single, \\"Shadows (Neon Lights Remix)\\", proved popular; managing to be playlisted by BBC Radio 1 as part of \\"In New Music We Trust\\". Warpaint toured the U.S. and Europe in the spring and summer of 2011 to promote the album. They played at various major festivals including Summer Sundae, Bonnaroo, Glastonbury Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Rock Werchter, and Electric Picnic. In 2011, the rerelease of the track \\"Undertow\\" as a single charted in the UK at No. 92 and in Australia at No. 75. On September 25, 2011, they played the prestigious Hollywood Bowl, sharing the bill with TV on the Radio, Arctic Monkeys, Panda Bear and Smith Westerns. Warpaint (2014‚Äì2015) Warpaint performing in 2014 As early as 2011, drummer Mozgawa, in an interview with NME, expressed the band's intention to \\"experiment and write with one another\\" as the current lineup had never composed songs \\"from the ground up\\" together. Bassist Lindberg further indicated that most of the newer songs were written by \\"just jam[ming] and free-flow[ing] onstage\\". In February 2013, Wayman confirmed to NME that the band intended to create a minimalist sound on Warpaint, revealing that the band developed songs at soundchecks, and experimented more with acoustic guitars and percussion instruments on the album. Lead vocalist Kokal noted that R&B; and rap music were influences on Warpaint and stated that the album featured \\"things that have drum machines and ambience, music that's more than standard rock\\". Kokal added that the album was largely keyboards-based, which contributed to the overall sound being \\"definitely different\\" from the band's previous album, The Fool. Produced and mixed by Flood, except two tracks which were mixed by Nigel Godrich, Warpaint was released by Rough Trade on January 17, 2014 in Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Switzerland; January 20 in Denmark, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom; and January 21 in Spain and the U.S. A snippet of the album's lead single, \\"Love Is to Die\\", was featured in an advertisement for Calvin Klein on September 25, 2013 and later as part of a teaser for an upcoming documentary of the same name about the recording of Warpaint. The single was released on October 28 with the pre-ordered digital version of the album. On November 20, Warpaint performed \\"Composure,\\" from The Fool, as well as new songs \\"Love Is to Die\\" and \\"Keep It Healthy\\", on BBC 6 Music with Steve Lamacq in the U.K. The next day, an article from the December 2013 issue of Dazed & Confused magazine appeared online, providing insight into the making of the new album, as well as the accompanying documentary, filmed by Lindberg's husband, video artist Chris Cunningham (the subject of the song \\"CC\\"). Lindberg later confirmed in a November 24 interview on XFM that Cunningham's documentary would be made available shortly after the album's release. A music video, composed of a two-song vignette from the second album‚Äî\\"Disco//very\\" and \\"Keep it Healthy\\"‚Äîwas released in April 2014. Directed by Laban Pheidias, the video featured skateboarding from professional skateboarders Justin Eldridge, Kris Markovich and Patrick Melcher. The band toured in promotion of the album up to summer 2015, after which its members began separate projects. Kokal collaborated with folk musician Paul Bergmann, contributing vocals to Bergmann's extended play Romantic Thoughts (2015); Wayman formed a supergroup, BOSS, with Sarah Jones of Hot Chip and Guro Gikling of All We Are, and recorded material for a solo album; Mozgawa recorded with Andy Clockwise and Kurt Vile; and Lindberg released her debut solo album, Right On! (2015), on which Mozgawa also performed drums. Heads Up (2016‚Äìpresent) On August 1, 2016, Warpaint released a single titled \\"New Song\\", and announced the September 23 release of its third studio album, Heads Up. Beginning August 23 until October 27, 2017, they toured as special guest and opening act of Depeche Mode's Global Spirit Tour. Their four dates opening for Depeche Mode at the Hollywood Bowl marked the first time a band played four consecutive shows at the famed Los Angeles venue. The band also toured in support of Harry Styles on a handful of dates in Asia in May 2018. Style Warpaint's style has been characterized as art rock, dream pop and psychedelic rock. NME has described their style as \\"intermittently emerging from plaintive moods into harder rocking, they play expansive, lushly-harmonic psych-rock songs with enough time-changes to satisfy even the most beardy prog-rock bong- tokers\\". They have been compared to Cocteau Twins, Joni Mitchell, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Other influences include Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and Public Image Ltd. The band has also cited hip-hop as an influence of their work. Two songs have been named after their favorite rappers: Biggy and Dre.

It was released as a single in December 1971 from the band's 1971 LP Muswell Hillbillies, an album with blues and country roots. It centered on such themes as poverty, housing development, alienation, the welfare state, and other troubles of the modern world.  Synopsis  In \\"20th Century Man\\", the singer expresses his regrets and worries about the modern world, \\"This is the age of machinery, a mechanical nightmare\\", and that there is \\"too much aggravation\\". As such, the singer claims that he's \\"gotta get out of here\\", and that \\"we've gotta find a solution\\". As part of the refrain he exclaims he's \\"a twentieth century man but I don't want to die here\\". As the song progresses he criticizes modern art claiming he prefers time-honored masters such as William Shakespeare, Rembrandt van Rijn, Titian, Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Gainsborough (\\"You keep all your smart modern painters, I'll take Rembrandt, Titian, Da Vinci and Gainsborough\\"). The song culminates with a bridge, in which he explains that he was born into a welfare state, \\"ruled by bureaucracy\\", as he claims. The singer also claims that he's \\"Got no privacy\\", and \\"got no liberty\\". The song finishes with a resounding protest against these \\"20th century men\\". Instrumentation \\"20th Century Man\\" is a slight departure from the rest of the songs on Muswell Hillbillies, with a heavier rock sound and beat. It begins with a gentle strum on the acoustic guitar, but slowly rises and changes into a powerful rock song (see \\"synopsis\\" section). Whilst the rest of Muswell Hillbillies featured purposely dated recording techniques, to give it an antiquated feel, \\"20th Century Man\\" was recorded separately with then modern recording equipment. Single release \\"20th Century Man\\" was released as a single in December 1971 in the US (it would never see single release in the UK), and was backed by \\"Skin and Bone\\". It failed to gain a significant hold on the charts, not managing to reach the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #106. The single reached #9 in Boston, and #113 on the Cash Box \\"Looking Ahead\\" survey. Versions Multiple versions and edits of \\"20th Century Man\\" exist. On the original Muswell Hillbillies full- length version, the length is 5:57. In the case of the 7\\" single, the length is two minutes shorter, at about 3:57. On the \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation The Kinks' Greatest: Celluloid Heroes an edit of about 4:57 is present. A live version, which omits some of the lyrics in the bridge of the studio recording, is included on The Kinks' 1980 album One for the Road. Ray Davies also performed the song in his 1996-1997 \\"Storyteller\\" show in support of his semi- fictionalized autobiography X-Ray, a recording of which was released on the album, The Storyteller, in 1998.

She made nine voyages to the East between 1796 and 1816, most direct to China. In 1804 she participated in the Battle of Pulo Aura. In 1816, the company sold her for breaking up. Origins She was the second East Indiaman named Warley that John Perry built at his yard in Blackwall Yard. Perry built her predecessor in 1788; in 1795 the EIC sold the first of Perry's Warleys to the Royal Navy, which renamed her . Warley's captain for her first five voyages was Henry Wilson, who had also been captain of the first Warley for her two voyages.British Library: Warley (2). Voyages 1, 2 and 3 Warley sailed under a letter of marque dated 1 January 1797, which named Wilson as the captain. Voyage 1 (1797‚Äì1798) Captain Henry Wilson sailed on 18 March 1797 from Portsmouth, bound for Bombay and China. Warley arrived at Bombay on 4 July and left on 1 October.

The historical region of Maishan or Maysan (Syriac: ) is situated in southern Iraq and Kuwait. The metropolitans of Maishan sat at Prath d'Maishan (Syriac: ), and for most of its history the province had three suffragan dioceses, at Karka d'Maishan (Syriac: ), Rima (Syriac: ) and Nahargur (Syriac: ). The last metropolitan of Maishan, the noted East Syriac author Shlemun (Solomon) of Basra, is attested in 1222, and it is not clear when the province ceased to exist.Fiey, AC, iii. 266‚Äì71; POCN, 59‚Äì60  Background  The province of Maishan was one of the six metropolitan provinces created by the Church of the East at the synod of Isaac in 410. The bishop of Prath d'Maishan was recognised as 'metropolitan of Karka d'Maishan, of Rima, of Nahargur, and of their bishops‚Äô in Canon XXI of the synod. He ranked fourth in precedence, after the metropolitan bishops of Seleucia, Beth Lapat and Nisibis and before the metropolitan bishops of Erbil and Karka d‚ÄôBeth Slokh.Chabot, 272‚Äì3 Eliya of Damascus listed two suffragan dioceses in the 'eparchy of al-Basra' in 893: Destesana (Karka d'Maishan) and Nahr al-Mara (Rima).Assemani, BO, ii. 485‚Äì9 The province of Maishan seems to have come to an end in the thirteenth century. The metropolitan diocese of Prath d‚ÄôMaishan is last mentioned in 1222, and the suffragan dioceses of Nahargur, Karka d'Maishan (Dastumisan), and Rima (Nahr al-Dayr) probably ceased to exist rather earlier. The diocese of Nahargur is last mentioned in 893, under the name Abdasi, in the list of Eliya of Damascus, as a diocese in the province of the patriarch.Assemani, BO, ii. 485‚Äì9 It is not known when or why the diocese was transferred from the province of Maishan. The last-known bishop of Karka d'Maishan, Abraham, was present at the synod held by the patriarch Yohannan IV shortly after his election in 900, and an unnamed bishop of Rima attended the consecration of Eliya I in Baghdad in 1028.Fiey, AC, iii. 272‚Äì82  The diocese of Prath d'Maishan (Basra)  The bishop David of 'Basra' (Prath d'Maishan), who flourished c.285, 'left his throne to go to India, where he converted a large crowd of hearers'.Chronicle of Seert (ed.

The highest elevation of the Comox Glacier, , refers to a rocky outcrop on the north side of the glacier. Lacking an official name, it is referred to as the Comox Glacier summit. The Comox Glacier is a member of the Vancouver Island Ranges which in turn form part of the Insular Mountains.Comox Glacier History The name Comox Glacier comes from the name of the K'√≥moks First Nation who inhabit the area. They refer to the mountain by the name Kw√©nis, which means \\"whale\\". This name comes from a traditional account of the Great Flood: a whale was said to be trapped up on the mountain when the flood receded. In the early 1900s, the glacier was known as Dome Glacier. The name Comox Glacier was officially adopted in 1939, at the suggestion of the Comox & District Mountaineering Club. Access There are two direct routes to the Comox Glacier: 1\\\\. Comox Glacier Trail (aka Frog's Pond Route) - the most direct route to the Comox Glacier. It begins where Datsio Creek meets Comox Creek. The route initially heads up the valley towards Century Sam Lake, but quickly gains the ridge to the west. The route follows the height of the ridge up to Lone Tree Pass, and on to the south flanks of the Comox Glacier. 2\\\\. Kookjai Route - this route starts at Cougar Lake, near the Comox Gap. It traverse over Kookjai Mountain and Black Cat Mountain before meeting up with the Comox Glacier Trail at Lone Tree Pass. Alternatively, the Comox Glacier can be accessed by traversing from Argus Mountain to the west, or climbing up from Milla Lake to the north.

Intrinsic value exists wherever self- valuing beings exist. Taylor (1996) \\"Forms of capital and intrinsic value,\\" Chemosphere (1996) Vol. 33, No. 9, pp. 1801-1811. https://www.academia.edu/25475674/FORMS_OF_CAPITAL_AND_INTRINSIC_VALUES Because intrinsic value is self-ascribed, all animals have it, unlike instrumental or extrinsic values. Instrumental value is the value that others confer on an animal (or on any other entity) because of its value as a resource (e.g. as property, labour, food, fibre, 'ecosystem services') or as a source of emotional, recreational, aesthetic or spiritual gratification. Intrinsic values are conferred from within an animal, and are therefore not directly measurable by economists, while extrinsic values are conferred from outside and can, in principle, be measured econometrically. The phrase \\"intrinsic value\\" (often used synonymously with inherent value) has been adopted by animal rights advocates. The Dutch Animal Health and Welfare Act referred to it in 1981: \\"Acknowledgment of the intrinsic value of animals means that animals have value in their own right and as a consequence their interests are no longer automatically subordinate to man's interests.\\"Cock Buning, Tj. (2006). \\"Empirisch onderzoek naar morele oordeelsvorming bij genetische modificatie van dieren,\\" NVBE Nieuwsbrief, 13,3, 10‚Äì12. This acknowledgement has stirred a debate on what it entails in the context of animal husbandry, animal breeding, vivisection, animal testing and biotechnology. It is also used by environmental advocates and in law to holistically encompass the totality of intrinsic values in an ecosystem. Article 7(d) of New Zealand's Resource Management Act (RMA), for example, requires particular regard to be to given to \\"intrinsic values of ecosystems\\" New Zealand Parliament (1991) Resource Management Act http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1991/0069/latest/whole.html#DLM230267  History of the moral status of animals (1880‚Äì1980)  Moral attitudes towards animals in the west (as expressed in public debate and legislation) have changed considerably over time. Britain's first anti-cruelty laws were introduced in the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. This was followed by similar laws in many other countries, especially in the second half of the 20th century. These laws did not challenge the idea that other animals are resources for human use and they only limited those acts of cruelty which (a) had few economic or social repercussions; and (b) were offensive to human sensibilities (the so-called Offence principle) or at odds with human dignity. These regulations were anthropocentric in character: they generally gave human economic and recreational interests, such as farming, fishing and blood sports, greater priority than animal suffering - that is they favoured the animals' instrumental values over their intrinsic ones. During the second half of the 20th century, the intensification of cattle breeding, the growth of pig and chicken factory farming and the increased use of animals in harmful laboratory experiments provoked fierce debates in which the negative consequences for the animals themselves became an issue. Notably during the 1960s and 1970s, pressure groups started to argue on behalf of the interests of animals kept in laboratories and farms. They expressed their discontent with laws that protected the institutional cruelty of the animal exploitation industries while only prohibiting selected acts of individual cruelty in certain situations. They called for new forms of legislation that would protect animals for non-anthropocentric reasons. In these discussions (of the moral relevance of the animal's welfare) two key issues were involved. To begin with, the Harm principle, rather than the Offence principle, should be the moral foundation for the protection of animals. Secondly, as to the scepticism expressed by scientists regarding the presence of consciousness and self-awareness in animals, they should be granted the benefit of the doubt by adopting the so-called analogy postulate. Applied ethological research into the behaviour of animals in captivity made it clear that the intensive use of animals had negative effects on the animal's health and well-being. Nevertheless, concern for the well-being of animals had to be purged from anthropomorphism and sentimentalism. This point of view is taken for example in a report by the Dutch Federation of Veterinarians in the EEC (FVE, 1978) concerning welfare-problems among domestic animals. This document states that: > although the interests of animals often conflict with the demands of > society, society remains responsible for the welfare of the animals > involved. Considerations regarding animal welfare ought to be based on > veterinary, scientific and ethological norms, but not on sentiment. And > although animals do not have fundamental rights, human beings have certain > moral obligations towards them.  Intrinsic value and animal ethics (1980‚Äì2000)  During the 1970s and 1980s, the criticism regarding the living conditions of farm and laboratory animals became mixed up with other social debates, notably the discussions concerning the protection of the (natural) environment and the ones concerning the development of new breeding techniques. Due to this broadening of the issues, other objections against the use of animals for scientific or economic reasons emerged. The instrumental use of the animals, it was said, is hard to reconcile with their intrinsic (or inherent) value. In 1981 the Dutch government included the intrinsic value-argument in a statement concerning the protection of animals (CRM, 1981). Now a principle was formulated that allowed for the possibility that, in some cases, the interests of animals might prevail over and above those of science and industry. The interests of the animal involved health and well-being as experienced by the animals themselves, independent from considerations concerning their suitability for human use. It was now claimed that animals have an intrinsic value, that is a good-of-their-own, and an interest in their own well-being. Developments within the field of biotechnology broadened the scope of the debate on the moral status of animals even more. After the controversy concerning the transgenic bull Herman and the lactoferrin project of GenePharming, modern biotechnology has almost become a synonym for genetic engineering. In the debate on bull Herman, concern for the intrinsic value of animals became an issue in its own right. Many felt that there was more to intrinsic value than merely the concern for the animal's welfare. Since then, intrinsic value not only refers to the animal's welfare, but also to the moral attitude society takes towards animals (or nature) as such. For some, this stance means a return to the Offence principle, and therefore not helpful in the struggle against anthropocentrism or anthropomorphism. Others however maintain that recognition of the intrinsic value of animals goes beyond animal welfare, since it respects the animal as \\"centre of its own being\\".  Analysis of the term intrinsic value  The cause of much confusion in the discussion over intrinsic value in relation to the moral status of animals, is the diversity of meanings and connotations associated with intrinsic value. Broadly speaking there are 4 main positions in this debate defining intrinsic value. One can adhere to a meaning of intrinsic value of animals in a sense that is:van der Tuuk, Edward. \\"Intrinsic value & the struggle against anthropocentrism,\\" in Dol, Marcel et al. Recognizing the Intrinsic Value of Animals, APS, Van Gorcum, Assen, 1999, chapter 2, pp. 29‚Äì37. * behaviouristic, as a morally neutral value that the animal's own (hence intrinsic) species-specific behaviour seeks to satisfy. Ethologists like Nikolaas Tinbergen and Gerard Baerends refer in this context to expectancy-values (see also ethology) * utilitarian, as a formal basis to grant animals specific rights, based upon the idea of sentience and interests, defined by ethological knowledge, and defines corresponding human obligations (see also Peter Singer's ideas about Equal consideration of interests) * deontological, as respect for the animal's telos or striving and consequential fundamental rights (see also Tom Regan's ideas about inherent value and animal rights) * attitudinal, as prima facie respect for all living beings, regardless of qualities like sentience (see also Reverence for Life and Ethical intuitionism and Moral sense theory) Of the first, behaviouristic interpretation, one can say (since it is morally neutral) that it is useless to ethical theory. Of the fourth, attitudinal or intuitionistic interpretation, one can say that it is indiscriminate of sentience or interests, and could be used for any kind of (natural, cultural or abstract) entity worth protecting (including species, cultures, languages, historical buildings or sites, etc.). The core issue in the debate over intrinsic value of animals remains between utilitarianists and deontologists.

Stiles grew Strala from one studio based in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City to a studio and training business with currently over 1,000 instructors (called Guides) leading classes in 15 countries regularly to thousands of people weekly. Harvard did a case study on Stiles' business titled The Branding of Yoga, which uses Stiles as a case study in branding. In 2007, Tara starred in Yoga For, produced by Ford Models. Vanity Fair reported on a yoga video that Stiles specifically designed for Sarah Palin; the \\"Vanity Fair\\" reporter commented, \\"Tara Stiles has got to be the coolest yoga instructor ever.\\"\\"Vanity Fair\\" coverage of Tara Stiles Early life Stiles grew up outside of the Chicago Metropolitan area, in Morris, Illinois. Her parents designed their passive solar home, helped by the fact her father worked at a nuclear plant. She has one sibling, an older brother, Chad, who is an electrician. Career Stiles studied dance in Chicago, where one of her ballet instructors introduced her to yoga. A local photographer brought her to Marie Anderson Boyd, founder of Aria Models in Chicago, later acquired by Ford Models. Ford asked her to make short promotional yoga videos for the agency and post them to YouTube. She took a 200-hour course to become a certified instructor, and continues to make the videos, which have drawn over twenty million views. Stiles was one of the first yoga instructors to use social media to attract students. The YouTube videos led to a DVD with fellow model Brooklyn Decker as well as one of her own, Yoga Anywhere: The New York Session. After leaving Ford and modeling in 2007, she blogged for Women's Health and The Huffington Post (HuffPo). A 2009 post at HuffPo entitled \\"Help! I'm Addicted to Facebook\\", has received 1.2 million hits, making it one of the most-viewed blog posts on the site. Stiles's first book, Slim Calm Sexy, was published by Rodale in 2010. Stiles has been featured in pictorials for W, Shape Magazine, Self, Marie Claire, Fitness, and has appeared on the covers of Shape, Time Out, and Fit Yoga. Stiles appeared in ads for Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Target Corporation, Gap, and American Apparel,http://www.elephantjournal.com/2009/08/tara-stiles-does-yoga- for-american-apparel as well as numerous TV commercials for the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Avon. Stiles' health and yoga related work has been featured in such magazines as Esquire, Men's Health, Ascent, and Yoga Journal. Stiles has been the Face of Women's Health, a Rodale, Inc. publication, from April 2009 through April 2011. Stiles was also a spokesperson for Nissan Motors.\\"Master the Shift\\" Strala Yoga In 2008, Stiles met her husband Michael Taylor at the Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York.\\"Krishna Das\\" \\"He was normal, he's straight, he does yoga ... I'm done for,\\" she joked. After a civil ceremony in New York, they honeymooned in Negril, Jamaica. The couple founded the New York City yoga studio StralaStrala later that year. They made up the name, which is similar to the Swedish word \\"str√•la\\" which means to \\"radiate light\\". In addition to continuing to make her videos and other media appearances, Stiles currently teaches a quarter of the classes and oversees 13 other instructors at the studio, which has become profitable enough for her to consider opening a branch. Deepak Chopra and Jane Fonda are among her students; the former considers her his personal instructor. \\"I have been doing yoga for 30 years,\\" he says. \\"I have had teachers of all kinds. Taking lessons from her has been more useful to me than taking yoga from anyone else.\\" Stiles does not follow any school of yoga or instructor and focuses purely on its physical aspects and health benefits, with no philosophical or spiritual dimension. She eschews the Sanskrit names for yoga positions and does not ask students to chant. She hires instructors without regard to the certification process normally required elsewhere, preferring to assess them by watching them teach, although Strala does offer a teacher-training program. Strala's per-class fee, $10, is lower than other Manhattan yoga studios. Her goal is to make yoga more accessible. \\"People need yoga, not another religious leader. Quite often in New York, they want to be religious leaders, and it's not useful,\\" she explains. \\"I was never invited to the party anyway‚Äîso I started my own party.\\" Too many people outside yoga, she believes, see it as \\"something Jennifer Aniston does.\\" Fonda has praised \\"her ability to make yoga accessible to people who might be scared of it or think it might be too esoteric.\\" Stiles says she receives letters regularly from people, such as military men, who do her videos but are afraid to go to a yoga studio. \\"This studio is the first place I have felt comfortable,\\" one Strala student told The New York Times. \\"It doesn't feel like it's all 26-year-old former dancers.\\" Stiles' approach to yoga has met with some controversy in the yoga community. Jennilyn Carson of the popular YogaDork blog reports that some practitioners consider it \\"disrespect to what the practice is\\" for Stiles to promote it as a weight-loss method. \\"I don't care what Tara Stiles says yoga is,\\" another yogini says. \\"It's not about making your body beautiful.\\" Yoga traditionalists have also complained about her willingness to draw on her modeling background and exploit sex appeal in yoga-wear advertisements and her videos, some of which she has appeared in wearing short shorts and a tank top. \\"Who made these rules?\\", Stiles has responded. \\"I feel like I'm standing up for yoga.\\" To critics of her videos and photo shoots, she says, \\"We should not be hiding behind our bodies. [They] should be empowering.\\" To critics of her method of yoga instruction she said, \\"When they come to class, they see that we're guiding every single moment of movement. It's not chaos.\\" Strala expansion Strala launched as a style of yoga in 2010 and began holding Ready-to-Lead and Intensive Training programs at its headquarters in NYC, and around the world.

It is a portrait of the Faroese sculptor Hans Pauli Olsen (born 1957). Synopsis The film follows the creation of sculptor Hans Pauli Olsen's biggest sculpture so far. We take part in the process when the artist is working in his backyard studio together with his young nude model. We are the fly on the wall, when the artist forgets about the camera and exists only for creating his art with his bare hands.

Experimental work with dodecanedioic acid in type 2 diabetic patients has demonstrated that IV infusion helps to maintain normal blood sugar and energy levels without increasing the blood glucose load in the process.  Production  DDDA is currently produced by both chemical and biological routes.  Chemical process  It has traditionally been produced from butadiene using a multi- step chemical process. Butadiene is first converted to cyclododecatriene through a cyclotrimerization process. Cyclododecatriene (1) is converted to dodecanedioic acid (4) by hydrogenation to cyclododecane (2) followed by air oxidation in the presence of boric acid at elevated temperatures to a mixture of the alcohol (3a) and the ketone (3b). In the final step, this mixture oxidized further by nitric acid. 620x620px  Biological process  Paraffin wax can be converted into DDDA with a special strain of Candida tropicalis yeast in a multi-step process.

In September 2000, Our Lady Seat of Wisdom Academy was established, and the school had its first official academic year which saw nine students and several teachers. In 2003, \\"the Academy\\" as it was called, added a second year of study to their program, and a third year in 2004. By the beginning of the 2015-2016 academic year, the student body had grown to 108 students. In September 2017, there were 136 students and a student-faculty ratio of 13:1.

Euplectrus is a cosmopolitan genus and are easily distinguished from other members of the subfamily Eulophinae by three characteristics i.e. the hind tibial spurs are very long and strong with the longest spur being no less than half as long as hind tarsus and is used to anchor the female wasp to the dorsum of the host caterpillar during oviposition; the scutellum has no lateral grooves or pit-rows; and propodeum has a single strong median carina. It is a morphologically conservative genus and the species vary slightly from one another and this creates difficulties in identifying the species. Euplectrus wasps have been found as parasitoids on the caterpillars of the families Erebidae, Euteliidae, Geometridae, Lasiocampidae, Noctuidae, Nolidae, Notodontidae, Sphingidae and Tortricidae. The larvae of all species of Euplectrus are greenish-yellow and are very obvious on the host caterpillar's cuticle to which they are very firmly attached. The parasitized caterpillars feed and remain active but stop growing and moulting. . Euplectrus sp. - lifecycle A - 02 - dispersing (2009-04-21) The larvae of the wasps in the genus Euplectrus are external parasitoids of the caterpillars of various species of Lepidoptera. They are normally gregarious, laying between five and several hundred eggs per host caterpillar, although a few species lay a single egg on each host. SOme species paralyse the host while others do not but in all cases the female injects the host with venom prior to oviposition. The venom stops the host from going through ecdysis, as the wasp larvae would be shed with the moulted cuticle and eventually causing the caterpillar to die, although the wasp larvae will have fully developed and spun a cocoon by that time. The eggs are positioned under the host's cuticle but above the hypodermis each egg has a pedicel with an anchor at its end which fastens the egg to the host. The eggs are normally laid on the back of the caterpillar and the larvae stay at the laying site until they complete their development sucking on the caterpillar's haemolymph. When they have completed their growth they migrate to the underside of the caterpillar and spin a loose cocoon in which they pupate, in some species the larvae spin communal cocoons around the dying host. The ability of Euplectrus larvae to spin cocoons is unique among the Eulophidae and the silk which forms the cocoon is produced in modified malpighian tubules and is exuded from the anal opening. The larva undergoes 3‚Äì5 molts before pupation and the development from oviposition to imago is normally no longer than two weeks.

Some of those organizations included the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. aid mission (USOM), the U.S. Information Service (USIS), and the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG). The school also accepted for enrollment the dependent children of private American firms operating in Saigon, as well as some non-U.S. diplomatic families. Some Vietnamese children also attended the school. The school grew rapidly as U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War escalated, but was permanently closed in February 1965 when all dependents of U.S. government personnel were ordered out of Vietnam by President Lyndon Johnson. Overview of school history The American Community School (ACS) in Saigon had its beginning in 1954, providing schooling for younger dependent children of American government employees and military personnel stationed there. In 1957 it expanded to include high school students and continued to grow rapidly as more U.S. government and military advisory personnel were committed to South Vietnam. By order of President Lyndon Johnson, dependents of U.S. diplomatic, aid mission, and military personnel were ordered to leave Vietnam in February 1965. Evacuation of the dependents had been a matter of concern for the administration for more than a year. Some dependents apparently left on passenger planes that were sent on to Saigon after having delivered Marine Corps troops deployed to Danang, where a HAWK air defense battalion was put in place to defend nearby American air assets. Having lost the bulk of its enrollment, as well as most of the teaching staff (many of whom were U.S. dependent wives with teaching credentials), the school closed its doors. Dependents of Americans working for private firms in Vietnam were not covered by the Presidential order, and so the education of those choosing to remain in Saigon was later provided by several private schools established in Saigon after the evacuation. One of these schools was called the ‚ÄúPhoenix Study Group‚Äù, whose students were described as ‚Äúchildren of diplomats, wealthy businessmen and American civilians.‚Äù This follow-on school remained in existence until the fall of South Vietnam to forces of North Vietnam in April 1975. Instructional format The teachers at ACS were, for the most part, wives of U.S. government employees stationed in Saigon. They possessed teaching certificates or degrees from American educational institutions. French language instruction was provided by qualified local French citizens. The elementary school classes were taught using the Calvert method. For the first several years, high school instruction was via correspondence course material graded by the high school division of the University of California. Consequently, the high school teachers generally served in the role of tutors rather than lecturing. But by the 1962-63 school year, ACS had grown to the status of a college preparatory high school with high academic standards. Testing programs showed that ACS high school students were at a level 20% higher than their contemporaries in Stateside schools. Growth and locations of the school Home schooling The school began in the Saigon home of the wife of a U.S. government employee, in 1954 (the year of the defeat of French military forces at Battle of Dien Bien Phu). Students were all younger elementary age children. Norodom Compound Stanvac building in Saigon, newly constructed in 1955 and temporary home for ACSA second dependent wife soon joined in teaching elementary age students. This second class of pupils met in a small building in the Norodom Compound (one of several U.S. government facilities located in Saigon), situated near the Presidential Palace. The next academic year, two Quonset hut buildings were erected in the compound, and the home-schooled elementary school students joined those already at Norodom Compound. Shortly thereafter, near the end of 1955, one of the Quonset huts burned to the ground, and most of the students‚Äô books were destroyed. While the hut was being rebuilt for the 1956-57 academic year (an additional and larger Quonset hut was also erected), the school temporarily moved into the newly built Stanvac building, which housed the Saigon headquarters for a Dutch-owned oil company's property. When the rebuilding in the Norodom Compound was complete, this expansion made it possible for the creation of a high school for American dependent children in Saigon. Norodom Compound later became the site of the new multi-story U.S. Embassy that opened in 1967. Tan Son Hoa U.S. embassy building, built on the site of the old Norodom Compound, shown after the attack during the Tet Offensive in January 1968American Community School, Saigon, circa 1960 For the 1958-59 school year the school moved out of the Norodom Compound into newly built permanent buildings near Saigon‚Äôs Tan Son Nhat International Airport, at the street address 10 Tan Son Hoa (today the street address is 247 Hoang Van Thu). The extra space at this new location was quickly put to use as the school continued to expand, enrolling high school age children who previously had been sent to private boarding schools elsewhere (including the Philippines). At the beginning of the 1959-60 school year, the high school enrollment stood at 28 students, as noted in the school‚Äôs first yearbook (named The Gecko) that year. The following school year, 1960‚Äì61, a count of the number of high school students pictured in the second yearbook shows that the high school enrollment had doubled to at least 56. When opened for the 1958-59 school year, the school had 5 classroom wings. During the 1962-63 school year a 2-story wing was added. In February 1965, the school was permanently closed when President Lyndon Johnson ordered all dependents of U.S. government and military personnel to be evacuated from Vietnam. Contemporaneous news accounts of that evacuation reported the enrollment of the school (both high school and elementary grades) to have been 750. An additional building wing had been completed the previous weekend, never to be occupied by any students of ACS. Later use of the ACS buildings 7th Military Zone Museum, circa 2004, courtesy of Tucker Smallwood Within three months of the departure of U.S. government dependents from Saigon, and closing of the American Community School, the buildings that had been ACS were converted into a medical facility for the U.S. Army‚Äôs 3rd Field Hospital. The complex underwent extensive expansion and this hospital continued to function as a major military medical facility until 1973. Upon departure of U.S. military forces after the Paris Peace Accords, the facility became a new location for the existing Saigon Adventist Hospital, remaining such until the fall of Saigon in April 1975. The facilities are now occupied by the Southeastern Armed Forces Museum Military Zone 7.Website of a travel agency, References External links * http://www.saigonkids.com serves as a central information base for an informal alumni organization called \\"Saigon Kids,\\" people who as youngsters, during the period 1954-1965, shared the experience of living and being in school together in the capital city of South Vietnam.

It is a gall wasp which causes the formation of galls on a number of species of Eucalyptus, it was described in 2004 after galls were found in river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) in the Mediterranean and Middle East and has since been found to be a widespread species where its host trees are planted. It is indigenous to Australia. Description This tiny wasp is just over one millimeter in length. Its body is brown with a slight blue to green iridescence. Parts of the legs are yellowish in color. Distribution Leptocybe invasa is native to Queensland, Australia where its exact distribution has yet to be determined. It has now been found as an invasive species in eucalypts in northern, eastern and southern Africa, Asia, the Pacific Region, Europe as far north as the United Kingdom, southern Asia, southern South America, the Middle East, Mexico and the United States. It appears to be spreading.Leptocybe invasa. FAO Forest Pest Species Profiles. August 2012.Blue Gum Chalcid. Pest Fact Sheet. Asia-Pacific Forest Invasive Species Network. Developing galls Discovery L. invasa was discovered in 2000 when river red gums in the Middle East and Mediterranean began developing disfiguring galls. The damage became severe enough to cause crop losses in tree plantations. Galls were collected and a previously undescribed species of chalcid wasp emerged. In 2004 it was described to science as Leptocybe invasa. Biology The adult female injects a neat line of minute eggs in the epidermis of new leaf buds on eucalyptus trees. The leaf tissue may exude a whitish sap, which covers the oviposition site. Heavy wasp infestations can kill new buds on the trees. If the bud survives it develops a layer of corky tissue within one to two weeks of oviposition. This corky scar widens and becomes glossy in texture. It turns from green to pinkish to dark pink or red in color. It loses its glossy texture and turns dull brown or reddish. The chalcid wasp larva develops inside the gall and when it emerges as an adult insect the gall is spherical and up to 2.7 millimeters wide. During an infestation there are usually 3 to 6 galls per leaf, but up to 65 have been observed on a single leaf. The adult wasps emerge from the galls after growing inside for 3‚Äì4 months. In temperate areas there may be 2-3 generations of adults in a year but in the tropics there can be as many as 6 generations. The females can reproduce asexually by thelytokous reproduction and live for up to 7 days, males are rare and the asexual reproduction allows L. invasa to rapidly increase its population size. Several eucalyptus species are susceptible to the wasp. Host species include bangalay (Eucalyptus botryoides), apple box (E. bridgesiana), Tasmanian blue gum (E. globulus), cider gum (E. gunnii), flooded gum (E. grandis), swamp mahogany (E. robusta), Sydney blue gum (E. saligna), forest red gum (E. tereticornis), and manna gum (E. viminalis). Control Possible biological agents for L. invasa have been actively searched for and three hymenopteran parasitoids of L. invasa were identified, these were Quadrastichus mendeli, Aprostocetus causalis and Megastigmus viggianii. Quadrastichus mendeli has a short deleopmental time. Selitrichodes neseri is a eulophid ectoparasitoid which is species specific to L. invasa and was discovered in its native Australian range in 2014 and show potential as a biological control agent on L. invasa.

Biology Melittobia wasps are gregarious ectoparasitoids on solitary bees, honeybee and wasps, and also of any insect cohabitants of their hosts' nests, such as Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. One species has been reared from puparia of Anastrepha fruit flies collected from fallen fruits in Mexico. They show intrasexual and intersexual dimorphism with the males being blind and flightless and two castes of females, one long winged and one short winged, which are probably determined by nutrition. The females exhibit primitive social traits while the males are competitive ferociously fighting and killing their male siblings. The males attract the females using a pheromone and they have an elaborate courtship ritual. They have a skewed sex ration with 95% of the offspring being females which are from fertilised eggs but males are produced asexually through arrhenotoky. The females have overlapping adult generations and show close ties of kinship, parental care and altruistic cooperative escape behaviors. The best studied species from which most of the information about these wasps has been derived are Melittobia acasta, Melittobia australica and Melittobia digitata. These wasps are potentially economically harmful due to their lack of host specificity, fecundity, cryptic behaviour and behavioural flexibility. They have a rapid life cycle of 25 days. They breed well in the laboratory and are seen as potential model organisms in the study of genetics, developmental biology and ethology. Distribution Melittobia is found throughout the world.

He served as Bishop of Natchez from 1911 until his death in 1924. Biography Early life and ordination The oldest of eleven children, John Gunn was born in Fivemiletown, County Tyrone, to Edward and Mary (n√©e Grew) Gunn. From 1875 to 1880, he studied at St. Mary's College in Dundalk. He then attended the Marist House of Studies in Paignton, England (1880‚Äì1882) before furthering his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University (1885‚Äì1890). While in Rome, he made his profession in the Society of Mary on 23 August 1884, and was ordained to the priesthood by Patriarch Iulius Lenti on 2 February 1890. Professor Gunn then taught at St. Mary's in Dundalk until 1892, when he became professor of moral theology at the Marist House of Studies at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. In 1898 he was assigned to Atlanta, Georgia, where he served as pastor of the newly erected Sacred Heart Church. The parish was already in debt when he arrived, as evidenced by an entry he made in his ledger upon is arrival: \\"September 25, 1898. Cash on hand $0.00. Advanced by Father Gunn, $150.\\" In February 1899 it was necessary for him to advance $360 more to meet current expenses. He there purchased an organ and 21 stained glass windows; installed confessionals, furnace, carpeting, and a choir and organ gallery; covered the two towers with copper; and added a second story to the rectory. During his pastorate at Sacred Heart, he also founded and served as the first president of the Marist College, and established a parochial school. Bishop On 29 June 1911, Gunn was appointed the sixth Bishop of Natchez, Mississippi, by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 29 August from Archbishop James Blenk, SM, with Bishops Edward Patrick Allen and John Baptist Morris serving as co-consecrators, at Sacred Heart Church. Upon Gunn's arrival that September, the diocese contained 75 churches, 46 priests, and 17,000 Catholics. He then began extensive pastoral visits to all the parishes and missions throughout the diocese, which covered nearly 47,000 square miles. Chapel builder He received significant assistance from the Catholic Church Extension Society, and incorporated the diocese in 1918. He became known as the \\"Chapel Builder,\\" and by the time of his death, there were 149 churches and over 31,000 Catholics in the diocese. In 1915, while attending the installation of Archbishop George Mundelein at Detroit, a German spy laced the soup at a banquet with arsenic, poisoning Gunn and four others, but the Bishop survived. Following the end of World War I, he was considered for the Archbishop of New Orleans, Louisiana, but he refused the efforts. Death By January 1924, his failing health left him in critical condition. Gunn later died from a heart attack, aged 60. He is buried beside his predecessor, Bishop Thomas Heslin. In his will he states, \\"In life and in death I am proud of three things: My Irish birth, my Catholic faith, and my American citizenship. I tried to translate my love for all three into service and sacrifice.
