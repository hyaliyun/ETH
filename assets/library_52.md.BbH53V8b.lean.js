Luker had been deported as a convict from Middlesex, England and disembarked at Jervis Bay from the Atlantis in 1791, as part of the Third Fleet after a voyage of 146 days. In 1796, Luker was declared a freeman and became a police constable. On 26 August 1803, Luker was on a routine night patrol of Back Row East, now Phillip Street, Sydney, where a series of robberies had occurred. When his body was found the next day, he had suffered 16 horrific head wounds, with the guard of his cutlass embedded in his skull. Four men later faced court for his murder ‚Äì Joseph Samuel, Isaac Simmonds, Richard Jackson and James Hardwicke. Three were acquitted, as were two fellow constables. Samuel was originally sentenced to death for his role in a robbery, but this was commuted to life imprisonment after three attempts to hang him had failed. Simmonds was strongly suspected of involvement in Luker's death, but this was never sustained in court. Luker is now commemorated in the National Police Memorial at King's Park, Canberra.

Biography Dichter was born in 1935 in Borys≈Çaw (in modern-day Ukraine), where he survived the war. His father had died, and he and his mother (remarried after the war) came to live in Poland toward the end of 1944. He finished his studies at the Warsaw Polytechnic, where he earned his doctorate in mechanical engineering and worked until 1968. The antisemitic campaign that year in Poland provided the opportunity for him and his family to emigrate, through Vienna and Rome, eventually settling in the United States. As an expert in ballistics, he worked at Colt Firearms in the R&D; division and later in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1978, he became an image processing algorithm design specialist at the Linotype-Hell company. He and his wife Olga live in the Boston area. Works In 1996, the author's literary debut, God's Horse () was nominated for the Nike, Poland's top literary award. The book, an autobiographical, literary novel traces the life of the author from early childhood as he miraculously survives the Holocaust. The book is written without sentimentality and from the perspective of the child that he was at the time. It is simple and concise, and its literary style has been likened to that of Ernest Hemingway. The book soon became required reading for high school students in Poland. Dichter's second book, The Atheists' School (Szko≈Ça Bezbo≈ºnik√≥w), published in 2000, follows the author's life after the war in the newly established Communist Poland. It is a story of the coming of age of a young man in a culture that promises a bright new future. We follow as he experiences his life in an elite, secular high school, falls in love and is conflicted with adopting a life ideology. It was also a finalist for the Nike Award. In 2012, both novels, God's Horse and The Atheists' School, were published in English for the first time, translated by Madeline Levine, professor emeritus from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His third book, Learning English () begins with the chaos of emigration from Poland and tells of the creation of and adjustment to a new life for him and his family in the United States. It was released in Poland to critical acclaim in the second half of 2010. The translation of this book is currently under way. Dichter's books, particularly the first two, have been translated into Russian, French, Czech, German, Swedish, and Dutch. He also wrote \\"The Island of Physics\\", which has not been translated.

Somewhat haphazardly produced by the band in terms of the concept, Daniel Melero, the producer, decided to let the album's sound stand as the disorganized na√Øvet√© of an adolescent band. It ranks as one of the best New Argentine rock records. 1993's San Cipriano was another strong performance by the band, which strengthened their status. In the two years following Los Brujos would perform on stage with the likes of Nirvana, Soda Stereo, Babas√≥nicos, and Beastie Boys.  Guerra de nervios and separation (1995-1998)  Their third album, 1995's Guerra de NerviosLos Brujos www.rock.com.ar (Spanish) had involved some cool musicians as Gustavo Cerati, Daniel Melero and Aitor of Juana la Loca. It was a disc with an awesome production, reminiscent of the best science fiction films. After ten years together, Los Brujos announced their separation in 1998. With one of the major bands of the movement gone, their break-up was seen as the end of the New Argentine rock period, and the beginning of the suburban rock dominance of the late 1990s and early 2000s...  The Return (2014)  In late 2013 rumors began circulating online about Los Brujos¬¥s reunion. A large group of fans were clamoring for the return of the band for nearly two decades and finally their wishes were fulfilled.Volvieron Los Brujos by nicosaon (Spanish) On April 7, 2014 Los Brujos released a new single called \\"Beat Hit\\" and announced the release of their new album (Despierta Cronopio) and tour dates.

He made his senior debut in Burnley's 8‚Äì1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion in the 1966/67 season. He had a long and successful playing career, playing for almost 20 years and totalling over 450 league appearances whilst playing for Burnley, QPR, Everton, Vancouver Whitecaps, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers. He won 8 England caps overall whilst at Queens Park Rangers. His first England cap was given to him by manager Don Revie on 30 October 1974 in a 3‚Äì0 win against Czechoslovakia. He set up the first goal in the game. In 1981, he played a single summer season with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the North American Soccer League. Thomas's most successful season was undoubtedly 1975‚Äì76 while playing for QPR. QPR led the First Division for much of the season, narrowly missing out by one point to Liverpool after the final game of the season. Thomas was a pivotal figure in the team, providing Stan Bowles, Gerry Francis and others with outstanding service from the wing. Following his transfer to Everton, Thomas continued to enjoy success in the 1977‚Äì78 season while playing for Everton. Everton's top marksman Bob Latchford scored 30 goals in the league that season, Thomas providing more of his goals than anybody else with some more accurate crosses. His transfer in October 1972 from Burnley to QPR was then a record fee for a Second Division Club: ¬£165,000.

From September 2006 to August 2008 its main village, Chkhalta, hosted the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia and was the seat of the Azhara municipal community.United Nations Resolution on Abkhazia, April 2004, Res #65812 This situation came to an end in the Battle of the Kodori Valley in August 2008, when Upper Abkhazia was conquered by the Russo-Abkhazia armies, which had already controlled the rest of Abkhazia. Geography Geographically, Upper Abkhazia comprised the Upper Kodori Valley, the Chkhalta Ridge and the Marukhi Pass on the border with the Russian Federation. It was populated by some 2,000 people, chiefly ethnic Georgians (Svans). The area has a size of approximately 29% of Abkhazia's territory and is of high strategic importance, due to its proximity to the Abkhaz-held capital of Sukhumi and other important cities in the region. History The term Upper Abkhazia has been largely used by the Georgian officials and media since the successful operation of Georgian forces in the Kodori Valley in July 2006, which established firmer Georgian presence in the region. Before that the Georgian government had exercised a very loose control over Kodori, even though the Abkhaz separatist forces had never been able to penetrate the valley and the area had largely been run, since 1994, by the local warlord Emzar Kvitsiani, who was dislodged in the Georgian police operation in 2006. On September 27, 2006, on the 13th anniversary of the fall of Sukhumi to the Abkhaz rebels and their allies from the Northern Caucasus (1993), the Kodori region and the adjacent pieces of land, governed by Georgia, were officially renamed Upper Abkhazia and declared a \\"temporary administrative center\\" of Abkhazia and the headquarters of the de jure Abkhazian government.Georgia Today on the Web In spite of Abkhaz and Russian protests, a new office of the de jure government was inaugurated, on the same day, by a high ranking delegation from Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, including President Mikheil Saakashvili and the Catholicos Patriarch Ilia II.Tbilisi Turns Kodori into 'Temporary Administrative Center' of Abkhazia, Civil Georgia, September 27 2006. The area underwent a major rehabilitation program, including the reconstruction of infrastructure and reinforcement of security services. The Central Election Commission of Georgia had established the constituency of Upper Abkhazia, allowing the population of the area, for the first time in the recent history of Georgia, to take part in the Georgian local elections, 2006.First time in the history of Georgia the population of Kodori gorge will elect the representative body, The Central Election Commission of Georgia website, September 3, 2006.

On February 8, 2016, an announcement was made that the group would permanently disband effective immediately.  History   Founding  Harry Chapin moved to Long Island in 1972, and almost at once began using his celebrity status to improve his new hometown. \\"He thought Long Island represented a remarkable opportunity,\\" said Chapin's widow, Sandy. At his encouragement, a group of Long Island business leaders agreed to fund the formation of the Orchestra, under the musical directorship of Maestro Keene, with Chapin serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The LIP‚Äôs premiere concert occurred on the weekend of November 16, 17, and 18th, 1979. From its foundings, the orchestra recruited some of the finest musicians in the New York metropolitan area, and also supported a full chorus of dedicated amateur singers.  The Keene years  Maestro Keene was a proponent of new works, and brought in soloists of international reputation. Under his direction, the Philharmonic commissioned and premiered several works, including Jay Reise‚Äôs Symphony No. 3 ‚ÄúAwakening to Memory‚Äù.  The Alsop years  After Maestro Keene's departure, a nationwide search was conducted to find his replacement. Marin Alsop was selected based on having recently won both the Stokowski Conducting Competition and the Koussevitzky Conducting Prize. The Philharmonic hoped that her youth and exuberance would rejuvenate the orchestra. Under her baton, the orchestra thrived financially and musically.  Recent history  In 2004, celebrating its 25th anniversary, the orchestra nearly disappeared altogether. The final two concerts of the 2003/2004 concert series had to be canceled due to funding shortages. Governmental support has been provided by Sen. Hillary Clinton and State Senator Carl Marcellino, having delivered grants at both the federal and state level. UBS made a generous 5-year challenge grant of $250,000, which was matched by individual donors such as Charles Dolan, David Lerner, Marvin Sussman, and Billy Joel. The Long Island Philharmonic maintained an extensive Arts in Education program, entitled \\"Music LIvz\\". Among the programs the Philharmonic offered were Youth Concerts, In-school performances, Master Classes, the Young Artist Competition, and Orchestra at Work. Beginning in 2011, the group stopped performing their regular subscription series, performing only their New Years Gala, educational programs and summer parks concerts. On February 8, 2016, an announcement was made that the group would permanently disband effective immediately. The failure of the organization has been ascribed to several factors, including the mergers and acquisitions of several of the banks that formed the bulk of its funding base, as well as the changing economy of Long Island and the proximity of New York City's better known arts organizations that attracted donor funds away from Long Island. Select musicians from the philharmonic will continue to run school programs.  Community acceptance  Despite its mission to offer the residents of Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk Counties a world-class performing arts organization, the Philharmonic suffered due to the region's proximity to the cultural attractions and institutions of New York City. Additionally, Long Island's expansive geography posed a problem for the orchestra. Because of the distances between Long Island's more rural East End locales and its more populous western suburban neighborhoods, the Long Island Philharmonic would routinely perform duplicate concert programs across two or three venues, most notably the 2242-seat Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at the CW Post Campus of Long Island University in Nassau County, and the Staller Center for the Arts at Stony Brook University, State University of New York in central Suffolk County. It was during the 1990-91 season (under director Marin Alsop) that the orchestra first established a presence in [western] Suffolk County at the 2200-seat Eugene Orloff Auditorium at Half Hollow Hills High School East in Dix Hills - and building upon the high attendance achieved at that venue, the following season it would find a permanent residency further east at the Staller Center in Stony Brook.  Long Island Philharmonic Chorus  From its beginning, the Long Island Philharmonic incorporated a choral element. At the time of its founding in 1979, Maestro Keene asked Frances Roberts, a local music teacher and accomplished vocal accompanist, to form a chorus. From that beginning, the Chorus was a regular part of the Long Island Philharmonic. The chorus consisted of 100 ‚Äì 150 amateur singers drawn from all walks of life. Many were musical professionals: music teachers, voice teachers and others, while many others are strictly amateurs. Despite this mix, the chorus regularly received critical acclaim. The orchestra generally scheduled at least one choral piece each year in its repertory.  Legacy  Maestro Keene was the Music Director of the New York City Operaduring this time and during his tenure became the General Director of the NY City Opera. Maestra Alsop has gone on to become one of the premiere female conductors in the world, leading both the Bournemouth Symphony and, most recently, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, thus becoming the first female full-time conductor of a major US orchestra.

It has been reprinted in magazines, translated, and anthologized numerous times, occasionally under the title \\"The Last Dawn\\". The story text is now out of copyright. \\"Finis\\" is the story of a new star that is discovered which turns out to be a new, hotter sun. It is a short, but hard hitting story which shows a man and woman who stay up the night to watch the expected new star arise. Though published in 1906, it is set in the future of the mid 20th century.  Synopsis  The story starts with two men and two women at an observatory in New York City. They are awaiting the appearance of a new star that has been predicted by top scientists that will rival the moon in intensity. The entire world is excited about this new heavenly body and people stay up the night waiting. It is February and very cold but around midnight the temperature starts to climb and the snow melts. Then a very bright moon rises, which is brighter than normal because it is reflecting the new star's light. Then the sky turns ablaze with color as the new sun is seen and the blast of heat is almost immediate. One of the women screams as a nearby flag catches fire. The city starts to go up in smoke and those directly in the heat quickly die. One of the men in the observatory flees with his wife and it is assumed that they die outside. The remaining man and woman quickly try to get to the cellar as the building they are in starts to collapse. The extreme heat has evaporated the sea water which now comes back as a torrential rain. The city starts to flood and a thick cloud of steam fills the air. The couple makes it down to the cellar and the heat is almost unbearable as they just lie on the floor going in and out of consciousness. Finally the rain stops and the heat starts to go up again but then the new sun goes down and darkness brings some coolness to them. They talk about their future and realize that when the new sun comes up the next morning, the heat will kill them and everyone left. They realize that they will be dead soon and have a last kiss. The sun then comes up and the world is burnt to a crisp.

Second Mizon mission Bretonnet entered in the navy by attending the √âcole Navale, the Navy Academy in charge of the education of the officers of the French Navy.√â. Gentil, p. 104 Among his first important mission was the participation in the second Mizon Mission in 1892; the expedition was commanded by lieutenant de vaisseau Louis Mizon, who under him Albert Nebout and Bretonnet as enseigne de vaisseau.Bulletin, (1956), p. 599 The expedition, that was to cover the territories between the Niger River and the Adamawa, was primarily designed to carve a French enclave on the Benue River in Northern Nigeria, a territory that the British claimed being theirs following the Berlin Conference. Ignoring the protests of the Royal Niger Company that Adamawa had been given to the British by the Berlin Conference, he hoisted the French flag in the region after a treaty with the Emir of Muri; unsupported by France, he was forced to leave the area with his men in 1893. Mission to Bussa In 1896, Bretonnet, by now promoted lieutenant, was given command of an expedition meant to establish French control on the navigable portions of the Niger River below Bussa, in modern Nigeria. These plans were opposed by the Royal Niger Company, claiming the English had already treaty rights on the region. Bretonnet left the French post of Carnotville, in Dahomey, on December 28, 1896 and headed north, penetrating in the region of Borgu. Bretonnet passed by Kandi and entered in Illo, where he placed a Resident; then, pointing south, he arrived at Bussa, whose emir Kisan Dogo was involved in a bitter feud with Kibari, ruler of Wawa, that supported a rival claimant to the throne of Bussa. In exchange for the promise of helping Kisan Dogo in removing Kibari and replacing him with a relative of his, Bretonnet held Bussa \\"in the name of the French Republic\\" claiming to \\"occupy effectively the territory of Bussa\\".Pakenham, Thomas (1992). The Scramble for Africa. Abacus. pp. 515‚Äì516. . The latter claim was far from true: Kwara, a son of the king of Wawa that Bretonnet had helped to overthrow, guided a rebellion that extended to vast areas of Borgu. Bretonnet was forced to move from one place to another: first at Kandi, then at Illo to help his Resident, then to Bussa to support the emir. A big battle was fought at More, where 1,500 rebels gathered: Bretonnet and Kisan Dogo were victorious, but the Lieutenant lost one of his Europeans in the battle, the Resident of Illo, Carrerot. It was only by 1898 that the French had completely subdued the rebellion. News of Bretonnet's occupation of Bussa created uproar in London, when the British learned of the situation in April. The French and English governments, after long discussions, reached a compromise that was sanctioned on June 14, 1898 by the Anglo-French Convention; Bretonnet evacuated Bussa, Illo and Gomba, but for purely commercial purposes Great Britain agreed to lease to France two small plots of land on the river - the one on the right bank between Leaba and the mouth of the Moshi River, the other at one of the mouths of the Niger. By accepting this line Great Britain abandoned Nikki and a great part of Borgu as well as some part of Gando to France. Death at Togbao In the same year Bretonnet's former roommate at the naval academy, Captain √âmile Gentil, who had just returned from his mission to Lake Chad, persuaded the government to give him command of an expedition that would provide to solve the issues that Gentil's departure had left open, and prepare the ground for Gentil's future mission. On October 10 Bretonnet left France, with his second Lt. Solomon Braun; news arrived shortly after that Rabih az-Zubayr, the greatest ruler in the Chad Basin, had attacked Baguirmi, whose king was a French prot√©g√©. In France, the government reacted by ordering reinforcements to be sent to Bretonnet, and the preparations for the Gentil Mission were accelerated. Bretonnet was advised to reach the Chari River and unite his forces with those of the Baguirmians. On June 15 Bretonnet reached the French post of Kouno on the Chari, having with him only half a hundred Senegal riflemen and two officers, but also three cannons, and was shortly after met by Gaourang, the king of Baguirmi, with 400 men. Bretonnet wrote a letter, on July 8, to Gentil, whose expedition had arrived in Middle Congo and was not very distant, in which he wrote that he did not trust the rumours that Rabih in person was marching on Kouno, but all the same asked Gentil to send him Captain Julien with his 130-strong company.√â. Gentil, La chute de l'empire de Rabah, p. 570 The letter arrived in Gentil's hands when it was already too late; Rabih was effectively marching on Kouno at the head of 2,700 men with firearms and 10,000 auxiliaries. With the enemy approaching, Bretonnet evacuated Kouno and entrenched himself in the nearby hills of Togbao; here on July 17 took place the battle with Rabih's forces, in which Bretonnet, Braun and all his men were massacred, except for three wounded Senegalese that were taken prisoners. One of these escaped, and informed on August 16 Gentil of Bretonnet's death.√â.

Currently in three distinct segments, when completed, it will traverse the state in a southeasterly direction from Virginia to South Carolina, connecting the cities of Winston-Salem, High Point, Asheboro, Rockingham, and Lumberton. Route description As of September 27, 2018, there is a total of of I-74, broken in three segments across the state: Mount Airy, the Piedmont Triad and Laurinburg areas. Piedmont Triad Pilot Mountain can be seen in the background. The first section of I-74 begins at the Virginia state line (overlapped with I-77 for approximately . After separation, it goes east and connects to US 52 near Mount Airy, where the first section ends. I-74 is to be routed along US 52 from Mount Airy to Bethania, where it will then separate onto the new Winston- Salem Northern Beltway and go east around Winston-Salem before connecting to existing I-74 south of Kernersville. Under a new accelerated construction plan for the Beltway, right-of-way acquisition began in 2012 and construction started in December 2014. Until construction is completed, travelers wanting to connect between the first and second section of I-74 should stay on US 52 through downtown Winston-Salem, and then take I-40 East to I-74 East towards High Point. I-73/I-74/US 220, near Asheboro The second section of I-74 extends from the intersection with I-40 in Southeastern Winston-Salem to High Point. Until January 2019, this section of I-74 was concurrent with US 311. This section was designated despite not having 10-foot shoulders, with the promise that shoulders would be widened later. Signs were installed by August 2014. This section connects directly to another section, called the High Point East Belt. It connects High Point with both I-85 Business and I-85. Construction completed on June 7, 2013 extended the freeway an additional 8 miles to US 220/I-73 at mile marker 86 in Randleman. The highway was originally to be completed by October 2012. I-74 joins with I-73/US 220 South in Randleman going south to Asheboro. The freeway is already completed, but was not allowed to be signed as a full Interstate until the segment through Asheboro was upgraded to Interstate Highway standards in December 2013. The fourth section of I-74 (and I-73) starts along a bypass of Asheboro where a project to improve US 220 to Interstate standards was completed, and Interstate signs went up in 2012. I-74 continues concurrently with I-73 and US 220 between I-73 mile markers 68-42 (), the first section marked as I-74 (and I-73) in North Carolina in 1997. It continues south bypassing the towns of Seagrove, Biscoe and Candor. Visitor centers (completed in 2010) are located eastbound and westbound at mile marker 61. After Exit 41 U.S. 220 leaves the freeway, the route continues as I-73, I-74 for another towards Rockingham. Though this part of I-73/I-74 was completed in 2008 and is up to Interstate standards, it was initially signed as a future Interstate route because it had not been accepted into the Interstate Highway System by the FHWA by the time it was opened, necessitating the posting of future shields. This situation was remedied on July 7, 2011 when the FHWA approved the addition of this segment to the Interstate Highway System. The route was finally signed as Interstates 73 and 74 in the fall of 2013. I-73/I-74/US 220, near Biscoe Sandhills At Rockingham, Future I-73 and I-74 will separate from current US 220 along a to-be-built bypass around the west of the city and then join the existing US 74 bypass freeway, which goes south around Rockingham and Hamlet. The first section of the Bypass, four miles of upgraded US 220, is under construction with a planned completion date of March 2018. Future I-73 ends near the NC 38 exit where it is planned to be routed south into South Carolina. Future I-74 continues to the end of the freeway. Between Hamlet and Laurinburg is an at- grade expressway that will eventually be upgraded to Interstate standards. At Laurinburg, I-74 is to use the Laurinburg Bypass was at the standard North Carolina freeway grade and signed as I-74 in 2008; however, NCDOT had to remove the signage the following year when FHWA ruled against using them until the freeway was up to Interstate standards. The third section of I-74 is officially named the American Indian Highway, completed in 2008, this () section stretches from Maxton to south of Lumberton, connecting with I-95/US 301. After NC 41, I-74 ends for the final time as the highway continues on as an at-grade expressway signed as US 74/Future I-74 Corridor. East of I-95 I-74/US 74 near the intersection with I-95 in Lumberton Future I-74 is to continue to follow US 74, going through the city of Whiteville and bypassing the town of Lake Waccamaw. While there are no funded projects to upgrade the entire highway to Interstate standards, NCDOT is funding several smaller projects to replace intersections with interchanges for several of the remaining cross streets, including for NC 72/NC 130 north of Boardman and replacing other intersections with grade separations, such as with Old US 74 near Evergreen over the next ten years. Before the town of Bolton, it will separate from US 74 onto a proposed new freeway towards Shallotte, then go west on the proposed extension of the Carolina Bays Parkway into South Carolina. This entire section of I-74 is still under a Feasibility Study with several possible routing options, it thus may take years before reaching South Carolina. Current NCDOT plans suggest that construction may not begin until after 2020, and that this will likely be the last section of I-74 to be completed. Alternate names Though the highway is commonly known as I-74 throughout the state, the highway does have other known names it uses locally in areas. * American Indian Highway‚Äîofficial name of the section of I-74 in Robeson County (mile marker 191-213). It is named to honor the large American Indian population in Robeson County. * Blue Star Memorial Highway‚Äîunofficial North Carolina honorary name of I-74 in Randolph County (dedicated on June 7, 2013). * High Point East Belt‚Äîroad name in Guilford County. History The Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 initially authorized the new high priority transportation corridor 5, tentatively known as I-73, to travel from Michigan to South Carolina. Because of several disputes to the routing, a compromise was reached in 1995, by Senator John Warner and Senator Lauch Faircloth, that extended I-74 from its then current eastern terminus of Cincinnati, Ohio, to overlap I-73. In Virginia, I-74 would follow I-77 into North Carolina, while I-73 would go east to Roanoke then south along US 220 towards Greensboro. However, when I-73 crossed a border between two states, the federal law authorizing the road required that the two states agree that their sections meet. Originally, both Carolinas selected a route running south from Rockingham, North Carolina. North Carolina had more money to spend on roads, though, and on May 10, 1995, the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved North Carolina's plan for I-73 to run eastward to the coast and enter South Carolina at North Myrtle Beach. Another compromise, between Senator Lauch Faircloth and Senator Strom Thurmond, agreed to have both interstates enter South Carolina: I-73 south of Rockingham and I-74 south of Wilmington. After later amendments and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century of 1996 (TEA-21), on July 25, 1996, AASHTO accepted Interstates 73/74 into the Interstate Highway System within the states of South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. Pine Ridge The portion from south of Steeds north to south of Ulah was completed August 27, 1996, and was the first road marked as I-74 (and I-73). Future signage was also installed north to the Greensboro area. The remainder of of existing and new freeway between Ulah and Candor was also signed as I-73/I-74 along US 220\\\\. In 1998, NC 752, a freeway spur of I-77 was renumbered as the segment of completed I-74, from I-77 to US 601\\\\. On June 30, 1999, the freeway was extended an additional to US 52, south of Mount Airy. In April 2001, I-74 was overlapped with I-77 from the Virginia state line to exit 101. In January 2008, an section of freeway was completed from Candor to Ellerbe; however, it was signed Future I-73/I-74. On November 22, 2010, a section (known as the East Belt) was added between North Main Street in High Point to Cedar Square Road near Glenola. This also includes the section of new freeway that opened between I-85 Business Cedar Square Road. On October 4, 2012, I-74 was extended west from High Point to I-40, in Winston-Salem. On June 7, 2013, I-74 extended east onto new primary routing from Cedar Square Road to I-73/US 220, near Randleman. Continuing in concurrency with I-73/US 220, it now connects two segments of the Interstate from Winston-Salem to Candor. American Indian Highway and Laurinburg Bypass On September 26, 2008, a section of I-74/US 74 was opened between Maxton to NC 41 near Lumberton, known as the American Indian Highway. The Laurinburg Bypass was also resigned I-74/US 74 at the same time. The following year the Laurinburg Bypass was removed of its I-74 designation by NCDOT, during the summer, after a ruling from the FHWA (it was re-signed as a Future I-74 Corridor). The reason was that the section, though a freeway by North Carolina standards, it was not up to Interstate standards. It was also at this same time that NCDOT fixed an exit number error along mile markers 181-191. North Carolina Highway 752 North Carolina Highway 752 (NC 752) was the designation of the four-lane limited access highway that traversed from I-77 to NC 89, near Pine Ridge. Established in 1994, it was a freeway spur. In 1998, the freeway was extended to US 601 and was renumbered as I-74. Its short four-year existence was simply to be a placeholder for I-74. Future Pilot Mountain Parkway From Mount Airy to Rural Hall, US 52 is planned to be upgraded to Interstate standards. However it is currently flagged \\"Scheduled for Reprioritization\\", with no estimated cost or date established. The section from Rockingham-Hamlet Bypass to Laurinburg Bypass is planned to be upgraded to Interstate standards. However it is currently flagged \\"Scheduled for Reprioritization\\", with no estimated cost or date established. When this section opened it was signed \\"Future I-74\\" but those signs were taken down in Fall 2016. A proposed new freeway in Columbus and Brunswick counties would traverse from Whiteville to the Carolina Bays Parkway in South Carolina. However it is currently flagged \\"Scheduled for Reprioritization,\\" with no estimated cost or date established. Winston- Salem Northern Beltway The Winston-Salem Northern Beltway is an under construction freeway loop around the North Carolina city of Winston-Salem. The western section has been designated as North Carolina Highway 452 (NC 452), which will later become I-274 when completed, and the eastern section of the beltway is designated as North Carolina Highway 74 (NC 74), which will later become part of I-74 when completed. On September 7, 2011, North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue announced that construction of a part of the eastern leg of the beltway would begin in 2014. The section to be built connects US 158 to I-40 Bus. (now US 421/Salem Parkway). Right-of-way acquisition began in 2012, and cost $34 million; construction was estimated to cost $156 million. Construction on the segment, Project U-2579B; commenced in December 2014, with an anticipated completion date of November 2018. However, after delays, including an opening date of fall 2019, it was finally opened to traffic on September 5, 2020. Since then, funding has been allocated to complete the remaining sections of NC 74 between US 52 and the current I-74 (formerly cosigned with US 311), starting with the segment between US 311 and US 158, known as Project U-2579C; in October 2017. Construction on this segment began in 2018, and is scheduled to open in 2021. That same year, a contract for the segment between NC 66 and US 311, Projects U-2579D, U-2579E, and U-2579F; was awarded,Next, construction on the segments between I-74 and US 421/Salem Parkway, Projects U-2579AA and U-2579AB; are scheduled to begin in 2020, and will open in 2024. Construction on the interchange with US 52, which began in 2019, is scheduled to be completed in 2022. Rockingham bypass A western bypass of Rockingham is planned, beginning at the partially-built trumpet interchange with US 220 where I-73 and I-74 currently end, and running southwest to the trumpet interchange between US 74 and US 74 Business, which will be reconfigured to accommodate the new bypass. Construction was initially scheduled for 2026, but was rescheduled for late 2019, and is planned to last three years, costing $146.1 million. Upon completion of the bypass, I-74 will be designated along its length and along US 74 around Rockingham and Hamlet, terminating east of Hamlet at US 74 Business. The bypass will also carry I-73, which will terminate at the interchange with US 74 west of Rockingham until the section of I-73 extending into South Carolina is completed.

She was affectionately known as Gandhi buri, Bengali for old lady Gandhi. Early life and involvement in the freedom movement Not much is known of her early life apart from that she was born in the small village of Hogla, near Tamluk in 1869, and that because she was the daughter of a poor peasant, she did not receive a formal education. She was married early and became widowed at the age of eighteen without bearing any offspring In 1905, she became actively interested in the Indian independence movement as a Gandhian. A notable feature of the freedom struggle in Midnapore was the participation of women. In 1932, she took part in the Civil Disobedience movement and was arrested for breaking the Salt Act. She was promptly released, but protested for the abolition of the tax. Arrested again, she was incarcerated for six months at Baharampur. After being released, she became an active member of the Indian National Congress and took to spinning her own Khadi. In 1933, she attended the subdivisional Congress conference at Serampore and was injured in the ensuing baton charge by the police. Involvement in the Quit India Movement As part of the Quit India Movement, members of the Congress planned to take over the various police stations of Medinipore district and other government offices. This was to be a step in overthrowing the British government in the district and establishing an independent Indian state. Hazra, who was 72 years at the time, led a procession of six thousand supporters, mostly women volunteers, with the purpose of taking over the Tamluk police station. When the procession reached the outskirts of the town, they were ordered to disband under Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code by the Crown police. As she stepped forward, Hazra was shot once. Apparently, she had stepped forward and appealed to the police not to open fire at the crowd. The Biplabi newspaper of the parallel Tamluk National Government commented: As she was repeatedly shot, she kept chanting Vande Mataram, \\"hail to the Motherland\\". She died with the flag of the Indian National Congress held high and still flying. Legacy Statue of Hazra on the Maidan at Kolkata The parallel Tamluk government incited open rebellion by praising her \\"martyrdom for her country\\" and was able to function for two more years, until it was disbanded in 1944, at Gandhi's request. India earned Independence in 1947 and numerous schools, colonies, and streets were named after Hazra. The first statue of a woman put up in Kolkata, in independent India, was Hazra's in 1977. A statue now stands at the spot where she was killed in Tamluk. In 2002, as part of a series of postage stamps commemorating sixty years of the Quit India Movement and the formation of the Tamluk National Government, the Department of Posts of India issued a five rupee postage stamp with Matangini Hazra's likeness.

The film centers around a teenager who is haunted by the ghost of his rock hero. It is the directorial debut of actor Charles Martin Smith, who has a cameo in the film. Plot High school outcast Eddie Weinbauer is writing a letter to his hero, heavy metal musician Sammi Curr. A vulgar and infamous superstar, Sammi is a hometown hero of Eddie's town, and an alumnus of Eddie's own Lakeridge High School. He puts the letter in an envelope and starts doing his chores. Watching the news at the same time, following a report on Sammi's being banned from returning to Lakeridge High to perform at the Halloween dance, Eddie is shocked to hear the worst words to ever reach his ears: Sammi Curr has died in a mysterious hotel fire. Eddie is completely devastated. He goes to his friend \\"Nuke\\", a radio DJ who knew Sammi Curr personally. To take Eddie's mind off the death of his idol, Nuke gives Eddie the only copy of Curr's last and as-yet unreleased album, \\"Songs in the Key of Death\\", on an acetate disc. Nuke has recorded the disc onto high quality tape and plans to play it in its entirety on-air at midnight on Halloween as a tribute since, according to Nuke, that was always Sammi's plan for the album's debut. Once back home, Eddie falls asleep while listening to the record and has a strange dream about the fire that killed Sammi Curr. When he wakes up he finds that the record is skipping and after listening to it for a few seconds he comes to realize that something is not quite right about the lyrics that the record is stuck on. Having previous experience with hidden lyrics, Eddie plays the record backwards, but receives more than he imagined: Sammi Curr speaking to him from beyond the grave. Sammi instructs Eddie on how to go about getting revenge on a group of bullies who make his school life a torment, since Sammi himself was bullied constantly in high school and he wants to now take the revenge on Eddie's bullies that he never got to take on his own. Eddie explains the situation to his best friend Roger, who is highly skeptical of the whole thing. At first the revenge is innocent enough, but before long the plans start to become more sinister, with the potential to cause real physical harm and eventually building towards murder. Having no desire to take things so far, Eddie determines to sever ties with the dead rocker, but Sammi has no intention of letting that happen. When Eddie is alone in his room, Sammi causes some soda to spill on the record, initiating an electrical surge that gives him just the amount of energy he needs to escape out of the record and become able to carry out his murderous plans without the help of another. Eddie smashes his record player and stereo system after a personal, face-to-face visit from Sammi, hoping to make sure he never sees the dead rocker in his room again. After Eddie‚Äôs cassette tape copy of the album puts his worst bully's girlfriend in the hospital simply from listening to it, Eddie recruits Roger to steal the tape out of the bully's car, and orders its destruction. Out of naivety and ignorance to the severity of the situation, Roger lies to Eddie about the tape's destruction and instead plays it on his own stereo system, earning Roger his own visit from Sammi Curr. Sammi orders Roger to play the tape of \\"Songs in the Key of Death\\" at the high school Halloween dance, or die. Roger does as he is told, and goes to the dance to play the tape over the PA system. Eddie learns of the tape being played, and quickly attempts to reach the school to stop Sammi from causing any more damage. When the live band takes the stage for their performance at the dance, however, Sammi literally explodes out of the lead singer's guitar amplifier and proceeds to steal the show. The delighted students think it is all a Halloween tribute to Sammi Curr, even as Sammi begins to fire electric bolts from the neck of his guitar, disintegrating audience members. After the first few deaths, however, panic erupts as the young revellers realize the danger is very real, and Sammi wreaks havoc as the dance attendees flee in terror. When Eddie reaches the school, ambulances and police cars surround the building. As he rushes to save Leslie he comes across Tim (Eddie‚Äôs bully). Eddie attempts to save Tim however Tim ignores him and is killed by Sammi. He eventually finds Leslie and the two try desperately to find the main circuit box. When they do Sammi attacks them, but before Sammi can kill them Roger knocks out the circuit box, cutting the school power and temporarily stopping Sammi. Eddie realizes that Sammi can only travel through radio signals. Eddie sets about destroying every radio he sees in an attempt to prevent Sammi from continuing his rampage, leading to a final confrontation between the young metal fan and his former idol. After reaching the radio station in a futile attempt to stop the midnight broadcast of Sammi's demonic album, Eddie succeeds in luring Sammi (in a cassette tape) into a police car and starts baiting him with insults until he breaks out and tries to attack Eddie from behind the car's security grill. Eddie drives on to an unfinished bridge and speeds over the edge, launching the car into a river, short-circuiting the tape and finally destroying the malevolent rocker. Cast *Marc Price as Eddie Weinbauer *Tony Fields as Sammi Curr *Lisa Orgolini as Leslie Graham *Doug Savant as Tim Hainey *Elaine Joyce as Angie Weinbauer, Eddie's Mother *Glen Morgan as Roger Mockus *Clare Torao as Maggie Wong-Hernandez (as Clare Nono) *Gene Simmons as Nuke (cameo) *Ozzy Osbourne as Rev. Aaron Gilstrom (cameo) *Alice Nunn as Mrs. Sylvia Cavell (cameo) *Charles Martin Smith as Mr. Wimbley (cameo) Production Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. was originally set to play Sammi Curr. Ozzy Osbourne plays a televangelist decrying the evils of heavy metal music. A film titled Lunch of the Dead is displayed on a cinema marquee. According to the IMDB, Lunch of the Dead does not exist as a movie, and therefore was an invention from the props department. Special effects for the film were created by Kevin Yagher, who would go on to provide the effects for such horror icons as Freddy Krueger and the Crypt Keeper from HBO's Tales from the Crypt. Yagher also had a cameo in the movie as the lead singer/guitarist for the band The Kickers, playing at the high school Halloween dance. Scenes at Eddie's school (the fictional \\"Lakeridge High School\\") were filmed at both Hoggard High Schoolhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092112/locations and New Hanover High School in Wilmington, North Carolina. Gene Simmons was originally offered the role of Sammi Curr, but did not think much of the script and ultimately agreed only to a cameo as radio DJ, Nuke. Simmons later said in an interview that he chose to play the role as a childhood hero of his, Wolfman Jack. The title of Sammi Curr's unreleased album Songs in the Key of Death is a play on the title of Stevie Wonder's 1976 album Songs in the Key of Life. Soundtrack All Sammi Curr music was composed by the band Fastway and composer Christopher Young. In the stack of records Eddie's mother looks at, the last LP is a copy of Megadeth's Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, with a cut corner. Normally, a record with cut corners denotes that it was a radio promo, or was for discounted sale only. The other records in the stack were also real releases. Included was a 4 song E.P. by U.S. heavy metal/horror rock band Impaler, Rise of the Mutants, and Canadian thrash metal band Exciter's 1986 LP Unveiling the Wicked and Savatage's 1984 release The Dungeons Are Calling. On the walls in Eddie's room, there are posters of Judas Priest, Anthrax, Raven, Twisted Sister, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Ozzy Osbourne, Poison, and KISS. A picture of the band Lizzy Borden.. On his locker door in school there is also a sticker with Lizzy Borden. Co-composer Christopher Young went on to compose music for the films Hellraiser, Hellbound: Hellraiser II, The Gift, Urban Legend, Ghost Rider, Spider-Man 3, Drag Me to Hell and The Uninvited. Release The film was released theatrically in the United States by De Laurentiis Entertainment Group in October 1986. It grossed $6,797,218 at the box office. It was released on VHS by Lorimar Home Video the following year. The film was released on DVD in the United States by Platinum Disc Corporation in 2002.

He was also a psychiatrist and a successful writer in the fields of both psychiatry and Sufi mysticism. Life Iran Nurbakhsh was born in the city of Kerman, Iran on 10 December 1926. He was initiated into the Nimatullahi Sufi order at the age of sixteen and appointed its sheikh at twenty. Nurbakhsh studied at University of Tehran's medical school, receiving his doctorate in psychiatry in 1952, from the Sorbonne. He began his professional career as a medical doctor at the age of 26 when he became head of a local hospital in the southeastern town of Bam, Iran. In the following year he succeeded his master, Mo'nes 'Ali Shah Zo'r-Riyasateyn, as master of the Nimatullahi, taking the Sufi sobriquet of Nur 'Ali Shah. As well as his revival of the Nimatullahi Sufi Order and his many written works, Nurbakhsh became one of Iran's foremost psychiatrists. Nurbakhsh believed that all are equal in love. According to his obituary in Payvan's Iran news, he \\"promoted the creed of fraternity and equality of all human beings, regardless of gender, race, nationality and religion.\\" Emigrating to the West Nurbakhsh left Iran following the Iranian revolution in 1979, first for the United States, where he established several Sufi centers known as khanaqahs, then moved to Britain in 1983 and settled there. Dr. Nurbakhsh's work in reviving and organizing Sufism through the Nimatullahi order continued until his death in Britain in 2008. Career Psychiatry After obtaining his psychiatric degree from the Sorbonne, Nurbakhsh was appointed professor of psychiatry at the Tehran University school of medicine, a position which he held until he retired, along with that of director of the Iranian Medical Council, president of the Iranian Association of Psychiatrists, and head of the Ruzbeh Psychiatric Hospital. He was also an honorary member of the American Psychiatrists' Association. Nurbakhsh also supervised the World Congress of Psychiatry for the World Psychiatric Association when it was for first hosted in Iran. He produced 37 scientific works in the field of psychiatry, as author, editor and translator, along with many articles in scientific journals and a compendium of instructional brochures for the use of researchers, professors and students. Sufism According to the Islamic scholar Henry Corbin, Nurbakhsh was known for his \\"prodigious activity\\" . The author, Henry Corbin, said that \\"At present, the khanaqah-i ni'matullahi has Dr. Davad Nuraksh as its 'pole', a man of prodigious activity.\\" in the publication of classical Sufi texts. By 1979, when he left Iran, he had published some eighty books. He wrote the two part article What is Sufism? Sufism and Psychoanalysis, published in The International Journal of Social Psychiatry, which fall into the category of Sufi psychology, bringing together his twin interests in the fields of Sufism and psychiatry. Prior to 1979, according to biographical material on the Order's web site, \\"he established 70 Sufi centres in most of the major cities and towns of Iran, all set up as charitable organisations according to civil and Islamic law. A great number of these have since been expropriated under the current regime.\\" The first of the Order's Sufi centres outside Iran was set up in San Francisco in 1975. Many more were set up outside Iran after his flight into exile in 1979. Death and succession Nurbakhsh died in his retreat in the English countryside near the town of Banbury, Oxfordshire, where he spent his final years, and is buried there. He has been succeeded by his son, Alireza Nurbakhsh, a doctor in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin and a practising lawyer in London. His Sufi sobriquet is Reza 'Ali Shah. He is survived by his widow, Parvaneh Daneshvar Nurbakhsh, three sons, and two daughters. Selected Statements by Nurbakhsh on Sufism > The basis of Sufism is consideration of the hearts and feelings of others. > If you haven't the will to gladden someone's heart, then at least beware > lest you hurt someone's heart, for on our path, no sin exists but this. > Sufism is a path towards the Truth where there are no provisions except > Love. Its method is to look solely in one direction, and its objective is > God. > True lovers prefer the Beloved's desires to their own, being content with > whatever the Beloved desires - 'be it cure or pain, union or separation.' > ... if you encounter a human being who claims to be a Sufi and behaves > contrary to the human code of ethics, do not ask, \\"What kind of Sufi is > this?\\" Rather, it would be better to ask, \\"What kind of person would this > have been had he not been a Sufi? > The capital of the Path is, in truth, nothing other than sincerity. > Sincerity has been defined as \`showing yourself as you really are' and > \`being inwardly what you show yourself to be'.

In 1891, the Swedish-Danish-Russian Joint-Stock Company signed a contract to provide service to Moscow for 18 years. Progress continued apace. In 1987 the network was converted to electronic switching. In 1994 the Moscow City Telephone Network was structured into a joint stock company. A majority stake is held by Mobile TeleSystems. On November 2013 it was reported that the company chose four suppliers of main and distribution of fiber optic cables for the development of optical fiber cables network until 2016 volume of purchases made more than 1 billion rubles. Earlier that month the company announced rebranding and new positioning of the company as a multi-service operator, to create a single digital platform of Moscow. In 2014, the operator will complete the construction of digital technology platform based on fiber networks to buildings (FTTx) and will provide all users access to a package of services, including broadband Internet access (broadband), digital TV and telephony. By late 2013 The company has built about 25 thousand kilometers connecting 650,000 households in Moscow. On January 2014 it was reported that the Moscow Government plans to revoke MGTS monopoly on public telephones, which the company had since 1994, and to select new operator that will add a completely new device features, such as parking fees payment option.

He served as the head football coach at Beloit College (1915), Monmouth College (1916‚Äì1917), and the University of Georgia (1920‚Äì1922), compiling a career college football coaching record of 29‚Äì17‚Äì6. At Georgia, Stegeman was also the head basketball coach (1919‚Äì1931), head baseball coach (1919‚Äì1920), and head track and field coach (1920‚Äì1937). Early years and playing career Stegeman was born and raised in Holland, Michigan, and was of Dutch descent. He attended the University of Chicago, where he starred in many sports, including track and field and football under the direction of the legendary Amos Alonzo Stagg. Stegeman played on the school's 1913 National Championship football squad, and was hailed by his coach, Stagg, as one of the finest athletes he had ever had the privilege of coaching. After playing football for another season in 1914, Stegeman graduated from Chicago with a Bachelor of Philosophy (Ph.B.) in 1915. Coaching career During the end of World War I, the United States Army stationed Stegeman in Athens to create physical training courses for the UGA Reserve Officers' Training Corps program. After arriving, he was hired by UGA's football coach, W. A. Cunningham, as an assistant for the 1919 season. When Cunningham returned to the Army after that season, Stegeman became the head coach of the football team and served in the position from 1920 to 1922. In addition, he also became the head coach of the basketball, baseball and track and field teams in 1920. His career football record stands at 20‚Äì6‚Äì3 (.741). He stepped down as baseball coach after one year. After the 1922 football season, Stegeman stepped down from that position to become the UGA athletics director. He remained as head coach of the basketball and track and field teams. As head coach of the Georgia basketball team from 1920 until 1931, he still owns the second-best winning percentage (.686) of any Georgia coach with more than 50 games. His final group of Bulldogs won 23 of 25 games and Stegeman was regarded by many as one of the first great basketball \\"gurus.\\" Stegeman coached UGA's track and field team for 17 years and was the personal coach of Forrest \\"Spec\\" Towns, who won a gold medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Stegeman led the UGA track team to its only SEC men's team conference championship in 1937 with Towns as the star of the squad. Later life and honors In 1946, Stegeman Hall was named in honor of Stegeman and initially served as the home of the University's athletic and physical education departments; however, that building was demolished in the early 1990s in preparation for events hosted by UGA during the 1996 Summer Olympics. As a result, Charles Knapp, UGA's president at the time, led the effort to rename Georgia Coliseum as Stegeman Coliseum in Stegeman's honor on March 2, 1996. Stegeman died of a heart attack in Athens, Georgia in 1939.

On the appointed day and at an auspicious time, the Kumbha is bathed with the charged and sanctified holy waters in the sacrificial pot and, by a mystic process, these pranic powers trickle down a silver wire and enter the deity installed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. The deity, which was until then only a granite sculptured stone image, is believed to transform into a vibrant and vivid living representation of the deva with innate beatitude, grace and grandeur, conferring divine blessings on all devotees. Ashtabandhanam Vedic yaj√±a at Vishnu Kunda according to Vaikhanasas' agamashastra as part of Kumbhabhishekam at Gunjanarasimhaswamy Temple, T. Narsipur Ashta means 8 in Sanskrit and Bandhanam means tying or fixing. Ashtabandhanam is the process of affixing an icon to its pedestal (peetham) with a clay-like paste made of 8 specific herbs mixed with wood lac, limestone powder, resin, red ochre, beeswax and butter. The paste is formed into long rolls about 2 cm thick and applied directly around the base of the icon, so that the cemented joints become watertight. This process is believed to keep the icon rejuvenated for a period of 12 years. When the Bandhanam is performed with gold (Swarnabandhanam), the rejuvenating power of the deity is believed to last for a period of 100 years. The '''Ashtabandhanam' paste is pliable like rubber. Through repeated interactions with abhishekha dravyams - materials used to bathe the icon during daily worship like water, milk, buttermilk, sandal paste and oils - and atmospheric oxidants, the paste loses its flexibility, becomes rigid and gets riddled with a lot of fissures. Through these fissures, the abhisheka dravyams percolate and attack the Yantra embedded under the peetham, obliterating the Bijaksharamantras -- mantras of sacred syllables (bija) -- that are inscribed on the Yantra, and this is believed to contribute to the lowering of the pranic spiritual power of the deity with the passage of time.

In May 2000, Gosper was criticized after his daughter Sophie was made the first Australian torchbearer in a late change over the previously selected Greek-Australian Yianna Souleles. At age 11, Sophie Gosper was too young by one year to carry the torch in Australia, but was invited by the Hellenic Olympic Committee to be the second carrier of the Olympic flame in Greece. Gosper apologized days later due to public outrage, though he insisted he was not involved in the decision. He was accused of being an \\"apologist for dictators\\" after his criticism of pro-democracy protesters during the Beijing 2008 torch relay. He suggested that during the Olympic Torch Australian appearance Chinese para- military torch attendants could be called into action if Australian police were unable to cope with potential protests. His remarks prompted a swift rebuke from Australian Attorney-General Robert McClelland.

It also refers to the eponymous band formed by Watson, whose blend of cabaret pop and classical music influences with indie rock has been compared to Rufus Wainwright, Andrew Bird, Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley and Pink Floyd for its experimental musicianship. Patrick Watson's album Close to Paradise was awarded the Polaris Music Prize in 2007.  Early history  Born in Lancaster, California to Canadian parents and raised in Hudson, Quebec, Watson attended Lower Canada College. While living in Hudson, Watson worked as a pool and hot tub water analyst at Piscines et Spas Hudson. He began his musical career in high school as a member of a ska band called Gangster Politics. Patrick Watson studied music at Vanier College in Montreal.  Solo career  Watson singing through a megaphone, used to warp and loop his voice, during a performance in 2009. Watson co-wrote and performed on several songs on The Cinematic Orchestra's 2007 album Ma Fleur including the opening track \\"To Build a Home\\". His \\"Missing Home\\" remix of Champion's \\"Guy Doune\\", from Champion's 2006 album The Remix Album, reached Number 1 on CBC Radio 3's R3-30 chart in early 2007. Watson has toured with several artists, including John Cale, The Cinematic Orchestra, Cold War Kids, Amon Tobin, The Dears, Feist and James Brown. He was Starbucks \\"Pick of the week\\" free download in September 2009 and then again in June 2015.  Patrick Watson (band)  After creating music and releasing albums in various styles, Watson formed a group with guitarist Simon Angell, percussionist Robbie Kuster, and bassist Mishka Stein. The band has performed with artists like James Brown, The Dears, Philip Glass and The Stills. In an interview, Watson said regarding his band: The band received a nomination for New Artist of the Year at the 2007 Juno Awards. On July 10, 2007, Close to Paradise made the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. It was announced as the winning album on September 24. Their 2009 album Wooden Arms was a finalist for the 2009 prize. The band is well known for using unusual objects to make sounds in their music; for example, Watson \\"played\\" a bicycle in the studio for the song \\"Beijing\\". and percussionist Robbie Kuster used two spoons to create a tremolo picking effect on an acoustic guitar in the opening of \\"Man Like You\\". After several years of touring internationally‚Äîincluding shows in regions as distant as Beijing with Split Works in 2010, the group returned to Montreal in 2011 to record their fourth studio album, Adventures in Your Own Backyard, which was released internationally in April 2012. The album marks a subtle shift in the band's style to a simpler and less experimental sound, described by one critic as \\"a dreamy bath of chamber-pop and fancy cabaret, less clacky without the kitchen- utensil or bike-wheel percussion of Wooden Arms and slightly more grounded than Close to Paradise\\". Prior to the album's release, the band performed at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, where they were named by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the 25 \\"can't-miss acts\\" of the festival. The band toured in support of the new album from April to July 2012. In September 2013, Watson created a T-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Cape Farewell, an organization which aims to instigate cultural awareness of climate change. Love Songs for Robots, the band's fifth studio album, was released on May 12, 2015. Wave, the band's sixth album, was released on October 18th, 2019. This album marked a departure of the band's longtime percussionist Robbie Kuster. Kuster, along with bassist Mishka Stein, created a new musical act, Black Legary. They also are part of another new act, Colonel Sun.

He made his debut on 26 September 1931 in a First Division match at Anfield. Grimsby Town F.C. were the visitors and were comfortably beaten 4‚Äì0. Savage scored twice, in the 66th and 82nd minutes (Gordon Hodgson also scored twice, in the 26th and 85th minutes). Savage was able to get the chance to score the goals as he was played in the forward line instead of his usual position of wing-half. The two strikes against Grimsby were the only goals he would score during his time at Liverpool. In fact, Savage struggled to hold down a starting role for the Anfield club, his best seasons were the 1934‚Äì35 and 1935‚Äì36 seasons where he played in 54 of the 84 matches, 27 in each season. Although Savage was mainly used as a 'bit part' player during other campaigns, he put together 105 appearances, 100 of which were in the league.

It was the first school in the United States to offer a free education to African-American children. It also served the non-orphan children of free people of color (\\"gens de couleur libre\\"), who paid a modest tuition. It operated as a distinct entity until 1915. Founding The school was financed from a trust established in the will of Madame Marie Couvent, the African-American widow of Bernard Couvent, one of the most commercially successful free men of color in New Orleans. The concept of educating African-Americans was opposed by some members of the white community in New Orleans, and the establishment of the trust for the school was challenged in court. The widow died in 1837, and when the original executor of the will failed to forcefully implement its terms, a group of ten leading Afro-Creole intellectuals residing in New Orleans formed The Catholic Institute for the Instruction of Indigent Orphans. This group successfully sued in court to obtain control of the widow's estate. The courts did not finally rule in favor of this group until 1846. The charter authorizing the Institute Catholique to function as a corporation was received from the state of Louisiana in 1847, and the school opened in 1848, renting facilities in the Fauborg Marigny suburb just east of the French Quarter while awaiting construction of a permanent building on the land donated by Madame Couvent. Felice Coulon Cailloux, wife of Andre Cailloux, later a hero in the American Civil War, initially served as the principal of the school while it operated in temporary quarters. By 1850, the city of New Orleans had a population of approximately 150,000. Of this population, 15,000 were free people of color, and 15,000 were slaves. The city had a three tier social structure, at the top of which were free whites, in the middle were free people of color, and at the bottom were slaves. Free people of color could own property, own businesses, and enter contracts, but could not vote, marry whites, or send their children to the public schools of the city, which were established in 1841. This rankled the French inspired republican idealism of the Afro-Creole intelligentsia, many of whom had been educated in France. The permanent building of the Institute Catholique was completed in 1852. The Afro-Creole poet Armand Lanusse (1810‚Äì1867), editor and contributor to Les Cenelles, a book of French poetry written by Afro-Creoles, who had been instrumental in the founding of the school and was one of the ten original Board Members, was named headmaster in 1852. He continued in that capacity until his death in 1867. Andre Cailloux and his wife, Felicie Coulon Cailloux, were active supporters of the school throughout the 1850s, sending all three of their surviving children there for instruction. Felicie continued to work at the Institute for several years after Lanusse became headmaster, and was responsible for the well being of the 75 young orphan girls who attended. Though the school's property and building were provided for in the will of Madame Couvent, the income generated from the real estate included in her estate was insufficient to cover annual operating expenses. The gap was made up through charitable contributions from several mutual aid societies established within the gens de couleur Afro-Creole community of New Orleans. The Friends of Order, an Afro-Creole mutual aid society of which Cailloux was a member, organized an annual contribution collected by its members at the cemeteries of New Orleans each year on All Soul's Day (November 2). Other mutual aid societies held annual charity balls. Occasionally, the school received small appropriations from the City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana. Average annual enrollment during the 1850s was approximately 300. Post bellum The school continued in operation after the American Civil War. In 1866, Harper's New Monthly Magazine contained a positive story about the school, its teachers, and its students. During this period, the Institute Catholique maintained its position as the intellectual center of the Afro- Creole community of New Orleans. All of the faculty members were Afro-Creoles, many of whom were educated in France. Paul Trevigne (1824‚Äì1907), editor of the French language Afro-Creole newspaper L'Union (1862‚Äì1864), a publication that advocated abolition and complete equality for African-Americans and the first African-American owned and operated newspaper in the American South, was a teacher there for 40 years. In 1893, when Afro-Creole philanthropist Thomy LaFon, the financial backer of the famous Plessey v. Ferguson lawsuit, died, he left a bequest to the school in his will for the construction of a new building. Arthur Esteves, President of the Board of Directors of the Institute Catholique, was one of the men who brought the Plessey vs. Ferguson lawsuit into litigation. Twentieth century In 1915, that school was destroyed by a hurricane. Lacking funds to rebuild, the Board of the Institute Catholique agreed to terms proposed by Sister Katharine Drexel, founder of Xavier University. She offered to build and operate a new school on the site, under the name St. Louis School of Holy Redeemer parish on the condition that it would be operated by the Sisters of the Holy Ghost. At the same time, a church, the Holy Redeemer Church, was built in the neighborhood, and the school, commonly referred to as Holy Redeemer, operated as an elementary school for the local parish. During this period, the teachers of the school no longer formed the intellectual center of the Afro-Creole community. In effect, though a school continued to operate at the location, the Institute Catholique, operated and staffed by African-Americans, ceased to exist. Ernest \\"Dutch\\" Morial, the first African-American (Afro-Creole) Mayor of New Orleans, attended Holy Redeemer Elementary School during this period. In 1965 Hurricane Besty destroyed the Holy Redeemer Church, but the Holy Redeemer Elementary School continued to operate. Graduates of that elementary school included the author Keith Weldon Medley, whose book on the Plessy vs. Ferguson lawsuit was published in 2003. The school continued in operation until 1993, when it closed due to lack of funds. That same year, the Bishop Perry Middle School for Boys, a free school operated by the Roman Catholic Church's Society of St. Edmund opened on the site. The school served students in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, primarily of African-American heritage. Enrollment ranged from 60 to 200 students. Today Bishop Perry was forced to shut down its operations in August, 2006, a victim of the economic losses of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, some of the families of students did not return to New Orleans after the evacuation caused by the Hurricane Katrina flooding. The building itself did not suffer great damage from the storm and subsequent flooding. From its founding in 1846 until today, the school and its successors have been located at 1941 Dauphine Street in New Orleans. Four buildings have been located on the lot, the last of which was built in 1956. The building is owned by the Diocese of New Orleans, and was rented from the Diocese by the Society of St. Edmund during the 12 years it operated Bishop Perry Middle School. In October, 2006, the building became home to the St. Gerard Majella Alternative School. Operated by the Society of the Sisters of Notre Dame, this alternative school is designed to provide ongoing education to young women of high school age who are pregnant.

He served as the head football coach at Northwestern University from 1947 to 1954, compiling a record of 33‚Äì39‚Äì1. Voigts led the 1948 Northwestern Wildcats team to the Rose Bowl, the first in school history, where they defeated California, 20‚Äì14. Voigts was a native of Evanston, Illinois, where Northwestern's main campus is located. He attended Northwestern and played on the school's football team between 1936 and 1938. In his sophomore year, the Wildcats won the Big Ten Conference, and Voigts was named an All-American tackle. After college, Voigts served as an assistant football coach and head basketball coach at Illinois Wesleyan University before moving briefly to Yale University, where he was a football line coach. He entered the U.S. Navy during World War II in 1942 and was stationed outside of Chicago where he met Paul Brown, the head coach of the base's football team. When Brown became head coach of the Cleveland Browns after the war, he hired Voigts as a tackle coach. After a year with the Browns, Voigts became head coach at Northwestern. Voigts resigned as Northwestern's head coach in 1955, citing growing criticism of his coaching after a string of losing seasons. He left football but stayed in Evanston, where he ran a real estate business for 30 years. He died in 2000. Early life and college Voigts grew up in Evanston, Illinois and attended Northwestern University, based in his home town. He played tackle on the school's football team starting as a sophomore in 1936. That year, the Northwestern Wildcats posted a 7‚Äì1 win-loss record under coach Pappy Waldorf and were champions of the Big Ten Conference, a grouping of large schools from the Midwestern United States. Voigts was selected by news outlets as an All-American. He was named to an all-Big Ten squad after his senior year in 1938 and played in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League champions and a selection of the country's best college players. Voigts also played on Northwestern's basketball team. Coaching career Voigts became head coach of the basketball team at Illinois Wesleyan University in 1939 and was co- coach of the football team alongside Don Heap. In two years at the school, Voigts's basketball teams posted a 25‚Äì16 win-loss record. Voigts in 1941 became a line coach for the Yale Bulldogs football team at Yale University. After one season at Yale, Voigts entered the U.S. Navy during World War II. He was stationed at Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside of Chicago and served as a line coach on the base's Bluejackets football team from 1942 to 1943. When the war ended, Paul Brown, who had been head football coach at Great Lakes, hired Voigts as a tackle coach for the Cleveland Browns, a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) that was to start play in 1946. He joined the Browns in March 1945, making him the first assistant signed by the team. Voigts coached tackles Lou Rymkus and Lou Groza as the Browns won the first AAFC championship in 1946. He stayed in Cleveland for only one season, however, accepting the head coaching job at Northwestern in February 1947. He signed a three-year contract, succeeding his old coach Waldorf. At 31 years old, he was one of the youngest men ever hired to coach a Big Ten football team. Voigts spent eight seasons at Northwestern, during which his teams compiled a 33‚Äì39‚Äì1 record. This ranks him sixth all-time among Northwestern football coaches in total wins and 12th in winning percentage. His most successful year was his second season, when the Wildcats finished with an 8‚Äì2 record and won the Rose Bowl 20‚Äì14 over a University of California, Berkeley team coached by Waldorf. It was Northwestern's first-ever bowl victory, and remained the only one in the school's history until the Wildcats won the 2013 Gator Bowl game in Jacksonville, Florida. Northwestern ended the season ranked seventh in the AP Poll of the best college teams in the country. Through his entire career at Northwestern, Voigts was an assistant coach in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual matchup between the champion of the National Football League and a selection of the best college players from around the country. While Voigts's tenure at Northwestern started successfully, he came under increasing pressure in the early 1950s after posting a string of losing records. He resigned in February 1955, citing his failure to put together winning teams. \\"It was just an increasing amount of criticism over my coaching, and it was probably hurting the school so I just quit\\", he said at the time. He said he had \\"no future plans\\" and had not considered whether he would return to pro football. He is sixth among Northwestern coaches in total wins and 12th in winning percentage. Lou Saban, a former Browns lineman who had served as assistant to Voigts, replaced him as head coach. Later life and death Voigts stayed in Evanston after resigning and operated a real estate business out of an office across the street from Northwestern's Dyche Stadium for 30 years. He died in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, Illinois in 2000 following a long illness. Northwestern in 2004 started the Bob Voigts Coach of the Year award, given to the best head coach at the school as selected by other coaches.

Mitchell won a silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics, and also won one gold, two silver, and one bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games in 1978 and 1982.  Early competition  Commencing in athletics at the relatively late age of seventeen, he joined the Waverley Athletics Club in Melbourne in 1972 with the aim of improving his fitness before the following rugby union season. After two seasons with Waverley, Mitchell met coach Norm Osborne, who coached at St Stephens Harriers. He transferred to St Stephens and they would work as coach and athlete for the remainder of Mitchell's career. At age nineteen Mitchell placed second in the Australian 400-metre title in 1974 when five days too old to contest the junior title in a time of 47.7s and things looked promising. However, he was to miss the next full offseason build-up following a bout of glandular fever and despite lowering his personal best to 46.8s at the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season, Mitchell placed second again to Steven Gee from New South Wales. The following offseason in 1975 saw Mitchell complete his first dedicated build-up and he quickly emerged as the dominant Australian 400-metre runner during the following summer, defeating Gee for the first time in December 1975, before equalling the Australian record of 45.7s and claiming both the Victorian and Australian titles easily.  Career   First Olympics  Mitchell was chosen in the Australian team for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and in a competition notable for disappointing Australian performances, he reached the Olympic Final on his international debut, finishing 6th in an Australian record. Two years later Mitchell competed in his first 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where, in extremely windy conditions, and having to run four rounds of 400-metre races in 30 hours he proved too strong for his opponents, taking the individual 400-metre gold medal and anchoring the 4x400 metre relay team to third place.  Second Olympics  In 1979, Mitchell elected not to contest the World Cup, preferring to remain in Australia to build up for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow in similar fashion to the preparation he followed in 1975. He again dominated the domestic season, lowering the national 400-metre record on four occasions as well as winning the Victorian 200 / 400-metre sprint double and again claiming the national title. In that race Mitchell lowered the national record to 45.35s in demolishing a field where the runner up ran 46.80. Named as Australian team captain, Mitchell enjoyed good lead up form, winning at his first run after the national titles in Pisa, before defeating a strong, largely American field in Stuttgart and 1979 world 400 leader Harald Schmid of West Germany, in an Australian record time of 45.26. It was Mitchell's last competition prior to contesting the Olympics. In Moscow, he easily reached his second Olympic final. The race itself was won by Russian Viktor Markin in a European record of 44.60s (the fastest time in the world for three seasons), while Mitchell finished strongly to take the silver medal in 44.84s. This time was the 12th fastest in history (full electronic timing) and was a Commonwealth record. Third placegetter, Frank Schaffer of East Germany, produced the fastest time ever for third outside of the altitude influenced Olympics conducted in Mexico City in 1968. Mitchell's silver medal from Moscow remains the last individual men's running medal won at the Olympic Games by an Australian and the only track and field medal won by an Australian in an eastern bloc country. He then continued to race in Europe, where he frequently met American athletes who had not contested the Olympic Games following America's boycott of the meeting over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. However, Mitchell defeated all of the prominent Americans during this time. He remained unbeaten against Billy Mullins with whom he shared the equal second-fastest time of the year and was ranked second for the year over 400 metres by Track and Field News ahead of all American athletes. The following year, Mitchell accepted a position in England as the Area Manager - UK & Scandinavia for the Ansell Glove Company and athletics took a back seat. While in England, he competed for Haringey, and in 1982, moved to Lausanne, running for Stade Lausanne as part of late decision to defend his Commonwealth title at the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games scheduled for October that year. During that time, he won the Lausanne Grand Prix meeting from old rival Harald Schmid and later ran a Suisse record (for Swiss registered athletes) of 45.49. As well as being given the honour of carrying the Australian flag at the opening ceremony, Mitchell placed second behind Bert Cameron of Jamaica in the individual 400m final, and the Australian team also took silver behind England in the 4 √ó 400 m relay.  Final Olympics  Mitchell then elected to remain in Australia to prepare for one final attempt at the Olympics, however, his domestic season was disrupted by an achilles tendon injury which resulted in 7 weeks without running. To maintain fitness, he completed interval sessions running in a pool while wearing a life vest. By this time Australia had developed great depth in the 400m, and a solo (but officially timed) 4 √ó 400 m run on a Sunday morning by Peter Van Miltenberg, Bruce Frayne, Gary Minihan and Mitchell resulted in a new Australian record of 3:02.10. This time ensured that an Australian 4 √ó 400 m team would be going to the LA Games of 1984, where Mitchell was again named as Australian team captain. Prior to leaving for the Games, Mitchell's achilles injury had mended and his time trials were faster than those produced before the 1980 Olympics where he won the silver medal. However, his achilles problem re-emerged shortly after the team arrived in the US and his training was again disrupted. With Darren Clark also rapidly developing into a world class 400m runner, the Australian team looked strong and they ultimately reached the final. It is worth noting that Peter Van Miltenberg, who did not run in the final, played a significant part in helping them team to reach it through the qualifying stages. Mitchell believed that with Clark finishing 4th in the individual men's final, and Frayne narrowly missing the final despite a brilliant semi- final run, it was imperative that they run the first two legs in order for Australia to be well in the race from the outset and he convinced the team coaches to adopt that approach. The Australians led the US for almost 3 laps in front of their home crowd, however, with limited racing as a result of the achilles injury Mitchell was unable to hold out on the final leg as the USA took the gold medal from Great Britain and Nigeria, who both closed late to edge the Australians out of the medals. This was the first time in athletics history that four teams had broken the 3-minute barrier in the same race and Australia placed 4th in a new national record of 2:59.70, which still stands in 2018. It is one second faster than the Australian that finished second in the 4 √ó 400 m relay final at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. In 2012, Rick Mitchell was inducted into the Australian Athletics Hall of Fame.

Additives in Macromolecular Crystallization In macromolecular crystallography, the term additive is used instead of adjutant. An additive can either interact directly with the protein, and become incorporated at a fixed position in the resulting crystal or have a role within the disordered solvent, that in protein crystals constitute roughly 50% of the lattice volume. Polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and high-ionic strength salts such as ammonium sulfate and sodium citrate that induce protein precipitation when used in high concentrations are classified as precipitants, while certain other salts such as zinc sulfate or calcium sulfate that may cause a protein to precipitate vigorously even when used in small amounts are considered adjutants. Crystallization adjutants are considered additives when they are effective at relatively low concentrations.Additives for protein crystallization and concentration range The distinction between buffers and adjutants is also fuzzy. Buffer molecules can become part of the lattice (for example HEPES in Quantitative structure- activity relationship of human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) inhibitors using comparative molecular field analysis and X-ray structure analysis. becomes incorporated in crystals of human neutrophil collagenase) but their main use is to maintain the rather precise pH requirements for crystallization that many proteins have. Commonly used buffers such as citrate have a high ionic strength and at the typical buffer concentrations they also act as precipitants. Various species such as Ca2+ and Zn2+ are a biological requirement for certain proteins to fold correctly and certain co-factors are needed to maintain a well defined conformation. Certain strategies, like replacing precipitants and buffers with others intended to have a similar effect, have been used to differentiate between the roles played in protein crystallization by the various components in the crystallization solution. Additives for Membrane Protein Crystallization For membrane proteins, the situation is more complicated because the system that is being crystallized is not the membrane protein itself but the micellar system in which the membrane protein is embedded. The size of the protein-detergent mixed micelles are affected by both additives and detergents which will strongly influence the crystals obtained. In addition to varying the concentration of primary detergents, additives (lipids and alcohols) and secondary detergents can be used to modulate the size and shape of the detergent micelles. By reducing the size of the mixed micelles lattice forming protein-protein contacts are encouraged. Lipid cubic phases, spontaneous self-assembling liquid crystals or lipid mesophases have been used successfully in the crystallization of integral membrane proteins. Temperature, salts, detergents, various additives are used in this system to tailor the cubic phase to suit the target protein. Typical detergents used are n-dodecyl-Œ≤-d-maltopyranoside, n-decyl-Œ≤-d- glucopyranoside, lauryldimethylamine oxide LDAO, n-hexyl-Œ≤-d-glucopyranoside, n-nonyl-Œ≤-d-glucopyranoside and n-octyl-Œ≤-d-glucopyranoside; the various lipids are dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine and monoolein.

He obtained degrees from University of Victoria (B.A., M.A.) and the University of British Columbia (Ph.D.) He has edited one anthology of gay male pulp fiction, and co- edited an anthology of upcoming Canadian writers. The former collection highlights stories that represent lives outside the urban middle-class mainstream; the latter, featuring such acclaimed writers as Annabel Lyon, Steven Heighton, Camilla Gibb, Michael Turner, and Larissa Lai, aims to redress an absence the editors claim to have noticed in Canadian literature: sexually frank fiction.

National Plots: Historical Fiction and Changing Ideas of Canada, co- edited with Andrea Cabajsky, was published in 2010. The authors of the collection's fourteen essays explore the diverse ways that a wide range of historical fiction (published between 1850 and 2005) contributes to the formation of national identity. Co-edited with Gisele Baxter and Tara Lee, Blast, Corrupt, Dismantle, Erase: Contemporary North American Dystopian Literature takes NAFTA as a starting point; the volume's essayists interrogate the work of Canadian, American, and Mexican authors whose novels and short stories envision various North American realities through a dystopian lens. The second book of Grubisic's projected River Bend Trilogy, From Up River and For One Night Only is set over a six-month period in 1980-1 and describes the misadventures of two sets of siblings, high school students who decide to form a New Wave cover band and enter a Battle of the Bands contest. The Vancouver Sun reviewer described it as \\"filled with hope and exuberance\\" and \\"Lovingly and delightfully told, and completely without sentimentality, Grubisic's autobiographical novel is a long ode to youth, to unquenchable life and, yes, it's nostalgic but in the best possible way\\".

He also claims that he came to this dimension by using a portal which is now broken, and the only other one he knows of is supposed to be in a clock store. For each day he stays in this dimension, he will \\"age\\" one year, growing younger and younger until he turns into a baby and disappears. As he was a visibly old man when Yuri met him on the street, by his claim he would actually be very young. Yuri refuses to believe any of this and storms off. Over a week later, while Yuri is preparing to take her English test, she sees a small, sad boy watching her from outside the school. Yuri realizes his similarity to the old and young man, and that he would be the right age if he really had been getting a year younger a day. She leaves the school and, working together with the boy, who's name is Ken, they sneak into the bookstore's basement, and discover the portal there. Before returning home, Ken admits he had been relying on Yuri because she looked exactly like his mother. Later on in her room, Yuri is trying to figure out what the word \\"EMIT\\" could have meant, and laughs to herself she spells it backwards. Desperate Journey Yuri runs into an old friend she'd lost contact with, Ichirou. She's happy to see him again, but he claims that they just reunited at a party last night. Yuri doesn't remember this at all, and Ichirou said she hadn't remembered him last night either, although she did say a word he didn't understand, \\"Emit\\". Yuri is confused by this. Remembering that the boy had said his mother looked just like her, she suspects that she may have crossed into our world. In an attempt to investigate, she returns to the bookstore, but when she attempts to check the portal she is pushed into it- by herself. Awaking in the other world, Yuri finds it just as the boy describes, with old men and women running and playing in the park while children relax on the benches. She manages to meet up with Ken again, who has returned to being an old man, and he tells Yuri that his mother, whose name is Julia, has indeed fled to Yuri's world where she is viewed as being young and beautiful. Yuri attempts to return to her world, but finds that the portal patrolled by armed guards on this side. A few days later, she and Ken are waiting outside the portal in the rain. Just as Ken had, she has aged a year for every day she's spent in the other world, and is now in her early twenties. Desperate and seeing no other option, she attempts to rush past the armed guards while Ken distracts them. She succeeds in making it back to the portal, but is shot, and falls unconscious. Farewell to Me Back in Yuri's world, Julia has taken over Yuri's life and deeply enjoying herself. In exchange for Yuri aging in Julia's world, Julia is staying young. However, Ichirou has grown suspicious. Although he originally thought Yuri had simply forgotten him and gotten more mature, he's become convinced that the second Yuri he met is the real one and that someone has taken her place. He shares his suspicions with Yuri's mother, who has had similar doubts. At the same time, Yuri staggers home. The shot grazed her shoulder; she is in pain but alive. Collapsing onto the sofa, she is interrupted in her moment of relaxation by Julia wielding a knife. She stabs for Yuri's face, but Yuri dodges, and attempts to talk it out. She tells Julia that Ken is worried about her, but Julia still refuses to return. Then, Ichirou and Yuri's mother enter. Before they can arrive, Julia flees. Yuri tries to explain the situation, but Ichirou grabs her wounded arm, still thinking she is Julia. He stops when she cries out in pain. He asks her if she's the real Yuri, and is convinced when she's infuriated that he would even ask. Days later, Yuri is healthy and has returned to her normal age. Ken has returned to Yuri's world to retrieve his mother, who, now that Yuri has returned, has resumed \\"aging\\", and is now a small girl. Although they all part on good terms, Julia is reluctant to leave Ichirou.

Established in 1987, the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) partners with Ohio universities, labs and industries, providing students and researchers with high performance computing, advanced cyberinfrastructure, research and computational science education services. OSC is member-organization of the Ohio Technology Consortium, the technology and information division of the Ohio Department of Higher Education. OSC works with an array of statewide/regional/national communities, including education, academic research, industry, and state government. The Center's research programs are primarily aligned with three of several key areas of research identified by the state to be well positioned for growth and success, such as the biosciences, advanced materials and energy/environment. OSC is funded through the Ohio Department of Higher Education by the state operating and capital budgets of the Ohio General Assembly. OSC offices are located on the West Campus of The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, United States.  History  OSC was established by the Ohio Board of Regents (now the Ohio Department of Higher Education) in 1987 as a statewide resource designated to place Ohio's research universities and private industry in the forefront of computational research. Also in 1987, the OSC networking initiative ‚Äî known today as OARnet ‚Äî provided the first network access to the Center‚Äôs first Cray supercomputer. In 1988, OSC launched the Center‚Äôs Industrial Interface Program to serve businesses interested in accessing the supercomputer. Battelle Memorial Institute, located just south of Ohio State, became OSC‚Äôs first industrial user. Today, the Center continues to offer HPC services to researcher in industry, primarily through its AweSim industrial engagement program. In the summer of 1989, 20 talented high school students attended the first Governor‚Äôs Summer Institute. Today, OSC offers summer STEM education programs through Summer Institute and Young Women's summer Institute, which began in 2000. Later in the fall of 1989, OSC engineers installed a $22 million Cray Y-MP8/864 system, which was deemed the largest and fastest supercomputer in the world for a short time. The seven-ton system was able to calculate 200 times faster than many mainframes at that time.

History The organisation united various rebel Jamaat groups across the North Caucasus, including the Ingush Jamaat, Shariat Jamaat, Yarmuk Jamaat and Kataib al-Khoul, to fight the Russian rule not only in Chechnya but also in the rest of the Russian Caucasus. It was led by a Chechen commander Shamil Basayev until his death in July 2006 and since then by an ethnic Ingush Akhmed Yevloyev. Yevloyev was captured alive in June 2010. In October 2007 the Caucasian Front was subsumed into the Caucasus Emirate, a self declared Islamic State that claims the North Caucasus of Russia. While the anti-Russian local insurgencies in North Caucasus started even before the formal creation of the Caucasian Front, two months after Aslan Maskhadov's death, the new Chechen separatist leader Abdul-Halim Sadulayev officially announced that they had formed a Caucasus Front within the framework of \\"reforming the system of military-political power.\\" Along with the existing Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush \\"sectors\\", the Stavropol, Kabardin-Balkar, Krasnodar, Karachai- Circassian, Ossetian and Adyghe jamaats were included in it, meaning that in theory most the regions of the south-west Russia's would be involved in hostilities. In October 2006, Dokku Umarov established two new fronts beyond the North Caucasus region ‚Äì the Volga and the Ural fronts.North Caucasus Conflict Spreads to Tatarstan, The Jamestown Foundation, 2 August 2012 The Chechen separatist movement had taken on a new role as the official ideological, logistical and, probably, financial hub of the new insurgency in the North Caucasus. Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local rebels continue in Dagestan and Ingushetia, while sporadic fighting erupts in the other southern Russia regions. Before the declaration of the Caucasus Emirate, the movement had conducted two-large scale attacks, the 2004 Nazran raid in Ingushetia (before the formal proclamation) and the 2005 Nalchik raid in Kabardino-Balkaria. The movement also launched many smaller attacks such as the 2006 Avtury ambush & 2007 Zhani-Vedeno ambush.

Curi Calder√≥n-Lacy assumed the role of acting principal for the 2019 school year, assuming Heather Austin's role after her resignation, followed by Vaughn Steven East. There were 1,035 students enrolled in the fall for the 2017-2018 school year. It was the first public high school in Delaware to offer the International Baccalaureate program. History Mount Pleasant was one of the first schools built following the passing of the free school law of 1829. On September 22, 1830, Joseph Orr sold a lot to the School Committee of School District #2 (note: School District #1 was Naamans Creek, now the Claymont Stone School). The original Mount Pleasant schoolhouse still stands today, located on an acre of land which is now part of Bellevue State Park. When William DuPont Jr. remodeled Woolton Hall, now called the Bellevue Mansion, he also changed the exterior of the Mount Pleasant schoolhouse from stone to its present Colonial Revival style. In 1865, the school moved to a new location on Philadelphia Pike, just across the street from the Mount Pleasant Methodist Church, and then again in 1932 to a much larger facility on Duncan Road (now the home of Mount Pleasant Elementary School). In 1958, Mount Pleasant High School opened at its present location on Washington Street Extension. In 1978, the Mount Pleasant Special School District and other school districts in Delaware dissolved due to desegregation, and Mount Pleasant High School became a part of the New Castle County School District. Quinton Sterling became the first African-American principal of the high school. In 1981, the larger district split into four separate school districts (Brandywine, Christina, Colonial and Red Clay Consolidated), and Frank J. Furgele became the superintendent of the newly formed Brandywine School District. The school celebrated its 175th anniversary in a series of events during homecoming weekend, October 14 and 15, 2005, including the inaugural Mount Pleasant Hall of Fame. Academics In 2008, Mount Pleasant ranked #602 in Newsweeks top 1300 high schools, which uses a ratio of the number of AP, IB and/or Cambridge tests taken by all students at a school, divided by the number of graduating seniors. In the spring of 2008, 220 students took IB exams and more than 100 students took AP exams. Mount Pleasant's Academic Bowl team placed second in the 2008 Comcast Academic Challenge of Delaware. Athletics MPHS fields teams in football, boys' and girls' cross country, field hockey, boys' and girls' soccer, girls' volleyball, fall cheerleading, boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and girls' swimming, boys' and girls' indoor track, wrestling, winter cheerleading, baseball, softball, golf, boys' and girls' lacrosse, boys' and girls' tennis, and boys' and girls' track & field. Mount competes in the Blue Hen Conference, in Flight B. The current athletic director is Frank Kerwood. Activities Mount Pleasant is also the home of WMPH 91.7 FM, which began broadcasting on October 1, 1969, and was Delaware's only public high school radio station until McKean began broadcasting at WHMS 88.1 FM in 1998. Mount Pleasant also hosts the only completely student-run Relay for Life in the region. Over the past 5 years, over $150,000 has been raised for the American Cancer Society through this event. Mount Pleasant's chapter of the Technology Student Association has been recognized for the school's contributions to the TSA/ACS Service Project through Relay for Life. The former national president of TSA, Peter Andrews, is an alumnus of Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant puts on a spring musical every year. Past productions include The King and I (2008), Damn Yankees (2009), Footloose (2010), Les Miserables (2011), Beauty and the Beast (2012), Godspell (2013), Hairspray (2014), Rent (2015), and Vaughn: Endgame (2021). The choral department is composed of a chorale, concert choir, treble choir, show choir, gospel choir, jazz choir, as well as the Elite Eight and Sweet Adelines a cappella groups. The instrumental music department includes a symphonic band, concert band, jazz band, marching band, string orchestra, early music ensemble, and guitar quartet.

He served as the head football coach at North Texas State University‚Äînow the University of North Texas‚Äîfrom 1979 to 1980, at Texas Tech University from 1981 to 1985, and at Appalachian State University from 1989 to 2012, compiling a career college football coaching record of 242‚Äì134‚Äì2. In his 24 years at Appalachian State, Moore posted a losing season only once. He led his 2005 Mountaineers team to the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. This was the first national championship for any college football team in the state of North Carolina. Moore and the Mountaineers repeated as champions in 2006 and 2007, achieving the first \\"three-peat\\" in NCAA Division I FCS/I-AA history.

He was selected for inclusion into the Southern Conference Hall of Fame, and College Football Hall of Fame in 2014. Playing career Moore played wide receiver for the Baylor Bears. He was coached by Sam Boyd in 1958 and John Bridgers in 1959 and 1960. Moore captained the 1960 Gator Bowl team that ended the year as the nation's eleventh-ranked squad. Moore received degrees from Baylor University in finance and economics. Coaching career Moore began his coaching career at Corsicana High School under Texas high school coach Jim Acree. In 1965, he became assistant coach at SMU. After the 1972 season, he joined the Nebraska Cornhuskers as receivers coach, becoming offensive coordinator under coach Tom Osborne in 1978. In 1979, at North Texas State (now North Texas), Moore got his first head coaching job. After two seasons he left North Texas for Texas Tech, where he spent five seasons and garnered a record of 16‚Äì37‚Äì2 before being replaced by David McWilliams. After three years away from football, Moore joined the coaching staff at Arkansas where he remained for two seasons before taking the head coaching position at Appalachian State in 1989. During his tenure of twenty-four years as head coach at Appalachian State, Moore led the Mountaineers to ten Southern Conference championships and three consecutive NCAA Division 1-AA national championships (2005, 2006, and 2007). The 215 ASU victories under his leadership is a school record. 2006 NCAA Division I Football Championship Game. On September 1, 2007, Moore led Appalachian State to score one of the biggest upsets in college football history, defeating the then fifth-ranked Michigan Wolverines 34‚Äì32 at Michigan Stadium. This marked the first time a team in a lower subdivision defeated a ranked team in a higher subdivision. It was also the first game and loss for Michigan against a Division I FCS team. Moore had learned the spread offensive scheme that enabled him to defeat Michigan from then-West Virginia coach Rich Rodriguez, whom Michigan hired to succeed Lloyd Carr the following season. Moore became the 28th head coach in Division I history to reach 200 wins after the Mountaineers defeated the Furman Paladins on October 25, 2008. On December 2, 2012 after a first round home playoff loss to Illinois State, athletics director Charlie Cobb announced that Moore would not return for the 2013 season. According to a press release issued by the ASU athletic department, Cobb stated that he and Moore agreed after the end of the 2011 season that the 2012 season would be Moore's last as head coach, but chose not to make an announcement until that time. However, several days later, Moore claimed that there had been a communication gap, and that he had wanted to coach for one more season in 2013. Cobb announced that assistant head coach Scott Satterfield, who played quarterback under Moore at Appalachian from 1993 to 1995 and served as an assistant at ASU from 1998 to 2008, would serve as interim head coach while a national coaching search was conducted. Satterfield was given the permanent job on December 14, 2012.http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8747965/appalachian-state- mountaineers-choose-scott-satterfield-replace-jerry-moore Head coaching record See also * List of college football coaches with 200 wins * List of college football coaches with 150 NCAA Division I FCS wins * Texas Tech Red Raiders football under Jerry Moore References External links * Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bonham, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:American football wide receivers Category:Baylor Bears football players Category:Coaches of American football from Texas Category:High school football coaches in Texas Category:SMU Mustangs football coaches Category:Nebraska Cornhuskers football coaches Category:North Texas Mean Green football coaches Category:Texas Tech Red Raiders football coaches Category:Arkansas Razorbacks football coaches Category:Appalachian State Mountaineers football coaches Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Jerry Moore (American football, born 1939)"},{"id":"7212927","text":"Abd al-Malik ibn Rabi was among the narrators of hadith. name He was the son of Rabi ibn Sabra, and reported the hadith of Sabra reporting on the prohibition of Mut'ah on his fathers authority.

History CHAY-FM signed on the air originally with a hybrid easy listening/beautiful music format on May 21, 1977, but changed to more of an adult contemporary format the following decade with the decline of beautiful music on FM radio. The station was initially broadcast from a 1,000 foot tower just south of Barrie that it had shared with local television station CKVR-TV. On September 27 of that year, a small plane crashed into the tower, destroying the building and killing everyone on board. Toronto station CHIN-FM assisted CHAY in temporarily restoring its signal until the tower was replaced one year later. In 1989, CHAY-FM moved to more of a mainstream adult contemporary format. Throughout the transition period, the station continued to attract an audience of a quarter million listeners per week. On October 15, 2000, CHAY-FM flipped to a rhythmic contemporary/CHR format as Energy 93.1 simulcasting some programming from its sister station CING-FM in Burlington, Ontario. In 2003, the station returned to its adult contemporary format as The New CHAY 93.1 FM.

He was best known for his appearances on the U.S. independent circuit with promotions such as Eastern Championship Wrestling, Combat Zone Wrestling, Atomic Championship Wrestling, Classic Championship Wrestling, 1CW (Delaware) and Valour Pro Wrestling. Professional wrestling career Williams trained as a professional wrestler under The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson), debuting in December 1988 as Rockin' Rebel. Tri-State Wrestling Alliance In 1990, Rockin' Rebel signed with the Philadelphia-based Tri- State Wrestling Alliance. While touring with the TWA, Rebel became the first Tri- State Champion and had memorable feuds with The Sandman, D.C. Drake, and C.N. Redd. He also teamed with Jimmy Jannetty to form The Confederacy. They became top contenders to the tag team titles and feuded with teams such as The Super Destroyers and The Blackharts. Despite its success, the TWA ceased operations abruptly in 1991. Rebel returned to the promotion in early 1993 after it had been renamed Eastern Championship Wrestling. Independent circuit Rockin' Rebel hit the independent circuit after leaving ECW in 1995. He then had a brief stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and numerous dark matches with the then called World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He had successful tours of Japan, Korea and Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. in 1996. Throughout the mid-1990s, Rebel and fellow ECW alum Glen Osbourne formed a successful tag team known as Darkside. Together they won the Maryland-based Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation tag team titles five times, the Virginia-based International Pro Wrestling Association tag team titles twice, and appeared regularly for the NWA. On July 25, 2000, Rockin' Rebel debuted in Combat Zone Wrestling. He joined Lobo's Army and remained in the stable until it dissolved upon Lobo's retirement. He then formed a stable known as Rebel's Army with Derrick Frazier, Doomsday Danny Rose and former Tough Enough contestant Greg Matthews. Rebel and Matthews continued to team together in many promotions around the independent circuit such as PWF, 3PW, PWU, and World-1. Between 2003 and 2005, Rockin' Rebel made numerous appearances with Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling. He later wrestled for numerous independent federations, he wrestled his last match on May 10, 2014 for JCW in a losing effort against Q.T Marshall.

Amateur career Scanlon came to prominence when he won the junior race at the 1998 world road race championship, on his 18th birthday. After winning the world championships, Scanlon signed for the Rabobank cycling team's development squad. He failed to break through because of injuries and he left in 2000. He joined CC Etupes in France and rode lesser French races. Linda McCartney Racing Team offered him a contract in 2001 but folded before he joined them. Scanlon continued to ride in France with VC Nantes 44 and then VC La Pomme Marseille. In 2002 he won the Irish road championship. Professional career Scanlon signed for AG2R Pr√©voyance for 2003. He won a stage of that year's Tour of Denmark, leading the race for three days. He won the Irish championship again. In 2004 Scanlon became the first Irishman in the Tour de France since Stephen Roche in 1993. He also represented Ireland in the 2004 Summer Olympics in the road race on the opening day of the Games. Scanlon was injured for much of 2005 and 2006 but rode the 2006 Giro d'Italia. He left the AG2R Pr√©voyance team at the end of 2006, disillusioned with the amount of racing required in the ProTour.

Career Born in Liverpool, Nolan began his career as a trainee with Preston North End, but left in 1988 without making a first team appearance. He played non-league football with Northwich Victoria and Marine, before beginning his Football League career in 1991 with Tranmere Rovers. He helped Tranmere to the semi finals of the 1993‚Äì94 League Cup, where they faced Aston Villa. Nolan scored in the first leg to give them a 3‚Äì1 lead at the halfway point in the tie. However Villa won the second leg 3‚Äì1 and sent the game to a penalty shootout. In sudden death, Mark Bosnich saved Nolan's penalty to send the Premier League side to Wembley. Nolan moved to Sheffield Wednesday in 1994, and it was while playing for Wednesday in February 1998 that he suffered a broken leg in a challenge with Tottenham Hotspur's Justin Edinburgh; in 2001 (by which time he had joined Bradford City), he attempted to sue both Edinburgh and Hotspur in a legal case similar to that of another ex-Bradford City player, Gordon Watson.(also an ex-Sheffield Wednesday player).

There have been a number of notable changes in this important east-west route which follows the north Sussex border with Kent and Surrey. Originally the route started in Tunbridge Wells, the Pembury to Tunbridge Wells section being originally the A263. West of Tunbridge Wells, instead of following its northerly route to East Grinstead via Holtye and Hammerwood which was the B2110 prior to about 1970, it followed what is now the B2110 through Groombridge and Hartfield to Forest Row and multiplexed with the A22 to East Grinstead (which explains the present discontinuity in the B2110 at Forest Row and East Grinstead, the unexpected sharp right at Langton Green when travelling west and unexpected left at East Grinstead when travelling east along the A264). Both routes are winding and narrow and both have bridges with single file traffic. West of East Grinstead, it multiplexes with the A22 to Felbridge. The section from the west of Felbridge as far as Three Bridges has been improved and partially rerouted. For many years there was no junction with the M23 and the route went through both Crawley and Horsham. In the late 1980s, it was rerouted along the newly constructed Copthorne Link Road to Junction 10 of the M23, and in the early 1990s was multiplexed south along the M23 to Junction 11 at Pease Pottage, and along the then newly constructed SW Crawley Bypass. The section west of Crawley was upgraded to dual carriageway, and the route now follows Horsham's Northern Bypass (opened 1989; traffic previously went through the town) to its junction with the A24, then multiplexes south with the A24 (West Bypass), now also dual carriageway, to Broadbridge Heath where instead of going through the village it follows its bypass together with the A281. The old route is followed south west to Five Oaks and the A29. Thus, very little of the original A264 now carries that identifier.

During the Soviet era, forces in Armenia were part of the Transcaucasian Group of Forces. It was formerly the base of the 127th Motor Rifle Division of the Soviet Seventh Guards Army. The base is about north of the Armenian capital, Yerevan. History A Russian Army sign near the base  World War II  The base traces its history to the 261st Rifle Division of the Soviet Union's Red Army. The 261st Rifle Division began forming on 18 July 1941 at Berdiansk in the Odessa Military District. It was made up from a combination of reservists, militia, and volunteers, and its basic order of battle was as follows: * 974th Rifle Regiment * 976th Rifle Regiment * 978th Rifle Regiment * 809th Artillery Regiment The division went into Southern Front in August, first as part of 6th Army, but was reassigned to 12th Army, in the same Front, by September 1. It remained with that Army up to at least August 1942 but then was assigned to the Transcaucasian Front's Black Sea Group of Forces. It then spent much of the later part of World War II, from January 1, 1943, onwards with the small 45th Army of the Transcaucasian Front, which was guarding the Soviet borders with Turkey.  Postwar  After the war ended, the 261st Rifle Division was transferred to Leninakan. It became part of the 7th Guards Army and in 1955 was redesignated as the 37th Rifle Division. On 25 June 1957, it became the 127th Motor Rifle Division. In April 1990, the division's 120th Guards Tank Regiment was divided into the 116th Separate Guards Tank Battalion and the 1360th Motor Rifle Regiment. On 21 August 1992, it became the 102nd Military Base, the first numbered military base of the Russian Ground Forces.Michael Holm, 127th Motor Rifle Division, 2015. Present-day Map of Gyumri and its vicinity. The base is shown in pink.

By the mid-late 1990s the composition of the 127th Motor Rifle Division had changed, following the departure of the majority of the Soviet forces from Armenia. It consisted of the 123rd, 124th, and 128th Motor Rifle Regiments, the 992nd Artillery Regiment, and the 116th Independent Tank Battalion. The 123rd Motor Rifle Regiment was formed from the former 164th Motor Rifle Division, also stationed in Armenia. There are 3,000 Russian soldiers officially reported to be stationed at the 102nd Military Base located in Gyumri. In early 2005, the 102nd Military Base had 74 tanks, 17 infantry fighting vehicles, 148 armored personnel carriers, 84 artillery pieces, 18 MiG-29 fighters and several batteries of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. A great deal of military hardware has been moved to the 102nd Base from the Russian 12th Military Base in Batumi and the Russian 62nd Military Base in Akhalkalaki, Georgia which includes 35 tanks and armored vehicles and 370 pieces of military hardware. The military base is part of a joint air defense system of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which was deployed in Armenia in 1995. Furthermore, the Armenian Air Force relies partially upon the Russian MiG-29s located at the military base, for the defense of Armenia's airspace. The Russian military base was deployed on the territory of Armenia as early as 1996 (before that, the installation was still known as the 127th MRD of the Soviet Ground Forces). The bilateral treaty states that the Russian military will be in the base for 25 years, but Armenian authorities have said that if needed this time-frame can be reviewed, and exclusively in the direction of prolongation. Although Russia does not pay the Armenian government for the military base stationed in Gyumri, the Armenian side takes care of all public utilities water, electricity, etc. In 1997, Armenia and Russia signed a far-reaching friendship treaty, which calls for mutual assistance in the event of a military threat to either party and allows Russian border guards to patrol Armenia‚Äôs frontiers with Turkey and Iran. In August 2003 the base's commanding officer, General Major Alexander Titov, was dismissed for reportedly not maintaining military discipline and allowing corruption and the sale of state equipment.http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/print/?nid=36, accessed July 2009. In early 2009, the motorized arm of the base was divided two separate motor rifle brigades. In 2013, the chief commander of 102nd military base Andrey Ruzinsky said in an interview that \\"If Azerbaijan decides to restore jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh by force the [Russian] military base may join in the armed conflict in accordance with the Russian Federation‚Äôs obligations within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).\\" Supply to the base A special five-year agreement concluded with Georgia on March 31, 2006, allowed Russia access to the 102nd Military Base through Georgia's land and airspace. The agreement prohibited Russia from handing over any armament transited through Georgian territory to a third country and from transiting biological, nuclear or chemical substances, as well as weapons of mass destruction or their components.

April 13, 2011. However, most analysts and the Armenian government consider Russia the guarantor of Armenia's territorial integrity since it forms one triad of Armenia's national security framework. Incidents In 1999, two drunken soldiers, Denis Popov and Alexander Kamenev, armed with AK-74 rifles, went into the town and started a gunfight, killing two men, Vaghinak Simonyan and David Soghomonyan, and injuring 14. The two men were tried in Armenia, where Popov was sentenced to 14 years in prison and Kamenev to 15. Whether or not the two served their entire terms in Armenia is unclear and little is known about this court‚Äôs investigation and punishment. In an interview published on January 16 with News.am, Popov‚Äôs lawyer, Tamara Yailoian, claimed that her former client had been transferred to Russia ‚Äúafter two to three years,‚Äù and, ‚Äúwe later learned, set free.‚Äù Two children were killed by a mine on the training field in the vicinity of the military base in 2013. The field was not fenced or given properly warning, but nonetheless the command of the military based never punished anyone and also ignored the official complaints of the locals. In January 2015 an Armenian family of seven was massacred in their house at night by Russian deserter Valery Permyakov from the military base. He was soon apprehended, and anti-government and anti-Russian rallies ensued in Yerevan and Gyumri. A June 2015 poll in Armenia found that 55% of respondents \\"find the presence of any other state‚Äôs or structure‚Äôs military bases in Armenia acceptable\\", mostly citing the need of protection against Turkey (24%) and Azerbaijan (16%). 127th Motor Rifle Division Order of Battle, 1989-90 This listing is taken from Lenskii & Tsybin's The Soviet Ground Forces in the last years of the USSR (St Petersburg, 2001).

The governments of the United States and other countries condemned deaths and expulsions among civilians. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNHCR) passed two resolutions in 2000 and 2001 condemning human rights violations in Chechnya and requiring Russia to set up an independent national commission of inquiry to investigate the matter. However, a third resolution on these lines failed in 2004. The Council of Europe in multiple resolutions and statements between 2003 and 2007 called on Russia (a member of the Council) to cease human rights violations. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) between 2005 and 2007 conducted legal cases brought by Chechens against the Russian government, and in many of these cases held Russia responsible for deaths, disappearances and torture.

The United States statement in response to Human Rights Commission Resolution on Chechnya in 2000 noted: > As Secretary Albright noted in her March 24th speech to the Commission, \\"We > cannot ignore the fact that thousands of Chechen civilians have died and > more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes.\\" Together with other > delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports > of human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya, including > extrajudicial killings.

It reiterated its requirement, also made in 2000 resolution, for Russia to establish a national commission of inquiry to investigate crimes in Chechnya; despite Russia's failure to create such a commission or ensure effective prosecutions after the 2000 resolution, the commission declined to call for the creation of an international commission of inquiry.THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE, Human Rights Watch, 2001 In April 2004 the Commission rejected another resolution on Chechnya. 23 of 53 countries voted against the resolution, while 12 countries voted for the resolution--mainly European Union countries.

In his published comments to the Treaty, Ho≈Ç√≥wko stated apparently contrary to the \\"Prometheian\\" ideas that the Soviet control over Dnieper Ukraine is the most beneficial condition for the Polish \\"solution of the Ukrainian problem\\" as any genuinely Ukrainian government would have likely raised territorial claims towards Polish state. On the other hand, he was frequently cited as an advocate for independence of Ukraine, Belarus and other countries. His controversial stance towards the Ukrainian problem made him a target for Ukrainian extremists. Approximately 1/3 of population of the Second Polish Republic was formed of ethnic minorities,Norman Davies, God's Playground, Columbia University Press, 2005, , Google Print, p.299 but their problems were marginalized by the Polish government, whose heavy-handed policies were only serving to antagonize the Ukrainian population.Timothy Snyder, The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999, Yale University Press, Google Books, p.144Davies, God's Playground, op.cit. Eventually the extremists among Ukrainians started sabotage and assassinations campaign and Polish government responded with further repressions. Ho≈Ç√≥wko was one of the few who tried to deal with that problem with negotiations and compromise; he mediated between willing Polish and Ukrainian politicians and proposed various plans to solve the tensions, from releasing Ukrainians prisoners and granting the minorities more rights, up to giving the Kresy regions, inhabited by those minorities, substantial autonomy. However, such pro-Polish Ukrainian politicians were viewed as collaborators by the radical Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, and Ho≈Ç√≥wko's stance made him enemies among extremist politicians on both sides, who saw profit in further inter-ethnic conflict. He died in Truskawiec (Truskavets) on August 29, 1931, one of the first victims of an assassination campaign carried out by militants of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). Having experienced heart-related illness, and unable to go to abroad due to financial constraints, he had decided to stay at the health resort of Truskawiec in eastern Poland's Kresy, an area with a largely Ukrainian population. He had, moreover, chosen to stay at a guest house run by Greek-Catholic nuns of Basil of Caesarea (Sorores Basyliae), partly as a declaration of his pro-Ukrainian stance, and partly because it was less expensive. At the news that he had chosen Truskawiec to spend his vacation, the local police commissioner, unable to change Ho≈Ç√≥wko's mind, assigned a man to shadow him as a bodyguard. August 29 was Ho≈Ç√≥wko's last day in Truskawiec; unable to leave as planned because he was waiting for a cash transfer to pay for his stay, he was further delayed by a storm. Then in his room he was met by two OUN activists, Vasyl Bilas and Dmytro Danylyshyn, who shot him and left the scene.

It took place between 25 November and 20 December 1942 around the Rzhev salient in the vicinity of Moscow. The offensive was a joint operation of the Soviet Western Front and Kalinin Front co-ordinated by Georgy Zhukov. The offensive was one in a series of particularly-bloody engagements that are collectively known in Soviet and Russian histories as the Battles of Rzhev, which occurred near Rzhev, Sychevka and Vyazma between January 1942 and March 1943. The battles became known as the \\"Rzhev meat grinder\\" (\\"–†–∂–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –º—è—Å–æ—Ä—É–±–∫–∞\\") for their huge losses, particularly on the Soviet side. For many years, they were relegated to a footnote in Soviet military history.  Soviet plans  Soviet collective farmers hand over KV-1S tanks to their crews. In Operation Mars, which was planned to start in late October, forces of the Kalinin and the Western Fronts would encircle and destroy the powerful German Ninth Army in the Rzhev salient. The basic plan of the offensive was to launch multiple co-ordinated thrusts from all sides of the salient, resulting in the destruction of the Ninth Army. The offensive would also tie down German units and prevent them from being moved south. The Kalinin and Western Fronts were directed by Stalin and Zhukov \\"to crush the Rzhev-Sychovka-Olenino-Bely enemy grouping.\\" The Western Front was to \\"take Sychovka no later than the 15th December.\\" The Kalinin Front's 39th and 22nd armies were to take Olenino by 16 December and Bely by 20 December. Operation Mars was to be followed soon afterward by Operation Jupiter, which was to commence two to three weeks later. The Western Front's powerful 5th and 33rd armies, supported by 3rd Guards Tank Army, would attack along the Moscow-Vyazma highway axis, link up with the victorious Mars force, and envelop and destroy all German forces east of Smolensk. Once resistance around Vyazma was neutralized, the 9th and 10th Tank Corps and the 3rd Tank Army would then penetrate deeper into the rear of Army Group Centre.  Launch of offensive  The offensive was launched in the early hours of 25 November 1942. It got off to a bad start, as fog and snowy weather grounded the planned air support. It also greatly reduced the effect of the massive artillery barrages preceding the main attacks by making it impossible for the forward artillery observers to adjust fire and observe the results. The northern thrust made little progress. The eastern attack across the frozen Vazuza river slowly ground forward. The two western thrusts made deeper penetrations, especially around the key town of Belyi. Still, the progress was nowhere near what the Soviets expected. The German defenders fought stubbornly, clinging to their strong-points, which were often centered on many of the small villages dotting the area. In some cases, the German strong points remained manned for a time after the Soviets advanced past them, creating more problems for the Red Army in their rear areas. Despite repeated, persistent Soviet attacks, German small-arms fire and pre-planned artillery concentrations cut down the attacking Soviet infantry. Soviet tanks were picked off by anti-tank guns and the few German tanks, as well as in close combat with infantry. The relative lack of initial success compounded the Soviet problems. The minor penetrations and the resulting small bridgeheads made it difficult to bring forward reinforcements and follow-up forces, especially artillery so critical for reducing the German strong points. The Germans reacted by shifting units within the salient against the points of the Soviet advance and pinching off their spearheads. With limited reserves and reinforcement unlikely due to Soviet offensives elsewhere, the Ninth Army was placed under great pressure. Eventually the shifting of German forces, coupled with Soviet losses and supply difficulties, allowed the German forces to gain the upper hand. Their lines held, and they retook much of the lost ground. The German counterattacks against the Belyi (western) and the Vazuza (eastern) Soviet thrusts resulted in several thousand Soviet soldiers being trapped behind German lines. A few of them managed to break through to Soviet lines, some after fighting in the German rear for weeks. The trapped Soviets had to leave almost all of their vehicles and heavy weapons behind. Though the Germans were not able to remove Soviet forces from the Luchesa valley in the northwest of the salient, that was of little significance because the Soviets there were unable to press their attack through the difficult terrain.  Outcome  \\"The Western Front failed to penetrate enemy defences,\\" according to Zhukov. The Germans were able to hit the flank of the Kalinin Front and trapped Major General MD Solomatin's Mechanized Corps for three days before they were relieved. Operation Mars was a military failure, and the Soviets were unable to accomplish any of their objectives. However, in the aftermath of Operation Mars the commander of Army Group Centre, Generalfeldmarschall G√ºnther von Kluge, recommended the Germans abandon the salient to economize on manpower and to assume more defensible positions. Adolf Hitler refused. His denial of a major withdrawal in the winter of 1941‚Äì1942 had ultimately stabilized the German Army when it was on the edge of a collapse. Subsequently, he was less willing to heed the advice of his commanders. In addition, he was unwilling to give up any ground he had won and saw usefulness in retaining the salient as a starting point for a future thrust upon Moscow. However, in the spring of 1943, his desire to move back onto the offensive made him more receptive to withdrawing forces from the salient to free up manpower for operations elsewhere. A staged withdrawal was begun at the beginning of March 1943. By 23 March, the withdrawal was complete. Historian A. V. Isayev has pointed out that together with influences on other sectors during the winter of 1942‚Äì1943, Operation Mars had an effect upon the strategic situation in 1943. In the plan for the large offensive at Kursk in July 1943, the German Ninth Army was located in the southern area of the Orel salient. It delivered the assault upon the Kursk salient from the north. However, losses suffered at Rzhev during Operation Mars resulted in the Ninth Army being short of forces, particularly infantry formations, and it could not muster enough force to fulfill its task.

However, among the results of the battle were losses to the reserves of Army Group Center, which reduced the German forces that could be redirected against the more successful Soviet operations against Army Group South in the Battle of Stalingrad. About this matter, German Colonel General Kurt von Tippelskirch commented: An area of controversy is whether the operation was intended as a major offensive or was really intended to simply divert German attention and resources from Stalingrad to prevent the relief of their Sixth Army.

He termed Operation Mars as the \\"greatest defeat of Marshal Zhukov\\". The British historian Antony Beevor disagrees with Glantz by citing that Zhukov spent less time planning Mars than Uranus, and that the Soviet artillery shell allocation was much smaller for Mars than for Uranus. Operation Uranus received \\"2.5 to 4.5 ammunition loads [per gun]... compared with less than one in Operation Mars.\\" In addition, the Russian historian Makhmut Akhmetovich Gareyev, citing Stavka orders, asserted that the goal of Operation Mars was to tie down German forces in the Rzhev sector, preventing them from reinforcing Stalingrad.

The band was founded by Sucker (vocals) and his cousin Bj√∂rn (drums), along with two friends, Martin (guitar) and Filzlaus (bass). Career Originating from Germany, their first real public performance was at an annual punk rock festival in their hometown, along with other local bands. After the show, they were offered several slots as support acts for more established bands all over the world. In May 1994, they released their debut EP, Beware, Poisonous! on their own Oxyfactory Records label. The EP was soon reissued by Helen of Oi! Records in October of that year, which led to a full-length album deal. While recording Fuck The Nineties‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Our Noize, bassist Filzlaus left the band, and was eventually replaced by a friend, Arne. Helen of Oi! Records originally released the album on vinyl in May 1995, and re-released it on CD in the United States in February 1996. Following the release of Fuck The Nineties‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Our Noize, which received great underground reviews, Oxymoron began to tour across Germany as well as in Europe. The band released a split EP with English band Braindance, entitled Mohican Melodies in September 1995. Oxymoron released the Crisis Identity EP in March 1996 on Arne's short-lived Rough Beat Records label, and the band appeared on Helen Of Oi!‚Äôs Streetpunk Worldwide compilation EP in the same year. They also embarked on their first US tour, along the east coast with Braindance and The Casualties. Also in 1996, Oxymoron made the jump to the German Knock-Out Records label, which released the band's second full-length, The Pack Is Back, in April 1997. The release was followed by more touring in Europe, as well as a three-week summer tour in Japan with The Discocks. Oxymoron established themselves well in the American and German punk scene as an anti-racist streetpunk band. In 1998, several tours were cancelled, Sucker had to be hospitalized for nerve damage, and Arne decided to leave the band just weeks before they were to head back into the studio. They released a split with Dropkick Murphys titled Irish Stout vs. German Lager. Chrissy, who temporarily had been a second guitarist and had played bass on the first US tour, stepped in on bass. March 1999 saw the release of the mini-album, Westworld, and was followed by more touring of Europe as well as a seven-week coast-to-coast US tour with Dropkick Murphys and The Ducky Boys. Chrissy left the band after the tour and was quickly replaced by Morpheus. In October 2000, Oxymoron released a compilation album, Best Before 2000, which included all previous 7‚Äù singles, along with tracks from previous compilations. November 2001 marked the release of the Savage Output EP, which included three tracks from their upcoming full-length along and one unreleased track. Their third full-length album, Feed The Breed was also released in November 2001, and was followed by a six-week coast-to-coast US tour, as well as a European/German tour.

It premiered on October 31, 1994. Overview Originally called Darcy's Music, the program was hosted first by VJ Moon Zappa and then by VJ Amy Scott. The program was named after VH1's then-director of music programming, Darcy Sanders-Fulmer. The premise was that Fulmer (through an off-screen voice-over) picked her favorite videos which just happened to be alternative. Despite this, her voice was rarely heard. Most of the introductions were done by Moon, who constantly pointed out that the videos were Darcy's picks. During its second season the program was renamed Crossroads, a title the show kept for the rest of its run, and Moon Unit was dropped as the program's host. Crossroads adopted the instrumental break in the Jayhawks indie hit Blue as its theme song.

It is one of the municipalities with a large majority of German speakers in the mostly French speaking Canton of Fribourg. History Plaffeien is first mentioned in 1148 as Planfeiun. In 1339 it was mentioned as Blanfeyen.  Name  The name Plaffeien probably comes from the Latin \\"planum-fageum\\" meaning beech forest and therefore may date to the Roman era. The spelling of the name changed over time. In addition to the spellings given above, in the 13th century it was Planfeium, followed by Plainfaon or Planfeyen. Beginning around the 16th century the name became Plaffeyen. To match the standard German orthography of the German Empire, an 1899 Swiss federal decree changed the \\"y\\" in German place names into an \\"i\\", changing the official name to \\"Plaffeien\\".  Brief History  During the Roman era Plaffeien was probably a village of romanised Celts. Beginning around the end of the fifth century, the German speaking Alemanni slowly moved into the area and settled. The first written records of Plaffeien are from R√ºeggisberg Priory in 1148, which mention a village church. The church was probably built a few years previously. When the church was demolished in 1762, a stone with the year 1143 was discovered. A village school was established before 1717. In the 14th century, the nobleman Wilhelm von Englisberg donated a forest and the commons to the village, with the requirement that a mass be held in his honor every year on 25 July. This mass is still held every year. Plaffeien became a bailiwick of Fribourg in 1486 and remained so until the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798. Plaffeien's location along the road to the Euschelspass and on the banks of the Sense river meant the area was invaded several times during the wars between Bern and Fribourg. During the Reformation the village remained with the Catholic faith.  The village fire  On 31 May 1906, much of Plaffeien was destroyed in about two hours by a fire. A total of 51 houses burned down, 15 in the village of Oberschrot and 36 in Plaffeien, leaving 62 families or 274 people homeless. They began rebuilding in the summer of 1906 and the corner stone of the current church was laid on 26 April 1908. A new plan was drawn up for the village, replacing the old village with its narrow winding streets.

Composed of free women of color, the order provided nursing care and a home for orphans, later establishing schools as well. They taught enslaved children when such education was prohibited by law. The order grew in number in the late 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries, reaching a peak of 400 sisters in 1950. They taught numerous students in black parochial schools. Since the turn of the century, African Americans in Louisiana, including Creoles, had been disenfranchised by the state legislature and subject to Jim Crow laws. In the 21st century, the order operates facilities for the poor in four states and Washington, DC, in the United States, and has a mission in Belize. In 1988 the order formally opened the cause with the Holy See of the canonization of Henriette DeLille. In 2010 Pope Benedict XVI declared DeLille to be Venerable. A miracle attributed to her intercession was approved by a medical board in 2013, advancing her cause. Biography Early life Henriette DeLille was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday, March 11, 1813. Her mother, Marie-Jos√®phe \\"Pouponne\\" D√≠az, was a free woman of color of New Orleans. Her father Jean-Baptiste Lille Sarpy (var. de Lille) was born about 1758 in Fumel, Lot-et-Garonne, France.Burial act for \\"J. Bt. Lille Sarpy, aged about 77 years, who died the evening before; a native of Fumelles, Department of Lot- et-Garonne,\\" St. Fran√ßois Church Register 15, entry 1836:46, Natchitoches, Louisiana. Their union was a common-law marriage typical of the contemporary pla√ßage system.M. Boniface Adams, \\"The Gift of Religious Leadership: Henriette DeLille and the Foundation of the Holy Family Sisters,\\" in Glenn R. Conrad, ed., Cross, Crozier, and Crucible: A Volume Celebrating the Bicentennial of a Catholic Diocese in Louisiana (New Orleans: The Archdiocese in cooperation with the Center for Louisiana Studies, 1993), 360-74. She had a brother, Jean DeLille, and other siblings. Their maternal grandparents were Juan Jos√© (var. Jean-Joseph) D√≠az, a Spanish merchant, and Henriette (Dubreuil) Laveau, a Cr√©ole of color. Their paternal grandparents were Charles Sarpy and Susanne Trenty, both natives of Fumel, France.Archdiocese of New Orleans Sacramental Records (New Orleans: The Diocese, 1991), 6:247; also Alice Daly Forsyth, Louisiana Marriages: A Collection of Marriage Records from the St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans during the Spanish Regime and the Early American Period, 1784-1806 (New Orleans: Polyanthos, 1977), 37; this marriage record identifies Charles Sarpy and Susanne Trenty as natives of Fumel also. Her maternal great-grandmother is said to be C√©cile Marthe Basile Dubreuil, a woman of color considered to be a daughter of Claude Villars Dubreuil, born in 1716, who immigrated to Louisiana from France. Henriette and her family lived in the French Quarter, not far from St. Louis Cathedral. Trained by her mother in French literature, music, and dancing, Henriette was groomed to find a white, wealthy male partner in the pla√ßage system, which was a type of common- law marriage. Her mother also taught her nursing skills and how to prepare medicines from herbs. As a young mixed-race woman, under the watchful eye of her mother, Henriette attended many quadroon balls, a chief element of their social world. The balls were attended by creole free women of color, and by creole white men looking for young women as pla√ßage partners. Raised as Roman Catholic in the French tradition, DeLille was drawn instead to a strong religious belief in the teaching of the Catholic Church, and resisted the life her mother suggested. She became an outspoken opponent of pla√ßage, in which generally young, French or European-American men had extended relationships or common-law marriages with free women of color. The men often later married \\"white\\" European-American women after they were established financially. The men entered into contracts with the mothers of the young women of color, promising support and sometimes education of their mixed-race children, as well as financial settlements. In cases where a young woman was enslaved, the man might free her and their children. Some men maintained a relationship with a woman of color after marriage while others remained bachelors. DeLille believed the system was a violation of the Catholic sacrament of marriage. Henriette was influenced by Sister Marthe Fontier, who had opened a school in New Orleans for girls of color. In 1827, at the age of 14, the well-educated Henriette began teaching at the local Catholic school. Over the next several years, her devotion to caring for and educating the poor grew, causing conflict with her mother. DeLille was confirmed in 1834. During documentation of the sainthood cause for DeLille, the congregation found funeral records from the 1820s \\"that suggested that as a teenager, she may have given birth to two sons, each named Henry Bocno. Both boys died at a young age.\\" (It was customary to name the first son after the father. If the child died, the next male born would be given the father's name.) The archdiocesan archivist Charles Nolan said in 2005 that, even if DeLille \\"had given birth to two children out of wedlock, it happened two years before her confirmation in 1834.\\" Her biographer, Benedictine Father Cyprian Davis, said that her confirmation showed her increased commitment to God, as did her life in the following years. Sisters of the Holy Family Founding In 1835, DeLille's mother Marie-Jos√®phe suffered a nervous breakdown. Later that year, the court declared her incompetent, and granted DeLille control of her mother's assets. After providing for her mother's care, DeLille sold all her remaining property. In 1836 she used the sale proceeds to found a small unrecognized congregation or order of nuns, which she named as the Sisters of the Presentation. The original members consisted of DeLille, seven other young Cr√©ole women, and a young French woman. They cared for the sick, helped the poor, and instructed free and enslaved children and adults. They took into their home some elderly women who needed more than visitation, and thereby opened America's first Catholic home for the elderly. Her brother Jean DeLille was strongly opposed to her activities. He, like other members of their family, could pass for white. The DeLille children were octoroons, seven- eighths European or white in ancestry. He felt that his sister's activities within the Cr√©ole community exposed his partial African ancestry to his white associates. Estranged from Henriette, Jean DeLille moved with his wife and children away from New Orleans to a small Cr√©ole of color community in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, called La C√¥te-aux-Puces (Flea Coast). The agricultural area is now known as Grand Marais.Shane K. Bernard, Teche: A History of Louisiana's Most Famous Bayou, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2016 It is the area on the Bayou Teche between present-day Olivier, Louisiana, to below Jeanerette, Louisiana.  Recognition, Sisters of the Holy Family  In 1837, Father Etienne Rousselon of New Orleans secured formal recognition of the new congregation from the Holy See. DeLille took the title of Mother in the order. In 1842, the congregation changed its name to the Sisters of the Holy Family. Henriette DeLille continued a life of service to the poor of New Orleans. She died in 1862 at the age of 49, during the American Civil War, when the city was occupied by Union troops. Friends attributed her death to a life of service, poverty, and hard work. At the time of DeLille's death, on Sunday, November 16, 1862, the order had 12 members. The sisters were noteworthy for their care of the sick and the dying during the yellow fever epidemics that struck New Orleans in 1853 and 1897. By 1909, the order had grown to 150 members; it operated parochial schools in New Orleans that served 1,300 students. In this period, the state of Louisiana had disenfranchised most African Americans by raising barriers to voter registration, and it imposed legal segregation of public facilities, including schools. By 1950, membership in the order peaked at 400. The order today The Sisters of the Holy Family remain active today. Its more than 300 members serve the poor by operating free schools for children, nursing homes, and retirement homes in New Orleans and Shreveport, Louisiana; Washington, D.C; Galveston, Texas; Little Rock, Arkansas; and California in the United States; and a mission in Belize. Death, honors, and cause of beatification DeLille died in 1862 with a reputation of holiness. The city of New Orleans named a street as Henriette DeLille in her honor. In 1988 her order opened the cause for her canonization with the Holy See. She became \\"the first United States native born African American whose cause for canonization has been officially opened by the Catholic Church\\". Her cause was endorsed \\"unanimously\\" in 1997 by the United States Catholic bishops. Pope Benedict XVI approved her heroic virtues and named her Venerable on March 27, 2010. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints gave its formal assent on June 22, 2010, for the commencement of the cause of beatification with the declaration of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against). DeLille was given the title of Servant of God. A claimed miracle by her intercession was being investigated in 2005 and by 2017 other miracles attributed to her were under medical scrutiny.

It premiered on September 27, 1973, with a performance by The Rolling Stones and The Doobie Brothers; its last episode was in 1981. History Kirshner had been executive producer and \\"creative consultant\\" on ABC's In Concert series which debuted with two shows in November and December 1972, in the 11:30 p.m. time slot usually held by The Dick Cavett Show. The programs, taped at the Hofstra Playhouse at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., featured performances by Alice Cooper, Curtis Mayfield, Seals & Crofts, Bo Diddley, The Allman Brothers Band, Chuck Berry, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Poco, The Steve Miller Band, and Joe Walsh. Their rating more than doubled the average rating of The Dick Cavett Show and even topped NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in some markets and among viewers under the age of 35. In Concert became a bi-weekly series in January 1973. \\"Right now, we have more artists than we know what to do with,\\" Kirshner's music director Wally Gold told The Washington Post late in 1972. \\"We pay them scale to appear, which is way below what they usually get for a concert, but they know that the publicity is well worth it.

The program featured many of the popular performers of the day during its run and other notable guests included Rush, The Eagles, KISS, Foghat, The Ramones, Kansas, Van Morrison and The Allman Brothers Band. Kirshner personally commissioned rock designer Jim Evans to create a special logo for the show. The show was hosted by Kirshner up till the last season. His on-air delivery was described as flat by viewers. Paul Shaffer often lampooned him in a convincing impersonation on Saturday Night Live, which went head-to-head against \\"Rock Concert\\" in some cities between 1975 and 1981. In its final season the show was hosted by Kirshner's son and daughter. As with The Midnight Special, Don Kirshner's Rock Concert was noted for featuring live performances, which was unusual for the period since most television appearances at that time used lip-synching to prerecorded music. Kirshner's show was recorded in stereo utilizing simulcast to broadcast on FM Stereo radio stations and early Cable TV. The series also occasionally aired vintage footage of older acts such as Bill Haley & His Comets, Dusty Springfield and Ritchie Valens, which due to the age of the recordings were broadcast in mono.

History As Dorothy Goodnoh Paddock noted in the Forward of In the Beauty of Holiness‚Äîa History of Holy Trinity Church, the history of Holy Trinity is a story \\"of sturdy faith, stable tradition and spirited optimism\\". Holy Trinity's ministry started in 1886, when much of Florida was still very much pioneer country. Throughout the 1880s, many groups of settlers from the British Isles came to Central Florida to seek their fortunes. One such group of about 80 Englishmen put together by Grenville Chetwynd Stapylton, head of Stapylton & Company, settled on of land around what is now Zephyr Lake in Fruitland Park. The land had been purchased from Henderson Tanner, a freed slave, for $250. The settlers built a large boarding house on the lake called Zephyr Hall, as well as a large stable. They reportedly enjoyed a carefree bachelor lifestyle, complete with dances, parties, horse-racing and hunting. Rumor even had it that some of the younger men were becoming too carefree and in need of a sobering influence. As noted in Holy Trinity's original Vestry minute book: \\"The want of an Episcopal Church and clergyman in the English Colony ... had been for some time felt, and a movement had been made to obtain subscriptions to erect a church in the colony.\\" Their efforts to raise funds for a church were successful and Holy Trinity Church was constructed in 1888 for $2150. The construction style, known as \\"Florida\\" or \\"carpenter\\" gothic, was a modification of an English style adapted to the materials and conditions of the time and area. Sturdy and well constructed, the church remains in service to this day. In 1889, a Lych- Gate was added to provide a resting place for the bier and pall-bearers before the clergyman accompanied the funeral procession to the burial site. Similar to those found in Anglican and European churchyards, it is one of only two in Florida. During the next 116 years, Holy Trinity would experience many ups and downs, just as the State of Florida and its citizens did. But through the hard economic times, especially those brought on by the citrus freezes, Holy Trinity's doors remained open. In August 1952, the Church Vestry and Guild voted to take whatever steps \\"were necessary for this mission to become a parish\\" That goal was realized nearly 13 years later when Holy Trinity Church was received into full parish status during the May 1965 Diocesan Convention. In recognition of its architectural and historical significance and to help encourage its preservation, the Church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 30, 1975. Holy Trinity took a major step in January 2005 in reshaping its future when it established All Saints Chapel, a second worship site along the rapidly growing Highway 27 corridor between Leesburg and Clermont. The new chapel has been growing steadily since its first service, Easter Sunday 2005.

Knopf from a screenplay by Christopher Isherwood based on a story by John Erskine. The music score was composed by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, and Robert H. Planck was the cinematographer, who filmed in CinemaScope and Eastmancolor. The exceptionally lavish costumes were designed by Walter Plunkett. The film stars Lana Turner, Pedro Armend√°riz, Roger Moore, and Marisa Pavan, and features Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Torin Thatcher, Taina Elg, John Lupton, Henry Daniell, Melville Cooper and an early film appearance by Stuart Whitman. It was Turner's last film under her longtime MGM contract and thus marked another stage in the decline of the studio star system. Plot The action is set in 16th-century France. Diane de Poitiers (Lana Turner) becomes the mistress of Prince Henri (Roger Moore), second in line to the throne. Their liaison continues through Henri's arranged marriage to the Italian Catherine de' Medici (Marisa Pavan). Unknown to Catherine, her Medici relations arrange the death of the Dauphin and Henri's ascent to the throne as King Henry II. The antagonism of the two women, abetted by Medici scheming, eventually results in the death of Henri. Catherine, now ruling as regent for her three young sons, banishes Diane but spares her rival's life in a gesture of mutual respect.

Film rights were bought in 1939 by producer Edwin H Knopf, story editor for Sam Goldwyn. Knopf tried to get financing for the film but was unable. In 1953 the project was reactivated. Knopf re-secured the film rights from Erskine's estate and took the project to Dore Schary, head of production at MGM, where Knopft had a deal. Schary agreed to finance. Greer Garson was originally mentioned as a possible lead. Schary also announced he hoped to get Greta Garbo to come out of retirement to play the role. It eventually went to Lana Turner. Turner said Diane was an interesting woman \\"one who used her charm intelligently. Actually she was a forerunner of today's modern woman; she was Europe's first outdoor girl, a health fan and an advocate of the cold bath. She wasn't afraid to use her head, but was never caught with her brains showing.\\" Reception Christopher Isherwood deplored the treatment of his screenplay, attributing the problems to interventions by the leading lady. Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa created an arrangement of his music called \\"Beauty and Grace,\\" and his score has been issued on compact discs by Film Score Monthly. Box office The film was an expensive failure at the box office ‚Äì according to MGM records it made only $461,000 in the US and Canada and $771,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $2,660,000. DVD Diane was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on May 28, 2013 via the Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service.

The Florida Times-Union, p B-4. Green Cove Springs was a popular winter resort at the time, and a woman from Boston who spent her winters there wrote to Bishop John Freeman Young asking that a chapel be built to serve the town's seasonal guests. Winter visitors and year-round residents together raised more than $1,000 to build the church on a donated lot valued at $500. The first service was held on March 10, 1879. The building stands on 3-foot-high piers about 40 feet from the St. Johns River.Stepzinski, Teresa. Pg B-1. Windows The church's stained-glass windows came from Colgate Studio in New York City, one of the earliest stained-glass studios in the United States. The windows were created by Henry E. Sharp and are among the earliest examples of American-designed and manufactured stained glass in Florida. The windows cost $1,100 when the church was built. In the windows behind the altar, three beatific women represent the virtues of St. Mary: faith, charity and hope. The angel Gabriel is in the center of the rose window above the altar. Restoration In 2012 parishioners in the 150-member congregation made memorial donations to restore the 18 stained-glass Lancet windows on the east and west sides of the church. The church received a $22,500 state historic preservation grant in 2013 to complete restoration of the windows. The state grant was matched by an anonymous donor. The restoration will include cleaning the windows, re-stenciling and re-leading them if necessary, and repairing the framework supporting the windows. The stained glass also will be covered in clear Lexan thermoplastic that is resistant to ultraviolet light and is ventilated to reduce moisture and sun damage.

It is located in the Caucasus region in south west Russia. It is the political successor of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. From a centralized form of government during the existence of the Soviet Union, the republic's political system went upheavals during the 90s with the unrecognized establishment of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria which led to the wars, the First Chechen War and the Second Chechen War which left the republic in total devastation. In 2000, following Russia's renewal rule, a local, republican form of government established in the republic under the control of the Russian federal government Political background In November 1990, the first Chechen National Congress was convened. It was an opposition movement headed by Major-General Dzhokhar Dudayev. In March 1991, the Supreme Soviet refused to take part in the All-Russian referendum on the introduction of the position of the President of the Russian Federation. That was the beginning of Chechnya's refusal to be involved with any All-Russia voting, which lasted for many years. Zavgaev who had supported the 1991 Coup (GKChP) was overthrown on September 6 by the Dudaev-led National Congress, and on October 27 presidential and parliamentary elections were held in Chechnya, and Dudaev became President.Emil A. Payin and Arkady A. Popov: U.S. and Russian Policymaking With Respect to the Use of Force, Chapter 2: Chechnya The Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt on 19 August 1991 became the spark for the so-called Chechen revolution. On 21 August the NCChP called for the overthrow of the Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush Republic. On September 11, 1991 Gennady Burbulis and Mikhail Poltoranin were dispatched from Moscow by the federal authorities to try restore order. On September 14, Ruslan Khasbulatov, a Chechen elected in 1990 to the Supreme Soviet of Russia from Grozny and its acting chairman after June 1991, arrived in Grozny. On September 15, at a special session of the Chechen-Ingush Supreme Soviet, he persuaded the deputies to remove Zavgaev and to disband, in anticipation of new parliamentary elections, which were set for November 17. The political struggle between the radical nationalist forces, grouped around Dudaev and pushing for independence, and the conservative nomenklatura, trying to preserve the status quo, continued. In September 1991, NCChP squads seized the local KGB headquarters, and took over the building of the Supreme Soviet. The NCChP declared itself the only legitimate authority in the region. In October 1991, Dudayev was elected president of the Chechen-Ingush Republic, with 85% of the vote. Dudayev, in his new position as president, issued a unilateral declaration of independence on 2 November 1991. Increasing instability in the Chechen Republic in 1992-1993 was related primarily to the competition between several major teips (clans) which started to struggle for control over oil, drugs-trafficking and arms smuggling. In 1993, several presidential decrees and government orders were issued in Moscow for tightening control on the Chechnya borders but with little practical effect, since Dagestan was not particularly interested in implementing those while the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia was not even demarcated after the split. Government of Akhmad Kadyrov Russian President Vladimir Putin established direct rule of Chechnya in May 2000. The following month, Putin appointed Akhmad Kadyrov interim head of the government. Government of Ramzan Kadyrov Since December 2005, the pro-Moscow militia leader Ramzan Kadyrov is functioning as Chechnya's prime minister and the republic's de facto ruler. Kadyrov, whose irregular forces are accused of carrying out many of the abductions and atrocities; has become Chechnya's most powerful leader since the 2004 assassination of his father Akhmat. The 29-year-old was elevated to full-time premier in March 2006, in charge of an administration that is a collection of his allies and teip (clan) members. In the same month, the Ramzan Kadyrov government officially took control of Chechnya's oil industry and rejected a federal proposition of the republican budget, demanding much more money to be sent from Moscow; for years, Chechnya was known as a Russia's \\"financial black hole\\" where the funds are widely embezzled and tend to vanish without trace. On March 30, 2006, Interfax reported Chechen People's Assembly Chairman Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov has spoken in favour of a complete withdrawal of all Russian federal forces except the border guards. In April 2006 Kadyrov himself criticized remaining units of federal police, namely Operational/Search Bureau (ORB-2), and called for their immediate withdrawal from the republic. He also called for refugee camps scattered about Chechnya to be closed down, saying they were populated by \\"international spies\\" intent on destabilizing the region. Later this month, Abdurakhmanov said Chechnya should be merged with Ingushetia and Dagestan; Ingush and Dagestani leaders disagreed. Paradoxically, a merger would reflect the will of Chechen separatists of establishing an Islamic state across the North Caucasus. On April 29, 2006, after a deadly clash between Kadyrov's and Alkhanov's men in Grozny, Ramzan Kadyrov officially disbanded his security service. Kadyrovites, an irregular army of thousands of former rebels, have been pivotal in supporting Kadyrov. Rights activists working in Chechnya say the Kadyrovites abused their powers to crush any rivals to Kadyrov; they have repeatedly accused Kadyrov's personal guard of using kidnapping, murder and torture to cement his rule. On May 2, 2006, representatives of European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the Council of Europe's anti-torture watchdog, said they were prevented from entering the fortress of Ramzan Kadyrov, the alleged site of prisoner abuse; rights activists claim that prisoners and kidnap victims are tortured in secret jails in Chechen villages, including Tsentoroi, the ancestral home of the Kadyrov clan. Kadyrov's deputy is Idris Gaibov. Constitution A constitution was adopted in March 1992. The constitution was semi-presidential. It is unclear how long the constitution was even nominally operational. In April 1992 President Dudayev began to rule by decree and in June 1993 parliament was dissolved. Following the First Chechen War and the Second Chechen War, the constitution was not in force due to the political and social catastrophic situation in the Republic. On March 23, 2003, a new Chechen constitution was passed in a referendum. The 2003 Constitution granted the Chechen Republic a significant degree of autonomy, but still tied it firmly to the Russian Federation and Moscow's rule. The new constitution went into force on April 2, 2003. The referendum was strongly supported by the Russian government but met a harsh critical response from Chechen separatists. Many citizens chose to boycott the ballot. The international opinion was mixed, as enthusiasm for the prospect of peace and stability in the region was tempered by concerns about the conduct of the referendum and fears of a violent backlash. Chief among the concerns are the 40,000 Russian soldiers that were included in the eligible voters' list (out of approximately 540,000). Following the constitution's approval, President Putin said \\"The results have surpassed even our most optimistic expectations, This shows that the people of Chechnya have made their choice in favor of peace, in favor of positive development together with Russia\\".Chechnya approves new constitution No independent international organization (neither the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) nor the United Nations) officially observed the voting, but observers from Organisation of the Islamic Conference, League of Arab States, CIS, Muslim countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Yemen, Oman et al.) have recognized a referendum \\"free and democratic.\\" The OSCE, the United States State Department, and the United Kingdom's Foreign Office all questioned the wisdom of holding the referendum while the region was still unsettled. Elections 2003 presidential elections On October 5, 2003, presidential elections were held in Chechnya under the auspices of the March constitution. As with the constitutional referendum, the OSCE and other international organizations did not send observers to monitor proceedings. The Kremlin-supported candidate Akhmat Kadyrov earned a commanding majority, taking about 80 percent of the vote. Critics of the 2003 election argue that separatist Chechens were barred from running, and that Kadyrov used his private militia to actively discourage political opponents. 2004 presidential elections On August 29, 2004 a new Presidential election took place. At night on August 21, 2004, a week before the appointed elections of the President of the Chechen Republic, large-scale military operation was carried out by Chechen fighters in the capital city of Grozny, targeting polling stations and other government targets. According to the Chechen electoral commission, the Kremlin-backed Militsiya General Alu Alkhanov was reported to have won the elections with almost 74%, with over 85% of the people having voted according to Chechen elections commissions head Abdul-Kerim Arsakhanov. Many observers, such as the U.S. Department of State, International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, as well as the opposition, question the election, citing, in part, the disqualification of the major rival Malik Saidullayev on a technicality. Polling conditions were also questioned, but no formal complaints have been made. The election was internationally monitored by the Commonwealth of Independent States and Arab League; western monitors didn't participate in monitoring the election in protest at previous irregularities, despite being invited. 2005 parliamentary elections The latest Chechen elections were held in November 2005. The independent observers said that there were plenty of Russian troops and more journalists than voters at polling stations. Lord Judd, a former Council of Europe special reporter on Chechnya, regarded the elections as flawed; \\"I simply do not believe we will have stability, peace and a viable future for the Chechen people until we have a real political process,\\" he said. The candidates all belonged to Moscow-based parties and were loyal to Chechnya's Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov. Islamization In 2006 Kadyrov has also started to create laws he says are more suitable to Chechnya's Islamic heritage‚Äîbanning alcohol and gambling on January 20, and enforcing women's use of headscarves‚Äîin defiance of Russia's secular constitution. He also publicly spoke in favor of polygamy on January 13, and declared that lessons in the Koran and Sharia should be obligatory at Chechen schools. On February 11, Ramzan criticized the republican media for broadcasting immoral programs and officially introduced censorship in Chechnya. Because of the cartoon scandal that shook the whole Muslim world, Kadyrov issued a brief ban on the Danish Refugee Council, the most active humanitarian organization in Caucasus. On June 1, 2006, Moscow-backed Chechen President Alu Alkhanov said he would prefer his republic be governed by Sharia law and suggested adapting the Islamic code, speaking in Paris after inconclusive talks with the Council of Europe. \\"If Chechnya were run by Sharia law, it would not look as it does today.\\" Alkhanov also dismissed reports of conflicts with Kadyrov, who was widely believed to want to take over the presidency when he turned 30 in October that year and now can legally assume the job. Rule of the Beno clan In several days after Ramzan Kadyrov was promoted to the post of President of Chechnya on March 2, 2007, serious changes have taken place in the leadership of the republic, affecting not only the top-ranking officials but also the middle-ranking ones. Kadyrov dismissed Grozny's mayor, Movsar Temirbayev, who was appointed to the post by his father in late 2003, and his place was taken by Muslim Khuchiyev. Former deputy prime minister Odes Baysultanov (a cousin of Ramzan Kadyrov on his mother's side of the family) received the vacated post of prime minister. The deputy interior minister, Sultan Satuyev, was replaced by Alambek Yasayev. Khalid Vaykhanov was given the post of secretary to the Chechen Council for Economic and Social Security, replacing German Vok, who tendered his resignation shortly before Alu Alkhanov resigned as Chechen President. In the view of local observers, Ramzan Kadyrov is actively building his own \\"vertical of power\\" in the republic, placing his men in all the leading and more or less important positions.

The old chapel is among the 5 oldest wooden churches still standing and in use in Florida. There is some irony with this chapel/church. Margaret Fleming financed the building of this church. She died shortly before its completion in 1878 and the first service in it was her funeral, just before the construction was completed. Her Father-in-Law, George Fleming (1760‚Äì1821) immigrated from Ireland and settled in the late 18th century on what is now referred to as Fleming Island, just south of Orange Park and Jacksonville, FL. (And across the St. Johns River from the Bartram Trail). He and his wife (Sophia Fatio) tended orange groves and other crops on their plantation. George Fleming named his island plantation Hibernia, the Latin word for Ireland, in honor of his island home country. The island property was gained by a land grant from the Spanish. The land had previously been cleared and planted, but had been abandoned. The property was on the west bank of the St. Johns River and was therefore in what was called ‚ÄúIndian Florida‚Äù. Land to the east of the river was called ‚ÄúSpanish Florida‚Äù. George Fleming's grave is the oldest grave recorded in the church cemetery. The elder Fleming left the plantation to his son Lewis. Lewis married Augustina Cortes, descendant of Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes. Augustina died during childbirth in 1832 leaving Lewis alone to raise their three children. Lewis married Margaret Seton in 1837. She was a devout Episcopalian. They built a plantation home in 1845 that became known as the \\"Great House\\" (previous homes had been burned by local Indians). After Lewis' death in 1862, Margaret was the overseer of the plantation. During the civil war, Union Officer Guy Henry forced Margaret and the children to vacate the \\"Great House\\". After the war, Margaret returned to the Great House and continued to oversee the plantation. To supplement revenues for the suffering plantation, Margaret opened her home as a bed and breakfast to the tourists that traveled the St. Johns River. Margaret would educate and teach scripture to her slaves and plantation workers in the sitting room of the Great House. As her congregation grew, Margaret needed more space, thus began construction of the chapel in 1875. Margaret died in 1878 just before the chapel was complete. The first ceremony held in the yet unfinished chapel was Margaret's funeral service. In 1880, the church was moved to its current location, only a few feet from where Lewis and Margaret are buried. Current use In 2005, St. Margaret's Parish dedicated a new 450-seat church building near the old building. Due to changes in church leadership and a steadily declining membership, St. Margaret's Church closed its doors in the Spring of 2012. The chapel can now be toured and the main church is being leased by First Assembly of God Fleming Island. To tour the old chapel call 904-282-3030.

He also wrote a series of 19 humorous books and for 40 years wrote a weekly humour column which began in 1976 in a local Thunder Bay newspaper called Lakehead Living and at its peak was syndicated to more than 50 newspapers in Canada and internationally. Life and career Black's father, also named Arthur, ran a stockyard in Toronto with his three brothers until his death in 1960. A year after his father's death, the younger Black moved to the rural community of Fergus, Ontario, where he had relatives, in order to finish high school and then returned to Toronto to study journalism at the Ryerson Institute of Technology. He travelled in Europe for four years, earning some money on freelancing jobs such as writing for a tourist guide. Returning to Canada, he worked variously as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman, oil tanker deckhand, cow wrangler at the Ontario Public Stock Yards, sheet metal apprentice, and plumber's assistant. His broadcasting career started with CBC Radio in Toronto when he was hired in 1972 to contribute livestock reports to Radio Noon. In 1974, he moved to CBC Radio station CBQ in Thunder Bay to host that station's version of Radio Noon. He was also a contributor to the regional weekend program Fresh Air for several years until Basic Black began as a national variety program, initially originating from Thunder Bay before relocating to Toronto a few years into its run, and finally to Vancouver in 1995 until it concluded its run. For television, he wrote and hosted Weird Homes and Weird Wheels for a total of five years on the Life Network in the late 1990s. Black is the author of 19 books and a three-time winner of the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour as well as winning a National Magazine Award for Humour, and an ACTRA Award for Best Opinion/Commentary, a Cadogan Award for Best Weekly Newspaper Column, and the Ohio State Award for Best Children's Series. Black moved to Salt Spring Island, British Columbia in 1995. After ending Basic Black in 2002, he could still be heard for about a decade, twice a week, on CBC Victoria's local All Points West program with a segment called \\"Planet Salt Spring\\". In retirement, Black volunteered as a driver for Meals on Wheels, raised money for local causes and developed a hobby carving walking sticks. In 2017, he became involved in local politics campaigning for a \\"no\\" vote in a referendum on incorporating Salt Spring Island as a municipality saying \\"We've got something special here. Don't try to change Salt Spring. Let Salt Spring try to change you.\\" His position prevailed. Black was diagnosed with Stage IV terminal pancreatic cancer on 2 January 2018 and blogged in the last weeks of his life about what he called his \\"final journey\\". In excruciating pain when the cancer became much more aggressive, Black chose to die with medical assistance at Lady Minto Hospital on Salt Spring Island on 21 February 2018.

The series premiered on American and Canadian television on September 25, 2006. The first season, which finished 21st of 142 American primetime television programs in Nielsen ratings, was released on DVD and HD DVD on August 28, 2007. The second season ranked 21st of 220 in the ratings, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 26, 2008, with the Blu-ray release of the first season. The third season aired in two blocks generally without reruns; it premiered on September 22, 2008, on NBC in the United States and on Global in Canada, with a one-hour clip-show and two regular episodes. The fourth season aired from September 21, 2009, to February 8, 2010. Although cast members had stated and speculated that there would be a fifth season, NBC announced on May 14, 2010, that the show was officially cancelled, but that the network was looking at plans to tie up some loose ends in either a miniseries or TV movie.\\"Official: NBC cancels 'Heroes'\\" from The Hollywood Reporter (May 14, 2010) Within the seasons of Heroes are \\"volumes\\", which focus on shorter story arcs. The first season comprises a single volume of 23 episodes called Genesis, which is also the title of the pilot episode. The second season was designed to contain three volumes called Generations, Exodus, and Villains, but Exodus was scrapped due to viewer criticism and the 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike. Villains was carried over to the show's third season, leaving the second season with only 11 episodes, 13 fewer than were originally ordered by NBC. The third season included 25 episodes, 13 episodes comprising Villains and 12 episodes in a volume titled Fugitives. The fourth season consisted of a fifth volume of 18 episodes titled Redemption. The final scene of the last episode began a sixth volume entitled Brave New World, which became the title of the first episode of Heroes Reborn. Originally, the second season of Heroes was to be followed in April and May 2008 by six stand-alone episodes of a new series, Heroes: Origins, which was intended as an alternative to a long mid-season hiatus like the one that led to a drop in ratings for Heroes in its first season. The project, which was later planned to be 12 episodes, was indefinitely postponed due to a decline in viewership and the strike and was eventually cancelled to keep \\"the Heroes mothership as strong as possible,\\" according to NBC co-chairman Ben Silverman. A series of three webisodes collectively titled Going Postal became available exclusively online in July 2008. Following the release of Going Postal, four more sets of webisodes were produced, titled Heroes: Destiny, The Recruit, Hard Knox, and Nowhere Man, which stars David H. Lawrence as Eric Doyle. On September 28, 2009, a new set of webisodes titled Slow Burn was released, starring members of the \\"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\\" from season four, Lydia, Edgar and Samuel. Slow Burn was set up as a Web Exclusive for the promotion of Sprint Now, and each webisode was released at the same time as the episodes of the main television series.

Its federal identification number, or CFDA number, is 10.558. Section 17 of the National School Lunch Act, and USDA issues the program regulations under 7 CFR part 226., Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP): Why CACFP Is Important Program benefits The program‚Äôs benefits consist of nutritious meals and snacks served to eligible children and adults who are enrolled for care at participating child care centers, adult day care centers, outside-school-hours care centers, after- school at-risk programs, family and group day care homes, and homeless and emergency shelters. These centers and shelters can be public and private non- profit centers, proprietary organizations, schools, private homes, and elderly centers, among others, on condition that they all comply with federal, state and local licensing and approval requirements. Through CACFP, children and older adults gain access to \\"nutritious foods that contribute to the wellness, healthy growth, and development of young children, and the health and wellness of older adults and chronically impaired disabled persons.\\" Administration The USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers the program through grants-in-aid to states. The program is administered within most states by its designated educational agency, such as New York‚Äôs Department of Health. In certain states, the program is administered by an alternate agency, such as the state department of health, family and/or social services. At the discretion of the state‚Äôs governor, different agencies may administer the program‚Äôs child-care and adult day-care components, such as Wildwood C.A.C.F.P in Colorado. In the state of Virginia, the program is directly administered by the Food and Nutrition Service Mid-Atlantic Regional Office (MARO). Actual federal assistance provided to states and their designated agencies are in the form of cash reimbursement for meals served, and any other donation by the USDA to provide such meals. Program funds are provided to states through letters of credit issued under the FNS Agency Financial Management System. The states, in turn, use the funds to reimburse institutions for costs of actual operations (e.g., providing meals), as well as to support state administrative expenses. Generally, a state‚Äôs claim to cash reimbursement from the USDA is computed by first determining the number of meals served (by category and type), and multiplying the amount of service by a per-unit payment rate, also known as the ‚Äúreimbursement rate.‚Äù The ‚Äútype‚Äù of meal refers to the kind of meal service for which the institution seeks reimbursement, such as breakfasts, lunches, snacks, supplements, and dinners served. The ‚Äúcategory‚Äù refers to the type of economic need of the child or adult to whom a meal is served, which can be categorized as ‚Äúpaid,‚Äù ‚Äúreduced price,‚Äù or ‚Äúfree‚Äù meals. Child-care, adult day-care, and outside-school-hours centers may charge a single fee to cover tuition, meals, and all other day care services to recoup certain costs; however, the vast majority of these centers operate non-pricing (free) programs. Nevertheless, all institutions must determine the eligibility of children and adults enrolled at these centers (e.g. ,low-income, mentally or physically disabled, etc.) for free or reduced price meals because such eligibility determinations affect the reimbursement rates for meals served to the participants. Homeless children residing at a participating homeless shelter are considered categorically eligible for meals served by that shelter. After-school at-risk programs, emergency shelters, and family day care homes are prohibited from charging separately for meals.

They were founded in 1837 as the Sisters of the Presentation by Henriette DeLille, adopting the current name in 1842. Background Inspired by the work of Sr. St. Marthe Fontier, a member of the French religious order of the Dames Hospitali√®res, who impressed her with her words of faith and acts of charity, around 1829, Henriette DeLille joined Juliette Gaudin, a Haitian, and Josephine Charles and began efforts to evangelize New Orleans slaves and free people of color. In 1836, Henriette and her friends formed the Congregation of the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, New Orleans' first confraternity of women of color.Stuart, Bonnye E.

The Religious of the Sacred Heart provided Henriette, Juliette and Josephine spiritual formation and experience in formal religious community living. They took private vows on November 21, 1852. Father Etienne Rousselou, the congregation's advisor, named Henriette DeLille Mother Superior. She took the name Sister Mary Theresa; however, everyone called her Mother Henriette. The Sisters of the Holy Family began as a diocesan congregation. They were assisted by Marie Jeanne Aliquot, who as a white French woman was prevented by law from joining a congregation of women of color. The Association of the Holy Family, a lay group of freepersons of color contributed financially, and helped found the Hospice of the Holy Family, for the elderly sick and poor. The sisters provided a home for orphans and taught slaves at a time under Louisiana law when educating slaves was illegal. In 1921, the sisters assumed responsibility for a school for children of color in St. Francis Parish, previously run by the Sisters of the Most Holy Sacrament.Stockman, Dan. \\"Religious communities face changes, plan to retain missions and preserve history\\", Global Sisters Report, June 2, 2016 Today The Sisters of the Holy Family is a congregation of pontifical right.

Walden led the Cowboys to consecutive Skyline Conference titles and was the league's player of the year as a senior in 1959. He was drafted by both the Cleveland of the NFL and Denver Broncos in the first AFL Draft in 1960. Walden was offered more money by the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League and elected to sign in the CFL. He played several seasons in Canada as a backup quarterback before starting his coaching career at the high school level in Amory, Mississippi. Coaching career Walden began his college coaching career at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln on Devaney's staff, where he assisted on consecutive national championship teams in 1970 and 1971. After the 1972 season, Devaney retired and Walden then coached for four seasons at the University of Miami under Pete Elliott and fellow Devaney assistant, Carl Selmer. Washington State Walden followed Warren Powers, another Devaney assistant, to Washington State University in Pullman as offensive backfield coach in 1977 and when Powers left for the University of Missouri after the season, Walden succeeded him as head coach of the Cougars. He was the head coach at WSU from 1978 through 1986, compiling a record in nine seasons and coached some of the greatest players in school history, including Jack Thompson, Rueben Mayes, Kerry Porter, Ricky Reynolds, Paul Sorensen, Pat Beach, Brian Forde, Lee Blakeney, Mark Rypien, Dan Lynch, Keith Millard, and Erik Howard.

He was the great-grandson of Chaim Volozhin.Russian Jewish Encyclopedia Early years Yosef Dov Soloveitchik was born to Rivka, a granddaughter of Chaim Volozhin. His father was Yitschok Ze'ev, descendant of Simcha Rappaport. In his youth, Soloveitchik lived in Brod. One anecdote illustrates his early mastery of rabbinic learning. Shlomo Kluger, the rabbi of Brod, enjoyed engaging in Talmud studies with him. When Soloveitchik was about to leave Brod, Kluger is reputed to have said to him, ‚ÄúYou have always resolved my kushyos (difficult Talmudic questions). But I have one difficulty you cannot resolve. How will I manage to part from you?‚Äù Rosh yeshiva Soloveitchik was reputed to have one of the great minds of his time. In 1854, he was considered a candidate for rosh yeshiva of Volozhin yeshiva, over Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin. During this time he would lead the Yeshiva alongside the Netziv. However, Berlin would ultimately be selected for the position, resulting in Soloveitchik relocating to Brisk. Rabbinate In 1865, Soloveitchik became rabbi of Slutsk. After assuming this position, he went to visit the cheder classes where the young boys received their education. When he observed the impoverished state of many children, he arranged for lunches to be served there, paid for by the community. His son, Chaim Soloveitchik, once said that while he himself responded to peoples‚Äô needs, his father went further and discovered on his own what their needs were. His pupils in Slutsk included Joseph Rosen, later to gain fame as \\"the Rogatchover Gaon\\", and Zalman Sender Shapiro. He was a fierce opponent of the Maskilim, as a result of which he left Slutsk in 1874. He then moved to Warsaw where he lived in poverty. When the rabbi of Brisk, Yehoshua Leib Diskin left for the Land of Israel in 1877, Soloveitchik was offered the rabbinate of Brisk. He continued to hold that position until his death in 1892, when he was succeeded by his son Chaim Soloveitchik. He is buried at the Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw. Works Soloveitchik composed works on Jewish law (responsa) called Shu\\"t Beis Halevi, as well as a commentary on the first book and part of the second book of the Bible (Beis Halevi al Hatorah).

Since then, there have been dozens of suicide attacks within and outside the republic of Chechnya, resulting in thousands of casualties among Russian security personnel and civilians. The profiles of the suicide bombers have varied, as have the circumstances surrounding the bombings. Although the most publicized Chechen suicide attacks have taken place in Moscow, most attacks have occurred in Chechnya, while several additional attacks have taken place in the extended North Caucasus region and particular the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. The majority of suicide bombings, targeting military installations and government compounds in and around Chechnya and also top government officials, have been directed against those whom the separatists consider to be combatants. Summary As of 2009, most of the bombers appear to be ethnic Chechens, with a few known exceptions. Although some of the attacks may have also been carried out by Ingush, an ethnic group closely related to the Chechens (the Ingush bear a separate set of grudges against Russia, including Russian support of the Ossetian side of the East Prigorodny Conflict), none have occurred in the republics of Dagestan and Kabardino- Balkaria or with any known involvement of local rebel groups there. There is no evidence of any foreign involvement in either the planning or execution of Chechen attacks aside from the inspiration from the tactics employed in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. In contrast to Palestinian suicide bombers, whose families are offered large cash rewards, no financial rewards are given. Female suicide bombers, referred to as \\"shahidka\\" by Chechens (meaning a female Islamic martyr) or \\"Black Widows\\" by Russians (as they have often had their husbands [and/or children] killed by the Russian army or the Kadyrovtsy), comprise a clear majority of Chechen suicide attackers; this trend stands in direct contrast to ongoing suicide bomb campaigns in Israel and Iraq, where women constitute only a small minority of suicide bombers.Women bombers break new ground, BBC News, 15 November 2005 What is also somewhat unusual about Chechen bombing is that although the tactics used are largely similar to those used by Islamic militants, religion is usually not the cited motivation, despite Russian claims. For example, female bomber Khava Barayeva stated that she attacked in the name of Chechen independence, and urged more Chechens to do the same for their national honor. Family members of identified bombers often suffer severe reprisals (beatings, arson attacks, kidnappings, torture and murder) at the hands of masked gunmen presumed to be government agents and members of pro-Kremlin militias, although the same may be said about the relatives of all Chechen rebels. Through the first five years of the Chechen-Russian conflict (including the First Chechen War and most of the first year of the Second Chechen War), there were no planned suicide bombings related to Chechnya. The highest concentrations of suicide attacks to date occurred in the following time periods: * the summer of 2000, when suicide bombers used cars and trucks filled with explosives] to attack military and police targets in Chechnya * 2003‚Äì2004, when a much- publicized wave of explosive belt terrorist attacks against Russian civilians swept out of Chechnya and into Moscow * the summer of 2009. The 2009 terrorists appear to have been mostly male, targeting police and regional top officials in and near Chechnya. Radical rebel commander Shamil Basayev and his extremist gang, Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs, claimed responsibility for many of them. In late 2004, following the Beslan disaster, attacks (excluding those against the Kadyrov regime) ceased for four years due to major changes in tactics employed by the separatist movement. The reason for this was cited as a certain amount of shame over Beslan on the part of the Chechen separatists. A spokesman said in 2004 that \\"A bigger blow could not have been dealt on us. ... People around the world will think that Chechens are beasts and monsters if they could attack children.\\" The bombings resumed by 2008 and in April 2009. Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov announced the reactivation of the Riyadus-Salikhin extremist gang, which had been disbanded in 2006 at the behest of Umarov's predecessor Sheikh Abdul Halim. Numerous attacks were then conducted during what Umarov called the \\"year of offensive\\". The Emirate's leadership has been compelled to revert to the tactic of istishhad by the influx of volunteers, which has coincided with a severe shortage of food and weapons.The tactic of istishhad, Prague Watchdog, October 5th 2009  Russian suicide bombing incidents  :This list is incomplete.

Bush administration managed the Iraq War after the 2003 invasion. It follows Woodward's previous books on the Bush administration, Bush at War and Plan of Attack. Based on interviews with a number of people in the Bush administration (although not with George W. Bush himself), the book makes a number of allegations about the administration. Newsweek magazine presented a special excerpt of the book.

After Bush signed a directive (along with Rumsfeld and acting CIA director John McLaughlin) ordering that \\"NOFORN would no longer apply to the British and Australians when they were planning for combat operations, training with the Americans or engaged in counterterrorism activities\\",pg 319 of State of Denial officials within the Pentagon instead began creating a parallel SIPRNet to which classified information would be slowly copied over after review. * Although members of the Bush administration publicly said the situation in Iraq was improving, internal reports and memos distributed between various government agencies, including the White House and The Pentagon, acknowledged the situation was worsening. * Senate Minority Leader (later Majority Leader) Harry Reid (D-Nevada) said of Bush, \\"I just can't stand him\\".

It more like a raw intelligence product, full of unverified and often contradictory assertions. Nor is it \\"written\\" as you or I might write, that is, by composing one page after another to form a coherent narrative or argument. Rather it is compiled in rough chronological order of incident, without much regard to sequencing of thought.

The book \\"is replete with [typical] Woodwardian reporting: secret meetings recounted in vivid detail, complete with lengthy, verbatim quotations of what key players said to each other as the story unfolded. Once again, it all reads as if Bob Woodward was lurking in the background as the meetings happened, taking exceptionally detailed notes. But of course he was not there. We learn not only what the president and all his men said but also what unspoken thoughts raced through their minds. But Mr. Woodward wasn't inside their heads either, it is safe to say.\\" Concluding that \\"Mr. Woodward attempts to write like a novelist, not a journalist,\\" Karl adds that \\"As more than a few people have noted over the course of Mr. Woodward's long career, his narratives are propelled in part by who talks to him and, just as important, who gives him the best, most detailed and colorful descriptions of what went on in all those secret meetings.\\" Karl, Jonathan, \\"So This Is Journalism?\\", The Wall Street Journal, October 11, 2006 *\\"This is a fun book, a weighty book, and a political tour-de-force.

It was published in the United States in August 1976 by Delacorte Press. In 1978 Richard Attenborough directed a feature film adaptation of the story that starred Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret.  Plot summary The novel concerns a man named Corky Withers, a shy, odd-tempered and alcoholic magician, whose lackluster performances start to turn around when he adds a foul-mouthed ventriloquist's dummy, Fats, to the show. It chronicles Corky's childhood and adolescence, and his deep love for a high-school crush named Peggy Ann Snow. The novel is written kaleidoscopically, changing time period, location, and point of view swiftly and leaving important information, such as the identity of Fats the dummy, unknown for extended periods of time.

It was developed in Brittany, a province in northwest France, from native ancestral stock dating back thousands of years. The Breton was created through the crossbreeding of many different European and Oriental breeds. In 1909, a stud book was created, and in 1951 it was officially closed. The breed is often chestnut in color, and is strong and muscular. There are three distinct subtypes of the Breton, each coming from a different area of Brittany. The Corlay Breton is the smallest type, and is generally used for light draft and under saddle work. The Postier Breton is used for harness and light farm work. The Heavy Draft Breton is the largest subtype, and is generally used for the hardest draft work. This horse breed has been used in military, draft and agricultural capacities. It also has been used to improve and create many other draft breeds, and to produce mules. Characteristics  Breton horses are usually about tall, but may range from , depending on type. They usually have a chestnut coat, often with a flaxen mane and tail, but can also be bay, grey, or red or blue roan. Bretons have a well-proportioned head of medium volume with a straight profile and a strong, short neck well-set into muscular withers. The shoulder is long and sloping, the chest broad and muscular, the back short and wide, and the croup sloping. The legs are well-feathered, short but powerful, with broad joints and well- formed hooves. Subcategories There are several subtypes of the Breton breed. Two, the Trait Breton and the Postier Breton, are officially recognised,Le Trait Breton Syndicat des √©leveurs du cheval Breton; Les Haras Nationaux (in French) Accessed August 2011 while others such as the Corlais or Cheval de Corlay and the Centre-montagne or Central Mountain Breton are not. Older types that have disappeared include the Grand Breton and the Bidet Breton or Bidet d'Allure. Postier Bretons at pasture The Corlay Breton is derived from crossbreeding native stock with the Arabian and Thoroughbred, and is considered the real descendant of the original Breton. It has the same general features as the draft type but is smaller with a more dished face. It was used mainly for light draft work that required speed and under saddle, and its numbers have been decreasing in recent years. The type is also known as the Cheval de Corlay, and is now extremely rare. It was also used in local races because of its speed, which it inherited from its Arabian and Thoroughbred ancestors. Postier Bretons were developed as a result of crossbreeding with the Norfolk Trotter and the Hackney during the 19th century. This type is bred mainly in central Brittany, has a very attractive gait, is a good coach horse, and capable of light farming work. Its name originates from its use in pulling mail coaches. The Postier was used extensively by the French Horse Artillery, and it has been described as a lighter version of the Suffolk Punch draft breed from Great Britain. The Heavy Draft Breton is derived from an infusion of Ardennes and Percheron blood. It is very strong relative to its size and has short but muscular legs. It is bred in the northern coastal area of Brittany, in Merl√©ac. This type has absorbed another, older type, called the Grand Breton, a heavier horse that was used to improve many other draft breeds. The Centre-montagne or Central Mountain Breton is a smaller draft type.  Breed history  Bretons were originally bred for great strength and durability. Horses have been present in the Breton mountains for thousands of years, but nobody knows how they first arrived.\\"Breton\\" The International Museum of the Horse. Referenced August 1, 2011. One theory is that they were brought to Europe during the Aryan migration from Asia over 4,000 years ago, while another school of thought has them descending from horses bred by Celtic warriors before their conquest of Great Britain.\\"Breton\\". Oklahoma State University. Referenced January 6, 2008. Postier Bretons at rest in pasture The original ancestors of the Breton were a population of horses that lived in the Breton mountains, possibly descended from steppe horses ridden by Celts. During the Crusades, these mountain horses were crossed with oriental horses to create a type known as the Bidet Breton. In the Middle Ages, the ancestral Breton horse was sought by military leaders, partly because of its comfortable gait, which was said to be partway between a brisk trot and an amble. Due to its gaits and the fact that it only stood about high, it was nicknamed the Bidet d'Allure or Bidet Breton. Horses of other bloodlines brought back to Europe during the Crusades had a strong influence on the Breton, and two types subsequently developed.Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies. Bongianni, Maurizio. Simon & Schuster, Inc., 1988, p. 90. . The Sommier was the common, heavier type, used mainly as a pack horse and for farm and draft work. From the Sommier, the Roussin was developed, was used mainly in wars and on long journeys. The Roussin's natural ambling gait made it popular as a lighter riding horse. The breed retained its mountain roots with its main stud, the National Provincial Stud, being located in the mountain country of Langonnet. It was at this time that Arabian and Thoroughbred blood was added to the breed, creating the Corlay subtype. From the Middle Ages until the early 1900s, the Breton was crossed with various horses, both native and foreign, including the Boulonnais, Percheron and Ardennes breeds. In the 19th century it was crossbred with the Norfolk Trotter, which resulted in a lighter weight type of Breton, the Postier subtype. Today, the Breton breed is controlled by the Syndicat des √âleveurs de Cheval Breton, an organization dating its studbook to 1909 when it was created, with separate books for the Heavy Draft and Postier types. In 1912, the books were combined but separate sections were used for each type, and in 1926 the sections were combined so that all types of Bretons are now registered together. Postier Bretons must be of documented Posteir bloodstock and pass in-harness performance tests. In 1920, the decision was made to permit no new outside blood into the studbook, and in 1951 the studbook was officially closed to outside horses. Breton horses are only eligible to be registered if they were foaled in the present-day region of Brittany or in the Loire-Atlantique department, formerly part of Brittany. Registered foals are branded with a \\"cross surmounting a splayed, upturned V\\" on the left side of the neck. Despite the registration restrictions, breeding of the Breton horse has spread across France, and around the world. Today in France, the Breton is bred mainly at studs in Lamballe, Hennebont, and parts of La Roche-sur-Yon. Crossbreeding In harness For a time, there was a trend to increase the size of draft horse breeds to gain more power and bulk through crossbreeding. However, due to its endurance and gaits, the Breton was an exception. Crossbreeding was shown to reduce the breed's unique qualities, and so in the 1930s, infusions of other blood were abandoned, and this decision led to the preservation of the breed's purity. Therefore, rather than being subject to crossbreeding itself, the Breton has instead been used to improve many other breeds. Buyers come to France from all over the world to buy Bretons for use in improving their native draft horses. The Breton had a significant influence on the Canadian Horse, after members of the breed were sent to New France (Canada) during the 17th century. They have also been used to create the Swiss Freiberger, as well as other heavy draft breeds. Bretons were used in India to produce mules, and at the Saharanpur breeding farm were crossed with the Anglo-Arabian stallion Myst√®re to produce carriage horses. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Italian farmers attempted to use the Brabant to improve local stock, but the offspring proved to be too heavy and slow for the lighter, more general draft work required. In the 1930s, the Hispano-Bret√≥n breed was developed in Spain by crossing imported Breton stallions with local mares. Today, the breed population is small, but has been noted by researchers for its rich genetic diversity. After World War II, a Breton stallion was used to improve the Schleswig breed of Germany. Uses The Breton is used in many capacities, due to the various sub-types of the breed. Smaller types can be used under saddle and for fast, light draft work, while larger types are ideal for heavy draft and agricultural work. They are also commonly used to improve other breeds through crossbreeding. Today, the breed is used as a draft horse on small farms, and is also used to gather seaweed. It is also bred for meat production; horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland.

Life The Stonebreaker. The Val d'Aosta, 1858 Brett was born near Reigate on 8 December 1831, the son of an army vet. His sister Rosa Brett was also an artist and during 1850 and 1851 they shared a studio.Payne, Christiana, John Brett: Pre-Raphaelite Landscape Painter (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2010), pp. 7‚Äì8. In 1851 he began lessons in art with James Duffield Harding, a landscape painter. He also studied with Richard Redgrave. In 1853 he entered the Royal Academy schools, but was more interested in the ideas of John Ruskin and William Holman Hunt, whom he met through his friend the poet Coventry Patmore. Inspired by Hunt's ideal of scientific landscape painting, Brett visited Switzerland, where he worked on topographical landscapes and came under the further influence of John William Inchbold. In 1858 Brett exhibited The Stonebreaker, the painting that made his reputation. This depicted a youth smashing stones to create a road-surface, sitting in a brightly lit and brilliantly detailed landscape. (The treatment provided a strong contrast with Henry Wallis's painting of the same name, exhibited the same year.) The precision of the geological and botanical detail in Brett's version greatly impressed Ruskin, who praised the painting highly, predicting that Brett would be able to paint a masterpiece if he were to visit the Val d'Aosta in Italy. Partly funded by Ruskin, Brett made the trip to paint the location, exhibiting it in 1859, again to high praise from Ruskin, who bought the painting. Other critics were less effusive, one describing it as a \\"gravestone for post-Ruskinism\\".The Critic, XVIII, 1859, p.544, quoted in Tate Gallery, The Pre-Raphaelites, 1984, p. 175 Brett continued to paint carefully detailed landscape views, staying in Italy on many occasions in the 1860s. He was always keen to stress the scientific precision of his rendering of nature, but often infused it with moral and religious significance, as recommended by Ruskin. In his later years he painted more coastal subjects and seascapes, subjects he came to know well due to his ownership of a 210-ton schooner, Viking (which had a crew of twelve), on which he travelled the Mediterranean. During summers in the 1880s Brett rented the castle at Newport, Pembrokeshire to use as a base for his large family while he painted, sketched and photographed the south and west coasts of Wales. An exhibition in 2001 at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff, entitled John Brett - a Pre-Raphaelite on the Shores of Wales brought together many of the major works from this period of his career. Brett was also a keen astronomer, having studied the subject from childhood. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1871. Brett was a founder member of the Art Workers' Guild and Master in 1890.

After graduating from high school, Sahashi went to Paris to attend university and majored in physics although it took him five years to complete a two-year course. The award status of his degree is unknown. Nova Founding Sahashi was born and raised in Kishiwada, Osaka}. He spent several years jobless after returning from France before founding Nova in 1981 with two foreign English teachers. He is the inventor of Nova's particular teaching method, \\"The NOVA System Concept\\", which he patented. The Concept is perhaps most comparable to the direct method of language instruction, although Sahashi's method pivots on the interaction with and the repeating of an instructor who was a native speaker. Sahashi thought a native speaker's voice would alleviate the difficulty of the average Japanese brain to distinguish English from background noise, as Japanese and English languages evoked different brain wave patterns. Sahashi had also patented a video phone camera device, a telephone interpretation (translation) system and an at-home medical examination system which provides a virtual consultation room, a virtual waiting room, a virtual nursing room and a virtual individual conversation room depending upon the desired operation although the system does not provide for actual treatment. Financial crisis and downfall Sahashi was the company's long standing President and CEO until 2007. Following governmental restrictions and a financial crisis in 2007, Sahashi was removed as president by an emergency board meeting for failing to adequately explain his \\"opaque way of fundraising and negotiating with potential business alliance partners.\\". According to the Daily Yomiuri, Sahashi made 159 million yen in 2006, even though his company lost 2.9 billion yen. The Mainichi Shimbun reported that Sahashi and his family's stock in the company rapidly declined over a two-week period in September 2007, from holdings of 70% to 20%. It is believed this was done without filing a legally required report. A possible criminal complaint will be filed with legal authorities by receivers for Nova if it is proven Sahashi sold the stock without first filing the required report with authorities. In 1997, Sahashi paid 900 million yen in taxes, the fifth-highest paying taxpayer in the country. Criminal investigations and arrest Sahashi came under scrutiny almost immediately after the collapse of Nova when court appointed administrators of the company allowed the media inside the president's luxury suite at Nova's administrative headquarters in Osaka to show \\"an example of (Sahashi) using the company to benefit himself.\\" The office, a 330-square- meter executive suite on the 20th floor, housed a red-carpeted reception room, private quarters including a dining room with a large-screen TV, a bathroom with sauna, a Japanese-style tea room and a room with a double bed. Sahashi immediately submitted a petition to a local court rebutting allegations that he had used company assets to benefit his own wealth and lifestyle. In February 2008, police announced they were investigating Sahashi for aggravated breach of trust for using his position to reap profits for his affiliated company, Ginganet, which he also controlled. Ginganet sold the TV-phone sets system to Nova in addition to leasing the Ginganet-managed server for the video-phone lessons. The investigation revealed that Ginganet had illicitly received around 500 million yen in profits from Nova for the use of the server. The bankruptcy administrator had also earlier noted that the price of the TV-telephone devices Ginganet charged Nova was unreasonably high, which could have resulted in Nova losing several billion yen. In June 2008 police also announced they were investigating Sahashi for possible embezzlement in the course of business for his ordering the transfer of the entire balance of a separately managed employee fund to a Nova business account to allow the payment of refunds to students. Sahashi, who owned the affiliate firm that handled the money transfer, did so in July 2007 to cover operating costs without the approval of employees. Nova employees had made monthly contributions from their pay to fund a mutual aid organization that covered the costs of business trips and occasions of congratulations or condolence. Rarely used, it had an accumulated balance of 300 million yen at the time of the transfer. On the same day that investigators raided Nova Kikaku's former headquarters, Sahashi along with former president and accounting manager of Nova Kikaku, Toshihiko Murata, were arrested on June 24, 2008 and questioned about misappropriation of funds. While Sahashi acknowledged that the fund was under his control he denied any wrongdoing and on July 30, 2008 he announced his intention to plead \\"not guilty.\\" Murata, reputed to be Sahashi's right- hand man, reportedly admitted to allegations of embezzlement in the conduct of business. On August 26, 2009 Sahashi was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to three and a half years of imprisonment with hard labor. (Japanese) In December 2010 his sentenced was reduced to two years by the Osaka High Court.Mainichi Daily News, December 2, 2010 He appealed against this conviction, but the appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on December 19, 2012.The Japan Times Ex-Nova language school founder Sahashi's two-year prison term finalized Retrieved on November 26, 2012 Name change News articles occasionally differ in the spelling/pronunciation of his last name.

The village is located on the left bank of the Schuylkill River, opposite Phoenixville and Chester County. Mont Clare is at the site of the former Jacobs' ford. Mont Clare hosts the only functional lock and one of only two remaining watered stretches of the Schuylkill Canal. Mont Clare was the birthplace of the infamous outlaw Sundance Kid. The village was originally named Quincyville. The village name has also been spelled Quinzyville, Mont Clair and Montclare.  History   Time line  Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, there was an aboriginal American encampment or village on the site, of the Unami speaking Lenni-Lenape tribe. All but a few individuals had vacated the area by 1773.Ibid., p. 10.  Colonial and Revolutionary War periods  The site's original English colonization was as part of the Duke of York's holdings. In 1681, King Charles II granted the land to William Penn, creating the Province of Pennsylvania. The site became part of Penn's Manor of Gilberts, as well as part of Philadelphia County. In 1729, Providence Township was created out of much of the Manor, including the site. The earliest recorded resident of European descent on the site appears to have been Patrick Gordon, who settled in Providence Township, along the Schuylkill in what is now Mont Clare. This Gordon was Deputy Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania from 1726, until his death in 1736. In 1761, another Patrick Gordon, relation to Deputy Governor Gordon unknown, leased a \\"plantation\\" from the sons of William Penn. This Gordon lived in an improved cave in the hill below where the Mont Clare railroad station would be located over 100 years later. Newspaper accounts show him to be living in the vicinity as early as 1757. He was reportedly unmarried and owned female slaves which lived in the cave with him. Those newspaper notices show he also came into possession of his neighbor's livestock on occasion. In Colonial America the ford drew traffic through Quincyville. Bean's History of Montgomery County Pennsylvania suggests Quincyville was the location of Joseph Richardson's 1766 licensed inn.Bean, p. 348 The ford was used by American and British troops during the American Revolutionary War. In the fall of 1777, Lord Cornwallis' troops forced a passage of the ford. This move ultimately led to the British taking Philadelphia. Gordon's Cave became the site of a very minor American victory when a British squad tarried there to liberate a roasting goose and were captured by militia.Pennypacker, Annals of Phoenixville, p. 107 In 1784, Philadelphia County was split and the village became part of the newly formed Montgomery County. On 3 December 1785, of land at what is now Mont Clare, were sold by John Penn and John Penn, Jr., grandsons of William Penn, to Quaker John Jacobs for ¬£2,600. The first Jacobs to live on the property was colonial Assemblyman and future Representative at the 2nd United States Congress, Israel Jacobs.Ibid., p. 282 In 1805, Providence Township was split along the Perkiomen Creek, leaving the village in the newly formed Upper Providence Township.  Canal era  In the 1820s, the construction of the Oakes Reach canal, of the \\"Schuylkill Navigation\\", through the village brought more commerce and traffic. The Oakes Reach started in Mont Clare, ran down past neighboring Port Providence, and reentered the river at Oaks. Black Rock Dam, Lock 60 and a house for its lock tender were built in Mont Clare. In the mid-20th century, the lower mile was filled in when the river was dredged, however the upper portion was kept watered at the insistence of Mont Clare and Port Providence residents who use it for recreation. In the winter of 1843-1844, Joseph Whitaker, ironmaster and state legislator from Phoenixville, obtained a charter for the first Mont Clare Bridge. Starting in the summer of 1844, the bridge was constructed to replace the ford.Ibid., p. 175 In 1846, Whitaker sold his interest in the Phoenix Iron Works and moved across the river to Quincyville to land he had purchased there. Whitaker built a dwelling and a steam saw mill. Whitaker's residence was named Mont Clare (or Montclair, see below) at the 1847 suggestion of poet Bayard Taylor,Pennypacker, Annals of Phoenixville, p. 144. setting the stage for the future name of the village. By 1859, Quincyville consisted of \\"an inn, store, steam saw mill, lumberyard, and seventeen houses. There was formerly an iron foundry and machine shop here, which ha[d] been converted to a paper mill\\". \\"There was also a post office here, which was discontinued in the spring of 1858.\\" The post office reopened from 1861 to 1868, but with the name Mont Clare. Through the 1870s, the village name transitioned from Quincyville to Mont Clare (see below).  Rail era  Between 1882 and 1884, the Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad was completed between Philadelphia and Reading with a station in Mont Clare. The line comes up from Philadelphia on the river bluff then turns out above the northern part of Mont Clare on a high viaduct that then crosses the Schuylkill River into Phoenixville. The line crosses what was the front yard of the Mont Clare estate house. Fortunately the house has an equal rear entryway, so they moved the driveway to the former back door. In 1900, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) combined the line with five other subsidiaries to form the Schuylkill and Juniata Railroad. In 1902, the PRR eliminated the subsidiaries and took direct ownership of the line. In late 1906, an express train derailed in Mont Clare, narrowly avoiding plunging into the river and any loss of life. PRR discontinued the Mont Clare station between 1955 and 1958. After the PRR successor, Penn Central's, failure and the takeover of its successor, Conrail, the line now belongs to Norfolk Southern, who used it for freight. After two years of no local use, the line was formally taken out of service at the end of 2007. As of 2009 one rail has been observed to be disconnected just south of the Bridge Street(PA 29) overpass in Mont Clare. The line is part of the alignment in the moribund Schuylkill Valley Metro light rail proposal, and the more recent, and less ambitious, Green Line rail proposal. Both proposals would reestablish rail service from Mont Clare to Philadelphia, via Norristown and Paoli, respectively. In 1886, the Mont Clare Post Office was reopened, although it took the name Montclare from 1895 to 1905. The Post Office remained open until the decline of small post offices at the end of the 20th century. Eventually Mont Clare was assigned the ZIP Code 19453. At the end, the Post Office was located at the eastern corner of Bridge and Walnut Streets in a small storefront in an apartment building. The Mont Clare Post Office finally closed again near the turn of the 21st century. Village mail is delivered by the Phoenixville Post Office to the still active 19453 ZIP Code, as well as to the Phoenixville Post Office's own 19460 ZIP code area, which entirely surrounds 19453. Mont Clare firehouse on Bridge Street In 1900, the volunteer Mont Clare Fire Company was formed. Chartered in 1910, Company 55 celebrated their 100th anniversary in 2010. Besides traditional fire and rescue, they have water rescue units with boats and divers, reflecting the river and canal location of Mont Clare. In 2012, under economic pressure from the township, the Company merged with the volunteer Oaks Fire Company to form the Black Rock Volunteer Fire Company, Montgomery County Station 99. The Black Rock Company continues operations from the Mont Clare and Oaks fire houses.  Village names  1906 Topographic Map of Mont Clare, the larger Phoenixville is to the west The village gradually changed its name from Quincyville to Mont Clare in the latter half of the 19th century, adopting the name of the estate of one of its most prominent residents. An early recognition was the naming of the reopened village Post Office as \\"Mont Clare\\" in 1861. In 1871 and 1872 atlases, the village is still labeled Quincyville, but Samuel W. Pennypacker refers to only Mont Clare in his 1872 Annals of Phoenixville and Its Vicinity.Pennypacker, Annals of Phoenixville, pp. various. An 1873 map shows it as Mont Clare. In an 1877 atlas, it is shown as \\"Mt. Clare\\", but that atlas' included history of Upper Providence refers to it as \\"Quincyville or Mont Clare\\"Ibid., p. 27. and \\"Quincyville, perhaps better known as Mont Clare\\".Ibid., p. 28. There is a story that the railroad dubbing the local station Montclair after Whitaker's estate was the source of the name change. However the railroad and its Mont Clare station were constructed in the 1880s, well after the name appeared beyond the estate. Some references show both names simultaneously. The county map in Bean's 1884 history shows Mont Clare on the river and Quincyville as an adjacent village, inland.Bean, p. 1. Harley's 1881 history refers to both names individually in a list of Upper Providence villages.While the 1891 Revised Edition of Harley was used, it does not list the Penna. RR line in Upper Providence, so it is referred to here by the original 1881 publication date. So while there is some possibility there were once two villages, the 1871 and 1877 atlases are the most detailed and both have insets detailing the property ownership of the same village on the river, but with the name changed. The 1895 atlas has no mention of Quincyville. The spellings of the village's names are the subject of some historical debate. There are several 1850s references to Quinzyville, including legislation and Post Office lists. [Note: A version of Bean's History on the web names it Quineyville, but this is a transcription error.] An 1895 Philadelphia Inquirer article claims that Bayard Taylor spelled the estate's name Mont Clair 48 years previously and notes the railroad company's using the spelling Mont Clare might be due to a \\"blind guess\\" that would be \\"near enough to pass\\". Yet Pennypacker, who grew up in his grandfather's Mont Clare estate, consistently spells the name Mont Clare in his Annals of Phoenixville and attributes the estate's name to Bayard with that spelling. But Phoebe H. Gilkyson, a Whitaker great-granddaughter and later resident of the estate, refers to the house as Montclair in her papers.Correspondence with Neal Gilkyson Thorpe, Phoebe's daughter, 28 September 2010. In any event, Mont Clare is the modern spelling listed by both the USPS and GNIS, although the latter lists Montclare as a variant, as used on the map below. In 2012, GNIS added Quincyville, Quinzyville, and Mont Clair as additional variant names for Mont Clare, based on this article and its references.  Historical maps  * 1849 Map of Montgomery County - Showing bridge, but not many residences in the village * 1871 Map of Quincyville and Upper Providence Township * 1877 Map of \\"Mt. Clare\\" and Upper Providence Township * 1884 Map of Montgomery County EnlargedOriginal  Geography  Mont Clare is located inside a bend of the Schuylkill River, which forms the western and southern sides of the village. The village is at a historical ford and present day bridge. Originally settled between the river and a bluff, the village has expanded northeastward up the bluff along Bridge Street (PA29). The lower part of Mont Clare is in the river flood plain. In 1995, Montgomery County designated the Mont Clare Cliffs and Ravines as a natural area \\"priority site\\". Extending upriver from Mont Clare along the Schuylkill, this series of \\"steep cliffs and deeply etched ravines\\" are formed by the intersection of hard Lockatong Formation argillites with the river.Ibid., p. 212. Arts and culture  Mont Clare is primarily a residential community. The village has two churches: the Holy Archangel Michael Byzantine Catholic Church (locally known as St. Michael's) and the Otterbein United Methodist Church. Commercial concerns include Produce Junction, Eagle's Nest Deli & Market, a professional office building, and two local automobile repair shops. A ten-minute walk across the bridge accesses downtown Phoenixville's restaurants, pubs, and theater. Mont Clare is the site of Lock 60, a fully restored and operating lock at the upstream end of the Oakes Reach of the Schuylkill Canal. The lock, tow path, the restored lock tender's house, and surrounding area form a park maintained by the Schuylkill Canal Association (SCA). The park is at the center of the \\"Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section\\" Historic District. The park includes a floating dock in the canal and a launch area on the river. This complements a portage trail, between the downstream end of the canal reach and the river. The river, portage, canal, and park form a canoe and kayak loop. St. Michael's has a large recreation area on the left bank of the canal, below the lock tender's house. SCA's annual summer Canal Day festival usually spans both parks. St. Michael's park also hosts the annual Ancient Order of Hibernians local Irish Festival. There is another park, Port Providence Park, on the canal between Mont Clare and Port Providence. Until 2020, Mont Clare was the western end of the contiguous Schuylkill River Trail (SRT) out of Philadelphia. The SRT now crosses the Mont Clare Bridge to continue westward through Phoenixville. Montgomery County plans to improve and extend the parallel Schuylkill East Trail on the left bank of the river, westward from Mont Clare, creating a major trail junction at Mont Clare. Joseph Whitaker's Mont Clare estate home still stands on the corner of Bridge and Grace Streets (Grace was Joseph's wife). The home is currently occupied by three generations of Whitaker descendants.  Notable people  By 1760, David Todd had settled near Mont Clare. His sons, John; Robert; and Levi, were notable pioneers and helped found Lexington, Kentucky. Many of David's descendants were still living in the township in 1884. The most well known Todd descendants were Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of U. S. President Abraham Lincoln, and their son, Robert Todd Lincoln, Secretary of War under President Chester A. Arthur.Bean, p. 1048. In 1855, future Mennonite Church leader and publisher, John F. Funk, had his first job teaching in a one-room school house in Quincyville. The eventual 23rd Governor of Pennsylvania, Samuel W. Pennypacker, spent his boyhood at the Mont Clare estate of his maternal grandfather, Joseph Whitaker. In 1862, Pennypacker had his first professional job teaching in a one-room school house in the village. Mont Clare is the 1867 birthplace of the infamous outlaw Harry Alonzo \\"The Sundance Kid\\" Longabaugh. The movie, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, erroneously states Sundance was born in New Jersey (possibly due to confusion with Montclair, New Jersey). Sundance was born at 122 Jacobs Street. Sundance's mother's family, Place, was from Mont Clare, with one relative, Daniel Webster Place, marrying Mary E. Pennypacker in 1873. Harry A. Place was the alias the Sundance Kid used when he married the woman known to history as Etta Place. Sundance's parents, Josiah and Annie (Place) Longabaugh, and his sisters Samanna and Emma, are buried in the nearby Morris Cemetery in Phoenixville. Between 1882 and 1899, poet and local historian Christian Carmack Sanderson grew up living in Mont Clare and adjacent Port Providence. The home at 205 Jacobs Street is referred to as \\"The Little Brick House\\" in his writings. In 1916, the Mont Clare estate was occupied by Phoebe Hunter Gilkyson, a great granddaughter of Joseph Whitaker. Mrs. Gilkyson was a noted literary and social figure, whose poems and stories were published in Harper's, Scribner's and McClure's Magazines. She also wrote a newspaper column. Her husband Hamilton H. Gilkyson, Jr. was a local business and civic leader. Phoebe's son, Terry Gilkyson was a songwriter and musician. Terry co- authored the chart topping Memories Are Made of This and wrote the Oscar nominated \\"The Bare Necessities\\" from the 1967 movie The Jungle Book.

The vector Laplacian is similar to the scalar Laplacian. Whereas the scalar Laplacian applies to a scalar field and returns a scalar quantity, the vector Laplacian applies to a vector field, returning a vector quantity. When computed in orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the returned vector field is equal to the vector field of the scalar Laplacian applied to each vector component. Definition The vector Laplacian of a vector field \\\\mathbf{A} is defined as : abla^2 \\\\mathbf{A} = abla( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A}) - abla \\\\times ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A}). In Cartesian coordinates, this reduces to the much simpler form: : abla^2 \\\\mathbf{A} = ( abla^2 A_x, abla^2 A_y, abla^2 A_z), where A_x, A_y, and A_z are the components of \\\\mathbf{A}. This can be seen to be a special case of Lagrange's formula; see Vector triple product. For expressions of the vector Laplacian in other coordinate systems see Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Generalization The Laplacian of any tensor field \\\\mathbf{T} (\\"tensor\\" includes scalar and vector) is defined as the divergence of the gradient of the tensor: : abla ^2\\\\mathbf{T} = ( abla \\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{T}. For the special case where \\\\mathbf{T} is a scalar (a tensor of degree zero), the Laplacian takes on the familiar form. If \\\\mathbf{T} is a vector (a tensor of first degree), the gradient is a covariant derivative which results in a tensor of second degree, and the divergence of this is again a vector. The formula for the vector Laplacian above may be used to avoid tensor math and may be shown to be equivalent to the divergence of the Jacobian matrix shown below for the gradient of a vector: : abla \\\\mathbf{T}= ( abla T_x, abla T_y, abla T_z)=\\\\begin{bmatrix} T_{xx} & T_{xy} & T_{xz} \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{yx} & T_{yy} & T_{yz} \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{zx} & T_{zy} & T_{zz} \\\\end{bmatrix} , \\\\text{ where } T_{uv} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\partial T_u}{\\\\partial v}. And, in the same manner, a dot product, which evaluates to a vector, of a vector by the gradient of another vector (a tensor of 2nd degree) can be seen as a product of matrices: : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A_x & A_y & A_z \\\\end{bmatrix} abla \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot abla B_x & \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot abla B_y & \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot abla B_z \\\\end{bmatrix}. This identity is a coordinate dependent result, and is not general. Use in physics An example of the usage of the vector Laplacian is the Navier-Stokes equations for a Newtonian incompressible flow: :\\\\rho \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial t}+ ( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right)=\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{f}- abla p +\\\\mu\\\\left( abla ^2 \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right), where the term with the vector Laplacian of the velocity field \\\\mu\\\\left( abla ^2 \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) represents the viscous stresses in the fluid. Another example is the wave equation for the electric field that can be derived from the Maxwell's equations in the absence of charges and currents: : abla^2 \\\\mathbf{E} - \\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathbf{E}}{\\\\partial t^2} = 0. The previous equation can also be written as: :\\\\Box\\\\, \\\\mathbf{E} = 0, where :\\\\Box\\\\equiv\\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2}- abla^2, is the D'Alembertian, used in the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation.

English local history came to the fore with the antiquarians of the 19th century and was particularly emphasised by the creation of the Victoria County History series in England. Its establishment as a formal academic discipline is usually credited to W. G. Hoskins who also popularised the subject with his book The Making of the English Landscape. History There is incidental material in the writings of Bede which can be used for local history although he wrote a national rather than local history. During the late medieval, travel writers such as John Leland frequently visited and described local antiquities, although once again, these writers did not set out to write local history. The Tudor period saw the publication of national gazetteers (for example Camden) that frequently contained brief local histories. The eighteenth century saw the emergence of county historians such as Nichols and Morant who were arguably the first local historians. These writers took an interest in subjects that are currently unfashionable (such as manorial descents), but often contain important details which can be used by a modern local historian. The nineteenth century saw the widespread publication of parish histories ‚Äì often written by the local minister. In 1879 Cox published the first edition of his How to Write the History of a Parish that would be used by local historians and genealogists for many years.Nick Poyntz, J. Charles Cox, Mercurius Politicus. Retrieved on 6 May 2017. In 1899, the Victoria County History project began to provide a sound academic basis for local history. The early twentieth century saw individuals in universities with job titles related to local history, but the first department of Local History was established at Leicester in 1947. Interest in local history expanded in the second half of the twentieth century both in numbers and scope. Contemporary researchers gather the conclusions from a wide range of academic disciplines.* Researching local history Local history research, like that of family history, is accessible to people without prior historical training or experience. This is because the very nature of local history is such that starting points are always available locally. An intelligent lay researcher can learn the necessary skills as they research. Archivists and societies can provide advice, encouragement, and information; formal courses of study are also widely available. Many local historians are non-specialists whose enthusiasm for history and have applied this to their area.Michael Williams, Researching local history: the human journey (Routledge, 2014). Most local history researchers follow a process in which they start from the basic facts offered by the available evidence, make a more detailed analysis of that evidence to explore its implications, and then put that analysis in its wider temporal and geographical context. Some take a more theoretical approach: starting from a hypothesis, which they seek to demonstrate or disprove through evidence.David Hey, Family history and local history in England (Routledge, 2014). Primary sources for local history The survival and availability of local records differ significantly from area to area. West J West, Village Records is a good guide to what records may exist and how they might be used. Similarly Iredale D Iredale, Enjoying Archives also describes where records may be found and how they can be used, although he originally wrote more than thirty years ago and is somewhat dated in parts. There are numerous guides to individual record categories NW Alcock, Old Title Deeds is a particularly good introduction to an under-used source for local history which can be found in bibliographies or referenced in more general works. Secondary sources for local history Where it exists, the appropriate volume of the Victoria County History (VCH) is the best starting point for a locality in England. There is often a local studies library which will contain a wealth of local material. Early county historians, e.g. Philip Morant and his History and Antiquities of Essex, often provide parish by parish accounts, although they frequently include long descriptions of manorial descents which are of little interest to the current generation of historians. If there is a history of the parish church, this may well contain useful material.William Edward Tate, The parish chest: a study of the records of parochial administration in England (Cambridge University Press, 1969).

Biography Palazzo della Signoria (Palazzo Vecchio), Florence Porcari was born into a wealthy family of Rome. He received a humanist education and became an admirer of the ancient Roman Republic. Porcari trained as a lawyer, and in 1427 and 1428 was elected capitano del popolo of Florence under the protection of Pope Martin V. There he met the humanist scholar Leonardo Bruni and the Camaldolese monk Ambrose Traversari. While in Florence, it was Porcari's habit, during public celebrations, to give speeches from a balcony on the Palazzo della Signoria, exhorting the people to honor justice, as the foundation of the commune. He then traveled to France and Germany.Ferdinand Gregorovius, History of Rome in the Middle Ages. After his return to Italy in 1430, he held several positions in Italian communes such as the podest√† of Bologna (1432), Siena (1434), Orvieto (1435) and was also governor of the fortress of Trani. He came back to Rome under the rule of Pope Eugenius IV. When the latter died and before the new pope was elected, he repeatedly addressed the populace to overthrow the papal rule, and to replace them by one based on the ancient Roman republic. The new pope, Nicholas V, pardoned him, but kept him away from Rome with several assignments. However, his participation in other plots (including one connected with the crowning of Frederick III in Rome), and an inflammatory speech in the Piazza Navona against the government, led the pope to exile him to Bologna. Roberto Cessi suggests that if this was taken as anything more than a criticism of the local city administrators, he would have been dealt with more harshly.Cessi, Roberto. Saggi romani, Vol. 1, Ed. di Storia e Letteratura, 1956, p. 56 In late December 1452 Porcari was able to escape and return to Rome. Here he organized an insurrection whose result would be the proclamation of the Republic and, for Porcari, the title of tribune, the same held by Cola di Rienzo in the 14th century. The action was set for the Feast of the Epiphany, 6 January 1453, and would be backed by some three hundred mercenaries. George of Trebizond claimed to have become aware of the conspiracy, through a disaffected priest, nearly a year before and attempted to warn Pope Nicholas.Monfasani, John. George of Trebizond: A Biography and a Study of His Rhetoric and Logic, BRILL, 1976, p. 83 Nicholas V, warned by Cardinal Basilios Bessarion that Porcari had disappeared, ordered investigations. Porcari had planned to arrest Nicholas at Old St. Peter's Basilica and kill members of the curia. Among the co-conspirators were Stefano Infessura and members of the Orsini. The conspirators were captured, including Porcari, who had tried to take shelter in the house of prince Latino Orsini. He was subsequently tried and hanged at Castel Sant'Angelo on 9 January 1453.Vanderjagt, Arjo. \\"The Case of Stefano porcari and the Christian Tradition\\", Antiquity Renewed: Late Classical and Early Modern Themes\\", (Vm Schmidt, Z.

The prisoner is strapped to a stretcher and executed inside the van. The van allows death sentences to be carried out without moving the prisoner to an execution ground. The vans also require less manpower per execution, requiring four persons to assist with the injection and are mobile. The PRC states that the vans are more humane than previous forms of execution. Human-rights groups predict that the execution rate in China will increase because of mobile capital punishment. People's Republic of China After the 1997 decision to legalize lethal injection as a form of execution, PRC officials began using execution vans across China. Becoming popular in 2007,Killing Vans Make Process Easier For China's Authorities, by The Irish Times these officials state that the vans are cost-effective by allowing communities without the money to build dedicated death rows to kill prisoners without the costs associated with sending prisoners away for death. Former Chinese judge and current lawyer Qiu Xingsheng argues that \\"some places can't afford the cost of sending a person to Beijing‚Äîperhaps $250‚Äîplus $125 more for the drug.\\" Because Beijing is the only place where the drug is manufactured, the vans have allowed localities to administer the death sentence where the crime took place. Estimates place the number of execution vans in operation at around 40; the PRC has not confirmed this number. A converted 24-seat bus, the execution van keeps the appearance of a normal police van on the outside with no markings indicating its purpose. The rear of the vehicle houses a windowless chamber where the execution takes place. Several cameras are present and feed closed-circuit televisions in the front of the van; a recording can be made if desired. The bed itself slides out of the wall under its own power, on which the convicted person is strapped down. A syringe is put into the arm by a technician and a police official administers the injection by pressing a button. Controversy The PRC government claims that this is a more humane form of killing people, being far less painful than firing squad executions. Zhao Shijie, president of the Yunnan Provincial High Court, was quoted as praising the new system: \\"The use of lethal injection shows that China's death penalty system is becoming more civilized and humane.\\" While the vans have moved China away from previous days of large public executions, human rights activists counter that they are \\"like government-sanctioned death squads\\", and allow for an increased number and a higher efficiency of executions. Notable executions On December 22, 2003, organized crime leader Liu Yong was executed in an execution van in a controversial ruling. Liu was convicted of 32 charges and sentenced to death in 2000, but was granted a reprieve after appealing the case on the grounds that his confession was forced. Liu had been given a retrial by the Supreme Court on December 17. It was the first time the Supreme Court had bypassed China's two-trial system in which two trials are permitted and the verdict of the second trial may be appealed by either side.China's Criminal Justice System - Yale Law School - Yale University (PDF). Retrieved 1 October 2011. On March 17, 2006, billionaire Yuan Baojing was executed in a van for the arranged murder of a blackmailer.

The main restaurant, which opened in 1979, is on Great Western Road in Aberdeen. There are other restaurants and takeaways in Banchory, Portlethen, Brechin, Dundee, Elgin, Ellon and Inverurie. By the mid-1990s the restaurant complex in Aberdeen had 300 seats and was open 7 days a week. In 2004, the chain served about 30,000 customers each week, selling approximately 18,000 fillets of fish. Its successful strategy is to buy fish of the best quality but to sell it at the same price as the competition. Its margins are therefore lower but it makes up for this with high volume, staying open from noon to 1 am, seven days a week, and being fairly busy throughout. Awards The Ashvale won many awards in the 1990s before it retired from competing: * Scotland's Fish and Chip Shop of the Year 1989/1990 * Scotland's Fish and Chip Shop of the Year 1990/1991 * Scotland's Fish and Chip Shop of the Year 1993/1994 * UK's Fish and Chip Shop of the Year 1990/1991 * UK Enterprise Award 1989/1990 * UK Enterprise Award 1990/1991 * UK Enterprise Award 1996/1997 The operations director, Stuart Devine, supports the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen and was awarded an MBE for his services to the seafood industry. The Whale The Ashvale's most famous dish is The Ashvale Whale which is a 1lb haddock fillet. To those who successfully complete the challenge of eating a Whale, a certificate is awarded, a commemorative mug may be purchased and another \\"Whale\\", or alternatively a dessert, is offered free of charge.

Synopsis A widow wanted her son to learn a trade. He insisted that he wanted to be a thief. She predicted he would end up hanging from a bridge. One day he did not go to church, and told her that the first trade she heard when she came out would be his. He came to the path and shouted \\"Thievery\\" in a disguised voice. She again predicted he would hang from the bridge but gave him to the Black Gallows Bird to learn the trade. The man taught him, and then said they must rob a man who had sold his cattle. On Halloween, they hid in the loft. The shifty lad went down and stirred up the cattle, sending people out; while they were gone, he stole nuts and sewed a leather hide to the thief. He cracked nuts, though the thief warned him he would be heard. He was heard, and the people came, and the thief ran off with the hide still attached. The people said he was stealing the hide and chased him. The Shifty Lad stole the gold and silver while they were gone, and brought them to the thief; they split them. Soon, a tenant sent a man to get a wether to give as a wedding gift. The Shifty Lad bet his master that he could steal it from the man's back. When he was coming, the lad put a dirty shoe in his path; the man said that if he had the other one, he would clean this one and have a pair. The Shifty Lad ran ahead of his, and put the shoe in the way again. The man went back to get the other, and the lad took the wether and the shoes and won his bet. The tenant sent the same man after a kid. The lad bleated like the wether, and when the man searched for it, thinking to come back with both, the lad stole the kid. The third time, the tenant directed him to never let the wether go, and so he brought it home. The shifty lad had his master hang him, and let him down when he kicked his legs. He praised it, and his master let him hang him, but the lad killed him. His wife was angry, and the lad fled. He took service with a wright who lived next to the king's storehouse, and broke into it to steal. The gifts persuaded the wright and his wife to let him. At the advice of the Seanagal, the king set a hogshead of pitch to catch the thief, and it caught the wright. The lad cut off his head to prevent their learning who he was. The king displayed the body to discover who grieved at the sight, but when the wright's wife cried out, he cut his foot and pretended she cried over that. Then the body was hung from a tree for the same reason. The lad took a horse with casks of whiskey by them, as if he were hiding from the soldiers. They chased him, and he fled, leaving the horse. They took it back, found the whiskey, and became drunk. The lad took the body. The king sent a black pig about to dig up the body. When it rooted about the wright's house, the lad sent the soldiers inside to eat and drink while it searched. He killed the pig and buried it while they ate. The king sent men to discover where people had pig's flesh they could not account for; the lad killed the soldiers sent to his house, and then started a rumor that the soldiers meant to massacre them, so all the people killed the soldiers. The Seanagal advised to give a ball, since the man would be the boldest and dance with the princess; when the lad did so, the Seanagal marked him with a black dot, but the lad saw it and marked the Seanagal himself with two and twenty other men with one. The king decided that he was beaten, and that he wanted so clever a man for his son-in-law. He had all the men with the black dots put in a room, and had a child give one an apple. The lad drew him with a shaving and a drone, and the child gave him the apple. They took the shaving and drone, but the child remembered them and still gave him the apple, so the shifty lad married the princess. One day, while they walked on the bridge, the lad told the princess that his mother said he would hang from that bridge. She said that if he wished to go over the wall, she would hold him by her handkerchief. He did, and hanged there, but a cry went up about a fire, startling the princess. She let go. The lad fell and died. Analysis Folklorist Joseph Jacobs, in his commentaries to the tale Jack, the Cunning Thief,Jacobs, Joseph. More Celtic Fairy Tales. New York. G. P.

The 230 acre campus is situated in Pawling, New York, a small hamlet in southern Dutchess County. It is located 60 miles north of New York City.  History  Trinity-Pawling School was founded in 1907 by Dr. Frederick Luther Gamage, who had previously been headmaster of St. Paul's School (Garden City, New York). The first school building was Dutcher House, a building which had previously had functioned as a hotel. Shortly after, George Bywater Cluett, who had previously donated money to Dr. Gamage for a gymnasium at St. Paul's, provided a larger grant for a new flagship building for the school that was then known as The Pawling School. In 1910, it moved to its current location on Route 22, in a new building designed by New York City architect Grosvenor Atterbury ‚Äì a building named Cluett Hall. The Pawling School was renamed Trinity-Pawling School in 1947. One of Trinity-Pawling's first students was William Bradford Turner, a descendant of the first Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor William Bradford. Turner was killed in action in World War One, and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.  A Trinity-Pawling Education  * The goal of a Trinity-Pawling education is to unlock the potential for greatness that exists in each boy. * The School pursues this goal through a vigorous learning environment that emphasizes 21st century skills such as innovation, creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. * A commitment to project-based and experiential learning acknowledges the research that has identified learning paradigms that prove to be successful for boys. * A camaraderie of \\"brotherhood\\" is enhanced by the mutuality of a family of educators and students who are dedicated to building a culture of excellence and honor. * The Trinity-Pawling learning experience combines a timeless commitment to character with a dedication to prepare young men for an ever-changing world.  The Practicum for Civic Leadership  At Trinity-Pawling, the Practicum for Civic Leadership allows students to learn how to think using a multi-disciplined approach to address a problem. The Practicum is broken down into 3 parts: the Senior Independent Project, the Winter Project, and the Global Collaborative Challenge. Each of these encourage students to work collaboratively to understand an issue, learn how to give an oral presentation both as part of a group and as an individual, and understand how to ask the right questions when confronted with a challenge are critical 21st century skills.  Senior Independent Project  During the spring term, rising seniors select a Senior Independent Project topic. Over the summer and throughout the fall term, each senior works on an independent project whereby he is linked with a faculty member and an alumnus or friend of the school. With guidance from both the assigned faculty member and mentor, each senior explores a specific topic in great detail. This part of the Practicum consists of an oral presentation, as well as a final presentation to the entire school using an alternative medium such as a chapel talk, newspaper article, T-P Ted talk, etc. Part of the exercise is figuring out how to share the findings with the school community.  Winter Projects  In the winter term, all non-juniors select from a broad range of interdisciplinary course offerings and pair up with two teachers (one from each discipline) on a project that requires using the tools from both disciplines. Students are also encouraged to design their own projects to fit their interests.  Global Collaborative Challenge  In the winter term, in lieu of a Winter Project, the entire junior class works on multiple global issues. The students are placed into random groups of five, and each group selects a global topic. They then present a solution to the topic in a 12-minute collaborative presentation to a group of faculty. After the presentation, the group must defend its position. The group is graded on its ability to address the enormity of the global topic, the depth of research, the quality of the presentation, the collaborative nature of the presentation and the group‚Äôs defense of its presentation.  The Effort System  One of the School\`s most distinctive attributes is its signatory Effort System, which began 45 years ago. Each boy at Trinity-Pawling is recognized and assessed in terms of the effort he devotes to a given endeavor: academics, athletics, dormitory responsibilities, civic engagement, attendance, and extracurricular programs. The learning objective inherent in this ethos of effort is to teach young people that the more they invest of themselves, the greater their accomplishments will be. The Effort System, then, becomes a pervasive characteristic of a boy\`s experience at Trinity-Pawling. Every six weeks, each student receives new effort grades. The faculty considers all aspects of each student's work: academics, dorm life, athletics, extracurricular involvement, campus service, and more. Students are then placed in Group 1 (highest) through Group 5 (lowest), depending on the commitment shown by a student to his peers, teachers, coaches, and most importantly, to himself.

Athletics  The school has 13 varsity sports which compete against Founder's League and non-league foes. The Founder's League comprises T-P, Kent, Taft, Avon, Hotchkiss, Choate, Kingswood-Oxford, Loomis Chaffee, and Westminster. Girls' schools in the league are Ethel Walker and Miss Porter's. In the fall, the boys compete in football, soccer and cross country. In the winter, the school offers wrestling, squash, skiing, hockey, and basketball. In the spring teams compete in track and field, baseball, tennis, golf, and lacrosse. There are lower teams for all of these sports, which routinely send players up to the varsity level. Facilities include the Smith Field House and a new turf field lined for soccer, football, and lacrosse. The field house was named for former headmasters Archibald Smith and Phillips Smith. The field was dedicated to long-time football coach, Associate Headmaster, and Director of Studies David N. Coratti, in the fall of 2013. Additionally, nine new tennis courts were completed in 2013. Tirrell Rink was renovated in 2010. Facility updates and additions were provided by the generosity of Trinity-Pawling alumni. The School offers six soccer fields, a newly-refurbished basketball court (Hubbard Court), a newly refurbished weight room, and a new cardio room. The Rock Squash Courts opened in 1999, and the McGraw Wrestling Pavilion opened in 1998. The baseball field was renovated and named for Mo Vaughn, Class of 1986. An all-weather track was installed in 2006, and a grass football field remains in use on the west side of Route 22.

The Gardiner Arts Center had formerly been the school's gym from 1911 to 1960 and then served as an auditorium until 2002. In this facility, students rehearse and work in acoustically-designed rooms for the choir, jazz band, string ensemble, and small practice rooms. Gardiner Theater is used for plays, musicals, and concerts. The stage has a full fly space and is surrounded by a set shop, dressing rooms, and a rehearsal room. Students interested in all aspects of theater production have a first-rate facility in which to learn their skills. The ground floor of Gardiner Arts Center is devoted to spaces for the visual arts. The Photo Lab has 12 enlargers and two other rooms for rolling film, drying and mounting prints, and storage. The Pottery Room has nine wheels, a slab roller, and three kilns for oxidation firings. A large painting and drawing studio can hold up to two classes at one time and the smaller Veith Studio is used by advanced students. All the studios have abundant natural light and special spotlights, and the student art work enlivens the hallways.  Clubs and Activities  There are 25-30 clubs and extracurricular activities offered to students each year. Some mainstays are Model UN, Diversity Club, Debate Club, Theater Tech Crew, Key Club (Admissions tour guides), and Film Club. Some more recent additions include Makers Club, fly-fishing club, and aviation club. Each student must participate in a club, program, or activity during their time at Trinity- Pawling.  Honor Code and Honor Council  The Honor Council is a student organization. Members are elected to the Honor Council by their peers and are responsible for upholding the Honor Code through personal example while also educating the student body in honorable behavior. An honor pledge is signed by all students and faculty at the beginning of each academic year as follows: > \\"Honesty and integrity live at the heart of the school. Behavior inspired by > faith and virtue creates honor in the academic community and allows us to > live by the principles of the Trinity-Pawling Honor Code: My efforts, > preparations, and presentation are at all times honest.\\" The mission statement of the Honor Council is as follows: > \\"We, the Honor Council, are formed by seven members of the student body. We > hope to encourage a community of character and mutual trust. We gather to > discuss honesty and integrity and ways to keep these honorable values at the > core of the school's identity.

It was published in 2000 by Wizards of the Coast. Characters *Kang - The Bozak commander of the all-draconian engineering unit the First Dragonarmy Engineers during the War of the Lance. *Slith - A Sivak who is the second-in- command, as well as Kang's best friend, adviser, and confidant. *Granak - A giant Sivak who is the standard bearer. *Gloth - A Bozak troop subcommander in charge of First Squadron. He has served with Kang and Slith since early in the War of the Lance. *Cresel - A Baaz draconian placed in charge of the female draconians. *Huzzad - A female Knight of Takhsis who is Kang's friend. *Maranta - General Maranta, the arrogant Aurak commander of a fort of Draconians that Kang and his unit encounter while fleeing from a pursuing goblin army. *Fonrar - A female bozak draconian who is a child, but the leader of the twenty female draconians. *Thesik - A female Aurak that is Fonrar's best friend. *Hanra and Shanra - Two female sivak sisters. *Riel - a female Baaz draconian who speaks for the other female Baaz Summary The book begins with Kang and his force of draconians preparing to ambush an army of goblins which are trying to destroy Kang's force because they have females. After springing the ambush, they find out that the goblins were aware of the ambush, and turned the ambush around on the draconians. Hobgoblins quickly appear, and so Kang tells his main force to retreat, while signaling a support force to cover. Meanwhile, on a hill a short distance away, the guarded female draconians notice that Kang's force is retreating, and becoming suspicious, they question the male draconians that are guarding them; however, realizing that they are being given an excuse, Fonrar sends in a sivak, Shanra, disguised as a male to discover the truth, since the female sivaks had an ability to blend in with their surroundings. Later, after Shanra returns, Fonrar and Thesik learn that the bozaks saw flashes of light in a nearby canyon. Knowing that the males wouldn't believe them, Fonrar and Thesik set out to learn more. After getting closer to the light, Fonrar accidentally trips, which causes the mysterious shapes that caused the light to question them. They are faced with answering, or getting attacked within five seconds, and so, Thesik and Fonrar jump onto a boulder to announce their presence. The moonlight shines off of Thesik's scales, revealing her as an aurak to the draconians that were the mysterious shapes. Back at the base, the hobgoblins attack, quickly overwhelming Kang's force. Kang and Slith prepare to make a bold stand when suddenly the hobgoblins retreat in a wild melee. Then, Kang hears giggles behind him, and turning around, sees Thesik, Fonrar, and the sivak sisters, Shanra and Hanra. The females announce that they brought reinforcements, salute (while giggling) him, and introduce Prokel, the subcommander of the Ninth Infantry. After introductions, Prokel leads Kang and his forces to a \\"fort\\", a ramshackle mess, evidenced by the collapsing guard towers. They meet the commander of the fort, General Maranta. Slith recalls a situation during the war against the elves when Slith kills a \\"pointy-eared female\\", then \\"does a dance\\" as the pointy-ear for the benefit of the troops. Maranta was surveying the camp at that time, and orders the pointy-eared female to be put under arrest. After learning it was Slith, he was given latrine duty for a month. Thankfully, Maranta doesn't remember any of that. Maranta calls of the commanders into the Bastion, a gigantic extremely well fortified building at the heart of the fort, and then introduces Kang to the rest of the commanders. Noticing that Kang had an aurak in his forces, he asks why Kang is in command. Kang then reveals the females, creating an enemy out of Maranta because Kang received the \\"glory\\" from Takhisis. Life in the fort continues, until Maranta discovers that the goblin horde didn't give up, and are gathering outside the fort to prepare for a siege. Obviously, this strains the relationship between Kang and Maranta. The females are forced to spend their lives within a wooden house, supposedly to protect them from other draconians, and so, begin to get bored. They decide to begin drills to prepare themselves to fight, and so the females ambush a draconian to get a requisition allowing them to get twenty swords from the quartermaster. At this time, Maranta decides to examine the females, and so when Cresel announces to the females that a visitor is coming, the females place a \\"water barrel drop\\", intending that it drops on Gloth's head. Unfortunately, when Maranta enters, the water barrel falls on him instead. Kang is sent to a nearby fort of Knights of Takhisis to ask for help. He learns that the Knights of Takhisis are actually paying the goblins to kill the draconians with the help of an informer, a female knight that he had met before, Huzzad. Huzzad is discovered by the Knights, and so is forced to escape with Kang. They return to the fort, where Maranta wants to torture Huzzad. Kang refuses to give her over, causing Maranta to tell Kang that he can have her for personal uses. Huzzad becomes a friend to the females, and learns about their secret abilities, like Kapak spit, which is like a healing salve, unlike the male Kapaks' poisonous spit. She also manages to persuade Kang to allow the females to parade and march with the males, forcing Kang to rethink whether the females still need to be \\"babied\\" anymore. The siege continues, with the draconians unable to break out. Kang and his forces begins to build an explosive fake dragon that can fly to scare the goblins, but by then is not welcomed by Maranta anymore. About this time, Kang begins to notice that his draconians are disappearing. Events reach a climax when the goblins attack the fort, causing Kang to admit that the females should be treated just like the rest of the males, and so, with the females, and Huzzad, enters the Bastion to search for Slith, one of the missing draconians. He finds out that Maranta has the Heart of Dracart, a magical orb that duplicates draconians by splitting the draconian's soul into hundreds of parts, or hundred of \\"new\\" draconians. Discovering that Maranta intends to do this to Slith, he and the females manage to kill Maranta. They attempt to leave the Bastion, but Maranta's personal guards attempts to stop them, with a crossbowman managing to fatally wound Huzzad. The females then become berserker-like by the death of their friend and kill almost all of the guards. Then, after finally exiting the bastion, they find that the goblins have breached the fort. Kang gives the command to release the fake dragon, and Thesik casts an illusion on the dragon to look like a real gold dragon. The dragon flies over the wall, but Kang realizes that the fuse for the explosives have gone out. He crushes the Heart of Dracart in his hand, mangling his hand, but gaining enough magical power to cast a fireball, which causes the dragon to explode, destroying part of the goblin army and the hobgoblin general. After the siege, Kang and the females conduct a funeral for Huzzad, and with the other draconian troops, heads to Teyr to establish their own draconian city. Kang also retires from being the commander due to personal reasons, and the fact that he can't fight well with his mangled hand anymore. He becomes the Governor of Teyr. The author also hints that Kang has fallen in love with Fonrar. Granak and several other characters from the alter-egos of users on a Dragonlance internet newsgroup.

Dipalpur tehsil is the largest tehsil of pakistan.Largest Tehsil of Pakistan - Laws of Pakistan It is situated 25 kilometres from the district capital Okara on a bank of the Beas River in Bari Doab.Location of Dipalpur - Falling Rain GenomicsTehsils & Unions in the District of Okara - Government of Pakistan It is located in the west of District Kasur. The Tehsil is notable for being the site of several battles in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and is also associated with the history of the Bhatti Rajput, dhudhi Rajput and Jat clan. Punjabi is the most spoken language in the region. Arain Kamyana, Begooka, Syed also named Bukhari Syed otherwise known as Gilani, Qazi, Sheikh, Khokhar, Wattoo, Bhatti, Pathan (Khan), Johiya, Jat, and Kharal, are the main castes. Wattoo, Arain, Bhatti Rajput, Johiya, Kharal, Khokhar are native whereas rest are migrants and settled after partition of India. Historical architecture In the past, Dipalpur was surrounded by a fortified wall, rising to the height of 25 feet and strengthened by a deep trench. When and by whom this wall was constructed is not known, but it was renovated, repaired and improved during the rule of Firuz Shah Tughluq and later by Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan, who was the governor during the time of Akbar. Firoz Shah Tughluq constructed a grand mosque and palaces. He also excavated a canal from the river Sutlej to irrigate gardens around the town. Wide and airy tunnels linked the royal residential quarters inside the fort to the adjoining gardens outside. There were 24 burgs (musketry holes) on the fortification wall, 24 mosques, 24 (ponds) and 24 wells at the town's peak. The trench, ponds and tunnels have been filled in, but in some places the location of the trench can still be defined. Most of the wall has been razed. Two of the four massive gateways with pointed arches also exist though they are badly damaged and their wooden doors have vanished. Later coats of cement have marred the original architecture of the gateways. Hindu monastery Besides doors with decorated latches, Jharokhas, bay windows and cut brick works, the most noticeable feature inside old Dipalpur is the monastery of Lal Jas Raj, a guru much venerated by the local people. According to the legend, Lal Jas Raj was the young son of Raja Dipa Chand, the founder of Dipalpur. He sank into the earth due to a curse by his stepmother Rani Dholran. Raja Dipa Chand constructed this monastery in the memory of his son. Today, the chamber is dilapidated, the doors are jammed and a stairway is used for storage. The structure itself is crumbling. According to local residents, there used to be a grand annual \\"mela\\" held here. It was also used by Hindus as a place to perform the Sardukahr (head-shaving ritual) until the partition, but \\"nobody comes anymore\\".  Caravanserai  Dipalpur's saray (inn) is near the monastery of Lal Jas Raj. It was a spacious building with airy rooms on four sides, a big courtyard in the centre and four arched entrances. The inn, like most of the older structures in town, is now in a state of disrepair. It has been divided and subdivided so many times by successive occupants that the original shapes are obscured. Even the verandas have been converted to create rooms. Saints Hujra Shah Muqeem Many Muslim saints have come to preach in this area. Bahawal Haq commonly known as Bahawal Sher Qalandar came from Baghdad and settled in the village of Patharwall near Dipalpur. The saint constructed a hujra (small living room) and a mosque outside the village. His grandson Shah Muqeem continued his mission. The village came to be known as Hujra Shah Muqeem. This is the place mentioned in the famous Punjabi love story Mirza Saheban, although there is no historical evidence that Jati Sahiba (Mirza Sahiba) came here and prayed that \\"The streets should desert when where my lover Mirza roams about\\". The Mughal Emperor Akbar, along with his son Saleem and royal entourage, stayed in Dipalpur when he came to pay homage to Farid Ganj Shakar in 1578. Akbar named the corridor Bari Doab by combining the syllables of the names of the two rivers, Beas and Ravi, that bounded the area. Baba Guru Nanak also stayed in Dipalpur for some time. The ruins of a Gurudwara mark the place. Muslim saint named as Saayi Abdul Razaq stayed in Dipalpur and later on he started his volunteer activity for local people and after his death he was buried in city. Now, his death place is known as Razaqia Darbar.

A well-known example involves doping in sport, where banned physical performance‚Äìenhancing drugs are used by athletes and bodybuilders. Athletic performance-enhancing substances are sometimes referred to as ergogenic aids. Cognitive performance-enhancing drugs, commonly called nootropics, are sometimes used by students to improve academic performance. Performance-enhancing substances are also used by military personnel to enhance combat performance.Anon. Better Fighting Through Chemistry? The Role of FDA Regulation in Crafting the Warrior of the Future. Food and Drug Law: Final Paper. March 8, 2004. The use of performance-enhancing drugs spans the categories of legitimate use and substance abuse.  Definition  The classifications of substances as performance-enhancing substances are not entirely clear-cut and objective. As in other types of categorization, certain prototype performance enhancers are universally classified as such (like anabolic steroids), whereas other substances (like vitamins and protein supplements) are virtually never classified as performance enhancers despite their effects on performance. As is usual with categorization, there are borderline cases; caffeine, for example, is considered a performance enhancer by some but not others.  Types  The phrase has been used to refer to several distinct classes of drugs: * Anabolic drugs build up muscle; examples include: steroids, hormones, most notably human growth hormone, as well as some of their prodrugs, selective androgen receptor modulators, and beta-2 agonists.Drug Enforcement Administration. November 2013 Clenbuterol * Stimulants improve focus and alertness. Low (therapeutic) doses of dopaminergic stimulants (e.g., reuptake inhibitors and releasing agents) also promote cognitive and athletic performance, as nootropics and ergogenic aids respectively, by improving muscle strength and endurance while decreasing reaction time and fatigue; some examples of athletic performance-enhancing stimulants are caffeine, ephedrine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. * Ergogenic aids, or athletic performance-enhancing substances, include a number of drugs with various effects on physical performance. Drugs such as amphetamine and methylphenidate increase power output at constant levels of perceived exertion and delay the onset of fatigue, among other athletic- performance-enhancing effects; bupropion also increases power output at constant levels of perceived exertion, but only during short term use. Creatine, a nutritional supplement that is commonly used by athletes, increases high-intensity exercise capacity. * Human biomolecules ‚Äì creatine and Œ≤-hydroxy Œ≤-methylbutyrate are naturally occurring compounds in humans that have well-established ergogenic effects and effects on body composition when supplemented. * Adaptogens are plants that support health through nonspecific effects, neutralize various environmental and physical stressors while being relatively safe and free of side effects. As of 2008, the position of the European Medicines Agency was that \\"The principle of an adaptogenic action needs further clarification and studies in the pre-clinical and clinical area. As such, the term is not accepted in pharmacological and clinical terminology that is commonly used in the EU.\\" * Nootropics, or \\"cognition enhancers\\", benefit overall cognition by improving memory (e.g., increasing working memory capacity or updating) or other aspects of cognitive control (e.g., inhibitory control, attentional control, attention span, etc.). * Painkillers allow performance beyond the usual pain threshold. Some painkillers raise blood pressure, increasing oxygen supply to muscle cells. Painkillers used by athletes range from common over-the-counter medicines such as NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) to powerful prescription narcotics. * Sedatives and anxiolytics are sometimes used in sports like archery which require steady hands and accurate aim, and also to overcome excessive nervousness or discomfort. Diazepam and propranolol are common examples; ethanol and cannabis are also used occasionally. * Blood boosters (blood doping agents) increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood beyond the individual's natural capacity. They are used in endurance sports like long-distance running, cycling, and Nordic skiing. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) is one of the most widely known drugs in this class. * Gene doping agents are a relatively recently described class of athletic performance-enhancing substances. These drug therapies, which involve viral vector-mediated gene transfer, are not known to currently be in use .  Usage in sport  In sports, the phrase performance-enhancing drugs is popularly used in reference to anabolic steroids or their precursors (hence the colloquial term \\"steroids\\"); anti-doping organizations apply the term broadly. There are agencies such as WADA and USADA that try to prevent athletes from using these drugs by performing drug tests. WADA was founded on November 10, 1999, by Dick Pound. The World Anti-doping Agency focuses on establishing and enforcing rules and codes for all sports around the world. Their goal is to make all sports played fairly between all athletes in a doping free organization with the power to prevent athletes from using any form of performance-enhancing drugs. USADA started October 1, 2000, as non-profit and was composed of nine members. Five of which were former Olympic athletes with the other four elected from independent companies. This is the United States Anti-doping Agency and have the ability to test athletes across the nation. Steroids and performance-enhancing drugs are used across all sports organizations around the world.

It is made out of khadi. It takes its name after the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, who first popularised its use during the Indian independence movement. Worn commonly by Indian independence activists, it became a symbolic tradition for politicians and political activists to wear it in independent India. Genesis Rare photograph of Mahatma Gandhi wearing Gandhi Cap in 1920 The Gandhi cap emerged in India during the First Non- cooperation movement during 1918‚Äì1921.Consumption: The history and regional development of consumption edited by Daniel Miller, p. 424 when it became the standard Congress dress as popularized by Gandhi. In 1921, the British government tried to ban the use of the Gandhi cap. Gandhi himself wore the cap only for one or two years during 1920‚Äì21.Gandhi was photographed wearing a turban or a round black topi in 1915 and 1918. He was photographed with the Gandhi cap in 1920. see 1915-1932 Mahatma Gandhi Photo Gallery http://www.mkgandhi.org/gphotgallery/1915-1932/index1.htm, Mahatma Gandhi, 1915 - 1920, Page 7 http://www.gandhimedia.org/cgi- bin/gm/gm.cgi?direct=Images/Photographs/Personalities/Mahatma_Gandhi/1915_-_1920&img;=90. By 1924 he had given up wearing a kurta and the cap. Also see http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1900_1999/gandhi/gandhigods/gandhigods.html Gandhi's homespun khadi attire of traditional Indian clothes were symbolic of his message of cultural pride, the use of Swadeshi goods (as opposed to those manufactured in Europe), self-reliance and solidarity with India's rural masses. The cap became common to most followers of Gandhi and members of the Indian National Congress. A connection to the independence movement was implied when any individual wore the cap in those times. Prisoners in South African prisons classified as \\"negroes\\" (a category into which Indians fell while Gandhi was in South Africa) also were required to wear similar caps in prison during 1907 to 1914. Gandhi's close friend Henry Polak cites Gandhi's time in South African jail, where he was classified as a \\"negro\\" and thus required to wear such a cap, as the genesis of the Gandhi Cap.H.S.L Polak Mahatma Gandhi (London: Odham's Press, 1949) pg. 61 Members of the Indian National Congress marching in New Delhi in 1937 However Gandhi, in a letter to Kaka Kalelkar, described in detail how he based his white cap on the Kashmiri cap.Clothing Matters: Dress and Identity in India, Emma Tarlo,University of Chicago Press, Sep 1, 1996.82-83 After independence The first generation of post-independence Indian politicians were almost universally members of the freedom struggle. Gandhi's assassination in 1948 gave an emotional importance to the Gandhi cap, which was regularly worn by Indian leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. Succeeding prime ministers such as Lal Bahadur Shastri and Morarji Desai would continue the tradition. Most members of the Indian Parliament (especially politicians and activists of the Congress party) wore khadi clothing and the Gandhi cap. Large numbers of people donned the cap while celebrating India's independence on August 15 or the promulgation of a republic on January 26. Jawarharlal Nehru was always remembered as having worn the cap. In 1964 a coin showing Nehru in profile was released which was widely criticized for lacking the cap. Another Nehru coin was later released in 1989 on his birth centenary, which showed him wearing a cap. In later times, the cap had lost its popular and political appeal. Although many members of the Congress party continued the tradition, rival political parties preferred to dissociate themselves from the tradition linked with the Congress. The mass acceptance of Western-style clothing had also diminished the importance of wearing Indian-style clothes for politicians. Wari, Dehugaon, Maharashtra The cap remains the most popular everyday headgear worn by men in rural parts of Maharashtra. Anna Hazare protesting against corruption In the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963, many people standing behind him on stage wore Gandhi caps. Re- emergence In 2011, the Gandhi cap once again rose in popularity in India after Anna Hazare, an eminent Gandhian from Maharashtra, started an anti- corruption movement in India. The epicenter of this movement was in Delhi. In August 2011, thousands of people wearing Gandhi caps accumulated at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi to support Anna Hazare on his fast-unto-death. This movement spilled over to many other parts of the country and stadiums, community centers and grounds were booked for assimilation of a similar nature. The mass movement witnessed people of all age groups, religions and social standings (mainly the middle class) as participants, many among them shouting slogans and wearing Gandhi caps. In the 2014 election, the workers of Aam Aadmi Party widely wore the Gandhi cap with text printed on it. Supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party wore a similar saffron colored cap.

Early life Khalil was born in Omdurman and was of Kenzi Nubian origin. In a place called balana in between the Egyptian and Sudanese territories. Military Service Khalil served in the Egyptian Army from 1910 to 1924, and the Sudan Defence Force from 1925 until 1944. He was the first Sudanese to reach the rank of Brigadier (Miralai). Political career In 1944 Khalil became an influential member of the Advisory Council for the Northern Sudan, which became a pro-Mahdist organisation. In 1945 Khalil helped found the Umma Party, and became the party's first Secretary General. In 1947 he became a member of the Independence Front, serving as a representative of Umma Party interests, opposing the dominant Khatmiyya interests. Khalil maintained a close relationship with Colonial Administrators Robert George Howe and J.W. Robertson, often serving as an advocate for their views on Sudanese politics. Khalil's constant struggle with the Khatmiyya is often criticized, with it being alleged that he helped to make the emerging Sudanese nationalism divisive and sectarian. Khalil was for instance appointed Minister of Agriculture in 1947, largely due to his insistence that this was necessary to counterbalance the strong role of the Khatmiyya and to respond to the Sudanization press. In 1948 Khalil became leader of the newly formed Legislative Assembly and Executive Council, serving the Umma Party's representative on the Constitutional Commission. Khalil was elected to parliament in the 1953 parliamentary election. Following the 1958 election Khalil formed a coalition government comprising his Umma Party and the People's Democratic Party.

The term \\"banana belt\\" is broad enough that it can be used to describe everything from the entire Antarctic Peninsula, to the southern part of American Midwest states, to microclimate areas of mountain ranges. Banana belts of the latter type may form on the lee sides of mountain slopes caused by orographic lift. When air rises over the top of a mountain range, it cools and releases moisture on the windward slope. As the air is pulled down the other side, it is compressed and heated via adiabatic heating, and it warms and dries territory in the mountain's rain shadow.

Floral tributes laid at official opening, 29 September 2006. Touchstones with names of police who died on duty. Honour roll with paved 'terrain' area and commemorative wall. Saint Michael, patron saint of policing. Design The two key elements of the design are: * a bronze commemorative wall with 'touchstone plaques' carrying the name and rank, date of death (day, month and year), and place of death, of police officers who have died whilst on active duty; * a large stone paved area or 'terrain' across which visitors move to gain access to the wall. The surface of the touchstone wall is clad in cast bronze panels with a slight textural feel and a dark patina. The surface of the cladding is smooth enough to allow the patina to have a gloss wax finish. The touchstones are also cast bronze but have a golden, almost polished patina, that will change over time with the degree to which each stone is touched. There are 1200 touchstones, which is meant to symbolise the ongoing danger for police on duty. The 'terrain' tilts to direct visitors to the wall, with undulations that is intended to create \\"an uncertainty in experience and reflects the uncertain path that police tread in the performance of their duty.\\" The design also incorporates elements acknowledging Saint Michael, the patron saint of policing. Access roads have been constructed from King's Avenue, joining to the previous the lakeside road. Design Competition A competition for the design was sponsored by the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC), launched on 2 March 2005 by Senator Christopher Ellison, the Federal Minister for Justice and Customs. 77 entries were submitted by its close on 29 April 2005. The memorial cost A$2.4 million. The winning entry was by Fairweather Proberts Architects (Brisbane).

Dedication of the NPM The Memorial was officially dedicated by Hon. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, on 29 September 2006, National Police Remembrance Day. The Master of Ceremonies was Ita Buttrose. More than 700 police from all states and the Australian Federal Police were gathered for the official opening, the first time since the opening of Old Parliament House in 1927 that there had been such a mass gathering of Australian police in Canberra.

It is the seventh book in the series concerning the exploits of Dr. Zeus Inc., otherwise known as The Company.  Plot introduction  Several elements introduced as far back as the fourth book The Graveyard Game develop in this volume. Most of the characters are immortal cyborgs created in the past by an organization, Dr. Zeus Inc., which exists in the 24th century and has both time travel and immortality technology. The official business of Dr. Zeus is the \\"finding\\", for a fee, of artifacts and living things thought lost to time, which have actually been carefully collected by the cyborgs known as Preservers, aided by the fixers, conmen and masters of deception known as Facilitators. Alec Checkerfield, introduced in The Life of the World to Come, is trying to find his lost love, the Preserver known as the Botanist Mendoza. With the aid of his AI helper \\"Captain Morgan\\" and their time travelling schooner using technology stolen from Dr. Zeus, he aims to find her wherever and whenever she is. This is complicated by the fact that he is hosting the personalities of his two dead clones, Nicholas Harpole and Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax, in his own partially cyborged body. All three personalities knew Mendoza in the flesh, so to speak, but each has his own way of looking at the world. Nicholas is a religious zealot, Edward a cold-blooded killer, and Alec is the squeamish product of a culture that prohibits or represses everything enjoyed by humans in the past, including religion, sex, and violence. The Facilitator Joseph is reviving his \\"father\\", the ancient Enforcer cyborg Budu, as the 24th century opens. To him, Alec Checkerfield represents his nemesis and the one responsible for the downfall of Mendoza, who he regards as a daughter. As Budu re-assembles his shattered body, Joseph plunders the archives of Dr. Zeus, learning about the Adonai project which created Alec, Nicholas and Edward. He tries to bring down Adonai by any means possible, including tracking Alec through time. Executive Facilitator Suleyman is using his power base in North Africa to prepare for the year 2355, when the Company apparently suffers such a setback that no transmissions from the time beyond have ever been received. He gathers trusted operatives to his base, while hoping that Joseph, whom he revived and cast out as a rogue, untraceable and answerable to nobody, will not bring disaster about by reviving Budu, the oldest and most powerful Enforcer. Budu is enduring the decades-long process of self-repair, having been buried for 370 years, body cut apart, in rubble after the San Francisco earthquake. He knows far more about the Company than Joseph dared believe. Passing this knowledge to Joseph, he prepares his own surprise for Dr. Zeus. Alec's AI, Captain Morgan, is also creating surprises to bedevil the Company in 2355. Alec drops these in strategic places at different times in history. Explanation of the novel's title Mendoza needs careful reviving after 900 years in the Company hell known as \\"Options Research\\". Since Capt. Morgan ran the apparatus that resulted in her rebirth, he likes to call her \\"the Machine's child\\". This is also a nod to a passionate conversation held by Mendoza and the first incarnation of the Adonai (Nicholas Harpole) during the 'first' novel of The Company stories, In the Garden of Iden. Plot summary At the end of The Life of the World to Come, Alec Checkerfield, aboard his schooner the Captain Morgan, crewed and piloted by the eponymous AI he created from a teaching computer given to him as a child, had escaped from Dr. Zeus' installation on Santa Catalina Island with information stolen from the Company databases. Using this information the Captain turned the ship into a time machine, leaving the year 2351 to hide in history. Along the way Alec found and lost Mendoza, unwittingly downloaded his alter egos into his own brain, and equally unwittingly was party to one of the most infamous massacres in human history, the destruction of the colony Mars Two by terrorists. As a result, Alec is wracked with guilt, and thus weakened he falls prey to the other personalities, especially the former assassin Edward. In a bizarre joint effort they break in and steal from the Nuevo Inklings in 2351 more information in the form of a buke, a 24th-century notebook computer. Thus fortified they disappear into time to plot the rescue of Mendoza. The Captain begins talking to the personalities individually as he creates the plan. Mendoza is in \\"Options Research\\", 300,000 years in the past. This is a facility dedicated to finding ways to kill cyborgs, using Preservers who have lost their will to live as guinea pigs. Only one Company operative is there, but it is Marco, the only Enforcer other than Budu to remain free once the Enforcers original mission was completed. Instead of being placed in suspended animation like the other Enforcers, he was sent to run Options Research where he systematically disassembles cyborgs and subjects them to horrendous treatments in an attempt to destroy them. Alec and the Captain arrive from the future, with Edward in control of their body to carry out the mission. This is fortunate, as the horrors created by Marco sicken Nicholas and Alec. They find Mendoza, who has been lying in a steel coffin for 900 years, disabling Marco in the process. The Captain has duplicated the virus that brought down Budu, although Edward is only able to inject it by sheer luck. Mendoza is in dreadful condition; her coffin is only 1 meter long. In the year 2317, Joseph is still waiting for Budu to finish regenerating after rescuing him in 2276. He lives in a corner of the revival facility under Mount Tamalpais, near San Francisco, stealing food, clothing and other equipment as he needs them. Lately he has been playing the role of visiting handyman and lover to Mavis, the landlady of the nearby Pelican Inn. Budu finally awakes, despite being blind and unable to communicate. Joseph steals a vocoder and hooks it into Budu's systems so he can hear and talk. Budu tells his story about what happened to him after he escaped from Company custody in 1099. Becoming a rogue like Joseph, he roamed Europe until the Black Death gave him the idea of using disease to cull humanity of its violent members. Contacting his various recruits, like Labienus, he formed the Plague Cabal, which began creating diseases designed to kill target populations quickly and then die out before spreading to the rest of humanity. Labienus, however, had visions of reducing human population on a global scale, committing genocide, and caused Budu's downfall at the hands of Victor, who had unwittingly been made into a carrier of targeted viruses. Joseph finds a time-travel capsule that Budu had hidden on Morro Rock and goes to Options Research in search of Mendoza. He arrives well after Alec has left, and is attacked by Marco even as he lies ill with the virus. After Marco calms down, he tells Joseph what happened, before wading into the sea, presumably to hide himself from the Company, who he now believes is after him. Joseph, horrified by what he sees and failing to find Mendoza, returns to the 24th century and contacts Suleyman, who mounts a mission to rescue the cyborgs held at Options Research and expose it to all the other active Company operatives still alive. With knowledge supplied by Budu, Joseph begins to ransack Company databases for information about Mendoza, his friend Lewis, and the Adonai project which created Alec, Edward and Nicholas. Over the last few decades he had lost some of his grip on reality and thus became obsessed with destroying Adonai. Knowing that Alec is born in 2320, he brings Alec's \\"parents\\", the Earl and Countess of Finsbury, to the Pelican so he can prevent Alec's conception. To his dismay he finds that they had long ago decided not to have children and Roger had been medically sterilized. In reality, Alec was born to a host mother and given to the Checkerfields by the Company. Alec and his phantom companions are finally able to hold their beloved once the Captain, using his own version of the Company revival tank, rebuilds her. She has lost most of her memories, though there are indications the Captain may have blocked them to protect her sanity. One side effect is that the Company conditioning which suppressed her paranormal abilities has been removed, and she constantly creates temporal anomalies around her when her emotions are aroused. The typical result is that plants seem to grow with incredible speed. The ship is soon a floating greenhouse. The Captain meanwhile has been digesting the Company data. He can make Alec immortal like Mendoza, who thinks he is already immortal like her. He can create devices using nanotechnology that the Company, slow and bureaucratic, had never thought to build. Alec and Mendoza proceed to drop small time-bombs in the form of collections of nanobots throughout history. Meanwhile, a search for Alec's original genetic template, which the Captain needs for the immortality treatment, turns up the mortal remains of both Edward and Nicholas, hidden in Company repositories; this is a shock for each of Alec's mental passengers. Eventually they locate Alpha-Omega, a secret facility where genetic templates for all operatives, and indeed every kind of human who has ever existed, are stored. Before doing this Alec insists on a vacation, and since he is obsessed with his romantic vision of pirates, he decides to go to Port Royal, Jamaica, in its heyday before being destroyed by an earthquake in 1692. Joseph and Budu have been studying Alec, and have realized that he is likely to visit Port Royal. Joseph sets himself up in the less rowdy inland community of Spanish Town, ready to wait years for their arrival, equipped with a device that can detect and jam the Captain's signals. Alec arrives with Mendoza, though he is quickly repelled by the place, and is only able to continue with help from Edward and Nicholas, who are not bothered by such horrors as abattoirs, meat markets, pet animals, thugs and pirates. By way of celebrating their impending triumph over Dr. Zeus, Alec and Mendoza, helped considerably by Nicholas' passion and poetry, marry themselves and enjoy a belated honeymoon in a harbor inn. Joseph has had the misfortune to be away from his home when his alarm is activated, and when he returns the couple are gone. After an exhausting journey he finds the Captain Morgan at anchor and sneaks aboard, after disabling the Captain with a signal jammer. Confronting the man he thinks of as Alec Checkerfield, he is astonished to be attacked by the Nicholas personality. Knocking Alec out, he interrogates him when he revives, but finds himself dealing with Edward. At that point Mendoza erupts from the cabin of the ship, and the Captain defeats the jamming and activates the ship's defenses. Mendoza does not recognize Joseph, who realizes that whatever he thinks, Alec, Edward and Nicholas genuinely love her. He flees and returns to Budu. From Budu's point of view, Joseph has been gone a few days. From Joseph's viewpoint, it has been 20 years. Alec's injuries from the fight require even more recuperation. In a resort in 2276 they play a violent video game that is illegal in Alec's time. Edward beats the game, literally burning it out. As a result, he becomes Alec's equal in cyberspace, though this is unknown to the others. Finally raiding Alpha-Omega, on an island in 500,000 BCE, they bypass the AI and the single human attendant it protects, and recover the Adonai genetic template. With the Captain distracted by the other AI, Edward takes over Alec and confines the other personalities to a virtual prison. His bravado is short-lived, however. Alec and Nicholas attempt to escape, distracting Edward when he is attacked by an ichthyosaur while wading into the sea. Gravely injured, he attempts to transfer his personality into Mendoza's systems, but the result leaves her catatonic. The Captain is left to pick up the pieces. The final scene is enigmatic, and a cliff hanger. Mendoza is \\"rebooted\\", but the Captain seems to have obtained human form. He implies that Alec and Nicholas are still trapped in Mendoza's mind and, strangely, calls her \\"mother\\". Characters * Mendoza, a significant character in three previous books and an important voice in the series, is relatively passive and almost silent in this story. Having lost most of her memory she is only aware that she loves plants and has encountered Alec, or Edward, or Nicholas before and loved him/them. In this state, however, her unleashed paranormal ability, generating \\"Crome radiation\\", allows the AI Captain Morgan to find a way to bring Mendoza into her own future, which for her is after 1863. * Joseph has also lost much of what made him tick. He has lost the thing he needed most, to belong to the Company. Instead he finds refuge in his attachment to Budu, his father, and his desire for justice for Mendoza and his other lost friends. * Budu does not emerge much in the story, merely providing a way for Joseph to get access to information, money, and equipment. His resources and the nature of his plan to bring down Dr. Zeus are not revealed, although they apparently involve an immortal William Randolph Hearst, posing as his own descendant. * Alec, along with Nicholas and Edward, becomes outwardly more stable even as the older personalities become stronger. Nicholas expounds on his Christian faith and how it fails to explain his current situation. Edward expresses his faith in Reason, shorn of passion and superstition, as the only hope for them and humanity. Alec represents the third aspect of history, as Edward sees it. If Nicholas is Faith and Edward is Reason, Alec is blind Technology which has no purpose until Reason takes control of it. * Captain Morgan, once a mere teaching machine, has grown beyond reason until he can accomplish almost anything for Alec. Only when Edward impetuously disconnects the device linking Alec to the Captain, or when the Captain's systems are jammed, does the human part of the symbiosis function as an independent actor. When the Captain is in charge, Alec's personalities have little to do but argue with each other. * Marco the Enforcer, as described in Sky Coyote, wanted to lead his own army of Enforcers to purge humanity of killers and other malefactors once the original mission of stopping the pernicious Great Goat Cult was complete. Instead he was sent into the past to run Options Research. Having created cyborgs that are literally indestructible, the Company is desperate to find ways to destroy them. * William Randolph Hearst, as related in a story \\"Welcome to Olympus, Mr. Hearst!\\" in Gods and Pawns, has been given a version of immortality by the Company, and masquerades as his own descendant in 2320. His part in the plan is yet to be revealed. Major themes Beginning with the first volume the series concentrated on telling small stories in a large context. Much space was given to period detail, in Elizabethan England, pre-Spanish California, Old California during the American Civil War, and various future events, both real and imagined. With the fourth volume, The Graveyard Game, a transition to exposition of the greater plot took place, though period vignettes appeared as well. This volume is heavy on plot exposition but also returns to earlier themes, allowing the author to revel in her knowledge of Elizabethan English once more, as in In The Garden of Iden. Real people such as William Shakespeare and Robert Louis Stevenson appear. Alec is an admirer of Stevenson for writing Treasure Island, his favorite book. Edward is a great admirer of Shakespeare. Both are apparently important to the author, also. Alec and the Captain pursue their mission in stages while Joseph, in pursuing Alec, becomes aware of the larger Adonai plot, discharging his obsession with Nicholas Harpole and the safety of Mendoza. This clears his mind to concentrate on dealing with the future, and finding his other lost friends. Alec himself has to reconcile himself to his past crimes before his deathwish brings him, and his co-personalities, to an untimely end. He also has to avoid a takeover by Edward, who is learning how to \\"write code\\" in their shared virtual world. Edward may not have a deathwish, but his recklessness poses just as much risk. Nicholas' passion can also endanger their body, as when he takes over in his rage to attack Joseph, who is physically capable of breaking him in two. Suleyman and his allies are mostly on the sidelines, bearing witness to the coming of a future they dread as the long-awaited signs, such as the Company issuing badges consisting of a clock with no hands, begin to appear. The appearance of a live ichthyosaur at the end echoes Mendoza's discovery of a recently dead member of that species during her exile on Santa Catalina Island, as recounted in The Life of the World to Come. Since both events take place in times millions of years after the supposed extinction of ichthyosaurs, this may imply that time is somehow \\"out of joint\\" around Company bases. Company stories such as \\"The Catch\\", as well as The Life of the World to Come, refer to \\"variable permeability of the time continuum\\" occurring when a particular time and place has repeated time journeys made to it.

The black-and-white film is partially animated, partially live-action. It follows the story of Gilbert, a man whose wish that he never sees a spring again is granted by Coily the Spring Sprite, who makes springs vanish. Plot Mrs. Willoughby confirms that her husband, Gilbert, cannot join his friends as he is repairing their sofa. He wishes to never see another spring again, and his wish is granted by Coily the Spring Sprite. Gilbert cannot effectively use his pocketwatch; his blind; his telephone; his door; or his car. Whenever he tries to use something that requires a spring, Coily shouts \\"No springs!\\" and laughs. Coily agrees to take back Gilbert's wish, and the latter is able to repair his sofa and then head out with his friends. While they play golf, he explains the science and uses of springs, spring action, and elasticity to his friends. He continues to talk about springs as they drive home, boring them. In exasperation, a friend starts to wish that he never sees another spring again, but Gilbert stops him. Coily reappears, and laughs. Analysis Though a documentary, A Case of Spring Fever eschews some features typical of the genre, instead dramatizing its events and introducing a supernatural character. It also has a parodic or mockumentary character; Gilbert is a comic figure who is infantilized by his wife and subsequently bores his friends. Nonetheless, Gilbert's claims about springs are presented as factual. For Donald Levin, \\"the film's use of the codes and conventions of the documentary work to increase our understanding about our shared social world, and at the same time critique and parody Gilbert's (and, by extension, its own) attempt to communicate that understanding\\". Legacy A Case of Spring Fever was parodied in \\"Bart the Lover\\", a season three episode of The Simpsons, in which an educational film about zinc includes a supernatural being who makes all zinc disappear. The film was also the subject of mockery in the 12th episode of the tenth season of Mystery Science Theater 3000 alongside the 1976 horror film Squirm. Chris Morgan called the short film \\"a worthy choice for the final short [featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000], a strange film with an even stranger premise\\".

Since July 2012, it has been operated by international services company Serco. History NorthLink Ferries logo used from 2002-2013  NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries  The subsidised Northern Isles ferry services, previously run by P&O; Scottish Ferries, were put out to tender in 1999. A joint venture between Caledonian MacBrayne and The Royal Bank of Scotland, named NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries, won the contract and began operation in October 2002. A variety of factors, including competition from rival operator Pentland Ferries, the Norse Island Ferries group created by local hauliers concerned about NorthLink's proposed freight pricing, and higher-than-expected operation costs, contributed to financial difficulties within the company. In response, the Scottish Executive Transport Group (now Transport Scotland) made additional subsidy payments of ¬£0.6 million and agreed to restructure subsidy payment timing. In mid-2003 the company indicated that it would be unlikely to complete its contract due to the ongoing financial difficulties. NorthLink defaulted on its lease payments for the vessels in July and August 2003, and in April 2004 the then Scottish Executive announced that the service would be re-tendered due to NorthLink's inability to fulfil the terms of its contract. The company continued to operate under interim arrangements until April 2006 while a new contract was secured.  NorthLink Ferries Limited  On 19 July 2005, the Scottish Executive announced that three companies - V-Ships, Irish Continental Ferries and Caledonian MacBrayne - had bid to provide ferry services to the Northern Isles. Irish Continental, however, withdrew its bid in October 2005, leaving two potential operators on the closing date of 1 December 2005. Both of the remaining bids complied with the contract requirements, but Caledonian MacBrayne's lower bid meant that it was awarded the contract. Caledonian MacBrayne formed a company named NorthLink Ferries Limited, which adopted the branding and vessels of its predecessor, and began operating the Northern Isles ferry services on 6 July 2006.  Serco NorthLink Ferries  The Northern Isles ferry service was re-tendered in 2011/12 as NorthLink Ferries Limited's contract came to an end. Initially, the contract's two services (Aberdeen-Lerwick and Scrabster-Stromness) were to be de-bundled. Eligible bids for the services were received from Pentland Ferries (which expressed interest in the Scrabster-Stromness service only), Sea-Cargo A/S (which expressed interest in the Aberdeen-Lerwick service only), P&O; Ferries, Shetland Line (1984) Limited (part of local haulage and freight company Streamline Shipping Group), Serco, and the incumbent NorthLink Ferries Limited. The Scottish Government subsequently re-bundled the routes, when insufficient interest was shown in the separate routes. On 4 May 2012, Transport Scotland announced that Serco was the preferred bidder. This decision was legally challenged in the Court of Session by rival bidder Shetland Line (1984) Limited on the basis that the Scottish Government had allegedly not taken into account that they had scored higher than Serco for their proposed service - suspending the securement of the contract. On 29 May 2012 however, the court overturned the suspension and Serco was confirmed as the new operator, ending Caledonian MacBrayne's 10 year involvement with Northern Isles ferry services. The contract lasts for a period of six years and is worth ¬£243m. Serco, using the vessels and branding of its predecessor, began operation of Northern Isles ferry services at 15:00 on 5 July 2012. It stated that it planned to make no changes to fares or timetables for the remainder of 2012, and that it planned to \\"overhaul catering, seating and onboard entertainment\\" in future. MV Hrossey departing Aberdeen Harbour, Scotland. Current fleet branding in use since Spring 2013. In Spring 2013 NorthLink rebranded and launched new on board services such as \\"sleep pod\\" reclining seats and a premium lounge. The contract was due to end in 2018, but Serco received an 18-month extension. Arguments have been put forward by the RMT union to bring the service into public ownership. In February 2020, Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, announced that NorthLink's contract would be re-awarded by the end of March. Services Map of ferry services in Scotland NorthLink operates two passenger routes: *Scrabster to Stromness, Orkney (90 minutes) *Aberdeen to Lerwick, Shetland (12 hours 30 minutes northbound; 12 hours southbound). Some services also call at Kirkwall, Orkney, which increases the journey time by 2 hours. Fleet Currently the NorthLink fleet consists of: *, on the Pentland Firth route, 112 m long * and , sister ships, on the Aberdeen to Lerwick via Kirkwall route, 125 m long both in service since 2002 * and , sister ships, used for freight and livestock to Orkney and Shetland, sailing from Aberdeen.

It is a cognitive model that describes how people actually make decisions rather than a rational or normative theory that prescribes what people should or ought to do. It is also a dynamic model of decision making rather than a static model, because it describes how a person's preferences evolve across time until a decision is reached rather than assuming a fixed state of preference. The preference evolution process is mathematically represented as a stochastic process called a diffusion process. It is used to predict how humans make decisions under uncertainty, how decisions change under time pressure, and how choice context changes preferences. This model can be used to predict not only the choices that are made but also decision or response times. The paper \\"Decision Field Theory\\" was published by Jerome R. Busemeyer and James T. Townsend in 1993.Busemeyer, J. R., & Townsend, J. T. (1993) Decision Field Theory: A dynamic cognition approach to decision making. Psychological Review, 100, 432‚Äì459.Busemeyer, J. R., & Diederich, A. (2002). Survey of decision field theory. Mathematical Social Sciences, 43(3), 345-370.Busemeyer, J. R., & Johnson, J. G. (2004). Computational models of decision making.

The DFT has been shown to account for many puzzling findings regarding human choice behavior including violations of stochastic dominance, violations of strong stochastic transitivity, violations of independence between alternatives, serial position effects on preference, speed accuracy tradeoff effects, inverse relation between probability and decision time, changes in decisions under time pressure, as well as preference reversals between choices and prices. The DFT also offers a bridge to neuroscience. Recently, the authors of decision field theory also have begun exploring a new theoretical direction called Quantum Cognition. Introduction The name decision field theory was chosen to reflect the fact that the inspiration for this theory comes from an earlier approach ‚Äì avoidance conflict model contained in Kurt Lewin's general psychological theory, which he called field theory. DFT is a member of a general class of sequential sampling models that are commonly used in a variety of fields in cognition. The basic ideas underlying the decision process for sequential sampling models is illustrated in Figure 1 below. Suppose the decision maker is initially presented with a choice between three risky prospects, A, B, C, at time t = 0. The horizontal axis on the figure represents deliberation time (in seconds), and the vertical axis represents preference strength. Each trajectory in the figure represents the preference state for one of the risky prospects at each moment in time.Figure 1 ‚Äî Sample paths for a diffusion process Intuitively, at each moment in time, the decision maker thinks about various payoffs of each prospect, which produces an affective reaction, or valence, to each prospect. These valences are integrated across time to produce the preference state at each moment. In this example, during the early stages of processing (between 200 and 300 ms), attention is focused on advantages favoring prospect C, but later (after 600 ms) attention is shifted toward advantages favoring prospect A. The stopping rule for this process is controlled by a threshold (which is set equal to 1.0 in this example): the first prospect to reach the top threshold is accepted, which in this case is prospect A after about two seconds. Choice probability is determined by the first option to win the race and cross the upper threshold, and decision time is equal to the deliberation time required by one of the prospects to reach this threshold. The threshold is an important parameter for controlling speed‚Äìaccuracy tradeoffs. If the threshold is set to a lower value (about .30) in Figure 1, then prospect C would be chosen instead of prospect A (and done so earlier). Thus decisions can reverse under time pressure. High thresholds require a strong preference state to be reached, which allows more information about the prospects to be sampled, prolonging the deliberation process, and increasing accuracy. Low thresholds allow a weak preference state to determine the decision, which cuts off sampling information about the prospects, shortening the deliberation process, and decreasing accuracy. Under high time pressure, decision makers must choose a low threshold; but under low time pressure, a higher threshold can be used to increase accuracy. Very careful and deliberative decision makers tend to use a high threshold, and impulsive and careless decision makers use a low threshold. To provide a bit more formal description of the theory, assume that the decision maker has a choice among three actions, and also suppose for simplicity that there are only four possible final outcomes. Thus each action is defined by a probability distribution across these four outcomes. The affective values produced by each payoff are represented by the values mj. At any moment in time, the decision maker anticipates the payoff of each action, which produces a momentary evaluation, Ui(t), for action i. This momentary evaluation is an attention-weighted average of the affective evaluation of each payoff: Ui(t) = Œ£ Wij(t)mj. The attention weight at time t, Wij(t), for payoff j offered by action i, is assumed to fluctuate according to a stationary stochastic process. This reflects the idea that attention is shifting from moment to moment, causing changes in the anticipated payoff of each action across time. The momentary evaluation of each action is compared with other actions to form a valence for each action at each moment, vi(t) = Ui(t) ‚Äì U.(t), where U.(t) equals the average across all the momentary actions. The valence represents the momentary advantage or disadvantage of each action. The total valence balances out to zero so that all the options cannot become attractive simultaneously. Finally, the valences are the inputs to a dynamic system that integrates the valences over time to generate the output preference states. The output preference state for action i at time t is symbolized as Pi(t). The dynamic system is described by the following linear stochastic difference equation for a small time step h in the deliberation process: Pi(t+h) = Œ£ sijPj(t)+vi(t+h).The positive self feedback coefficient, sii = s > 0, controls the memory for past input valences for a preference state. Values of sii < 1 suggest decay in the memory or impact of previous valences over time, whereas values of sii > 1 suggest growth in impact over time (primacy effects). The negative lateral feedback coefficients, sij = sji < 0 for i not equal to j, produce competition among actions so that the strong inhibit the weak. In other words, as preference for one action grows stronger, then this moderates the preference for other actions. The magnitudes of the lateral inhibitory coefficients are assumed to be an increasing function of the similarity between choice options. These lateral inhibitory coefficients are important for explaining context effects on preference described later. Formally, this is a Markov process; matrix formulas have been mathematically derived for computing the choice probabilities and distribution of choice response times. The decision field theory can also be seen as a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics. Explaining context effects The DFT is capable of explaining context effects that many decision making theories are unable to explain. Many classic probabilistic models of choice satisfy two rational types of choice principles. One principle is called independence of irrelevant alternatives, and according to this principle, if the probability of choosing option X is greater than option Y when only X,Y are available, then option X should remain more likely to be chosen over Y even when a new option Z is added to the choice set. In other words, adding an option should not change the preference relation between the original pair of options. A second principle is called regularity, and according to this principle, the probability of choosing option X from a set containing only X and Y should be greater than or equal to the probability of choosing option X from a larger set containing options X, Y, and a new option Z. In other words, adding an option should only decrease the probability of choosing one of the original pair of options. However, empirical findings obtained by consumer researchers studying human choice behavior have found systematic context effects that systematically violate both of these principles. The first context effect is the similarity effect. This effect occurs with the introduction of a third option S that is similar to X but it is not dominated by X. For example, suppose X is a BMW, Y is a Ford focus, and S is an Audi. The Audi is similar to the BMW because both are not very economical but they are both high quality and sporty. The Ford focus is different from the BMW and Audi because it is more economical but lower quality. Suppose in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y. Next suppose a new choice set is formed by adding an option S that is similar to X. If X is similar to S, and both are very different from Y, the people tend to view X and S as one group and Y as another option. Thus the probability of Y remains the same whether S is presented as an option or not. However, the probability of X will decrease by approximately half with the introduction of S. This causes the probability of choosing X to drop below Y when S is added to the choice set. This violates the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y, but when S is added, then Y is chosen more frequently than X. The second context effect is the compromise effect. This effect occurs when an option C is added that is a compromise between X and Y. For example, when choosing between C = Honda and X = BMW, the latter is less economical but higher quality. However, if another option Y = Ford Focus is added to the choice set, then C = Honda becomes a compromise between X = BMW and Y = Ford Focus. Suppose in a binary choice, X (BMW) is chosen more often than C (Honda). But when option Y (Ford Focus) is added to the choice set, then option C (Honda) becomes the compromise between X (BMW) and Y (Ford Focus), and C is then chosen more frequently than X. This is another violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because X is chosen more often than C in a binary choice, but C when option Y is added to the choice set, then C is chosen more often than X. The third effect is called the attraction effect. This effect occurs when the third option D is very similar to X but D is defective compared to X. For example D may be a new sporty car developed by a new manufacturer that is similar to option X = BMW, but costs more than the BMW. Therefore, there is little or no reason to choose D over X, and in this situation D is rarely ever chosen over X. However, adding D to a choice set boosts the probability of choosing X. In particular, the probability of choosing X from a set containing X,Y,D is larger than the probability of choosing X from a set containing only X and Y. The defective option D makes X shine, and this attraction effect violates the principle of regularity, which says that adding another option cannot increase the popularity of an option over the original subset. DFT accounts for all three effects using the same principles and same parameters across all three findings. According to DFT, the attention switching mechanism is crucial for producing the similarity effect, but the lateral inhibitory connections are critical for explaining the compromise and attraction effects. If the attention switching process is eliminated, then the similarity effect disappears, and if the lateral connections are all set to zero, then the attraction and compromise effects disappear. This property of the theory entails an interesting prediction about the effects of time pressure on preferences. The contrast effects produced by lateral inhibition require time to build up, which implies that the attraction and compromise effects should become larger under prolonged deliberation (see ). Alternatively, if context effects are produced by switching from a weighted average rule under binary choice to a quick heuristic strategy for the triadic choice, then these effects should get larger under time pressure. Empirical tests show that prolonging the decision process increases the effects and time pressure decreases the effects. Neuroscience The Decision Field Theory has demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioral decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviorally-derived diffusion models of decision making. The decision processes of sensory-motor decisions are beginning to be fairly well understood both at the behavioral and neural levels. Typical findings indicate that neural activation regarding stimulus movement information is accumulated across time up to a threshold, and a behavioral response is made as soon as the activation in the recorded area exceeds the threshold. A conclusion that one can draw is that the neural areas responsible for planning or carrying out certain actions are also responsible for deciding the action to carry out, a decidedly embodied notion. Mathematically, the spike activation pattern, as well as the choice and response time distributions, can be well described by what are known as diffusion models‚Äîespecially in two-alternative forced choice tasks.For a summary, see Diffusion models, such as the decision field theory, can be viewed as stochastic recurrent neural network models, except that the dynamics are approximated by linear systems. The linear approximation is important for maintaining a mathematically tractable analysis of systems perturbed by noisy inputs. In addition to these neuroscience applications, diffusion models (or their discrete time, random walk, analogues) have been used by cognitive scientists to model performance in a variety of tasks ranging from sensory detection, and perceptual discrimination, to memory recognition, and categorization. Thus, diffusion models provide the potential to form a theoretical bridge between neural models of sensory-motor tasks and behavioral models of complex-cognitive tasks.

Alvarez manufactures steel-string and classical guitars, ukuleles and, for a time, solid and hollow-body electric guitars and basses.  History  In the late 1960s, St. Louis Music's founder, Gene Kornblum, met Kazuo Yairi, a Master Luthier in Japan who produced handmade concert classical guitars. Together, St. Louis Music and the Yairi factory started to design and develop steel string acoustic guitars and imported them into the United States. The guitars took the brand name of St. Louis Music's Spanish guitar line ‚ÄúAlvarez‚Äù. Similar instruments were also sold under the factory brand of ‚ÄúK. Yairi‚Äù in Europe and other parts of the world. From 2005 to 2009, the brand was owned by LOUD Technologies, which also owns Mackie, Ampeg, Crate and other music-related brands. In 2009, Mark Ragin (owner of US Band & Orchestra and St. Louis Music) brought the management and distribution of the guitars back to St. Louis Music. As early as 2011, SLM senior vice president Chris Meikle has acted as Alvarez head of development, overseeing the redesign of Artist Series and other modelsand rolling out new instrument lines such as the 2014 Masterworks Series, the Alvarez 50th anniversary 1965 Series, Alvarez-Yairi Honduran Series and the Grateful Dead Series. While many of its models are produced in China, the top-tier Alvarez-Yairi instruments are handmade at the Yairi factory in Kani, Gifu-Japan, part of the legacy of Kazuo Yairi, the late master luthier. Every Alvarez guitar undergoes a full set up and inspection in their guitar shop in St. Louis, Missouri.  Series  Alvarez Guitars manufactures many models of guitar which are categorized by price point and specialty into series.  Regent Series  Alvarez considers Regent Series a high quality entry-level line of guitars designed to give younger players and players new to the instrument a positive learning experience. In 2018 Alvarez released the Regent School Series designed specifically for students. The nut width is slimmer than the standard size and the neck has been custom shaped to be comfortable for smaller hands.  Artist Series  Alvarez has stated that its goal with Artist Series is to deliver pro level guitars at excellent value through the close attention to detail. Alvarez Artist Series has won several awards, including a 5/5 rating in Acoustic Guitar Magazine and a nomination for best guitar series from The Music and Sound Retailer.In 2017 Artist Series began adding new key features and models including armrests, travel guitars like the Delta DeLite and LJ2, and ATR (Advanced Tonal Response) system.  Masterworks Series  An Alvarez Masterworks Series Parlor Guitar with shadowburst finish and inlays In 2014 Alvarez introduced the Masterworks Series featuring all solid wood construction and high end appointments such as gold tuners, ebony bridge pins, mother of pearl inlays and maple or koa binding. In 2019 Alvarez introduced bluegrass focused Masterworks models, the MF60OM and the MD60BG, that feature construction that emphasizes response when playing with a plectrum and flatpicking.

It is most commonly used to compare the results of protein structure prediction to the experimentally determined structure as measured by X-ray crystallography or protein NMR. The GDT metric as described by its autor Adam Zemla is intended as a more accurate measurement than the more common RMSD metric, which is sensitive to outlier regions created for example by poor modeling of individual loop regions in a structure that is otherwise reasonably accurate. GDT_TS measurements are used as major assessment criteria in the production of results from the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP), a large-scale experiment in the structure prediction community dedicated to assessing current modeling techniques and identifying their primary deficiencies. In general, the higher GDT_TS is, the better a given model is in comparison to reference structure. The GDT score is calculated as the largest set of amino acid residues' alpha carbon atoms in the model structure falling within a defined distance cutoff of their position in the experimental structure, after superimposing the two structures. By the original design (Patent No.: US 8,024,127 B2) the GDT algorithm calculates 20 GDT scores, i.e. for each of 20 consecutive distance cutoffs (0.5 √Ö, 1.0 √Ö, 1.5 √Ö, ... 10.0 √Ö). For structure similarity assessment it is intended to use the GDT scores from several cutoff distances, and scores generally increase with increasing cutoff. A plateau in this increase may indicate an extreme divergence between the experimental and predicted structures, such that no additional atoms are included in any cutoff of a reasonable distance (see GDT plots). The conventional GDT_TS total score in CASP is the average result of cutoffs at 1, 2, 4, and 8 √Ö. The original GDT_TS is calculated based on the superimpositions and GDT scores produced by the Local Global Alignment (LGA) program. A high accuracy version called GDT_HA is done by selection of smaller cutoff distances (half the size of GDT_TS) and thus is more rigorous. It was used in the high accuracy category of CASP7. CASP8 defines a new \\"TR score\\", which is GDT_TS minus a penalty for residues clustered to close, meant to represent steric clashes invented by the predictor, sometimes to game the cutoff measure of GDT.. Related page The primary GDT assessment uses only the CŒ± atoms. To apply superposition‚Äêbased scoring to the functional ends of protein sidechains, a GDT‚Äêlike score called global distance calculation for sidechains (GDC_sc) has been designed and implemented within the LGA program in 2008. Instead of comparing residue positions on the basis of CŒ±s, GDC_sc uses a characteristic atom near the end of each sidechain type for the evaluation of residue‚Äìresidue distance deviations. An \\"all atoms\\" variant of the GDC score (GDC_all) is calculated using full-model information, and is one of the standard measures used by CASP's organizers and assessors to evaluate accuracy of predicted structural models.

Before the Acts of Union 1707 unified England and Scotland (abolishing the unicameral Scottish Parliament), the Lords Temporal were all members of the Peerage of England (which for this purpose included Wales). All holders of those titles (who were not disqualified for some reason) continued to have seats until the reforms of composition after 1997. For the representation of other geographical peerages see below. From the Reformation until 1801 the Lords Spiritual were all members of the Church of England, the Anglican church which operated in England and Wales in that period. For the changes in the geographical areas covered by the Lords Spiritual see below. Removal of the abbots and priors, 1539-40 Powell and Wallis in The House of Lords in the Middle Ages discuss the disappearance of the abbots and priors, who had been amongst the Lords Spiritual previously summoned to Parliament, when a new Parliament met on 28 April 1539. > Six of the abbeys whose heads were on the standard list of summonses to > parliament ‚Äì Abingdon, Battle, Hyde, St Augustine's Canterbury, Shrewsbury > and Bardney ‚Äì had voluntarily surrendered to the vicar-general, Cromwell, in > the course of 1538, Coventry had followed in January 1539, and Tavistock on > 3 March, two days after the issue of the parliamentary writs.

Removal of the Lords Spiritual, 1642 The right of the Lords Spiritual to sit in the House of Lords was removed during the Long Parliament under the Clergy Act 1640 (passed in 1642). As this legislation had passed both Houses and received royal assent, the Royalists accepted it was a valid law. After the restoration of the monarch in 1660 the Lords Spiritual were readmitted to membership of the House of Lords when the Clergy Act 1661Chronological table of the statutes; HMSO, London. 1993. was passed. Abolition of the House of Lords, 1649 On 19 March 1649 the House of Commons abolished the House of Lords. This revolutionary action did not obtain the consent of either Lords or the King and so it was not recognised as a valid law after the restoration of the King. The first part of the abolishing Act was as follows. > The Commons of England assembled in Parliament, finding by too long > experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of > England to be continued, have thought fit to ordain and enact, and be it > ordained and enacted by this present Parliament, and by the authority of the > same, that from henceforth the House of Lords in Parliament shall be and is > hereby wholly abolished and taken away; and that the Lords shall not from > henceforth meet or sit in the said House called the Lords' House, or in any > other house or place whatsoever ... Re-establishment of the House of Lords, 1660 The Lords Temporal resumed meeting as the House of Lords, in the Convention Parliament which restored the monarchy.Briefing on the history of the House of Lords on its official website Re-admission of the Lords Spiritual, 1661 The Clergy Act 1661 permitted the prelates of the Church of England to resume sitting as members of the House of Lords. Representation of the peerages of Scotland and Great Britain from 1707 Under the Treaty of Union and subsequent legislation, the Kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain. From 1707 no further Peers of England or of Scotland were created. New titles were created in the Peerage of Great Britain and these conferred seats in the House of Lords. The Peerage of Scotland were not all given seats in the House of Lords. Instead they were allowed to elect representative peers to each parliament. See List of Scottish representative peers. Article XXII of the Treaty of Union provides: The Church of Scotland was not given any representation in the House of Lords, so the existing Lords Spiritual were unaffected by the Union. Representation of the peerages of Ireland and the UK from 1801 Under the Act of Union 1800 the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were merged to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 January 1801. No further peers of Great Britain were created, although the power to create new Irish peerages in certain circumstances was retained and exercised in the nineteenth century. New titles created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom conferred a seat in the House of Lords. The Peerage of Ireland was represented in the House of Lords by twenty eight representative peers, elected for life. See List of Irish representative peers. Representation of the Church of Ireland from 1801 The Anglican church in Ireland, the Church of Ireland, was the established church of the country at the time of the Union. The Archbishops and Bishops of that church were given representation in the House of Lords. Under the provisions of the Act of Union 1800, one archbishop and the three bishops chosen by rotation (changing for each session of Parliament) would be Lords Spiritual in the newly united United Kingdom House of Lords in Westminster, joining the two archbishops (Canterbury and York) and the twenty-four bishops from the Church of England. Exclusion of life peers by prerogative, 1856 In 1856 an attempt was made to use the royal prerogative to create a life peer. This was a revival of a royal power unused (for male recipients) since the reign of King Richard II of England. In the Wensleydale Peerage Case (see Peerage law) the House of Lords decided that peers created for life were not entitled to a seat in the House. Removal of the Irish Lords Spiritual, 1871 Though the religion of a minority of Irish people at the time, the Church of Ireland remained the official, established religion of Ireland, until its disestablishment by the Irish Church Act 1869 came into effect in 1871. The representation of the Church in the House of Lords also ceased. Admission of the Law Lords, 1876 Eminent lawyers were appointed as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary from 1876. Originally they held seats in the House of Lords only until they retired as law lords (similarly to the practice for Bishops), but in 1887 the seats were conferred for life. See List of law life peerages. Removal of the Welsh Lords Spiritual, 1920 The Church of England was disestablished in Wales with the Welsh Church Act 1914 (with implementation delayed until 1920 due to the war). The bishops of the new Church in Wales ceased to be eligible to become Lords Spiritual in Parliament. Removal of the representative peers of Ireland, 1922-1961 Peers in the Peerage of Ireland elected representative peers for life from the Union of 1801 until the Irish Free State became an independent Dominion in 1922. The last Irish representative peer died in 1961. Admission of life peers by statute, 1958 From 1958 life peers, in the degree of Baron or Baroness, were created. For the first time women became eligible to sit in the House of Lords. Since 1964 almost all peerages have been created in this category. Peerage Act 1963 The Peerage Act 1963 had three significant yet distinct effects on the House of Lords; introducing the right of hereditary peers to renounce an inherited title, allowing female hereditary peers to take a seat in Parliament for the first time, and withdrawing the restrictions on the number of Scottish peers that could sit in the House of Lords.  House of Lords Act 1999  The House of Lords Act 1999 withdrew the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords as the first stage of a planned reform by the Labour government of Tony Blair. However 92 hereditary peers were allowed to remain pending completion of the second stage of the proposed reforms.  House of Lords Reform Act 2014  The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 allowed members to resign from the House; previously there was no mechanism for this. It also allowed for the (non-retrospective) exclusion of any peer convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year or more. House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 The House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 authorised the House to expel or suspend members. Reforms of powers Originally the two Houses of Parliament had equal legislative powers. The agreement of both was necessary before a Bill could be submitted to the Monarch for royal assent, which if granted made the Bill an Act of Parliament. After the English Restoration a constitutional convention arose that the House of Lords would defer to the House of Commons on measures to raise and spend money. This did not affect the legal powers of the House of Lords. After the split in the Liberal Party over the First Irish Home Rule Bill in 1886, most Whig aristocrats left the Gladstonian Liberal party and became Liberal Unionists. The effect was to reinforce an already large Conservative majority in the House of Lords. Liberal governments in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century had difficulty in getting major legislation through the upper house. On issues as central to the politics of the day as Home Rule and as dear to the hearts of radicals as the end of plural voting, the Lords were implacably opposed.  Parliament Act 1911  When in 1909, the House of Lords rejected the Finance Bill (giving effect to the People's Budget which imposed new taxes on landowners), a constitutional crisis arose when the Liberals ideally wanted to reduce the power of the Lords. The crisis of the Finance Bill was resolved by the January election of 1910 after which the Lords passed the bill, but it did not end the constitutional crisis. A compromise was not found until after the December election of 1910 when a bill was produced dealing only with the powers, but promising in the preamble to reform the house on a popular basis. The Parliament Act 1911 divided Bills into three classes. # Money bills, which could be given royal assent without the Lords' approval if they did not consent within one month. #On most other bills the House of Lords was given a suspensory veto. If the Commons passed the same measure in three successive Parliamentary sessions, covering at least two years, then it could become law without the agreement of the Lords. #The remaining class related to bills to extend the maximum term of the House of Commons beyond five years. The House of Lords retained equal legislative power for those Bills.  Parliament Act 1949  Since 1911 there have been various attempts to reform the Lords, but none tackled the powers of the House except the Parliament Act 1949 which reduced the suspensory veto to two sessions and one year. By the time of the 1997 UK election there was still no consensus about a comprehensive reform of the upper chamber of Parliament.  References  * The House of Lords in the Middle Ages, by J.

The HHS is accredited against the Australian Commission on Healthcare Standards and in 2017- 2018 demonstrated achievement against prescribed measures in the HHS Strategic Plan 2014-2018 (2017 Update). These included a decrease in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rate of discharge against medical advice, improved treat and seen-in-time rates, an increase in followers on social media and a budget surplus. History There have been three general hospitals in Townsville over the city's 150-year history. The First Townsville Hospital was established in 1882 in North Ward.Townsville Council website: A Chronological History of Townsville 1770 to 1900 The two story brick building accommodated 70 patients. When Cyclone Leonta struck Townsville in May 1903 it caused extensive local damage and the hospital partially collapsed.Townsville Council website: A Chronological History of Townsville 1901 to 1969 The Second Townsville General Hospital opened in North Ward on 21 April 1951. The old Townsville General Hospital psychiatric service was the focus of intense scrutiny in the 1980s after it was revealed 65 people had died in the psychiatric ward. The deaths and subsequent inquest gave rise to the Burden Inquiry, Report of the National Inquiry into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness 1990. The North Ward hospital could not expand any further due to its urban location and was regularly reaching absolute capacity. However the heritage-listed hospital buildings, with their landmark white art deco appearance, enviable location, and water views, were retained and were turned into exclusive apartments. The third and current Townsville hospital at Douglas began construction in 1998 and opened in 2001.Townsville Council website: A Chronological History of Townsville 1970 to 2003 It is co-located with the James Cook University.

Colonnade Building, 1926, Coral Gables The Colonnade Building at 133-169 Miracle Mile was designed in 1926 by Phineas Paist in collaboration with Walter De Garmo and Paul Chalfin in a mixture of Spanish Colonial and Baroque. The main purpose, in Merrick's planning, was to house his growing sales operation. Since the 1920s, the Colonnade has had many tenants including the Colonnade Movie Studios and a World War II parachute factory. Today it houses an hotel and office building designed by Spillis & Candela. The downtown commercial district was once serviced by a free trolley that ran down Ponce de Leon Boulevard, the main artery bisecting the business district. The old trolley system was replaced by the popularity of modern automobiles until a new free \\"trolley system\\" (buses with a \\"retro\\" trolly-like livery) was initiated in November 2003. After declines during the Great Depression and World War II, developers and business took to rebranding the area to turn it into a \\"high-end shopping destination.\\" Through this vision and investment effort, the area was named Miracle Mile in 1955. George K. Zain and his wife Rebyl Zain contributed their leadership, enthusiasm and faith to the conception of the high-end shopping boulevard. Zain created a plan to resolve the solution to parking and built parking garages in the area.

For example, if a job becomes vacant, more than one person may be reassigned to different tasks or ranks on the basis of who has worked for the organisation longer. As the next person assumes the duties of the person who has vacated, now the job of the replacement person likewise becomes vacant and must thus be filled by the next person with the appropriate seniority level.

Most are multicellular, but goblet cells are single-celled glands. Mucous salivary glands The mucous salivary glands are similar in structure to the buccal and labial glands. They are found especially at the back part behind the vallate papillae, but are also present at the apex and marginal parts. In this connection the anterior lingual glands require special notice. They are situated on the under surface of the apex of the tongue, one on either side of the frenulum, where they are covered by a fascicle of muscular fibers derived from the styloglossus and inferior longitudinal muscles. They produce a glycoprotein, mucin that absorbs water to form a sticky secretion called mucus. They are from 12 to 25 mm. long, and about 8 mm. broad, and each opens by three or four ducts on the under surface of the apex.

Mr. Joseph G. Grose began work as a leather currier in Ambush Street, St. James' End, Northampton. He took an interest in cycle racing and held several national records before becoming a cycle repairer and maker. In 1897 he invented the Grose patent gear case made of leather that covered the cycle's driving mechanism to protect ladies' skirts from catching in the chain. This sold in large numbers and was so successful that the Grose Gear Case Company Ltd. was formed in July 1897 to manufacture it. The case was later used to cover the drive chain of early motor cars. He was sufficiently successful to be able in 1897 to run the first motor car in the town, a Coventry Motette. Following this he bought six Benz engines and fitted them to his own chassis and sold them as the Grose-Benz. In February 1900 the Company's name was changed to Grose Ltd and the gearcase business was sold and the factory in Pike Lane, Northampton was adapted to manufacture \\"Grose\\" Steel Studded Non-Skid Tyres, which Joseph Grose had invented for his newly built motor cars. The business continued to expand moving into motorcycle sales and repairs, coachbuilding, commercial vehicle building and operating. A fleet of taxi-cabs was purchased in 1908 and operated from Pike Lane, the first motor taxi-cabs in Northampton. In 1912 Grose Ltd. registered a subsidiary company, Northampton Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. operating local routes until 1928\\\\. Many of their buses had Grose- built bodies. As well as producing some individual car bodies the company specialised in short production runs of standard designs. The first designs were for a two seat and dickey sports body and were first fitted to the Alvis 12/40 and 12/50 models.Nick Walker. A-Z of British Coachbuilders. Bay View Books 1997. In the 1930s Grose was listed as an approved coachbuilder by several major manufacturers including Rover with the Kingsley drophead coupe and Vauxhall. In 1935 the Riley Motor Company was added with two drophead designs called the Burcote and the Horton. The names were taken from Northamptonshire villages. In the late 1920s Joseph Grose's children entered the business with Will Grose as Managing Director, Frank Grose as Sales Director and Kate as Company Secretary. Joseph died in 1939 and his children continued to run the Company. The company took a stand at the London Motor show for many years with their final appearance in 1936. Car body making continued until 1939 and commercial bodies until 1959. Grose continues in Northampton as car dealers, latterly Vauxhall agents, into the 21st century.

He is known as one of the teachers of Sofonisba Anguissola and of Giovanni Battista Trotti (il Malosso). In Cremona, his extended family owned the main artistic studios. Giulio Campi and Antonio Campi, half-brothers, were distant relatives of Bernardino; the latter is generally considered the most talented of the family. All were active and prominent painters locally. Influences on Bernardino include local Cremonese such as Camillo Boccaccino and artists from neighboring regions such as Correggio, Parmigianino and Giulio Romano. He made a number of sets of copies of the Eleven Caesars by Titian, then in the Gonzaga collection, adding one of Domitian, which he based on a work by Giulio Romano. Titian's originals were all lost in an 18th-century fire in Madrid. Bernardino was commissioned by Vespasiano Gonzaga to lead a team of artists including Pietro Martire Pesenti in the interior decoration, including frescoes by Bernardino, of the Palazzo del Giardino in Sabbioneta, near Mantua. Among his pupils were Giovanni Antonio Morandi (active 1585), Andrea Mainardi, and Pietro Martire Pesenti, both active in the Palazzo of Guastalla.Gli artisti italiani e stranieri negli stati estensi catalogo storico ...

Dollard hosted a web-only radio show called \\"The Jihadi Killer Hour\\" at Blog Talk Radio from May 2008 to August 2010.Pat Dollards Jihadi Killer Hour site at Blog Talk Radio His guests included Hollywood, Interrupted author Mark Ebner, Matt Drudge's former partner Andrew Breitbart (founder of websites Breitbart and Big Hollywood), Media Malpractice: How Obama Won The Election director John Ziegler, Jihad Watch's Robert Spencer, independent war correspondent Michael Yon, conservative pundit and former \\"Politically Incorrect\\" staff writer Evan Sayet, Brothers At War director Jake Rademacher, African-American comedian Zo, Harlem Pastor James Manning, and conservative comedian Steven Crowder. Iraq War project While still running a management company, representing Soderbergh and helping to service Soderbergh and George Clooney's production company at Warner Brothers' (Section 8 Films), in 2004 Dollard decided to do a side project for a few weeks in three combat zones in Iraq: Fallujah, The Triangle of Death, and Ramadi. The project began as a 2‚Äì4 week rapid-production documentary project, but eventually grew to include a 7-month stay in Iraq with a Marine unit and over 200 hours of footage. The resulting documentary, Young Americans, has been released in segments on the Internet and clips have been shown on television. Dollard and footage from Young Americans are featured in a new French documentary for Canal Plus called Hollywood and Politics, directed by David Carr Brown. Political views Dollard has argued that there were more important reasons for the Iraq war than weapons of mass destruction: \\"The root causes of terrorism are the lack of capitalism, the lack of democracy, and the lack of modern education.\\" Dollard contends that the Iraq War has successfully removed some of the barriers to the causes of terrorism in the Middle East. On April 2, 2014, after the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, Dollard caused controversy by tweeting: > If there is even one more act of Muslim terrorism, it is then time for > Americans to start slaughtering Muslims in the streets, all of them. Dollard did not apologize for the tweet but suggested it was not to be taken seriously.

Product certificates are awarded by national schemes on the basis of evaluations carried by independent testing laboratories. A Common Criteria testing laboratory is a third-party commercial security testing facility that is accredited to conduct security evaluations for conformance to the Common Criteria international standard. Such facility must be accredited according to ISO/IEC 17025 with its national certification body. Examples List of laboratory designations by country: *In the US they are called Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL) *In Canada they are called Common Criteria Evaluation Facility (CCEF) *In the UK they are called Commercial Evaluation Facilities (CLEF) *In France they are called Centres d‚ÄôEvaluation de la S√©curit√© des Technologies de l‚ÄôInformation (CESTI) *In Germany they are called IT Security Evaluation Facility (ITSEF) Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) or Common Criteria Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) is an international agreement that recognizes evaluations against the Common Criteria standard performed in all participating countries. There are some limitations to this agreement and, in the past, only evaluations up to EAL4+ were recognized. With on-going transition away from EAL levels and the introduction of NDPP evaluations that ‚Äúmap‚Äù to up to EAL4 assurance components continue to be recognized. United States In the United States the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) accredits CCTLs to meet National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme requirements and conduct IT security evaluations for conformance to the Common Criteria. CCTL requirements These laboratories must meet the following requirements: * NIST Handbook 150, NVLAP Procedures and General Requirements * NIST Handbook 150-20, NVLAP Information Technology Security Testing ‚Äî Common Criteria * NIAP specific criteria for IT security evaluations and other NIAP defined requirements CCTLs enter into contractual agreements with sponsors to conduct security evaluations of IT products and Protection Profiles which use the CCEVS, other NIAP approved test methods derived from the Common Criteria, Common Methodology and other technology based sources. CCTLs must observe the highest standards of impartiality, integrity and commercial confidentiality. CCTLs must operate within the guidelines established by the CCEVS. To become a CCTL, a testing laboratory must go through a series of steps that involve both the NIAP Validation Body and NVLAP. NVLAP accreditation is the primary requirement for achieving CCTL status. Some scheme requirements that cannot be satisfied by NVLAP accreditation are addressed by the NIAP Validation Body. At present, there are only three scheme-specific requirements imposed by the Validation Body. NIAP approved CCTLs must agree to the following: *Located in the U.S. and be a legal entity, duly organized and incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state where the laboratory intends to do business *Accept U.S. Government technical oversight and validation of evaluation-related activities in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the CCEVS *Accept U.S. Government participants in selected Common Criteria evaluations. CCTL accreditation A testing laboratory becomes a CCTL when the laboratory is approved by the NIAP Validation Body and is listed on the Approved Laboratories List. To avoid unnecessary expense and delay in becoming a NIAP-approved testing laboratory, it is strongly recommended that prospective CCTLs ensure that they are able to satisfy the scheme-specific requirements prior to seeking accreditation from NVLAP. This can be accomplished by sending a letter of intent to the NIAP prior to entering the NVLAP process. Additional laboratory-related information can be found in CCEVS publications: * #1 Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme for Information Technology Security ‚Äî Organization, Management, and Concept of Operations and Scheme Publication * #4 Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme for Information Technology Security ‚Äî Guidance to Common Criteria Testing Laboratories Canada In Canada the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) Canadian Common Criteria Scheme (CCCS) oversees Common Criteria Evaluation Facilities (CCEF).

They are common in popular music, and most medleys are songs rather than instrumentals. A medley which is a remixed series is called a megamix, often done with tracks for a single artist, or for popular songs from a given year or genre. A cover version combining elements of multiple pre-existing songs is a cover medley. A medley is the most common form of overture for musical theater productions. In Latin music, medleys are known as potpourr√≠s or mosaicos; the latter were popularized by artists such as Roberto Faz and Billo Fr√≥meta, and most commonly consist of boleros, guarachas, merengues or congas.

The gabled roof has slate shingles. Brick chimneys are located at each end of the house. A central front door is set under an arched wooden frame with a fanlight over the door. In the 1800s, tiny brackets were installed over the earlier dentil trim and a -story addition was added to the west side. A front porch was added around 1910. The Trach-Hunsicker House has historic importance due to its builder, Rudolph Trach (Drach or Drough). As a child, Trach emigrated from Germany to Bedminster, Bucks County, where he learned to be a potter. Upon moving to Monroe County, Trach constructed the house and established a pottery on the property. Some of his work was functional, but some was created in the ornate sgraffito style. One signed and dated sgraffito pie plate produced at the Trach-Hunsicker property is held by the Winterthur Museum, Delaware. Trach lived in the house until his death. The surname Hunsicker applies to the owners who renovated the structure and applied for listing. In 1980, the property was approved for listing on the Pennsylvania Inventory of Historic Places and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission indicated that the \\"property appears to meet the National Register criteria.\\".Zacher, S.M., National Register Coordinator, Office of Historic Preservation. Letter to Mr. & Mrs. Edward Hunsicker. 25 November 1980. Monroe County Planning Commission, Stroudsburg, PA. In 1983, a further letter from the Commission's Chief of Preservation Services re-iterated that \\"the resource appears to meet the National Register criteria and to have a nomination priority as established by the Historic Preservation Board.\\"Ramsey, G., Chief, Division of Preservation Services, Bureau for Historic Preservation. Letter to Janet Wetzel. 15 March 1983. Monroe County Planning Commission, Stroudsburg, PA. No record of a National Register nomination is available. Hikes-Hunsinger House The Hikes-Hunsinger House has been listed in the National Register (#75000769) since October 10, 1975. It is an 1824 Federal style residence located at 2834 Hikes Lane, Louisville, KY. Residence of early Louisville pioneers Charles Edward Hunsinger and Paulina Crawford Hikes. Nearby Hunsinger Lane remains a significant local thoroughfare. Dr. Charles Hunsucker House and Office Two historic structures located in the Claremont neighborhood of Hickory, North Carolina were built for Dr. Charles Lamar Hunsucker (1890‚Äì1965), medical practitioner and lay leader of the Corinth Reformed Church. The Hunsucker House, located at 266 Fifth Avenue, NE, is a two-story, brick-veneered residence with low hipped roof, dentiled cornice, hip-roofed dormers and a three-bay facade. The front porch flows into a porte-cochere. The Hunsucker House was designed by architect Q.E. Herman and built in 1921‚Äì1922. The Hunsucker Office, located at 421 Third Street, NE, is a -story, brick-veneered building with front and side gables and a three-bay facade with a central, gabled entrance. The Hunsucker Office was built in 1952 and used by Dr. Hunsucker for his medical practice. Unzicker-Cook House The Unzicker- Cook House is located at 2975 Oxford-Middletown Road, Milford Township, Butler County, Ohio. The site is just east of Ohio 177 (Hamilton-Richmond Road) near Oxford. The house is named for Daniel Unzicker (1798‚Äì1863) and his wife, Magdalena Kahn (1803‚Äì1880). Daniel Unzicker was a Mennonite preacher and farmer from Bavaria, who arrived in Butler County in 1828 and built the house around 1831. The house has a fieldstone foundation and fieldstone and weatherboard walls The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 24 July 1974. References External links *B-levi.com: O.

The region is known as Futa Toro. Origins Futa Toro is a strip of agricultural land along both sides of the Senegal River. The people of the region speak Pulaar, a dialect of the greater Fula languages spanning West Africa from Senegal to Cameroon. They identify themselves by the language, which gives rise to the name Haalpulaar'en (those who speak Pulaar). The Haalpulaar'en are also known as Toucouleur people, a name derived from the ancient state of Takrur. From 1495 to 1776, the country was part of the Denanke Kingdom. The Denianke leaders were a clan of non-Muslim Fulbe who ruled over most of Senegal. A class of Muslim scholars called the Torodbe seem to have originated in Futa Toro, later spreading throughout the Fulbe territories. Two of the Torodbe clans in Futa Toro claimed to be descended from a seventh-century relative of one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad who was among a group of invaders of Futa Toro. The Torodbe may well have already been a distinct group when the Denianke conquered Futa Toro. In the last quarter of the seventeenth century the Mauritanian ZawƒÅyƒÅ reformer Nasir al-Din launched a jihad to restore purity of religious observance in the Futa Toro. He gained support from the Torodbe clerical clan against the warriors, but by 1677 the movement had been defeated. After this defeat, some of the Torodbe migrated south to Bundu and some continued on to the Futa Jallon. The farmers of Futa Toro continued to suffer from attacks by nomads from Mauritania. By the eighteenth century there was growing resentment among the largely Muslim lower class at lack of protection against these attacks. Jihad The Fulani Jihad States of West Africa, c. 1830 In 1726 or 1727 Karamokho Alfa led a jihad in Futa Jallon to the south, leading to formation of the Imamate of Futa Jallon. This was followed by a jihad in Futa Toro between 1769 and 1776 led by SulaymƒÅn Baal. In 1776 the Torodbe threw out the ruling Denianke Dynasty. Sulayman died in 1776 and was succeeded by Abdul Kader ('Abd al-Qadir), a learned teacher and judge who had studied in Cayor. Abdul Kader became the first almami of the theocratic Imamate of Futa Toro. He encouraged construction of mosques, and pursued an aggressive policy towards his neighbors. The Torodbe prohibited the trade in slaves on the river. In 1785 they obtained an agreement from the French to stop trading in Muslim slaves and to pay customs duties to the state. Abdul Kader defeated the emirates of Trarza and Brakna to the north, but was defeated and captured when he attacked the Wolof states of Cayor and Waalo around 1797. After his release the jihad impetus had been lost. By the time of Abdul Kader's death in 1806 the state was dominated by a few elite Torodbe families. Government The Imamate was ruled by an Almami elected from a group of eligible lineages who possessed the necessary credentials of learning by local chiefs called jaggorde or jaggorgal. There was an electoral council, which contained a fixed core and a fluctuating periphery of members. Two families were eligible for the post of Almami, the Lih of Jaaba in Hebbiyaabe province and the Wan of Mbummba in Laaw province. Almamis continued to be appointed in Futa Toro throughout the nineteenth century, but the position had become ceremonial. The Almamate survived through the nineteenth century albeit in a much weaker state. The state was governed officially by the Almami, but effective control lay with regional chiefs of the central provinces who possessed considerable land, followers and slaves. The struggle of various coalitions of electors and eligibles further hastened the decline of the Imamate. In the middle of the nineteenth century Toro was threatened by the French under the leadership of Governor Louis Faidherbe. The Imamate at this time was divided into three parts. The Central region contained the seat of the elected Almani, subject to a council of 18 electors. The west, called the Toro region, was administered by the Lam-Toro. The east, called the Futa Damga was theoretically administered by a chief called El-Feki, but in practice he had only nominal authority. Collapse El Hadj Umar Tall, a native of Toro, launched a jihad in 1852. His forces succeeded in establishing several states in the Sudan to the east of Futa Toro, but the French under Major Louis Faidherbe prevented him from including Futa Toro into his empire. To achieve his goals, Umar recruited heavily in Senegambia, especially in his native land. The recruitment process reached its culmination in a massive drive in 1858 and 1859. It had the effect of undermining the power of the Almaami even more. The authority of the regional chiefs, and particularly that of the electors, was compromised much less than that of the Almaami. Some of these leaders became fully independent and fought off the French and Umar Tall on their own. As a result, the Almaami and the chiefs began to rely increasingly on French support. 'Umar was defeated by the French at Medine in 1857, losing access to Futa Toro. Futa Toro was annexed by France in 1859, although in practice it had long been within the French sphere of influence. In 1860 Umar concluded a treaty with the French in which he recognized their supremacy in Futa Toro, while he was recognized in Kaarta and S√©gou. In the 1860s the almami of Futa Toro was Abdul Boubakar, but his power was nominal. In June 1864 the Moors and the Booseya group of Fula collaborated in plundering trade barges that had become stranded near Sald√© in the east, drawing savage French reprisals against both groups. The French generally encouraged strongmen such as Abdul Bokar Kan of Bossea, Ibra Wan of Law and Samba Umahani in Toro when they attacked caravans in the region, since they hoped that would discourage migration away from the region to Umar's new state. Fear of continuing Muslim migration, however, led the military authorities to attack France's remaining clients in 1890. Abdul Bokar Kan fled but was murdered in August 1891 by the Berbers of Mauritania.Fage, J, D. & al. The Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 6, p. 261\\\\.

Early years  After his brother Heduohan (Êõ∑Â§öÊ±ó) was defeated and killed by the Northern Wei general Zhangsun Fei (Èï∑Â≠´ËÇ•), Shelun fled to west in 394, breaking ties with Wei. He found refuge among his uncle Yujiul√º Pihouba (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈóæÂåπÂÄôË∑ã) and cousins. However, they were unhappy about his growing power, which forced Shelun to quickly gather his supporters and capture the sons of Pihouba. Soon, Shelun killed Pihouba as well, and his sons fled to Wei. Shelun was afraid of the revenge of the empire and migrated north through the Gobi, uniting nomadic tribes on his way.  Reign  Shelun led retaliatory raids against Northern Wei, but suffered a serious defeat in 399 and was forced to flee westward. There he subjugated the Hulu (ÊñõÂæã) tribe and with an aid of a Hulu called Chiluohou (Âè±Ê¥õ‰æØ) he defeated the Gaoche, then declared himself Khagan.

It was started by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing Company to promote his radio and science magazines. It was one of the first stations to have regularly scheduled experimental television broadcast starting in August 1928. Experimenter Publishing went bankrupt in early 1929 and the station was purchased by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company to promote aviation.  Origins  Hugo Gernsback watching WRNY television as shown on the cover of the November 1928 issue of Radio News. Hugo Gernsback was born in Luxembourg and studied electrical engineering in Germany. In 1904 at age 20, Gernsback emigrated to the United States to sell his automotive battery design and to start a mail order radio and electrical components business. The Electro Importing Company catalog soon grew into a magazine, Modern Electrics. The Experimenter Publishing Company was started in 1915 and by the early 1920s was publishing Radio News, Science and Invention, and Practical Electrics magazines. Gernsback had always included fiction stories in his magazines and in 1926 launched the first magazine devoted to scientific fiction, Amazing Stories. Experimenter Publishing also published numerous technical and general interest books. KDKA in Pittsburgh was the first commercial radio station in the United States, having made its first broadcast in November 1920. By 1925 there were over 500 broadcast stations in the United States. KDKA was operated by Westinghouse Electric to help sell radio receivers. In addition to radio equipment manufacturers, many publishers were starting stations. Experimenter Publishing applied for and was granted a radio station license to transmit at 1160 kHz with the call sign WRNY. Over the next three years they would use 800 kHz, 1070 kHz, 970 kHz, 920 kHz and finally 1010 kHz. Its state of the art studio was in a hotel room on the 18th floor of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City and the 500 watt transmitter located on the hotel roof. The first broadcast was on June 12, 1925, and was covered by The New York Times. The opening speaker was former Senator Chauncey Depew followed by the \\"father of radio\\", Lee De Forest. The evening concluded with two hours of live musical entertainment. Experimenter Publishing used the radio station and the magazines to promote each other. Radio interviews with scientists or other radio notables would be reprinted in the magazines. Projects or articles from Gernsback's magazines would be discussed on WRNY. The station call letters, WRNY, appeared on each magazine cover. WRNY and 2XAL transmitter site By 1927 there were over fifty radio stations and 1.5 million radio sets in the New York metropolitan area. There were so many stations it was common for stations to share the same frequency at different times during the day. Early radio receivers were not very selective and there were frequent disputes over interference between stations with adjacent frequencies. The Radio Act of 1912 did not mention broadcasting and it was not clear who controlled radio stations, the states or the federal government. In November 1926, WRNY (800 kHz) moved its transmitter from the Roosevelt Hotel to Coytesville, New Jersey (across the Hudson River from Manhattan). Radio station WHN (830 kHz) claimed this blocked their signal and alleged WRNY was a \\"pirate\\" broadcaster. In 1927 the Federal Radio Commission was established with the authority to regulate broadcast stations. The commission formulated new frequency allocations that went into effect on June 15, 1927; WRNY and WPCH had to share time on 920 kHz. The AM band radio transmitters used around New York City at this time were typically 500 or 1000 watts. To serve a larger area, station would also have a shortwave transmitter. In 1927, WRNY started the shortwave station 2XAL (later W2XAL) at 9700 kHz. This 500 watt station could be heard for thousands of miles. In September 1928, Hugo Gernsback wrote about a listener in New South Wales, Australia.  Television  Hugo Gernsback first wrote about television in the December 1909 issue of Modern Electrics and had reported on the technical advances in his magazines. By 1925 mechanical scanning television systems were becoming available with resolutions of up to 60 scan lines. Vladimir K. Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth were developing electronic scanning systems that were the precursors of modern television but these would not be available for another decade. WRNY was the second to broadcast television pictures to the general public, after W3XK in Washington, D.C., and was preceded by several attempts to broadcast television pictures. In 1927 AT&T; had demonstrated a system that sent television images and sound over telephone lines. The General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady NY was sending experimental television over their shortwave radio station in early 1928. General Electric Television Demonstration. Westinghouse had a system that would broadcast motion pictures. Westinghouse Television Movie Demonstration on KDKA. Several other laboratories were also conducting experiments and demonstrations. Block diagram of mechanical scan television system. The television camera would use a spinning disk with a spiral of holes to sweep a narrow beam of light on the subject. The reflected light would be picked up by a photoelectric cell whose electrical output would vary with the intensity of the light. This system was often called a \\"flying spot scanner\\". The early photoelectric cells were not very sensitive, so three or four would be used with the subject in a darkened booth. Another reason for multiple cells is even pickup of reflected light from the subject. The cell array includes cells in a window formation: One or more cells above, below and on each side of the subject. The television receiver would use the output of the photoelectric cell to drive a neon lamp. When the photoelectric cell was detecting a bright spot, the neon lamp would be bright. The receiver also had a scanning disk with the same hole-pattern as the camera and it spun at the same speed. The result was a small neon orange image (two inch diagonal) of the remote subject. The Pilot \\"televisor\\" used at WRNY In April 1928, Pilot Electric Manufacturing and WRNY announced that television broadcast would begin that fall. Pilot would provide the transmitting equipment. Pilot also sold the receivers but Experimenter Publishing magazines provided complete plans that allowed readers to build their own television. The system used by WRNY had 48 scan lines with 7.5 frames per second. The image was about 1.5 inches square. This low resolution picture (without sound) could be transmitted in the 5 kHz audio bandwidth of an AM radio station. The experimental stations on the shortwave bands could use a 15 kHz bandwidth for a higher quality image. When commercial television broadcasting began in the 1940s, television stations were allotted a 6 MHz bandwidth. High definition televisions state their display resolution as 720p or 1080i; this early experimental television was a low definition 48p display. Giant photoelectric cells. Their cost was \\"rather staggering\\". The television equipment WRNY used was designed by Pilot Electric's chief engineer, John Geloso. It was similar to the system designed by Uilses A. Sanabria that was used in a demonstration on WCFL in Chicago in June 1928. Both systems used photoelectric cells made by Lloyd Preston Garner; a researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Paper on photoelectric cells by Lloyd Preston Garner A September 1928 Radio News article about these photoelectric cells noted \\"their cost is rather staggering\\". On August 12, 1928, the television equipment was moved from Pilot's Brooklyn laboratory to the WRNY transmitter house at Coytesville, NJ. A television receiver was set up a quarter of a mile away. The first subject televised was John Geloso's wife. The test ran from 5:43 PM to 6:30 with John Geloso and WRNY station engineer, John Maresca, also taking turns in front of the camera. A second test was conducted at 11 PM. The New York Times reported this successful test and said the regularly scheduled broadcast would start on August 13. Technical problems delayed this until August 21. This story said broadcast has been postponed until Friday (August 17). It turned out to be Tuesday (August 21). The receiver was moved to Hugo Gernsback's Manhattan apartment on Riverside Drive about 5 miles from the transmitter. At 10 PM on August 14, John Geloso turned on the set and viewed an image of his wife sitting before the camera in Coytesville. There were problems with synchronizing the spinning disk but a clear image could be seen for six or seven seconds at a time. The \\"Today on the radio\\" section of the August 21, 1928, edition of The New York Times showed 9 television programs on the schedule for WRNY. That night, the first public demonstration of WRNY television was held in Philosophy Hall at New York University to an audience of radio engineers, scientist and newspaper reporters. About 500 people passed before the television to see the image of Mrs. Geloso: \\"Mrs. Geloso closed her eyes, opened and closed her mouth and moved side to side. The images were about one and one-half inches square, but were magnified by a lens to twice that size.\\"  Homemade televisions  Home made television On July 4, 1928, The New York Times reported that in the past two weeks WRNY has received more than 2000 letters requesting more information about the television broadcast. Hugo Gernsback said \\"The letters have come alike from radio listeners, wireless experimenters and home set builders who wish construction details about the apparatus required to intercept the television broadcast.\\" Television on the shortwave bands could be received in New York City in early 1928 and Experimenter Publishing's magazines had been printing detailed descriptions of television receivers since 1927. The specialized parts to build a television were available that August. A New Jersey radio supply company, Daven, sold a complete television receiver kit for $100; the scanning disk was $10 and the neon bulb was $11.50. The September issue was on the newsstand on August 10, 1928. Advertisement for the Daven Corporation, Newark NJ Raytheon advertised their \\"Kino-Lamp\\" and \\"Foto-Cell\\" for engineers and amateurs building televisions. Raytheon advertisement The complexity of the television was typical of the construction projects published in Radio News every month so some experimenters had a set ready for the early August broadcast. The publication of detailed plans for the WRNY receiver in October would have increased the number of built sets. The number of home televisions in 1928 is unknown. Hugo Gernsback estimated that the New York area had around 2000 television receivers. The November 1928 issues (on the newsstand October 10) of Science and Invention and Radio News had detailed plans for building a television. The WRNY homemade television receiver consists of a modified TRF radio receiver. For WRNY, this would be an AM receiver. For other TV stations of the day, this would be a shortwave set. After the detector stage, the receiver requires a three-tube TV adapter. This adapter consists of a resistance-coupled preamplifier and a power amplifier. The power amplifier drives the neon lamp. A typical adapter has two preamplifier stages and one power amplifier stage. The adapter drives a neon lamp and a 24-inch Bakelite disk. The disk has 48 holes in a spiral pattern. The neon bulb mounts behind the disk and replaces the radio loudspeaker. To yield 7.5 image frames per second, the disk must spin at 450 rpm. A household fan motor revolves the disc. An external, variable resistor controls the motor speed. The man on the cover is adjusting scanning wheel speed with a 125-hertz tuning fork. He looks through the vibrating tuning fork at the line pattern on the hub. A stationary pattern indicates that the wheel has arrived at 450 RPM. The proper speed isn't the only requirement. The receiver disk must also match the angular position of the TV station's scanner disk. Until both disks align, the viewer presses a button that momentarily boosts the receiving disk speed. (Note: Most mechanical TV stations used scanners instead of cameras to pick up the talent.) The three vacuum tubes (V1, V2 and V3) amplified the radio output to drive the neon lamp. The variable resistors (R6 and R7) controlled the motor speed. The switch would boost the speed of the disk to synchronize it with the camera. Complete television receiver connected to an ordinary radio With homemade sets, maintaining synchronization is a major concern. A homemade receiver with a fan (\\"universal\\") motor requires the viewer to manually sync the picture. The scanner at the TV studio uses a synchronous motor. With the same type synchronous motor, the receiver is far easier to keep in step. Both the studio scanner and the home set must run off power from the same AC power grid. With synchronous motors on the same grid, receiver sync is automatic. The user must then only frame the picture. Hugo Gernsback warns potential viewers that this early television is for experimenters and \\"radio bugs.\\" He says that TV isn't for the general public. The Federal Radio Commission was concerned about television broadcast in the AM radio band and the possible interference with other broadcasts. On November 2, 1928, the FRC limited television broadcast to shortwave stations above 1500 kHz. The broadcast would be limited to a 10 kHz bandwidth and for periods of not more than one hour per day. They were not allowed between 6 PM and 11 PM. The commission would review television broadcasting in January 1929. FRC limits television in AM broadcast band. Bankruptcy By 1927 the expenses exceeded the income of the Experimenter Publishing Company. The printer and paper supplier were each owed over $150,000. The radio station had advertising revenue but it did not cover large investment in the new transmitter facility in New Jersey and the television equipment. WRNY lost $42,000 in 1927 and $39,000 in 1928. The actual amounts from the court records were $41,733.73 and $39,409.05 On February 20, 1929, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Experimenter Publishing Company. The total liabilities were estimated at $600,000 and assets at $182,000. A federal bankruptcy judge appointed the Irving Trust Company as the receiver. Irving Trust kept the magazines and radio station operating but removed Hugo Gernsback and his brother Sidney from the company. The bankruptcy was not contested and the magazines and radio stations were sold. The bankruptcy proceedings were enthusiastically covered in the news and gossip columns of the New York City press. The final bids were accepted at a hearing on April 3, 1929. Two publishers, Bernarr Macfadden and B. A. MacKinnon were the leading bidders. MacKinnon prevailed and paid $500,000 for the magazines. The radio stations were sold in a separate auction. Attorneys for newspaper publisher William R. Hearst and Curtiss Aircraft president C. M. Keys got into a bidding war for the radio stations. When the bid reached $100,000, a recess was called to allow one attorney to try to reach Hearst in California. He was unsuccessful and the Curtiss Aircraft bid won. Aviation Radio The day after the bankruptcy auction, the Aviation Radio Station, Inc. was formed to take over the WRNY radio stations. C. M. Keys, president of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, provided the financial backing for the new company. Chester Cuthell, the attorney who was at the auction, was the president and Walter Lemmon was the general manager. The goal of the station was to promote aviation. The Federal Radio Commission had to approve station license transfer and any changes to the station. Mr. Cuthell asked the commission for more frequencies as he said that he and his partners had up to $2,000,000 dollars to spend on the stations. The commission approved the license transfers and improvements to the existing stations. In August 1929 Aviation Radio moved the studios from the Roosevelt Hotel to 27 West Fifty-Seventh Street. They also installed a new 1000 watt transmitter with automatic frequency control and new speech amplifiers at their plant in Coytesville NJ. These upgrades improved the range and sound quality of their broadcast. The short wave station, 2XAL, increased its power to 15,000 watts. The radio station's format was changed; the jazz music was prohibited and replaced with presentations devoted to aviation and aviators. On a show about women aviators, Amelia Earhart recounted her recent transcontinental flight. The station gave hourly weather reports of aviators. After 1928 WRNY was at 1010 kHz and shared the frequency with 3 other stations. This was a typical broadcast schedule: WRNY started at 10:00 AM, WHN followed at 1:30 PM, WPAP followed at 7:00 PM, and finally WRNY closed out the broadcast day from 9:30 PM to midnight. WQAO, owned by the Calvary Baptist Church, broadcast three programs on Sunday and one on Wednesday. The owner of WHN, Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, bought the other stations in 1933 and WHN used 1010 kHz full-time starting in January 1934. Just prior to World War II, WHN installed a 50,000 watt directional transmitter to serve the New York metropolitan region and moved to 1050 kHz. After the war, under Loews, Inc. ownership, the station's call letters were later changed to WMGM. During the 1950s WMGM was a pioneer \\"top 40\\" personality station, but struggled in the early 1960s as it faced competition for the hit music audience from WMCA and eventual market leader WABC (AM). It changed back to WHN in the 1960s under middle-of-the-road and later country formats, and in the 1990s became progressive talk station WEVD. The station was acquired in recent years by the Disney organization, which has made it the flagship of the all-sports ESPN radio network under the current callsign WEPN.

A radio station's antenna was a one-half wavelength long wire between two masts. The unit kilocycle (kc.) was replaced by kilohertz (kHz) in the 1960s.

It is considered one of the primary sources of the Zahirite or literalist school within Sunni Islam. Description Kitab al-MuhallƒÅ bi'l AthƒÅr is, according to Ibn Hazm himself, is a commentary of a more extensive work. This book, which is now lost, was called al-MujallƒÅ. The book is noted for the author's view that a Muslim is not obliged to fulfill every promise; specifically, that a Muslim who promised to commit a criminal act shouldn't fulfill such a promise.Azizah Y. Al-Hibri, \\"The Nature of Islamic Marriage.\\" Taken from Covenant Marriage In Comparative Perspective, pg. 192. Eds. John Witte, Jr. and Eliza Ellison. Religion, marriage, and family series. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2005. Reception It is his commentary on his own al-MujallƒÅ (\\"The Brilliant Treatise\\"), and it is considered a masterpiece of fiqh literature. A site describes it: :This book is a wealth of scholarship, in which Ibn Hazm discusses each question separately. On each question, he cites the views of earlier scholars of high achievement, not restricting himself to the views of the four schools of Fiqh, but also citing the rulings of scholars like al-Hassan al-Basri (d. 110), al- Laith ibn Saad (d. 175), Ata' (d. 114), Sufyan al-Thawri (d. 161), al-Awza'ie (d. 157), etc. He also quotes the evidence they cite in support of their views. He then discusses why he considers their views incorrect, and produces the evidence in support of his own view. This makes for a highly scholarly discussion. Many scholars describe Al-Muhalla as the encyclopaedia of Islamic Fiqh. Indeed, it has preserved many of the views of early scholars whose work was either not documented or lost. The only problem with Al-Muhalla is that Ibn Hazm is often scathing in his criticism of his opponents. Yet there is no doubt that he is an honest defender of what he considers to be the truth. Any scholar who wants to exercise ijtihad, in order to arrive at rulings for questions encountered in present day life cannot overlook Al-Muhalla. Muhalla has been a significant work for proponents of the Zahirite school of law. During the Almohad Caliphate in particular, learning it was standard for the training of the judiciary. During the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, the Zahiri Revolt was inspired in part by active studying and teaching of the book, in addition to separate political grievances.Carl Brockelmann, Geschichte der Arabschen Litteratur. Zweite den Supplementbanden ange-passte Auflage. Vol. 1, pg. 400. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1937‚Äì1949. In the modern era, this trend has continued with adherents of the school; Pakistani scholar Badi' ud-Din Shah al-Rashidi, for example, gave classes based on the book in Masjid al-Haram, Islam's holiest site, in Mecca.Abdullaah Nasir Rehmaani, \\"A Biography of Shaykh Badee-ud-Deen Shah Rashidee as-Sindhee.\\" Trns. Abu Naasir and Abu Handhala. Prepared by al-Meezaan.com. Similarly, Yemeni scholar Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi'i taught the book in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Islam's second holiest site, while in Medina. Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri, a biographer of Ibn Hazm, sought permission to teach the book in Riyadh, though the predominantly Hanbalite religious establishment did't grant approval. The Ahl al-Hadith movement in India and Pakistan frequently use the book as a teaching tool as well. Ibn Abd al-Salam said: \\"I did not see, in all the books of knowledge in Islam, anything like Ibn Hazm's al-Muhalla nor like Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Din's Ibn Qudama al-Mughni.\\" Al-Dhahabi comments: \\"Shaykh \`Izz al- Din is right, and the third is Al-Bayhaqi's al-Sunan al-Kubra, and the fourth Ibn 'Abd al-Barr's al-Tamhid. Whoever obtains these volumes, if he is one of the intelligent muftis and perseveres in reading them - he is truly a \`alim. Muhammad Abu Zahra, one of the leading scholars in the twentieth century, describes this book in these words: \\"It is truly and accurately the pillar of Islamic Fiqh, and it is a highly useful book. Had it not been for the usage of scathing remarks and some phrases that are evidently inappropriate and out of place, it would have been the best book ever on Sunni Fiqh.

Marriage to Northern Yan princess  There is historical indication that Yujiul√º Hul√º (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠ÊñõÂæã) began his rule in May 410 and, the following year, offered a tribute of three thousand horses to the Northern Yan ruler Feng Ba, Original from the University of California with a request to marry Feng Ba's daughter, Princess Lelang (Ê®ÇÊµ™ÂÖ¨‰∏ª), who was probably the daughter of Feng Ba's wife, Princess Sun. Feng Ba's brother, Feng Sufu, suggested refusing the request and sending the daughter of one of Feng Ba's concubines instead, but Feng Ba was apparently convinced that an alliance with Rouran would be beneficial to his state, and agreed to give Princess Lelang in marriage to Yujiul√º Hul√º in 411.  Deposition and exile  In 414, the fourth year of his rule, as he was, in turn, about to oversee the marriage of one of his own daughters to Feng Ba, he was confronted by his nephew Yujiul√º Buluzhen (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Ê≠•ÈπøÁúü) who told him that his daughter was still small and was about travel far away; as she may get sick with longing, it would be necessary to send the daughters of the nobleman, such as Shuli (Ê®πÈªé) and Wudeyan (ÂãøÂú∞Âª∂) with her. Hul√º not agreeing with him, Buluzhen told Shuli and others that Hul√º was thinking of giving their daughters as a dowry for his daughter to a distant, alien state. In the wake of news Shuli, among other noblemen, entered into a conspiracy with Buluzhen. Some warriors were set up behind the Hul√º's yurts at night and arrested him with his daughter. As result, Yujiul√º Buluzhen was set up as khagan, with Shuli (Ê†ëÈªé) as chancellor.Book of Wei, vol. 103 Meanwhile Buluzhen sent Yujiul√º Hul√º and his daughter to Northern Yan. Feng Ba treated him as an honored guest and, as originally planned, took Yujiul√º's daughter as a concubine. Yujiul√º Hul√º requested that Feng Ba send an army to escort him home and, in May 414, Feng Ba, with some reluctance, gave him an escort commanded by general Wan Ling (Ëê¨Èôµ) who, according to the account, returned after having killed Yujiul√º Hul√º along the way.

Joan Rosanove was born in Ballarat, Australia. Her father Mark Aaron Lazarus was a barrister and solicitor; both her parents were non-practicing Jews.Falk, B. Rosanove, Joan Mavis (1896‚Äì1974), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp 125‚Äì126. She attended the Loreto convent school and Clarendon Ladies' College; she was articled to her father in 1917 and began to attend the University of Melbourne to study law. She was formally admitted to practice as a barrister and solicitor on 2 June 1919. In 1920 she married Emmanuel ('Mannie') Rosanove, a dermatologist, and they had two daughters. In 1923 the family moved to Melbourne, and in September that year she was the first woman in Victoria to sign the Victorian Bar roll. She could not obtain room in the Selborne Chambers, but established a successful practice nonetheless, acting mainly in criminal and divorce cases. In November 1934 Rosanove represented Egon Kisch in Melbourne when he defied his immigration exclusion order and leapt five meters on to the deck of Station Pier breaking his right leg. The Rosanoves travelled to Canada, the United States of America and Britain in between 1932 and 1933. When they returned to Melbourne they lived at Toorak. In 1949 Joan again signed the Bar roll and achieved her ambition to practise from Selborne Chambers by accepting a position as 'reader' to a male barrister Edward Ellis. She took over his room when he moved to Western Australia. From 1954 Rosanove submitted a number of applications in Victoria to be made a Q.C. That she had to wait until 16 November 1965 to be appointed led many of her peers to conclude that 'she had been shabbily treated'. In 1967 she took her struggle for the rights of women lawyers to New South Wales. Her biography Woman in a wig,: Joan Rosanove, QC written by Isabel Ray Carter, was published in 1970. In 1999 the Victorian Bar named their Melbourne offices the Joan Rosanove Chambers in her honour.

It is akin to the autopista, the other major highway class, but has fewer features and is never a toll road. Some distinguishing features of an autov√≠a are that it must be divided by a median, it must have restricted access, and it cannot be crossed by other roads. While autopistas are generally new routes, autov√≠as are normally improvements to existing roads, so they may have tighter curves and less safe accesses, often with shorter acceleration lanes. However, both have nominal speed limits of . Rest areas are usually or 2 hours apart. There is usually a safety lane along the median. Although generally state-owned and financed, there are some autov√≠as which are actually built and maintained by private companies, such as Pamplona-Logro√±o A-12.Navarra.es Navarran Autonomous Community news bulletin, February 5 2007 The company assumes the building costs and the Autonomous Community where they are located (in the given example, Navarre) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics. This fee is called a shadow toll ().Capital Madrid, March 30, 2007 The system can be regarded as a way for the Government to finance the construction of new roads without any initial outlay of money. Also, since payment starts after the road is finished, there are fewer construction delays in comparison with regular state-owned construction. Restricted Access Most autov√≠as are restricted to car, motorcycle, and lorry use only. Restricted forms of transport include the horse, mopeds and tractors. Because autov√≠as often exist as an improvement to an existing road, users of these restricted forms of transport may often find themselves having to take long diversions in order to reach their intended destination. It is very rare that alternative routes will be provided for these users. Bicycles may travel on the shoulders of some autov√≠as, but not autopistas. Other uses Autov√≠a was also the name of a 2 car DMU train of the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico that operated between Ciudad Ju√°rez and Chihuahua, Mexico.

Life  He was a son of Yujiul√º Puhun (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠ÂÉïÊµë), thus a cousin of Yujiul√º Hul√º who in 414 was overthrown by his nephew Yujiul√º Buluzhen. Later Buluzhen became involved in a love affair with a younger wife of Gaoche leader Chiluohou (Âè±Ê¥õ‰æØ). Chiluohou was an early supporter of Shelun who entrusted him with his son Sheba (Á§æÊãî) . The younger wife revealed to Buluzhen that Chiluohou would support Datan against Buluzhen, as a sign of fidelity, sent him a golden rein. As a response, Buluzhen sent 8,000 cavalry against Chiluohou and burned all his properties while Chiluohou committed suicide. After this, Buluzhen attacked Datan hastily, however Datan came out victorious and strangled both Sheba and Buluzhen, eliminating both rivals and then declared himself khagan.  Reign  He immediately allied himself to Feng Ba upon gaining throne and warred against Northern Wei. Datan led the troops to raid the border in winter of 415, but Emperor Mingyuan met him with the army. The Datan began to retreat but Wei general Daxi Jin (ÈÅîÂ•öÊñ§) rushed after him. His forces ran into severe weather and suffered many casualties based on frostbite. This would start a theme that would last for centuries‚Äîoften, Rouran would attack, and Northern Wei would counter-attack successfully, but then become unable to have decisive victories over Rouran. Meanwhile Datan reinforced relations with Northern Yan, sent a tribute of 3,000 horses and 10,000 sheep in 417. In 423, almost immediately after Emperor Taiwu took the throne, Datan attacked Northern Wei with about 60000 soldiers. Emperor Taiwu engaged Rouran troops, and on the very first engagement became surrounded by Rouran troops, but he fought his way out of danger, and subsequently, he made nearly yearly attacks against Rouran, and each year, Rouran forces would elude him by retreating north, only to return south after he withdrew. He was planning another invasion of Wei in 427, but destruction of Xia and capture of Helian Chang, forced him to reconsider and back down. Yet another raid was made by Rouran in 428 with 10.000 cavalry. In 429, at the advice of Cui Hao, and against the advice of all other officials and his wet nurse Nurse Empress Dowager Dou, Emperor Taiwu attacked Rouran. Cui believed that further major conflicts with Liu Song were inevitable, and that Northern Wei must first deal Rouran a major defeat to avoid being attacked on both sides. However, Cui did not accompany Emperor Taiwu on this campaign, although he did inform Kou Qianzhi, another Wei official, who was, that the main Rouran force must be found and destroyed. When Emperor Taiwu engaged Rouran and dealt it a major loss, but was unable to find its Datan, he did not want to advance any further in fear of a trap, and even when Kou informed him what Cui had said, he stopped the pursuit. Only later did he find out that he was actually close to Yujiul√º Datan's position and could have easily found and destroyed Yujiul√º Datan, and he regretted this greatly. Datan on the other hand died from an illness on his way and was succeeded in 429 by Yujiul√º Wuti.  Family  He had at least 4 sons and a daughter: * Yujiul√º Wuti * Yujiul√º Tulugui (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠ÁßÉÈπøÂÇÄ) * Yujiul√º Qiliegui (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠‰πûÂàóÂΩí) * Yujiul√º Qilifu (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠‰øüÂäõÂºó) - ancestor of Yujiul√º Furen (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈóæ‰ºè‰ªÅ, d. 29 November 586), a Sui dynasty official * Yujiul√º Zuozhaoyi (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Â∑¶Êò≠‰ª™) - married to Emperor Taiwu, became mother of Tuoba Yu He also had several younger brothers named TƒÅwu W√∫luh√∫ (‰ªñÂêæÊó†ÈπøËÉ°), Yuedai (ÊÇÖ‰ª£), Pili (ÂåπÈªé), Yujiul√º F√®ng (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠ÈóæÂá§), Yujiul√º Dafei (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Â§ßËÇ•), Yujiul√º Danibeiyi (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Â§ßÂüøÂÄçÈ¢ê) and Yujiul√º Lin (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠È©é).

It is situated on the north bank of the River Tyne, facing Jarrow, and between Wallsend and North Shields. It is served by the Howdon Metro station in Howdon. The area from 2006 onwards has been an area of new housing built on brownfield sites. The house building continues into 2013 and is changing the social and economic balance in the area. The area has also had a make over of the bowling green off Howdon Lane and further warehousing next to the bowling green has been demolished to make way for further new housing. The changes made recently at Willington Quay are now making it an attractive place to live within North Tyneside. Local government The area, originally in the parish of Wallsend, became an urban sanitary district in the late 19th century. The Local Government Act 1894 brought together the Howdon and Willington Quay USDs as an urban district of Northumberland. In 1910, the urban district became part of the borough of Wallsend.  History   Industry  The Tyne Iron Shipyard was founded in 1876 in the village. It suffered a major fire in 1920, which resulted in several workshops being destroyed and ships being damaged. The yard was acquired by Armstrong Whitworth in 1928 after the original company went into liquidation. The following year, it completed construction of the cargo ship Kitty Taylor. The company sold the yard in 1933. Eltringham's ship yard, the site of which was bought in 1912, was formerly on the banks of the River Tyne in the village. The yard was later the site of a plywood factory. Cookson's lead works was another company once operating in the village. Addison, Potter and Son, a cement-making company, was acquired by the British Portland Cement Manufacturing Company in 1912. The steel wire and rope manufacturers Messrs. R. Hood Haggie and Son, founded in 1789, was also situated in Willington Quay. As of 2016, the site is still used for rope manufacture, by Bridon.  Culture  In 1936, Irene Ward MP wrote to The Times to ask if readers would consider donating musical instruments to the unemployed of the village. One member of the community had apparently made his own violin. The same year, a Daily Mail article recorded that young people were having to leave the area in order to find work.  Transport  The village's railway station closed in 1973.  Health  Willington Quay Maternity Hospital was a 14 bed facility constructed in 1926, the first to be built by Northumberland County Council. It closed during the 1970s and was demolished by 1995.  Religion  A United Presbyterian church was built in 1867, with a 92 foot spire. St Paul's, a Church of England chapel, in the benefice of the Willington Team Parish, the deanery of Tynemouth and the Diocese of Newcastle, was reordered to provide a base for St Paul's Community Partnership in the late 2000s.

The Arellano-F√©lix Organization, also known as the Tijuana Cartel, has been responsible for countless murders and the smuggling of thousands of tons of marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine for more than a decade. The DEA believes that the Arellano-F√©lix brothers were responsible for the numerous smuggling tunnels that were found in January 2006. Arellano is believed to be one of the most sophisticated brothers and had taken control of the cartel, called the Tijuana Cartel or \\"Arellano F√©lix Organization\\". He was wanted by Mexican and United States authorities in connection with the smuggling of several tons of marijuana and cocaine from Mexico into the U.S. each year. He and his sister Enedina Arellano F√©lix became the leaders of the drug cartel after their brother Javier Arellano F√©lix was arrested by U.S. authorities in Baja California on August 16, 2006. His brother Ram√≥n Arellano F√©lix, believed to be the most ruthless member, was eventually killed in a Mazatl√°n shootout with the Federal Police in February 2002. His other brother Benjam√≠n Arellano F√©lix, \\"the mastermind\\", was arrested in March 2002. Kingpin Act sanction On 1 June 2004, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Arellano F√©lix under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with nine other international criminals and two entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.  Arrest  Arellano was captured by the Mexican Federal Police after a shootout in Tijuana, Baja California, on October 26, 2008. Eduardo was sought by Interpol in 180 countries, and the U.S. State Department had been offering USD$5,000,000 for information leading to his arrest. Eduardo Arellano F√©lix was charged in the U.S. Southern District of California with conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana. Authorities say Arellano did not go down without a fight, despite having his 11-year-old daughter near him. On the same day, the Mexican military also arrested other alleged lieutenant of the Tijuana Cartel in a separate incident: Luis Ramirez V√°zquez, known as El G√ºero Camar√≥n, or The Blond Shrimp. Although the arrests were blows to the Arellano F√©lix cartel it did not dismantle the organization, which is now being led by Eduardo's nephew, Luis Fernando S√°nchez Arellano.Luis Ramirez Vazquez Extradition and sentence On September 1, 2012, he was extradited to the U.S. to face charges of money laundering and drug trafficking among other crimes. He is the last Arellano F√©lix brother named in a 2003 indictment to be extradited. On August 18, 2013, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. His sentence, however, was shorter than the one his brothers received because the U.S. court deemed that he was \\"less involved in the unsavory aspects\\" on the Tijuana Cartel. U.S. District Judge Larry A. Burns reminded Arellano that he was convicted either way because he was well-aware of the violent doings of his criminal organization, and told him that he should be embarrassed of his actions because they had a negative effect on the community and on the relationship between Mexico and the U.S. When he completes his sentence in the U.S., Arellano will be deported back to Mexico. He is serving his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook.

The scheduled flight was from Kansas City to Los Angeles, with a stopover in Wichita.Although many recent sources refer to this as \\"Flight 599\\" (for example, page 35 of College Football's Great Dynasties: Notre Dame by Roland Lazenby, published in 1991), this seems to be a corruption; older sources, along with other recent sources, refer to it as \\"Flight 5\\" (an older example is page 127 of The Only Way to Fly: the Story of Western Airlines, America's Senior Air Carrier by Robert J. Serling, published in 1976). Transcontinental & Western Air's own timetables from this period have no \\"Flight 599\\" or any flight numbers with more than two digits, and its transcontinental flights all have one-digit numbers, as can be seen in Airline Timetable Images' scans of T&WA;'s February 1, 1931 and April 20, 1931 timetables. The latter timetable includes a \\"Flight No. 5\\" with the same route and schedule as the flight which crashed. On this first leg, the wooden structure of one wing failed, causing the plane to crash, killing all eight people on board, including legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne. The investigation found that the wooden wing became moist over time, causing the glue connecting the wing to the body to weaken, allowing the wing to separate. The crash brought about significant changes in airplane safety, the airplane industry, and was of cultural significance, due to the death of Rockne and the public perception of the safety of aircraft.Sumwalt, Robert L. (former Chairman, NTSB), \\"Remarks To The Chief Aircraft Accident Investigators Programme Of Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore And Singapore Aviation Academy, Singapore, Republic Of Singapore,\\", August 22, 2007, as transcribed at National Transportation Safety Board, retrieved April 10, 2019 The crash The Transcontinental and Western Air flight was a Fokker F.10 Trimotor en route from Kansas City to Los Angeles on March 31, 1931. On the first leg of the flight to Wichita, the airplane crashed into an open fieldcrash site satellite-sightseer.com a few miles southwest of Bazaar; all eight on board died, including famed football coach Knute Rockne, of the University of Notre Dame. Questions have been raised about the exact sequence of events in the crash, and eyewitness accounts raise further questions about the exact sequence of events and the associated technical analysis. Numerous factors complicated the subsequent investigation, resulting in difficulty establishing, with certainty, the cause of the crash. The investigation was initially undermined by a severe shortage of evidence: When government investigators first arrived at the crash site, they found that most of the wreckage had been taken by souvenir hunters and scavengers, leaving only engines, wings and propeller. Among the issues speculated is that the craft may have been dealing with turbulence, or icing on the aircraft, or both‚Äîwhich could have resulted in flying conditions that may have led to control difficulty, and an overstressing of the wing. (As evidence, some cite the co- pilot's radio call to Wichita, an hour into the flight, saying, \\"The weather here is getting tough. We're going to turn around and go back to Kansas City.\\") Later theories conclude that the pilots thought their difficulty controlling the plane was due to clear-air turbulence, and the transmission was sent before they were aware of the wing's deficiency, if indeed they ever knew before the wing failed. It is often claimed that the flight went down in or shortly after a thunderstorm, but meteorological records show that there was no significant convective activity at the time. The late morning accident was arguably caused by the composition of the aircraft. The wings of Fokker Trimotors were manufactured out of wood laminate; in this instance, moisture had leaked into the interior of one wing over a period and had weakened the glue bonding the structure. One spar finally failed; the wing developed uncontrolled flutter and separated from the aircraft. In any case, the structural condition of the wooden wing is widely agreed to have been at least a significant contributory factor. Public impact and aviation legacy Although the accident is best known for causing the death of Rockne, it also led to major changes in American aviation that radically transformed airline safety worldwide. Other comparable crashes had occurred before, but this one, which killed a popular national hero, brought a national outcry for getting \\"answers to the mystery\\" as the public demanded solutions that might prevent such disasters in the future. Rockne mourned and questions raised The most notable person aboard was Knute Rockne, head football coach at the University of Notre Dame and a national hero. Revered as more than simply the football coach with the most wins to his credit of all time, Rockne‚Äîfamed for coaching his players towards both victory and morality‚Äîwas a beloved figure at the start of the Great Depression. Despite his Norwegian immigrant origins, he was regarded as the \\"All-American\\" icon of virtuous strength and honorable success. Rockne, 43, was on his way to Los Angeles to participate in the production of the Hollywood motion picture The Spirit of Notre Dame (released October 13, 1931). A father of four, Rockne had stopped over in Kansas City to visit his two eldest children, sons Bill and Knute, Jr., in boarding school there at Pembroke Hill.The Official Knute Rockne Web Site . URL accessed 03:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC) The sudden, dramatic death of Rockne startled the nation, and triggered a national outpouring of grief, comparable to the deaths of presidents. President Herbert Hoover called Rockne's death \\"a national loss.\\"Hoover, Herbert, President of the United States, message to Mrs. Knute Rockne, 119 - \\"Message of Sympathy on the Death of Knute Rockne\\", April 1, 1931, Washington, D.C., cited on the web site of The American Presidency Project King Haakon VII of Norway (Rockne's birthplace) posthumously knighted him and sent a personal envoy to the massive funeral, held at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on the Notre Dame campus.

All Fokker Trimotors in U.S. airline service were temporarily grounded, and they were henceforth required to undergo more frequent and rigorous inspections and maintenance. The expense of this, compounded with the bad publicity associated with Rockne's death, almost sank TWA, while aircraft manufacturer Fokker suffered a serious blow to its reputation and sales. The intense public interest in the cause of the accident forced the Department of Commerce to abandon its policy of keeping the results of aircraft accident investigations secret. Many references claim that the accident was also the impetus for the formation of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), an independent investigative organization and the predecessor of the National Transportation Safety Board, but the CAB was not formed until 1940, five years after an accident involving US Senator Bronson M. Cutting underlined the department's conflicts of interest with respect to their associations with airlines and their provision and maintenance of navigational aids.

Aircraft design and technology The disaster discredited wood-framed aircraft, and it effectively forced airlines to adopt all-metal aircraft. The result was a leap forward in aircraft design quality and safety, as manufacturers developed advanced all-metal designs under pressure from the airlines. Various aircraft safety innovations were proposed and promoted, largely in response to the crash. Overall, the success and/or development of three key aircraft in aviation history were driven largely by the Rockne crash: * Ford Trimotor :Airlines first turned to the all-metal Ford Trimotor‚Äîa slow, boxy three- engined aircraft similar to the Fokker but all-metal and already available and in use at the time. Though slower than the Fokker and far more costly to build, the Ford offered sturdy all-metal construction and (in some cases) greater capacity.Bryan, C.D.B, The National Air and Space Museum, 5th printing, the Smithsonian Institution‚ÄîNational Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC / Harry N. Abrams, Inc., NY - 1985/1979Schatzberg, Eric, (b.1956) Wings of wood, wings of metal : culture and technical choice in American airplane materials, 1914-1945, (c1999), Chapter 5: \\"Metal and commercial aviation i: Henry Ford takes flight,\\" pp.96-113, on the History of Science and Technology website of the University of Wisconsin, USA * Boeing 247 :Boeing developed the first truly modern airliner, the Boeing 247, which ushered in key design features now common in most airliners: Mansfield, Harold, VISION: The Story of Boeing, Popular Library, NY, 1966 Redding, Robert and Bill Yenne, \\"The Flying Pullmans\\" in Boeing: Planemaker to the World, Bison/Crescent/Crown, Greenwich, Connecticut, USA, 1983 :*hollow-shell (\\"monocoque\\") all-metal design (aluminum), for light and streamlined aircraft structure, :*retractable landing gear (significant streamlining, and greater speed/efficiency), :*NACA engine cowling (significant streamlining, and greater speed/efficiency), :*supercharged engines, forcing pressurized air into the engines thereby increasing power, and enabling operation in thinner air at higher altitudes, above some weather, :*sufficient reserve engine power to allow safe takeoff with a full load on only one engine (of multiple engines), in the event of an engine failure at takeoff (time of highest likelihood for engine failure), :*controllable-pitch propellers (like a continuously-variable transmission on an automobile, allowing a wider range of flying speeds, more thrust for takeoff, and more efficient propulsion, improving performance), on later models, starting with 247D, and :*de-icing equipment. * Douglas DC-2/Douglas DC-3: :The Boeing 247 would soon be utterly eclipsed by another plane designed in response to the Rockne crash, the Douglas DC-2/Douglas DC-3. The most important commercial aircraft of all time, the Douglas DC-3 was developed initially as the Douglas DC-1/Douglas DC-2 to fill TWA's demand for an all-metal replacement for their suddenly-obsolete trimotor aircraft. :United Airlines (under United Aircraft, which was also the parent company of Boeing, at the time) had monopolized all Boeing 247 production, forcing TWA to look elsewhere to modernize their fleet from the wooden Fokkers and clunky Fords; the Douglas DC-2 was the result.Allen, Frederick, \\"The Letter that Changed the Way We Fly\\", American Heritage of Invention & Technology, Fall 1998, with photos of the post-Rockne-crash letter from TWA president Jack Frye seeking a newer airliner (the letter that would trigger development of the DC-3). The DC-2 took all the advances of the Boeing 247 a step further with greater speed, range, and payload which evolved with the rounding of its fuselage into the wider 21-seat DC-3, which became the first airliner to truly make airlines profitable. The DC-3 revolutionized the affordability, availability and safety of air travel ‚Äî triggering an \\"explosion\\" in airline travel to seven times the volume within a few years of the Rockne crash. Most of the world's air travel was in DC-3s by the start of World War II (in which the DC-3 became the most successful military transport). The DC-3 launched regional airlines in the postwar years, and it remained a powerful force in spreading aviation's benefit for the rest of the century, with some still flying today. Airline safety revolution With these superior, safer aircraft matched to greatly increased and more public government inspection and regulation of aviation, crash rates plummeted to a tiny fraction of those of the wooden airliner years. Today, the legacy of the crash is simply that the most dangerous way to travel in 1931‚Äîairlines‚Äîradically transformed into what has now become the safest way to travel. Memorials and commemorations The Knute Rockne Memorialmemorial at the crash site near Bazaar, Kansas, memorializes Rockne and the 7 others who died with him. The tall, engraved-granite marker,marker a memorial dedicated to the victims and topped with the name \\"Rockne\\", stands surrounded by a wire fence with wooden posts; it was maintained for many years by James Easter Heathman, who died in 2008, who, at age 13 in 1931, was one of the first people to arrive at the site of the crash. Former Knute Rockne memorial on the Kansas Turnpike Now part of the Heathman family estate, the memorial and crash site are on private property, off-road, and accessible only by arrangementarrangement with the landowners, or during memorial commemorations. A memorial ceremony is held at the crash site memorial (and at a nearby schoolhouse) every five years since the crash, drawing relatives of the victims, and Rockne / Notre Dame fans, from around the world. In 2011, on the 80th anniversary of the crash, over 150 people gathered, including former Football Hall of Fame director Bernie Kish. Speeches were made, a bagpipe played, and a small plane flew over the crowd at the crash site, on the exact minute of the crash. The Matfield Green rest stop and travel plaza on the Kansas Turnpike near Bazaar and the crash site used to have a large, glassed- in exhibit on the west side of its center foyer commemorating Rockne (chiefly), as well as the other crash victims, and the crash. The passengers and crew of the flight were K. Rockne, H. J. Christansen (Chicago), J. H. Hooper (Chicago), W. B. Miller (Hartford, Conn.), F. Goldthwaite (New York), C. A. Lobrech (Chicago), Pilot Robert Fry, and Co-Pilot Jess Mathias.

Hammond High Magnet School,School web site (accessed 2012-03-12). founded in 1866, is a public high school located in an unincorporated part of the 7th Ward of Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, United States, east of Hammond. It is the second-largest high school in the Tangipahoa Parish Public School System. Until the end of academic year 2010-11 it was known as Hammond High School but became Hammond Magnet High School on being so reconstituted and designated by the Tangipahoa Parish School System. The mascot is the Tornado, and the school colors are purple and white. As of the 2019-2020 school year, Hammond High's principal is Shelly Gaydos. The school enrolls students from Hammond and the surrounding area within Tangipahoa Parish because of the presence of the Magnet program and International Baccalaureate program. Hammond's chief rival is the Ponchatoula Green Wave. History Originally located between East Thomas Street (US 190, then a two-way road) and Morris Street (the building became Eastside Elementary School and later the Eastside Apartments), the school moved to a location on the south side of West Morris Street (US 190, now eastbound only) shortly after World War I; the West Morris Street site is now the world headquarters of Neill Corporation. In the Morris Street location, although the vernacular name was Hammond High School, officially it was \\"Annie Eastman High School\\" in commemoration of a former teacher. In the late 1960s the school relocated to a site north of University Avenue (LA 3234)‚Äînow the North Campus of Southeastern Louisiana University. From there Hammond High moved to its current location on LA 1064 (River Road). Linus A. Sims (1882-1949) was appointed the principal of Hammond High School in 1923. Two years later, he started Hammond Junior College in a wing of the high school, then on the south side of West Morris Street. In 1928, the junior college, under Sims's leadership, became the future Southeastern Louisiana University (then College).

In the West he might be best known for manga-related works and the story The Sunset, 2217 A.D. which appeared in Frederik Pohl's \\"Best Science Fiction for 1972\\".  Biography   Birth and Age of student  Mitsuse was born at Minami-Senju, Kita-Toshima District, Tokyo Prefecture in 1928. His birth name was Kimio Chiba (). The eldest son of Kiz≈ç Chiba and Kiyo. There were three elder sisters.Yume wo nomi pp. 594-606 In around June, 1945, he evacuated to Iwate prefecture, which was his parents' homeland, from Tokyo. He transferred to ky≈´sei Ichinose middle school.Ichinose pre-World War‚Ö° middle school (). Now Iwate prefecrure Ichinose Dai-ichi K≈çt≈çgakk≈ç ( JA) In 1948, he graduated from this middle school and entered the Toyo University in Tokyo. But he dropped out, and entered the Meiji University. But he again dropped out in short period. He transferred to Kawamura high school and graduated from this school. In 1949, Mitsuse entered the department of Agriculture of the Tokyo University of Education. In 1950, he transferred to the department of Science, zoology course, and graduated from this university in 1953. In 1954, Mitsuse again entered the department of literature, philosophy course, in Tokyo University of Education, which he did not graduate from. During this period in Tokyo, he was engaging in literary coterie activities.

He was the son of Yujiul√º Datan.  Reign  In 432, Northern Wei captured 20 Rouran warriors at the border, but Emperor Taiwu pardoned them. Impressed Wuti sent him tributes for this. Later in 435, Wuti was married to Princess Xihai (Ë•øÊµ∑ÂÖ¨‰∏ª) a cousin or sister of Emperor Taiwu and gave his sister as a concubine of Taiwu. She was accompanied by brother Wuti's brother Yujiul√º Tulugui (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠ÁßÉÈπøÂÇÄ) who presented the emperor 2,000 horses. In 436‚Äì437, Wuti unexpectedly violated the peace and attacked the border. Taiwu responded by declaring war on the Rouran. But the campaign ended soon since Wei had no more provisions, and they did not seize the Rouran cattles. He was involved in Wei war against Northern Liang in 439. Situation was a result of the Northern Wei messengers to the Xiyu kingdoms, who were going through Northern Liang frequently, were alleging that Juqu Mujian had informed Xiyu kingdoms that they should not submit to Northern Wei and should submit to Rouran instead. At the encouragement of the prime minister Cui Hao, Emperor Taiwu again prepared military action. With Yuan He, the son of Southern Liang's last prince Tufa Rutan, as guide, he launched a speedy attack and arrived at Guzang quickly. Juqu Mujian, in shock, refused to surrender, defending the city against a siege, while seeking immediate military assistance from Wuti. Yujiul√º Wuti did launch a surprise attack on Pingcheng to try to force Emperor Taiwu to give up the campaign, but after initial successes, he failed to capture Pingcheng, and his brother Yujiul√º Qiliegui (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠‰πûÂàóÊ≠∏) was captured by Northern Wei forces. About 10000 Rouran soldiers were slaughtered. In fall 443, while attacking Rouran, Emperor Taiwu suddenly encountered Wuti, and Crown Prince Huang, who was with him, advised an immediate attack, but Emperor Taiwu hesitated, allowing Wuti to escape. In 444, Taiwu began a new attack to Rouran. Wuti was defeated and fled. He later died and was succeeded by Yujiul√º Tuhezhen.

He was often referred to by his nickname \\"Hanna\\". Widely regarded as one of the country's finest rock guitarists, he was best known for his long collaboration with singer- songwriter Ross Wilson, which began as teenagers, with The Pink Finks and forming the seminal early '70s Australian rock band Daddy Cool. Hannaford died of cancer after being diagnosed a year earlier. The Pink Finks Ross Andrew Hannaford was born in Newcastle on 1 December 1950, his family moved to Melbourne one year later. Hannaford and Wilson first teamed up in the hometown of Melbourne in early 1965, in the R&B; band The Pink Finks, which enjoyed moderate local success. This was followed by the more progressively-oriented The Party Machine, They released a single \\"You've All Gotta Go\\" in 1969; their printed songbooks were confiscated and burned by the Victorian Vice Squad for being obscene and seditious. The Party Machine disbanded in 1969, with Wilson travelling to London. Sons of the Vegetal Mother After a short stint in the UK, Wilson returned to Australia and reunited with Hannaford ca. 1970 in the even more avant garde Sons of the Vegetal Mother, which embodied Wilson's enthusiasm for the music of Frank Zappa. Daddy Cool This band eventually evolved into Daddy Cool, which had started out as an informal offshoot of the Vegetals but soon overtook it. After the release of their hugely successful debut single \\"Eagle Rock\\" and their debut LP Daddy Who? Daddy Cool, the band became one of the most popular and successful rock acts of the decade, breaking all previous sales records for an Australian act. Hannaford's unique guitar stylings won wide praise from critics and his goofy stage presence, distinctive baritone voice and trademark 'helicopter' cap made him a favourite with fans. He also wrote several of the group's songs and co-designed the sleeve of their second album, Sex, Dope, Rock'n'Roll: Teenage Heaven. Mighty Kong After the first split of Daddy Cool at the end of 1972, Wilson and Hannaford formed the short-lived Mighty Kong with former members of Spectrum and Company Caine and they recorded one album, All I Wanna Do Is Rock, but they split just after the record was released. Relax with Max  Ross Hannaford along with other great musicians such as Gary Young, Greg Ham, Toots \\"Linda\\", James Black and David Adam, played with Max Vella in \\"Relax with Max\\" in the late 1980s.  Busking  Hannaford was regularly seen in Melbourne, to the delight of passers by, busking. Many onlookers would admire his performance and guitar playing opening up his music to a whole new audience. Reunions  Daddy Cool reformed in 1974 and continued until 1976, when they split again. Hannaford and Wilson's last collaboration in this period was on the soundtrack for the 1976 movie Oz. Hannaford subsequently did a considerable amount of session work and played in many bands. His group and recording credits include The Black Sorrows, Paul Madigan & The Humans, Ian Moss, Steve Hoy, Mark Gillespie, Billy T, Ram Band, Goanna and Relax with Max. In the 1990s he and his band Dianna Kiss had a long-standing residency at the famous Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda, Melbourne. In 2005 the original members of Daddy Cool reunited for a one-off performance at a Melbourne benefit concert in aid of the Asian tsunami disaster, and this led to the 2006 reformation of the group and the recording of a new single and album. In November 2007, the original Daddy Cool line-up reformed for a national tour of Australia with the Beach Boys & Christopher Cross. The tour took in Melbourne, Hunter Valley, Adelaide, Perth, Wollongong & Sydney. In recent years Hannaford has been a familiar figure on the streets of Melbourne, where he has been regularly busking in Melbourne's CBD and at the Camberwell Markets. Solo career In mid-2015 he released a new 10 track CD 'Hanna', which features all original compositions and 'all sounds' by Hannaford ‚Ä≤except Mau the cat (Track 7)' and Mark Ferrie on bass (Track 5). Health and death In July 2015, it was announced that Hannaford was suffering from \\"serious health issues\\", and that he had to cancel a planned national tour because he was too ill to work. Friends and colleagues, including singer-songwriter Steve Hoy and songwriter Margot Barrett (a friend and collaborator since their art school days in the late 1960s) organised a benefit concert which was staged in Melbourne to raise money for Hannaford's ongoing health care. The line-up included former Daddy Cool bandmates, Ross Wilson, Wayne Duncan and Gary Young, Steve Hoy, the RocKwiz Orchestra, The Black Sorrows, and Mike Rudd, with TV personality Brian Nankervis (RocKwiz) as MC.Julaia Irwin, \\"Music fans up on their feet for Australian rock legend Ross Hannaford\\", Northcote Leader, 11 July 2015 The first concert sold out within 24 hours and a second show was quickly organised, which also sold out. As part of a project in which people tell their life stories, filmmaker Haydn Keenan shot a long interview with Hannaford in late 2014. The interview was edited into a 60-minute DVD, with all proceeds going to the guitarist. Hannaford died on 8 March 2016, aged 65, from cancer; he had been diagnosed with the condition a year earlier.

In the early days of aviation, few aircraft were pressurized. A pilot who descended rapidly would cause his passengers the discomfort of rapid pressure changes on their eardrums. Transport pilots adopted this formula to assure a slow, steady and comfortable descent for their passengers. Many aircraft had a cruising speed between . Three miles would be traveled in about 1.5‚Äì1.8 minutes, resulting in a rate of descent of about 550‚Äì660 feet per minute (2.8 to 3.4 meters per second). That was about as fast as passengers could comfortably adapt to the changing pressure on their eardrums. However, many pilots used a 300-feet-per-minute (1.5 m/s) descent rate because doing so is almost unnoticed by passengers. A pilot cruising at would calculate that in order to be at at his destination, he would have to descend . Dividing 9,500 feet by 300 feet per minute, that descent would require about 32 minutes. If his ground speed was , he would begin his descent about from his destination (traffic permitting). The \\"rule of three\\" is used by pilots flying small, unpressurized aircraft as well as by those flying airliners and aircraft with pressurized cabins. These usually fly in a structured environment governed by instrument flight rules (IFR) and may not have the luxury of choosing a descent rate, instead observing the altitude constraints assigned to them by air traffic controllers. Although rate of cabin pressurization change may be a consideration, this is usually managed automatically and for an airliner a larger consideration is fuel economy. A 3:1 descent gives an efficient glide descent from cruising altitude, and aids in planning; the company standard descent speed will be close to (usually slightly higher than) the optimum Lift/Drag ratio speed, and will give a descent ratio close to 3:1. An additional use of this rule-of-thumb is on final approach which generally has a 3 degree vertical angle. This corresponds to 3 nautical miles (nm) per 1000 ft (equivalent to 1 km per 55 m) and again makes mental estimation simple.

The goal is to eliminate seizures or significantly reduce seizure burden. Approximately 60% of all people with epilepsy (0.4% of the population of industrialized countries) have focal epilepsy syndromes. In 15% to 20% of these patients, the condition is not adequately controlled with anticonvulsive drugs. Such patients are potential candidates for surgical epilepsy treatment. First line therapy for epilepsy involves treatment with anticonvulsive drugs, also called antiepileptic drugs. Most patients will respond to one or two different medication trials. The goal of this treatment is the elimination of seizures, since uncontrolled seizures carry significant risks, including injury and sudden death. However, in up to one third of patients, medications alone do not eliminate seizures, and/or cause adverse effects. In these patients, epilepsy surgery is considered as an alternate treatment method to medications. Generally, surgery is considered in patients whose seizures cannot be controlled by adequate trials of two different medications. Epilepsy surgery has been performed for more than a century, but its use dramatically increased in the 1980s and 1990s, reflecting its efficacy in selected patients. Evaluation The evaluation for epilepsy surgery is designed to locate the \\"epileptic focus\\" (the location of the epileptic abnormality) and to determine if resective surgery will affect normal brain function. The definition of the epileptogenic zone has a fundamental role in determining the boundaries of the area that needs to be removed in order to achieve seizure freedom but also in order not to harm ‚Äúeloquent cortex‚Äù (damage to this area produces neurological deficit). As the localization technology has improved, the definition of the epileptogenic zone has expanded to comprise a larger area of the brain than before. Resective surgery involves the resection, or cutting away, of brain tissue from the area of the brain that consists of the epileptic focus. Physicians will also confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy to make sure that spells arise from epilepsy (as opposed to non-epileptic seizures). The evaluation typically includes neurological examination, routine EEG, Long-term video-EEG monitoring, neuropsychological evaluation, and neuroimaging such as MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET). Some epilepsy centers use intracarotid sodium amobarbital test (Wada test), functional MRI (fMRI) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) as supplementary tests. Recently it has been suggested that computer models of seizure generation may provide valuable additional information regarding the source of seizures. If noninvasive testing was inadequate in identifying the epileptic focus or in distinguishing the surgical target from normal brain tissue and function, then Long-term video-EEG monitoring with the use of intracranial electrodes may be required for evaluation. Brain mapping by the technique of cortical electrical stimulation or Electrocorticography are other procedures used in the process of invasive testing for certain patients. Once the epilepsy focus is located, the specific surgery involved in treatment is decided on. The type of surgery depends on the location of the seizure focal point. Surgeries for epilepsy treatment include, but are not limited to, the following types: temporal lobe resection, hemispherectomy, ground temporal and extratemporal resection, parietal resection, occipital resection, frontal resection, extratemporal resection, and callosotomy. Hemispherectomy Hemispherectomy or hemispherotomy involves removal or a functional disconnection of most, or all of, one half of the brain typically leaving the basal ganglia and thalamus. It is reserved for people with the most catastrophic epilepsies, such as those due to Rasmussen's encephalitis. If the surgery is performed on very young patients (2‚Äì5 years old), then the remaining hemisphere may acquire some motor control of the ipsilateral body due to neuroplasticity; in older patients, paralysis results on the side of the body opposite to the part of the brain that was removed with less prospect for recovery. A visual field defect is an unavoidable side effect, typically involving a homonymous hemianopia involving loss of the half of the visual field on the same side of the disconnected brain. Because of these and other side-effects, it is usually reserved for patients having exhausted other treatment options. Temporal lobe resection Temporal lobe resection acts as a treatment option for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, or those whose seizure focus is in the temporal lobe. Temporal lobe seizures are the most common type of seizures for teens and young adults. The procedure involves resecting, or cutting away, brain tissue within the region of the temporal lobe in order to remove the seizure focus. Specific evaluation for temporal lobe resection requires convergent clinical, MRI, and EEG data in order to precisely pinpoint the focal area and boundaries of the focal area. The surgery has produced successful outcomes, controlling seizures in 65 percent of temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Follow-up studies suggest that the procedure also has produced positive long-term effects that illustrate 63 percent of patients still remaining seizure-free. Although the procedure produces positive outcomes for patients regarding seizure control, the surgery can also produce negative outcomes such as memory impairment. Impairment depends on the hemisphere of resection; temporal lobe resection of the dominant hemisphere often causes verbal memory impairment while temporal lobe resection of the non-dominant hemisphere often causes visual memory impairment. Extratemporal lobe resection Extratemporal lobe resection acts as a treatment option for patients with extratemporal epilepsy, or epilepsy patients whose seizure focus is outside of the temporal lobe, and stems from either the occipital lobes, parietal lobe, frontal lobe, or in multiple lobes. The evaluation for the procedure often requires more than clinical, MRI, and EEG convergence due to the variability of the seizure focus. Along with additional imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT, invasive studies may be needed to pinpoint the seizure focus. The efficacy of extratemporal lobe resection generally is less than resection of the temporal lobe. For example, in frontal lobe resections seizure freedom has been achieved in 38-44 percent of patients.

The limestone blocks obtained from the local alvar are exceptionally flat with little fashioning just as they come from the quarry and are very easy to stack for use in building construction.C. M. Hogan, The Stora Alvaret of Oland, Lumina Technologies, Aberdeen Library Archives, July 9, 2006 Early history Only Borgholm and Ottenby are documented in early writings to have been Viking era settlements along with Halltorp, although archaeological records show evidence of Vikings at a number of other locations on √ñland: namely, Gettlinge, Alby and Hulterstad. A manor house is thought to have existed here since at least the Late Middle Ages. In the 17th century Halltorp was integrated to the royal Borgholm estate, where Borgholm Castle is situated about seven kilometers to the north. The extensive forest area west of Halltorp Manor house ran all the way to Kalmar Strait. The kings of the House of Vasa used this woodland area as one of their prime hunting preserves. Also on site is a great European hornbeam forest, one of the largest within Sweden, that is documented to derive from at least as early as the 17th century. King Frederick I of Sweden bestowed Halltorp royal farm upon Sven Aderman in the year 1723 to acknowledge his invention of a rapid firing musket during the wars of King Karl XII. By 1760 captain Edvard Lukhehorn was reflected as the owner of Halltorp estate. It has been deduced that a grand manor house of native limestone was created in the late 18th century, which is the core of the present structure. As late as the year 1804 the estate was held by descendants of Lukhehorn. From 19th century By 1820 Halltorp estate was partitioned, with the new owners being Baron M. Falkenberg and Colonel A. Von Franchen, the latter who also served as the royal Chamberlain. In this era Halltorp still consisted of its present-day lands as well as the coastal Ekerum estate, a 180 hectare holding having several croft buildings. Then in the year 1859 a parliament member, Erik Johan Rudberg (1821-1899) bought the Halltorp holding, who held it until selling to Johan Persson in 1895. Halltorps G√§stgiveri Halltorps Gastgiveri At the end of World War I Halltorp was sold to three municipalities and was converted into a retirement home, which operated until 1973. Two years later the manor became Halltorps G√§stgiveri, an inn with guest rooms. In 1991, a twenty five guest room addition was created in the form of a new wing sweeping to the west joining in L-Plan design to the older manor core. There were also added two spas, a wine cellar, a winter garden and some conference rooms. The manor house was designed with an entrance facing east, such that upon entering the vestibule, a great hall lay immediately ahead where the present day dining room is situated. Further west of the hall were the south facing kitchen, still the current day kitchen, and two other rooms facing north which have now been adapted to reception areas of the present day inn. The original first floor had a large loft, which area is now converted to guest rooms.Halltorps Gastgiveri Description, Halltorps G√§stgiveri, Borgholm (2004) Halltorps Hage Halltorps hage, the nature reserve at Halltorp lies to the west of the manor house extending to the Kalmar Strait. In addition to the ancient oak forest, this area is known for several wild orchids including: Common spotted orchid, Dactylorhiza fuchsii; Listera ovata; and Bird‚Äôs-nest orchid, Neottia nidus-avis. Many other rare and endangered species can be found to the east on the Stora Alvaret, although in this northern part of √ñland the alvar habitat is more fragmented than in the south of the island where large expanses of limestone pavement ecosystem exist.H√•kan Sandbring and Martin Borg, Oland: Island of Stone and Green, May, 1997 See also * Kalmar Strait References External links *Halltorp website * Halltorp Nature Reserve (in Swedish) Category:Houses in Sweden Category:√ñland Category:Buildings and structures in Kalmar County Category:Geography of Kalmar County Category:Tourist attractions in Kalmar County Category:Nature reserves in Sweden ","title":"Halltorp"},{"id":"7215102","text":"Bette may refer to: People * Bette (given name) * Jean-Christophe Bette, French competitive rower * The noble House of Bette: the Marquess of Lede: ** Guillaum de Bette, 1st Marquess of Lede ** Ambroise de Bette, 2nd Marquess of Lede ** Jean Fran√ßois de Bette, 3rd Marquess of Lede ** Emannuel de Bette, 4th Marquess of Lede ** Fran√ßoise de Bette Other * Bette (album), by Bette Midler * Bette (TV series), a program starring Bette Midler See also * The Best of Bette (disambiguation) * Betty (disambiguation) ","title":"Bette"},{"id":"7215120","text":"Nicanor (; Nƒ´kƒÅÃÅn≈çr) was a Macedonian officer of distinction who served as satrap of Media under Antigonus (possibly Nicanor of Stageira, who served under Alexander the Great).

Racial and cultural issues Since the late 1990s, and especially since the retirement of Michael Jordan in 1999, the NBA has been criticized for embracing hip hop culture. While some observers have argued that this criticism has more to do with race than hip hop itself, it is a fact that the league is very much connected to hip hop culture. Rappers Nelly and Jay-Z had ownership stakes in NBA teams (the Charlotte Hornets and Brooklyn Nets respectively), and many artists have worn NBA throwback jerseys in music videos. In turn, the NBA plays rap and hip-hop in arenas during games. NBA video games NBA 2K and NBA Live use hip- hop in their soundtracks, and ABC/ESPN also use the music during its coverage. Players in the NBA have tried having rap or hip hop careers themselves (Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, Allen Iverson, Chris Webber, Damian Lillard and Ron Artest are some examples) and several also dress and act in ways that are in accordance with the hip hop culture (for example, the tattoos and jewelry worn by several players). Some have argued that the criticism of the NBA is hypocritical, considering the relative lack of criticism of Major League Baseball (MLB), National Hockey League (NHL) or National Football League (NFL) players. Some have also noticed that music genres and sports partnerships are not limited to the NBA, with alternative rock and hard rock being associated with the NHL, and country music being associated with NASCAR. This criticism has remained a major factor in the NBA's unorthodox place in the American cultural sphere, where the league's cultural image can be off-putting to (mostly white) sports fans who readily dismiss the league from their personal viewing diet. Donald Sterling Accusations of discrimination In February 2009, Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was sued by former longtime Clippers executive Elgin Baylor for employment discrimination on the basis of age and race.Lisa Dillman, Elgin Baylor sues Clippers, claiming racism, Los Angeles Times, February 12, 2009, Retrieved February 13, 2009. The lawsuit alleges Sterling told Baylor that he wanted to fill his team with \\"poor black boys from the South and a white head coach\\".Bill Plaschke, There are no winners in Elgin Baylor's lawsuit against Clippers, Los Angeles Times, February 13, 2009, Retrieved February 13, 2009. The suit alleges that during negotiations for Danny Manning, Sterling said \\"I'm offering a lot of money for a poor black kid.\\"Lisa Dillman, Mention of David Stern is an error in Elgin Baylor's lawsuit, Los Angeles Times, February 14, 2009, Retrieved February 13, 2009. The suit noted those comments while alleging \\"the Caucasian head coach was given a four-year, $22-million contract\\", but Baylor's salary had \\"been frozen at a comparatively paltry $350,000 since 2003\\". Accusation of racism On April 25, 2014, TMZ Sports released what it said is an April 9, 2014 audio recording of a conversation between Sterling and his mistress, V. Stiviano. According to TMZ, Sterling and Stiviano argued in regards to a photo Stiviano posted on Instagram in which she posed with Magic Johnson. In the audio recording, Sterling allegedly tells Stiviano: \\"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you‚Äôre associating with black people.\\" and, \\"You can sleep with [black people]. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want\\", but \\"the little I ask you is ... not to bring them to my games\\". Clippers president Andy Roesen issued a statement the following day, indicating that his organization was unsure if it was a legitimate and unaltered recording, that the sentiments attributed to Sterling did not reflect Sterling's views, and that the woman on the recording was being sued by the Sterling family and had \\"told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even' with him\\". The Los Angeles chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) cancelled its plans for the following month to award Sterling for a second time with its lifetime achievement award. President Barack Obama characterized the recording attributed to Sterling as \\"incredibly offensive racist statements\\". Obama then stated, \\"When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don‚Äôt really have to do anything, you just let them talk.\\" On April 29, the NBA, upon confirming the taped conversations, announced that Sterling has been banned for life and fined $2.5 million.\\"NBA bans Clippers owner Sterling for life\\" from CNN (April 29, 2014) Dress code Perhaps mainly because of the above-mentioned criticism, the NBA instituted a dress code in 2005, banning all clothing associated with the hip hop culture. Players were instructed not to wear jewelry, throwback jerseys, headphones, indoor sunglasses and other accessories, and instead were told to wear \\"business casual\\" clothing. The dress code, characterized by some as \\"clearly and unapologetically directed toward suppressing hip-hop culture\\", was instantly controversial and a topic on many sports radio talk shows for several days. Baggy shorts, also a symbol of hip hop culture, were banned by the league as well, which instituted a rule on the length of players' shorts while playing. Tights, which players started to wear under their shorts in the 2005‚Äì06 season (though not a symbol of hip hop culture) were banned as well. No players were fined for dress code violations during the 2005‚Äì06 season. The league has also attempted to more greatly distance itself from hip hop since the infamous Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl in 2004; in the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, country music stars Big and Rich performed at halftime, a move that was ridiculed by TNT analyst and former NBA player Charles Barkley. In addition, as noted later in this article, ABC Sports (after relying on hip-hop music early on) has used artists such as Rob Thomas and Tom Petty for the NBA Finals in recent years. Team relocation controversies Vancouver Grizzlies move to Memphis The Vancouver Grizzlies moved to Memphis, Tennessee after the 2000‚Äì01 NBA season. On January 25, 2001, it was announced that the Grizzlies would be sold by Orca Bay Sports & Entertainment to Michael Heisley, who originally intended to keep the team in Vancouver. However, the team moved, in part due to the weak Canadian dollar, lack of local ownership, and the unwillingness of some players to live in Canada. After a bidding war between Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans, Heisley selected Memphis as the relocation destination for the Grizzlies on March 26, 2001. Heisley selected Memphis because it offered a better deal and had better local executive leadership than Louisville. Eventually, the NBA Board of Governors approved the team's plans to move to Memphis on July 4, 2001 and the team became the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2001‚Äì02 NBA season. Seattle SuperSonics move to Oklahoma City The Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City after the 2007‚Äì08 NBA season. After failed efforts to persuade Washington state government officials to provide funding to update KeyArena, the SuperSonics' ownership group, led by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, sold the team to Professional Basketball Club LLC (PBC), an investment group headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett. After failing to persuade local governments to fund a US$500 million arena complex, Bennett's group notified the NBA that it intended to move the team to Oklahoma City and requested arbitration with the city of Seattle to be released from its lease with KeyArena. When the request was rejected by a judge, Seattle sued Bennett's group to enforce the lease that required the team to play in KeyArena through 2010. On July 2, 2008, a settlement was reached that allowed the team to move under certain conditions. Details of the settlement revealed that PBC would pay the city of Seattle $45 million immediately in exchange for breaking the KeyArena lease and an additional $30 million if Seattle was not given a replacement team in five years. Also, according to the conditions of the settlement, the Sonics' name and colors could not be used by the team in Oklahoma City, but could be taken by a future team in Seattle, although no promises for a replacement team were given. The Oklahoma City team would retain the franchise history of the SuperSonics, which could be \\"shared\\" with any future NBA team in Seattle. The team moved to Oklahoma City immediately and became the Oklahoma City Thunder, beginning play for the 2008‚Äì09 NBA season.Details of settlement between Bennett, Seattle revealed, August 21, 2008 Altercations Latrell Sprewell choking incident In 1997, Latrell Sprewell was involved in arguably the most infamous incident in the NBA prior to the Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl seven years later. During a contentious practice, then-Golden State Warrior Sprewell was involved in an altercation with head coach P.J. Carlesimo in which he choked his coach and threatened to kill him. The incident brought mainstream attention, but not quite the amount of criticism of the league as a whole as later controversies would. While some wondered if Sprewell's actions were indicative of a growing trend in the league, others tempered that belief with the idea that it was an isolated incident. Then active player Buck Williams said this on PBS: Sprewell would have his image redeemed somewhat after a run to the NBA Finals with the New York Knicks in 1999. However, after a contentious battle with the Minnesota Timberwolves over his salary in 2004, his image took another hit. Sprewell retired for good in 2005. After his retirement, he suffered several financial difficulties, including his home being foreclosed on and having his yacht forcibly seized and sold at auction. Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl Ron Artest was a major participant in the infamous Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl. After a massive altercation between Indiana Pacers players and Detroit Pistons fans on November 19, 2004, the NBA came under severe criticism from the national and mainstream media. Commentators, and those familiar with the event outside the sports media, were divided over the issues of who should primarily be blamed for the incident. Anger and blame was placed on the players, at NBA Union Chief Billy Hunter, who protested the length of suspensions, the fans who sparked the melee and the referees who did not put a stop to it. Some in the media viewed the brawl as a statement on the disconnect between white fans and black players. USA Todays Ian O'Connor wrote: In the wake of the brawl, the NBA came under harsh scrutiny from some outlets. Noted conservative radio personality (and former ESPN NFL analyst) Rush Limbaugh said the brawl was \\"hip-hop culture on parade\\" and also added the statement that \\"NBA uniforms are now in gang colors. They are in gang styles.\\" NBA commissioner David Stern, in a 2006 interview, made this comment about the brawl-related criticism: Knicks‚ÄìNuggets brawl The Knicks- Nuggets brawl was an on-court altercation at an NBA game between the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets at Madison Square Garden on December 16, 2006. This altercation was the most penalized on-court fight since the Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl. All ten players on the court at the time of the altercation were ejected, and seven players total were suspended. Carmelo Anthony of the Nuggets was suspended for 15 games, while J. R. Smith and Nate Robinson were suspended for 10 games each. Neither coach was suspended; still, some believed that then-Knicks coach Isiah Thomas should have been suspended for allegedly telling his players to foul any Nuggets player who attempted a dunk or layup. NBA Commissioner David Stern received criticism for not including Thomas in the suspensions. Some viewed Stern's leniency as evidence of a special relationship with Thomas. Thomas was accused of trying to bring back the mentality of the late 1980s Detroit Pistons, who were known for their physical play. Various columnists and observers found Thomas' actions inappropriate; before the fight, Thomas was seen warning Anthony not to go into the lane. ESPN analyst and former NBA player Greg Anthony stated that \\"I never had a coach say that to an opponent ... I've had a coach say, do a better job protecting our territory. That's a little different.\\" The fight brought a large amount of media attention, and was a topic on mainstream news broadcasts, including World News with Charles Gibson. Several columnists claimed that the NBA had been set back several years, and many used the fight as evidence of the league being a haven for thugs. Knicks guard Steve Francis noted that the media reaction to the fight and the suspensions itself were \\"racially motivated\\". Francis argued that MLB and the NHL had fights worse or equal to the Knicks/Nuggets altercation and rarely faced the type of media attention and scrutiny that the NBA received. Several columnists agreed, including Sam Smith (who called the coverage \\"racist and nonsense\\" in a piece), J. A. Adande and David Aldridge. Age limit In 2005, the NBA was in the midst of creating a new collective bargaining agreement. One of the main topics of the deal was the league's desire to create a new age limit for players to enter the NBA draft. The idea of an age limit had been talked about for several years, after the entrance into the league of several high school players. While several players who have entered the league out of high school have become successes (Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Dwight Howard, J. R. Smith, Amar'e Stoudemire, Jermaine O'Neal, Rashard Lewis, Tracy McGrady, and decades ago, Shawn Kemp and Moses Malone), others have been relative failures (for example, Ndudi Ebi, James Lang, Kwame Brown, Sebastian Telfair, Eddy Curry, Robert Swift, DeSagana Diop). Those in favor of an age limit made the argument that players entering the league out of high school did not know the fundamentals of playing professional basketball and also were not mature enough to handle playing in the NBA. Proponents of the age limit included Michael Wilbon, who argued that it was important for young players to get an education. Wilbon's belief, while held by many, has also been referred to as \\"simplistic\\" and \\"[reflective] not just [of] hypocrisy but a reimagination of reality as well\\". Michael Mccann of the Mississippi College School of Law made this argument: Greg Anthony was one prominent NBA personality against the age limit. Anthony's belief was that people should be able to make their own decisions about whether or not to enter the league, and that (quoting an article and not Anthony himself) \\"players from inner-city high schools aren't academically qualified for college because of the lower quality of education compared to their suburban counterparts\\". This led him into conflict with Wilbon and Stephen A. Smith. On an April 2005 edition of NBA Shootaround, Anthony and Smith got into a heated debate about the age- limit. This came only days after Anthony was the primary interviewer in a discussion with Indiana Pacers forward Jermaine O'Neal. The interview was described by Sports Illustrated writer Mark Bechtel as \\"...Greg Anthony putting words in O'Neal's mouth then saying something along the lines of, 'Is that what you meant?' And then O'Neal would say, 'Exactly.'\\" It came on the heels of O'Neal discussing the age limit in the context of race, and as he was in the midst of growing media attention and criticism. As noted in the article The Real Color of Money: Controlling Black Bodies in the NBA by David Leonard, O'Neal was roundly attacked for his opinion, with many accusing him of playing the race card. With the agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, the age limit was put into place. Any person attempting to enter the NBA draft must wait until the calendar year of his 19th birthday, and must also be at least one year out of high school. However, since the implementation of these rules, certain players have used alternative methods to enter the draft, to the point where some players declare while even still playing in high school. Players like Brandon Jennings, Emmanuel Mudiay, and Terrance Ferguson have entered their respective NBA drafts while spending a year out overseas. More recently, some players like Satnam Singh, Thon Maker, and Matur Maker have entered their respective NBA drafts while being considered as high school postgraduates, meaning they've played a fifth year of high school basketball for various reasons instead of going to college. Furthermore, both Latavious Williams and Mitchell Robinson entered their NBA drafts by entering the NBA Development League (now NBA G League) and skipping out college for a year respectively. No tolerance rule At the start of the 2006‚Äì07 NBA season, the NBA instituted a new rule regarding in-game player complaints. The \\"no tolerance rule\\", as it was referred to by players and the media, allowed referees to call technical fouls when players complained too vehemently about calls. The season started with a spike in the number of technical fouls and ejections. There were \\"one-hundred-four technicals and seven ejections in the first fifty-one games\\", while \\"only seven games of the first fifty-one games thus far have had no technical fouls\\". Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony, who would be suspended for his participation in a fight later that year, was suspended on opening night of the season after two technical fouls. Some observers viewed the rule as unfair and taking the passion out of the game; others believed that it only served to take pressure off of referees who made bad calls. Others agreed with the rule, viewing it as a much needed policy to cut down on the \\"whining\\" by players in the league. After the initial spike at the start of the season, the amount of technical fouls and ejections declined significantly towards the middle of the year. Several players, including Denver Nuggets guard Allen Iverson, were still ejected on technical fouls; Iverson's ejection came during his first game against his former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, and he was later fined by the league for claiming that referee Steve Javie ejected him on the basis of a feud the two supposedly had. Conspiracies Big-market team bias Some NBA fans have accused the league of conspiring to have large-market teams and popular players succeed in the postseason. Since 1980, every NBA Finals has involved at least one of the following teams: Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat or San Antonio Spurs. Additionally, in that span, every NBA Finals has involved at least one of the following All-Star players: Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James or Stephen Curry. Many of these accusations are based on the premise that the NBA desires large markets and popular players for ratings purposes. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson disputes the idea that matchups have the biggest effect on ratings: This conspiracy has only increased with the rise of so-called \\"superteams\\" in free agency, where star players (free agents or not) \\"team up\\" with other players of similar stature on a large-market team in a lucrative location. The term has evolved after being brought about by James' public free-agent declaration in 2010's The Decision. Notable examples of players leaving a smaller market to either join or create said \\"superteam\\" include James (Cleveland to Miami), Kevin Durant (Oklahoma City to Golden State), and Paul George (Oklahoma City to LA Clippers). The first two moves in particular drew considerable backlash, especially James's due to favorite son status in his home state. Some have even speculated this has caused NBA ratings in recent seasons to drop due to a lack of narrative surprise in the regular season. 1984 NBA Finals ‚Äì Celtics vs. Lakers The 1984 NBA Finals was highly anticipated, with the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers playing in their eighth Finals matchup ever since their first showdown in 1969. It also featured two of the biggest young stars of the era, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who had previously faced off in the finals of the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament, where Magic's Michigan State team defeated Bird's Indiana State squad. Game 6 proved controversial when the Lakers were sent to the foul line on numerous occasions thanks to questionable calls. This led Larry Bird to claim that Commissioner David Stern had requested that the game be officiated in the Lakers' favor in hopes of extending the series to a seventh game. Despite his conspiracy claim, the Celtics did win in Game 7, earning a 111-102 victory. 1988 NBA Finals - Pistons vs. Lakers The 1988 NBA Finals was yet another highly anticipated matchup, with the Detroit Pistons entering into the Finals for the first time ever against the Los Angeles Lakers. It also featured two of the biggest stars in their prime with Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas. The Pistons took a 3-2 series lead. With 14 seconds remaining in Game 6 and the Pistons up 102-101, Bill Laimbeer was called for a foul on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Laimbeer fouled out on the call and Abdul-Jabbar made both free throws to give the Lakers a 103-102 victory. The Lakers won Game 7 108-105, clinching the title. In his 1993 book, The Winner Within, Lakers coach Pat Riley referred to the call as \\"that phantom skyhook foul.\\" 2001 Eastern Conference Finals ‚Äì Bucks vs. Sixers In 2001, the Milwaukee Bucks played the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The small-market Bucks (who had not even been featured on NBC that year prior to the second round of the Playoffs) did not have any \\"big-time\\" stars, with the exception of Ray Allen (who, despite being popular, was not in the upper-echelon of NBA players in terms of endorsements). Their opponent that year, the 76ers had the polarizing and popular Allen Iverson, who had a multitude of shoe deals and mainstream recognition. The Sixers also featured that year's winners of the MVP award in Iverson, Defensive Player of the Year award in Dikembe Mutombo, Sixth Man of the Year award in Aaron McKie, and Coach of the Year award in Larry Brown. During game 5, there were numerous major favourable calls for the 76ers. Glenn Robinson had not gone to the foul line in any of the previous games, causing them to be viewed as suspect. Allen later voiced the claim that the league preferred the Sixers to be in the Finals as opposed to Milwaukee. This controversy is largely based on complaints levied by members of the Bucks organization regarding the officiating of the series. Glenn Robinson, Sam Cassell and then-head coach George Karl joined Allen in complaining about the officiating and hinting that the league was against them. Karl and Allen were both fined for their comments. In Game 6 of the tensely fought series, Bucks forward Scott Williams threw an elbow at Iverson and was subsequently suspended for the deciding Game 7. (Iverson had already missed a game, the Bucks Game 3 win, and been limited in others after being hit by the Bucks earlier in the series.) After the Bucks lost Game 7 on the road, Sports Illustrated columnist Marty Burns insinuated that the suspension may have been a form of payback by the league: While normally a starter, Williams generally played limited minutes and averaged just over 4 points per game during the portion of the series in which he played. He was suspended because this was his third flagrant foul of the playoffs. The Sixers were fourth in the league in regular season free throws attempted. The Bucks, largely a jump shooting team, were 25th. 2002 Western Conference Finals ‚Äì Kings Vs. Lakers The 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Lakers was one of the most memorable in league history. The popular (though small-market) Kings led the two-time defending NBA champion Lakers three games to two heading into Game 6 at Staples Center, a game which would prove to be the most infamous of the series. The game, which the Lakers won by four, featured several disputable calls, including a late game no-call involving Mike Bibby‚Äîafter he was bleeding from being elbowed in the nose by Kobe Bryant. This game was the epitome of the major issue in the series. Both teams complained about the officiating at different points in the series (the Kings in Game 6 and the Lakers in Games 2 and 5). Quoting then-ESPN basketball analyst David Aldridge: Former presidential candidate Ralph Nader weighed in on the series, voicing his displeasure with the officiating: The Kings would go on to lose Game 7 of the series at home. Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy filed in court papers in 2008 saying that Game 6 was fixed by the NBA. NBA Commissioner David Stern denies the allegations. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led a review of the league's officiating following the outbreak of the scandal, concluded that, while Game 6 was poorly officiated, no concrete evidence existed of that game being fixed. Accusation from Jeff Van Gundy During a 2005 playoff series against the Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy was fined a record amount for a coach, $100,000, for asserting that he had a source within the league who informed him that the referees were being instructed to call more fouls on Yao Ming, due to protests by Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. 2006 NBA Finals ‚Äì Dallas vs. Miami The 2006 NBA Finals came the year after a series that saw the second-lowest ratings in NBA Finals history. After the Detroit Pistons and the small-market San Antonio Spurs slugged it out in a seven-game series, the 2006 Finals was considered more attractive because it featured the relatively large markets Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks and superstars Dirk Nowitzki, Shaquille O'Neal, and Dwyane Wade. With the series tied at two games apiece, Game 5 was pivotal. On the final possession in overtime, Wade received an inbounds pass from mid court. Because Wade had already been in the front court prior to the inbounds of the ball, some argue that he should have been ruled ineligible to receive the pass in the backcourt and the Heat should have been called for a backcourt violation. After receiving the ball, Wade went on to drive to the basket, drawing a foul on Nowitzki. Replays would reveal that Nowitzki barely touched Wade, further angering Mavericks fans. However, the replay also showed Mavericks' guard Devin Harris grabbing Wade's arm. In between Wade's free throws, Maverick Josh Howard looked to coach Avery Johnson to see if he wanted to call for time. Howard made a timeout gesture towards his coach; referee Joe Derosa saw this and charged Dallas with their final timeout. Without a timeout, the Mavericks were forced to inbound from full court after Wade hit his second free throw. Unable to get off a shot from inside of half court as time expired, the Mavericks lost the game and the series two nights later. Game 5 had 38 fouls called against the Mavericks with only 26 against the Heat. The Mavericks shot 25 free throws as the Heat shot 49. After Game 5, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was livid; he was quoted by The Miami Herald as screaming at David Stern that \\"[his] league is rigged\\". Cuban denied making the statement, and went on to write: Despite his denial, Cuban was fined $250,000 by the league, not for his alleged comments, but for general \\"acts of misconduct\\" following the game. In Game 5, Wade shot a total of 25 free throws, equaling the entire Mavericks team total. In Game 6, suspicions ran even higher as the Heat were awarded 37 free throws compared to the Mavericks‚Äô 23. Wade shot a total of 21 free throws, nearly matching the Mavericks‚Äô team total, including those from a foul called after bumping into Nowitzki, who was standing in Wade's way during the last 10 seconds of play, which cost them the game and allowed the Heat to walk away with their first championship. Following the season, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban allegedly hired a former FBI agent to investigate the series. He supposedly dropped this investigation due to the risk of him being banned from the league for life. 2007 Western Conference Semi-finals ‚Äì Suns vs. Spurs In what some media outlets claimed were the true 2007 NBA Finals that year, the 2007 Western Conference Semi- Finals match bettered heated rivals in the Phoenix Suns and the San Antonio Spurs under what would be the most controversial series between the two to date. The popular Phoenix Suns squad under the Seven Seconds or Less and the small-market San Antonio Spurs kicked off the series with a 111‚Äì106 Spurs win with a collision between Steve Nash and Tony Parker, with Nash having a deep cut on his nose that later forced him to sit out for a good portion of Game 1. After a dominant 101‚Äì81 performance from the Suns in Game 2, the Spurs would end Game 3 with a 108‚Äì101 win over the Suns and Manu Gin√≥bili would have a bruised, black eye after he was poked by Shawn Marion. However, near the end of Game 4, the series would reach its critical breaking point. In the last minute of Game 4, where the Suns would win 104‚Äì98 and even up the series, Robert Horry of the Spurs collided with Steve Nash during a play and pushed Nash into the scorer's table mid-court. During this altercation, Raja Bell of the Suns would try to help his teammate out of there, but was stopped by the referees and players at hand, including Amar'e Stoudemire and Boris Diaw, who were on the team's bench at the time of the altercation. As a result of the altercation between Horry and Nash, not only would Horry receive a two-game suspension for his outburst, but Diaw and Stoudemire would also be suspended for Game 5 as well, with the only rule that league commissioner David Stern said they violated at that point was leaving the bench during an altercation. Suns head coach Mike D'Antoni weighed in on the suspensions of Stoudemire and Diaw, seeing as how they were important pieces for the Suns, questioning the fairness on their suspensions despite not being instigators in it: The suspensions would prove to be the Suns' downfall near the end of the series. Despite leading most of Game 5 at home, the Suns would lose it 88‚Äì85 and would then lose Game 6 and the series in San Antonio 114‚Äì106, being down by as many as 20 points in the third quarter at one point despite the returns of Stoudemire and Diaw. The call on their suspensions would be further questioned and criticized in 2009 after a similar situation occurred with the Boston Celtics, yet certain key players on their team didn't receive similar suspensions themselves. In the aftermath of the 2007 Playoffs, one of the referees that was involved with this series, Tim Donaghy, was involved in a betting scandal that claimed fix-ups on certain NBA games and playoff series's. During a 2011 interview, he admitted that he felt the Suns were the better team that season, but the series was poorly officiated from the very start until the bitter end. In his 2009 book Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA, Donaghy stated the following about the series, particularly about his supervisor during the series, Tommy Nu√±ez: 2007 NBA Finals ‚Äì San Antonio vs. Cleveland The 2007 NBA Finals are considered to have the lowest television ratings in NBA history, after the San Antonio Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers. Many fans instead expected a Detroit Pistons rematch with the Spurs from the 2005 NBA Finals. Rasheed Wallace, who then played power forward for the Pistons following the 2006‚Äì07 NBA season, claimed that the league wanted to make more money by featuring LeBron James in the Finals instead of the Pistons, just to make more excitement rather than the boring matches like they had two years ago. Despite his controversial statement around the start of the next season, the Pistons were able to make it back to the 2008 NBA Playoffs as a second seed, in which they managed to defeat Philadelphia after rallying from a 2 games to 1 deficit and Orlando in the next round 4 games to 1, before reaching the Eastern Conference Finals again and ending up losing to the eventual champion Boston Celtics for the third year in a row. That would lead to the downfall of the team following the start of the 2008-09 NBA season, in which several players from their 2004 championship team either ended up departing or retiring. 2009 Eastern Conference First Round ‚Äì Bulls vs. Celtics During a 2009 playoff series between the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls, many Bulls fans felt that the referees were favoring the Celtics. In Game 5, Celtics guard Rajon Rondo made hard contact with the face of Bulls' center Brad Miller, with just 2 seconds left in overtime with the Celtics leading by two. Earlier in Game 5, Rondo tripped Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich, forcing him to get stitches to close the resulting wounds he got from being tripped. The hit on Miller left him with a bleeding mouth, but because the foul was ruled a personal foul, Miller had to shoot the free throws, or he would not have been allowed to return, and the Celtics would pick the replacement shooter. Had the foul been ruled a flagrant, the Bulls would have been able to pick the replacement shooter. Miller would miss the first free throw, and then had to miss the second on purpose to give the Bulls a chance to tie the game, but the free throw did not hit the rim and the Celtics got possession and ran out the clock. Rondo admitted after the game that he did not have a play on the ball. In Game 6, near the end of the first quarter, Rondo threw Hinrich into the scorer's table in a fashion similar to Robert Horry's body slam of Steve Nash 2 years earlier. Rondo was assessed a flagrant 1, which allowed for him to stay in the game, rather than a flagrant 2 which would have meant an ejection (which was Horry's punishment for his similar foul). Furthermore, after both games, the league reviewed the incidents in question and decided not to suspend Rondo or upgrade the fouls, while Horry's body slam earned him a 2-game suspension. Meanwhile, Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard was suspended for Game 6 of the Magic's series vs. the Philadelphia 76ers after the league reviewed tape of him elbowing Sixers center Samuel Dalembert in the head in Game 5. It was ruled a technical on the floor, but after review, the league upgraded the foul to a flagrant 2. 2009 NBA Finals ‚Äì Magic vs. Lakers The 2009 NBA Finals was one of the most forgettable matchups and featured the Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Lakers. It was mockingly dubbed as the 'Disney Series'. While many fans claimed that it should've been a matchup between Cleveland and the Lakers and a duel of superstars Kobe Bryant and LeBron James following the knee injury of Boston Celtics' power forward Kevin Garnett. Others believed the Magic should have won the championship instead of the Lakers, due to many calls which were claimed to have been favouring the Lakers, along with nine out of ten analysts favouring the Lakers to be the winning team, compared to only one favouring the Magic to win. Many of the news also hinted about Jameer Nelson returning to the line up to play during the regular season, where he led the Magic to sweep the Lakers following the presumable season-ending injury of a torn labrum in his right shoulder during a home game vs. Dallas on February 2, 2009. But it was later confirmed that he would be playing. While the series went to L.A. with the Lakers up 2-0, it went back to Orlando for game 3. A controversial call on Dwight Howard after attempting to block Kobe Bryant has raised questions for the league about favoring L.A all the way. Following the call, Bryant only hit one out of two free throw at the line. In the game, Los Angeles had a terrible free throw percentage, which lead to Orlando winning that game. In Game 4, the most intense moment of the game came during the first half. The Magic had a 12 point lead and outscored the Lakers by as much as 49-37 before going into halftime. In the third quarter, the Lakers came out and outscored the Magic 30‚Äì14 and took the lead 67-62. Questioning about Stan Van Gundy wanting to keep Jameer Nelson playing for rest of the 4th quarter came under heavy criticism for not letting Rafer Alston to play, especially with the decision of whether or not to foul Orlando with 11 seconds left, which ultimately led to their downfall heading into Overtime following Derek Fisher hitting a pivotal 3-pointer to tie it at 87 due to Nelsons poor defense and was questioned after the game. Another argument came during overtime, with Nelson and Lewis double teaming Bryant, Nelson got hit by Bryant's elbow and no foul was called, before Fisher hit another 3-pointer to take the lead 94-91, which let the Lakers win the game by that score and take a 3-1 lead. That raised questions about which calls the referees failed to call, following another infamous series years ago, in which a similar incident happened in Game 6 of that season's Western Conference Finals after Kobe's elbow to Mike Bibby with less than 30 seconds left. Only this time with Jameer Nelson, but was rebuffed. Later on, Rafer Alston's commented on the league for the no call. However, all arguments about the officiating fell on deaf ears as the Lakers won game 5 for their 15th championship. NBA Draft The 1985 NBA draft was the first to use the NBA Draft Lottery. Prior to that year, there was a coin flip between the teams with the worst record in each conference to see which team would get the first pick in the draft. The Golden State Warriors, which represent the San Francisco Bay Area, finished with the worst record in the NBA during the 1984‚Äì85 season and would have had the first draft choice under the previous system. That year, Georgetown center Patrick Ewing was the favorite to be the number one pick in the draft. The lottery was established out of concern that the Houston Rockets had been intentionally playing poorly in order to draft the best players, such as centers Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon in 1983 and 1984 respectively. During the first live televised draft lottery ceremony, the league used a system where sealed envelopes representing the teams with the worst records were mixed in a tumbler, and then drawn by NBA Commissioner David Stern one at a time to determine which of these clubs would get the first pick onwards. However, when these envelopes were added to the tumbler, one envelope was put in forcibly and banged against the edge, bending the corner, while all the rest of the envelopes were set in gently. Stern closely watched the tumbler spinning and took a deep breath when drawing for the first pick, and went for the envelope with the bent corner, which upon opening the envelope, it was revealed that the New York Knicks logo was inside. The large-market New York Knicks, who finished with the third-worst record in the league that season, eventually used the first pick to draft Ewing who would become a legend on the team and lead the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals. (Although the Knicks also reached the 1999 NBA Finals, Ewing was injured during that time). Nevertheless, the \\"bent envelope\\" fueled speculation that the league staged the result. As a response to the controversy, the NBA would update their system to the more modern weighted lottery system in 1990, which gives the worst teams better odds at receiving the top 3 (later 4) picks of the NBA draft. Nevertheless, the system would receive updates in both 1994, when the Orlando Magic landed back-to-back #1 picks despite their second year having only one lottery combination possible in their chances of winning it, and 2019, after noticing the Philadelphia 76ers looked to lose on purpose for multiple seasons for higher draft picks under Sam Hinkie's regime. For the 2003 NBA draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each had equal chances of drafting first overall, with the Cavaliers ultimately winning out. With high school basketball standout and future four-time NBA MVP LeBron James being the consensus number one pick in that year's draft, there was some speculation as to whether or not that year's lottery was rigged in favor of the Cavaliers, due to James being a native of nearby Akron, Ohio.http://www.cbssports.com/nba/story/6381961 Following James' departure for the Miami Heat in 2010, the Cavaliers would be involved in further speculation in regards to winning three out of four NBA drafts between 2011 and 2014, some of which included the idea of LeBron James returning to the Cavaliers altogether from these drafts; James would ultimately return to Cleveland in 2014. For the 2008 NBA draft, despite having a 1.6% chance of obtaining the number one pick, projected by many to be Chicago native Derrick Rose, the Chicago Bulls still were awarded the first overall pick and subsequently selected Rose as the first pick. Rose would go on to win NBA Rookie of the Year in the 2008‚Äì09 season and would win the NBA MVP in the 2010‚Äì2011 season while leading the Bulls to the Eastern Conference Finals that same season. The New Orleans Hornets won the rights to the first overall selection in the 2012 draft. The Hornets were a league-owned team prior to the draft, leading to continued conspiracy theories about the lottery process. Further suspicions were raised in 2016 and 2017, where former 76ers player Dikembe Mutombo congratulated Philadelphia for winning the first overall pick in the 2016 draft early via Twitter and recently hired Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson and coach Luke Walton stating that the Lakers were going to get a Top 3 pick in the 2017 draft despite having higher odds of losing the pick to Philadelphia weeks before the draft lottery even began that year respectively. The latter selection also had the Lakers be in prime position to take Lonzo Ball, a prime high school and college standout point guard from nearby Chino Hills, California, with his father LaVar talking about him being on the Lakers months before the event took place. Fines and suspensions Criticism of referees and officiating Players, coaches or front office members criticizing referees, officials or suggesting in any way that the league has conspiracy theories would result in an automatic fine of a minimum of $25,000. Media and fans see this as the league trying to discourage such discussions and comments, as they indeed have things to hide. The league also fears such would have impact ratings and popularity, resulting in lower ratings and most importantly, revenue. Gestures Sam Cassell's Big Cahones dance celebration (from Major League II) are now seen as \\"obscene gestures\\". Among those who have also been fined for \\"dancing\\" are Caron Butler, Andray Blatche, Marco Belinelli, Andre Iguodala and Jameer Nelson. The fine has been documented to be a minimum of $15,000. Restgate and scheduling In November 2012, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was fined $250,000 for sending four players home (including stars Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Gin√≥bili) before a nationally televised game against the defending champion Miami Heat. It was the Spurs' fourth game in five nights and sixth game in nine nights, all of which were on the road. Commissioner David Stern released a letter before the game claiming Popovich had done a disservice to the league, fans and Miami ticket buyers by not giving them the game they paid to see. Most disagreed with Stern, saying Miami fans were there to see LeBron James and the Heat, not the Spurs. Many felt this was a cultural revenge move by Stern, who in the past had openly admitted he disliked the Spurs' success due to the lack of ratings they brought to the Finals as a small market team. The Spurs ended up leading for most of the game and only lost in the last minute, making Stern appear even more foolish for claiming the game was ruined before it even began. Stern later said that if Popovich had simply kept the players with the team he wouldn't have fined him, which went against his initial claim that the product on the court was diminished by who didn't play. The incident also called into question the league's scheduling practices, such as cramming so many games into a short amount of time, especially like in the Spurs' case where the team had to travel between each game. Some called for an end to four-games-in-five-nights and five-games- in-seven-nights situations as it could put the players' health at risk and diminishes the product on the court. Selective TV replays While the league has implemented TV replays, as of the 2013‚Äì14 season, plays are not reviewable unless they are end of quarter plays, as well as the last 2 minutes of regulation and overtime periods. In many cases, referees have opted not to review final plays of the game, which would have impact on the final win-loss outcome. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, regular season games such as the Heat-Pacers, Mavericks-Timberwolves, Mavericks-Pelicans, Clippers-Mavericks, games have resulted in the controversial calls in the final play of the game that changed the outcome. In some cases, the NBA issued official statements after the game, admitting to the errors, however, the game's outcome remained unchanged. Many believe that such statements merely made as a PR move, although no action is done to improve the integrity of the game. Many criticize too much time spent on replays that could have been resolved within short amounts of time. Oftentimes, the amount of time spent puts the game into long halts. The league is seen as intentionally operating in a way give negative perception of replays in general, as well as merely exaggerating their image of trying to keep the integrity of the game honest. Joey Crawford Joey Crawford was once suspended by the league after a confrontation with Spurs forward Tim Duncan. Duncan was ejected for laughing on the sidelines in a game against the Mavericks in the 2006‚Äì07 season. After a meeting between Crawford and the league office, the NBA decided to suspend Crawford for the remainder of the season and made him attend anger management courses. Accusations of network bias During its twelve-year run of covering the NBA, NBC Sports televised a substantial number of games featuring the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers. In the prime-time slot, from 5:30 p.m EST to 8:00 p.m EST, NBC aired games almost exclusively featuring New York City, Chicago or Los Angeles (incidentally, those three cities are the top three television markets in the United States, and have been historically the three most populous cities). Several fans and media analysts viewed this as favoritism, and fans of teams like the Houston Rockets who, despite being a large market (and Houston being the USA's fourth most populous city), being one of the best teams in the early-to-mid-1990s, winning the title in 1994 and 1995, and featuring a superstar in Hakeem Olajuwon, were not featured on NBC at the level of the other three teams, felt as if they were being snubbed. From to (NBC's run of covering the NBA), the Bulls, Lakers, and Knicks played in six, four and two NBA Finals respectively, every Finals featuring one or more of those teams except 1995, when the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic to win their second consecutive NBA championship. Until 1998, the Chicago Bulls were a dominant team, and during the early to mid-1990s, the New York Knicks were also in the NBA's elite. From 1997 to 2002, the Los Angeles Lakers also joined the ranks of the best in the NBA. New game ball After the 2005‚Äì06 season, David Stern announced that the league would use a new microfiber ball for the 2006‚Äì07 season. The microfiber ball replaced the previously used leather balls. The league claimed the new ball would provide better grip than the leather counterparts, especially when wet from player's sweat. Still the majority of players (notably Phoenix Suns point guard Steve Nash) expressed dislike for the new ball, saying among other things that it became slippery when wet, bounced awkwardly and gave players cuts. The largest complaint came from the fact that players had not been consulted before the new ball was put into play. The NBA Players Association filed an unfair labor practice lawsuit against the league because of that fact, subsequently dropping it after the league announced that it would revert to the leather balls starting on January 1, 2007. In a humorous move, the Washington Wizards played a video on the Verizon Center scoreboard welcoming back the \\"new old ball\\". Despite complaints, scoring and field goal percentage went up while the microfiber ball was used. Some individual players, however, including Chicago Bulls guard Ben Gordon and then Seattle SuperSonics guard Ray Allen, saw their usually high three-point shooting percentages decline. A more rigorous study found that while shooting percentages did in fact increase, so did turnover rates. In the aftermath, Commissioner Stern said that players would have more input on future decisions. Referee gambling scandal In July 2007, reports of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were made public, which alleged that during the 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07 NBA seasons, referee Tim Donaghy bet on games in which he officiated. On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation, and a year later he was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release. As a result, the general reaction by the media was that the NBA's popularity would be hurt by the news of this scandal. Gilbert Arenas/Javaris Crittenton gun incident On December 24, 2009, it was revealed that Gilbert Arenas of the Washington Wizards had admitted to storing unloaded firearms in his locker at Verizon Center and had surrendered them to team security. In doing so, Arenas not only violated NBA rules against bringing firearms into an arena, but also violated D.C. ordinances as well. On January 1, 2010, it was also reported that Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton had unloaded guns in the Wizards' locker room during a Christmas Eve argument regarding gambling debts. The D.C. Metropolitan Police and the U.S. Attorney's office began investigating, and on January 14, 2010, Arenas was charged with carrying a pistol without a license, a violation of Washington, D.C.'s gun-control laws.Howard Beck. \\"Wizards‚Äô Arenas Is Charged With Felony\\". New York Times. January 14, 2010. Retrieved on January 14, 2010. Arenas pleaded guilty on January 15 to the felony of carrying an unlicensed pistol outside a home or business. His sentencing hearing was scheduled for March 26. On January 6, 2010, the NBA suspended Arenas indefinitely without pay until its investigation was complete. NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a statement that \\"his ongoing conduct has led me to conclude that he is not currently fit to take the court in an NBA game.\\" By nearly all accounts, Stern felt compelled to act when Arenas' teammates surrounded him during pregame introductions prior to a game with the Philadelphia 76ers and he pretended to shoot them with guns made from his fingers. The Wizards issued a statement of their own condemning the players' pregame stunt as \\"unacceptable.\\" On January 27, 2010, Arenas and Crittenton were suspended for the rest of the season, after meeting with Stern. Both players would be removed from the team at the end of the season, with Crittenton being waived and Arenas being traded to the Orlando Magic. Crittenton would never play in the NBA again after that season (eventually being involved with a manslaughter case), while Arenas would be amnestied a year later before finishing his NBA career with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2012. 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests In early October 2019, the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey issued a tweet that supported the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. The NBA subsequently apologized in a statement saying the tweet was \\"regrettable\\". The perceived insufficiency of the NBA's defense of Morey's tweet and double standard relative to the league's history of political activism were criticized by US politicians and third-party observers;Some relevant sources include:        critics further compared the incident to an October 2 South Park episode \\"Band in China\\" which parodies the self-censorship of the American entertainment industry to meet Chinese censorship demands. The statement also drew criticism from mainland Chinese state-run media for the perceived insufficiency of the apology and led to the suspension/termination of all Mainland Chinese sponsors of the NBA. This led to both Republican and Democratic congresspeople, including Julian Castro, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz to make public statements criticizing both Chinese and NBA actions. NBA commissioner Adam Silver later defended league's response to the tweet, supporting Morey's right to freedom of expression while also accepting the right of reply from the government of and businesses from mainland China. An article by Fox Business said that the NBA would look to Africa and India for growth if the league were to sever ties with mainland China as a result of the tweet. 2020 Black Lives Matter protests Following a four-month hiatus the NBA resumed play in August 2020 at the Bubble held at Walt Disney World during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the build-up to the closed-door tournament, the death of George Floyd in May and the resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests during that time forced the hand of the NBA, a league looking to stand with its majority-Black player base. As a result, the league permitted players to wear league-approved messages on the back of their jerseys, and relaxed their long-standing position on not standing for the U.S. national anthem.https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/us/lebron-james-black-lives-matter-nba- spt-trnd/index.html The league also painted \\"BLACK LIVES MATTER\\" at center court for both of their venues for the tournament.https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/us/lebron-james-black-lives-matter- nba-spt-trnd/index.html Many critics, mostly conservative news media personalities and politicians such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, attacked the NBA for its public embracement of the movement. When Jonathan Isaac, an Orlando Magic player and a devout Evangelical Christian, both refused to kneel during the anthem in solidarity with his teammates or wear the team-approved \\"Black Lives Matter\\" t-shirt given to him,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/magics-jonathan-isaac-explains-why-he- didnt-take-knee-or-wear-black-lives-matter-shirt- friday/https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/08/jonathan-issac-national-anthem-kneel- black-lives-matter sales of his jersey rose in approval.https://www.fox13news.com/sports/magics-jonathan-isaac-jersey-sales- surge-after-he-stood-for-national-anthem-while-others- knelthttps://www.si.com/nba/cavaliers/nba-amico/jonathan-isaac-orlando-magic- knee-jersey On the other hand, San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovichhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/01/gregg-popovich- defends-standing-during-anthem-everybody-has-make-personal-decision/ and Miami Heat player Meyers Leonardhttps://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29579676/miami- heat-meyers-leonard-chooses-stand-national-anthem received criticism for doing the same, though they wore the \\"Black Lives Matter\\" tees while standing. NBA player walkout In response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, NBA players in the midst of their playoff anchored a wildcat strike in protest, setting off a chain reaction throughout North American sports where no professional games were played in any major league on August 26. While this did not receive major backlash as the earlier social- justice focused programs did, it represented a showing of player powerhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/business/economy/nba-players-strike- labor.html that many American sports fans have found themselves uncomfortable with, especially with regard to the NBA. The league and its players formed several initiatives in the wake of the walkout, the most notable of them being a pledge to turn several NBA venues into voting sites for the upcoming U.S. presidential election.http://www.nba.com/nba-arenas-polling-place-voting- center-2020-election 2020 NBA Finals ratings The record-low ratings for the 2020 NBA Finals, which saw the Los Angeles Lakers defeat the Miami Heat in six games, were widely panned by apolitical punditshttps://sports.yahoo.com/2020-nba-finals-ratings- historically-202732628.htmlhttps://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2020/10/nba- finals-ratings-record-lows-heat-lakers-abc/ and conservative criticshttps://nypost.com/2020/10/08/theres-no-salvaging-these-awful-nba- finals-ratings/https://www.outkick.com/nba-ratings-tank-game-2/, with myriad theories given as to why the ratings for the event dropped 65% from 2019. Most conservative critics, still engaging their audiences with relentless criticism of the NBA's social-justice initiatives, surmised that fans were disinterested in watching the league take such a politically polarizing stance (especially during the 2020 election)https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/02/is-politics- killing-the-nbas-ratings/. Others cited the league's struggles in the ratings as playing at an abnormal time of year, especially with the MLB postseason and the NFL regular season -- two traditional fall events -- undercutting casual fan interest, as opposed to the traditionally robust numbers the NBA's final gets in June.https://sports.yahoo.com/why-the-narrative-about-declining-nba- ratings-is-wrong-172402656.html Writing for Defector Media, Dan McQuade related modern criticism of the NBA's ratings to the same controversies the league has dealt with over the last 40 years: > The NBA has survived many supposed deaths. It was dying because the quality > of play was ‚Äúuninspired.‚Äù It was dying because of ‚Äúviewer alienation.‚Äù It > was dying because players of high school age were coming into too much money > too soon. It was dying because players didn‚Äôt wear suits. Now it‚Äôs dying > because the players dare to express their personal politics, which alienates > a certain type of viewer.

The village lies within the civil parish of Tring Rural, close to the boundary with Buckinghamshire. Wilstone reservoir, one of the four Tring reservoirs, lies close to the village.  History  It is believed by historians that Wilstone began under the name of Wyvellsthorn somewhere around the 6th century but there has been evidence that the area has been settled long before then as a Roman coin with the face of Publius Metilius Nepos, a Roman Governor of Britain from AD96 to AD98, has been found in the village and ancient pottery has been found near the reservoir. Wilstone has mostly remained the same over the past couple of centuries. Before the construction of the Grand Union Canal and Tring reservoirs Wilstone consisted mostly of a marsh in the south called 'the moors' and mills in the northern part of the village known as the milloppers. After the Moors drained into the Canals and reservoirs new land for workers to live became available and up to four pubs or ale houses, a chapel, a church, two or three shops, a forge and all the trades needed to support a village were constructed, however the only one of these 18th century developments to remain in their past form is The Half Moon, the local pub and the St. Cross church as the rest have been turned into houses because the invention of the automobile has made it possible for the villagers to travel to the surrounding towns for their services instead of using the inferior shops inside the village. In 1861 the villages population was recorded as around 455 however when a depression caused by international food trade and outbreaks of disease amongst workers hit the British agricultural industry the population declined. The village suffered heavily as workers conditions worsened and wages lowered further. This degradation of conditions caused the villages population to drop down to 400 as the workers moved to the city for a better life.http://www.stcross.nildram.co.uk/DGINTRO.html  The Witches Trial  In 1751 a horrific witch hunt took place in Wilstone and the surrounding villages. The series of events began in Gubblecote when an elderly couple from Long Marston were begging for money. After being turned away the mutterings of the women was mistaken for a curse and soon after the farmer fell ill and the two were believed to be a Wizard and a Witch. On 14 April a notice was posted in Leighton Buzzard, Hemel Hempstead and Winslow markets which read: \\" This is to give notice that on Munay next there is to be at Long Marcon in the Parish of Tring two ill desposed persons to be ducked by the neighbours consent\\". As time went on the people grew more hostile towards the Couple forcing them to flee to the Tring Workhouse for their own safety however this proved futile as a massive crowd possibly numbering around 4000 carried the couple away to Wilstone where they were dunked in a pond until death. The perpetrator named Colley, who had collected money from the mob because of the \\"enjoyment the ducking had provided\\", later paid for his actions as he was arrested, tried in Hertford then hung by chains in the Wilstone Green. More details of the Witch Hunt are at: http://www.wilstone.me.uk/page5.htm  Education  In 1838 on the 2nd year of Queen Victorias reign an act was passed to prompt the construction of more schools across England, Wilstone was selected as one of these locations and in 1848 the new school opened. The school was made up of one block and over its lifespan saw very little changes, the greatest change to the school being the transformation of the mud patch of a playground into a proper turfed area with an iron fence. The school saw 1,394 students cross its threshold with the students first entering the school when they were 2 years old and leaving when they were 12 years of age. During World War One and World War Two the school did its best to chip in and support the war efforts. In 1914-1918 the students collected 250 lbs of blackberries to add to the rations, In 1940 the school was pushed to max capacity as evacuees flooded the countryside from the cities currently under siege from the Luftwaffe and in 1948 the school was taken over by the Hertfordshire County Council from the Church of England and in 1956 School lunches were discontinued making the school into one of the very few in which students went home for lunch. In 1971 the school met its fate when it was shut down in favour of the modern school in Long Marston. The site remained empty until 1974 when it was turned into a block of flats.http://www.stcross.nildram.co.uk/DGSCHOOL.html  Religion  Wilstone has had a wide array of places of worship over the ages. The earliest acknowledgement of a chapel in Wilstone is an extract from a will which donates Four shillings and sixpence to the priest singing mass. This chapel was destroyed in Cromwell times when the structure was torn down and the materials were distributed to repair the villagers houses. The village lacked a chapel until 1837 when the Grange family erected a Baptist Chapel on New Road which has now been converted into semi-detached houses  St. Cross  In 1876 Wilstones new church started construction, possibly this was the first church in Wilstone in well over a century. Other than an extension in 2000 that added a new Wheelchair access ramp and entrance this Church has remained unchanging over the past 141 years. It holds around 2-3 services each month and hosts a bustling coffee morning between 10.30am and 12.00pm. The Church welcomes visitors and there is Tea and Coffee available. The \\"St\\" in St Cross translates to Sanctus which means that the churches name is \\"The Church of the Holy Cross\\".http://www.tringteamparish.org.uk/st-cross-wilstone/4589451989 References External links Category:Villages in Hertfordshire ","title":"Wilstone"},{"id":"7215135","text":"MKT Bridge from Boonville train depot on Katy Trail MKT Bridge from southeast The Missouri-Kansas-Texas Bridge (often called the \\"Katy Bridge\\" from MKT) is a former rail bridge across the Missouri River at Boonville, Missouri, where it connects Howard and Cooper counties. In 2010, the bridge was acquired by the city of Boonville from the Union Pacific Railroad. The city plans to incorporate it into the 225-mile Katy Trail bicycle trail. The bridge was built in 1931-32 as MKT Bridge No. 191.1 by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad to replace an 1873 MKT structure. It has four trusses over the water and a vertical lift in the middle, and was constructed by Kansas City Bridge Company (substructure), American Bridge Company (superstructure), and General Electric Company (electric installation). The rail line served by the bridge was acquired by Union Pacific Railroad, which later announced plans to abandon the line. In 1987, bicycle enthusiasts worked out an agreement to take use of the line for a rail trail administered by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and stretching from St. Charles to Clinton. The agreement stipulated that the trail would be operated as a railbank and according to the desires of the railroad. In 2004, the United States Coast Guard told Union Pacific that the unused bridge was a navigation hazard and should be dismantled. The railroad quietly began planning to float sections of the bridge to Jefferson City and use it as a new bridge across the Osage River. Bicycle enthusiasts caught wind of the move and launched a campaign to prevent it, fearing that if the bridge were torn down, the whole Katy Trail would have to be returned to adjoining property owners because it no longer was viable as a revitalized railroad. Under Governor Bob Holden, the state government announced plans to take over bridge maintenance, but in 2005, Governor Matt Blunt cancelled the plans because of the estimated $3 million to $11 million cost to convert the bridge for trail use. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon sued the Department of Natural Resources to enforce the original order permitting state takeover. On February 4, 2010, Nixon, newly elected governor, said the Union Pacific would transfer ownership of the bridge to the city of Boonville. City officials plan to rehab the bridge and incorporate it into the Katy Trail.

Truman High School is a public high school at 750 Baychester Avenue, in the Co-op City section of the Bronx, New York City, United States. The school is designated as an Empowerment School by the New York City Department of Education, which allows it more autonomy in choosing a curriculum. Truman shares a uniquely designed and interconnected campus with two middle schools, MS 180 and 181, and two elementary schools, PS 178 and 153. The campus was designed to be a one-stop and close-to-home solution for students and families in the Co-op City neighborhood, although many of the students commute to school from other parts of the city. The main Truman building is also home to the Bronx Health Sciences High School, which occupies a portion of the third floor, and PS 176X, a special education school for autistic students, which shares a small portion of the first and second floors. Truman High School is one of the remaining large high schools in the Bronx that has not been phased out and broken up into a number of small schools. This trend, which has been popular in the city, has seen other high schools in the borough, such as Evander Childs High School and Roosevelt High School closed and split into a number of smaller schools located in the same building. The school does, however, host Bronx Health Sciences High School created as part of the small schools movement, and previously hosted two additional high schools which have since moved to other locations. Truman High School and Bronx Health Sciences compose Harry S. Truman Educational Campus. History Closeup aerial view of Truman High School The site of Truman High School and the rest of Co-op City was originally home to the Freedomland amusement park. In the mid-1960s, when Co-op City was being constructed, the city proposed to construct a large high school in the development as well as Herbert H. Lehman High School and Adlai E. Stevenson High School in eastern Bronx, John F. Kennedy High School in western Bronx, South Shore High School in Brooklyn, and August Martin High School in Queens. Both Truman and Kennedy High Schools were planned as \\"educational parks\\", containing multiple schools in park settings, and integrating students from multiple areas and backgrounds to stave off de facto segregation within the school system. Truman's academic park was also called \\"Northeast Bronx Educational Park\\" or \\"East Bronx Educational Park\\", with a total of five schools planned in the complex to serve 10,400 students from both Co-op City and surrounding neighborhoods. The Northeast Bronx Park was funded by a grant as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and was to be the prototype for numerous academic parks in other parts of the city. The project was sponsored and developed by the United Housing Foundation and RiverBay Corporation, who also developed Co-op City. Construction on the complex began in 1969. During this time, a shopping center within the neighborhood was used as a temporary elementary school for local students. The first school completed within the park, PS 153, opened on September 13, 1971. The three remaining elementary and intermediate schools opened by September 1972. Truman High School opened on September 10, 1973, along with Beach Channel High School in Rockaway, Queens. The entire project cost $76 million. The completion of the athletic field was delayed due to the 1970s fiscal crisis. Soon after opening, the buildings of the complex were found to have numerous structural problems including leaks, cracking, and faulty utilities. The complex was boycotted by local residents in 1975 until repairs were made. The issues led New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan to audit the complex in late 1979. In 1998, Sana Q. Nasser became the principal of Truman. Under a partnership with the non-profit organization \\"P.E.N.C.I.L.\\",PENCIL: Transforming Schools Together she has created six small career-themed academies in TV Production/Media Communications, Culinary Arts, Air Force Junior ROTC, Engineering & Robotics, Law, and Business Computing. The academies serve to create and maintain the benefits and feeling of a small high school, with the variety of courses and extracurricular activities that can only be offered at a large high school. Students take their academy classes every day, for all four years of high school, and change academies (or enroll in more than one), if their schedule permits. Statistical analysis done by the school has indicated that among students who participate in the academies, on-time graduation rates are significantly higher, and overall attendance, behavior and academic performance in the core subject areas have improved.Bronx Principal Reinvents High School As part of the small schools movement championed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the Department of Education, three additional small high schools were opened within the Truman facility in September 2004: Bronx Health Sciences High School, East Bronx Academy for the Future, and Performance Conservatory High School (aka Bronx High School for Performance and Stagecraft). Truman was retained as a large high school. East Bronx Academy was moved to a new building in Crotona Park East in 2005, while Performance Conservatory is now part of the Herman Ridder Educational Campus and in the process of closing. Bronx Health Sciences High School is a public high school. The high school opened in 2004. Its principal is Miriam Rivas.

Truman High School. The three-section gymnasium appears at foreground. The Truman complex is located on the east side of Baychester Avenue and the New England Thruway in western Co-op City, between sections 1 and 3 of the development. Truman High School sits at the center of the complex, circumscribed by the other four schools and the Truman gymnasium. The high school is seven stories high with a basement, designed for 4,000 students. The school's gymnasium building is located immediately east of the high school, featuring several dance studios, a wrestling gym, weight room, aerobics facility and a large gymnasium which can be separated into three smaller gyms. Outside at the east end of the complex, the school hosts an multi-purpose grass field for football and baseball surrounded by a six-lane track and field competition area, along with five tennis courts and handball courts. The school's auditorium spans nearly three stories of the building vertically, and has two tiers of audience seating. The auditorium is shared with the connecting middle and elementary schools. Students can access it using tunnels that connect the five separate buildings. When it was built, the school housed two indoor swimming pools. An Olympic-sized competition pool, which had been closed since 1995 due to eroded pipes was reopened in January 2012. An adjacent shallow training pool, also in disrepair, was not fixed due to a lack of sufficient funds. It is now hidden from view behind a wall built during the renovation.Harry S Truman's Pools Stay Closed in BaychesterInsideschools.org Review of Truman High School Renovated Pool area at Harry S.

These are important open topics in particle physics. EXO currently has a 200-kilogram xenon liquid time projection chamber (EXO-200) with R&D; efforts on a ton-scale experiment (nEXO). Xenon double beta decay was detected and limits have been set for 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤.  Overview  EXO measures the rate of neutrinoless decay events above the expected background of similar signals, to find or limit the double beta decay half-life, which relates to the effective neutrino mass using nuclear matrix elements. A limit on effective neutrino mass below 0.01 eV would determine the neutrino mass order. The effective neutrino mass is dependent on the lightest neutrino mass in such a way that that bound indicates the normal mass hierarchy.See P. Vogel, A. Piepke (2007). \\"Neutrinoless Double-beta decay\\", in The expected rate of 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ events is very low, so background radiation is a significant problem. WIPP has of rock overburden‚Äîequivalent to of water‚Äîto screen incoming cosmic rays. Lead shielding and a cryostat also protect the setup. The neutrinoless decays would appear as narrow spike in the energy spectrum around the xenon Q-value (QŒ≤Œ≤ = 2457.8 keV), which is fairly high and above most gamma decays.  EXO-200   History  EXO-200 was designed with a goal of less than 40 events per year within two standard deviations of expected decay energy. This background was achieved by selecting and screening all materials for radiopurity. Originally the vessel was to be made of Teflon, but the final design of the vessel uses thin, ultra-pure copper. EXO-200 was relocated from Stanford to WIPP in the summer of 2007. Assembly and commissioning continued until the end of 2009 with data taking beginning in May 2011. Calibration was done using 228Th, 137Cs, and 60Co gamma sources.  Design  The prototype EXO-200 uses a copper cylindrical time projection chamber filled with of pure liquid xenon. Xenon is a scintillator, so decay particles produce prompt light which is detected by avalanche photodiodes, providing the event time. A large electric field drives ionization electrons to wires for collection. The time between the light and first collection determines the z coordinate of the event, while a grid of wires determines the radial and angular coordinates. Image:EXO cryostat.jpg|The EXO-200 cryostat installed underground at WIPP. Image:EXO underground laboratory.JPG|The EXO-200 cleanrooms installed underground at WIPP.  Results  The background from earth radioactivity(Th/U) and 137Xe contamination led to ‚âà2√ó10‚àí3 counts/(keV¬∑kg¬∑yr) in the detector. Energy resolution near QŒ≤Œ≤ of 1.53% was achieved. In August 2011, EXO-200 was the first experiment to observe double beta decay of 136Xe, with a half life of 2.11√ó1021 years. This is the slowest directly observed process. An improved half life of 2.165 ¬±0.016(stat) ¬±0.059(sys) √ó 1021 years was published in 2014. EXO set a limit on neutrinoless beta decay of 1.6√ó1025 years in 2012. A revised analysis of run 2 data with 100 kg¬∑yr exposure, reported in the June issue of Nature reduced the limits on half-life to 1.1√ó1025 yr, and mass to 450 meV. This was used to confirm the power of the design and validate the proposed expansion. Additional running for two years is expected. As of 2018, the EXO-200 has performed two scientific operations, Phase I (2011-2014) and after upgrades, Phase II (2016-planned end December 2018). No evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay has been found in the combined Phase I and II data, giving the lower bound of 1.8 \\\\cdot 10^{25} years for the half-life. Phase II will be the final operation of EXO-200.  nEXO  A ton-scale experiment, nEXO (\\"next EXO\\"), must overcome many backgrounds. The EXO collaboration is exploring many possibilities to do so, including barium tagging in liquid xenon. Any double beta decay event will leave behind a daughter barium ion, while backgrounds, such as radioactive impurities or neutrons, will not. Requiring a barium ion at the location of an event eliminates all backgrounds. Tagging of a single ion of barium has been demonstrated and progress has been made on a method for extracting ions out of the liquid xenon. A freezing probe method has been demonstrated, and gaseous tagging is also being developed. The 2014 EXO-200 paper indicated a 5000 kg TPC can improve the background by xenon self-shielding and better electronics. Diameter would be increased to 130 cm and a water tank would be added as shielding and muon veto. This is much larger than the attenuation length for gamma rays. Radiopure copper for nEXO has been completed. It is planned for installation in the SNOLAB \\"Cryopit\\". Video available at . An Oct. 2017 paper details the experiment and discusses the sensitivity and the discovery potential of nEXO for neutrinoless double beta decay. LLNL-JRNL-737682 Details on the ionization readout of the TPC have also been published. The pre- Conceptual Design Report (pCDR) for nEXO was published in 2018. The planned location is SNOLAB, Canada.

In 381, after many decades of formulating the doctrine of the Trinity, the First Council of Constantinople condemned Arianism. Subordinationism has common characteristics with Arianism. In various forms it thrived at the same time as Arianism, and long survived Arianism. Its chief proponents in the 4th century were Arius of Alexandria, with whom the view is most commonly associated, and Eusebius of Nicomedia.

He is perhaps the most clear in his language defining the relationships between the Father and the Son. \\"...the Father himself is alone called God...the Scriptures acknowledge him alone as God; and yet again...the Lord confesses him alone as his own Father, and knows no other.\\"Irenaeus Against Heresies Book II, 6 (ANF 1:). \\" . . this is sure and steadfast, that no other God or Lord was announced by the Spirit, except him who, as God, rules over all, together with his Word, and those who receive the spirit of adoption, that is, those who believe in the one and true God, and in Jesus Christ the Son of God; and likewise that the apostles did of themselves term no one else God, or name no other as Lord; and, what is much more important, since it is true that our Lord acted likewise, who did also command us to confess no one as Father, except he who is in the heavens, who is the one God and the one Father.\\"Irenaeus Against Heresies Book VI, 6 (ANF 1:). \\"This, therefore, having been clearly demonstrated here (and it shall yet be so still more clearly), that neither the prophets, nor the apostles, nor the Lord Christ in His own person, did acknowledge any other Lord or God, but the God and Lord supreme: the prophets and the apostles confessing the Father and the Son; but naming no other as God, and confessing no other as Lord: and the Lord Himself handing down to His disciples, that He, the Father, is the only God and Lord, who alone is God and ruler of all;\\" Irenaeus Against Heresies Book III, 6 (ANF 1:). Irenaeus also refers to John \\"...proclaiming one God, the Almighty, and one Jesus Christ, the only- begotten, by whom all things were made.\\" Irenaeus Against Heresies Book I, 6 (ANF 1:). * Origen taught that Jesus was ' (secondary god),Origen Against Celsus, 5.39 (PG 14:108-110; ANF 4:). a notion borrowed from Hellenistic philosophy. He also said the Son was \\"distinct\\" from the Father.Prestige xxvii Finally Origen insisted that the Son, though eternal, is other in substance than the Father, and is lesser in power.Origen On Prayer, 15:1; Origen Against Celsus, 8.12 (ANF 4:). It should be noticed that some of these same references are used to defend the concept of the Trinity. However, subordinationism is not a differentiation or distinction between persons in the Trinity. In this regard they agree. Subordinationism rather suggests that the Son (and Spirit) are other in substance than the Father. * Clement of Rome (composed late 1st or early 2nd century): \\"The apostles received the gospel for us from Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ was sent from God. So Christ is from God, and the apostles are from Christ: thus both came in proper order by the will of God.\\"Clement of Rome First Letter to the Corinthians, 42:1-2 (ANF 1:). * Ignatius of Antioch (50-115): \\"Jesus Christ ... is the expressed purpose of the Father, just as the bishops who have been appointed throughout the world exist by the purpose of Jesus Christ.\\"Ignatius of Antioch Letter to the Ephesians, 3. \\"Be subject to the bishop and to one another, as Jesus Christ in the flesh was subject to the Father and the apostles were subject to Christ and the Father, so that there may be unity both fleshly and spiritual.\\"Ignatius of Antioch Letter to the Magnesians, 13 \\"All of you are to follow the bishop as Jesus Christ follows the Father, and the presbytery [the elders] as the apostles.\\"Ignatius of Antioch Letter to the Smyrnaeans, 8. * Epistle of Barnabas (): \\" if the Lord endured to suffer for our soul, He being Lord of all the world, to whom God said at the foundation of the world, 'Let us make man after our image, and after our likeness,' \\"Epistle of Barnabas 5:5 (ANF 1:) \\"For the Scripture says concerning us, while He speaks to the Son, 'Let Us make man after Our image, and after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the sea.' And the Lord said, on beholding the fair creature man, 'Increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth.' These things [were spoken] to the Son.\\"Epistle of Barnabas 6:12-13 (ANF 1:). * Justin Martyr (100-165) : \\"I shall attempt to persuade you, that there is, and that there is said to be, another God and Lord subject to the Maker of all things; who is also called an Angel, because He announces to men whatsoever the Maker of all things wishes to announce to them.\\"Justin Martyr Dialogue with Trypho, 56 (ANF 1:). \\"But to the Father of all, who is unbegotten, there is no name given. And His Son, the Word, who also was with Him and was begotten before the works, when at first He created and arranged all things by Him, is called Christ, in reference to His being anointed and God's ordering all things through Him; But 'Jesus', His name as man and Saviour, has significance. For He was made man having been conceived according to the will of God the Father.\\"Justin Martyr Dialogue with Trypho, 6 (ANF 1:). * Didache (): \\"We thank you, our Father, for the holy vine of David your servant, which you have made known unto us through Jesus your Servant.\\"Didache, 9:1, Sparks ed. \\"We thank you, our Father, for the life and knowledge, which you have made known to us through Jesus your Servant. Glory to you forever!\\"Didache, 9:3, Sparks ed. * Tertullian (AD 165-225): professed that the Father, Son, and Spirit \\"are inseparable from each other.\\" His \\"assertion is that the Father is one, and the Son one, and the Spirit one, and that They are distinct from Each Other. This statement,\\" according to Tertullian, \\"is taken in a wrong sense by every uneducated as well as every perversely disposed person, as if it predicated a separation among the Father, Son, and Spirit.\\" Tertullian said \\"it is not by diversity that the Son differs from the Father, but by distribution: it is not by division but by distinction; they differ one from the other in the mode of their being. For the Father is the entire substance, but the Son is a derivation and portion of the whole, Thus the Father is distinct from the Son, being greater than the Son, inasmuch as He who begets is one, and He who is begotten is another; He who sends is one, and He who is sent is another; and He who makes is one, and He through whom the thing is made is another.\\" Moreover, \\"their names represent what they are called; and the distinction indicated by the names does not admit confusion, because there is none in the things which they designate.\\"Tertullian Against Praxeas, 9 (ANF 3:). * Pope Dionysius (composed 265): \\"Neither, then, may we divide into three godheads the wonderful and divine unity.... Rather, we must believe in God, the Father Almighty; and in Christ Jesus, his Son; and in the Holy Spirit; and that the Word is united to the God of the universe. 'For,' he says, 'The Father and I are one,' and 'I am in the Father, and the Father in me'.\\"Dionysius of Rome Letter to Dionysius of Alexandria, 1. Excerpt in Yet, Jesus is not treated as synonymous with God the Father. First Council of Nicaea Bishop Alexander, of Alexandria, taught that Christ was the Divine Son of God, who was equal to the Father by nature, and in no way inferior to him, sharing the Father's divine nature. However, Presbyter Arius believed this was inconsistent with the recent decisions against Sabellius at the Synod of Rome. Arius opposed Alexander and called him a heretic. At subsequent local synods, Alexander's view was upheld, and Arius was condemned and excommunicated as a heretic. Arius' friendship with powerful allies, especially Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was influential in Constantine's Imperial Court, led to the controversy being brought before Constantine. Constantine at first viewed the controversy as trivial and insisted that they settle their dispute quietly and peacefully. When it became clear that a peaceful solution was not forthcoming, Constantine summoned all Christian bishops to convene the first ecumenical council (Nicaea I) at Nicaea. From the beginning of the Arian controversy, due to the influence of Arian bishops like Eusebius of Nicomedia, Constantine initially favored the Arian position. He saw their views as being easier for the common Roman to understand, and easier for Roman pagans to accept and convert to. Two vocal subordinationists were Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia. Of these, Eusebius of Caesarea was more moderate in his subordinationist views. Although not as extreme as the Arians in his definition of who Jesus is, he disagreed with the Modalists in equating Jesus with his Father in authority or person but he was flexible concerning ousia (substance). The Trinitarians also opposed Modalism, but insisted on the equality of the Son and the Father by nature (though they generally allowed that the Son was relationally subordinate to the Father as to his authority). For the reasons of him being moderate in the religious and political spectrum of beliefs, Constantine I turned to Eusebius of Caesarea to try to make peace between the Arians and the Trinitarians at Nicaea I.On the so-called ‚ÄòArians‚Äô of the fourth century see Hanson, The Search, 3-59, 557-638, Ayres, Nicea, 105-132, and, D. Gwynn, The Eusebians: The Polemic of Athanasius of Alexandria and the Construction of the Arian Heresy (Oxford: OUP, 2007). Eusebius of Caesarea wrote, in On the Theology of the Church, that the Nicene Creed is a full expression of Christian theology, which begins with: \\"We believe in One God...\\" Eusebius goes on to explain how initially the goal was not to expel Arius and his supporters, but to find a Creed on which all of them could agree and unite. The Arians, led by Arius and Eusebius of Nicomedia, insisted that the Son was \\"heteroousios\\" or \\"of a different substance/nature\\" from the Father. The Trinitarians, led by Alexander, his protege Athanasius, and Hosius of Cordoba insisted that the Arian view was heretical and unacceptable. Eusebius of Caesarea suggested a compromise wording of a creed, in which the Son would be affirmed as \\"homoiousios\\", or \\"of similar substance/nature\\" with the Father. But Alexander and Athanasius saw that this compromise would allow the Arians to continue to teach their heresy, but stay technically within orthodoxy, and therefore rejected that wording. Hosius of Cordova suggested the term \\"homoousios\\" or \\"of the same substance/nature\\" with the Father. This term was found to be acceptable, though it meant the exclusion of the Arians. But it united most of those in attendance at Nicaea I. Even the \\"semi-Arians\\" such as Eusebius of Caesarea accepted the term and signed the Nicene Creed. Constantine, though he initially backed the Arians, supported the decision of the Council in order to unify the Church and his Empire. He ordered that any bishop, including his friend Eusebius of Nicomedia, who refused to sign the Creed should be removed from their positions in the Church and exiled from the Empire. Post-Nicean Athanasius, while believing in the Monarchy of God the Father in which the Father is the source of the Son, rejected Arian subordinationism. Constantine, who had been sympathetic to the Arian view from the beginning of the controversy, ends up rescinding the exiles of Arius and his supporters only a few short years after Nicea. He also brings Eusebius of Nicomedia in as his personal spiritual advisor, and then turned on Athanasius, who is not only deposed from his seat as bishop of Alexandria, but also banished from the Roman Empire a total of five different times. After the death of Constantine, his sons, Constans I and Constantius II, share joint rule in the Empire. Both sons begin to actively support the subordinationist views of Arianism, and begin to depose Trinitarian bishops in key sees throughout the empire and replace them with Arian bishops. This policy begins to change the balance of power in the Christian Church, as many of the most influential churches in the empire became Arian by the intervention of Constans I and Constantius II.Socrates Scholasticus Church History, 2.37 (NPNF2 2:). To this, Saint Jerome lamented about the creed of the Synod of Ariminum: \\"The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian.\\"Jerome Dialogue against the Luciferians, 19 (NPNF2 6:). Ironically, after Nicaea I, Arianism actually grew in power in the Church. The deaths of Constans I and Constantius II ended this policy, however the increased power of Arianism in the Church remained unchanged until the ascension of an Emperor friendly to the Trinitarian view. Theodosius I called the second ecumenical council, Constantinople I, in 381, 56 years after Nicaea I, to confront the Arian controversy.Socrates Scholasticus Church History, 5.8 (NPNF2 2:), 5.11 (NPNF2 2:). Constantinople I once again rejected Arian subordinationism, and affirmed Trinitarianism. In addition, the Nicene Creed of 325 was amended and expanded to include a more detailed statement about the Holy Spirit, rejecting an idea which had been advanced by the Arians during the intervening years since Nicea, termed \\"Macedonianism\\", which denied the full deity of the Holy Spirit. The Creed of 381http://oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox- faith/doctrine/the-symbol-of-faith/nicene-creed included an affirmation of the full deity of the Holy Spirit, calling him \\"the Lord, the giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father.\\"Tanner, Norman; Alberigo, Giuseppe, eds. (1990). Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press. p. 84. Cappadocian Fathers achieved final victory against Arian Subordinationism by refuting the various later versions of Arianism. Like all catholic theologians they also believed in the Monarchy of God the Father, which they interpreted as denying the subordination of the essence of the Son and Holy Spirit. (The Greek Fathers and the whole Christian Orient speak, in this regard, of the \\"Father's Monarchy,\\" and the Western tradition, following Augustine of Hippo, also confesses that the Holy Spirit originates from the Father ', that is, as principle.Augustine of Hippo. De Trinitate XV, 25, 47 (PL 42:1094-1095). In this sense, therefore, the two traditions recognize that the \\"monarchy of the Father\\" implies that the Father is the sole Trinitarian Cause (Aitia) or Principle (') of the Son and the Holy Spirit.) The origin of the Holy Spirit from the Father alone as Principle of the whole Trinity is called ' by Greek tradition, following the Cappadocian Fathers. St. Gregory of Nazianzus, the Theologian, in fact, characterizes the Spirit's relationship of origin from the Father by the proper term ekporeusis, distinguishing it from that of procession (to proienai) which the Spirit has in common with the Son. \\"The Spirit is truly the Spirit proceeding (proion) from the Father, not by filiation, for it is not by generation, but by ekporeusis.\\" Discourse 39, 12 (Sources chretiennes 358, p. 175) c.f. Commentary on St. John, X, 2, (PG 74:910D); Ep 55, (PG 77:316D), etc. Even for Cyril, the term ' as distinct from the term \\"proceed\\" (proienai), can only characterize a relationship of origin to the principle without principle of the Trinity: the Father. In 589, battling a resurgence of Arianism, the Third Council of Toledo, in the Kingdom of Toledo, added the term ' (\\"and the Son\\") to the Nicene Creed. This was ostensibly to counter the Arian argument that the Son was inferior to the Father because he did not share in the Father's role as the Source of the Holy Spirit's Godhead, and so they affirmed that the Holy Spirit proceeded \\"from the Father and the Son\\". This, phrase, however, was not intended originally to change the Nicene Creed, but only used as a local creed in defense against the Arians. But its use began to spread throughout the Western Church. To many in the Eastern Church, the filioque implied that there were two sources of the Godhead, the Father and the Son, which to them meant that there were now two Gods, and the Holy Spirit was relegated to an inferior status, as the only member of the Godhead who was not the source of any other. The Western Churches, however, did not necessarily understand this clause to imply this, but understood it to mean the Holy Spirit proceeded \\"from the Father through the Son\\" or \\"From the Father and the Son as from one principle our source\\".Davies, Rupert Eric (1987-07-01). Making sense of the creeds. Epworth. . Retrieved 2013-03-14. But to the Eastern Church, it appeared to be a denial of the Monarchy of the Father and an heretical and unauthorized change of the Nicene Faith. In the Eastern Church, the debate surrounding subordinationism was submerged into the later conflict over Monarchianism, or single-source of divinity. This idea was that the Father was the source of divinity, from whom the Son is eternally begotten and the Spirit proceeds. As the Western church seemed to implicitly deny the monarchy of the Father and explicitly assert the papacy. Disagreements about the filioque and papal primacy eventually contributed to the East-West Schism of 1054.  Sixteenth-century Reformed  In his Institutes of the Christian Religion, book 1, chapter 13 Calvin attacks those in the Reformation family who while they confess ‚Äòthat there are three [divine] persons‚Äô speak of the Father as ‚Äòthe essence giver‚Äô as if he were ‚Äòtruly and properly the sole God‚Äô. This he says, ‚Äòdefinitely cast[s] the Son down from his rank.‚Äô This is because it implies that the Father is God in a way the Son is not. Modern scholars are agreed that this was a sixteenth century form of what today is called, ‚Äòsubordinationism‚Äô. Richard Muller says Calvin recognised that what his opponents were teaching ‚Äòamounted to a radical subordination of the second and third persons, with the result that the Father alone is truly God.‚Äô Ellis adds that this teaching also implied tritheism, three separate Gods.  Seventeenth-century Arminianism  Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609), in contrast to Calvin, argued that the begetting of the Son should be understood as the generation of the person of the Son and therefore the attribute of self-existence, or aseitas, belonged to the Father alone. His disciple, Simon Bischop (1583-1643), who assumed the name Episcopius, went further speaking openly and repeatedly of the subordination of the Son. He wrote, ‚ÄòIt is certain from these same scriptures that to these people‚Äôs divinity and divine perfections [the Son and the Spirit] are attributed, but not collaterally or co-ordinately, but subordinately.‚Äô Ellis says: ‚ÄòHis discussion of the importance of recognizing subordination among the persons takes up nearly half of the chapter on the Trinity, and the following four chapters are largely taken up with the implications of this subordination.‚Äô In seventeenth century England Arminian subordinationism gained wide support from leading English divines, including, Bishop John Bull (1634-1710), Bishop John Pearson (1683-1689) and Samuel Clarke (1675-1729), one of the most learned biblical scholars of his day. Current views Eastern Orthodox According to the Eastern Orthodox view, the Son is derived from the Father who alone is without cause or origin. This is not subordinationism, and the same doctrine is asserted by western theologians such as Augustine. In this view, the Son is co-eternal with the Father or even in terms of the co-equal uncreated nature shared by the Father and Son. However, this view is sometimes misunderstood as a form of subordinationism by Western Christians, who also asserts the same view even when not using the technical term i.e. Monarchy of the Father. Western view is often viewed by the Eastern Church as being close to Modalism. Catholics The Catholic church also believes that the Son is begotten of the Father and the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through / and from the Son. Catholic theologian John Hardon wrote that subordinationism \\"denies that the second and third persons are consubstantial with the Father. Therefore it denies their true divinity.\\" Arius \\"made a formal heresy of\\" subordinationism. The International Theological Commission wrote that \\"many Christian theologians borrowed from Hellenism the notion of a secondary god ('), or of an intermediate god, or even of a demiurge.\\" Subordinationism was \\"latent in some of the Apologists and in Origen.\\" The Son was, for Arius, in \\"an intermediate position between the Father and the creatures.\\" Nicaea I \\"defined that the Son is consubstantial (') with the Father. In so doing, the Church both repudiated the Arian compromise with Hellenism and deeply altered the shape of Greek, especially Platonist and neo- Platonist, metaphysics. In a manner of speaking, it demythicized Hellenism and effected a Christian purification of it. In the act of dismissing the notion of an intermediate being, the Church recognized only two modes of being: uncreated (nonmade) and created.\\" Lutherans Subordinationism in yet another form gained support from a number of Lutheran theologians in Germany in the nineteenth century. Stockhardt, writing in opposition, says the well- known theologians Thomasius, Frank, Delitsch, Martensen, von Hoffman and Zoeckler all argued that the Father is God in the primary sense, and the Son and the Spirit are God in second and third degree. He criticises most sharply the Leipzig theologian, Karl Friedrich Augustus Kahnis (1814-1888). For these Lutheran theologians, God was God, Jesus Christ was God in some lesser way. The American Lutheran theologian, F. Pieper (1852-1931), argues that behind this teaching lay an acceptance of ‚Äòmodernism‚Äô, or what we would call today, theological ‚Äòliberalism‚Äô. More recently John Kleinig, of Australian Lutheran College, promoted a form of subordinationism and concluded: Evangelicals Contemporary Evangelicals believe the historically agreed fundamentals of the Christian faith, including the Trinity. In the typical Evangelical formula, the Trinity is one God in three equal persons, among whom there is \\"economic subordination\\" (as, for example, when the Son obeys the Father). As recently as 1977, the concept of economic subordinationism has been advanced in evangelical circles. In The New Testament teaching on the role relationship of men and women, Presbyterian minister George W. Knight III wrote that the Son is functionally ‚Äì but not ontologically ‚Äì subordinate to the Father, thus positing that eternal functional subordination does not necessarily imply ontological subordination. Nontrinitarians  Nontrinitarianism is a form of Christianity that rejects the mainstream Christian doctrine of the Trinity‚Äîthe teaching that God is three distinct hypostases or persons who are coeternal, coequal, and indivisibly united in one being, or essence (from the Greek ousia). Certain religious groups that emerged during the Protestant Reformation have historically been known as antitrinitarian. In number of adherents, nontrinitarian denominations comprise a small minority of modern Christianity. The three that are by far the largest are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (\\"Mormons\\"), Jehovah's Witnesses and the Iglesia ni Cristo, though there are a number of other smaller groups. Scholars Oxford Encyclopedia ‚ÄòSubordinationism. Thus we call the tendency, strong in the 2nd- and 3rd-century theology, to consider Christ, as Son of God, inferior to the Father. Behind this tendency were gospel statements in which Christ himself stressed this inferiority (; Mk 10, 18; 13, 32, etc.) and it was developed in Logos christology. This theology, partly under the influence of middle platonism, considered Christ, logos and divine wisdom, as the means of liaison and mediation between the Father's position to him. When the conception of the Trinity was enlarged to include the Holy Spirit, as in Origen, this in turn was considered inferior to the Son. Subordinationist tendencies are evident in theologians like Justin, Tertullian, Origen, and Novatian; but even in Irenaeus, to whom trinitarian speculations are alien, commenting on , has no difficulty in considering Christ inferior to the Father.‚Äô Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church Subordinationism, according to Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, \\"regards either the Son as subordinate to the Father or the Holy Spirit as subordinate to both. It is a characteristic tendency in much Christian teaching of the first three centuries, and is a marked feature of such otherwise orthodox Fathers as\\" Justin Martyr and Irenaeus. Reasons for this tendency include: *\\"the stress on the absolute unity and transcendence of God the Father, which is common to all forms of theology using the existing categories of Greek thought *\\"the fear of compromising monotheism *\\"the implications of one strand of biblical teaching\\" represented by ‚Äù By the 4th century, subordinationism was \\"regarded as clearly heretical in its denial of the co-equality of the Three Persons of the Trinity. The issue was most explicitly dealt with in the conflict with Arius and his followers, who held that the Son was God not by nature but by grace and was created by the Father, though in a creation outside time.\\" Subordination of the Holy Spirit became more prominent in the 4th century Pneumatomachi. The second ecumenical council, Constantinople I, condemned subordinationism in 381. The Westminster Handbook to Patristic Theology Kevin Giles Mark Baddeley has criticized Giles for what he sees as a conflation of ontological and relational subordinationism, and for his supposed generalisation that \\"the ante-Nicene Fathers were subordinationists\\" See also * Adoptionism * Binitarianism * Christology * Semi-Arianism * Unitarianism References Category:Christian terminology Category:Christology Category:Nontrinitarianism ","title":"Subordinationism"},{"id":"7215378","text":"A cooked sausage and pepperoni Tombstone pizza Tombstone is a brand of frozen pizza. It is available with a variety of toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, onions, bell peppers, and sausage. The package design typically includes images of a cactus and the pizza. History Tombstone originally wanted to set up in Rib Lake, Wisconsin, but the village board of Rib lake didn't think it would take off so they set up in Medford, Wisconsin, United States. Tombstone was founded in Medford, Wisconsin, United States, by Pep Simek, his brother, Ron Simek, and two other individuals in 1962. The name came from The Tombstone Tap, a tavern owned by the Simeks which was located across from a cemetery, hence its name. In 1988, the Tombstone Pizza Company became a wholly owned but \\"freestanding\\" division of Kraft Foods. The employees who worked for Tombstone at the time were allowed to keep their jobs, although Pep and Ron Simek stepped aside from their roles in the business. On January 5, 2010, Kraft Foods announced it was selling its frozen pizza division to Switzerland-based Nestl√© Foods as part of a plan to use the proceeds to purchase Cadbury, a maker of dairy milk chocolate. In addition to Tombstone, this included other pizza brands including DiGiorno, Jacks and California Pizza Kitchen's frozen pizza line. The Kraft frozen pizza division is now part of Nestl√© D.S.D. (direct store delivery). Slogan \\"What do you want on your Tombstone?\\" was created by the Chicago office of advertising agency Foote, Cone & Belding, now part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The slogan was typically used in Western advertising campaigns: a typical television commercial would ostensibly appear to be a public execution, but when the supposed executioner would ask \\"what do you want on your tombstone?\\" (i.e. an epitaph), the accused would reply along the lines of \\"Pepperoni and cheese.\\" A Tombstone pizza would then be summoned. Another slogan used in 1999 and the early 2000s was \\"Shoulda had that Tombstone.\\" In one of the television commercials, the growling of a boy's stomach caused him to be caught by his girlfriend's father while hiding in her room.

It is the fifth novel to feature Investigator Arkady Renko and the first one taking place in Russia during the new, independent (post-Soviet) era.Wroe, Nicholas, The Guardian (March 26, 2005). Crime PaysPetit, Chris, The Guardian (April 2, 2005). Dead zone Plot Russia has changed from a Communist to capitalist state, and Ukraine has seceded from the former Soviet Union. When Pavel \\"Pasha\\" Ivanov, one of the leading members of Russia's new billionaire class, dies in an apparent suicide, Renko investigates. Pasha fell from the balcony of his penthouse apartment, and all the signs point to his having been alone at the time. The only anomaly is a large mound of table salt in the victim's wardrobe. Despite interference from his own boss as well as from other persons of power, Renko continues his investigation by questioning Pasha's friends and associates. There is apparently some kind of dark secret in Ivanov's past, and Pasha was always very depressed around May Day. Just before he is forcefully removed from the investigation, Arkady returns alone to Pasha's apartment and reconstructs his movements on the night he died. In the drawer of his bureau, Arkady finds a radiation dosimeter wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief. Turning it on, he finds that the entire apartment is radioactive, the highest levels coming from the mound of salt. Arkady concludes that Ivanov did indeed commit suicide but that it was under a form of duress. A HazMat team re-examines the apartment and Pasha's body and finds that the salt was mixed with a small quantity of cesium chloride, identical in appearance to table salt but lethally radioactive. After confirming that his apartment was filled with radiation, Ivanov swallowed a large quantity of the salt before jumping, in an attempt to protect anyone entering the apartment later. A week after Arkady's discovery, Pasha's business partner Timofeyev is found murdered near Pripyat, Ukraine, in the \\"dead zone\\" around the site of the Chernobyl disaster. Arkady's superior, exasperated at his insubordination, posts him to Ukraine to \\"investigate\\" this murder with neither assistance nor resources. He makes the acquaintance of the colorful local community: a team of radiobiologists, various foreign scientists, and a small group of peasant squatters who refuse to leave the area despite the official evacuation. Arkady also becomes the lover of Eva Kazka, a medical doctor assigned to the scientific community. Eva confides to him that she was rendered infertile and also suffered a long series of operable cancers as a result of exposure to radioactive fallout that blanketed Kiev while she was marching in a May Day parade after the meltdown. Eva's ex- husband, Alex Gerasimov, the leader of the radiobiology team, kidnaps Arkady and reveals himself to be the culprit, explaining his motives with relish: Ivanov and Timofeyev were the favorite pupils of Alex's father, Felix Gerasimov, the Soviet Union's leading authority on nuclear accidents. When the Central Committee telephoned Gerasimov to ask what to do about the meltdown, Gerasimov was too drunk to respond, so Ivanov and Timofeyev took the call, pretending to be relaying Gerasimov's instructions. Based on what the Committee told them, Ivanov and Timofeyev decided that it was unnecessary to either evacuate Pripyat or to cancel the May Day celebrations in Kiev. In other words, Ivanov and Timofeyev were ambitious men who reacted to a crisis the way ambitious men do: by covering up for their boss, and by telling the men in charge what they want to hear - and by doing so, they allowed millions of civilians (including Eva) to be exposed to the fallout. Gerasimov remained untouched by the scandal but later committed suicide. While Alex admits that Ivanov and Timofeyev were not solely responsible for the disaster, he felt they should be held accountable to some degree. He planted tiny grains of cesium on their clothes and persons, tormenting them before administering fatal doses. He even offered to stop if Ivanov and Timofeyev would return to Chernobyl and admit their responsibility, but \\"they were too ashamed to save their own lives.\\" After Ivanov's death, Timofeyev tried to save himself by returning to the scene of his crime, though Alex says he doesn't know who murdered him. Having killed his assistants in cold blood, Alex prepares to kill Arkady to cover his tracks when he is shot down by the vengeful sister of one of the assistants. Arkady reports that Pasha's case has been solved, though the murders of Timofeyev and Alex Gerasimov remain open. He is recalled to Moscow. Eva leaves with him, and the couple adopt an orphaned boy named Zhenya whom Arkady has been mentoring at a local shelter. A few months later, they make a one-day trip back to Pripyat to visit some of their local friends, an elderly farmer couple who have lived in the same place all their lives, and whose grandchildren died from radiation poisoning. Seeing the husband, Roman, slaughter a pig in almost exactly the same way as Timofeyev was killed, Arkady and Eva realize that it was Roman who killed Timofeyev, and why, but refrain from reporting it to the authorities. Explanation of the title There are a number of possible interpretations of the title: *Wolves are said to attack domesticated canines out of the sentiment that the dogs have betrayed their own species by living with and depending on humans for their survival. The contemptible dogs have unforgivingly traded their priceless freedom for food, security and other creature comforts. *The murderer, when revealed, describes himself as a wolf, not so much for any violence or viciousness in his character, but because he considers himself a true predator: attacking his victims, and disposing of his unreliable associates, without compunction. One of these associates, on his deathbed, mentions playing \\"the Wolf\\" in a school production of \\"Peter and the Wolf,\\" and fancied himself as a wolf, \\"until I met a real one.\\" *The title can also be taken as a metaphor describing the corruption surrounding Arkady; the \\"wolves\\" being large organizations or powerful men that eat the \\"dogs\\" (meaningless men like Arkady Renko), who are insignificant in society and prove to be nothing more but an obstacle that must be eradicated. As wolves hunt in packs to overpower their prey, so do businesses and large organizations in this novel. Allusions to real-life history, persons, or places *Most of the novel takes place in the \\"dead zone\\" around the site of the Chernobyl disaster. To \\"amuse\\" a company at dinner one night, Alex tells his own dramatic story of exactly how the meltdown occurred. *Oddly, the novel predates by several years the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, which bears certain similarities to the attacks on Pasha Ivanov. *Though there are several radioactive isotopes found at the site of the Chernobyl disaster, Caesium-137 is the most common (which may be why the killer chooses it to attack Ivanov and Timofeyev).

Window sills serve to structurally support and hold the window in place. The exterior portion of a window sill provides a mechanism for shedding rainwater away from the wall at the window opening. Therefore, window sills are usually inclined slightly downward away from the window and wall, and often extend past the exterior face of the wall. Some window sills are made of natural stone, cast stone, concrete, tile, or other non-porous materials to further increase their water resistance. Types of window sill A window sill in the most general sense is a horizontal structural element below a window opening or window unit in masonry construction or framed construction. The bottom of a window frame sits on top of the window sill of the wall opening. A window sill may span the entire width of a wall from inside to outside, as is often the case in basic masonry construction, making it visible on both the interior and exterior of the building. In such a case the exterior window sill and interior window sill would be two sides of the same structural element. Conversely, a window sill may only extend from the internal wall structure to the outside and not be visible from the building's interior. In that case the window likely has a shelf-like piece of interior trim work‚Äîoften made of wood, tile, or stone‚Äîwhich is distinct from the exterior window sill. The technical term used by carpenters, window manufacturers, and other professionals for this piece of trim work is window stool, but it is also referred to as a window sill. In residential buildings, some people use this latter kind of interior window sill or stool to store houseplants, books, or other small personal items.

He won the Seiun Award for Novel twice. His novel Shiseikan (, Administrator, one story of the \\"Shiseikan series\\"), written in 1974, was translated into English by Daniel Jackson in 2004. Mayumura was also a young adult fiction writer whose works have been adapted into TV drama, film, and anime. Mayumura was an honorary member of the SFWJ (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan).  Biography  Mayumura was born as Murakami Takuji (), at Osaka city, Osaka prefecture in 1934. He graduated from Osaka University in 1957 with a degree in economics, as well as a judo competition career at the Nanatei league. After graduation, he joined a company. While working at this company, he wrote short novels and submitted them to contests in commercial literary magazines. In 1960, he joined the SF fanzine Uch≈´jin. In 1961, he won the Best Story prize in the 1st K≈´s≈ç-Kagaku Sh≈çsetsu Contest (later the Hayakawa SF Contest) for his novel Kaky≈´ Aidea-man (Junior Idea- Man) and made debut in the S-F Magazine by this work.

As a literary theorist, he advocated the \\"Insider Bungaku-ron\\" (Theory of Literature by Insiders).Mayumura considered that literature was traditionally created by, and written from the view point of, artists who stood outside of the common society; in contrast, his literary theory insisted on the necessity of the \\"insiders\\", necessity of literature written from the common man's point of view. Consistent with this theme, his novels frequently tackle the issues of problematic relations between individuals and the corporate or bureaucratic organizations to which they belong. Mayumura was also a well-known young adult fiction writer. His representative works in this field were Nazo no Tenkousei and Nerawareta Gakuen etc. These works were adapted into TV Drama series by NHK, and adapted into Cinema too. Other juvenile fictions by Mayumura were adapted into the anime Toki no Tabibito. In 2002, his wife died of cancer. Mayumura had been writing a very short story every day for his wife, who was in the hospital bedridden since the cancer had been diagnosed. When his stories, which were written each day and numbered, reached to 1778, his wife died. These stories were compiled and published. The film Boku to Tsuma no 1778 no Monogatari, based on this true story, was filmed in 2009 and released in 2011. As of 2008, Mayumura was a professor of the Graduate School of Osaka University of Arts. He died early in the morning (at 04:01 AM in JST) of November 3, 2019 due to aspiration pneumonia.‰ΩúÂÆ∂„ÄÅÁúâÊùëÂçì„Åï„ÇìÊ≠ªÂéª 85Ê≠≥ „Äå„Å≠„Çâ„Çè„Çå„ÅüÂ≠¶Âúí„Äç„ÄåÂ¶ª„Å´Êçß„Åí„Åü1778Ë©±„Äç„ÄÅÊú¨Á¥ô„ÄåÊúùÊô¥„Çå„Ç®„ÉÉ„Çª„Éº„ÄçÈÅ∏ËÄÉÂßîÂì°„ÇÇ  Haiku poetry  Mayumura was also a haiku poet.

The Federation established local governments on those planets to establish law and order among the human settlers, and to mediate between Terrestrials and the sapient aliens who had been originally born, evolved and lived on certain of these planets before the settlers arrived. In the early period, the planets had been ruled by Federation-aligned military juntas; however, the Federation has begun to recall the military administrations and send civilian administrators to govern on their behalf.

Situated between Dundrum and Milltown, along the banks of the Slang River (also Dundrum or Slann River). History The name of the area was originally Irish Na Glas√°in, \\"the green land\\"; this was Anglicised as 'Glassons'. The name Windy Harbour or Sandy Arbour was later applied, referring to a landing-point on the River Slang. A starch mill was formerly located there. \\"Arbour\\" once had the meaning ‚Äúgrass plot, lawn, garden‚Äù; it is possible that the name was intended as a direct translation of glas√°in. Entrance to the Central Mental Hospital in Windy Arbour (built c.1850) Perhaps the most famous person to live in Windy Arbour was Irish patriot Robert Emmet, who grew up in The Casino, a manor house that is now known as Emmet House, where the Secretariat of Secondary schools in Ireland is currently housed. It is located next to the Catholic church on Bird Avenue and was formerly known as Carton House. The Central Mental Hospital is located beside the village and was built c.1850. The hospital provides treatment in high, low, and medium security conditions. Patients are referred by the courts, the prisons and local hospitals for both assessment and residential treatment. Amenities Windy Arbour has a number of shops, a supermarket, post office, pharmacy and a bakery. It is also home to several takeaways, two restaurants and two pubs. There is a primary school in Columbanus Estate known as Our Lady's National School, Clonskeagh. Windy Arbour has its own Luas station and is served by the number 17, 44, 61 and 122 bus routes. Housing Windy Arbour is surrounded by several housing estates, including Columbanus. At the centre of Windy Arbour is the smaller and much older townland of Farranboley, which appears on maps dating from the 18th century.

Its apples are sweet with a tangy finish. They are used for eating, cooking, and cider. History Although the particular origin of the Winesap is not clear, authors note that it was known during the Colonial period and is thought to have come from New Jersey. The first mention appears to be by Willich and Mease in 1804. They called the apple wine-sop and it was said to have a \\"sweet, but not sprightly taste\\". Coxe described it and provided an illustration in his 1817 book, A View of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees. Coxe and other authors mention its use for cider. Winesap was a popular apple in the United States until the 1950s. It stores well, and its decline in popularity has been attributed to the development and increased use of controlled atmosphere storage which allowed a wider variety of apples to be sold over the course of the year. Characteristics The Winesap fruit is small to medium with a deep, cherry red skin and a crisp, yellow flesh. It has moderate disease resistance including to mildew and blooms a few days later than other late varieties. It is all-purpose, being used for fresh eating, cider, apple butter, and pies. It is similar to cultivars 'Arkansas Black', 'Arkansas', and 'Paragon'. Other names for the Winesap include American Wine Sop, Banana, Hendrick's Sweet, Holland's Red Winter, Potpie, Pot Pie Apple, Red Sweet Wine Sop, Refugee, Royal Red of Kentucky, Texan Red, Winter Winesap. Many strains exist, of two types - striped or blushed. There are also many sports of the Winesap apple. Seedlings include the 'Stayman Winesap' and the Golden Winesap.

It forms part of the civil parish of Patrington. It is also the ancient seat of the Hildyard/Hilliard/Hildegardis family, whose ancestry is believed to be of Saxon origin. The Hildyard family of Winestead became extinct on the death of Sir Robert D'Arcy Hildyard, Bart., who died without heirs in 1814. Hildyard bequeathed his estates to his niece, Ann Catherine Whyte, who married in the following year Thomas Blackborne Thoroton, Esq., of Flintham Hall, Flintham, Nottingham. Col. Thoroton of the Coldstream Guards subsequently assumed the name and coat-of-arms of Hildyard. His heirs, who still have the surname Hildyard, reside at Flintham Hall today. The Hildyard family lived at Winestead for 10 generations, and even after the death of the last Baronet, the heirs continued to own Winestead Hall. In 1823 inhabitants in the village numbered 129.

The county's chief executive Mark Newton called him \\"a very accomplished and exciting young talent\\", while Dutch bowling coach Ian Pont claimed that the youngster's story had \\"shades of Graeme Hick\\" about it. Kervezee himself said that he was \\"looking forward to learning from such great players and coaches\\". Kervezee was given several opportunities in the second half of the 2009 season and made an impression with some assured displays. He scored his first half-century for the club on 30 June 2009 when he made 66 in the second innings of the game against Durham. Kervezee has been a permanent fixture in the Worcestershire side throughout the 2010 season and has consistently impressed with the bat, scoring quickly and showing stroke-making abilities of the highest order.\\"Leicestershire chase big Worcestershire target\\", BBC Sport, 6 May 2010.

International career  Kervezee rose rapidly and smartly through age-group cricket in the Netherlands, and in late July 2005, aged only 15, he made his first-class debut for his national team against Scotland in the Intercontinental Cup. This game was badly affected by the weather and Kervezee did not get to bat, but the following month in the same competition he scored 46 not out against Ireland. He also played against Kenya in March 2006. In April 2006, Kervezee played his first List A matches, for Netherlands A against India A and Pakistan A cricket team at Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi.

It is situated west of Ripon, and is on the River Laver, which flows into the River Skell (a tributary of the River Ure) just outside Ripon. Winksley is surrounded by farmland and is close to several woodlands including Hencliffe wood, Kendale wood, and North wood. Demography Winksley Total Population 1811‚Äì2011 As Winksley is a small parish in North Yorkshire therefore it has a relatively small population density of 142 people. There are 119 persons over the age of 16, the largest age group is adults aged between 35‚Äì54 indicating that Winksley is a quiet and more family orientated area. The two next largest age groups are 55‚Äì64 with 24 people and 65‚Äì74 with 22 people illustrating this is a place where many people like to retire. The population has not changed over the past two centuries, in 1811 the population was 143 persons, showing that Winksley is still at present a rural and relatively isolated area in North Yorkshire. The number of females and males is still unchanged with a slightly higher female population of 74 in both 1811 and 2011, the male population of Winksley has decreased by one from 69 in 1811 to 68 males in 2011. Even though the population in the early 1800s and the current population are extremely similar, during the mid 19th century there was a significant increase in Winksley's population. According to the historical population reports of England, in 1821 the population increased to 176 persons and by 1831 the population rocketed to 259 persons, in total Winksley's population increased by 116 people over 20 years. 1831 was the beginning of the industrial revolution; in the towns and cities that surrounded Winksley there would have been an increase in work for young men. But there was still agricultural work in Winksley although the number of people working in agriculture decreased from 18 in 1811 to 10 in 1831. There are a total of 59 households in Winksley. The majority of households are one family only, twelve households are families with children, another twelve households are married couples with no children. There are nineteen households with residents over the age of 65. There are 28 households that have only 2 residents, the next majority is one person households at 11 dwellings in Winksley and there is only one house with 6 persons. Therefore, showing Winksley is more a retirement area than a family one. According to 2011 census data, 48 households are detached houses or bungalows, illustrating that Winksley is a reasonably wealthy area. Winksley house prices vary with houses, but houses tend to start at approximately ¬£140,000,nearby Ripon gives a better indication of house types and prices with some priced at approximately ¬£180,000 and other at ¬£900,000. Landmarks Even though Winksley is a small village it still attracts tourists, the Woodhouse farm is located in Winksley. It is a touring caravan, camping, and holiday home park. Winksley sits between the Yorkshire Dales and the North Yorkshire Moors, so is perfect for fishing and country walks. The Woodhouse farm is a relatively popular campsite, particularly in the summer months; it has many facilities on site including a restaurant, a shop, a young children's play area and a newly established cycle track for mountain biking. The location of Woodhouse farm provides easy access to other tourist sites such as Ripon Cathedral, Brimham Rocks, Fountains Abbey, Lightwater Valley, Malham, and Studley Royal. Transport Winksley, even though a small village has six bus routes. The six bus routes include: *Route number 139, Ripon service *Route number 641H, school service (Fares and permits) *Route number 703H, school service (Permits only) *Route number 707H, school service (Permits only) *Route number 708H, school service (Permits only) *Route number 739H, school service (Fares and permits).

She was the second daughter of Prince Imperial Ui of Korea, the fifth son of Emperor Gojong of Korea and his concubine, Lady Sudeokdang. Yi was one of the pretenders, as well as her nephew, Yi Won, who claimed to be the legitimate heir to the throne of the Korean Imperial Household. Yi died in February 2020 at the age of 100. Birth and marriage Yi was born in Sadong Palace, which was an official residence of her family in Seoul and raised in Unhyeon Palace. She graduated from Kyunggi Girls' High School in 1936 and then married Lee Seunggyu (Yi Seung-gyu), who was kidnapped and compulsorily taken to North Korea during the Korean War. They had three sons and one daughter. Coronation Following the death of her cousin Yi Ku on 16 July 2005, members of the imperial family chose his adopted son, Yi Won, as the next Head of the Korean Imperial Household, bestowing on him the title, the Hereditary Prince Imperial of Korea (Hwangsason), representative of an inherited title from Yi Ku. Contesting her nephew's claim and appointment to the throne, Yi Haew≈èn announced the restoration of the Korean Imperial Household. A private coronation ceremony was held on 29 September 2006, during which Yi Haew≈èn was bestowed the title, the \\"Empress of Korea\\". According to one of her half- brothers, Yi Seok, who was another pretender, other close royal member didn't approve such a ceremony; Yi Seok himself was also invited, but he didn't attend the ceremony, for he didn't know who the members of the \\"Imperial Family Association of Daehanjeguk\\" are.

It is named in part after the former province of Tembien. Part of the Mehakelegnaw Zone, Kola Tembien is bordered on the south by Abergele, on the west by the Tekez√© River which separates it from the Semien Mi'irabawi (North Western) Zone, on the north by the Wari River which separates it from Naeder Adet and Werie Lehe, on the east by Misraqawi (Eastern) Zone, and on the southeast by Degua Tembien. Towns in Kola Tembien include Guya and Werkamba. The town of Abiy Addi is surrounded by Kola Tembien. The Tsaliet River (near Addeha), a tributary to Weri'i River  Demographics  The population pyramid has a wide base, not unlike most other low-income countries. However, the two lower age groups show that the pyramid base has stopped widening; this concerns particularly the group of 0‚Äì9 years old with an even more pronounced effect in the group of 0‚Äì4 years old, thus indicating a timid onset of a demographic transition. This may be related to the improved health services and a changing position of women in the society. Indeed, a revised Family Code came into effect in 2000, advocating the principles of gender equality. This raised the minimum age of marriage from 15 to 18 years old and established women rights in terms of sharing any assets the household has accumulated. The Ethiopian penal code states that it is a crime to beat one‚Äôs wife, and harmful traditional practices such as early marriage, abduction and female genital mutilation are now also considered to be a crime. Nowadays, almost all children are going to school but girls frequently drop out when they reach the age of 13 to 15 years: schools have no facilities for menstrual hygiene management and this is a major reason to interrupt schooling. Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this woreda has a total population of 134,336, an increase of 28.13% over the 1994 census, of whom 66,925 are men and 67,411 women; 0 or 0.00% are urban inhabitants. With an area of 2,538.39 square kilometers, Kola Tembien has a population density of 52.92, which is 56.29 than the Zone average of 0 persons per square kilometer. A total of greater households were counted in this woreda, resulting in an average of 8,871 persons to a household, and 28,917 housing units. The majority of the inhabitants said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 99.86% reporting that as their religion.Census 2007 Tables: Tigray Region , Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5 and 3.4. The 1994 national census reported a total population for this woreda of 113,712, of whom 56,453 were men and 57,259 were women; 8,871 or 7.8% of its population were urban dwellers. The largest ethnic group reported in Kola Tembien was the Tigrayan (99.88%). Tigrinya was spoken as a first language by 99.82%. 98.23% of the population practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 1.69% were Muslim. Concerning education, 9.15% of the population were considered literate, which is less than the Zone average of 14.21%; 8.64% of children aged 7‚Äì12 were in primary school; 0.72% of the children aged 13‚Äì14 were in junior secondary school, and 0.86% of the inhabitants aged 15‚Äì18 were in senior secondary school. Concerning sanitary conditions, about 86% of the urban houses and 17% of all houses had access to safe drinking water at the time of the census; 11% of the urban and 3% of the total had toilet facilities.1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region, Vol. 1, part 1 , Tables 2.1, 2.12, 2.19, 3.5, 3.7, 6.3, 6.11, 6.13 (accessed 30 December 2008)  History of Kola Tembien  See: History of Tembien Rock churches Like several other districts in Tigray, Kola Tembien holds its share of rock- hewn or monolithic churches. These have literally been hewn from rock, mostly before the 10th C. CE. Notable landmarks in this woreda include the monastery of Abba Yohanni and the monolithic church of Gebriel Wukien, both of which are north of Abiy Addi. Six rock-hewn churches are established along the slopes of the Degua Tembien massif. The Mika‚Äôel Samba () rock church is completely rock hewn in Adigrat Sandstone. There are a series of grave cells leading off the main space. As this is not a village church, people come here only rarely, and it is locked most of the time. Priests are present particularly on Mika‚Äôels day, the twelfth day of every month in the Ethiopian calendar. The Maryam Hibeto rock church (), located inconspicuously at the edge of the church forest and cemetery, is also completely hewn in Adigrat Sandstone, with an arched pronaos in front of it. The exterior of the colonnade column has a double capital. The ceiling is carved, and on either side are two elongated chambers which could have been the beginnings of an ambulatory, or else were living quarters. The main entrance to the church is at a lower level, down a number of steps and immediately on entering, a rectangular pool of water fed by a spring to the right. The floor is not level and the columns are stumpy with the springing coming halfway up the columns and oddly cut capitals. The Welegesa church () is hewn in Adigrat Sandstone. The entrance to the church buildings is in reality part of the rock forming two enclosures or courtyards, both hewn and open to the air. In the first courtyard there are a number of graves, and between the two, a block of stone with a cross in the window opening in the centre. The church proper, three-aisled, four bays in depth, is entered from either side through hewn passageways. The church ceiling is the same height throughout, with capitals, arches and cupolas to each bay, with a hewn tabot in the apse. The plan is sophisticated, with a central axis running north-south and the two open courtyards cut deep into the rock. The newly hewn Medhanie Alem rock church in Mt. Werqamba () is in a central, smaller peak (in Adigrat Sandstone). High in the mountains northwest of Abiy Addi, the Geramba rock church () is hewn in the top of a butte of Tertiary silicified limestone, under a thin cover of basalt. The columns are rather crudely carved, although slightly cruciform in plan and with bracket capitals much modified before the springing of the rough arches. Itsiwto Maryam rock church () is completely hewn in Adigrat Sandstone. The small church has an unusual continuous hipped ceiling to the centre aisle with carved diagonal crosses to the last section and a cross carved above the arch into the sanctuary. The ceiling is flat to the side aisles with longitudinal flat beams running lengthwise into the church, projecting and forming a continuous lintel ‚Äì very similar to workmanship following the Tigrayan tradition. Access to the church is not permitted because of risk of collapse. Further up, in the Degua Tembien mountains at the east, there are an additional eight rock churches and natural caves with a church at its entrance.  Agriculture  A sample enumeration performed by the CSA in 2001 interviewed 27,665 farmers in this woreda, who held an average of 0.81 hectares of land. Of the 22,402 hectares of private land surveyed, 85.28% was in cultivation, 0.87% pasture, 10.78% fallow, 0.23% woodland, and 2.84% was devoted to other uses. For the land under cultivation in this woreda, 78.02% was planted in cereals, 4.61% in pulses, 1.82% in oilseeds, and 0.08% in vegetables. The area planted in gesho was 36 hectares; the amount of land planted in fruit trees is missing. 77.26% of the farmers both raised crops and livestock, while 19.75% only grew crops and 2.98% only raised livestock. Land tenure in this woreda is distributed amongst 89.01% owning their land, and 10.48% renting; the percentage reported as holding their land under other forms of tenure is missing.\\"Central Statistical Authority of Ethiopia.

Dunes are locally formed in places with wind shade. Aeolian deposition near Addeha  Reservoirs  In this district with rains that last only for a couple of months per year, reservoirs of different sizes allow harvesting runoff from the rainy season for further use in the dry season. The reservoirs of the district include Addi Asme'e. Overall, these reservoirs suffer from rapid siltation. Part of the water that could be used for irrigation is lost through seepage; the positive side-effect is that this contributes to groundwater recharge.

The population taken at the 2011 census was 272. The village, which is north-west of Garstang, has an agricultural college, and the Duchy of Lancaster has an estate here. This includes the local pub, the Patten Arms. It is home to the great manor of Winmarleigh Hall. Constructed to the order of the Duchy of Lancaster, it was given to the first Lord Winmarleigh. Since then the house has been donated to NST Travel Group, who have turned the grounds into an outdoor education programme for schools across the country. Winmarleigh railway station opened in 1870 on the Garstang and Knot-End Railway. It was renamed Nateby railway station in 1902 and closed in 1930. The school and school house, which date from 1870, were designed by Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. Estate The Winmarleigh Estate is an estate of the Duchy of Lancaster holding as part of The Lancashire Survey. The estate holds ownership to the Patten Arms pub. In March 2011, ten estate farms were offered to the tenant farmers for purchase as a part of a Duchy re-balancing asset plan to reduce its rural assets. Six of the farms were close to closing by June 2012 to their tenant farmers while New Hall Farm's tenant wished to retire. Also a portion of the estate was transferred to the Village Hall Committee as it adjacent to the Hall and is used for recreation.

Cairns received his M.D. from Oxford. He then worked as a virologist at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia and at the Virus Research Institute at Entebbe, Uganda. He returned to Australia to work in the School of Microbiology at the John Curtin School of Medical Research. Cairns took a sabbatical to research at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory between 1960 and 1961, and returned there to serve as the director from 1963 to 1968. He remained a staff member at Cold Spring Harbor until 1972, when he was appointed head of the Mill Hill Laboratory of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. After leaving Mill Hill in 1980 he took up a professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health. He retired in 1991. In his 1963 paper \\"The bacterial chromosome and its manner of replication as seen by autoradiography\\", Cairns demonstrated by autoradiography that the DNA of the bacterium Escherichia coli was a single molecule that is replicated at a moving locus (the replicating fork) at which both new DNA strands are being synthesized. Subsequently, it was found that there were in fact two moving forks, traveling simultaneously in opposite directions around the chromosome. In 1974 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1981, John Cairns received a MacArthur Foundation (\\"genius\\") Fellowship. He is the author of the 1978 book Cancer: Science and Society (now out of print) and the 1997 book, Matters of Life and Death: Perspectives on Public Health, Molecular Biology, Cancer, and the Prospects for the Human Race.

Based on the 1987-1996 comic book of the same name (also known as Xenozoic Tales) by Mark Schultz, the show was created by screenwriter Steven E. de Souza, who acquired the TV rights after producing the video game Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, which was also based on Schultz's comic. The show dealt with many strong ecological and political issues that were central to the plot development. Plot The series followed the exploits of Jack Tenrec and his crew of ecological freedom fighters known as the \\"Mechanics\\". His often-reluctant companion is the foreign ambassador Hannah Dundee. She hires Jack as a liaison, while she attempts to create clear communication between her land and the modern civilization. Together, they confront the serious issues facing the futuristic environment that humanity has come to inhabit. Jack also has Hermes, a juvenile \\"cutter\\" that Jack hand-reared after the latter's mother's death. Gentle with Jack and Hannah, he can still be rather fierce when angered. The show also includes a race of intelligent lizards called \\"Griths\\". Jack and his crew square off against opposition, including the Council of Governors and Hammer Terhune's gang.

Further Amaranth Advisors told investors that it was working with lenders for maintaining liquidity while also and now selling portfolio holdings \\"to protect our investors.\\" Traders sold securities that could be liquidated without undermining and disrupting the energy market; these included convertible bonds and high-yield corporate debt. Transferring energy portfolio The fund had up to $9 billion under management and reports indicated their losses may have exceeded 65 percent of their investment. Amaranth transferred its energy portfolio to a third party consisting of Citadel LLC and JPMorgan Chase. October 1, 2006 Fund suspends trading On September 29, 2006, Amaranth's founder sent a letter to fund investors notifying them of the fund's suspension and on October 1, 2006, Amaranth hired the Fortress Investment Group to liquidate its assets. In September 2006 Amaranth Advisors investors were informed that they could not pull their money out and that redemptions would be temporarily suspended for two months. Ten years later 90% of assets had been returned and 10% of investor assets were still frozen through December 2016. Clients Amaranth Advisors' investors included pension funds, endowments, banks and brokerage firms including Institutional Fund of Hedge Funds at Morgan Stanley. Pension fund clients included San Diego County Employees Retirement Association. Investigations 2007 CFTC investigation On July 25, 2007, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged Amaranth and Hunter with attempting to manipulate the price of natural gas futures. Additionally, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission charged Amaranth, Hunter and trader Matthew Donohoe with market manipulation. The CFTC and the FERC had conflicting versions of what Hunter did, and are currently competing over jurisdiction.The Man Who Lost $6B In 2014 Hunter settled with the CFTC, paying a $750,000 fine and accepting a ban from trading all CFTC-regulated natural- gas products. 2010 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission On January 22, 2010, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative law judge ruled that Hunter violated the Commission's Anti-Manipulation Rule. Judge Carmen Cintron found that \\"Hunter intentionally manipulated the settlement price of the at-issue natural gas futures contracts. His trading was specifically designed to lower the NYMEX price in order to benefit his swap positions on other exchanges.\\" The decision is subject to review by the Commission. Legal In November 2007 Amaranth Advisors filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan claiming $1 billion in damages on the grounds that the bank interfered in the company's efforts to avoid collapse after natural-gas trades losses in 2006. The suit claimed that JP Morgan as Amaranth Advisors's clearing broker use their position to prevent Amaranth Advisors from derisking their exposure from its natural-gas derivatives portfolio by preventing the portfolio from being sold to first Goldman Sachs and later Citadel LLC. In December 2012, the New York State Court of Appeals upheld an earlier dismissal of the case. During the collapse of Amaranth Advisors, Centaurus was credited as being one of the major players on the other side of their position. Criticism During the week of September 11, 2006, one week before clients were notified of loses, Amaranth Advisors was seeking new investors and marketing their fund as being up 25 percent for the year. The New York Times reported that Amaranth Advisors said it was a multi-strategy fund though acted \\"like an energy and commodities fund. When it bet big on natural gas and lost, it was apparent that it was neither multistrategy nor particularly well hedged\\" and also that in Amaranth Advisors' case \\" 'multistrategy' seems to have been a misnomer at the fund.\\" References Further reading *\\"Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas Market\\", United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, June 25, 2007 Category:Financial services companies established in 2000 Category:Financial services companies disestablished in 2007 Category:Defunct financial services companies of the United States Category:Hedge fund firms of the United States Category:Defunct hedge funds Category:Greenwich, Connecticut Category:Companies based in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:Defunct companies based in Connecticut ","title":"Amaranth Advisors"},{"id":"7215856","text":"US naval jack (2002‚Äì2019) being raised on a jackstaff in 2002 A jack staff (also spelled as jackstaff) is a small vertical spar (pole) on the bow of a ship or smaller vessel on which a particular type of flag, known as a jack, is flown.

Early life Engman was born in 1927 to parents who had emigrated from Sweden. He joined the Navy at the age of 15, serving in World War II in the Pacific. He graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA, and from Yale University with an MFA in Painting and in Sculpture (1955), where he studied with sculptor Jos√© de Rivera and Josef Albers.Column, 1963, Public art at Yale Albers wrote of him: ‚ÄúOnly a few independent ones were courageous enough to concentrate on the plane‚Äîthe in-between of volume and line‚Äîas a broad sculptural concept and promise.‚Äù Career The Yale Years: 1953-1964 Engman taught sculpture at Yale University, and, in 1960, was appointed director of Yale's sculpture program in its Graduate School of Fine Arts. He worked closely with Joseph Albers, James Rosati and Paul Rudolph, and produced his monumental work, Column, (1963) for Rudolph's new building for the Yale Art & Architecture program.Engman, Robert, Column, (1963) Culture Now: Museum Without Walls. Retrieved 2020-3-20 Represented by Arthur and Madeleine Lejwa's influential Galerie ChaletteGalerie Chalette Records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Museum, Washington, DC. in New York, his work attracted the attention of Joseph Hirshhorn, who began to actively collect Engman's sculptures. Philadelphia and the Grand Scale: 1964-1978 In 1964, Engman moved to Pennsylvania, where he became director of the University of Pennsylvania's graduate studies in sculpture. He was a frequent visiting critic at East Coast schools of art during his teaching career. In the 1960s and '70s, his career flourished, with successful New York gallery shows and larger and larger scale commissions, culminating in Triune,(1975) a 20-foot- high structure of interlocking bronze curves. Haverford: the Private Studio: After 1978 The physical effort required to complete Triune brought a check to Engman's artistic drive to \\"dominate the materials.\\" In 1978, he changed his approach to art. With rare exceptions, Engman eschewed the factory approach to sculpture, preferring to personally construct his pieces. He retreated from the world of large-scale commissions, and began work on a series of more intimately-scaled pieces that did not require a workshop of helpers to complete. Theory of Sculpture The sinuous curves of Engman's work are derived from the artist‚Äôs explorations of minimal surfaces to generate sculptural form. Minimal surfaces are mathematically the most economical connections between loops or lines in three-dimensional space. Engman created assemblages of minimal surface configurations to form geometrically-based sculptures that could, at the time of their production, be described mathematically only after they had been physically created in metal or wood. In Engman's own words, \\"they cannot be conceived of through any other system than that of the giving of substance to thought.\\" Others have been fascinated with the science and mathematics of such surfaces, including the late R. Buckminster Fuller.Robert Engman page, Philadelphia Public Art @ philart.net Works *A Study in Growth, (1958) in the MOMA permanent collection.Engman, Robert, A Study in Growth, MOMA, New York, NY.

The stamp, showing the yellow background inverted relative to the image and text, is also known as the Day's Folly after Postmaster General J. Edward Day who ordered the intentional reprinting of the yellow invert commenting, \\"The Post Office Department is not running a jackpot operation.\\" The stamp reprint was in effect a deliberate error produced by the Post Office Department to avoid creating a rarity. It was decided to reprint 40 million of the inverted stamps after the discovery of the error so there would be no rarity factor in the inverted stamp and to prevent people profiting from the Postal Service's mistake. The reprints were issued to the public on 16 November and described as a Special Printing. The black, brown and yellow commemorative stamp with yellow background correctly printed has a Scott catalogue number of 1203 but the inverted error is numbered 1204. The catalogue value of the invert is worth little more than the normal. The stamp, printed on Giori press in plates of 200, was designed by Herbert Sanborn and engraved by C. A. Brooks. 121,440,000 normal stamps were printed and 40,270,000 of the inverted reprint were produced. Normal stamp It has not been recorded how many original invert stamps were produced and it is virtually impossible to tell a reprint from an original unless it has a clear early date, but an invert error on a first day cover, proving that stamp was from the original printing and not from the reprint, was sold in 2005 for US $3,500. The finder of the discovery sheet, a New Jersey jeweler named Leonard Sherman, obtained a court injunction against the reprinting, but it came too late to stop production. He did however receive an affidavit from the (then) Post Office Department that his was the original sheet. In 1987 Sherman donated his sheet to the American Philatelic Society because the reprint dashed his hopes of owning a valuable stamp error. Mad magazine later commemorated the affair by printing a parody stamp that looked similar to the real issue, but put a crying Sherman in place of Hammarskjold with money flying away from him.

Investigation was closed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) on September 19, 2008 citing insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges as both \\"Congress and Mr. Foley denied us access to critical data\\", said FDLE Commissioner Gerald Bailey. The scandal grew to encompass the response of Republican congressional leaders to previous complaints about Foley's contacts with the pages and inconsistencies in the leaders' public statements. There were also allegations that a second Republican Congressman, Jim Kolbe, had improper conduct with at least two youths, a 16-year-old page and a recently graduated page. The scandal led to Foley's resignation from Congress on September 29, 2006. In some quarters, the scandal is believed to have contributed to the Republican Party's loss of control over Congress in the November 7, 2006 election, as well as the end of House Speaker Dennis Hastert's leadership of the House Republicans. Kirk Fordham, chief of staff to Rep. Tom Reynolds and former chief of staff for Foley, also resigned as a result of the scandal. Newsweeks June 7, 2010, issue's Back Story listed Foley, among others, as a prominent conservative politician who had a record of anti-gay legislation and was later caught in a gay sex scandal.Newsweek, 2010-06-07, p. 56 The questionable conversations, which took place between 1995 and 2005, were investigated by the FBI for possible criminal violations. In September 2008, Florida officials investigating Foley decided not to charge him, citing a lack of evidence and the expiration of the statute of limitations. The House Ethics Committee investigated the response of the House Republican leadership and their staff to earlier warnings about Foley's conduct. In early October 2006, two news organizations anonymously quoted former pages who said that they had sexual liaisons with Foley after turning 18 and 21. Foley was chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, which introduced legislation targeting sexual predators and created stricter guidelines for tracking them. Messages E-mails In 2005, Foley sent five e-mails to a 16-year-old former page from Monroe, Louisiana who had been sponsored by Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-LA). They were the first messages to be made public in the scandal. Among other things, Foley asked for a photo of the page, his age and birthday, and what he wanted for a birthday present. Foley observed that another male page (to whom he had also written) was \\"in really great shape ... i am just finished riding my bike on a 25 mile journey ...\\" The page forwarded the e-mails to a colleague in Alexander's office, saying \\"this really freaked me out\\", and repeating the word \\"sick\\" 13 times in a row to describe the photo request. The page asked \\"if you can, please tell Rodney [Alexander] about this\\", and in addition, mentioned a female page who had been warned about a Congressman who \\"hit on\\" interns. ABC News reported on October 5 that in 2002, Foley e-mailed one page with an invitation to stay at the congressman's home in exchange for oral sex. The page, who was 17 years-old at the time, declined the offer. The same report stated that he e-mailed another with a request for a photograph of his erect penis. Another former page reported that he saw sexually explicit e-mails sent to one page from his page class of 2001‚Äì2002, and learned of \\"three or four\\" pages from that class who received similar e-mails. Instant messages After the initial story on the e-mails, other pages contacted ABC and The Washington Post, providing transcripts of sexually explicit instant messaging (IM) conversations from 2003 that Foley had with two pages who were under the age of 18 at the time. The Washington Post reported it had received its copies of the same IMs from a page who had served on Capitol Hill with the two pages to whom they had been addressed. Another former page, Tyson Vivyan, said that he had received \\"sexually suggestive\\" messages from Foley in 1997, a month after he left the page program. A page from the class of 1998 also reported receiving explicit IMs from Foley. A page from the class of 2000 reported he chatted with Foley during the Congressman's 2000 visit to the page dormitory, and afterwards, he began receiving e-mails and IMs from Foley, which became explicit immediately after his 18th birthday. Sources of messages and chronology In November 2005, the initial five e-mails were leaked out of Alexander's office, after the recipient (a page whom Alexander sponsored) reported them to the Congressman. Two Florida newspapers, the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald, and the Fox News Channel acquired copies of these e-mails in November 2005, but decided not to publish a story. According to an editor at the St. Petersburg Times, they received the e-mails from a source in Alexander's office. The St. Petersburg Times editors decided the exchange was probably just \\"friendly chit-chat\\". Nonetheless, they assigned two reporters to investigate in November 2005\\\\. The recipient of the e-mail refused to cooperate with the reporters, and no other pages they interviewed had complaints about correspondence with Foley. The Times revisited their investigation \\"more than once\\", ultimately choosing not to break the story. Ken Silverstein, an editor at Harper's Magazine, said that he received copies of the five e-mails in May 2006 from a \\"Democratic operative\\". Silverstein subsequently wrote a story on the e-mails, which was cancelled due to a lack of absolute proof that Foley was anything more than \\"creepy\\". He said that his source \\"was not working in concert with the national Democratic Party\\" but was \\"genuinely disgusted\\" by Foley's behavior. Silverstein himself passed the information to other media organizations after cancelling the story. In July 2006, a paid Republican Congressional staffer sent copies of the e-mails to several Washington media organizations through an intermediary. The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) said it received copies of the e-mails on July 21 and turned them over to the FBI that same day. In August 2006, ABC News reporter Brian Ross received the initial e-mails from a Republican source but did not write a story for over a month because he was working on other stories. On September 24, 2006, the e-mails were released by Lane Hudson on his anonymous blog Stop Sex Predators. Hudson was at the time employed by the Human Rights Campaign. When the HRC found out about Hudson's activity during the week of October 25, 2006, it publicly fired him for misusing its resources. At the time of his firing, the Board of Directors of HRC included Jeff Trandahl, who also had prior knowledge and involvement with the issue. The political humor blog Wonkette drew readers' attention to the posted e-mails on September 27. The next day, September 28, Ross reported on the e-mails which he had received in August. After that initial story, two sources brought copies of more explicit instant messages to ABC News and The Washington Post. Both were former pages ‚Äì the first was a Republican who would \\"never vote for a Democrat\\", and the second was a Democrat from the same class as the two pages who received the messages. On November 20, 2015, it was revealed that Zack Stanton, a congressional page from 2001 until 2002, was the source of the transcripts provided to ABC and the Washington Post. Physical contact In early-October 2006, two news organizations anonymously quoted former pages as saying that they had sexual liaisons with Foley after they turned 18 and 21, respectively. Visits and meetings On at least two different occasions, one in the summer of 2000 and one in 2002 or 2003, Foley allegedly visited the dormitory where pages live. On the first occasion, he drove up in his BMW automobile during a nighttime \\"mixer\\" party. Students came out of the dorm to talk with him and were warned away by an adult supervisor in the page program, who shooed them back inside. In the second visit, Newsweek reported that Foley showed up at the dormitory after the 10 P.M. curfew, apparently drunk, and attempted to enter the building. He was reportedly turned away by a security guard. Other meetings include a dinner with one former page, then 17, after which he invited the youth back to his hotel room and \\"touched his leg\\", and a visit by two pages in 1997 to Foley's Washington condo where they consumed pizza and soda. Another page reported that Foley repeatedly invited him out for ice cream. Sexual liaisons Though Foley is not alleged to have engaged in sexual relations with pages during the time of their service, he allegedly had, on at least two occasions, sexual relationships with ex-pages. In communications with one of the pages, who chose to remain anonymous, Foley appeared to emphasize that while he assessed the attractions and orientation of pages, he waited until they had left the program to engage the youth in erotic activities: \\"I always knew you were a player but I don't fool around with pages.\\" The Los Angeles Times contacted the anonymous former page, according to a report in the paper on October 8, \\"after others identified him as someone whose contacts with Foley went beyond graphic messages.\\" The page said that after leaving the page program, he began receiving instant messages from Maf54, Mark Foley's chat username, that quickly became provocative in nature. According to the Times: The ex-page said that in the fall of 2000, when he was 21 years old, he engaged in sexual intercourse with Foley at the congressman's Washington residence. According to the former page's account, \\"[t]he two had wine and pizza on a backyard patio and then retired to a spare bedroom.\\" Another former page told ABC News that Foley arranged a sexual liaison with him but only after he turned 18. Foley's response After the initial e-mails had been publicized, Foley's office confirmed that Foley had sent the messages but said they were innocuous, and accused his election opponent of orchestrating a smear. Shortly after being questioned by ABC about the more explicit IMs ‚Äì and before they had been publicly revealed ‚Äì Foley resigned from Congress. The congressman issued a statement, saying, \\"I am deeply sorry and I apologize for letting down my family and the people of Florida I have had the privilege to represent.\\" Kirk Fordham, Chief of Staff to Representative and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Reynolds of New York, and former Chief of Staff to Foley, said that he was with Foley when ABC confronted him with the explicit IMs. Fordham said that he asked Foley if they were authentic, and that Foley replied, \\"Probably.\\" According to Newsweek, Foley \\"knew he was finished.\\" Fordham then visited GOP headquarters to inform Hastert and Reynolds; he returned with a one-sentence resignation letter that Foley signed. A short time later, Foley submitted his resignation to Governor Jeb Bush and left the capital. Once the scandal broke in full, Foley had virtually no chance of staying in Congress. Hastert and Reynolds let it be known that if Foley did not sign the resignation letter, they would have sought his expulsion from the House. Polls showed him losing badly to his Democratic challenger, businessman Tim Mahoney. On October 2, Foley checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic for alcoholism. On October 3 Foley's lawyer stated, \\"Mark Foley has never, ever had inappropriate sexual contact with a minor in his life. He is absolutely, positively not a pedophile.\\" He also stated that Foley himself was a victim of sexual assault by an unnamed clergyman as a child, that the inappropriate conversations were the result of a secret alcohol problem and primarily occurred while Foley was intoxicated, and that Foley is gay. Previously, when confronted with speculations that he was gay, Foley labeled them \\"revolting and unforgivable\\". However, Foley's sexuality had been an open secret in Washington for many years. Alleged molestation of Foley After demands to do so, Foley privately identified the priest he alleged had abused him as a child. However, the public revelation of his identity, Anthony Mercieca, a 69-year-old Catholic priest now living in Malta, came through the investigative reporting of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. Parallel to Foley's disclosure, Mercieca held several interviews in which he described a two-year relationship with Foley from when the youth was a thirteen-year-old altar boy at Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Lake Worth, Florida, until he was fifteen. He told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune about a number of intimate occasions that the priest claimed \\"Foley might perceive as sexually inappropriate\\", such as \\"massaging Foley while the boy was naked, skinny-dipping together at a secluded lake in Lake Worth and being naked in the same room on overnight trips.\\" Mercieca hinted at an even more intimate event, which he claimed took place while he was under the influence of tranquilizers and alcohol, and which he could not clearly recollect, and that he taught Foley \\"some wrong things\\" related to sex, which he did not specify. In a separate AP interview, he recounted that: \\"We were friends and trusted each other as brothers and loved each other as brothers. It was not what you call intercourse ... There was no rape or anything ... Maybe light touches here or there.\\" And he told a Florida TV station that it was not abuse, which is against someone's will: \\"He seemed to like it, you know? So it was sort of more like a spontaneous thing.\\" The Archdiocese of Miami issued a statement apologizing to Foley for \\"the hurt he experienced\\" from the priest's \\"morally reprehensible\\" actions, and suspended Mercieca's faculties. According to Mercieca, he had last seen Foley at a dinner meeting 18 years before, in a restaurant in Fort Worth. When asked whether he had anything to say to Foley, Mercieca said, \\"Remember the good times we had together, you know, and how well we enjoyed each other's company.\\" He added, \\"Don't keep dwelling on this thing, you know?\\" Mercieca could not be prosecuted for his activities with Foley because the relevant statutes of limitations had expired, and the Palm Beach County state attorney's office \\"cannot conduct an investigation because Foley has declined to press charges.\\" A childhood friend of Foley's, Jon Ombres, confirmed the close friendship between the two, and suggested that there may have been a second priest, sexually interested in youths and with whom Foley was on good terms, active in the parish at that time. As of October 25, Mercieca faced new accusations, leveled by a former altar boy who claims having been abused by him in the seventies at the age of twelve. Mercieca, speaking through his lawyer, denied the second accusation, claiming that it is \\"at best as a figment of the imagination and at worst a malicious fabrication.\\" On July 18, 2007, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami settled a lawsuit brought against it by the former altar boy. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The lawsuit had sought more than $10,000,000 in damages. Other Congressmen As an apparent result of the Foley scandal, allegations of inappropriate contact with pages have been made against other congressmen. Jim Kolbe Two allegations were made against another Republican Congressman, Jim Kolbe. The first to be made public involves a 1996 rafting trip Kolbe took on the Colorado River with two recently graduated, 17 year-old male pages, as well as Kolbe's sister, five of his staffers, and Gary Cummins, the deputy superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park at the time. An anonymous participant told NBC that he was \\"creeped out\\" by the attention Kolbe paid to one of the pages, adding that Kolbe did a lot of \\"fawning, petting and touching\\" on the teenager's arms, shoulders and back. The page in question declined to address that statement, telling NBC, \\"I just don't want to get into this ... because I might possibly be considered for a job in the administration.\\" He did say that he had a \\"blast\\" on the trip and did not report anything improper to his parents or page officials afterwards. On the day that the Justice Department investigation of the first allegation was made public, October 12, 2006, Kolbe's spokeswoman Korenna Cline said that his office had not been contacted by the Justice Department or House Ethics Committee. She then resigned abruptly, saying \\"I have decided to pursue another job opportunity and today is my last day.\\" In the second allegation, a page told the FBI and House Clerk's office that he was \\"uncomfortable with a particular social encounter\\" including physical contact that occurred in 2001 when he and Kolbe were alone. The page was 16 at the time and had not reported the incident. These allegations were also been the topic of a conference call between the members of the House Page Review Board, which referred the matter to the House Ethics Committee since it did not have jurisdiction over Congressmen. Trandahl, speaking as the former House Clerk, reportedly stated that Kolbe was one of a small group of \\"problem members\\" of congress who frequently socialized with House pages in inappropriate ways. Unnamed congressman Congressman Jerry Weller (R-IL) sent the House Page Board and House Ethics Committee a report that a page he sponsored was \\"inappropriately invited to a social function by another congressman.\\" He declined to make any further details public. Congress Other leaders whose roles have been criticized include Reynolds, John Boehner, John Shimkus, Ken Mehlman, and Sue W. Kelly. Also significant in the scandal is the office of Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives. The Clerk is responsible for the effective administration of all personnel matters, including those relating to the house pages. The two Clerks of the House during the scandal were Jeff Trandahl and Karen Haas; the latter was elevated to the position from being floor assistant for Hastert after Trandahl resigned on November 18, 2005. Knowledge before September 2006 At least thirteen Republican Congressmen or congressional staffers acknowledged that they knew of the five initial e-mails before they were made public: Majority Leader John Boehner (Ohio); Reynolds; Alexander and John Shimkus (Ill.) (Chairman of the House Page Board); Hastert, Mike Stokke, Ted Van Der Meid, and Tim Kennedy in Hastert's office; Paula Nowakowski, Boehner's chief of staff; Trandahl; Royal Alexander, Alexander's chief of staff (no relation) and another Alexander staffer, Danielle Savoy, Fordham; Kolbe, and Kolbe's staffer. While at first no Democratic Congressman or staffers were shown to have had such knowledge, later investigation suggested that the House Democratic Caucus and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee were also aware of the initial emails 1995‚Äì1999 Kurt Wolfe, the journalist who first outed Foley in The Advocate in 1996, said that one of the original independent sources he found to corroborate Foley's orientation was an ex-page. An adult by the time of his meeting with Wolfe, he described having been \\"the recipient of many inappropriate sexual communications from Foley\\" while a minor. Wolfe contacted Foley's office for comment, and was rebuffed. Nevertheless, he asserts about Foley's staff: \\"They were notified.\\" Several current and former congressional employees recalled Foley approaching young male pages at parties, going back many years, and say that warnings about him were commonly passed around. Generally speaking, he was \\"known to be extraordinarily friendly in a way that made some [pages] uncomfortable.\\" According to Mark Beck-Heyman, who served as a Republican page in summer 1995, \\"Almost the first day I got there I was warned. It was no secret that Foley had a special interest in male pages.\\" He alleged that many people on Capitol Hill, including Republican staffers, \\"have known for over 11 years about what was going on and chose to do nothing.\\" Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said on MSNBC that \\"I've had people now on staff that used to be pages, and it was widely known to watch out for him, that he liked boys ... so pages were warned to watch out for him.\\" 2000‚Äì2004 On October 9, The Washington Post reported that in 2000, a former page showed Kolbe messages from Foley that made the page feel uncomfortable. According to The Washington Post, these messages were sexually explicit, a characterization that Kolbe's press secretary denied. The Washington Post reported that Kolbe confronted Foley about the messages. Kolbe's press secretary said that unspecified \\"corrective action\\" was taken. Kolbe later said that the former page, whom Kolbe had sponsored, told him of a \\"creepy\\" e-mail from Foley, but did not show it to him. Kolbe said that, through his staff, he passed the complaint on to Trandahl and to Foley's office. Kolbe said that he did not confront Foley about the matter, and that he recalled that the incident had taken place later than 2000. Another page, Matthew Loraditch, stated that when he served in 2001 pages had been warned to \\"watch out for Congressman Mark Foley,\\" though he later softened his description of the warning. Newsweek reported that in 2002 or 2003, Foley showed up at the pages' dormitory after the 10 P.M. curfew, apparently drunk, and attempted to enter the building. He was reportedly turned away by a security guard. Newsweek stated that Trandahl notified Fordham (then Foley's Chief of Staff and later Congressman Tom Reynolds' chief of staff), and that Fordham in turn contacted Scott B. Palmer, Hastert's chief of staff, describing Foley's behavior generally but not mentioning the incident at the pages' dormitory. This account further stated that Fordham followed up a couple of days later with Palmer, who replied that he had \\"informed the Speaker\\" and \\"dealt with it\\" by talking to Foley directly. Testifying under oath before a House ethics committee panel, Fordham said that months before he left Foley's office in January 2004, he had told Hastert's office about the conduct by Mark Foley with male teenage pages. Palmer has categorically denied that meeting between him and Fordham ever took place: \\"What Kirk Fordham says happened did not happen.\\" However, on October 6 a second congressional staffer corroborated Fordham's version of the events, claiming that in 2003 a meeting took place between Palmer and Foley, specifically to discuss complaints about his behavior towards pages. Trandahl, testifying to a closed session of the House Ethics Committee, reportedly also confirmed that Hastert's office was notified of Foley's behavior in 2003. He stated that he regularly updated Hastert's counsel and floor manager, Ted Van Der Meid, about a \\"problem group of members and staff who spent too much time socializing with pages outside of official duties.\\" One member of the group was Foley. 2005‚Äì2006 Representative Rodney Alexander (R-LA) stated that he learned of the five initial e-mails from Foley to the 16 year-old page from Louisiana in the fall of 2005, after a news reporter brought the matter to his attention. Alexander spoke to the boy's parents, who did not wish to pursue the matter beyond stopping the e-mails. Alexander's chief of staff met with Mike Stokke, Hastert's deputy chief of staff in the fall of 2005. They met with Trandahl. Contradictory statements have made it unclear whether they actually read the e-mails. Trandahl then met with Shimkus, and Shimkus and Trandahl met privately with Foley, and Shimkus told him to cease contact with the page. The other two congressional representatives on the House Page Committee (including the only Democrat) were not informed, and no formal investigative or disciplinary action was taken. After testifying in closed session before the House Ethics Committee, Representative Alexander also announced that \\"There are many people who know what we know, and have known it for a lot longer period of time than we've known.\\" He did not name names publicly, however. In the spring of 2006, Representative Alexander mentioned the case to Boehner, who referred him to Representative Reynolds (R-NY), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Both Reynolds and Boehner say that they notified Hastert; he says he can't recall that and questions whether it is true. When the story became public, Hastert said that he had learned of the e-mails only when the news broke in late September 2006. Reynolds said on September 30 that he had spoken with Hastert about the matter early in 2006 after being approached by Alexander to discuss the matter. According to The Washington Post, \\"Republican insiders said Reynolds spoke out because he was angry that Hastert appeared willing to let him take the blame for the party leadership's silence.\\" Hastert's office said that Hastert did not \\"explicitly recall\\" that conversation but said he did not dispute it. Boehner told The Washington Post that he had learned of the emails in the spring. Boehner initially said that he informed Hastert, and that Hastert assured him \\"we're taking care of it.\\" After Hastert denied knowledge to the press, Boehner retracted his statement, stating that he could not recall the conversation. Boehner later stated that he was \\"99 percent\\" sure he had informed Hastert. House Page Board A board consisting of three House members and two congressional staffers, chaired by Shimkus, supervises the House page program. The staffers, who are automatic members, are the House Clerk and the House Sergeant At Arms. Although Shimkus was aware of the five initially reported e-mails in 2005, he did not inform the rest of the board aside from Trandahl. Shimkus said he \\"was asked to keep this in confidence\\" because the parents of the page didn't want the incident publicized. The other two representatives on the board, Dale Kildee (D-MI) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) did not find out about them until the scandal broke in October 2006. Kildee said that he was \\"very upset\\" that he had not been informed of the e-mails. He said, \\"I should have been told. The whole House Page Board should have been told.\\" Capito said that she would have recommended stronger action had she been made aware of the original e-mails. There are separate supervisors for the Republican and Democratic pages. Peggy Sampson has supervised Republican pages since 1986, and several former pages say that she warned them about Mark Foley. Wren Ivester is the supervisor of Democratic pages. No Democratic pages have said they were warned about Foley, and several contacted by ABC News said they had not been told about him. Both supervisors testified before a closed session of the House Ethics Committee on October 11, 2006. On October 16, 2006, the Board held a conference call to discuss allegations in the Kolbe incident in 1996 (discussed above). Role of Leadership members Dennis Hastert Hastert claimed at first that he had learned of the e-mails only when the news broke on September 29, 2006 and repeated this declaration on October 5. Two other top leaders in the House, Boehner and Reynolds, however, have stated that they told Hastert about the Foley emails in the spring of 2006. Boehner added that Hastert replied that the complaint \\"had been taken care of\\", and confirmed his account under oath before the House Ethics Committee. A September 30 statement by the Speaker's office said that Hastert did not \\"explicitly recall\\" the conversation with Reynolds but \\"has no reason to dispute\\" it. Hastert's office concedes, in its own chronology, that his top staffers Mike Stokke (deputy chief of staff), Ted Van Der Meid (legal counsel) and a lower placed assistant named Tim Kennedy were told about the Foley emails by Rep. Alexander's chief of staff in November 2005. They deny that Scott Palmer knew about the emails until they were made public, though. Hastert is unusually close to his top staffers; he lives with Palmer and Stokke, who have worked for him for decades, and they commute back to Illinois together on weekends. Fordham, who had been Foley's chief of staff until January 2004, and chief of staff to Congressman Reynolds from 2005 until he resigned on October 4, 2006, said that he told Scott Palmer about Foley's interest in pages in 2003, that Palmer met with Foley, and that Hastert knew about the meeting. Palmer replied that \\"What Kirk Fordham said did not happen\\", but on October 6 a second congressional staffer corroborated Fordham's account, claiming that a 2003 meeting took place between Palmer and Foley specifically to discuss complaints about his behavior towards pages. At an October 2 press conference, Hastert called the IMs \\"vile and repulsive.\\" He also said that had Foley not resigned, he would have demanded his expulsion from the House. He also condemned Foley for misleading him, Shimkus and the organizations with whom he'd worked to strengthen laws against exploiting children. Hastert requested a criminal investigation of the explicit IMs, but not of the earlier, less explicit e-mails exchanged between Foley and the page sponsored by Alexander. The following day, on The Rush Limbaugh Show Hastert claimed that leadership \\"took care of Mr. Foley. We found out about it and asked him to resign. He did resign.\\" On October 3, the Washington Times called for Hastert's resignation as Speaker over his handling of the scandal. Prominent conservatives also have called for Hastert's resignation, such as David Bossie, president of Citizens United; conservative columnist Richard Viguerie; and conservative columnist Michael Reagan, son of former President Ronald Reagan. Hastert has rebuffed these calls to resign, arguing he did nothing wrong and is committed to investigating the scandal and leading Congress. Boehner also defended Hastert in a letter to the editor of The Washington Times. A conference call on October 2 with about 100 House Republicans had no calls for a resignation. On October 5, Hastert accepted responsibility for the scandal but refused to step down. He said, \\"I haven't done anything wrong\\" and re-affirmed that he had only recently learned about any problems involving Foley and the pages: \\"I learned of this last Friday ... I don't know who knew what or when ‚Äì that's why we've asked for an investigation.\\" Tom Reynolds Reynolds issued a statement that he had spoken with Hastert about the matter early in 2006. According to The Washington Post, \\"Republican insiders said Reynolds spoke out because he was angry that Hastert appeared willing to let him take the blame for the party leadership's silence.\\" Hastert did not \\"explicitly recall\\" that conversation but said he did not dispute it. Reynolds commented on his role in the events, \\"I don't think I went wrong at all ... I don't know what else I could have done.\\" The question of Reynolds's role in the scandal nearly cost him his seat in the November 2006 election. According to conservative columnist Robert Novak, Reynolds convinced a reluctant Foley to run for re-election even after finding out about his questionable e-mails. Reynolds also contributed $5,000 to Foley's re-election fund, apparently after finding out about his behavior., The Daily Politics, Ben Smith, New York Daily News, September 30, 2006 Indeed, Reynolds won reelection by only four percentage points despite representing a district that had been altered specifically to protect him. On October 4, 2006, Fordham, Reynolds's Chief of Staff, resigned after newspapers reported that he had asked ABC News not to report the text of the sexually explicit instant messages. ABC reported that Fordham had offered to give them an exclusive on the resignation if they withheld the text of the IMs. Fordham had previously served as Foley's Chief of Staff. Hastert's spokesman replied, \\"What Kirk Fordham said never happened.\\" It has been reported that prior to the public scandal, Reynolds, together with Karl Rove, urged Foley to run for reelection in 2006, despite Foley's reluctance. John Shimkus Shimkus said \\"that in late-2005 he learned ‚Äì through information passed along by Alexander's office ‚Äì about an e-mail exchange in which Foley asked about the youngster's well-being after Hurricane Katrina and requested a photograph.\\" Shimkus advised Foley not to contact the boy again, and Foley assured him he would not. Shimkus did not share the information with Reps. Kildee or Capito, the other members of the Page Board. Shimkus later described Foley as a \\"slimeball\\", and regretted not pressing further. Unlike Reynolds, he had little difficulty winning re-election. John Boehner Boehner told The Washington Post that he learned of the inappropriate contact in the spring. Boehner initially said that he informed Hastert, and that Hastert assured him \\"we're taking care of it.\\" After Hastert denied knowledge of this conversation, Boehner retracted, saying that he could not recall it. On October 3, Boehner once again recanted, this time telling a radio interviewer \\"I believe I talked to the Speaker and he told me it had been taken care of.\\" Investigations House Ethics Committee Late on September 29, 2006, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) offered a resolution to direct the House Ethics Committee to create a subcommittee to investigate Foley and the Republican leadership. Boehner moved to immediately refer Pelosi's resolution to the Ethics Committee without further debate and the House unanimously agreed. On October 5, 2006, the House Ethics Committee met and established a subcommittee to investigate the page sex scandal. The House subcommittee members are Reps. Doc Hastings (R-WA), Howard Berman (D-CA), Judy Biggert (R-IL), and Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-OH). The subcommittee has already sent subpoenas and has appointed Louis Freeh as a special advisor. The committee opened an expansive investigation into the unfolding scandal on 5 October 2006 by approving nearly four dozen subpoenas for witnesses and documents. The Ethics Committee has no power over Foley, who is no longer a member of Congress. As a result, its chairman has said it will focus on the \\"conduct of House members, officers and staff related to information concerning improper conduct involving members and current and former pages\\". On December 8, 2006, the committee reported the investigation's conclusion, finding Hastert and other Republican leaders negligent, but not in violation of any House rules. The panel did not recommend any sanctions for their failure to stop Foley. The investigation validated Trandahl's and Fordham's reports and concluded that Hastert's chief of staff first learned of Foley's conduct in 2002 or 2003, and that Hastert's chief counsel had been aware of concerns for nearly a decade. Justice Department On October 13, 2006, a Justice Department spokesman confirmed that they had opened a preliminary investigation of the official rafting trip taken in 1996 by Kolbe with two 17 year-old former pages. On October 1, 2006 in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Hastert requested an investigation into Foley's actions, specifically into the explicit IMs that had recently surfaced. Hastert's letter also requested investigation of persons who knew or had possession of these messages but did not report them to the appropriate authorities. That day, the FBI stated that it was assessing whether any federal laws had been violated. On July 21, 2006, the director of the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) received copies of the e-mails from one of her staff members, who had received it two days earlier. On that day, CREW turned over the e-mails to the FBI; however, the FBI found insufficient grounds to open a criminal investigation. After the scandal broke, CREW criticized the FBI's lack of action. An anonymous source in the FBI told the Washington Post that CREW was their original source for the e-mails but had provided only heavily redacted copies, even after a request for complete copies, and would not identify their source. The FBI source also alleged that CREW had held the emails since April before turning them over. However, the department spokesman would not comment on the record. CREW's executive director, Melanie Sloan, replied that they had provided unedited e-mails to the FBI, and that her original e-mails to the FBI proved that. She formally requested that the Justice Department's Inspector General investigate the FBI's assertions. The resulting Inspector General's report concluded that (1) CREW had received the emails in July and turned them over to the FBI within two days; (2) the FBI's decision not to pursue charges against Foley based on the initial emails did not constitute misconduct; but (3) the FBI probably should have referred the case to the House Page Board or other authorities based on what they received. Responses Mark Foley's actions were almost universally condemned. The actions and inactions of Hastert and other members of the Republican House leadership were widely condemned by Democrats and some Republicans. On September 29, 2006, Rep. Pelosi (D-CA) criticized Republican leaders, who, she said, \\"have known of the egregious behavior of Congressman Mark Foley, yet were prepared to adjourn [Congress] tonight without an Ethics Committee investigation.\\" DCCC Chairman Rahm Emanuel noted that Alexander had first gone to Reynolds, who was in charge of political operations, and said, \\"That's to protect a member [of Congress], not to protect a child.\\" When Foley's sexually explicit instant messages became public, a few members of the Republican Party condemned his actions. They voted unanimously with House Democrats to refer the matter to the House Ethics Committee for investigation. Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert also demanded a criminal investigation by writing the Attorney General asking for a full investigation both into Foley's actions and into the possibility that earlier clues were not properly acted upon by Congressional officials, representatives, the media, and the FBI. Some members of the gay community voiced concerns over media coverage of the Mark Foley scandal, since the scandal linked homosexuality and pederasty, while others condemn the media's complicity in permitting Foley to remain closeted. Many Republican candidates have announced that they are either returning contributions from Foley's campaign or contributing any Foley money received in the last several years to charity. The NRCC, however, has opted to keep a $100,000 contribution made to it by Foley in July 2006, after the first, \\"overly friendly\\" e-mails had become known to House Republican leaders. Carl Forti, an NRCC spokesman, has said the campaign organization would gladly accept the $2.7 million campaign war chest that Foley controlled upon his resignation, should Foley choose to turn it over. On October 5, 2006, the parents of the former page from Louisiana, who initially complained about the e-mails to Rep. Alexander, issued a public statement. They described their son's actions as courageous, and described him as a hero for reporting the e-mails. They supported Alexander, calling his conduct \\"beyond reproach\\". They complained about media harassment, and asked to be left alone, requesting respect for their privacy. Political impact Post-scandal polls and commentary A Time poll reported that two-thirds of those aware of the scandal believe that the Republican leadership in Congress attempted a cover- up. According to Fox News, an internal Republican poll conducted in the wake of the scandal shows potentially disastrous election results for Congressional Republicans if Hastert remains as Speaker of the House. The unnamed Republican source is quoted as saying \\"The data suggests Americans have bailed on the speaker, and the difference could be between a 20 seat loss and 50 seat loss.\\" For Democrats to regain control of the House, they had to post a net gain of 15 seats in the 2006 midterm elections. The National Review, a conservative magazine, called the scandal helpful for Democrats campaigning to regain control of one or both houses of Congress, and said it could have a greater impact than the Jack Abramoff scandals since \\"a GOP pederasty scandal\\" is thought to resonate more strongly with the public than one involving the purchase of favors. On October 3, the Washington Times called for Hastert's resignation as Speaker over his handling of the scandal. Other prominent conservatives have called for Hastert's resignation, such as David Bossie, president of Citizens United; conservative columnist Richard Viguerie; and conservative columnist Michael Reagan, a son of former President Ronald Reagan. A Pew Research Center poll released on October 5 indicated no significant change in registered voters' party support; before and after the scandal broke, Democrats had 51 percent support in the upcoming congressional elections, while Republicans had 38 percent support. In later polls, however, Republicans hemorrhaged support; a USA Today/Gallup survey published October 10 showed Democrats enjoying a 23-point advantage over Republicans, with an 11-point gain for Democrats, and a 12-point loss for Republicans, since a poll released on September 17. An October 5, 2006 public opinion poll found that 27% of American thought Hastert should remain Speaker, with 43% thinking he should resign from Congress entirely. On October 6, political scientist and analyst Stuart Rothenberg wrote that the scandal may have helped to \\"set the stage for a blowout of cosmic proportions next month\\" in the November elections. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato, on October 5, wrote in the Crystal Ball that \\"the congressional page scandal [had] joined leaked reports of poor progress in Iraq and Bob Woodward's portrayal of the President Bush as a clueless war wager to deliver Bush and Republicans their worst, most catastrophic week of 2006.\\" Effect in Foley's district In Florida, State Representative Joe Negron was picked to fill Foley's spot in the November elections. The Democratic nominee for the seat was Tim Mahoney. Florida law prohibited Foley's name from being removed from the ballot at the time of his withdrawal from the race, but Republicans hoped that voters would recognize that a vote for Foley would transfer to Negron as a substitute candidate. Nevertheless, Boehner noted that because of the procedures in Florida, \\"to vote for this candidate, you have to vote for Mark Foley. How many people are going to hold their nose to do that?\\" Negron used the slogan, \\"Punch Foley for Joe\\", having the double meaning of officially voting for Foley in order to really elect Negron as well as evoking images of physically striking the offending member of Congress. Foley's Republican-held seat was regarded as unlikely to change hands before the scandal broke, but CQPolitics changed its rating of the race from Safe Republican - where it had stood since July - to Leans Democratic in early-October. On Election Day, Mahoney won the seat. Effect in Reynolds's district Reynolds, the head of the NRCC, who knew of some Foley e-mails before the scandal became public, released an ad apologizing to his constituents. He was thought to have a safe seat. Shortly before the scandal broke, a SurveyUSA poll found Reynolds' Democratic challenger Jack Davis unexpectedly trailing by only two percentage points (43%-45%), a statistical tie. A subsequent SurveyUSA poll taken a week after the first poll show Davis now leading 50-45, outside of either poll's margin of error. A Zogby telephone poll conducted on October 4‚Äì5, after the scandal had been in the news for a week, found Reynolds trailing 33-48. Nevertheless, Reynolds won the race. Effect on other congressional races Within a week of the scandal breaking, five candidates ran campaign ads in reaction to the scandal. Democratic House candidates Patty Wetterling in Minnesota's 6th District, Mary Jo Kilroy in Ohio's 15th, Maxine Moul in Nebraska's 1st district, and Baron Hill in Indiana's 9th came out with ads connecting their opponents to the Republican leadership and, by association, Mark Foley. Page program On October 2, 2006, Representative Ray LaHood (R-IL) called for the page program to be temporarily suspended. He stated that \\"this is a flawed program. The fact that a member of Congress is sending e-mails to a page and that he can get away with it [shows that] obviously there are problems.\\" Two more Representatives, Jon Porter (R-NV) and Kay Granger (R-TX) also supported LaHood's recommendation to suspend the page program until an outside team could evaluate its security protocol. Hastert announced on October 5, 2006 that he was launching an investigation to evaluate and make improvements to the page program. Legal issues Foley, as chair of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, was an expert on law concerning sex with minors. His pursuit of young former pages, in many cases, carefully avoided illegality. Age of consent In the vast majority of states of the United States, the overall age of majority is either 18 years of age or higher. However, age of consent for sex is almost always lower than the overall age of majority, and varies by state (it is 16 in the District of Columbia and 16‚Äì17 in more than 40 other states). The e-mail that first came to light was sent to a 16-year-old former page in Louisiana, where the age of consent is 17. However, the age of consent is relevant only in cases where there has been physical, sexual contact. Foley has not been accused of any such contact with this youth, and has specifically denied sexual contact with any minor through his lawyer. On another occasion he offered a narrower denial of \\"inappropriate sexual contact with a minor\\". The minimum age for House pages is 16. Two former pages have told news organizations that Foley arranged sexual liaisons with them but only after they turned 18 and 21 respectively. On October 19, anonymous law enforcement sources said that FBI interviews with at least 40 former pages involved in the case had not found evidence of any sex crimes by Mark Foley. The FBI identified a pattern where Foley began courting the pages at age 16 or 17 but waited until they turned 18 to have sex. In the state of Florida, the age of consent on the internet and in person is 18. If Foley broke the law in Florida, and is convicted, he would be a sex offender, although the Constitutionality of such a law is probably in dispute in light of issues dealing with interstate commerce and the challenge in having one age of consent law for sex. Sexual communications with minors Legislation that Mark Foley helped enact, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, covers certain Internet communications with minors under 18. Federal law makes it a crime to solicit sex with a minor below the age of consent. However, federal law does not prohibit an individual from engaging in explicit, sexual communications with a minor per se. Some state laws criminalize certain communications with minors, even in the absence of physical sexual contact. In Florida, which Foley represented in Congress, the age of consent is 18 and attempts to seduce a minor are illegal. Louisiana makes it a felony to have sexually explicit communications over the Internet with anyone under 17. California has a law against sending sexually suggestive communications to anyone under 18. The initially publicized explicit IMs were made with two pages or former pages beginning when they were 16 or 17, and continuing until after their 18th birthdays. One of the pages told the FBI that his contacts with Foley led to two meetings, including a dinner in San Diego in October 2002, when the page was 17. After dinner, the page said, Foley invited him back to his hotel room and \\"touched his leg\\", but nothing untoward happened beyond that in a 20-minute visit. Alcohol use In one instant message conversation, Foley appears to invite a minor to his house to consume alcohol. It is unknown if this ever happened, but it is a crime to provide alcohol to a person under the legal drinking age. In the District of Columbia, the law states that \\"anyone who purchases or furnishes alcohol to a [person below the drinking age] faces a fine of up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 180 days.\\" In addition, an individual under the age of 21 is prohibited in the District of Columbia from consuming alcoholic beverages. No charges Almost two years after Foley abruptly resigned over sexually explicit messages he sent to a teenage House page, law enforcement authorities in Florida concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge him with breaking Florida laws.

Despite its untimely release by \\"Division One,\\" an imprint of Atlantic Records, only a week after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the album was hailed by UNCUT magazine as one of the top 20 albums of 2001.Strauss, Neil: \\" Music; Buffeted by Love, and Breathing Hard.\\" \\"The New York Times,\\" May 26, 2002. After Division One folded in October, 2001, Tihista signed with Parasol Records and the group's second album, ‚ÄúJudo,‚Äù was released in 2002. Parasol released the group's third album, ‚ÄúWake Up Captain,‚Äù in 2004. Tihista also recorded with Epicycle during this period performing harmony vocals on the songs \\"Crash\\" and \\"Big Day\\" for Epicycle's 2002 album, ‚ÄúSwirl.‚Äù In 2005, Tihista released a collection of demos and studio tracks without the \\"Red Terror\\" appellation entitled ‚ÄúHome Demons‚Äù with the UK label, Broken Horse. The Broken Horse issue contained 20 tracks (or 21 including the hidden acoustic version of \\"Can I Count On You?\\"). The U.S. version on Parasol contained just 14 tracks (including the exclusive \\"Do You Know What We Should Do Now?\\"). Tihista's work with Tom and Ellis Clark has primarily been in the studio arranging and producing his songs: the three rarely perform live as a band. Instead, on occasion, Tihista has engaged other musicians to perform on the road with him including Randy Diderrich of \\"Sunday Runners\\" and brothers Steve and Gary Vermilion of \\"Pheasant.\\"\\"The Mythical Beast (Blog Interview)\\". July 25, 2004. This incarnation of the band can be heard in one of its rare studio appearances on the song \\"Jim Henson's Blues/You're Not Bad\\" from the album \\"Home Demons.\\" Tihista's solo success has been undercut by harrowing bouts of stage fright. Although he often performed live in front of audiences as the bassist for Triple Fast Action, Tihista appears uncomfortable performing the role of a \\"front man\\" and, consequently, his stage fright has sometimes limited his ability to tour in support of his albums.Harris, Michael: \\"Brit Popular.\\" \\"Chicago Tribune,\\" January 5, 2005. In many music reviews Tihista's music is frequently compared to the work of singer/songwriter Elliott Smith. When interviewed, however, Tihista often seems to resist the comparison and claims he is largely unfamiliar with Smith's work.Fufkin, David: \\"A Few Questions for Kevin Tihista.\\" \\"Fufkin.com,\\" June, 2005. Influences Tihista has acknowledged in interviews include Tears for Fears, the Smiths, Cat Stevens, Bread and America, among others. He has consistently named Tears for Fears' \\"The Hurting\\" as his favorite album. On May 26, 2007, Tihista's MySpace blog announced that he was finishing work on his forthcoming album, \\"Modern Standard\\" with long-time collaborators Tom and Ellis Clark. On July 29, 2009, a message from Kevin Tihista through his UK label Broken Horse appeared on the Drowned in Sound message boards. Kevin reported that he hasn't released anything in a while due to a lack of an American record label, however Broken Horse recently purchased him home recording gear. He has over 100 new songs plus hundreds of stock piled songs with the plan to preview some on YouTube soon. He plans to release a lot of material in 2010. On August 24, 2009, Tihista's MySpace blog announced that he was finishing work on a new album with the running title, \\"On This Dark Street.\\" The recording is apparently the fulfillment of the song collection previously intended for release as \\"Modern Standard,\\" an album title which Tihista now refers to as \\"cursed.\\" Tihista describes the new album as home recorded and stripped down in comparison with his previous releases. The new recording, it appears, will be released on Broken Horse. On 3 December 2009, Broken Horse listed on its blog the titles of over 30 new Kevin Tihista songs that had been recorded. In 2012, Tihista released an album \\"On This Dark Street\\", produced with Ellis Clark. In 2013, Tihista released \\"Modern Standard\\", again produced with Ellis Clark. \\"Modern Standard\\" was released on 29 July 2013 by Broken Horse records and is also available with a limited edition 4 track EP on a CD-R with hand-stamped artwork.

Its hidden lifestyle makes it a rarely seen species. It is the only British mygalomorph spider. The purse-web spider was previously known from Denmark, but as it had not been seen for 60 years despite persistent searching, it was considered extinct. In 1994, it was rediscovered in Jutland.New Danish spider. Natural History Museum of Denmark. University of Copenhagen. Description These spiders are black or brownish and not particularly large; the males are about , while the females are larger at . They look much like Atypus piceus, but spiderlings are often very lightly colored, and the three-part posterior spinnerets do not have a light blot. Like other mygalomorph spiders, it has fangs that point straight down rather than crossing. This spider spins an unusual web. It creates a tube of silk that is hidden partially underground, with the portion above ground being covered in leaves and other debris. The spider waits for an insect to land or crawl onto the tube, then bites through the silk to pull the insect inside. These spiders usually do not leave their webs for any reason other than mating. These spiders become sexually mature at about 4 years. Autumn is the mating season, when the male spiders seek out a female spider and enter her burrow, where they live together until the male dies soon after mating. The female lays her egg sac inside the tube and the spiderlings hatch out the following summer, remaining with their mother for nearly another year after that.

With 500 students from over 43 different countries, ISB is one of the few schools in New England offering the International Baccalaureate. ISB also offers the French Baccalaureate, and all graduating seniors receive the American high school diploma in addition to one of these international diplomas. History The International School of Boston was founded in 1962 as the Jardin d‚ÄôEnfants (literally Children's Garden, French for ‚ÄúKindergarten‚Äù) in hopes of integrating French language and culture into children's educational experiences. The Jardin d‚ÄôEnfants, it was one of the first bilingual programs in the United States. Since 1962 ISB has grown from just 15 children to 500, and expanded to serve TPS through 12th grade. Students range in ages from 2 to 18 and come from 43 nations. The school had a nomadic existence in its early years as it searched for suitable space. From the basement of the Lutheran Church in Belmont, to a church in Newton Corner, to the Armenian Church in Cambridge, to the Parmenter School on Irving Street in Arlington (where the Pre-school and Kindergarten campus has been since 1983), it finally settled in 1997 in its current location in Cambridge. Its main building is the former Cambridge Almshouse, built in 1850 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It also underwent several name changes, including Ecole Bilingue de Boston (French name), and French-American International School of Boston (English name). Since January 2006, the English name has been the International School of Boston. Bilingual education With one of the first bilingual programs in the US, ISB has almost 60 years of experience in bilingual education. ISB's curriculum is bilingual from TPS through 12th grade, with Preschool and Kindergarten being full-immersion programs in French. The International Baccalaureate In addition to the American High School Diploma, ISB offers both the French Baccalaureate and International Baccalaureate (IB). Arts ISB has an extremely strong theater arts program, culminating in a week-long performing arts festival each May. For several years, ISB has participated at the Theater Festival at the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de New York, winning first prize in 2006 and the ‚ÄúSpecial Prize of the Jury‚Äù in 2007. Visual arts also have a week-long festival in May during which student artwork is exhibited. The school choirs have several performances throughout the year. Athletics ISB offers competitive teams in fencing, soccer, basketball and volleyball. In the spring of 2007, ISB hosted the French-American School of Rhode Island and the √âcole Fran√ßaise du Maine in a soccer tournament. ISB has had a competitive Fencing Club for many years, as well as additional clubs for mixed sports, handball, volleyball, and badminton. In January 2013 the ISB varsity men's √©p√©e team finished second at the Massachusetts State Championships with all three of their fencers finishing in the top five individually. Community service All ISB Middle and Upper School students are required to take part in service activities and encouraged to invest their time in creative, active and service-based projects. This helps students develop commitment to an active and healthy lifestyle, recognition of the value of creative and innovative activities, and collaboration, leadership and other skills. Students participate in the Cambridge soup kitchen and the Walk for Hunger, they volunteer within the school and help in the library, serve as homework aides for elementary students, support Open Houses, aid the Parents‚Äô Association with fundraising activities and events. After-School Clubs Clubs include: Math, science, circus arts, knitting, cross-stitch, chess, art, theater, singing, cooking, jazz dance, mime, Spanish, ballet, yoga, video animation, sculpture, jewelry- beading, gardening, and calligraphy. Summer Programs The school offers a summer program for Elementary School ISB and non-ISB students. Non-French and French-speakers are welcome. Activities are run bilingually, so the summer program offers an excellent introduction to French for many students. Activities include art, outdoor games, water games, songs, theater, and a field trip each week. Camp counselors are all ISB teachers‚Äîhighly professional and well experienced. All speak French and English fluently.

They may also conduct extra-legal ceremonies such as naming of babies, renewal of wedding vows and funerals. Officiating at a marriage requires that the celebrant be an authorised marriage celebrant under Australian law, but officiating at extra-legal ceremonies does not. Marriage celebrants Many Western nations permit civil celebrants to perform basic, legal, marriage ceremonies. However Australia was the first nation whose government appointed non-clergy celebrants with the intention of creating ceremonies which aspire to be as culturally enriching and, if required, as formal, as church weddings. That is, civil and religious wedding ceremonies would be of equal cultural status. An \\"authorised celebrant\\" is authorised by the Australian Government to perform legal marriages according to the Marriage Act 1961.MARRIAGE ACT 1961Marriage Amendment Bill 2002 Bills Digest 112 2001‚Äì02 The celebrant may be a representative of a religious organisation (a religious marriage celebrant) or someone providing non-religious weddings (a civil marriage celebrant). In Australia, only authorised (registered) marriage celebrants have the authority to perform marriages. In 2018, 79.7 per cent of Australian marriages were performed by civil celebrants. However, the rate of civil marriages varied between states and territories, with a civil marriage rate of 75.9% in New South Wales, 79.8% in Victoria, 83.7% in Queensland, 78.9% in South Australia, 83.2% in Western Australia, 85.0% in Tasmania, 85.3% in the Northern Territory and 83.4% in the Australian Capital Territory Marriage by independent civil celebrant has spread in other English-speaking countries. Its early establishment in Australia was largely due to the support of the reforming Attorney-General Lionel Murphy in the 1970s.Senator and Mr Justice Lionel Murphy, founder of the civil celebrant movement in Australia, which has now spread to the rest of the Western World Descriptive definition A civil marriage celebrant is authorised by the government to perform legal civil marriages in a dignified and culturally acceptable manner, for those who choose a non-religious ceremony. Civil celebrants also serve people with religious beliefs but who do not wish to be married in a place of worship. In contrast to the established ceremonies of religious or registry office weddings, the couple in celebrant ceremonies make many decisions about the content. Thus, the civil celebrant has the role of a professionally trained ceremony provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client couple. The task may be like an architect who is charged with designing a dream home for a couple who need expert help. In this sense the celebrant is not just the one who performs the ceremony according to law, but its facilitator, the couple's adviser, the resource person, the co-creator of the ceremony, and the rehearsal-director. The celebrant does not come from the standpoint of belief or unbelief. Trained celebrants usually operate professionally on the principle that their own beliefs and values are irrelevant. Motives for reform Major religious affiliations in Australia by census yearCommentators have suggestede.g.Geraldine Doogue (Presenter)- Peter Kirkwood (producer) -Noel Debien (researcher), Secular Soul-Part 2-Ceremonies, Compass Program, Australian Broadcasting Commission (Television- Australia), 30 June 2002, Transcript Retrieved ca.August 2002 the following reasons why civil celebrancy was introduced, and why it succeeded so quickly: *The 1970s in Australia was a time of questioning established institutions and profound social change. *There was great dissatisfaction with the \\"registry office\\" marriages of the time. Couples, who could not or would not use clergy, often found registry office weddings perfunctory, undignified and humiliating. The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, the major denominations at that time, discouraged or forbad remarriage of divorced people; and the offensively dismissive marriages offered by the state in registry offices often seemed designed to add to the distress of couples who were defying their own church's rules.Quote \\"The Catholic partner of a mixed marriage promises to do everything possible to preserve the faith and have all children of the marriage baptised and brought up in the Catholic Church.\\" in the \\"Penny Catechism\\" (Catechism of Christian Doctrine)(1850‚Äì1970) ‚Äì a summary doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. * There was dissatisfaction with the main Christian denominations of the time, especially the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, especially the treatment of divorced persons and of those who chose partners of other denominations (\\"mixed marriages\\"). * There were strong [and sometimes militant] objections to marriage and the marriage ceremony wording by feminists.A number of the feminist writers depicted marriage as a state oppressive to women e.g.Greer, Germaine, quoting Forum Vol 2, no.3, in The Female Eunuch, Paladin, London, 1971 p.199 :see also Segal, Iza, \\"The Immorality of Marriage\\", The Australian Humanist, December 1969, p.7: see also Norma Grieve and Ailsa Burns (eds), Australian Women- Contemporary Feminist Thought, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1994 p.282 * National census figures showed an increasing percentage of people declaring themselves \\"No religion\\".See the excellent graph, entitled \\"Major religious affiliations described in Australian censuses\\" in Christianity in Australia. Note the almost exclusive dominance of Christianity, especially Roman Catholic and Anglican (ca 60%) in Australia in the years 1971‚Äì1976, and the dramatic increase of the No religion/Not stated category to 2011. * Divorces, though common, were expensive, traumatic, and involved legal apportioning of blame. This indirectly tainted the institution of marriage.Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), 2012, p.24ff Origin of civil celebrancy in Australia Mrs Lois D'Arcy was the first independent civil marriage celebrant ever appointed ‚Äî by Attorney-General Lionel Murphy. Her appointment is dated 19 July 1973. This photo illustrates Murphy's radical move in appointing women into a hitherto male dominated profession, and his confidence in young people. Lois D'Arcy was, at the time, a young mother aged 26. Civil celebrancy was established by the Australian Commonwealth Attorney General Lionel Murphy on 19 July 1973, when his first appointee, Mrs Lois D'Arcy, was categorised as a Civil Marriage Celebrant. Later, as civil marriage celebrants branched out into the performance of other ceremonies such as Funerals and Namings the term was shortened to Civil Celebrant. According to civil celebrant Dally Messenger III: > The civil celebrant program is almost entirely the result of one man's > vision. Murphy himself told me the story of how he was opposed by his own > staff, the public service, his fellow members of parliament and officials of > the Labour Party. He defied all, and, on July 19, 1973, in the dead of > night, typed the first appointment himself, found the envelope and stamp, > walked to a post box and posted it himself.> In fact the enabling legislation, the Marriage Act, had been passed in 1961 but Murphy's personal involvement in using the Act's powers and bypassing the bureaucracy made him a hero to the first civil celebrants. Lois D‚ÄôArcy, in a 1992 address to celebrants, recollected Murphy's own account of his authorising the first appointment: > (Lionel had) returned to his office one evening. There he had taken a piece > of paper with his letterhead, typed my authorisation, and then placed it in > an envelope, which he then posted to me. What other person in such a high > position would have done such a thing. No one other than Lionel Murphy! Murphy's stance on marriage reform (and on divorce reform) was part of wider desire to free Australians from restrictive laws. High Court Justice Michael Kirby remarked in 2000: > Lionel Murphy was a big figure on the stage of Australian public life. He > pursued with energy, imagination and determination a vision of Australian > society which was not warped and gnarled and inward-looking. It was one > which reached out to everyone, particularly the disadvantaged.as quoted in > Hocking, Jenny, 1997, Lionel Murphy ‚Äì a Political Biography, Cambridge, > Cambridge UK (and the Bibliography found in Hocking J., 1997) , p.vi.

Lionel Murphy: radical achievements With regard to the marriage celebrant program ‚Äì Dally Messenger III summarised Murphy‚Äôs achievement as follows: > Lionel Murphy was a real radical. I am still amazed at his vision. He > shocked the system. * His first shock to the social system was the > appointment of women ‚Äîat a moment in history when, for hundreds of years, > the only ceremony providers were men. (Paradoxically this Murphy decision is > commonly acknowledged as having substantially supported the women in the > churches who wished to become priests and bishops.) * His second shock to > the social system was the appointment of aborigines as civil celebrants. > Faith Bandler, I recall, was one. (They had only been counted as humans in > the census some six years before.) * His third shock was the appointment of > young people to do ceremonies. Lois D‚ÄôArcy was a 26 year old mother of two > babies. Carol Ditchburn, now Astbury. was 24. * His next shock was that > citizens could choose their own celebrant‚Äîunheard of until then, both with > church and with state. * His next shock, a now obvious truth but still not > fully absorbed, was his assertion that celebrating the milestones of life > was just as important for secular people as it was for religious people. * > His overwhelming conviction was his belief that culture matters ‚Äîreally > matters. According to Messenger and D'Arcy (opera.cit), the pioneer civil celebrants believed they were part of an innovative cultural challenge. They developed a deeper understanding of the purposes of ceremony, and believed celebrants should pursue excellence in every ceremony and in a variety of ceremonies. To raise the general standard of civil ceremonies, given what they saw as the excessively legal cultural context they had inherited, they encouraged each couple to see more creative possibilities in the ceremony than the two of them might originally have envisaged. In this context the celebrant, as a resource person, needed to educate himself/herself in the artistic treasures of western culture appropriate for ceremony creation i.e. in poetry, prose, music, choreography, storytelling and symbolism i.e. the components of ceremony. Since the Federal Government introduced celebrants in 1973, the appointment has been valid at any time, in any place anywhere in Australia. Up to 2013, the Marriage Celebrant Program has enabled over a million couples to be married in civil ceremonies. Celebrants were originally appointed based on geographic location and the perceived need for a celebrant in the area, but after 2003 their appointment was dependent on being a bureaucratically approved \\"fit and proper person\\". Other Western Countries have followed Australia Lionel Murphy and Australia have led the Western world in establishing ceremonies of meaning and substance for secular people. New Zealand in 1977, the United Kingdom ca.1980, and the United States of America in 2002 have followed The Australian model, and have so acknowledged. Celebrant civil ceremonies distinct from civil ceremonies of the past The Code of Practice, a section of the Regulations under the Marriage Act 1961, and to which celebrants are legally bound, requires that celebrants help provide a client-centred ceremony. It further recommends the following high standards of ceremonial preparation and delivery: > * a marriage celebrant must recognise the social, cultural and legal > significance of marriage and the marriage ceremony... * a marriage celebrant > must maintain a high standard of service in his or her professional conduct > and practice... * a marriage celebrant must respect the importance of the > marriage ceremony to the parties and the other persons organising the > ceremony... * give the parties information and guidance to enable them to > choose or compose a marriage ceremony that will meet their needs and > expectations... * If requested by the parties conduct a marriage ceremony > rehearsal... * Ensure that his or her personal presentation is of an > appropriate standard for the marriage ceremony, and respect the expectations > of the parties in relation to the ceremony... * make efforts to ensure that > the marriage ceremony is audible to all those present (using audio > equipment, if required)... * arrive at the venue for the marriage ceremony > no later than the time agreed with the parties... * ensure that the parties > to each marriage receive a level of service that meets their separate and > special requirements... * accept evaluative comment from the parties, and > use any comments to improve performance...Attorney General's Department, > Marriage Regulations 1963, Code of Practice for Marriage Celebrants, > Canberra, Reprint 3 October 27, 2003, pp.122‚Äì123 This distinguishes the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant and the countries which follow the Australian model, from previous experiences of civil marriage, or from pre-conceived notions, often held especially in the UK and the USA that a civil marriage must be short, dry legal and soul-less. As is clear from the Australian Code of Practice quoted above, a couple can, and often do, require that their marriage ceremony have all the traditional structure, content, dress, choreography and flow of a formal church ceremony. And originally, civil celebrants were instructed that the readings, ideals, values, vows, music (lyrics) which are expressed, must be secular and non- religious. In April 1976 the Attorney's General's Department instructed civil celebrants as follows:- > All celebrants are urged to ensure that the ceremony they use is appropriate > for a civil marriage. They are reminded that the service they provide is a > secular alternative to religious services which are reserved for church > marriages.

Dally Messenger III also claims that as the ceremony is either chosen or created by the couple, it can be affirmed as honest and authentic.Messenger III, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney), pp. 16ff Or to give an American perspective on marriage which illustrates a reformed view of civil marriage we need only quote the New Jersey civil marriage celebrant Gerald Fierst: > * A wedding ceremony is a crossroad where two life stories intersect. * A > wedding ceremony takes the two lives that the individuals have travelled and > transforms them into a single path upon which each life embarks, starting > over. * A wedding ceremony acknowledges the turning point, the choice to go > on. * It's the setting off on life's journey together, with the experiences > of the past as a guide into the future. * A wedding ceremony is a story > which tells the past, proclaims the present, and blesses the future.Fierst, > Gerald, The Heart of the Wedding, Parkhurst Brothers, Chicago, 2011, > p.76ffCant, Sally, The Heart and Soul of Celebrancy ‚Äì A Guide to Creating > Memorable Ceremonies, Pennon Publishing, Melbourne 2009 Van Gramberg, Ruth, > The Practical Handbook for Celebrants to Welcome Celebrate and Farewell, > Longueville Books, Woollahra (Australian Marriage Celebrants Inc), 2011, > p.66 Or in the words of Author and Celebrant Wendy Haynes: > When it comes down to it, the jewel in the crown is the wedding ceremony... > The purpose of the book is to inspire you, to give you ideas so you can > shape the ceremony to fit your life and your commitment to each other.Haynes > Wendy, Create Your Own Inspiring Wedding Ceremony, Wendy Haynes, Coffs > Harbour, 2005, pp.1ff Celebrant organisations Lionel Murphy himself founded the first celebrant organisation on 3 May 1974. He called all the celebrants he had appointed to that date to his office in Sydney. He explained to the celebrants who were present that the Labor Party was sure to lose the coming election. Celebrants would need an organisation so that they could speak with one voice, especially if their very existence was threatened by a Conservative (Liberal) Government. He appointed a well-known model Jill-Ellen Fuller as the inaugural President of the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrants Association (ACMCA). He placed his own personal secretary Maureen Barron as temporary secretary but soon officially appointed Dally Messenger III.Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy‚Äôs Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), , p57 (A separate organisation for Funeral Celebrants, the Association of Civil Funeral Celebrants, was formed on 3 May 1977.Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), , p159) Dally Messenger III is an acknowledged leader in the Civil Celebrant Program in Australia, New Zealand and the USA. He has written two influential books, one on secular ceremonies and another on the history of celebrancy. cf. reference 11 & 25\\\\. Apart from survival, the main activities of the ACMCA became to deal with the media, and to distribute and share (by mail) resources among the celebrants i.e. poems and quotations, for use in ceremonies. Murphy exempted every civil celebrant from Section 45 of the Australian federal Marriage Act 1961. This is a legal \\"warning\\" or monitum to the couple. Murphy believed the words to be sexist and inauthentic ‚Äì i.e. wrong for not admitting the high rate of divorce. After several years the ACMCA broke up into state organisations. Other organisations such as the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants formed (28 January 1994) which admitted marriage, funeral and naming celebrants.Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy‚Äôs Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), , p207 The fixed-fee period: 1974‚Äì1995 Despite a number of difficulties and problems, the civil celebrant program turned out to be hugely popular with the general public. From 1973 to 1995, civil marriages by independent celebrants went from 2.92% of total marriages to 38.5% in 1996.(If one includes Total Civil Marriages i.e. includes civil marriages performed by government \\"Registry Office\\" officials, total civil marriages went from 17.92% in 1974 to 46.7% in 1996Australian Bureau of Statistics, Year Book of Australia 1996, AGPS, Canberra. 1997 p.151 and Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996 Marriages and Divorces Australia, Cat.No.3310.0, 1997, ABS, Canberra The main problem was the fixed fee which, strictly interpreted by Attorney-General‚Äôs Department ultimately led to a serious decline in standards from which the program has never fully recovered.An example of these declining standards there were many news reports e.g. The Sunday Observer (Melbourne),, 13 January 1980, Bride and Groom \\"Jilted\\" by celebrant Once the pioneer celebrants became diluted with new appointments idealism was only sustained by the minority. Attitudes developed with many celebrants which turned out to be very destructive. Realising they received the same remuneration if they spent time and care in the preparation of a marriage, or if they did not, many provided the absolute minimum for the marrying couple. To make matters worse, the fixed fee, in a period of high inflation, declined in value, which further exacerbated the problem. Many good celebrants were forced out of the field due to the low remuneration. In the context of the fixed fee, those who stayed practising marriage celebrants did far too many marriages to earn enough remuneration for their personal needs. Despite Lionel Murphy‚Äôs clear declarations to the contrary, some powerful public servants began to classify the office of marriage celebrant as a \\"community service\\" which led to a further deterioration of professional standards. Says Messenger: > ‚Ä¶ the public service and the government had all but destroyed the Civil > Marriage Celebrant Program by freezing the fee, forcing down standards and > frustrating the good celebrants out of the business.Messenger III, Dally > (2012), Murphy‚Äôs Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil > Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), Chapter 42 Despite these debilitating policy initiatives, a minority core of celebrants sustained high standards. The program continued to progress and, at the end of 1995, was very close to becoming the mainstream procedure of contracting marriage. Deregulation period: 1995‚Äì2003 According to MessengerMessenger, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), , Chapters 43‚Äì48 the period from 1995 to 2003 is recorded as being the most happily productive of the Civil Celebrant Movement in Australia. Funeral and Naming ceremonies, originally opposed by the majority of celebrants and the Attorney-General's Department, had gradually and imperceptibly become accepted. A group of celebrants under the leadership of Rick Barclay, a successful Funeral and Marriage Celebrant, had morphed the original Funeral Celebrants Association of Australia into an organisation which accepted all ceremonies and celebrants into an inclusive association titled The Institute of Australian Celebrants. Kathleen Hurley, an active member of the Institute, persuaded Dally Messenger III to become more deeply involved. Other activists at this time included Ken Woodburn, Lyn Knorr, Beverley Silvius, Gavan Grosser, Cavell Ferrier and Brian and Tina McInerney. As a group, they decided to escalate the profile of the Institute and take a lead in bringing all celebrants together. They also devised a plan for regular meetings and conferences to encourage co-operation, professional development, and to focus on a deeper understanding of the role of the celebrant in society.Newsletter of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, No. 01 to No 14. 29 March 1994, to 1 January 1996 Their most important decision was to mount a political and media campaign to abolish the fixed fee, perceived as the cause of the lowest standards since the program was established. With these ends, on 28 January. 1994, the institute became a national organisation, the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants Inc. Before challenging government, they campaigned for more members and organised a series meetings and seminars. Shortly after, on 28 March 1994 Dally Messenger, the president of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants joined with Robert Ross, secretary of the Association of Civil Marriage Celebrants of Victoria in a meeting with the Honorable Peter Duncan, the assistant minister in charge of celebrants, and asked him for the deregulation of the fee for marriages, and a number of other reforms. Duncan, after several months of correspondence, responded negatively by appointing 1000 extra celebrants.Lambert, Catherine, Sunday Herald Sun, 5 Feb 1995, Warning Bells in 'glut' of Celebrants, and Newsletter of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, No. 01 to No 14. 29 March 1994, to 1 January 1996 This provocative action galvanised all eleven celebrant organisations to challenge the government via the media. With the assistance of leading constitutional lawyer, Professor Michael Pryles, and the abovementioned media publicity, the government responded. The fixed fee was de-regulated on 1 July 1995. On 29 & 30 August 1995 the federal government invited representatives of all eleven celebrant organisations to a meeting in Canberra ‚Äî the National Council of Celebrants. More importantly, a search conference, initiated by public servant, Helen Eastburn, was set up to establish Competency Standards under Jan Wallbridge and Jennifer Rivers of the Canberra Institute of Technology. This occurred on 29 and 30 August 1995 and was followed through and refined in intense correspondence and phone calls to everyone concerned in the weeks following. A watershed of development and possibly symbolically expressing the most profound maturing within the celebrant movement were the series of conferences held at Pallotti College, Millgrove, northeast of Melbourne from 1994 to 1999. The committee of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants decided that the Conferences should explore the nature of celebrancy itself and focus primarily on ceremony and ritual in society.Celebrations, Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, No. 15 to No.40, January 1996 to June 2000 Review of 2003: 2003‚Äì2013 Graph tracing the success of the civil marriage celebrant program in Australia from 1969 to 2004.Sometime in 1998 Civil weddings became more than 50% of all weddings performed in Australia.Thirty years later, following an extensive review and the introduction of reforms by the federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams, the marriage celebrant system changed. Williams promised a new structure and summarised his intentions as follows: > * quality training for celebrants * a careful selection process for the > appointment of marriage celebrants * a balancing of the number of celebrants > appointed * a Code of Practice which required careful attention to couples > and their ceremonial needs * precise attention to the requirements of laws > and procedures.Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy‚Äôs Law and the Pursuit of > Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, > Melbourne (Australia), p.272 Since September 2003, prospective marriage celebrants have had to undergo Government-approved, accredited training in marriage celebrancy, and meet specific criteria set by the Attorney-General's Department to be declared a \\"fit and proper person\\" to hold the office of \\"marriage celebrant\\". In this same month a series of legal and administrative changes to the civil celebrant program were put into effect by the Australian Government. Attorney-General Daryl Williams, who left the Australian Parliament in mid-term had, just before he resigned, approved a number of radical changes to the Marriage Act and the Regulations under the Act (Section 39 as it was, and after 2003). The most important of these was the legal transfer of powers over the program from the Attorney-General to an appointed public servant titled \\"The Registrar\\".from 1961 to 2003, Section 39 (2) of the Marriage Act read simply as follows : \\"The Minister may, by instrument in writing, authorise ‚Ä¶ other fit and proper persons to solemnize marriages.\\" cf. Marriage Act 1961 as found in Handbook for Marriage Celebrants, Attorney General‚Äôs Department, Australian Government Publishing Services, Canberra, 1992. When the powers were transferred to the Registrar (public servant), several pages were added to the Act specifying those powers in detail; i.e., \\"Section 39 A to M\\" as found in The Marriage Act 1961, Reprint 5, Attorney General‚Äôs Department, Canberra, 2003, .). The program, from its beginnings in 1973 had always been referred to as the \\"Civil Celebrant Program\\". Under the 2003 changes, all civil celebrant appointments were cancelled, and all civil celebrants to this point were re- appointed by the Registrar, in the same category as clergy of small churches, as \\"Commonwealth Authorised Celebrants\\".Section 39 of The Marriage Act 1961, Reprint 5, Attorney General‚Äôs Department, Canberra, 2003, . New appointments were usually authorised by the Registrar after passing one Unit of Competency, of a since substantially discredited educational system of Nationally Authorised Training.e.g. Sophie Cuttriss, The Age, Melbourne, 12 August 2011; Australian Broadcasting Commission, 7:30 Report (TV), of 7 August 2012, 8 August 2012, 9 August 2012 and 5 September 2012; and Peter Crocker, Mary Colrain, Jeff Larson, and Sue McKerracher in The Age (Melbourne) Letters, 17 February 2013. With a pass in this UnitUnit of Competency, CHCMCEL401A, Plan, Conduct, and Review a Marriage Ceremony certified by any Registered Training Organisation, on application to the Registrar, providing the applicant paid attention to the details of the written application, appointment as a Commonwealth Authorised Celebrant was more or less automatic, with the occasional exception. This system led to a proliferation of celebrants and excessive competition. It also led to a lowering of standards. In 2010, Melbourne journalist Mark Russell noted: > There are thousands of (rookie marriage celebrants) trying to undercut each > other in the race down the aisle. Since federal laws were introduced seven > years ago dispensing with the policy of appointing celebrants on a needs- > only basis ... the number of Celebrants has tripled to more than 10,000 ... > many have inadequate training... The number of nuptial nightmares is soaring > ... horror stories abound ... inexperienced celebrants have been accused of > ruining wedding days because they don't know what they are doing. The article goes on to list the disastrous experience of many wedding days, the inadequacy of celebrant training, unpredictable cancellations by celebrants, the lowering of planning and rehearsing standards, the indignity of some celebrant advertising material and the \\"savage\\" over-competition. On 15 January 2012, in an open letter to Attorney-General Nicola Roxon, nine senior celebrants protested their grievances at the deterioration of the program in which they had formerly felt pride and achievement. They listed:- * The downgrading of status by the legal transfer of ministerial authority to a public servant. * The setback to the high cultural standards they had worked for years to attain. * The loss of identity in legally excluding the title \\"civil celebrant\\". * The confusion of the general public as to who was a \\"religious\\" celebrant and who was not. * The disrespect shown by the Registrar ‚Äì especially to those who pioneered the program. * The excessive number of celebrants and the consequent lowering of standards. They recommended a policy based on the following principles. *quality training for celebrants, *a careful selection process for the appointment of marriage celebrants, *a balancing of the number of celebrants appointed, and a *Code of Practice which requires careful attention to couples (and other clients) and their ceremonial needs, and *precise and correct attention to the requirements of laws and procedures. Statistics Until 2004 the Commonwealth Statistician (ABS- ref) customarily gave statistics for the * Number of civil marriages by government registry offices * Number of marriages performed by Independent civil marriage celebrants. * Number of marriages by each of the major churches and religions. * Number of marriages by smaller denominations (total). After 2004 many of these statistics were discontinued. Statistics for the total number and proportion of religious and civil marriages are still published each year, but they do not distinguish between marriages conducted by registry office officials and those conducted by independent marriage celebrants. Similarly, statistics of religious marriages only give separate figures for the two largest denominations, Roman Catholics and Anglicans. Celebrant training and education Until 1994, Celebrant Training was mainly achieved by informal but effective mentoring of new celebrants by the more experienced. This was augmented by seminars and conferences organised by the main celebrant organisations. Significant progress in understanding of the celebrant role was achieved at the annual \\"Pallotti\\" live-in conferences which took place at Warburton in Victoria from 1994 to 1999. International lecturers included Mary Hancock from New Zealand and David Oldfield from Washington DC in the US. Mary Hancock, Pioneer New Zealand Civil Celebrant (New Zealand adopted the Australian Model). Mary Hancock established the first training course for civil celebrants in the world in Auckland New Zealand (ca.1994). In 1994, the first formal training course for civil celebrants ever established, was created by pioneer civil celebrant Mary Hancock in Auckland, New Zealand. Shortly after, in Australia, the International College of Celebrancy courses were established by Dally Messenger III.Messenger, Dally, Murphy's Law, op cit. pp. 231-259. After the changes of 2003, the Australian Government encouraged Registered Training Organisations to teach celebrancy, a system which was open to exploitation by unethical operators and which for civil celebrants, and for many other vocational training courses, proved disastrous.Tomazin, Farrah, \\"Skills Training Hits Bottom\\". The Age (front page story), Melbourne, 5 April 2015. Registration Registration provides the legal authority to practice as a marriage celebrant and a four-digit or five- digit alpha-numeric registration number. Once registered (or authorised as it is also known), the marriage celebrant can marry couples in virtually any location (e.g. reception centre \\"chapels\\", other de-consecrated chapels and churches, historic buildings, galleries, private homes, parks and gardens, beaches, headlands, boats etc.) and at any time of the day or night. The celebrant is responsible for processing and lodging all legal paperwork to register the marriage in accordance with defined procedures. This gives the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant more status than they enjoy in other western countries, but also additional legal responsibility.Messenger, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney), . p.3Messenger, Dally (2012). Murphy‚Äôs Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement. Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), . pp.199‚Äì205 Funeral and general celebrants From 1975 a defined group of marriage and non-marriage celebrants declared themselves as Funeral Celebrants. Many celebrants who are currently awaiting appointment as marriage celebrants and who cannot yet perform marriage ceremonies are practising as general celebrants in the community. Authorised marriage celebrants also frequently offer general celebrant services; but since these services are extra-legal, they may also be conducted on an ad hoc basis by untrained people. General celebrants perform a range of different extra-legal ceremonies including naming (namegiving) ceremonies;Haynes, Wendy, How to Create an Inspiring Naming Ceremony, Boolarong Press, Salisbury-Brisbane- Australia, 2007, funerals; renewal of wedding vows; anniversaries; significant birthday celebrations; commitment ceremonies for same-sex couples who were forbidden to marry under Australian law (marriage equality became legal in Australia in December 2017), or for heterosexual couples who cannot marry for personal, financial, religious or legal reasons; memorials and or scattering of ashes ceremonies; boat-naming ceremonies; dedication of new home or office ceremonies; graduation ceremonies; naturalisation (citizenship) ceremonies; becoming a teenager (coming of age) and other ceremonies.

Data diodes can be found most commonly in high security environments, such as defense, where they serve as connections between two or more networks of differing security classifications. Given the rise of industrial IoT and digitization, this technology can now be found at the industrial control level for such facilities as nuclear power plants, power generation and safety critical systems like railway networks. After years of development the use of data diodes have increased creating two variations: *Data diode: Network appliance or device allowing raw data to travel only in one direction, used in guaranteeing information security or protection of critical digital systems, such as industrial control systems, from inbound cyber attacks. *Unidirectional gateway: Combination of hardware and software running in proxy computers in the source and destination networks. The hardware, a data diode, enforces physical unidirectionality and the software replicates databases and emulates protocol servers to handle bi-directional communication. The unidirectional gateway is capable of transferring multiple protocols and data types simultaneously. It contains a broader range of cybersecurity features like, secure boot, certificate management, data integrity, forward error correction (FEC), secure communication via TLS, among others. A unique characteristic is that data is transferred deterministically (to predetermined locations) with a protocol \\"break\\" that allows the data to be transferred through the data diode. Data diodes are commonly found in high security military and government environments, and are now becoming widely spread in sectors like oil & gas, water/wastewater, airplanes (between flight control units and in-flight entertainment systems), manufacturing and cloud connectivity for industrial IoT. New regulations have increased demand and with increased capacity, major technology vendors have lowered the cost of the core technology.  History  The first data diodes were developed by governmental organizations in the eighties and nineties. Because these organizations work with confidential information, making sure their network is secure is of the highest priority. Primary solutions used by these organizations were air gaps. But, as the amount of transferable data increased, and a continuous and real-time data stream became more important, these organizations had to look for an automated solution. In the search for more standardization, an increasing number of organizations started to look for a solution that was a better fit for their activities. Commercial solutions created by stable organizations succeeded given the level of security and long-term support. In the United States, utilities and oil and gas companies have used data diodes for several years, and regulators have encouraged their use to protect equipment and processes in SISs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now mandates the use of data diodes and many other sectors, in addition to electrical and nuclear, also use data diodes effectively. In Europe, regulators and operators of several safety-critical systems started recommending and implementing regulations on the use of unidirectional gateways. In 2013 the working, Industrial Control System Cybersecurity, directed by the French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI) stated that is forbidden to use firewalls to connect any class 3 network, such as railway switching systems, to a lower class network or corporate network, only unidirectional technology is permitted.

While use of these devices is common in high security environments such as defense, where they serve as connections between two or more networks of differing security classifications, the technology is also being used to enforce one-way communications outbound from critical digital systems to untrusted networks connected to the Internet. The physical nature of unidirectional networks only allows data to pass from one side of a network connection to another, and not the other way around. This can be from the \\"low side\\" or untrusted network, to the \\"high side\\" or trusted network, or vice versa. In the first case, data in the high side network is kept confidential and users retain access to data from the low side.Slay, J & Turnbull, B 2004, 'The Uses and Limitations of Unidirectional Network Bridges in a Secure Electronic Commerce Environment', paper presented at the INC 2004 Conference, Plymouth, UK, 6‚Äì9 July 2004 Such functionality can be attractive if sensitive data is stored on a network which requires connectivity with the Internet: the high side can receive Internet data from the low side, but no data on the high side are accessible to Internet-based intrusion. In the second case, a safety-critical physical system can be made accessible for online monitoring, yet be insulated from all Internet-based attacks that might seek to cause physical damage. In both cases, the connection remains unidirectional even if both the low and the high network are compromised, as the security guarantees are physical in nature. There are two general models for using unidirectional network connections. In the classical model, the purpose of the data diode is to prevent export of classified data from a secure machine while allowing import of data from an insecure machine. In the alternative model, the diode is used to allow export of data from a protected machine while preventing attacks on that machine. These are described in more detail below.  One-way flow to less secure systems  Involves systems that must be secured against remote/external attacks from public networks while publishing information to such networks. For example, an election management system used with electronic voting must make election results available to the public while at the same time it must be immune to attack.Douglas W. Jones and Tom C. Bowersox, Secure Data Export and Auditing Using Data Diodes, Proceedings of the 2006 USENIX/ACCURATE Electronic Voting Technology Workshop, 1 August 2006, Vancouver. This model is applicable to a variety of critical infrastructure protection problems, where protection of the data in a network is less important than reliable control and correct operation of the network. For example, the public living downstream from a dam needs up-to-date information on the outflow, and the same information is a critical input to the control system for the floodgates. In such a situation, it is critical that the flow of information be from the secure control system to the public, and not vice versa.  One-way flow to more secure systems  The majority of unidirectional network applications in this category are in defense, and defense contractors. These organizations traditionally have applied air gaps to keep classified data physically separate from any Internet connection. With the introduction of unidirectional networks in some of these environments, a degree of connectivity can safely exist between a network with classified data, and a network with an Internet connection. In the Bell- LaPadula security model, users of a computer system can only create data at or above their own security level. This applies in contexts where there is a hierarchy of information classifications. If users at each security level share a machine dedicated to that level, and if the machines are connected by data diodes, the Bell-Lapadula constraints can be rigidly enforced.Curt A. Nilsen, Method for Transferring Data from an Unsecured Computer to a Secured Computer, U.S. Patent 5,703,562, 30 December 1997.  Benefits  Traditionally, when the IT network provides DMZ server access for an authorized user, the data is vulnerable to intrusions from the IT network. However, with a unidirectional gateways separating a critical side or OT network with sensitive data from an open side with business and Internet connectivity, normally IT network, organizations can achieve the best of both worlds, enabling the connectivity required and assuring security. This holds true even if the IT network is compromised, because the traffic flow control is physical in nature. *No reported cases of data diodes being bypassed or exploited to enable two-way traffic. *Lower long-term operating cost (OPEX) cost as there are no rules to maintain. Although there will be software updates to be installed. Often these devices need to be maintained by the vendors. *The unidirectional software layer cannot be configured to allow two- way traffic due to the physical disconnection of the RX or TX line.  Weaknesses  *As of June 2015, unidirectional gateways were not yet commonly used or well understood. *Unidirectional gateways are unable to route the majority of network traffic and break most protocols. *Cost; data diodes were originally expensive, although lower cost solutions are now available. *Specific use cases that require a two-way data flow can be difficult to achieve.  Variations  The simplest form of a unidirectional network is a modified, fiber-optic network link, with send and receive transceivers removed or disconnected for one direction, and any link failure protection mechanisms disabled. Some commercial products rely on this basic design, but add other software functionality that provides applications with an interface which helps them pass data across the link. All-optical data diode links can present channel capacity greater than their driving electronics. In 2019, Controlled Interfaces demonstrated one-way optical link connectivity using optical fibers and 100G Commercial Off The Shelf transceivers. Other more sophisticated commercial offerings enable simultaneous one-way data transfer of multiple protocols that usually require bidirectional links. The German companies INFODAS and GENUA have developed software based (\\"logical\\") data diodes that use a Microkernel Operating system to ensure unidirectional data transfer. Due to the software architecture these solutions offer higher speed than conventional hardware based data diodes. In 2018, Siemens Mobility released an industrial grade unidirectional gateway solution in which the data diode, Data Capture Unit, uses electromagnetic induction and new chip design to achieve an EBA safety assessment, guaranteeing secure connectivity of new and existing safety critical systems up to Safety integrity level (SIL) 4 to enable secure IoT and provide data analytics and other cloud hosted digital services. The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has developed its own unidirectional network called the Networkhttp://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/chacs/sites/edit- www.nrl.navy.mil.itd.chacs/files/files/networkPumpBrochure_0.pdf Pump. This is in many ways similar to DSTO's work, except that it allows a limited backchannel going from the high side to the low side for the transmission of acknowledgments. This technology allows more protocols to be used over the network, but introduces a potential covert channel if both the high- and low- side are compromised through artificially delaying the timing of the acknowledgment.Myong, HK, Moskowitz, IS & Chincheck, S 2005, 'The Pump: A Decade of Covert Fun' Different implementations also have differing levels of third party certification and accreditation. A cross domain guard intended for use in a military context may have or require extensive third party certification and accreditation. A data diode intended for industrial use, however, may not have or require third party certification and accreditation at all, depending on the application.

Route description NY 223 begins at an intersection with NY 13 and County Route 68 (Old Ithaca Road) in the town of Horseheads. It progresses to the southeast as Breesport Road, passing a local mobile home park, which leads to a stretch of standalone homes in the middle of otherwise undeveloped fields. This backdrop follows NY 223 for a distance as it winds its way through Horseheads. However, the alignment straightens out as it enters the hamlet of Breesport. Through Breesport, the highway passes by closely spaced residences and commercial businesses as it becomes Main Street for a short distance. In downtown Breesport, NY 223 intersects with the northern terminus of CR 1 (Church Street) before curving southeast and out of town. The backdrop initially remains similar to the way the route entered Breesport, namely a mix of fields and residential homes; however, the highway soon bends to the northeast and enters the rural town of Erin. NY 223 eastbound heading through Swartwood Hill The road continues its slow northeastern progression until a fork at CR 37 (Fairview Road), where it darts northeastward at a shorter angle. NY 223 soon turns eastward, entering the hamlet of Erin. In Erin, it serves the southern terminus of CR 38 (Laurel Hill Road) and soon turns northward on a right-of- way served by CR 4 (Marsh Road). NY 223 soon leaves Erin and becomes known as Swartwood Hill Road, as which it turns to the northeast through fields, residences and woods. After the intersection with Drake Road, the route rises in elevation using switchbacks up Swartwood Hill, where the alignment heads through a dense wooded area. After winding its way out of the forest, NY 223 ends up in the town of Van Etten and its hamlet of Swartwood. There, the route turns eastward on a right-of-way taken from CR 14 (Swartwood Road). At an intersection with nearby CR 24 (Decker Road), NY 223 darts northeast to cross a railroad alignment and reach its east end at an intersection with NY 224. History The east‚Äìwest highway between the town of Horseheads and the village of Candor by way of the villages of Van Etten and Spencer was originally designated as NY 53 in the mid-1920s. NY 53 was renumbered to NY 223 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 223 was truncated to its junction with NY 224 northwest of Van Etten in the early 1950s. The former routing of NY 223 southeastward to Van Etten became an extension of NY 224 while the Spencer‚ÄìCandor portion became a realignment of NY 96\\\\. From Van Etten to Spencer, the road remained part of NY 34, which NY 223 had overlapped.

From standing, sweeps are throws or takedowns that primarily use the legs to attack an opponent's legs. On the ground, sweeps are techniques for reversing a grappling position.  Standing  When standing it is a technique used to take an opponent to the ground by knocking their legs out from under them, so is classed as a throw or takedown. The force of the sweep either runs perpendicular to the opponent's leg or rises as it strikes the leg, lifting the foot from the ground. A sweep can be used to take the opponent to the ground or it can simply disrupt the opponent's balance long enough to make an opening for a punch or kick. In Japanese it is known as ashi-barai.

Push Sweep A Push Sweep is one of the guard sweeps described in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The main characteristic of the Push Sweep is the practitioner pushing the opponent's knee out from under them with their foot, when the practitioner has the opponent in their open guard. The Push Sweep is similar to the Scissor Sweep, which uses a scissor motion of the legs to sweep the opponent, but adds the detail of pushing the opponent's knee out from under them. This additional detail is required when the opponent keeps a wide base to prevent the Scissor Sweep.cite web |url=http://www.ultimatejujitsu.com/learn-jujitsu-techniques/brazilian-jiu- jitsu-techniques/transitions/push-sweep/ |title=PUSH SWEEP - BRAZILIAN JIU- JITSU |website=Ultimate Jiu Jitsu |publisher=Ultimate Jiu Jitsu |access- date=April 25, 2020 |quote= Just as with the Scissor Sweep, you lay your left leg next to your opponents right knee.

Other problems associated with product proliferation include higher production, higher inventory and larger record-keeping costs. The very dynamism of product proliferation makes it hard to manage.

History  Parle Agro is an offshoot of Parle Products, which was founded in 1929 in British India. It was owned by the Chauhan family of Vile Parle, Mumbai. The original Parle company was split into three separate companies owned by the different factions of the original Chauhan family: * Parle Products, led by Vijay, Sharad and Raj Chauhan (owner of the brands Parle-G, Melody, Mango Bite, Poppins, Kismi Toffee Bar, Monaco and Krack Jack) * Parle Agro, led by Prakash Chauhan and his daughters (owner of the brands such as Frooti and Appy) * Parle Bisleri, led by Ramesh Chauhan All three companies continue to use the family trademark name \\"Parle\\". Separation from the parent company Logo utilised before 2019 Parle Agro commenced operations in 1984. It started with beverages, and later diversified into bottled water (1993), plastic packaging (1996) and confectionery (2007). Frooti, the first product rolled out of Parle Agro in 1985, became the largest selling mango drink in India. The original Parle group was amicably segregated into three non-competing businesses. But a dispute over the use of \\"Parle\\" brand arose, when Parle Agro diversified into the confectionery business, thus becoming a competitor to Parle Products. In February 2008, Parle Products sued Parle Agro for using the brand Parle for competing confectionery products. Later, Parle Agro launched its confectionery products under a new design which did not include the Parle brand name. In 2009, the Bombay High Court ruled that Parle Agro can sell its confectionery brands under the brand name \\"Parle\\" or \\"Parle Confi\\" on condition that it clearly specifies that its products belong to a separate company, which has no relationship with Parle Products.  Parle Agro brands  Parle Agro Pvt. Ltd operates under three major business verticals: * Beverages ‚Äì fruit drinks, nectars, juice, sparkling drinks * Water ‚Äì packaged drinking water * Foods ‚Äì confectionery, snacks Parle Agro also diversified into production of PET preforms (semi-finished bottles) in 1996.

The plotters aimed to overthrow the constitutional government and establish a Military Rule in Pakistan. The plot was foiled after intelligence agencies tipped off the Pakistan Army. History Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party won the 1988 general election after Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's 11-year Dictatorship came to an abrupt end with his death. Previous Attempt In 1989 members of the ISI (Pakistan Army's intelligence and espionage agency) were exposed in a sting operation as wanting to overthrow the government of Benazir Bhutto. Major Amir, the co conspirator of the notorious Operation Midnight Jackal said he liked Sharif as a political leader and wanted to make Mr.Sharif the new Prime Minister. He said Sharif was a part of his political camp and would continue the agenda of Zia-ul-Haq, the person who had launched Sharifs political careers and given his party access to public funds.  Causes  With accusations of corruption in the country and particularly in the government circles, a level of discontent had grown in various circles. UN sanctions designed to stop Pakistan's nuclear programme also began to affect the wider economy. Officers who had been recruited under Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation were very pro nuclear Pakistan, and wanted to continue the Nuclear Program, which was considered to be stopped by Benazir after deal with USA. Gen. Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation policies launched in the 1980s vastly increased the role of Deobandi Islam in public life. General Zia encouraged Fundamentalist Islamic law and religious education in all segments of Pakistani society to build his legitimacy (which had become weak after he had overthrown a popular elected leader and had suspended democracy) on being a good Muslim ruler. Resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was hailed as a religious duty and Pakistani intelligence and military services, with the help of the CIA, recruited, trained and armed Afghan mujahideen to fight the Soviet Army. In the process a vast network of madrases and hardline mosques were established. Later this network would be used to keep Zia-ul-Haq in power and suppress Democracy, leading to the much greater problem of religious extremism and terrorism in Pakistan.  Plot  The main accused in this failed coup attempt were Major General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, Brigadier Mustansir Billa and Qari Saifullah.http://www.criminology.edu.pk/crimenews.html . While Brigadier Billah was assumed to be the ideologue of the group, the main executor was supposed to be Qari Saifullah.http://www.dawn.com/2008/03/04/top18.htm Major General Abbasi was serving at the time as director-general of infantry corps at the Pakistani army high command in Rawalpindi. With the help of sympathetic military officers, the group allegedly began plotting against the civilian government of Benazir Bhutto and the army chief Gen. Abdul Waheed Kakar. It was claimed that they planned to assassinate Bhutto, Kakar, senior cabinet ministers and the military chiefs to bring about a corruption free government in Pakistan. Acting on a tip-off from the then Maj. Gen. Ali Kuli Khan Khattak, who was then the director-general of military intelligence (DGMI), the then chief of general staff (CGS) Lt. Gen. Jehangir Karamat, who later became the Chief of the Army Staff suppressed the coup by arresting 36 army officers and 20 civilians in Rawalpindi and the capital Islamabad. Qari Saifullah saved himself by becoming an \\"approver\\" (government witness) on behalf of the prosecution during the trial. Based on this deal, Qari Saifullah was given freedom in 1996 and did not face a trial. Without his testimony, it would not have been possible to convict the other officers. While Qari Saifullah gained his freedom, the other alleged co-conspirators were convicted.http://www.rantburg.com/poparticle.php?D=2008-09-24&ID;=250849 Other views Professor Lawrence Ziring, former president of the American Institute of Pakistani studies offered a different view of events. In his 2003 book, \\"Pakistan at the cross currents of history\\", Ziring said there was \\"little evidence to implicate the accused\\" (p. 239). He also suggested that the alleged coup was little more than an attempt by Bhutto to bring the military establishment closer under her control. (p. 239) He also describes Bhutto as lashing out against her critics in November 1995 and accusing (without proof) those involved as having planned to kill her, most of the army command and the president of Pakistan.  Aftermath  Benazir Bhutto was succeeded in 1997 by Nawaz Sharif, who would dismiss army chief Gen. Karamat and Lt. Gen. Khattak. Sharif maintained links with Hardline Islamic groups like Tableeghi Jamaat and provided financial support for the group. He also helped Muhammad Rafiq Tarar ‚Äì an unknown person in the public domain a supporter of Tableeghi Jamaat ‚Äì become the President of Pakistan. The alleged plotters were convicted by a military court and awarded different sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years. The highest sentence was given to Brigadier BiLLAH (14 years). Major Gen. Abbasi was given a 7-year term in jail. His imprisonment started in 1995 and he was to remain in prison until 2002 (7 years). During his period of imprisonment, Abbasi lodged an appeal to Supreme Court of Pakistan in 1997 for a review of his case. This was refused since he had been convicted by a military court, and it was outside the purview of civilian courts. He was not granted release. However based on good conduct during his prison term, Abbasi was given early release from prison by General Pervez Musharraf in October 1999, i.e. within four years. With his military career over, Abbasi moved to organise a political party with the aim of creating awareness and establishing a Hardline Sunni Islamic law through peaceful parliamentary legislation . Later Abbasi formed another political party called the Azmat-e-Islam party with the same objectives. He led a quiet life in Rawalpindi, and delivered lectures to audiences on the values of religious life and on political analysis until his death in July 2009. Azmat- e-Islam and Bedar Pakistan are in fact two separate parties headed by Zaheer ul Islam Abbasi and Mr Abdul Razaq Mian, respectively. All of the other alleged plotters have also been released from prison and are now settled in Pakistan leading normal lives as citizens.

By the late 1990s, she was recognized as one of the most critically acclaimed game designers for young girls.  Career  Collaborating with her boyfriend Jeremy Blake, Duncan created three influential CD-ROM computer games for young girls in the second half of the 1990s: Chop Suey, Smarty, and Zero Zero. These games were designed as alternatives to her traditionally male-oriented field where the few \\"girls' games\\" created embodied a \\"model of boy-catching self-fulfillment\\". Duncan spoke out against market-tested girls' games characterized by an \\"earnest blandness\\" and a \\"perfunctory feminism [like] slapping the pink bow on Pacman\\". All three games created by Duncan are story-based and revolve around search and discovery. 1995's Chop Suey is an interactive storybook, where two young girls explore the town of Cortland, Ohio. Smarty (1996) tells the story of the titular young girl's visit to her Aunt Olive for the summer‚Äîthere she hosts a spelling radio show, explores small-town life, and visit a mysterious dime store. Released in 1997, Zero Zero follows a young girl named Pinkee in Fin de si√®cle Paris who hops from rooftop to rooftop, explores the catacombs, and experiences the city. Chop Suey was co-created with Monica Gesue and narrated by then-unknown author David Sedaris. Gesue strived to design a \\"colorful, warm, and bright\\" game that contrasted with the way \\"a lot of computer graphics at the time were really icky\\". For Smarty and Zero Zero, Duncan collaborated with her partner Jeremy Blake. Smarty maintained Chop Suey's \\"warm, handmade, and folk-inspired\\" look, but was also \\"less messy, and more idyllic, with more carefully rendered perspective with \\"loose and painterly\\" backgrounds. Blake created more than 3,000 drawings for the game. Zero Zero was \\"a period piece, and Blake used thick, crooked lines that sometimes seemed to suggest a woodcut drawing\\". Duncan spoke frequently of a proposed game for older girls called Apocalipstick. She described it as something that \\"moves like Doom\\", and \\"involves survivors of a cataclysmic destructive event who find the few films that remain, which happen to be solely swanky thirties Thin Man-style flicks...[and attempt to recreate] life based on the Stork Club and Fortuny and the weapons of glamour\\". In 2000, Duncan created The History of Glamour, a digitally animated hour-long video. Writing for Salon, Matthew Debord described the work as \\"a merciless satire of New York's incestuous '90s cultural moment: fashion, art, celebrity and various downtown style tribes converge and are shredded for our delectation\\". In the same article, Duncan noted that the work is influenced by the play Love, Loss, and What I Wore by Nora and Delia Ephron. The History of Glamour was included in the 2000 Whitney Biennial. Duncan also published frequently. She wrote articles for publications like Artforum, Slate, Feed Magazine, and Bald Ego, and published her own blog called The Wit of the Staircase. At her blog, Duncan listed her interests as \\"film, philology, Vietnam War memorabilia, rare and discontinued perfume, book collecting, philately, card and coin tricks, futurism, Napoleon Bonaparte, the history of electricity.\\"  Legacy  Duncan's CD-ROMs are widely celebrated. Chop Suey has the broadest reputation. Upon its release, Entertainment Weekly named it 1995's \\"CD-ROM of the Year\\" and was generally praised by reviewers.Burr, Ty. \\"1995 The Best & Worst/Multimedia\\", Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved on May 27, 2009. In recent years, it has been celebrated as a significant work of the CD-ROM boom. Kara Swisher wrote in 2007, \\"While the CD-ROM business proved to be a bridge technology and Chop Suey did not endure the onslaught of the Web, after seeing it, I have never forgotten it\\". In 2012 in Motherboard, video games critic Jenn Frank called Chop Suey \\"timeless\\", and celebrated its bravery in representing \\"the criminally underrepresented: that is, the wild imagination of some girl aged 7 to 12\\". Because her games were designed on CD-ROMs to be played on operating systems that are \\"no longer possible to install on modern computers\\", the games were effectively inaccessible to most people. In 2015, Rhizome, a nonprofit that focuses on new media art, restored Duncan's games by making the \\"original, unaltered\\" games playable in a web browser with fundraising assistance via Kickstarter.  Personal life  Theresa Lee Duncan was born in Lapeer, Michigan, to Donnie and Mary Duncan. She lived with partner Jeremy Blake in New York during the nineties while working for an interactive agency, and in Los Angeles until 2007, after which Duncan and Blake moved to back to Manhattan.Amsden, David. \\"Why Did Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake Commit Suicide?\\", New York, August 20, 2007  Death  Duncan was found dead in the East Village, Manhattan apartment she shared with Blake on July 10, 2007. The official cause of death was suicide as a result of the combined ingestion of Tylenol PM‚Äîa combination of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine‚Äîand alcohol. Blake is believed to have killed himself a week later, having been seen by an anonymous 911 caller walking into the Atlantic Ocean near Rockaway Beach, Queens. According to friends of the couple, Duncan and Blake believed that they were being followed and harassed by Scientologists up to the point of their deaths. After her death, two posts appeared on her web log (presumably written prior to her death). On New Year's Eve in 2007, she published her last blog post, titled \\"New Beginning\\", which quoted T. S. Eliot's poem East Coker. The circumstances of Duncan's death led to much media attention, including major articles in Vanity Fair and New York magazine. On November 30, 2008, the New York Post's Page Six reported that Bret Easton Ellis was writing a screenplay about Duncan and Blake based on Nancy Jo Sales' Vanity Fair article about the couple's deaths called \\"The Golden Suicides\\". Director Gus Van Sant had signed on as a consultant for the movie which did not eventually get produced. The Law & Order episode \\"Bogeyman\\" in season 18 is loosely based on the deaths of Duncan and Blake. In the episode, the body of the character paralleling Theresa Duncan has forensic evidence that calls into question her suicide, while the Jeremy Blake parallel character survives his suicide attempt. A legal case against him is disrupted by the cult group, resulting in a near mistrial followed by a plea accepted after the ADA implies both he and the judge are connected to the cult.

Prior to this field assignment, he was the chief of general staff and also directed the directorate-general of the Military Intelligence (DGMI) during his career. Khattak was also an instructor in the National Defence University before being elevated to the senior staff appointments. He has been credited for foresight in predicting the dangers of terrorism and the public appraised reputation when thwarting the conspiracy hatched by infiltrated rogue officers against the government of Prime minister Benazir Bhutto. He opposed the Kargil War and was notably superseded by the former Prime minister Nawaz Sharif after approving the appointment of Khattak's course-mate, General Pervez Musharraf to four-star rank and chief of army staff. Career in the military Indo- Pakistani conflict Ali Kuli Khan Khattak comes from a military family; his father, Habibullah Khan Khattak, was a senior general officer in the Pakistan Army as well as World war hero. After passing the entrance exam with high records, Khattak applied in the ministry of defence for the armed forces. After passing the physical, educational qualifications and social psychological analysis tests, Khattak was asked to report to Pakistan Military Academy (PMA). In 1961, he joined the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) and graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the class of 29th PMA Long Course together with Pervez Musharraf and Abdul Aziz Mirza (later four-star admiral) of Navy. Khattak stood first in his course and high academic marks in his educational courses comparing to other officers of joint forces. Khattak was commissioned in the 12th Battalion of the Baloch Regiment, the same regiment his father had earlier served. He participated well in the 1965 war with India and commanded a small infantry platoon during the conflict. After the war, Kuli attended the Armed Forces War College and proceeded to attend the National Defence University (NDU) and graduated with M.Sc. in Intelligence assessment. He served as an instructor and professor in Command and Staff College in Quetta and research assistant in Armed Forces War College. In 1974, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel; and colonel in 1978. In 1986, he was promoted to one star rank, a Brigadier, and commanded the intelligence brigade. In 1991, he was promoted to Major-General rank and subsequently became General Officer Commanding of 8th Infantry Division. In 1994, he was appointed as director of directorate-general of the Military Intelligence. In 1995, along with Lieutenant-general Jehangir Karamat (chief of general staff), Khattak successfully infiltrated and thwarted the attempted coup hatched by major-general Zahirul Islam Abbasi in an attempt to overthrow the government of Prime minister Benazir Bhutto and replacing with far-right theocratic regime. He was honored by Prime minister Benazir Bhutto publicly and was succeeded to three-star appointment. Exposing the 1995 coup d'√©tat attempt As the DGMI, he exposed the 1995 Pakistani coup d'√©tat attempt in which Major General Zahirul Islam Abbasi tried to overthrow the Benazir Bhutto government and install an Islamist regime. This was the fourth failed (and exposed) coup attempt in Pakistani history. The first one was the 1951 Rawalpindi Conspiracy when Maj Gen Akbar Khan, then CGS tried to overthrow the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan government over the handling of 1948 Kashmir War, the second one was the Attock Conspiracy Case during tenure of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and the third one was during General Zia-ul- Haq's era when Maj Gen Tajammal Hussain Malik was arrested along with other conspirators.Ihtashamul Haque. \\"Coup leaders wanted Islamic revolution\\" Dawn, 15 October 1995 Staff and field appointments Ali Kuli took over the X Corps in October 1995 after his investigations led the Army to uncover the coup attempt. He replaced the then X corps commander Lt Gen Ghulam Muhammad Malik, whose name also surfaced in the coup attempts, but was later exonerated. Kuli later became the Chief of General Staff after Lt Gen Iftikhar Ali Khan was made the Defence Secretary by then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He retired from the army when Musharraf was made the COAS in October 1998. At that time, Musharraf superseded two senior officers; Ali Kuli Khan Khattak and Khalid Nawaz, the then Quarter-Master General (QMG). Resignation In 1995, he was promoted to Lieutenant-General rank with Pervez Musharraf seconded to him. Problems with Musharraf started in 1995, when Khattak was selected by Chief of Army Staff General Jehangir Karamat as Chief of General Staff. His seniority listing had been manipulated by the previous Chief of Army Staff General Waheed Kakar in an effort to promote him as Chief of Army Staff. He also had cordial relations with Chief of Army Staff General Karamat, but this came at a bad juncture for Khattak in 1998. In 1998 Prime minister Nawaz Sharif forcefully relieved General Karamat of his duties (see Dismissal of General Jehangir Karamat). Prime minister ignored General Ali Kuli Khan's appointment and decided to promote Pervez Musharraf to four star rank and assigned duties over him. Post retirement Criticism to Pervez Musharraf He is also very critical of Musharraf's book In the Line of Fire, where according to him, the author puts Ali Kuli Khan Khattak's image in a negative manner.

On the show, Wo Fat is the nemesis of Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord and Alex O'Loughlin), the head of Hawaii's (fictional) special task force, Five-O. The character appeared in eleven episodes of the original Hawaii Five-O including the TV-movie pilot and the final episode. Two of his appearances were in two-part episodes and three were two-hour specials later re-edited into two-parters for reruns. The character evolved from the beginning as a master spy for China, later into an extremist Chinese agent working with a hawkish Chinese general. The general opposed peace discussions with the United States in the early 1970s. By the end of the series, Wo Fat had become an international super-criminal out for his own interests. In the last episode, Wo Fat is finally arrested and jailed after 12 years as a wanted criminal. However, in the final shot, he smiles and craftily produces a file hidden in his shoe. It remains a perpetual cliffhanger. In the original show, Wo Fat was portrayed by Khigh Dhiegh (born Kenneth Dickerson) who, despite looking sufficiently Asian for the role, was actually of mixed English, Egyptian, and Sudanese ancestry. Actor and martial artist Mark Dacascos, who had Irish Spanish Filipino Japanese and Chinese ancestry, portrayed the character in the 2010 reboot. Name origin Chinatown district of Honolulu. Leonard Freeman, the producer of the series, took the name for the character from the now-defunct Wo Fat restaurant in Honolulu's Chinatown. The Wo Fat Building is in the Chinatown Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Original show: Hawaii Five-O (1968‚Äì1980) Evolution of Wo Fat's role with the Chinese government In the first four years of the show's existence, Wo Fat made nine appearances. In Hawaii Five-O: Cocoon (September 20, 1968), the series pilot, Wo Fat, as a Chinese spy, uses sensory deprivation to crack the most loyal U.S. intelligence agents to give up top secret information. He was absent from the show for a year, but then made eight appearances over the three-year period from October 1969 to October 1972. In these appearances, Wo Fat continues his position as a top Chinese intelligence agent in the Pacific, whose duties include running Chinese spy missions in Hawaii. Wo Fat's appearances during this period are: \\"Forty Feet High and It Kills!\\" (October 8, 1969), \\"A Bullet for McGarrett\\" (October 29, 1969), \\"And a Time to Die...\\" (September 16, 1970), \\"F.O.B. Honolulu: Part 1\\" (January 27, 1971), \\"F.O.B. Honolulu: Part 2\\" (February 3, 1971), \\"The Ninety-Second War: Part 1\\" (January 18, 1972), \\"The Ninety-Second War: Part 2\\" (January 25, 1972), and \\"The Jinn Who Clears the Way\\" (October 10, 1972), There was a two-year gap before Wo Fat turned up again, by which time his circumstances had changed. In the episode titled \\"Presenting... in the Center Ring... Murder\\" (December 10, 1974), Wo Fat is working for a hawkish government faction in China, and attempts to assassinate the Chinese foreign minister, who represents the more peace-oriented leadership in China at the time. A year later, In \\"Murder‚ÄîEyes Only\\" (September 12, 1975), Wo Fat returns to his more traditional role as an intelligence operative attempting to obtain the coordinates for a downed American military satellite in the Pacific through a mole in U.S. Naval Intelligence. However, a year after that, in \\"Nine Dragons\\" (September 30, 1976), Wo Fat is depicted as the head of the Chinese mafia, who is attempting to cause a conflict between the U.S. and China through a mass killing in China from American-developed nerve gas, stolen from Hawaii, which would allow him to regain power in the Chinese government. Wo Fat was then not seen for nearly four years. In his final appearance and the series finale (\\"Woe to Wo Fat\\" (April 5, 1980)), Wo Fat is presented as completely unaffiliated with the Chinese government, operating on a remote island, developing a solar weapon for the highest bidder. The evolution of Wo Fat's role with regard to the Chinese government is presumably due to President Richard Nixon's rapprochement visit to China in February 1972 and his talks with Mao Zedong that led to a period of d√©tente between the two nations. A regular recurring character in the show's first four seasons, Wo Fat's appearances after the historic event became far more sporadic: just five episodes in eight years.

Like the original Wo Fat, Dacascos's character is depicted as criminal and a former agent of the Chinese government (specifically the Ministry of State Security). Storylines Wo Fat debuted in the last scene of the first-season episode \\"Hana 'a'a Makehewa\\" on December 13, 2010. In the episode, Wo Fat pays Victor Hesse a visit in jail and asks about Steve McGarrett's (Alex O'Loughlin) pursuit of justice for his father John (William Sadler), whom Hesse killed in the pilot episode. Over the course of the season, Wo Fat attracts McGarrett's attention because of his association with local Yakuza boss Hiro Noshimuri. It is revealed that Wo Fat ordered the death of the elder McGarrett and frames Steve in the season finale for killing Governor Jameson (who was in collusion with him). As the second season begins, Wo Fat orders Hesse to kill McGarrett behind bars and kills Hesse to prevent Five-0 from getting more answers about him. He is also in cahoots with ex‚ÄìCIA analyst Jenna Kaye, whose fianc√© was captured in an earlier mission to take down Wo Fat. This allows him to manipulate Kaye in getting Steve's help for a fake ransom exchange in North Korea. He kills her and disappears as Five-0 rescues Steve. It is revealed that Wo Fat is obsessed with finding and killing a person named \\"Shelburne\\", who apparently killed his father years before the series. As Wo Fat hides in Osaka, late in the season, McGarrett captures him and brings him back to Hawaii. However, both men are forced to work together in fighting off Hiro's son and successor Adam, who was seeking revenge for his father's death. McGarrett locks him up at the Halawa Correctional Facility at the end of the season. As the third season begins, \\"In La O Na Makuahine\\", Wo Fat is on the verge of being transferred but the prison truck he is in is attacked. The truck is then transported by a helicopter and dropped into the ocean. Armed men in SCUBA cut through the truck's secure door with torches and kill the guards, resulting in Fat being freed. It is later revealed that Frank Delano is the man responsible for attacking the truck and breaking Wo Fat out. The two strike up a deal; Delano will be able to get stolen drugs off the island in exchange for giving Wo Fat the location of Shelburne, who happens to be Doris McGarrett, Steve's supposedly dead mother. Wo Fat eventually confronts Doris in Steve's home and the two exchange in a stand-off, holding each other at gunpoint. However, Doris fires three shots into the ground, giving Wo Fat time to escape although it's not known the extent of the relationship Doris has with Wo Fat. In \\"Hana I Wa 'I\\", Wo Fat kidnaps a congressman and is about to kill him until a helicopter manned by Steve with Danny firing arrives on scene. Wo Fat exchanges gunfire with Danny before fleeing yet again. In \\"Imi Loko Ka 'Uhane\\", Wo Fat returns, disguised as a police officer, and when reporter Savannah Walker interviews him during the show she videotaped about Five-0, McGarrett notices Wo Fat and started to shoot him but he got away. Later in the episode, Five-0 tracks him to the jungle where he gets severely injured when the helicopter he tries to escape in gets shot down. McGarrett refuses to kill him and instead sends him to the hospital with police guarding the hospital, where he is bandaged and handcuffed to the bed. In \\"Aloha, Malama Pono\\", Wo Fat is seen lying in a bed in a high risk detention facility at an unknown location with Steve standing in the room, staring at him. At the end of the episode, McGarrett pays him another visit and wants to know why his mother came to see him. Wo Fat agrees to tell him, but first McGarrett has to get Fat out of the jail. Then they both hear an explosion. Fat tells Steve that he is his protection because the unknown forces currently breaking down the door are not here to rescue him, but want him dead. As the fourth season begins, \\"In Aloha kekahi i kekahi\\", NLM terrorists attempt to kill Wo Fat but McGarrett saves him. Before Wo Fat is transferred to a Supermax facility in Colorado, McGarrett wants an answer from Wo Fat why Doris visited him. Fat says she wanted to apologize to him for killing his father. In \\"O ka Pili'Ohana ka 'Oi\\", he is given medication in his solitary confinement cell by an officer for his heart condition. He is asked to swallow the medication and open his mouth so that it is certain he ingested it. Wo Fat hides the pills well in his mouth and reaches inside his toilet to reveal that this is not the first time he has faked it. He then uses the medication along with paint thinner and fertilizer from the jail, to craft an explosion to take out a wall in his cell to escape. He is positively ID'd at a gas station near Colorado Springs, pouring gasoline on someone, lighting them on fire, then stealing their truck to head back to Oahu. After Grover's daughter Samantha is freed from Ian Wright's capture, she tells everyone that a man, revealed to be Wo Fat, killed Ian and released her. McGarrett is given a message from Samantha that Wo Fat will see him soon. In the 100th episode, \\"Ina Paha\\", Wo Fat abducts Steve and tortures him in order to try to learn where he believes the U.S. government is holding his father.

For instance, several seasons of the 1990s police drama Homicide: Life on the Street featured a recurring drug lord named Luther Mahoney whose gang always seem to escape the blame for the murders they cause. In the DVD commentary for that series, producers explained that Mahoney was largely based on Wo Fat, and then adapted to the gritty Baltimore setting of their series. Wo Fat also has a U.S. stoner rock band named after him. They released an album in 2012 entitled The Black Code which features powerful riffs and has been compared to a cross between Kyuss and Electric Wizard.

It is an adaptation of the 1842 Viennese play Einen Jux will er sich machen by Johann Nestroy, which had been adapted twice by Thornton Wilder. The first Wilder version, 1938, entitled The Merchant of Yonkers, was faithful to the original material, but the second Wilder version, 1955, renamed The Matchmaker, expanded the, previously secondary, role of Dolly Gallagher Levi, who later became the heroine of the Jerry Herman musical hit, Hello, Dolly!. Stoppard's adaptation eliminates the Dolly character. The play's title is a euphemism, often used by the British press, to describe the actions of a celebrity who has drunk, or is about to drink, a considerable amount of alcohol. Plot Stoppard's farce consists of two hours of slapstick shenanigans, mistaken identities, misdirected orders, malapropisms, double entendres, and romantic complications. Herr Zangler, the twisted- tongued proprietor of an upscale grocery store in a small Austrian village, plans to marry Mme. Knorr, the proprietor of a women's clothing shop in Vienna. In preparation for his new life in the big city, he orders a new wardrobe and hires the fast-talking Melchior as a personal assistant. He arranges to send his niece Marie to his sister-in-law in Vienna, Miss Blumenblatt, to protect her from the penniless Sonders who is courting her. As he departs for Vienna, Zangler entrusts the operation of his business to his garrulous head clerk, Weinberl, and his naive apprentice, Christopher, but they decide to go \\"on the razzle\\" to Vienna. Almost immediately, Weinberl and Christopher catch sight of Zangler and disguise themselves as mannequins in the window of Mme. Knorr's House of Fashion. Circumstances propel the two into a fancy restaurant in the company of Mme. Knorr and her customer, Frau Fischer who has been roped into pretending she is Weinberl's new wife, the same restaurant to which Zangler intends to take Mme. Knorr. Several sprinting waiters, a sexually obsessed coachman, and a carefully positioned Chinese screen come into play, and things finally seem to be settling down when the eloping Sonders and Marie enter the scene, and the chaos starts anew. The various characters flee to Miss Blumenblatt's, who mistakes Weinberl and the disguised Christopher as Sonders and Marie. Eventually, all is sorted out, Christopher and Weinberl make it back to the store in time to prevent Zangler from ever knowing they were gone. Everything solves itself: Sonders comes into an inheritance and is allowed to marry Marie, Weinberl and Frau Fischer discover they have been romantic pen pals all along, Christopher is promoted, Zangler and Mme.

The playhouse occupies the site of the former Carmel Arts and Crafts Clubhouse, Carmel's first cultural center and theatre, built in 1906-1907 on Casanova Street, and the Arts and Crafts Hall, built in 1923-1924 on an adjacent lot on Monte Verde Street. The early Carmel bohemians participated in events held at these facilities, including writers Mary Austin and George Sterling. The dramatic presentations there achieved national attention as early as 1914, and an article in The Mercury Herald commented \\"...a fever of activity seems to have seized the community and each newcomer is immediately inoculated and begins with great enthusiasm to do something... with plays, studios and studies...\\". Both the clubhouse and the Arts & Crafts Hall were destroyed by fire in 1949. The current building, which now houses 2 theatres, was built in 1952 by Edward G. Kuster, owner and operator of both the Golden Bough Playhouse, as well as its predecessor, the Theatre of the Golden Bough, which was located on Ocean Ave. Since 1994, the facility has been owned and operated by Pacific Repertory Theatre, Monterey County's only year-round professional theatre company. A two-phase renovation of the aging facility began with an interior building project in 2011. A second phase project, including both interior and exterior renovations, is scheduled for 2020. History  The early years of Carmel theatre  In 1905, to foster the arts in the village of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club was formed. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the village received an influx of artists and other creative people escaping the disaster area. Jack London describes the artists' colony in a portion of his novel, The Valley of the Moon. Among the noted writers and poets who thrived in Carmel and were associated with the club were Mary Austin, George Sterling, Robinson Jeffers and Sinclair Lewis. In 1906-07, the club built the town's first cultural center and theatre, The Carmel Arts and Crafts Clubhouse. Poets Austin and Sterling performed their \\"private theatricals\\" there. By 1913, The Arts and Crafts Club had begun organizing lessons for aspiring painters, actors & craftsmen.Monica Hudson,Carmel-By-The- Sea, Arcadia Publishing, 2006 Some of the most prominent painters in the United States, such as William Merritt Chase, Xavier Martinez, Mary DeNeale Morgan and C. Chapel Judson offered six weeks of instruction for $15. The dramas enacted by the Arts and Crafts Club attracted considerable attention, with an article in The Clubwoman noting, \\"Probably no other women's club in the country has achieved a more remarkable success in the way of dramatic ventures than has The Carmel Club of Arts and Crafts\\".  Golden Bough Theatre  Theatrical activities in the town grew to such a proportion that between 1922 and 1924, two competing indoor theatres were built - the Carmel Arts and Crafts Hall on Monte Verde Street (which was renamed numerous times including the Abalone Theatre, the Filmarte, and the Carmel Playhouse) and the first Theatre of the Golden Bough, located on Ocean Ave near the SE corner of Monte Verde Street. This \\"Golden Bough\\" (one of two) was designed and built by Edward G. \\"Ted\\" Kuster. Kuster was a musician and lawyer from Los Angeles who relocated to Carmel to establish his own theatre and school.  Abalone Theatre and Manzanita Theatre  In 1928, the Abalone League, a local amateur baseball club and active thespian group, bought the Arts and Crafts Hall from the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club and renames it the Abalone Theatre, and later that year Kuster leased the Theatre of the Golden Bough (on Ocean Ave) to a local movie exhibitor, the Manzanita Theatre. Kuster then traveled to Europe for one year to study production techniques in Berlin and to negotiate for rights to produce English and European plays in the United States. In 1929, after returning from is European trip, Kuster was approached by the Abalone League who, beset by financial trouble, offered to sell Kuster its entire theatre operation, including both Monte Verde and Casanova Street buildings - an offer that Kuster readily accepted. Kuster remodeled the facility and renamed it the Studio Theatre of the Golden Bough.Back Again, Intriguing history of Carmel's Golden Bough Theatre, Alta Vista Magazine/Monterey County Herald, Sunday August 28, 1994 He moved all of his activities - plays concerts, traveling theatre groups, lectures - to the theatre on Monte Verde Street. He then leased the theatre of the Golden Bough on Ocean Avenue to movie theater chain for a period of five years. Kuster stipulated that the name \\"Golden Bough\\" could not be used for a movie house so it was renamed the Carmel Theatre.  Carmel Theatre and Fires  From 1932 until 1934, Kuster produced plays in San Francisco and directed a season for the Fresno Players where his translation of By Candlelight is first presented. In 1935, Kuster renegotiated his lease with the movie tenants of the Theatre of the Golden Bough (on Ocean Ave.), to perform a stage play one weekend each month. On May 17, 1935, he opened his production of By Candlelight, but two nights later, on May 19, the original Theatre of the Golden Bough was destroyed by fire. Arson was the suspected cause of the blaze. Kuster, who had previously bought out the Arts and Crafts Theatre, moved his film operation to the older facility on Monte Verde Street, renamed it the Filmarte and becomes the first \\"art house\\" between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The original Theatre of the Golden Bough after the devastating 1935 fire. In 1936, Kuster returned to San Francisco to a Sutter and Van Ness 200-seat theater, naming it the Golden Bough Playhouse. In 1938, Theatre labor union problems forced him to give up the project. Later that year he was invited to Hollywood for two years as the personal assistant to Max Reinhardt. While there, he taught classes and directed English and American plays in Reinhardt's Theatre Workshop. In 1940, Kuster returned to Carmel and the Filmarte, whose lease had expired, renamed it the Golden Bough Playhouse and again presented plays, foreign films and quality American films year-round. For two summers, 1940 and 1941, he directed the Golden Bough School of Theatre. In 1949, after remounting By Candlelight, this second \\"Golden Bough\\" also burned to the ground. Once again, arson was suspected. Kuster considered rebuilding two theatres, a playhouse at the Monte Verde location, and a movie theatre at the site of the original Golden Bough on Ocean Avenue. Ultimately, he built a two-theater facility on the Monte Verde site. The main auditorium, called the Golden Bough, faced Monte Verde Street. With 330 seats and an ample stage it was designed to present both movies and live performances. Beneath the main stage, an intimate 150-seat theater in the round, called the \\"Circle Theatre,\\" faced Casanova Street. The new Golden Bough opened its doors on October 2, 1952 with a Monterey Symphony Orchestra concert.  United Artists Theaters  Kuster died in September 1961. In 1965 the Golden Bough was sold to United California Theatres - a movie chain that was later absorbed by United Artists Theaters. For the next 29 years it was a first-run movie house known as the Golden Bough Cinema. The Circle Players continued to rent the Circle Theater for two more years until a city building inspector noted several deficiencies in the electrical system. Lacking funds for repair, the Circle Theatre closed in 1967.  Pacific Repertory Theatre  In 1994, United Artists put the theatre up for sale. The building was purchased by Pacific Repertory Theatre (PacRep), Monterey County's only year-round professional theatre company.\\"Pacific Repertory Theatre\\", Theatre Bay Area website, accessed July 23, 2009 The facility includes the 330-seat Golden Bough Theatre and a revitalized 120-seat Circle Theatre, presenting over 175 performances in Carmel every year. In 2006, the Carmel Historic Resources Board gave approval for PacRep to make modifications to the building, including remodeling or demolition. In 2008, PacRep presented the Carmel Planning Commission with concept plans for a renovated facility. The first phase of remodeling was completed 2011, and included safety updates, a digital projection system, and a double-revolving stage. Fundraising for the second phase, to include a reconfiguration of the audience seating and the lobby, began in 2017. The phase 2 remodel is projected to take place in 2020.

Sheridan Le Fanu. Despite Le Fanu resisting its classification as such, the novel has also been hailed as a work of sensation fiction by contemporary reviewers and modern critics alike. It is an early example of the locked-room mystery subgenre, rather than a novel of the supernatural (despite a few creepily ambiguous touches), but does show a strong interest in the occult and in the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish scientist, philosopher and Christian mystic. Like many of Le Fanu's novels, Uncle Silas grew out of an earlier short story, in this case \\"A Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess\\" (1839), which he also published as \\"The Murdered Cousin\\" in the collection Ghost Stories and Tales of Mystery (1851). While this earlier story was set in Ireland, the novel's action takes place in Derbyshire; the author Elizabeth Bowen was the first to identify a distinctly Irish subtext to the novel, however, in spite of its English setting. It was first serialized in the Dublin University Magazine in 1864, under the title Maud Ruthyn and Uncle Silas, and appeared in December of the same year as a three-volume novel from the London publisher Richard Bentley.McCormack, W. J. (1997). Sheridan Le Fanu. Gloucestershire: Sutton Publishing. . Several changes were made from the serialization to the volume edition, such as resolving the inconsistencies of names. Plot summary The novel is a first-person narrative told from the point of view of the adolescent girl Maud Ruthyn, an heiress living with her sombre, reclusive father Austin Ruthyn in their mansion at Knowl. Through her father and her worldly, cheerful cousin, Lady Monica Knollys, she gradually learns more regarding her uncle, Silas Ruthyn, a black sheep of the family whom she has never met; once an infamous rake and gambler, he is now apparently a fervently reformed Christian. His reputation has been tainted by the suspicious suicide of a man to whom Silas owed an enormous gambling debt, which took place within a locked, apparently impenetrable room in Uncle Silas's mansion at Bartram- Haugh. In the first part of the novel, Maud's father hires a French governess, Madame de la Rougierre, as a companion for her. Madame terrifies Maud and appears to have designs on her; during two of their walks together, Maud is brought into suspicious contact with strangers that seem to be known to Madame. (In a cutaway scene that breaks the first-person narrative, we learn that she is in league with Silas's good-for-nothing son Dudley.) The governess is eventually dismissed when she is discovered by Maud in the act of burgling her father's desk. Maud is asked in obscure terms by her father if she is willing to undergo some kind of \\"ordeal\\" to clear the name of her uncle, and of the family more generally; shortly after she assents, he dies. At the reading of his will, it emerges that her father added a codicil to it: Maud is to stay with Silas until she comes of age; if she dies whilst still a minor, the estate will pass to Silas. Lady Knollys, together with Austin's executor and fellow Swedenborgian, Dr. Bryerly, attempt in vain to overturn the codicil, realizing its many dangerous implications for the young heiress; despite their efforts, Maud consents willingly to spending the next three and a half years at Bartram-Haugh. Maud initially finds life at Bartram-Haugh strange but not unpleasant, despite ominous signs such as the uniformly unfriendly servants and a malevolent factotum of Silas's, the one-legged Dickon Hawkes. Silas himself frightens Maud but is nonetheless seemingly kind to her, in contrast to his treatment of his own children, the loutish Dudley and the uneducated Millicent ('Milly'). Although Maud initially deprecates Millicent's rustic mannerisms they become best friends, and each other's only source of companionship at the estate. During her stay, Maud is subject to various attempts by Dudley to court her, but she rejects him thoroughly on each occasion. Silas is periodically subject to mysterious catatonic fits, attributed to his massive opium consumption. Various ominous happenings begin to take place at Bartram-Haugh; it becomes increasingly difficult for Maud and Millicent to find any route out of the estate; meanwhile, Dudley's courtship culminates in a marriage proposition to Maud; when she confronts Silas about it, he attempts to coax her into accepting. She is relieved when it emerges that Dudley is already married, and when, after being disowned by his father, he and his wife leave to set sail from Liverpool to New York. It is afterwards decided that Millicent should attend a boarding school in France, and Silas sends her away with the promise that Maud is to join her after three months. Maud is shocked to discover Madame residing at Bartram-Haugh in the employ of Silas, and suspects also that Dudley may not have fled. Despite strong protest by Maud, Madame is charged with accompanying her first to London, and then on to Dover and across the Channel. After falling asleep during the journey and being escorted under the cover of darkness, Maud awakes to find herself again at Bartram-Haugh: she had in fact been on a round trip to London and back. Maud finds herself now imprisoned in one of the mansion's many bedrooms under the guard of Madame, whilst everyone believes she is in France. Remembering the earlier warnings of Lady Knollys, Maud refuses to drink any of the drugged claret intended for her; instead, Madame, ignorant of Silas' true intentions, partakes of it and promptly falls asleep on Maud's bed. Later that night, Dudley scales the building and enters the unlit room; the window he uses is set upon concealed hinges that allow it to be opened only from the outside. Hidden out of sight, Maud witnesses Dudley brutally murder Madame by mistake in the near-darkness. Silas enters the room, having been waiting outside; as he does this, Maud slips out undetected. Assisted by Dickon's daughter, whom Maud had befriended during her stay, she is swiftly conveyed by carriage to Lady Knolly's estate, and away from Bartram-Haugh. Silas is discovered in the morning lying dead of an opium overdose, while Dudley becomes a fugitive and is thought to be hiding in Australia. Maud is happily married to the charming and handsome Lord Ilbury and ends her recollections on a philosophical note: Allusions/references from other works Uncle Silas remains Le Fanu's best- known novel. It was the source for Arthur Conan Doyle's The Firm of Girdlestone, and remains a touchstone for contemporary mystery fiction. There are also strong connections between Uncle Silas and some of Wilkie Collins' novels, especially The Woman in White; both writers, while recognisably within the Gothic tradition, depict heroines who are far more highly developed than the persecuted maidens of Ann Radcliffe and others.David Punter, 1996, \\"The Literature of Terror: A History of Gothic Fictions from 1765 to the Present Day\\", Vol. I, \\"The Gothic Tradition\\", pp. 203-6. Film and television adaptations A film version, also titled Uncle Silas (though initially released in the United States as The Inheritance), was made by Gainsborough Studios in 1947. It was directed by Charles Frank, with Derrick De Marney as Silas and Jean Simmons as the heroine (whose given name was changed from Maud to Carolyn). A feature-length British television adaptation was made for the Thames Television series Mystery and Imagination (1968). Maud was played by Lucy Fleming with Robert Eddison as Silas. In 1977 a West German series Uncle Silas was produced featuring Hannes Messemer in the title role.

A Shakespearean actor on stage, he also had a successful career in film. He was the father of science fiction and fantasy writer Fritz Leiber Jr., who was also an actor for a time. Life Born in Chicago, Leiber was based there for most of his pre-Hollywood career. He married Virginia Bronson (1885‚Äì1970), who like him was a Shakespearean performer. Leiber died, in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, from a heart attack at the age of 67. Career Caesar with Theda Bara in Cleopatra (1917) Leiber and his wife spent much of their time touring in a Shakespearian acting company, known by the 1930s as Fritz Leiber & Co. Leiber made his film bow in 1916, playing Mercutio in the Francis X. Bushman version of Romeo and Juliet. With his piercing eyes and shock of white hair, Leiber seemed every inch the priests, professors, musical professors, and religious fanatics that he was frequently called upon to play in films. His many silent-era portrayals included Caesar in Theda Bara's 1917 Cleopatra and Solomon in the mammoth 1921 Betty Blythe vehicle The Queen of Sheba. He thrived as a character actor in sound films, usually in historical roles. In the film Champagne Waltz, he portrayed an orchestra maestro; the role required him to play classical music on a violin and jazz on a clarinet. One of Leiber's larger assignments of the 1940s, and his most notable musical role, was as Franz Liszt in the Claude Rains remake of Phantom of the Opera (1943). Leiber appears together with his son Fritz Leiber, Jr. in the wedding-feast scene of Greta Garbo's film Camille (1936) and in Warner Bros.' The Great Garrick (1937). Leiber also appeared with his son Fritz Leiber, Jr. in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) but Fritz Leiber, Jr. was not credited for his small speaking part. Fritz Leiber in The Story of Louis Pasteur trailer Late in his career, Leiber performed briefly opposite Charles Chaplin as the priest who visits Monsieur Verdoux in his prison cell. Portrait collection For most or all of his long acting career, Leiber had a hobby: each time he performed a new role, he had his likeness or portrait made in costume and make-up for that role. Since Leiber was not an especially protean actor, he tended to look the same in every part: therefore, to bring some variety to his portrait collection, he varied the format and media of each likeness: one was a full-length oil painting, another a charcoal sketch of his upper body; one a sculpted bust, one a clay bas-relief, and so forth. After the actor's death, all of his surviving portraits passed to his son, Fritz Leiber Jr., who found himself in the awkward situation of sharing a cramped residence with more than two hundred copies of his father's face; Leiber Jr. later used this experience as the basis of his 1963 story \\"237 Talking Statues, Etc.\\" The two Fritz Leibers also physically resembled each other enough to give casual visitors the impression that the portraits were of Leiber Jr. himself.

Previously, he was a fellow of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative at Harvard University, as well as program director at the Social Science Research Council on AIDS in New York City.old Alexander De Waal bio at Harvard University from 28 January 2008, courtesy of the Internet Wayback Machine (accessed 13 June 2009) Considered an expert on Sudan and the Horn of Africa, his work and practice has also probed humanitarian crisis and response, human rights, HIV/AIDS and governance in Africa, and conflict and peacebuilding. Childhood and education He is the son of Esther Aline (n√©e Lowndes-Moir), a writer on religion, and Rev. Dr Victor de Waal, Dean of Canterbury from 1976 to 1986. His siblings include barrister John de Waal, ceramic artist and writer Edmund de Waal, and Caucasus expert Thomas de Waal. In 1988, de Waal received a D.Phil in social anthropology at Nuffield College, Oxford for his thesis on the 1984-5 Darfur famine in Sudan. This research formed the basis of his book, Famine That Kills: Darfur, Sudan (1989). The following year he joined the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, only to resign in December 1992 in protest for HRW's support for the American military involvement in Somalia. Human rights activism De Waal was the first chairman of the Mines Advisory Group at the beginning of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. De Waal set up two human rights organisations, African Rights (1993) and Justice Africa (1999), focusing respectively on documenting human rights abuses and developing policies to respond to human rights crises, notably in Rwanda, Somalia and Sudan. His book, Famine Crimes: Politics and the Disaster Relief Industry was published in 1997. Foreign Affairs described the book as \\"A powerful critique of the international humanitarian agencies dominating famine relief in Africa.\\" African Rights, which mainly dealt with the situation in Rwanda, has later come under criticism. Luc Reydams argued in 2016 that \\"African Rights was instrumental in shaping and spreading an easily consumable one-sided narrative of the Rwandan conflict\\". From 1997 to 2001, he focused on avenues to peaceful resolution of the Second Sudanese Civil War. In 2001, he returned to his work on health in Africa, writing on the intersection of HIV/AIDS, poverty and drought. As the conflict worsened in 2004, he returned to his doctoral thesis topic of Darfur. During 2005 and 2006, de Waal was seconded to the African Union mediation team for Darfur. In 2008 he became well known as a critic of the International Criminal Court's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Sudanese president Omar al Bashir. During 2005‚Äì06, de Waal was seconded to the African Union mediation team for Darfur, and from 2009‚Äì12 served as senior adviser to the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel for Sudan. He was on the list of Foreign Policy's 100 most influential public intellectuals in 2008 and Atlantic Monthly's 27 \\"brave thinkers\\" in 2009. He is an editor of the African Arguments book series published by Zed Books with Richard Dowden, Director of the Royal African Society. de Waal also writes and published regular commentary on contemporary Sudan through his World Peace Foundation blog Reinventing Peace.

He is an author of five books. Shiau is a holder of the civil decoration the Public Service Medal (Pingat Bakti Masyarakat) which is awarded for commendable public service in Singapore, and for achievements in the field of arts and letters, et al. Other writers who have been conferred the Public Service Medal include Edwin Thumboo and Simon Tay.  Education  Shiau was born in Singapore in 1971, and of Hakka and Peranakan grandparentage. He was educated at Raffles Institution, Raffles Junior College, and graduated from the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore on the Dean's List in 1996. A Fulbright scholar, and an alumnus of the East-West Center in Honolulu established by the United States Congress in 1960, Shiau was the Visiting Writer in Fall 2003 to the University of California, Berkeley (Centre for Southeast Asian Studies).  Literary career  Shiau is the author of Heartland (1999), Peninsular: Archipelagos and Other Islands (2000), and Velouria (2007). He is also a co-editor of Coast (2010), a seminal mono-titular anthology. Travel guide Lonely Planet: Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei has cited Shiau as the author of the \\"definitive Singapore novel\\", and The Arts Magazine had described Shiau as \\"among the most exciting of the post-1965 generation of writers\\".  Heartland (1999)  Shiau's first work, Heartland is an existential novel. It deals with the paradox of rootedness and rootlessness of Singaporeans born after the Japanese Occupation. The book received the Singapore Literature Prize Commendation Award in 1998, together with Alfian Sa'at's Corridor. Heartland was named by Singapore's English daily The Straits Times in December 1999, along with J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace, as one of the 10 Best Books of the Year. In 2007, an academic edition of Heartland was adopted into a textbook for Singapore secondary schools offering English literature in their GCE O-Level curriculum. In 2015, Heartland was selected by The Business Times as one of the Top 10 English Singapore books from 1965 to 2015, alongside titles by Arthur Yap, Goh Poh Seng and Philip Jeyaretnam. In the same year, MediaCorp commissioned the adaptation of Heartland into a telemovie directed by K Rajagopal. Heartland, the telemovie, was broadcast in August 2015.  Peninsular: Archipelagos and Other Islands (2000)  A year after Heartland was published, Shiau released a poetry collection, Peninsular: Archipelagos and Other Islands. Poems from Peninsular have been included in several international and Singapore anthologies. Emeritus Professor Edwin Thumboo wrote an essay about Peninsular titled 'Time and Place: History and Geography in Daren Shiau‚Äôs Poetry' in which he commented: \\"The incisive revelations of Shiau's work begin with the significance and the reach of his themes.... Interrelated and overlapping, they explain both the intrinsic unity of his work and ‚Äì for me at least ‚Äì its importance in the present overall balance of Singapore literature in English\\". The Singapore literature platform, poetry.sg, observes in its ‚ÄòCritical Introduction‚Äô to Shiau: ‚ÄúShiau‚Äôs first collection of poetry, Peninsular, encapsulates through its structure and its themes the dual concerns of history and spatiality in his writing, which began early on in Heartland (both the original collection of poetry and the final publication conceived as a novel), and which persists in later work such as Velouria.  Velouria (2007) and microfiction  Velouria is a seminal collection of Singaporean microfiction, published by Shiau in 2007. The title story of the book is named after a track by Boston-based alternative rock band, the Pixies. Other stories in the volume were named after songs by artistes such as My Bloody Valentine and Thelonious Monk. In 2005, Shiau was first runner-up in the Golden Point Award creative writing competition for his short story, Take Your Wings Off, I Say. An excerpt of the story appears as the last piece in Velouria. An editorial on Shiau‚Äôs writing on poetry.sg notes that his ‚Äúwry observational poetry is transposed into [his] later collection of microfiction, Velouria, which also maintains the elegiac quality of poetry, while combining the compression and suggestiveness of poetic language with the broader narrative and character developments afforded by prose‚Äù.  Coast (2010) and editorial work  On the editorial front, Shiau co-edited with Lee Wei Fen in 2010, an experimental anthology, Coast, which featured creative works by published and unpublished writers across a single title. Literary critic, Dr Gwee Li Sui, has described Coast as \\"a manifesto, a call to stretch out the tent poles of language and go in search of an idiom for making destiny\\".  Other literary involvements  Shiau has been invited to read in New York, Boston, and at venues across the United States, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has been a guest writer at the Melbourne Writers Festival, and the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. His works have also been translated into several languages, namely Italian, German, Chinese, Malay, Tamil, and have been featured in cross-discipline public performances by other artists. In 2015, Shiau collaborated with indie band Riot in Magenta to present a performance at the Esplanade Recital Studio as part of the Singapore Writers Festival. Shiau has served as a writing mentor for the Creative Arts Programme administered by the Ministry of Education, and the National Arts Council's Mentor Access Project. He received the Young Artist Award (Literature) from the National Arts Council in 2002.  Conservation  At the National University of Singapore, Shiau was one of the first chairmen of the environmental activism NGO Students Against Violation of the Earth (SAVE). SAVE was involved in coastal clean-up and reforestation efforts in the 1990s, and spearheaded the university's campus-wide recycling programme. In 1993, Shiau, then a sophomore undergraduate, led SAVE in organising Water for Somalia, a project to raise funds for building water pipelines for Kenyan and Ethiopian refugees. It was the largest national recycling effort at that time, and received recognition and praise by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. in Geneva. A year before his graduation, Shiau was elected the inaugural National Chairman of the Youth Environmental Network of Singapore (YEN), an umbrella organisation for school-based environment NGOs. Shiau was subsequently appointed as Director on the independently-managed Singapore Environment Council, and as Board Member of the National Parks Board, a statutory board of Singapore's Ministry of National Development. He has also been named an international expert of the Commission on Environmental Law of the (IUCN) in Switzerland. In 2016, Shiau was appointed to the Management Committee of the Garden City Fund, an Institute of Public Character in Singapore which complements the National Parks Board's greening and biodiversity conservation efforts. For his outstanding contributions to preservation of the local environment, Shiau was awarded the inaugural Green Leaf Award, the predecessor to the President's Award for the Environment, in 1993. Shiau has also published a trade monograph, Communication and the Environment (2000).  Accolades  Shiau is a recipient of: * the Commonwealth Youth Program Asia Award for Excellence in Youth Work, 2001 administered by the Commonwealth Secretariat * the Singapore Youth Award 2000 (Community Service), conferred by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and * the Outstanding Young Person of Singapore Award 2000, administered by the Ladies Chapter of the Junior Chamber International. In 1993, he was selected by The Straits Times on Singapore's National Day as one of \\"50 Faces to Watch\\". A decade later in 2003, he was again named by The Straits Times on National Day as one of \\"38 Singaporeans Who Make a Difference to Singapore\\". The Japanese community in Singapore recognised Shiau's contributions to civic education by conferring on him the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) Foundation Education Award in 2003. In 2016, Shiau was conferred the Public Service Medal (Pingat Bakti Masyarakat) by the President of the Republic of Singapore.  Public service  Shiau has volunteered actively in the community, particularly in the Central Singapore District. Over the years, he has been appointed by the Singapore Government and the private sector to sit on various national-level committees relating to the arts, education and conservation. This includes working and focus groups of the Committee on the Future Economy (2016), the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Concept Plan Review Committee (both in 2011 and 2001), and the Singapore 21 Committee (1997). Other appointments have included the Films Appeal Committee of the Media Development Authority of Singapore, and the Supervisory Panel of the Government's Feedback Unit. Shiau has also previously served as a Council Member on the National Youth Council.

The film concentrates on the concerns of local workers who have fear of what they call ‚ÄúTio‚Äù or devil. In the film, an elder miner claims that over 8 million people have died in the unsafe mines. The workers believe this is because ‚ÄúTio‚Äù controls the mine and that Christ has no power in the mine. The workers often give offerings such as coca leaves, alcohol, cigarettes and perform sacrifices, such as slaughtering a llama and applying its blood to the mine entrance to appease a makeshift statue of \\"Tio\\". Each mine has its own Tio which all of the workers pray to upon entering so that they may find a good vein of silver and so that they may be granted protection from explosions, toxic gas, silicosis, and falling rocks. The local Catholic priest is unable to tame these fears of ‚ÄúTio‚Äù although the workers often pray at the church before entering the mine,upon observing the miners attending Mass, the local priest said that when he looked into the face of the miners he \\"saw Christ dying\\". The irony which is upon these people is one of great sorrow. They worship both God and the Devil, Light and Dark, The God of the world, and the god of the earthen mine below. As of 2014, Basilio is studying tourism, working in the mines three nights a week, and working as a tour guide in the mines. Bernardino, now married, still works in the mines full-time whilst studying in the evenings. The boys no longer live on the mountain, however their mother remains in the same house.https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/devilsminer/update.html See also *Minerita, a documentary film about women miners of the Cerro Rico References External links * Category:2005 films Category:Documentary films about mining Category:Documentary films about children Category:Mining in Bolivia Category:Child labour Category:Films shot in Bolivia Category:2005 documentary films ","title":"The Devil's Miner"},{"id":"7216756","text":"Madhur Temple Madhur Sree Madanantheshwara-Siddhivinayaka Temple is a popular Shiva and Ganapathi temple located from Kasaragod town, on the banks of Mogral river, locally known as Madhuvahini. Though the main deity of this temple is Lord Shiva known as Madanantheshwara, meaning the god who killed Kama, the god of desires, more importance is given to Lord Ganapathi, who is installed facing south in the main sanctum itself. Priests of this temple belong to the Shivalli Brahmin community. Kashi Vishwanatha, Dharmasastha, Subrahmanya, Durga Parameshwari, Veerabhadra and Gulika are the sub-deities of this temple. There is also presence of Goddess Parvati inside the main sanctum. History Madhur is a very beautiful place Madhur temple was originally Madanantheswara (Shiva) Temple and as the lore goes, an old women called Madaru from local Tulu Moger Community discovered an \\"Udbhava Murthy\\" (a statue that was not made by a human) of shiva linga. Initially, the Ganapathy picture was drawn by a boy, on the southern wall of the Garbhagriha(sanctum sanctorum) while playing. Day by day it became big and fat; so that the boy called Ganapathi as \\"boddajja\\" or \\"bodda ganesha\\". The legend of Kumble seme says Tipu Sultan wanted to demolish the temple like Adooru Mahalingeswara temple during his invasion of Coorg, Tulunadu, and Malabar. But after drinking water from the well of the temple, he changed his mind on attacking and demolishing the Garbhagudi and marched towards Malabar. But to satisfy his soldiers and Islamic scholars he made a cut with his sword symbolizing the attack. The mark is still visible on the building that is built around the temple well. The temple architecture is of 3-tiered gajaprishta type resembling the back of an elephant. One can also find beautiful wooden carvings depicting scenes from the Ramayana.The vast spacious gopurams give good ambiance for the devotees to relax and enjoy the Ganapathi\`s presence. Overview This is one of the Ganapathi temples of six ganpathi temples of ancients Tulunadu, the other five are located at Mangalore (Sharavu Mahaganapathy), Anegudde, Hattiangadi, Idagunji and Gokarna. Devotees from all over throng during the various festivals that happen here. Currently the temple is managed by the government. The temple also offers veda classes to young vatus during summer vacation which also included basics of Sanskrit. The accommodation and food for the vatus are arranged by the temple authorities. Prayers and offerings made Madhuvahini stream near Madhur Temple Devotees usually offer prayers to Mahaganapathi in the form of \\"Udayastamana\\". \\"Appa\\", Madhur's famous prasad, is a very tasty preparation. This is prepared daily and anyone offering prayers can avail these at the counters. Among the special poojas that are performed, \\"Sahasrappa\\" (Thousand appas) is very prominent. It consists of making an offering of thousand appas and then the devotees get to take home all these (and eat them with full relish). Another very special pooja that happens is Moodappam Seva which involves covering the Mahaganapathi statue with Appam. This is usually done on a community scale. Ganesh Chaturthi and Madhur Bedi are the occasions when the temple is at its busiest. The temple usually carries out special poojas on all the major festivals.

During his tenure, Gascony shrank considerably as his brothers inherited important regions and the de facto and perhaps de jure independent duchy slipped into historical near-oblivion. He is mentioned in the cartulary of Auch, as a son of Garc√≠a S√°nchez, and the C√≥dice de Roda, which mentions him as the heir of Gascony. On his father's death, he inherited the duchy itself, which included the viscounties of Lomagen, Gavarret, Tursan, and Bruillois.Monlezun, p 363. His younger brothers, William and Arnold, inherited F√©zensac (including Armagnac) and Astarac respectively with the comital title. Thus was Gascony divided and diminished. In 932, Flodoard records that the brothers Ermengol of Rouergue and Raymond Pons of Toulouse, Princes of Gothia, brought a \\"Lupus Aznar Vasco\\" with them to do homage to Rudolph of France. Lewis considers this \\"Vasco\\" to be the duke of Gascony and calls him \\"S√°nchez.\\" The duke meant, however, would be Sancho.Lewis, 185n. Sancho had two illegitimate sons,Cartulary of Auch.

It is calculated as the average sequence distance between residues that form native contacts in the folded protein divided by the total length of the protein. Higher contact orders indicate longer folding times, and low contact order has been suggested as a predictor of potential downhill folding, or protein folding that occurs without a free energy barrier. This effect is thought to be due to the lower loss of conformational entropy associated with the formation of local as opposed to nonlocal contacts. Relative contact order (CO) is formally defined as: :CO={1 \\\\over {L\\\\cdot N}}\\\\sum^{N}\\\\Delta S_{i,j} where N is the total number of contacts, ŒîSi,j is the sequence separation, in residues, between contacting residues i and j, and L is the total number of residues in the protein. The value of contact order typically ranges from 5% to 25% for single-domain proteins, with lower contact order belonging to mainly helical proteins, and higher contact order belonging to proteins with a high beta-sheet content. Protein structure prediction methods are more accurate in predicting the structures of proteins with low contact orders. This may be partly because low contact order proteins tend to be small, but is likely to be explained by the smaller number of possible long-range residue- residue interactions to be considered during global optimization procedures that minimize an energy function.Mount DM. (2004). Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Even successful structure prediction methods such as the Rosetta method overproduce low-contact-order structure predictions compared to the distributions observed in experimentally determined protein structures. The percentage of the natively folded contact order can also be used as a measure of the \\"nativeness\\" of folding transition states. Phi value analysis in concert with molecular dynamics has produced transition-state models whose contact order is close to that of the folded state in proteins that are small and fast-folding. Further, contact orders in transition states as well as those in native states are highly correlated with overall folding time. In addition to their role in structure prediction, contact orders can themselves be predicted based on a sequence alignment, which can be useful in classifying the fold of a novel sequence with some degree of homology to known sequences.

Engine tuning company Vegantune had been restoring Lotus Elan cars and making some improvements to them. They decided to build a complete new car and set up a separate company, Evante Cars Ltd, to make them. The car's looks were heavily inspired by the Lotus Elan and it was powered by the Ford Kent based Vegantune VTA 1.6 and later 1.7-litre twin overhead cam engine driving the rear wheels through a gearbox originally from a Ford Sierra. The fibreglass body and carbon-fibre was mounted onto a space frame chassis with independent suspension all round. Disc brakes were fitted front and rear. The cars were intended to be available as either complete or in kit form but all cars were supplied fully built and were produced at a rate of about one a week. The bodies were fitted out with leather seats, walnut dashboard and electric windows. Production stopped in 1991 when the original company failed, but the design was bought by Fleur de Lys who specialised in making retro styled vans. They redeveloped the car to take a Ford Zetec 1.8 Litre engine, but only nine more cars were made. An attempt was made to revive the car in 2001, but this was unsuccessful.

The company was founded by Charles Maxwell Kearns I in Beavertown, Snyder County, Pennsylvania about 1903. \\\\- Page 15 Kearns was the son of a buggy maker and had a gift for invention but little more than a grade school education. He began by first mounting an engine on a buggy and progressed to more elaborate designs and heavy trucks. The LuLu automobile was manufactured only in 1914. Billed as \\"more than a cyclecar\\", it had a four-cylinder monobloc engine and three-speed gearing. It sold for $398. Cyclecar The company's logo underwent a series of changes during its existence. The first logo for the \\"Kearns Kar Kompany\\" frames the words in the outline of the grille of a 1907 runabout. The logo for the company boasted the car as being \\"Valveless, Gearless, and Clutchless\\" which was indeed true. The engine for the first vehicles was an air-cooled 3-cylinder \\"porcupine head\\" two cycle engine which the owner needed to prepare a mixture of fuel and oil in order to run. The vehicle's transmission was a friction drive, consisting of a flat spinning flywheel mounted on the engine which was set at right angles to a rubber lined steel drive wheel which slid from side to side on a drive shaft mounted in parallel to the rear axle. Sprockets on the end of the drive shaft relayed power to the rear wheels via a pair of chains, one per wheel. The friction drive was prone to slippage due to environmental conditions (water) and if the rubber drive wheel was allowed to rest against the spinning flywheel for a long period of time it would develop a flat spot which would produce an uneven power transfer. The transmission was infinitely variable, however, allowing the user to simply progressively slide the rubber covered wheel from a neutral position at the center of the flywheel to a position closer to the edge of the flywheel to vary the gear ratio. Automobile The introduction of the LuLu automobile in 1914 marked a change in engineering for the vehicle. The two cycle engine was discarded in favor of the more reliable 4-stroke engine and a clutch and 3-speed transmission replaced the friction drive. World War I caused the company to cease production. However, after the Great War, the company resumed production but shifted to making mostly trucks, including fire trucks.

Biography  Nekrasov was born in Moscow. A journalist, he worked in the publishing house Moscow worker. He learned Esperanto in 1915.  Esperanto activity, editorial work, and articles  In 1918‚Äì19, he was president of the Tutrusia Ligo de junaj esperantistoj (All-Russia League of Young Esperantists), and editor and typesetter of Juna Mondo (Young World). On 1 June 1922 Nekrasov together with Gregory Demidyuk founded the cultural review La Nova Epoko (The New Epoch), which became one of the organs of SAT. In 1923 he became a member of the Central Committee of Sovetlanda Esperantista Unuiƒùo (SEU) (ru: Soyuz Esperantistov Sovetskikh Stran), then under the leadership of Ernest Drezen. He was especially concerned with the history and criticism of Esperanto literature, the ideology of the proletarian revolutionary Esperanto movement, the nationality problem and cosmoglottics. In La Nova Epoko he published several essays on Esperanto literature (about Baghy, Bulthuis, Jung, Hohlov, Mikhalski, Devkin, Schulhof, and others). His critiques set out mainly from an original sociological viewpoint, but he simultaneously paid much attention to the use of language in the works. In the early 1930s he actively participated in the compilation and preparation of material on literature for the Enciklopedio de Esperanto. He also published many of Zamenhof's letters. In 1931 he was one of the cofounders of IAREV (International Association of Revolutionary Esperanto Writers), and edited its first newspaper, La Nova Etapo (The New Stage).  Arrest, execution, and rehabilitation  Nekrasov was arrested in 1938, and accused of being \\"an organizer and leader of a fascist, espionage, terrorist organization of Esperantists\\". For this crime he was shot to death on 4 October 1938. His archive and library were obliterated; presumably many of his unpublished works and translations thus perished.

This includes planning and tracking of schedules and mileposts, cost and revenue, resource allocation, as well as overall management of these project elements. Efficiency is improved by eliminating manual processes, like spreadsheet tracking to monitor project progress. It also allows for at-a-glance status updates and ideally integrates with existing legacy applications in order to unify ongoing projects, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and broader organizational goals. There are a lot of logistic elements in a project. Different team members are responsible for managing each element and often, the organisation may have a mechanism to manage some logistic areas as well. By coordinating these various components of project management, workforce management and financials through a single solution, the process of configuring and changing project and workforce details is simplified.  Introduction  A project workforce management system defines project tasks, project positions, and assigns personnel to the project positions. The project tasks and positions are correlated to assign a responsible project position or even multiple positions to complete each project task. Because each project position may be assigned to a specific person, the qualifications and availabilities of that person can be taken into account when determining the assignment. By associating project tasks and project positions, a manager can better control the assignment of the workforce and complete the project more efficiently. When it comes to project workforce management, it is all about managing all the logistic aspects of a project or an organisation through a software application. Usually, this software has a workflow engine defined. Therefore, all the logistic processes take place in the workflow engine.  About   Technical field  This invention relates to project management systems and methods, more particularly to a software-based system and method for project and workforce management.  Software usage  Due to the software usage, all the project workflow management tasks can be fully automated without leaving many tasks for the project managers. This returns high efficiency to the project management when it comes to project tracking proposes. In addition to different tracking mechanisms, project workforce management software also offer a dashboard for the project team. Through the dashboard, the project team has a glance view of the overall progress of the project elements. Most of the times, project workforce management software can work with the existing legacy software systems such as ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems. This easy integration allows the organisation to use a combination of software systems for management purposes.  Background  Good project management is an important factor for the success of a project. A project may be thought of as a collection of activities and tasks designed to achieve a specific goal of the organisation, with specific performance or quality requirements while meeting any subject time and cost constraints. Project management refers to managing the activities that lead to the successful completion of a project. Furthermore, it focuses on finite deadlines and objectives. A number of tools may be used to assist with this as well as with assessment. Project management may be used when planning personnel resources and capabilities. The project may be linked to the objects in a professional services life cycle and may accompany the objects from the opportunity over quotation, contract, time and expense recording, billing, period-end-activities to the final reporting. Naturally the project gets even more detailed when moving through this cycle. For any given project, several project tasks should be defined. Project tasks describe the activities and phases that have to be performed in the project such as writing of layouts, customising, testing. What is needed is a system that allows project positions to be correlated with project tasks. Project positions describe project roles like project manager, consultant, tester, etc. Project-positions are typically arranged linearly within the project. By correlating project tasks with project positions, the qualifications and availability of personnel assigned to the project positions may be considered.  Benefits of project management  Good project management should: * Reduce the chance of a project failing * Ensure a minimum level of quality and that results meet requirements and expectations * Free up other staff members to get on with their area of work and increase efficiency both on the project and within the business * Make things simpler and easier for staff with a single point of contact running the overall project * Encourage consistent communications amongst staff and suppliers * Keep costs, timeframes and resources to budget  Workflow engine  When it comes to project workforce management, it is all about managing all the logistic aspects of a project or an organisation through a software application. Usually, this software has a workflow engine defined in them. So, all the logistic processes take place in the workflow engine. The regular and most common types of tasks handled by project workforce management software or a similar workflow engine are:  Planning and monitoring project schedules and milestones  Regularly monitoring your project's schedule performance can provide early indications of possible activity-coordination problems, resource conflicts, and possible cost overruns. To monitor schedule performance. Collecting information and evaluating it ensure a project accuracy. The project schedule outlines the intended result of the project and what's required to bring it to completion. In the schedule, we need to include all the resources involved and cost and time constraints through a work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS outlines all the tasks and breaks them down into specific deliverables.  Tracking the cost and revenue aspects of projects  The importance of tracking actual costs and resource usage in projects depends upon the project situation. Tracking actual costs and resource usage is an essential aspect of the project control function.  Resource utilisation and monitoring  Organisational profitability is directly connected to project management efficiency and optimal resource utilisation. To sum up, organisations that struggle with either or both of these core competencies typically experience cost overruns, schedule delays and unhappy customers. The focus for project management is the analysis of project performance to determine whether a change is needed in the plan for the remaining project activities to achieve the project goals. Other management aspects of project management  Project risk management  Risk identification consists of determining which risks are likely to affect the project and documenting the characteristics of each.  Project communication management  Project communication management is about how communication is carried out during the course of the project  Project quality management  It is of no use completing a project within the set time and budget if the final product is of poor quality. The project manager has to ensure that the final product meets the quality expectations of the stakeholders. This is done by good: * Quality planning: Identifying what quality standards are relevant to the project and determining how to meet them. * Quality assurance: Evaluating overall project performance on a regular basis to provide confidence that the project will satisfy the relevant quality standards. * Quality control: Monitoring specific project results to determine if they comply with relevant quality standards and identifying ways to remove causes of poor performance. Project workforce management vs. traditional management There are three main differences between Project Workforce Management and traditional project management and workforce management disciplines and solutions:  Workflow-driven  All project and workforce processes are designed, controlled and audited using a built-in graphical workflow engine. Users can design, control and audit the different processes involved in the project. The graphical workflow is quite attractive for the users of the system and allows the users to have a clear idea of the workflow engine.  Organisation and work breakdown structures  Project Workforce Management provides organization and work breakdown structures to create, manage and report on functional and approval hierarchies, and to track information at any level of detail. Users can create, manage, edit and report work breakdown structures. Work breakdown structures have different abstraction levels, so the information can be tracked at any level. Usually, project workforce management has approval hierarchies. Each workflow created will go through several records before it becomes an organisational or project standard. This helps the organisation to reduce the inefficiencies of the process, as it is audited by many stakeholders.  Connected project, workforce and financial processes  Unlike traditional disconnected project, workforce and billing management systems that are solely focused on tracking IT projects, internal workforce costs or billable projects, Project Workforce Management is designed to unify the coordination of all project and workforce processes, whether internal, shared (IT) or billable.  Summary  A project workforce management system defines project tasks, project positions and assigns personnel to the project positions. The project tasks and project positions are correlated to assign a responsible project position or positions to complete each project task. Because each project position may be assigned to a specific person, the qualification and availabilities of the person can be taken into account when determining the assignment. By correlating the project tasks and project positions, a manager can better control the assignment of the workforce and complete projects more efficiently. Project workflow management is one of the best methods for managing different aspects of project. If the project is complex, then the outcomes for the project workforce management could be more effective. For simple projects or small organisations, project workflow management may not add much value, but for more complex projects and big organisations, managing project workflow will make a big difference. This is because that small organisations or projects do not have a significant overhead when it comes to managing processes. There are many project workforce management, but many organisations prefer to adopt unique solutions. Therefore, organisation gets software development companies to develop custom project workflow managing systems for them. This has proved to be the most suitable way of getting the best project workforce management system acquired for the company.

They are useful in many problems of geometric analysis due to their regularity properties. In two dimensions, certain harmonic coordinates known as isothermal coordinates have been studied since the early 1800s. Harmonic coordinates in higher dimensions were developed initially in the context of Lorentzian geometry and general relativity by Albert Einstein and Cornelius Lanczos (see harmonic coordinate condition). Following the work of Dennis DeTurck and Jerry Kazdan in 1981, they began to play a significant role in the geometric analysis literature, although Idzhad Sabitov and S.Z. ≈†efel had made the same discovery five years earlier. Definition Let be a Riemannian manifold of dimension . One says that a coordinate chart , defined on an open subset of , is harmonic if each individual coordinate function is a harmonic function on . That is, one requires that :\\\\Delta^g x^i = 0.\\\\, where is the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator. Trivially, the coordinate system is harmonic if and only if, as a map , the coordinates are a harmonic map. A direct computation with the local definition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator shows that is a harmonic coordinate chart if and only if :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^ng^{ij}\\\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0\\\\text{ for all }k=1,\\\\ldots,n, in which are the Christoffel symbols of the given chart. Relative to a fixed \\"background\\" coordinate chart , one can view as a collection of functions on an open subset of Euclidean space. The metric tensor relative to is obtained from the metric tensor relative to by a local calculation having to do with the first derivatives of , and hence the Christoffel symbols relative to are calculated from second derivatives of . So both definitions of harmonic coordinates, as given above, have the qualitative character of having to do with second-order partial differential equations for the coordinate functions. Using the definition of the Christoffel symbols, the above formula is equivalent to :2\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^ng^{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{jk}}{\\\\partial x^i}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^ng^{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^k}. Existence and basic theory Harmonic coordinates always exist (locally), a result which follows easily from standard results on the existence and regularity of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations. In particular, the equation has a solution in some open set around any given point , such that and are both prescribed. The basic regularity theorem concerning the metric in harmonic coordinates is that if the components of the metric are in the H√∂lder space when expressed in some coordinate chart, regardless of the smoothnness of the chart itself, then the transition function from that coordinate chart to any harmonic coordinate chart will be in the H√∂lder space . In particular this implies that the metric will also be in relative to harmonic coordinate charts. As was first discovered by Cornelius Lanczos in 1922, relative to a harmonic coordinate chart, the Ricci curvature is given by :R_{ij}=-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{a,b=1}^n g^{ab}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^a\\\\partial x^b}+\\\\partial g\\\\ast\\\\partial g\\\\ast g^{-1}\\\\ast g^{-1}. The fundamental aspect of this formula is that, for any fixed and , the first term on the right-hand side is an elliptic operator applied to the locally-defined function . So it is automatic from elliptic regularity, and in particular the Schauder estimates, that if is and is relative to a harmonic coordinate charts, then is relative to the same chart. More generally, if is (with larger than one) and is relative to some coordinate charts, then the transition function to a harmonic coordinate chart will be , and so will be in harmonic coordinate charts. So, by the previous result, will be in harmonic coordinate charts. As a further application of Lanczos' formula, it follows that an Einstein metric is analytic in harmonic coordinates. In particular, this shows that any Einstein metric on a smooth manifold automatically determines an analytic structure on the manifold, given by the collection of harmonic coordinate charts. Due to the above analysis, in discussing harmonic coordinates it is standard to consider Riemannian metrics which are at least twice-continuously differentiable. However, with the use of more exotic function spaces, the above results on existence and regularity of harmonic coordinates can be extended to settings where the metric has very weak regularity. Harmonic coordinates in asymptotically flat spaces Harmonic coordinates were used by Robert Bartnik to understand the geometric properties of asymptotically flat Riemannian manifolds. Suppose that one has a complete Riemannian manifold , and that there is a compact subset of together with a diffeomorphism from to , such that , relative to the standard Euclidean metric on , has eigenvalues which are uniformly bounded above and below by positive numbers, and such that converges, in some precise sense, to as diverges to infinity. Such a diffeomorphism is known as a structure at infinity or as asymptotically flat coordinates for . Bartnik's primary result is that the collection of asymptotically flat coordinates (if nonempty) has a simple asymptotic structure, in that the transition function between any two asymptotically flat coordinates is approximated, near infinity, by an affine transformation. This is significant in establishing that the ADM energy of an asymptotically flat Riemannian manifold is a geometric invariant which does not depend on a choice of asymptotically flat coordinates. The key tool in establishing this fact is the approximation of arbitrary asymptotically flat coordinates for by asymptotically flat coordinates which are harmonic. The key technical work is in the establishment of a Fredholm theory for the Laplace- Beltrami operator, when acting between certain Banach spaces of functions on which decay at infinity. Then, given any asymptotically flat coordinates , from the fact that :\\\\Delta^g\\\\Phi^k=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n g^{ij}\\\\Gamma_{ij}^k, which decays at infinity, it follows from the Fredholm theory that there are functions which decay at infinity such that , and hence that are harmonic. This provides the desired asymptotically flat harmonic coordinates. Bartnik's primary result then follows from the fact that the vector space of asymptotically-decaying harmonic functions on has dimension , which has the consequence that any two asymptotically flat harmonic coordinates on are related by an affine transformation. Bartnik's work is predicated on the existence of asymptotically flat coordinates. Building upon his methods, Shigetoshi Bando, Atsushi Kasue, and Hiraku Nakajima showed that the decay of the curvature in terms of the distance from a point, together with polynomial growth of the volume of large geodesic balls and the simple- connectivity of their complements, implies the existence of asymptotically flat coordinates. The essential point is that their geometric assumptions, via some of the results discussed below on harmonic radius, give good control over harmonic coordinates on regions near infinity. By the use of a partition of unity, these harmonic coordinates can be patched together to form a single coordinate chart, which is the main objective. Harmonic radius A foundational result, due to Michael Anderson, is that given a smooth Riemannian manifold, any positive number between 0 and 1 and any positive number , there is a number which depends on , on , on upper and lower bounds of the Ricci curvature, on the dimension, and on a positive lower bound for the injectivity radius, such that any geodesic ball of radius less than is the domain of harmonic coordinates, relative to which the size of and the uniform closeness of to the Euclidean metric are both controlled by . This can also be reformulated in terms of \\"norms\\" of pointed Riemannian manifolds, where the -norm at a scale corresponds to the optimal value of for harmonic coordinates whose domains are geodesic balls of radius . Various authors have found versions of such \\"harmonic radius\\" estimates, both before and after Anderson's work. The essential aspect of the proof is the analysis, via standard methods of elliptic partial differential equations, for the Lanczos formula for the Ricci curvature in a harmonic coordinate chart. So, loosely speaking, the use of harmonic coordinates show that Riemannian manifolds can be covered by coordinate charts in which the local representations of the Riemannian metric are controlled only by the qualitative geometric behavior of the Riemannian manifold itself. Following ideas set forth by Jeff Cheeger in 1970, one can then consider sequences of Riemannian manifolds which are uniformly geometrically controlled, and using the coordinates, one can assemble a \\"limit\\" Riemannian manifold. Due to the nature of such \\"Riemannian convergence\\", it follows, for instance, that up to diffeomorphism there are only finitely many smooth manifolds of a given dimension which admit Riemannian metrics with a fixed bound on Ricci curvature and diameter, with a fixed positive lower bound on injectivity radius. Such estimates on harmonic radius are also used to construct geometrically-controlled cutoff functions, and hence partitions of unity as well. For instance, to control the second covariant derivative of a function by a locally-defined second partial derivative, it is necessary to control the first derivative of the local representation of the metric. Such constructions are fundamental in studying the basic aspects of Sobolev spaces on noncompact Riemannian manifolds.

She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in the 1970s and got involved in political theater as both a creative and management member of the Plutonium Players troupe. She was a principal in their long-touring satirical show spoofing anti-feminist politics, Ladies Against Women, throughout the years of the Ronald Reagan presidency. The show was inspired in part by the anti-feminist campaigns of Phyllis Schlafly, who was parodied by the troupe as Phyllis LeShaft. In the same period the troupe created the \\"Reagan for Shah Campaign,\\" featuring numerous fictional constituent organizations of which Ladies Against Women was the most popular. The show toured the East and West Coasts in 1980 and performed outside the Republican Convention in Dallas in 1984. Both Ladies Against Women and Reagan for Shah were cited by Andrew Boyd as helping to inspire his Billionaires for Bush theatrical project. In December 1991, she joined the management team of the prototypic online community, The WELL, in the role of community manager. In 1998 she took the post of Executive Director. When The WELL was acquired by Salon.com in 1999, Williams stayed on. Currently she serves as Salon's Director of Communities, overseeing The WELL and Salon's Table Talk community. She is a member of the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. In 2000 Williams was named as one of the Top 25 Women of the Web.

Three months later the company was renamed in SA Italiana per la fabbricazione di Automobili Peugeot Croizat. President of the corporation was Giovanni Goria Gatti. In November 1907, the company was liquidated. Officine Meccaniche Torinese took over the production. The company licensed vehicle designs from Peugeot, implementing their own modifications. The smallest model was the 6 HP, which corresponded to the Peugeot Type 69. However, the displacement of the single-cylinder engine was increased to 695 cc. There was also the 12/16 HP, which was based on the Peugeot Type 71. The four-cylinder engine had 2205 cc. References David Burgess Wise, The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Automobiles.

The party, founded on the platforms of patriotism, Estonian independence, and social justice, wrote the first Estonian constitution. History Social democracy in Estonia was born at the beginning of the 20th century. Estonian social democracy was influenced by western European ideas of social democracy as well as by Russian ideals. During the Russian Revolution of 1905 social democratic ideas spread and Estonian social democrats formed their party in the summer of 1905 in Tartu. At this time, the party was named the Estonian Social Democratic Workers Unity (Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik T√∂√∂liste √úhendus). The social democrats were the most persecuted party during the czarist era. Their newspapers were closed, their politicians were forced to emigrate (Peeter Speek and Mihkel Martna) or prosecute in underground (August Rei). In 1917, when parties were again allowed, social democrats formed the Estonian Social Democratic Association (Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik √úhendus). Their views were patriotic and they fought for Estonian independence and social justice. In 1919, they changed their name to the Estonian Social Democratic Workers Party (Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik T√∂√∂liste Partei) and won the Constituent Assembly elections with 41 of the 120 seats. In the first parliamentary elections the following year the party was reduced to third place, before emerging as the second-largest party in the 1923 elections. In 1925 the party merged with the Estonian Independent Socialist Workers' Party to form the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p579 In 1990, the Estonian Socialist Party's Foreign Association merged into the newly formed Estonian Social Democratic Party.

It is the most common method of execution worldwide, used in about 70 countries, with execution by firing squad being one particular form. In most countries, execution by a firing squad has historically been considered a more honorable death and was used primarily for military personnel, though in some countries‚Äîamong them Belarus, the only state in Europe today that has the death penalty‚Äîthe single executioner shooting inherited from the Soviet past is still in use.  Brazil  Although Brazil abolished the death penalty, it can be used for the occurrence of certain crimes in a period of war, such as betrayal, conspiracy, mutiny, unauthorized retreating in battles and theft of equipment or supplies in a military base. The execution method in this case is execution by shooting. Europe In Belarus executions are performed by a single executioner shooting the back of the head from behind with a pistol.Gypsy Laborer Faces Execution In Belarus CBS News, October 13, 2009 Soviet Bloc  In 20th-century communist states, shooting was a standard form of execution of civilian and military prisoners alike, with the Soviet Union setting an example of the single-executioner approach. The firing squad, with its solemn and lengthy ceremony was used infrequently. The most common method was the firing of a pistol bullet (\\"nine grams of lead\\") into the back of the head. This method was widely used during the Great Purges of the late 1930s at locations outside the major cities, e.g. Krasny Bor near Petrozavodsk, against purportedly anti-social elements, \\"counter-revolutionaries\\" and other Enemies of the People. It was also used in the execution of those who had committed ordinary criminal offences. On occasion, it is said, the person to be executed was led through a series of corridors, not knowing when or where the shot would take place. Even after the breakup of the Soviet Union, people continued to be executed by shooting. Serial killer Andrei Chikatilo was executed in this way in 1994, just before Russia halted use of the death penalty as part of its accession to the Council of Europe. The phrase \\"execution by firing squad\\" is often incorrectly used to translate the Russian term ' ( rasstrel). This, in general, describes any form of shooting, regardless of method, though it is more likely to refer to the single executioner who fires a bullet to the back of the head than to a firing squad. United Kingdom No British citizen has ever been executed for a civilian crime by shooting. A Royal Commission on Capital Punishment considered shooting as a possible alternative to hanging, although the findings published in 1953 concluded shooting was not a sufficiently effective means of execution to justify a switch to the method from hanging. United States Since 1608, about 142 men have been judicially shot in the United States and its English-speaking predecessor territories, excluding executions related to the American Civil War.M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smylka's database, \\"Executions in the U.S. 1608-2002: The Espy File.\\" (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research)  Asia  An execution by shooting in Shanghai in 1948 * Bahrain uses firing squads for execution. * In the People's Republic of China, shooting as a method of execution takes two typical formats, either a pistol shot in the back of the head or neck or a shot by a rifle in either the back or the back of the head from behind. Some more recent executions have been private and carried out using lethal injection, though shooting is still more frequently used. Hong Kong abolished the death penalty and Macau never had the death penalty prior to the handover, and neither restored it when they returned to Chinese sovereignty. * In India, during the Mughal rule, soldiers who committed crimes were executed by being strapped to a cannon which was then fired. This was known as blowing from a gun. This method, invented by the Mughals, was continued by the British who used it to execute native deserters and mutineers, especially after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.# ^ Sahib: The British Soldier in India 1750-1914 Richard Holmes HarperCollins 2005 It is no longer practiced in the Republic of India, having been replaced by long drop hanging. * In Indonesia, capital punishment is administered by a firing squad which aims for the heart. * In Mongolia, the method of execution before abolition in 2012 was a bullet to the back of a head‚ÄúLe pr√©sident mongol veut abolir la peine de mort‚Äù, Le Monde, January 14, 2009 from a .38 caliber revolver, a method inherited from Soviet legislation.

Before the execution, the prisoner is injected with a strong anesthetic to leave them completely senseless (see capital punishment in Taiwan). * In Thailand from 1934 until 2003, a single executioner would shoot the convict in the back from a mounted machine gun.

The host unit is the 139th Airlift Wing, Missouri Air National Guard. Founded in 1983, the AATTC was the brainchild of Major Howard W. Dixon, a pilot who sought the need to establish low level combat survival training and maneuvers for C-130 aircrews; as well as the airlift community as a whole. This evasive aerial survival training had been exclusive to the fighter community up until the establishment of the AATTC, which would expand this training to C-130 aircrews. The school would continue to evolve with the combined efforts of the technicians, AGR's and members of the 180th Airlift Squadron.  Mission  The mission of the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center (AATTC) is increasing the warfighting effectiveness and survivability of mobility forces. The AATTC is entering its fourth decade of providing advanced tactical training to airlift aircrews from the Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, Air Mobility Command, Air Combat Command, Pacific Air Force, United States Air Forces in Europe, Air Force Special Operations Command, United States Marine Corps, and 18 allied nations. Through a Total Force Initiative, AATTC also provides Tactics Analysis, Tactics Development, and Electronic Warfare Development for the AMC, ANG, & AFRC mobility community. AATTC is also the office of primary responsibility for AMC‚Äôs tactics improvement process. The AATTC functions as a clearinghouse for gathering and disseminating airlift tactics information. Since 1983, the AATTC has hosted an annual tactics symposium in St. Joseph, MO. Attendees from all branches of the Department of Defense as well as government contractors and numerous allied nations are represented. Serving as the cornerstone for aircraft tactics, the AATTC has maintained a reputation as the mobility air force‚Äôs ‚ÄúTactics Center of Excellence‚Äù since its inception.  Advanced Tactics Aircrew Course (ATAC) (formerly the Aircrew Course) The AATTC offers a nine-day Aircrew Course. The academic phase is designed to familiarize the crewmember with the basic principles and tactics for operating an airlift aircraft in a hostile environment. Platform instruction is one method used to teach the basic and advanced concepts to crewmembers. The ground training includes briefings on Air/Ground Operations, Low Level Employment, Low Level Awareness Training, Low Level Dynamics, Structures, Enemy Air/Ground Threats, Tactical Formation Maneuvering, and other ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù areas. Additionally, instructors constantly reinforce the learning objectives during mission planning and in-flight. This, in conjunction with the simulated hostile environment scenario flying sorties, will generate the familiarization required to promote mission success and increase the individual crewmember's ability to survive actual hostile environment missions. The flying training consists of two primary phases, The Eastern Phase (Missouri) and the Western Phase (Arizona). The Eastern Phase consists of two low level tactical missions during which, the aircrews are scheduled to airdrop one actual Heavy Equipment (HE) load and one actual High Velocity Container Delivery System (Hi-V CDS) bundle. The Western Phase consists of two Low Level Awareness Training (LLAT) sorties, one Dissimilar Defensive Maneuvering (DDM) sortie, two Low Level Navigation Training (LLNT) sorties and one Hostile Environment Training (HET) sortie. Actual airdrops and actual combat off/on loads (COL) are also incorporated into the Western phase. During both phases the aircrews fly against simulated SAM and AAA ground threats, as well as actual air threats. Audiovisual personnel record the evasive maneuvering of the response to the simulated threats on videotape which is used to provide feedback to the aircrews during debriefings. The AATTC also trains qualified USMC and Special Operations Forces (SOF) aircrews. These SOF aircrews include MC-130 Combat Talon, AC-130 Spectre gunship aircrews and Combat Search and Rescue HC-130 Air Rescue Service . The AATTC also trains USAF and AFRC C-17 aircrews, C-130(H)(J) aircrews from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, as well as C-160 crews from Germany, G-222 crews from Italy AND C295 crews from Spain. The AATTC course is listed in AFC 36-2223 (USAF Formal Schools Catalog) as AATTC - Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center and is assigned PDS code 6S4.  Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Courses  The purpose of this course is to educate the student regarding night vision goggle (NVG) design considerations and operational applications. In the process, the student should gain an appreciation of their limitations as well as their capabilities. The goal of this course is for the student to acquire knowledge that will enhance the level of learning during simulator and/or flight training. The goal from all NVG training is to prepare the aircrew to fly the NVG mission safely and effectively. Airland - This training program is designed to allow C-130 single ship NVG operations flown in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) to reduced overt or covert lit airfields using normal landing and takeoff procedures. Assault procedures are not used. Aircraft must be equipped with NVG lighting or modified with a temporary NVG lighting harness. The academic phase of the NVG Airland Course addresses C-130 specific considerations, NVG mission planning, and route study. These include a complete review of the AMC Airland Checklist, thoroughly planning all aspects of NVG Airland (departure, arrival, go-around, random steep, etc.), calculation of the airfield MSA and when to use it and identification of all potential obstacles with specific means of avoidance. We stress that the crews determine a go-around point for all landings. We also focus on interior and exterior aircraft lighting, cultural lighting, and CRM. Ground Operations is also incorporated in the Airland Operations Training program. The flying training is conducted at our Arizona location and consists of two sorties. Emphasis in-flight is on crew coordination, checklist usage, and a discussion on emergency procedures. The profiles include multiple NVG Takeoffs/Landings, Visual Straight-Ins, NVG ARAs, NVG Go-Arounds and Random Steeps. NVG Assault Operations - The AATTC has received approval from Air Mobility Command (AMC), National Guard Bureau (NGB), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) to conduct NVG Assault training. The training involves both ground and flight training and covers the following areas: * Objective area analysis * Altitude Planning * Tactical Approaches * Energy Management * Tactical Considerations * Crew Resource Management (CRM) Techniques * Emergency Procedures ***This course is no longer offered by the AATTC***  Intelligence Formal Training Unit (IFTU) Course  The AATTC C-130 Intelligence Formal Training Unit (IFTU) Course is designed to prepare C-130 Intelligence personnel with the skills and knowledge required to immediately support C-130 operations upon arrival at their unit. The students get an in-depth indoctrination in the C-130 Weapon System to include Defensive Systems and Night Vision Devices employment. Students closely interact with C-130 aircrews attending the Aircrew Course and are able to fly on tactical training sorties. The course is conducted at three locations, beginning with a visit to the Threat Working Group, TACC, and AMC/IN at Scott AFB, IL, it continues at the AATTC in St Joseph, MO, and finally at the AATTC Facility at Ft Huachuca, AZ. The course length is 2 weeks 5 days, including two travel days. The C-130 IFTU Course is open to intelligence personnel currently assigned to a C-130 unit with less than one year time on station, or personnel identified for assignment to a C-130 unit. The course is open to intelligence personnel assigned to the Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command and Active Duty. The applicants must also be graduates of the Intelligence School at Goodfellow AFB or comparable AFSC awarding course, and have a valid SECRET security clearance. **** This Course is no longer offered at the AATTC ****  Practical Intelligence Course (PIC)  Our Practical Intelligence Course (PIC) program is designed to provide aircrews and Intelligence support personnel with ground and flight training, which will enhance the aircrews' chances for survival and mission success within hostile flying environments. It gives AMC intelligence personnel mission oriented academics and planning exercise as well as the experience of working closely with aircrews and flying on tactical missions. The goal is to develop and enhance individual intelligence skills to ensure their contribution as a member of the tactics-operations-intelligence team. AMC intelligence personnel will be well-trained professionals in partnership with tactics and operations functions. This course fills a vital need in the intelligence training cycle. The first week of instruction is set in the classroom and is used to explore the different avenues of intelligence as it pertains to the airlift community. The second week of instruction demonstrates the practical application of intelligence by integrating the intelligence students with the airlift crews. This gives the opportunity for the intelligence students and the aircrew to exchange information. This training includes: Preparation for Deployments, Message Processing, Debriefing and Reporting, Military Airlift Capabilities & C-130 Safety, a Situation briefing exercise, a mission briefing exercise, and other ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù areas. The PIC attendees will provide the intelligence scenario and then accompany the crew on the mission. This provides the PIC attendees with a valuable insight as to how the airlift aircrews use intelligence information to accomplish their mission. In addition to teaching the specific items listed in the curriculum this course strives to develop a \\"total\\" intelligence person by developing their leadership skills, instilling confidence, and directing their energy to provide high quality intelligence support to their unit. **** This course is no longer offered at the AATTC **** External links * 139th Airlift Wing - AATTC website * - Press release on Lt.

The site was unearthed in 1977 by Iranian archeologists headed by Ehsan Yaghmaihttp://www.tavoosonline.com/News/NewsDetailEn.aspx?src=16503 Further excavations at the site in 2005 led to a fragmentary sculpture featuring the head of the Achaemenid emperor Darius the Great (r. 521 BC-485 BC) with a servant carrying an umbrella behind him as well as four pieces of gold in the form of thick folded sheets with a combined weight of about three kilograms buried beside one of the main hall‚Äôs columns. Yaghmaii said he believed the gold sheets may have inscriptions on them and may have been deliberately folded and hidden during antiquity.http://www.tavoosonline.com/News/NewsDetailEn.aspx?src=16503 An inscription was also recovered with handwriting in the Neo-Babylonian language.http://www.tavoosonline.com/News/NewsDetailEn.aspx?src=16503 The capitals of the palace had been decorated with the images of eagles and lions. The eagle was a symbol of power and wisdom during the Achaemenid era. Pieces of the capitals, including eyes, wings, fangs, and snouts, have been discovered during previous excavations. Such images can be seen at Persepolis as well. Six bronze coins were also discovered beside the statue as well as some ornaments made of ivory and several fragments of lapis lazuli and ironstone with the handle. The archaeological team began the excavations in early winter under the supervision of Yaghmaii, whose earlier team had discovered the Darius Palace in 1977. Darius' Palace is somewhat similar to the Apadana Palace in Persepolis. The palace had 36 columns. Sixteen bases of the columns were unearthed during the first phase of the excavations. Each column rose to about 20 to 23 meters. Built during the Achaemenids' zenith, the palace had been destroyed by fire in a war.

Players take on the role of European countries sending expeditions to find gold and establish colonies. Although the design uses the trappings of board wargames such as a hex map, combat is not a major part of the game. It was designed by Richard Berg and originally published by Simulations Publications, Inc. as Conquistador! in 1976, then republished by Avalon Hill in 1981.  Game play  The basic game can be played by two to four players, representing the activities of Spain, England, France or Portugal. The game also includes a solitaire scenario where Spain is played by a single player, and the original SPI edition included optional rules for an additional player to take a purely financial role as the German bankers. The map includes the entire Americas and has a variety of terrain types such as clear, rough, and jungle. it is divided into areas such as Patagonia and California, each with ratings reflecting the hostility and fertility of the environment and the attitude of native inhabitants to European settlement. Game counters include soldiers, colonists, missionaries, carracks, caravels, galleon fleets, and gold bars, along with individual named explorers, privateers, and conquistadors. Each turn represents five years, with the first turn beginning in 1495 and the game ending in 1600. Each turn consists of five phases, each of which is in turn divided into several segments. * The Royal Council phase is focused on planning, beginning with a Random Events segment which determines money and colonist availability, as well as unforeseen events such as plague or unusual requirements such as searching for the Seven Cities of Cibola or El Dorado. The players also determine the order of play for the remainder of the turn and plan their expeditions, purchasing materials and forces and recording the composition and destination of each expedition. * In the Initial Naval phase, players move their expeditions to and from the New World. They may also move within the New World, possibly engaging in naval combat or invasions, after which all expeditions check for possible losses due to attrition. * Segments of the Land phase include attempts to discover gold and production from existing gold mines, movement and combat of land units, combat with natives, attrition of land units, and collection of resources. * The Final Naval phase consists of another opportunity to move expeditions to or from Europe, followed by attrition checks and credit for discoveries made by expeditions which have reached a friendly port. * In the Maintenance phase, players pay for units which will be kept in play for the next turn.  Assessment  Since the map is already displayed, game play does not involve actual exploration of unknown territory, unlike other contemporary board games such as Source of the Nile. Instead, players are rewarded for being the first to reach different regions and return safely. The most significant route to victory in the game is to establish viable colonies, which is not straightforward as turn-by-turn attrition as well as actions of European or native enemies can wipe them out entirely. Writing in 1980, Jon Freeman says that Conquistador \\"may be the best of Richard Berg's designs\\", and that while \\"too cynically realistic\\" in favoring colony development over the glamour of exploration, it is nevertheless \\"a lot of fun\\". A much simplified version of the game, \\"New World\\", was published by the Avalon hill Game Company c.1990. It allowed for up[ to 6 players, and for a blank map in which the terrain/climate was revealed as players entered the various areas.

In 1949, he moved to the Physics department at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, under the direction of Giulio Trabacchi, whom he succeeded in the position of head of department in 1959. With the collaboration of Franco Graziosi, he devoted the activities of the department to biophysics. Thanks to his collaboration with Adriano Buzzati-Traverso, Ageno taught at the University of Pavia in 1960-1961, and became a member of the first scientific council of Traverso's Laboratorio Internazionale di Genetica e Biofisica. He left the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† for the University of Rome La Sapienza in 1969, to accept the first professorship in Biophysics in Italian history. Becoming famed for his strictness with students, he continued his research in the university setting, focusing on mathematical and physical models for bacterial growth, developing a complex view on the relationships between physics and biology, which are summed up in his book Che cos'√® la vita?

History Scientific Time Sharing Corporation's former headquarters in Washington, D.C. Scientific Time Sharing Corporation (STSC) was formed in 1969 in Bethesda, Maryland by Dan Dyer, Burton C. Gray, and some of the people who originally implemented the programming language APL, notably Philip S. Abrams, Lawrence M. Breed, and Allen Rose.Burton C. Gray's Yale obituary In 1970, STSC released APL*Plus, a version of the APL\\\\360 language with many practical extensions oriented toward fostering business use of APL. Together with I. P. Sharp Associates, STSC made many enhancements to the APL language, including: * []FMT formatting * []VR and []FX, APL program reflection features * a file system to store APL variables outside of the APL environment STSC continued to make enhancements to the interpreter, notably improving the performance of many of the primitive functions. In 1985, Dan Dyer of STSC and Ian Sharp of I. P. Sharp Associates jointly received the Kenneth E. Iverson Award for Outstanding Contribution to APL. In the early 1980s, the timesharing market began collapsing, mostly due to the appearance in the marketplace of relatively lower cost IBM mainframe computers, such as the IBM 4300. STSC quickly changed its focus to supply APL services for in-house and the rapidly developing personal computer (PC) market. In 1982, STSC released APL*Plus/PC, which was a very successful APL interpreter for the IBM personal computer. In the mid 1980s, STSC developed the APL*Plus/Unix interpreter, a full 32-bit interpreter which was the basis of further APL development, notably APL*Plus/386, which was later available for Intel 386 class machines and higher. Arguably, the APL*Plus/386 interpreter fostered the exodus of APL applications from mainframe to PC environments, as the hardware and software were finally correctly matched to facilitate a straightforward migration of medium- to large-sized applications away from mainframes. In the mid 1980s, STSC released an APL compiler for its APL*Plus add-on for the IBM VSAPL License Program Product. Along with language features designed to profile code execution, this compiler implementation was oriented toward replacing resource-consuming functions in place with compiled ones, leading to overall performance improvements. By the mid 1990s, the APL*Plus/386 system had become one of the leading APL interpreters in the market, however it did not run under the then-new Microsoft Windows 3.1. Although there were some attempts at Windows interoperability, development on the APL*Plus/Win product began shortly before the APL products were sold to LEX2000. This latest Windows product is the basis for the current APLNow (formerly APL2000) interpreter product line.

Some 11,000 free blacks and escaped slaves were trained here, including 8,612 from Pennsylvania, the most black troops recruited during the war from any northern state.Rappold, Scott, \\"Rare Civil War flag up for auction,\\" York (Pa.) Sunday News, March 7, 2004. History After Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, many freed blacks stepped forward to fight in the army. Thousands of ex-slaves and free blacks displayed a desire to prove they were citizens, like the soldiers currently fighting the war. Often blacks who enlisted were treated rudely and were turned away. Camp William Penn became the \\"training camp for colored troops enlisted into the United States Army.\\" USCT recruiting poster Philadelphia thumb|left|26th United States Colored Volunteer Infantry at Camp William Penn, 1865. From the collection of the National Archives and Records Administration. The family of Lucretia Mott, an abolitionist and women's rights advocate, leased land they owned to the Federal government so that a training camp could be established there. This parcel was located in Chelten Hills in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, just outside the city limits of Philadelphia. Originally, the camp was to be named after Lincoln's Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, but, when final plans were approved, the camp was named William Penn. All of the troops at Camp William Penn were black volunteers who came from a number of states. Lt.Col. Louis Wagner, who was recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Chancellorsville, volunteered to take command of the camp in early 1863. The camp was the largest federal training facility for African-American soldiers. The camp, which was fully operational by July 4, 1863, served as the training ground for eleven regiments, nearly 11,000 men, in its two years of existence. Local antagonists closely observed the activities at Camp William Penn. Many worried that black recruits might defy government authority. When Frederick Douglass entered the grounds to speak with the black recruits, he observed some disturbing activities. Douglass noted black recruits being punished for various military infractions and was deeply disturbed. Many of these recruits were men who already bore the scars of slavery. Douglass told the troops: \\"You are a spectacle for men and angels. You are in a manner to answer the question, can the black man be a soldier? That we can now make soldiers of these men there can be no doubt.\\"The History Net Because of continuing racism, the black troops were not treated equally. Many soldiers complained of harsh treatment. Still, Camp William Penn symbolized an advancement of importance for African- Americans. Although the white community seemed to lack tolerance for the soldiers, Colonel Wagner insisted that his black soldiers ignore segregationist policies. Confederate soldiers hated commanders of black regiments and when black troops were taken prisoner, the commanders were often executed with their men. Famed black artist David Bustill Bowser designed and painted the regimental flag of the 6th United States Colored Infantry Regiment, who trained at the camp. The flag depicted \\"the Goddess of Liberty holding a flag while exhorting a freedman dressed as a soldier to do his duty.\\" He also designed the flag of the 45th United States Colored Infantry Regiment. The regiment's flag shows an image depicting an African American soldier, representing the 45th United States Colored Troops, standing next to bust statue of George Washington.One cause, one country - 45th Regt.

It was built for Ferdinando Gorges, descendant of the founder of the Province of Maine, and a trader in slaves and sugar. Noted for its interior plasterwork, the house is a Grade I listed building. History Ferdinando Gorges (c.1565-1647) was an English soldier whose establishment of the Province of Maine saw him called the \\"Father of English Colonization in North America\\". His descendant, also Ferdinando, bought the Eye estate in 1673 and began building the house shortly thereafter. A datestone above the main doorway carries a date of 1680. Coats of arms within the house carry the insignia of Gorges and of his wife, Meliora Gorges, n√©e Hilliard. Gorges' son, Henry sat as a member of parliament for Herefordshire in the early 18th century. In the 20th century Eye Manor was the home of the publisher Christopher Sandford, who owned the Golden Cockerel Press, and his wife Lettice Sandford. Their son Jeremy Sandford, the writer and director of the television drama Cathy Come Home, grew up at the house. Following his death in 2003, the manor was sold. In 2009 the house was bought by the Conservative politician Robert Jenrick for ¬£1.1 million. In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Jenrick, then serving as the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, became the subject of media interest when he visited the house, and his parents' home in Shrewsbury, in apparent contravention of the government's advice against non-essential travel. Architecture and description Eye Manor is noted for the quality of its interior decoration, which Pevsner describes as \\"an astonishing surprise\\". The house is built of red brick to a traditional double-pile plan. Later additions include the doric porch which dates from the 18th century, and some minor modification undertaken in the early 20th century. It is of two storeys, with cellars and attics. The plain exterior conceals the spectacular interior which has \\"gorgeously enriched\\" panelling, bolection moulded stone fireplaces and \\"outstanding\\" plaster ceilings. The quality and style of the plasterwork in the house bears similarities to that at Holyrood Palace which led Geoffrey Beard, a historian of English decorative arts, to suggest that the same craftsmen may have been involved. Eye Manor is a Grade I listed building.

Plot The story follows relationship between Walt, a gay store clerk, and two younger Mexican boys, Johnny and Roberto Pepper. Walt and his female friend convince them to come over for dinner, but Johnny and Pepper have to return to their cheap hotel because another friend is locked out. Walt makes his first pass at Johnny by offering him $15 to sleep with him. Johnny refuses and runs to his hotel room, leaving Roberto locked out with nowhere to spend the night but Walt's. Settling for second best, Walt lies down next to Pepper and allows him on top for sex. However, he does not give up on trying to win over Johnny.

History Cape Otway was originally inhabited by the Gadubanud people; evidence of their campsites is contained in the middens throughout the region. The cape was discovered by Europeans when Lieutenant James Grant made the first west-to-east passage through Bass Strait in the Lady Nelson in December 1800. Grant named it Cape Albany Otway after Captain William Albany Otway. This was later shortened to Cape Otway. Cape Otway Lighthouse was built on the point of the cape in 1848. The lighthouse is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. A telegraph office opened in 1859. The post office opened on 1 September 1880 and closed in 1972. Eight ships were wrecked along the coast of Cape Otway:Australia's Great Ocean Road:Shipwrecks The Marie (1851), Sacramento (1853), Schomberg (1855), Loch Ard (1878), Joseph H. Scammell (May 1891), Fiji (September 1891), and the Casino in 1932. The first American vessel sunk during World War II, the SS City of Rayville, was also sunk off the cape by a German mine. Following this, the Americans built a radar bunker on the cape in 1942; it is now open to the public. Commercial fisheries The hostile seas, where the Southern Ocean meets with Bass Strait, that surround Cape Otway are home to some of the world's most prized marine species, including crayfish and abalone. On calm days, as many as 20 abalone dive boats commonly operate along the shoreline beneath the lighthouse. Commercial crayfishers use baited pots or traps throughout the reef system, with white floats on the surface marking their locations.

He served as a member of the Legislative Council between 1947 and 1953. Biography Chandra, a graduate of Gurukul Kangri University in India, arrived in Fiji on 22 December 1927 at the behest of the Arya Samaj, which wanted to improve the education standard of Indo-Fijian students and promote Arya Samaj in Fiji. After a brief sojourn at Suva, he started teaching at the Gurukul Primary School in Saweni, Lautoka. In 1928 he became the Principal and under his leadership, boarding facilities were established at the school with 45 boarders out of a total population of 140, including 25 native Fijian students. During his time as Principal, the school made remarkable progress and he was commended by the Governor, Sir Murchison Fletcher. He was the founder of the Fiji Teachers Union in 1929 and its first President. He was mentor of many of the early trade unionists and was the inspiration behind the formation of the Chini Mazdur Sangh (now known as the Sugar General Workers Union) and the Gold Mine Workers Union of Vatukoula.Sir Vijay R. Singh, Speaking Out, Knightsbrook Publications, 2006, He was seen as a person who could be trusted by all sections of the Indian community, and when the Kisan Sangh split into two factions in 1943, both sides agreed to have the union's books audited by him.A.P. Sharma, A History of Fiji Kisan Sangh, Vicas Press, Lautoka, Fiji, 2005 He was the president of the Fiji Industrial Workers Congress (now the Fiji Trades Union Congress), an umbrella organisation representing all but one of the unions in Fiji. He promoted multi-racial trade unions and opposed the participation of any trade union in politics.Industrial associations and local politics. In 1930 Chandra moved to Suva where he was instrumental in the establishment of Arya Samaj Girls School at Samabula. Later, he went to Ba, establishing another school, Arya Kanya Pathshala (Arya Girls School). While in Ba Chandra was also recruited by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) to teach company employees and overseers to speak proper Hindi and understand Indian culture. His greatest contribution was the series of books, Hindi Ki Pothi (Hindi Readers), that he published to enable Indian students to learn Hindi easily. These readers were compiled for students of different levels in primary schools and were used in Fiji for over twenty years. In 1935, with support from CSR, he formed the Ba Indian Football Association with a local league which grew to four teams by 1940.M.

It provides a critical review of enterprise architecture issues in the context of the needs of an organization. Because it provides a \\"big picture\\" view of needs and methods, some enterprise architecture practitioners recommend it as starting point for a business establishing an enterprise architecture unit. Overview The current printable version is marked DRAFT, dated 06-Feb-2004, and edited by Dr Paula J Hagan. It has been approved for public release; distribution unlimited. No updates have been made to any publicly released version of this document since 2004, and the project appears to have been abandoned. Since the most recent publication, the extensions of DODAF, including MODAF, as well as the work at the Object Management Group, have created a model that satisfies both frameworks. Perspective EABOK (and the discipline it describes) is evolving (and partially incomplete). Note: The document is dated 2004-02-06 and marked as draft. That is the last version of the document put out by MITRE. It places enterprise architecture in context. Because there are so many different frameworks and viewpoints about enterprise architecture, it provides a critique of alternatives (such as between the original Zachman Framework, TOGAF and DODAF). The bibliographies are particularly useful. It treats Enterprise Architecture as not including merely diagrams and technical descriptions, but gives a holistic view that includes US legislative requirements and guidance, as well as giving technologists a better understanding of business needs with a quick explanation of the value chain for a business as outlined by Michael Porter. It is worth reading between the lines of many sections, the comments make many experienced information systems and business professionals appreciate the EABOK: while it reviews a range of approaches, it is not frightened to put a personal point of view: Another example of possible implied criticism of some EA practitioners: While many of the references to legislation and guidance are US-centric, the issues and the references are useful to government agencies and businesses across the world.

Life and career H√∂ltt√∂ was born in 1940. In 1955, he started as an apprentice goldsmith with the Helsinki firm of G. Buchert. He studied at the School of Applied Arts, whose vocational evening courses were held in the Ateneum museum building. From then until 1970 he worked at the firm of Westerback; he left after winning the State Photography Prize and set up an advertising company, Ryk√§m√§. The photography for which he is known was almost complete by this point: thereafter, his professional photography left little time for him to pursue his own photographic interests.Elina Heikka, \\"The decisive moment of introducing oneself\\"; within Ismo H√∂ltt√∂, Valokuvia = Photographs (Helsinki: , 2008). The four pages of this prefatory essay are not marked with page numbers, which have been added for this article. H√∂ltt√∂ became interested in photography via two colleagues in the jewelry shop where he worked. He joined the Helsinki Camera Club and became friends with , who had joined at about the same time and was able to give him technical advice. After initial attempts at landscape, H√∂ltt√∂ found his m√©tier: portraiture. He pursued this vigorously, seldom photographing anything else. In summer 1966 H√∂ltt√∂ and Savolainen visited Northern Karelia. They had had light-hearted intentions but found the trip unexpectedly worthwhile, and pursued the work during the coming years. In 1970 Savolainen arranged their work into the photobook Suomea t√§m√§kin, published in time for Christmas. The two continued their partnership, bringing out the books Raportti Suomen mustalaisista (1972) and Vanhuksia (1981), on the Romani people and the elderly respectively. H√∂ltt√∂'s portraiture was complemented by Savolainen's concentration on communities. Soon after becoming seriously interested in photography, H√∂ltt√∂ bought a Rolleiflex medium format twin lens reflex camera, whose design encouraged or even enforced a certain deliberation. From 1968, he added a 35 mm camera; but for the majority of his better-known portraits, his technique was somewhat similar to that of a studio photographer. Such an extensive series of portraits was unprecedented for Finland, and H√∂ltt√∂'s work has sometimes been compared with August Sander's Menschen des 20. Jahrhunderts. But whereas Sander had followed a self-imposed assignment of photographing people having a list of occupations, H√∂ltt√∂ photographed as he wished. H√∂ltt√∂'s photography in Northern Karelia concentrated on smallholders and others on the lower rungs of society, but his coverage in Helsinki was broader, showing middle-class people and even hippies. Together with Savolainen and , H√∂ltt√∂ led social documentary, then the dominant trend of Finnish photography, in the 1970s.Anna Tellgren, \\"Darkness and light: Contemporary Nordic photography\\" (PDF), Scandinavia House, 2014.

When he started documenting the Finnish people, he was only 22; when he ended this series he had turned 31. The reproductions of H√∂ltt√∂'s negatives have changed considerably over time. In the 1960s he favoured high contrast, close cropping, and glossy paper. The early books used duotone offset printing, with little or no space separating the images. His large 1989 book Ihminen p√§√§osassa (Englished in 1991 as People in the Lead Role) used tritone printing for reduced and subtler contrast, with more relaxed cropping.

Its central plot revolves around the 1937 Hindenburg disaster. Henning Bo√´tius is the son of one of the ship's officers, and based his book on accounts his father gave of the disaster. Plot summary Fact and fiction are combined to tell the stories of two fictitious people who were involved in the catastrophe; Birger Lund, a Swedish journalist and passenger on the airship, who apparently suffered horrific injuries in a car accident after the crash; and Edmond Boysen, a member of the crew, who was manning the controls at the time, and seems to have got away unscathed. The book begins some years after the disaster has occurred, as Lund ‚Äì now with a new identity due to a twist of fate ‚Äì is searching for Boysen, who he hopes will provide him with some of the answers that might help him to come to terms with what happened, so that he can move on with his life. However, once the story has introduced Lund, it switches focus to Edmond Boysen, and much of the plot then unfolds against the backdrop of Nazi Germany, when the giant Zeppelin airships dominated the skies and their crew members enjoyed an almost celebrity-like lifestyle. Here the author spends a great deal of time describing the technical aspects of the airship, while its final journey and ultimate demise is told in intricate detail. Birger Lund eventually catches up with Boysen towards the end of the story, and the two have a lengthy discussion as to why the disaster may have happened. They consider a number of theories, including a suggestion that the airship may have been sabotaged. Following this conversation, Lund feels he is able to get some closure and feels he can now start to rebuild his life.

Rizal St., Batingan, Binangonan, Rizal, Philippines. It was founded in 1998. History The Rizal National Science High School first opened for the school year 1998‚Äì99. It was established to provide for more intensive and advanced secondary education program with special reference to science and technology. The establishment of the Rizal National Science High School was conceived and proposed by then Cong. Gilberto M. Duavit of the First District of Rizal who envisioned Rizal to be \\"the knowledge center in Asia\\" in coordination with Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) Division of Rizal under the leadership of the superintendent, Dr. Edith A. Doblada. Congressman Duavit then introduced House Bill No. 3910, for \\"the purpose of establishing a National Science School in Taytay, Rizal to be known as Rizal National Science High School and appropriating funds therefore.\\" Later, Board Members Virgilio Esguerra and Felipe Vital filed Resolution No. 97 ‚Äì 140 requesting Congressman Duavit to transfer the site from Antipolo to Binangonan. On January 19, 1998, Republic Act No. 8724, \\"AN ACT ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF BINANGONAN, PROVINCE OF RIZAL, TO BE KNOWN AS THE RIZAL NATIONAL SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFORE\\"R.A. 8724, Congress of the Philippines was approved. The establishment of RNSHS was in response to DECS Order No. 69, s 1993 where the Department of Education, Culture and Sports encourages the establishment of science high schools, initially among the public high schools in coordination with the Department of Science and Technology starting school year 1994‚àí95. On its initial operation (school year 1998‚àí99), 90 scholars (34 boys and 56 girls), six mentors, and two non-teaching personnel from the local government were housed at the Rizal State College Binangonan Campus under the supervision of Remedios C. Gervacio, head teacher III, and Dr. Remedios G. Aquino, science supervisor, as monitoring official. Three classrooms, one computer laboratory room, one science laboratory room, one library room, one guidance center, one canteen, 10-seat comfort rooms and principal‚Äôs office were on the ground floor of the RSC building. Science equipment, instructional materials like books, charts, audio-visual resources, tables, chairs etc. were given by the DECS Division and Regional offices and the provincial government. Students joined municipal, provincial, regional and national academic competitions and have brought several major awards. Likewise, in the division achievement test, the school ranked first in almost all subjects. On June 4, 1999, before the start of school year 1999‚àí2000, RNSHS moved to its permanent site at Brgy. Batingan occupying the Ynares type building with six classrooms completed, just enough for six sections. In December of school year 2001‚àí02, Genesius Fulgeras took over as the principal. After eight months, Marissa SJ. Gatapia, Education Supervisor I in Secondary Science, was designated as the Officer-in-Charge. From May 2, 2002 to May 15, 2003, Cristina C. Camarse, principal took over from Fulgeras. From May 16, 2003 Elena V. Bernardo has been the principal. Admission In conformance to the Division Memoranda issued by the Division of RizalAdmission - The Official Website of the Rizal National Science High School annually, these are the students who are eligible to take the RiSci entrance examination: * The applicant must belong to the upper 10% of the graduating class in public or private elementary school in: ** Division of Rizal; and ** Any division provided he/she have maintained residency in the Province of Rizal for at least one year before his/her application. Students who seek admission to the school must pass two written examinations. Later, the students must undergo interviews with the school's board of members and faculty. The examination consists of mental ability test and achievement test covering verbal and non-verbal analogy, biology, physics, and mathematics. The first entrance examination is held in January, the second in February, and the interview in March‚ÄìApril. The top 120 students are admitted and announced weeks after the interview process.  Academic regulations   Academic performance requirements  A student should maintain grades of 85% or higher in all the subjects, in every grading period. A grade of 84% or below in any subject, in any grading period of the school year will lead the student to a probationary status. A final grade of 84% (flat) or below in any subject indicates failure.  Grading system  The grades of the students are based on the guidelines and criteria prescribed by the Department of Education. There are four grading periods. The grades in each period are computed based on 'Percentage Distribution of the Components of Students' Grade' (Enclosure no. 2 to DepEd Order no. 33, s. 2004). The final grade for each subject area will be computed by averaging.[A RiScian's Handbook]  Student life  The learning environment of RiScians is not limited to its walls. Students are exposed to extracurricular activities such as science fairs, school press conferences, quiz bees, seminars, training, student organizations and clubs.  Extracurricular activities  RNSHS actively participates annually in contests like Schools Press Conferences, Science Fairs, Essay Writing Contest, Patimpalak ng Sabayang Pagbikas, Speech Choir Competitions, Oratorical and Extemporaneous Speaking, Water Rocket Events, Tagisang Robotics of the Department of Science and Technology, and other events sponsored by schools, government agencies/units and non-government organizations.  Culture   Sablay/Sakbay  Inspired from the University of the Philippines' Sablay, RNSHS has its version of garb worn during commencement exercises. It is worn before the gala (long sleeves) uniform. The colors of the garb were based on the school's colors‚Äîred and green. Running through the sablay are Baybayin figures of the batch number (in Filipino language) of which a member is a graduate.  Mr. and Ms. RiSci  Launched by the RNSHS Parents and Teachers' Association (PTA) annually, Mr. and Ms. RiSci is one of the school's most-awaited event. Its objectives are to showcase the students' beauty, intelligence and talent to the RiSci community and to raise funds for school projects. The pageant is divided into two parts: pre-pageant and coronation. For four consecutive years, the title holders of this pageant were won by the representatives of the twelfth batch.  Family Day  Emphasizing the words Kakaiba ang Pamilyang Iskolar, RNSHS holds its annual Family Day event to strengthen the relationships of the families of students and faculty. It is held in December.

He is best known for being a member of Soft Machine which he joined in 2006 while the group was still using the \\"Legacy\\" suffix and for being a member of Gong from 1999 to 2010. Travis received his degree in music from the University of Manchester specialising in the works of Shostakovich. He has made eleven solo albums, mostly as a band leader working in the field of jazz, composing and arranging most of the material. However, 2003's Slow Life, on which he is the sole performer, is an ambient album employing loops which prefigures his later work with Travis & Fripp. He has made about the same number of albums again credited to himself and one (or occasionally more) other collaborator(s), including John Foxx and, as half of Travis & Fripp, Robert Fripp. On his albums as band leader, Travis has played with numerous other jazz musicians. These have included, on his 2007 album Double Talk, guitarist Mike Outram and organist Pete Whittaker. There was no bassist as such on that album: Whittaker's distinctive keyboard style includes playing bass parts with his left hand. Robert Fripp also guested on two tracks on this album, one of which he co-wrote with Travis. Owing to other collaborative commitments, Travis did not record another jazz album for eight years. When he did so in 2015, he named his new band Theo Travis' Double Talk after the 2007 album. This new band again included both Outram and Whittaker, with the addition of Nic France on drums. In 1993, Travis worked alongside bassist Dave Sturt on the Jade Warrior album Distant Echoes - as they would again on that band's 2008 album NOW. It was to prove a fortuitous collaboration. The pair worked together in the four-piece jazz fusion band The Other Side, releasing the album Dangerous Days in 1994, and, since 1999, with varying guest musicians in their band Cipher which collaborated with Bill Nelson in both the latter's improvisational three-piece live band Orchestra Futura and his more conventional, seven-piece rock band Bill Nelson and the Gentlemen Rocketeers. Sturt would also serve as Mix engineer on Travis & Fripp's 2014 album Discretion. In 2006, Travis joined Soft Machine Legacy, a project based on personnel and works of the band Soft Machine, replacing the late reedsman Elton Dean. Since 2008 he has worked with guitarist Robert Fripp in the duo Travis and Fripp, releasing four CDs to date, as well as three live concerts as downloads through DGMLive (two of them also on vinyl through Tonefloat). Travis has also worked extensively with Steven Wilson, performing on fifteen of his records and with Wilson mixing six of Travis' releases. Travis appears extensively as featured soloist on Wilson's Grammy nominated album Grace for Drowning and is part of his touring live band. In 2014, using kickstarter funding, he self-published the book Twice Around The World: Steven Wilson Tour Blogs 2012-2013 which included entries previously published on Travis' Facebook page, here re-edited, and was lavishly illustrated with photographs from that tour. In April 2019 it was announced that Travis would be filling in for Bill Rieflin on the King Crimson 50th Anniversary Celebration Tour as keyboardist. However, on 3 May it was announced by Robert Fripp that Travis would no longer be joining the band. Travis has also worked with Harold Budd, Bass Communion, Burnt Friedman, Gong, No-Man, Porcupine Tree, The Tangent, Dave and Richard Sinclair, David Sylvian and David Gilmour. He is of significance to the genres of jazz, ambient music and progressive rock. Awards Travis' album View From the Edge was voted Best British Jazz CD of 1994 by a Jazz on CD Critics/Readers poll.

In the game players can re-enact the four major historical battles in Napoleon's Waterloo campaign (The Battle of Ligny, Battle of Quatre-Bras, Battle of Waterloo and the Battle of Wavre), as well play two hypothetical battles (at Nivelles and Wagnee) which would have possibly taken place had some of the pre-campaign maneuvering been done differently. The battles in the game are fought in real-time, and strive to create a sense of realism. It is based on a series of tabletop games of the same name. References Computer Gaming World in July 1994 rated Fields of Glory three stars out of five. The reviewer praised the in-game database as \\"one of the best orders of battle ever developed for the computer, and almost justifies the game's purchase by itself\\", and the accurate terrain. He criticized the \\"incapable\\" AI, and real- time combat as being too fast at brigade level and too slow at corps level; as the game required both levels to win, he said that the Waterloo battle was too large to manage.

The Franco-Prussian War divided the company's manufacturing capacity, one plant in Niederbronn-les-Bains, Alsace, the other in Lun√©ville, Lorraine. Beginnings In 1896, managing director of the Lun√©ville plant, Baron Adrien de Turckheim, bought the rights to a design by Am√©d√©e Boll√©e. This used a front-mounted horizontal twin engine with sliding clutches and belt drive. It had a folding top, three acetylene headlights, and, very unusual for the period, plate glass windshield. While the company started out using engines from Boll√©e, De Dietrich eventually produced the entire vehicle themselves. 1903, 16 h.p. De Dietrich motor car In 1898, De Dietrich debuted the Torpilleur (Torpedo) racer, which featured a four-cylinder engine and independent suspension in front, for the Paris-Amsterdam Trial; Gaudry wrecked en route, but still placed third. The response was substantial, exceeding one million gold francs. The 1899 torpilleur was less successful, despite underslung chassis, a rear-mounted monobloc four, and twin carburettors; poor preparation left none of the works teams able to complete the Tour de France. The Boll√©e-inspired design was supplanted by a licence-built Belgian Vivinus voiturette at Niederbronn and a Marseilles-designed Turcat-M√©ry at Lun√©ville, following a 1901 deal with that cash-strapped company., in caption In 1902, De Dietrich & Cie hired 21-year-old Ettore Bugatti, who produced prize-winning cars in 1899 and 1901, designing an overhead valve 24 hp (18 kW) four-cylinder with four-speed transmission to replace the Vivinus, colloquially (and retroactively) referred to as the Type 2. There he partnered with Boll√©e, and became acquainted with √âmile Mathis, marketing director.BUGATTI, THE PRESTIGIOUS FRENCH BRAND, September 19, 2019He also created their 30/35 of 1903, with the models today referred to as the Types 3-7 attributed to him before quitting to join Strasbourg-based Mathis in the German Alsace in 1904. The same year, management at Niederbronn quit car production, leaving it entirely to Lun√©ville, with the Alsace market being sold a Turcat-M√©ry badge- engineered as a De Dietrich. Even at the time, this was seen with some disdain, and Lun√©ville put the cross of Lorraine on the grille to distinguish them. Nevertheless, under the skin they were little different, nor would they be until 1911. For all that, the Lorraine-Dietrich was a prestige marque, ranking with Crossley and Itala, while attempting to break into the \\"super- luxury\\" market between 1905 and 1908 with a handful of ¬£4,000 (US$20,000) six- wheeler limousines de voyage. 1905 Lorraine-Dietrich CR2 racing car Like Napiers and Mercedes, Lorraine-Dietrich's reputation was built in part on racing, which was \\"consistent if not distinguished\\", including Charles Jarrott's third in the 1903 Paris‚ÄìMadrid race and a 1-2-3 in the 1906 Circuit des Ardennes, led by ace works driver Arthur Duray. De Dietrich bought out Isotta Fraschini in 1907, producing two OHC cars to Isotta Fraschini designs, including a 10 hp (7.5 kW) allegedly created by Bugatti. Also that year, Lorraine-Dietrich took over Ariel Mors Limited of Birmingham, for the sole British model, a 20 hp (15 kW) four, shown at the Olympia Motor Show in 1908, offered as bare chassis, Salmons & Sons convertible, and Mulliner cabriolet. (The British branch was not a success, lasting only about a year.) A Lorraine- Dietrich 60 HP in Avenida Central (today Avenida Rio Branco), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1908 For 1908, De Dietrich offered a line of chain-driven touring fours, the 18/28 hp, 28/38 hp, 40/45 hp, and 60/80 hp, priced between ¬£550 and ¬£960, and a 70/80 hp six at ¬£1,040. The British version differed, having shaft drive. That year, the names of the automotive and aero-engine divisions were changed to Lorraine-Dietrich. By 1914, all De Dietrichs were shaft-driven, and numbered a 12/16, an 18/20, a new 20/30 tourers, and a sporting four-cylinder 40/75 (in the mold of Mercer or Stutz), all built at Argenteuil, Seine-et-Oise (which became company headquarters postwar). Post-World War I After World War I, with Lorraine restored to France, the company restarted manufacture of automobiles and aero-engines. Their 12-cylinder aero-engines were used by Breguet, IAR, and Aero, among others. In 1919, new technical director Marius Barbarou (late of Delaunay-Belleville) introduced a new model in two wheelbases, the A1-6 and B2-6, joined three years later by the B3-6, with either short or long wheelbase. All fell in the 15 CV fiscal horsepower category, sharing the six cylinder engine, which had overhead valves, hemispherical head, aluminium pistons, and four-bearing crankshaft. The performance was such in 1923, three tourers \\"put up a passable showing\\" at the first 24 Hours of Le Mans, leading to the creation for 1924 of the 15 Sport, with twin carburetion, larger valves, and Dewandre-Reprusseau servo-assisted four-wheel brakes (at a time when four-wheel brakes of any kind were a rarity); they ran second and third, and were comparable to the 3 litre Bentleys. The 15 CV Sport did better in 1925, winning Le Mans, followed home by a sister in third, while in 1926, Bloch and Rossignol won at an average 106 km/h (66 mph), leading a 1-2-3 sweep by Lorraines. Lorraine-Dietrich thus became the first marque to win Le Mans twice and the first to win in two consecutive years. This publicity contributed to touring 15s being bodied by Gaston Grummer, also Argenteuil's director, who produced coachwork for the likes of Aurora, Olympia, Gloriosa, and Chiquita., under \\"Believe it, or not.\\" The 15 CV was joined by the 12 CV, a four-cylinder car (until 1929), and the 30 CV, with a six cylinder engine (until 1927), while the 15 CV survived until 1932; the 15 CV Sport fell in 1930, losing its last race, the 1931 Monte Carlo Rally, when Donald Healey's Invicta edged Jean-Pierre Wimille by a tenth of a point. Name change The De Dietrich family sold its share in the company, which became simply known as Lorraine from 1928 on. End of automobile production The 15 CV was supplanted by the 20 CV, which had a engine, of which just a few hundred were made. Automobile production eventually became unprofitable and, after the failure of their 20 CV model, the concern ceased production of automobiles in 1935. In 1930, De Dietrich was absorbed by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale A√©ronautique, and the Argenteuil plant was converted to making aircraft engines and six-wheel trucks licensed from Tatra. By 1935, Lorraine-Dietrich had disappeared from the automobile industry. Until World War II, Lorraine concentrated on the military market, manufacturing vehicles such as the Lorraine 37L armoured carrier. The Lun√©ville plant returned to rail locomotives. In 2007, it still operated as De Dietrich Ferroviaire.

Huron Shores is a township in the Canadian province of Ontario, located along the North Channel of Lake Huron in the Algoma District. The municipality was created in 1999 through the amalgamation of the former townships of Thessalon, Thompson, and Day and Bright Additional, and the former village of Iron Bridge. The town of Thessalon, although surrounded by Huron Shores, is not part of the township. The township's current mayor is Gil Reeves, who succeeded Ted Linley in the 2010 municipal election.  Communities  The main communities in the township are Iron Bridge, Sowerby and Little Rapids. Smaller communities include Ansonia, Day Mills, Dayton, Dean Lake, Eley, Livingstone, Livingstone Creek, Maple Ridge, Nestorville, Sherwood and Sunset Beach. The municipality officers are located in Iron Bridge, which was originally named Tally-Ho for the call that the lumberjacks would make upon reaching a trading post, Iron Bridge was renamed in the early 1900s after the bridge built over the nearby Mississagi River. Its most notable tourist attractions are its snowmobile trails, nearby wilderness areas for hunting and fishing, and the Voyageur Hiking Trail which passes through the town of Iron Bridge. As a formerly independent village, Iron Bridge retains the status of designated place in Canadian censuses. It had a population of 632 in the Canada 2011 Census, up from 614 in the 2006 census. Recreation The municipality has numerous recreation centres and community halls which are used frequently for local events. These centres are located throughout the municipality and include: * Thessalon Township Community Centre * Little Rapids Gazebo and Ballpark * Sowerby Hall * Historic Cordukes/Weber 12-Sided Barn * Iron Bridge Recreation Centre (Arena) * Thompson Hall Community Gym Many of these community centres have significant historical connections. The Thessalon Township Community Centre is the former Little Rapids one-room school house. The Cordukes/Weber 12-Sided Barn is one of only three 12-sided barns in Canada. It was originally built in 1919 and was restored and relocated to its present site in 2010. Huron Shores is home to two museums. The Iron Bridge Historical Museum and the Heritage Park Museum. The Iron Bridge Historical Museum located in Iron Bridge is dedicated to preserving the heritage of the town and the surrounding communities which make up Huron Shores. The Museum is open seasonally in July and August and consists of a number of historical buildings from the area including two pioneer log houses. The Heritage Park Museum located in Little Rapids, Ontario was established in 1977 to preserve the heritage of the Huron Shores region. The heritage site is open in July and August and is well known locally for its annual county fair and auction which occurs every civic holiday weekend. The Museum is operated by the Thessalon Township Heritage Committee, a committee within the municipality of Huron Shores. There is a substantial farming community in Huron Shores. During the summer months many local farmers and food producers participate in local farmers' markets held at the 12-sided Round Barn heritage site and the Iron Bridge Historical Museum. The municipality is also home to a number of publicly accessible lakes and rivers. The outdoors are one of the main attractions of the area with many visitors coming to the area to fish, hunt, or enjoy the water.

To the west and south, respectively, run the exclusive shopping streets Graben (literally \\"ditch\\") and K√§rntner Stra√üe (\\"K√§rnten\\" is the German for Carinthia). Opposite the Stephansdom is the Haas-Haus, a piece of striking modern architecture by Hans Hollein. Although public opinion was originally skeptical about the combination of the mediaeval cathedral and the glass and steel building, it is now considered an example of how old and new architecture can mix harmoniously . Stock im Eisen Stock-im-Eisen-Platz c. 1895, showing the row of buildings that used to separate Stephansplatz from Stock-im-Eisen-Platz The Stock-im-Eisen (\\"staff in iron\\") is located at the corner of K√§rntner Stra√üe and Graben in a niche on the corner of the Palais Equitable. It is a section of tree trunk into which hundreds of nails have been hammered since the Middle Ages, and which is ringed by an iron band closed by a large padlock. The earliest written mention of it dates to 1533 and it is the subject of legends about the Devil. U-Bahn station The U-Bahn station at Stephansplatz is one of the busiest in the city, and is the only junction between the U1 and U3 underground lines. It is also the nearest U-Bahn station to many of the tourist attractions in the city centre. Virgilkapelle In 1973, during excavation works for the U-Bahn station, a mediaeval chapel was discovered 12 metres under current ground level . It was built around 1250 as a capella subterranea in the Magdalenenkapelle (the outline of which is shown on the pavement of the Stephansplatz). It is possible that it was originally intended as a chapel for burials, but at least by the 14th century had become a crypt for a mercantile family.

It is popular in the physical sciences and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the author‚Äìdate, or \\"Harvard\\", system. Vancouver style is used by MEDLINE and PubMed. Hundreds of scientific journals use author‚Äìnumber systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as punctuation, casing of titles, and italic, vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names \\"Vancouver system\\" or \\"Vancouver style\\" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is Citing Medicine, per the References > Style and Format section of the ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals. These recommendations, the Vancouver Convention and Vancouver guidelines, have a much broader scope than only the citation style: they provide ethical guidelines for writers and rules for co-authorship in scientific collaborations to avoid fraud. The Convention further entails compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and research projects must be recommended by an independent ethics committee.Ettikkom.no Legal statutes and guidelines: the Vancouver recommendations In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author‚Äìnumber system regardless of the formatting details. A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author‚Äìnumber format specified by the ICMJE Recommendations (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM). For example, the AMA reference style is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author‚Äìnumber system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed). History Author‚Äìnumber systems have existed for over a century and throughout that time have been one of the main types of citation style in scientific journals (the other being author‚Äìdate). In 1978, a committee of editors from various medical journals, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), met in Vancouver, BC, Canada to agree to a unified set of requirements for the articles of such journals. This meeting led to the establishment of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (URMs). Part of the URMs is the reference style, for which the ICMJE selected the long-established author‚Äìnumber principle. The URMs were developed 15 years before the World Wide Web debuted. During those years, they were published as articles or supplements in various ICMJE member journals. These included the 1991 BMJ publication, the 1995 CMAJ publication and the 1997 Annals of Internal Medicine publication. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, journals were asked to cite the 1997 JAMA version when reprinting the Uniform requirements. In the early 2000s, with the Web having become a major force in academic life, the idea gradually took hold that the logical home for the latest edition of the URMs would be the ICMJE website itself (as opposed to whichever journal article or supplement had most recently published an update). For example, as of 2004, the editors of Haematologica decided simply to invite their authors to visit www.icmje.org for the 2003 revision of the Uniform requirements. Since the early to mid-2000s, the United States National Library of Medicine (which runs MEDLINE and PubMed) has hosted the ICMJE's \\"Sample References\\" pages. Around 2007, the NLM created Citing Medicine, its style guide for citation style, as a new home for the style's details. The ICMJE Recommendations now point to Citing Medicine as the home for the formatting details of Vancouver style. For example, in the December 2013 edition of the ICMJE Recommendations, the relevant paragraph is IV.A.3.g.ii. (References > Style and Format). Sample usage Labelling citations References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text ‚Äì they are identified by Hindu-Arabic numerals in parentheses (1), square brackets [1], superscript1, or a combination[1]. The number usually appears at the end of the material it supports, and an entry in the reference list would give full bibliographical information for the source: And the entry in the reference list would be: 1\\\\. Placing citations Several descriptions of the Vancouver system say that the number can be placed outside the text punctuation to avoid disruption to the flow of the text, or be placed inside the text punctuation, and that there are different cultures in different traditions. The first method is recommended by some universities and colleges, while the latter method is required by scientific publications such as the MLA and IEEE except for in the end of a block quotation. (IEEE are using Vancouver style labels within brackets, for example [1] to cite the first reference in the list, but otherwise refer to Chicago Style Manual.) The original Vancouver system documents (the ICMJE recommendations and Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) do not discuss placement of the citation mark. Format of citations Different formats exist for different types of sources, e.g. books, journal articles, etc. Format of names Formatting for all names (e.g., authors, editors, etc.) is the same. General Rules for Names: *List names in the order they appear in the text *Enter surname (family or last name) first for each author *Capitalize surnames and enter spaces within surnames as they appear in the document cited on the assumption that the author approved the form used. For example: Van Der Horn or van der Horn; De Wolf or de Wolf or DeWolf. *Convert given (first) names and middle names to initials, for a maximum of two initials following each surname *Give all authors, regardless of the number *Separate author names from each other by a comma and a space *End author information with a period *See exceptions for Author in Appendix F: Notes for Citing MEDLINE¬Æ /PubMed¬Æ. Although Citing Medicine does not explicitly mandate merging initials (e.g. \\"R. K.\\" would be merged into \\"RK\\"), the examples used throughout the book do. Journal articles =Standard journal articles= * Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H1-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy. 2002 Apr;32(4):489-498. * Tashiro J, Yamaguchi S, Ishii T, Suzuki A, Kondo H, Morita Y, Hara K, Koyama I.

Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs ‚Äì the triple whammy. Med J Aust. 2000;172:184-185. The NLM lists all authors for all articles, because it is appropriate for capturing all authors and all of their publications in the MEDLINE database to be found by searches. However, in the reference lists of articles, most journals truncate the list after 3 or 6 names, followed by \\"et al.\\" (which most medical journals do not italicize): * Guilbert TW, Morgan WJ, Zeiger RS, Mauger DT, Boehmer SJ, Szefler SJ, et al.

Optionally, a unique identifier (such as the article's DOI or PMID) may be added to the citation: * von Itzstein M, Wu WY, Kok GB, Pegg MS, Dyason JC, Jin B, et al. Rational design of potent sialidase-based inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Nature. 1993 Jun 3;363(6428):418-423. . NLM elides ending page numbers and uses a hyphen as the range indicating character (184-5). Some journals do likewise, whereas others expand the ending page numbers in full (184-185), use an en dash instead of a hyphen (184‚Äì5), or both (184‚Äì185). Virtually all medical journal articles are published online. Many are published online only, and many others are published online ahead of print. For the date of online publication, at the end of the citation NLM puts \\"[Epub Year Mon Day]\\" (for online-only publication) or \\"[Epub ahead of print]\\" for online ahead of print (with the month and day following the year in its normal position). In contrast, AMA style puts \\"[published online Month Day, Year]\\" at the end of the article title. It no longer uses the term \\"Epub\\" and no longer includes the words \\"ahead of print\\". It omits the year from its normal location after the journal title abbreviation if there is no print data to give (online-only publication). The titles of journals are abbreviated. There are no periods in the abbreviation. A period comes after the abbreviation, delimiting it from the next field. The abbreviations are standardized. The standardization was formerly incomplete and internal to organizations such as NLM. It is now formalized at the supraorganizational level by documents including Citing Medicine at Appendix A: Abbreviations for Commonly Used English Words in Journal Titles, ANSI Z39.5, ISO 4: Information and documentation -- Rules for the abbreviation of title words and titles of publications, and the ISSN.org List of Title Word Abbreviations (LTWA). =Articles not in English= As per journal articles in English: * Forneau E, Bovet D.

It is located in Vienna, Austria, in Stock-im-Eisen-Platz, now part of Stephansplatz, at the corner of the Graben and K√§rntner Stra√üe and is now behind glass on a corner of the Palais Equitable. History The trunk section is tall and is held in place by five iron bands; the iron bears the date 1575Peter Csendes, Historical Dictionary of Vienna, Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow, 1999, , p. 191. and the initials HB, presumably for Hans Buettinger, the house owner who had the iron replaced. The tree was a forked spruce which started to grow around 1400 and was felled in approximately 1440,Felix and Helga Czeike, Wien: Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte der Donaumetropole, Cologne: DuMont, 1999, , p. 99 (German). as was revealed by examination in 1975.P√©ter Csendes and Ferdinand Opll, Wien volume 1: Von den Anf√§ngen bis zur ersten Wiener T√ºrkenbelagerung (1529), Vienna: B√∂hlau, 2001, , p. 93. There was regrowth in the middle of the trunk after blows from an axe. The first nails were inserted while the tree was still alive (thus before 1440). The first written mention of it dates to 1533;Michael Diers, Andreas Beyer, Mo(nu)mente: Formen und Funktionen ephemerer Denkm√§ler, Berlin: Akademie, 1993, , p. 115 (German). in 1548, it was already located on the wall of a house in what became Stock-im-Eisen- Platz. The Palais Equitable, which was built on the site in 1891, incorporates the Stock im Eisen in a niche. It stands on a base made of Czech hornblende granite. Wrought iron vines were added, and the building has Zum Stock-im- Eisen (At the Stock im Eisen) carved above the door and a bronze sculpture group of locksmith apprentices and the tree trunk, by Rudolf Weyr, in the tympanum.Eve Marie Young, Art and Enterprise: The 19th Century Administrative Buildings of a U.S. Life Insurance Company: With Particular Consideration of the Vienna, Austria, building known as \\"zum Stock in Eisen\\", Dissertation, University of Bonn, 1991, pp. 137, 140. In addition, there are a pair of representations of the legend by the same artist on the doors. File:BERMANN(1880) p0852 Der Stock im Eisen.jpg|Illustration from Bermann Alt- und Neu-Wien (1880) File:Stock im Eisen 002.jpg|Another view of the Stock im Eisen today File:Stock im Eisen Relief 001.jpg|One of the reliefs on the door of the Palais Equitable illustrating the legend of the Stock im Eisen File:Stock im Eisen Relief 002.jpg|Second relief illustrating the legend Significance Close-up view of the tree trunk and the nails hammered into it In the 18th century, a custom developed that travelling smiths and apprentices would hammer a nail into the tree trunk; in particular, from 1715 on, travelling journeyman locksmiths.Frances Milton Trollope, Vienna and the Austrians; With Some Account of a Journey through Swabia, Bavaria, the Tyrol, and the Salzbourg, London: Bentley, 1838, OCLC 2431804, p. 276 says that it was to show they were ready to use their \\"good right-hand\\". The reason for doing so before then is unknown; however, it is unlikely to have been a craft guild custom in the beginning, because the Stock im Eisen is significantly older. \\"Nail trees\\" are well known in Southeastern Europe and are found in many cities in Hungary, Romania (in Transylvania) and other countries of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire; the Vienna Stock im Eisen is the oldest preserved nail tree. The custom persisted until the late 19th century,Manfred Wehdorn, Mario Schwarz and Susanne Hayden, Vienna, a Guide to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Vienna: Springer, 2004, , p. 32. and inspired the \\"men of iron\\" statues that were used for propaganda and fund-raising in Germany and Austria in World War I, particularly the tree set up in Freiburg.Roger Chickering, The Great War and Urban Life in Germany: Freiburg, 1914‚Äì1918, Cambridge, 2007, , p. 392, where it is translated \\"Pole of Iron\\". The most likely explanation for the medieval nails is the ancient custom of hammering nails into crosses, trees and even rocks for protection or in gratitude for healing, that is as a votive offering, similar to throwing coins into a wishing well or a pond.Emil Goldmann, Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der germanischen Freilassung durch Wehrhaftmachung, Untersuchungen zur deutschen Staats- und Rechtsgeschichte 70 (1910), p. 25 (German) points out that the legends say that journeymen hammered the nails in on leaving Vienna; that would make it an offering for safe travel. In the Middle Ages, nails were a valuable commodity that people did not waste. The original mythico-religious and legal significance of the Stock im Eisen was effaced in later centuries by an emphasis on crafts. Leopold Schmidt suggested that the tree was originally used as a surveying point defining the \\"mythic centre\\" of the city.Csendes and Opll, p. 73. Legends Many legends surround the Stock im Eisen, mostly dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1703 it was said to be the last remaining tree from the ancient forest;Wiener Geschichtsbl√§tter 1976, p. 40.Gerhard Fischer, Die Stadt und die Wildnis: Wien, 1000-1500, Daedalus, Basel: Stroemfeld/Roter Stern, 1992, , p. 41 the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica says it is the last of a sacred grove around which the city sprang up.Volume 24, p. 220. One legend recounts that the Devil himself put the tree trunk in irons,Mary Mapes Dodge, St. Nicholas Volume 37, Part 1, 1910, p. 401: \\"a tall, dark stranger, hailing from nowhere in particular\\". or at least guards it.Trollope, pp. 276‚Äì77, speaking of three locks. Another tells that a locksmith's apprentice who stole a valuable nail from his master, or wanted to marry his master's daughter, learnt from the Devil how to make an unopenable lock with which to enclose it, and in one version also an identical nail to hammer in beside the stolen one.\\"Der Stock im Eisen\\", from Ludwig Bechstein, Volkssagen, M√§hrchen und Legenden des Kaiserstaates √ñsterreich, 1840, at sagen.at (German), retrieved 24 June 2010.The Eclectic volume 91, 1878, pp. 38‚Äì39.Rasmus Bj√∂rn Anderson, Norse Mythology, Chicago: Griggs, 1884, pp. 403‚Äì07 thinks the stranger was really Loki. However, the details of the legends betray their lack of truth. The padlock which guides to Vienna often refer to as \\"unopenable\\" is only for show, and cannot be opened simply because the insides of the lock are no longer there and so it will not accept a key. Already in 1533 it is referred to as Stock der im Eisen liegt, \\"staff that lies in irons\\". In addition, the well known legend recounts that a thief hammered a stolen nail into the tree as he was fleeing through the forest. Admittedly, the tree was certainly outside the city walls in 1440, but the legend only appeared in the 17th century, when the area was already urban and the Stock im Eisen mounted on the side of a house, and hence is presumably pure invention. The legends of the Devil and the Stock im Eisen are the subject of an 1880 ballet by Pasquale Borri, to music by Franz Doppler.Appleton's Cyclopedia volume 13, pp. 582‚Äì83.John Sullivan Dwight, Dwight's Journal of Music volume 40, no. 1032, November 6, 1880, p. 184. A modern legend holds that the Stock im Eisen is a replica and that the original ‚Äì or at least parts of it ‚Äì is exhibited in the Vienna Museum. This is not true; the tree trunk has neither been divided up nor replicated in recent times. A commentary about this trunk was given in 1856 by Theodore Nielsen, a Danish kleinsmith journeyman in his memoirs.\\"With Staff in Hand:\\" Memories of my wanderings in foreign lands; Aarhus Jutland Publishing, 1903 \\"Outside Stefan church was a place called \\"Stock im Eisen\\" and a boutique in which was a large portrait of a Danish King Frederick VI. The park gets its name from a large tree trunk that stands in one corner with an iron fence around it. The trunk is covered with iron nails so tight from the root up that one could not get room for even a needle between. It is a peculiar sight and this is the legend: Once upon a time there was a castle nearby with a gatelock that was so intricate that even another kleinsmith could not take it apart or unlock it. In the honor of the lock and in his memory every journeyman kleinsmith who found work in Vienna had to hammer a nail into the trunk. It had been there for many a year and was still worth seeing being protected as it is by local pride.\\" References Sources *Alfred Burgerstein. Der 'Stock im Eisen' der Stadt Wien.

Notable events * In the second-round match against the University Football Club, badly concussed Richmond follower Bill Burns, who was about to leave for hospital, heard that Richmond was about to lose the match, returned to the field of play, took a mark, kicked the winning goal, and was carried off the ground on his teammates' shoulders. Later in 1909, Burns was suspended for life after being found guilty of a kicking charge; however, the sentence was later reduced on appeal. * On 19 May 1909, the VFL Permit Committee considered the extraordinary application for a clearance to Carlton by South Melbourne footballer Bill Goddard. Although Goddard had played in all of South Melbourne's pre-season matches, South Melbourne readily agreed to clear him on the grounds that \\"he will not be selected in our team as we do not considered him good enough as a player\\".Migratory Footballers: A Peculiar case, The Argus, (Thursday, 20 May 1909), p.5. The application was made independently by Goddard, and unsolicited by Carlton, because Goddard \\"had seen a couple of the Carlton players who told him that he could get a game\\" and \\"[having seen] one of the committee, had decided to apply for a clearance\\". However, Carlton's secretary, Jack Worrall, informed the Committee that \\"This application has been made without the consent of my committee, and I further wish to state the committee do not desire the services of Mr. Goddard\\". The Permit Committee refused Goddard's application.Victorian League: Permit Business, The Age, (Thursday, 20 May 1909), p.8. **(Goddard transferred to Carlton in 1910, playing 13 senior games with Carlton, before transferring to St Kilda in 1911.) *In Round 6, St Kilda defeated Geelong on the field by one point, but the game was awarded to Geelong on protest after it was established that Billy Stewart, who played for St Kilda in that match, was under suspension for a striking in match in Bendigo the previous week. St Kilda had been aware that Stewart was suspended, but its defence against playing him was procedural: that although Stewart's suspension had been handed down on 3 June, it had not been formally communicated to the VFL until 6 June, one day after the match; but the League found that the suspension was valid for the dates specified by the Bendigo Football Association, and it did not need to have been communicated to the League for it to reciprocally valid. This is the only such forfeiture to have lasted in senior VFL/AFL history (other such forfeits have temporarily occurred in the seniors, but were later reversed on appeal). * In Round 7 against Geelong, Harry Brereton of Melbourne, in only his seventh game, became the first player to kick nine or more goals in a match since Jim McShane in 1899. * A Round 8 match between Fitzroy and Melbourne was marred by numerous incidents of foul play. Spectators were involved in a large brawl at the end of the game. * The Round 13 match between Carlton and Geelong saw the teams score an aggregate of 29.26 (200), the highest in VFL history to that time. * There were riots in the crowd after the Round 13 match between South Melbourne and Fitzroy. * An imminent on-field brawl between players from Collingwood and South Melbourne in their Round 14 match was averted when the appearance of a policeman on the ground calmed both teams down. * The Round 15 match between St Kilda and Geelong is the last VFL/AFL game as of 2017 in which no goals were scored in the second half. On a flooded Junction Oval, St Kilda kicked 0.7 to Geelong's 0.5 after half time. *University's draw with Collingwood in Round 16 was the closest that the Students got to defeating the Magpies in a League match. * A Collingwood spectator jumped the fence at the Round 18 match against Melbourne and punched a Melbourne player. Melbourne's Secretary, Mr. J.A. Harper, ran onto the field and made a citizens' arrest. * The Argus newspaper published the height, weight and occupation of each player in the finals for the first time.

He was taken from the county jail by a group of armed men, after a confrontation with the sheriff, and taken to an isolated area where he was lynched. This incident contributed to fears in the black community about treatment by police and whites if any of their members were arrested. Background Nida, hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the stomach, had identified Belton as the person who robbed and shot him. Belton confessed after being arrested, but told police the shooting was an accident. Rumors began to spread of mob justice if Nida died. While Nida was hospitalized, local newspaper the Tulsa Tribune published Belton's photo and said that he \\"planned to escape on a plea of insanity\\".Hirsch, James S. Riot and Remembrance: The Tulsa Race War and Its Legacy. 2002. Houghton Mifflin Company. Nida died a week after being shot, and his wife was quoted as saying \\"I hope that justice will be done for they have taken an innocent life and ruined my happiness. They deserve to be mobbed but the other way is better\\". That night a crowd gathered at the Tulsa County Court House, where the county jail was located on the top floor. Several armed men entered the building, where they confronted Sheriff James Wooley and ordered him to release Belton. They took Belton outside and drove him in his victim's taxi to a lonely road near Jenks, about nine miles outside Tulsa, and lynched him. At the scene, local police kept onlookers away from Belton and his captors and directed traffic. Walter F. White, \\"The Eruption of Tulsa\\", The Nation, 29 June 1921; reprinted 20 August 2001 Aftermath Governor James Robertson condemned the lynching and tried to remove Sheriff Wooley from his elected position. An all- white grand jury investigated, but indicted no one. Police Chief John Gustafson stated his disapproval of mob rule, but also warned that the public in Tulsa was not prejudiced against such an action. Both the Tulsa Tribune and the Tulsa World, capitalizing on sensationalism, published editorials that spoke approvingly of the mob action. A. J. Smitherman, editor of the black- owned newspaper, Tulsa Star, realized that, if a mob could lynch a white man, no black man would be safe if he were jailed. Later, he warned that blacks should take matters into their own hands if another black were arrested. The next year young black man Dick Rowland was arrested on a complaint from a white woman although she did not press charges. The Tulsa Tribune published inflammatory material about the incident. Aware of the failure of Tulsa police to defend the white Belton against a lynch mob, some in the black community offered to help the sheriff's deputies defend Rowland when a crowd gathered outside the courthouse. The Sheriff said they did not need assistance. Hours later an armed confrontation took place outside the courthouse, and the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 broke out. Mobs of whites attacked the black community of Greenwood, injuring and killing hundreds of people, and burning tens of blocks to the ground, in the most destructive race riot in United States history.Scott Ellsworth, \\"Tulsa Race Riot\\", The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, 2009; accessed 31 December 2016 See also *Mass racial violence in the United States References Category:Year of birth missing Category:1920 deaths Category:American murder victims Category:1920 in the United States Category:History of Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:People murdered in Oklahoma Category:Lynching deaths in Oklahoma ","title":"Roy Belton"},{"id":"7217973","text":"Tomaso Antonio Vitali (March 7, 1663 - May 9, 1745) was an Italian composer and violinist from Bologna, the eldest son of Giovanni Battista Vitali.Suess 2001. He is known mainly for a chaconne in G minor for violin and continuo, which was published from a manuscript in the S√§chsische Landesbibliothek in Dresden in Die Hoch Schule des Violinspiels (1867) edited by German violinist Ferdinand David.[ Chaconne for violin & continuo in G minor], as reviewed by Michael Jameson on Allmusic That work's wide-ranging modulations into distant keys have raised speculation that it could not be a genuine baroque work. Biography Vitali studied composition in Modena with Antonio Maria Pacchioni, and was employed at the Este court orchestra from 1675 to 1742. He was a teacher, whose pupils included Evaristo Felice dall'Abaco, Jean Baptiste Senaill√©, Girolamo Nicol√≤ Laurenti and Luca Antonio Predieri. Authentic works by Vitali include a set of trio sonatas published as his opus numbers 1 and 2 (1693), sonatas da camera (chamber sonatas), and violin sonatas (including his opus 6) among other works. Among those that have been recorded include all of the op. 1 (on Naxos 8.570182), three of the violin sonatas (on the Swiss label Gallo), and some of the sonatas from the opp. 2 and 4 sets (opus 4, no. 12 on Classica CL 101 from Finland.) He died at Modena. The chaconne A chaconne is a musical form used as a vehicle for variation on a repeated short harmonic progression over a ground bass. The Chaconne was marked by the copyist, at the time of transcription, in the upper margin of the first page of the Dresden manuscript as \\"Parte del Tomaso Vitalino\\" (Tomaso Vitalino's part),Reich 1970, 40, who may or may not be Vitali.Andrew Manze. \\"Angels & devils of the violin\\" One striking feature of the \\"Vitali\\" Chaconne's style is the way it wildly changes key, reaching the far-flung territories of B-flat minor and E-flat minor, modulations uncharacteristic of the Baroque era, as change of key signature became typical only in Romanticism. The manuscript, S√§chsische Landesbibliothek Dresden, Mus. 2037/R/1, has more recently been identified as being in the hand of Jacob Lindner, a known copyist who was working at the Dresden Hofkapelle between 1710 and 1730, which lends credit to its authenticity.Reich 1970, 39; \\"Baroque Virtuoso\\" Despite musicological doubts, the piece has been ever popular amongst violinists. For example, Jascha Heifetz chose it, in a \\"very much arranged and altered version\\", with organ accompaniment, to open his New York debut in Queen's Hall on 5 May 1920.Anon. 1920. \\"A New Violinist: Jascha Heifetz at Queen's Hall\\". The New York Times (Thursday, 6 May): p. 14. Arrangements of it exist for violin and piano by Ferdinand David and by L√©opold Charlier, for violin and organ, for violin and orchestra by Ottorino Respighi, and there are transcriptions of it for viola and piano by Friedrich Hermann (1828-1907) and by Alan Arnold (contemporary American violist and music publisher, owner of \\"Viola World Publications\\") and for cello and piano by Luigi Silva.

He is best known for being a member of the band 10cc since 1976. He has also collaborated with Mike Oldfield, Rick Wakeman, Hollies singer Peter Howarth and Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. History Rick Fenn attended the Dragon School and Magdalen College School in Oxford. Fenn‚Äôs musical career started in Oxford where he was leader of the school band 'Bagshot Louie'. The band folded with the end of the school year in 1971 and Fenn moved to Cambridge, to attend the Cambridge College of Arts and Technology. After completing an HND business studies course, Fenn joined a Cambridge band called Hamilton Gray who moved to Manchester and became the band 'Gentlemen'. Their debut TV appearance on a show called 'So It Goes' (along with the Sex Pistols) resulted in a liaison with Paul Burgess who soon after, recommended him to 10CC which he joined towards the end of 1976 at the launch of the Deceptive Bends album and has been part of the team ever since. From 1979 he also toured and recorded with Mike Oldfield and with him co-wrote the song ‚ÄúFamily Man‚Äù which went on to become a big hit for Hall & Oates all over the world and win him an A.S.C.A.P. award for best song in 1984. In 1985, Fenn wrote and recorded his own album Profiles with the Pink Floyd‚Äôs drummer Nick Mason. The single from the album, \\"Lie for a Lie\\" sung by David Gilmour and featuring Maggie Reilly was a hit in the United States. Also in the 1980s Fenn and Mason formed Bamboo Music, a company that produced music jingles for corporate clients. Over the years, Fenn has toured with artists such as Rick Wakeman, Jack Bruce, Elkie Brooks and Wax (with Andrew Gold and Graham Gouldman). As a guitarist, he has recorded with numerous artists among them Cliff Richard, Peter Green, Agnetha F√§ltskog (ABBA), Marilyn, Sniff 'n' the Tears, John Wetton and Justin Hayward. From the late 1980s, Fenn devoted more of his time to composing and wrote countless scores for television documentaries, dramas and comedies (including series for Hale and Pace and Craig Charles) and a number of feature films. Amongst those were White of the Eye which was another collaboration with Nick Mason. Over the years he has won several awards for high-profile commercial sound tracks. One soundtrack that won Fenn a Gold Clio award in America in 1989 for best song, featured Peter Howarth on vocals. He went on to form a writing partnership with Howarth, now the lead singer with the Hollies, and in 1990 they wrote a rock opera called \\"Robin, Prince of Sherwood\\" which toured the UK for a year and spent four months in the West End. Fenn and Howarth have other projects in the pipeline. They also periodically assemble a troupe of prominent musicians and perform as the Feramones. Fenn recently toured throughout Germany as part of the Nokia Night of the Proms Band where, as well as 10cc, he played with Tears For Fears, Robin Gibb and Kim Wilde. When not working with 10CC, Fenn now spends most of his time at his home near Byron Bay, New SOuth Wales, in Australia, with his wife and daughter Heather and Ruby-Mae where he has also collaborated with Australian rock legend Brian Cadd on various projects including a stage musical.

He was a multi-time Amateur Athletic Association of England champion, and won two gold medals at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. Career Larner was a Brighton policeman, and took up athletics at the age of 28 in 1903. In 1904 he won the Amateur Athletic Association of England (AAA) titles for the two and seven-mile track walk. He went on to retain these titles in the following year. He wanted to retire as he found training conflicted with his job, but was instead granted an extended leave period by the Police Force. In 1906, he took a two-year break from athletics to train for the upcoming 1908 Summer Olympics held in London. After returning, he was disqualified in his first race in April 1908, at the AAA event in walking over seven miles, but the following July he won the two-mile title. He competed for Great Britain in the 1908 Summer Games in the 3500 metre walk on 14 July 1908, winning the race ahead of fellow Briton Ernest Webb, who took silver, and New Zealander Harry Kerr. Webb had initially taken the lead, but Larner caught up during the second lap and went on to win the race by over twelve seconds. Afterwards he matched this with another gold medal in the 10-mile walk, this time in a British clean sweep, with Webb again winning silver and Edward Spencer winning bronze. Both he and Webb were inside the world record time, with Larner setting world records for both the 9-mile and the 10-mile distances. His final time was 1 hour, 15 minutes and 57.4 seconds. He was one of ten competitors to win more than a single gold medal at the 1908 Games. In 1909 he wrote a book on walking entitled Larner's Text Book on Walking: Exercise, Pleasure, Sport. His final AAA success came in 1911, when he won the 7 mile race once more. Legacy Larner broke the world record in walking in all distances between two miles and ten miles, and the longest distance in one hour, which he set at . The record he set for the 2-mile on 14 July 1904 stood for the following 39 years. The 1908 Summer Games was the only time that either the men's 10-mile walk or the 3500 metre walk took place. This technically means that Larner remains the reigning Olympic champion in both events, and the Olympic record holder. He is one of only a handful of British athletes to have won more than a single gold medal at any one Olympic Games, with only Charlotte Cooper having achieved it at an earlier Olympics, and Henry Taylor winning three medals at the 1908 Games. Larner's name has been carried on the front of a Scania Omnidekka bus in the fleet of Brighton & Hove since October 2007.

Today it is regarded as one of the prime examples of Socialist Classicism architecture in Southeastern Europe, as well as one of the main landmarks of Sofia. The yellow-cobblestoned square around which the ensemble is centred is called Nezavisimost (Independence) Square. Independence Square is formed by the Knyaz Aleksandar Dondukov Boulevard and Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard merging from the east to continue as Todor Aleksandrov Boulevard west of the Largo. The ensemble consists of the former Party House (former headquarters of the defunct Bulgarian Communist Party), now used as administrative offices by the National Assembly of Bulgaria, in the centre, and two side edifices: one today accommodating the TZUM department store and the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria and another that is today occupied by the President's Office, the Sofia Hotel Balkan and the Ministry of Education. History A Council of Ministers of Bulgaria decree was published in 1951 regarding the construction of the Largo. The lot in the centre of the city, damaged by the bombing of Sofia in World War II, was cleared in the autumn of 1952, so that the construction of the new buildings could begin in the following years. The Party House building, once crowned by a red star on a pole, was designed by a team under architect Petso Zlatev and completed in 1955. The Ministry of Electrification office, later occupied by the State Council and today by the President's Office, the work of Petso Zlatev, Petar Zagorski and other architects, was finished the following year, while the TZUM part of the edifice, designed by a team under Kosta Nikolov, followed in 1957. The fountain between the President's Office and the older National Archaeological Museum, was shaped in 1958. The Largo also once featured a statue of Vladimir Lenin, which was later removed and replaced by the one of St. Sophia in 2000. Refurbishment Transparent cover over the ruins of ancient Serdica Following the democratic changes after 1989, the symbols of communism in the decoration of the Largo were removed, with the most symbolic act being the removing of the red star on a pole atop the former Party House using a helicopter and its substitution by the flag of Bulgaria. In the 1990s there have been suggestions to reshape the former Party House, sometimes regarded as an imposing remnant of a past ideology, by introducing more modern architectural elements. According to the new architectural plan of Sofia, Independence Square is being reorganized. The lawn and the flags in the centre are replaced by glass domes, so that the ruins of the ancient Thracian and Roman city of Serdica can be exposed in an impressive way, thus becoming a tourist attraction. The two underpasses, the one in front of the former Party House and the one with the medieval Church of St Petka, are also connected to ease the access to the nearby metro stations.

The aim was to construct a light and cheap weapon that would bridge the gap between the hand-held musket and the heavy stationary cannon. The varnished leather from which the gun got its name acted merely as the outer protective surface of the piece. The first working examples were built by Swiss and Austrian engineers. The first attempts to use them in combat were made by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, during the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War (1626‚Äì1629), but were largely unsuccessful.Brzezinski (1993), p. 17‚Äì20 They were used extensively during the English Civil Wars in the 1640s and 1650s, especially in Scotland. Background Cannon in the early 17th century were of a plethora of calibers. In order to simplify logistics Gustavus Adolphus reduced the number of calibers to guns firing 24-, 12- and 6-pound cannonballs (roughly 10, 5 & 2.5 kg) . Guns made from cast iron were too heavy to be moved during battle, and were used only in fortresses or aboard ships. Guns used in the field were limited to bronze cannon, but only the very lightest pieces could be moved during battle especially if the terrain was uneven. Gustavus Adolphus' tactics were based on use of effective firepower. While heavy cannon were effective at the start of the battle, they could not be moved from the hill that they usually were deployed on (the guns themselves weighed from roughly 300 kilograms (660 pounds) to 3 tons). As such, the artillery could not respond effectively to developments in battle. Leather cannon To fill the gap, the so-called leather cannon was developed. A relatively thin copper tube was reinforced by heavy cords and finally clad in leather (alternatively clad in leather straps first and then rope cords). While the weapon was light enough to be mobile (it required only a two-man crew to pull into position and operate), and at the same time was cheaper in construction, the basic design proved to be flawed. The reinforcing materials acted as an insulator, and did not allow heat to dissipate fast enough. After only a few shots the gun would be too hot to use. The heat would also deform the tube and drastically decrease accuracy. Once damaged thusly, even after being allowed to cool, the barrel was prone to bursting, severely injuring the loader. As a field weapon it was too unreliable to be viable. The weapon had achieved one important success ‚Äì it demonstrated the usefulness of mobile fire support. Before Sweden's entry in the Thirty Years' War, a new weapon had been developed, the bronze 3-pounder regimental cannon. This could be towed by a single horse or three men and had a rate of fire 50% faster than the muskets of the period. Use in Scotland and Korea A pair of Leather cannon in the West Highland Museum While short-lived, the leather cannon was copied by numerous nations of Europe, most notably Scotland. In Korea, during the Joseon Dynasty, leather guns make their appearance in government records from at least 1649. They were hailed for their lightness, and therefore, superior manoeuvrability. The only difference between the Korean leather cannon and that of Europe was that the Korean counterpart was covered in thick Korean paper heavily saturated with grease. For several decades after its adoption, hundreds of leather cannon were produced, indicating their popularity. Similar to its European counterpart, it also fired iron shot weighing about 4 pounds. Survivors Very few original leather cannon have survived to modern times. There is one in the Palace Armoury museum in Valletta, Malta.Page 26 See also *Battalion gun *Wooden cannon *Grasshopper cannon References Bibliography  Brzezinski, Richard, The Army of Gustavus Adolphus: (2) Cavalry, Oxford: Osprey, 1993, especially pp. 17‚Äì20. * Lappalainen, Jussi T., Sadan vuoden sotatie, Suomen sotilaat 1617-1721, Jyv√§skyl√§: Gummerus 2001 Category:Infantry guns Category:Artillery of Sweden Category:Cannon ","title":"Leather cannon"},{"id":"7218098","text":"Ernest James \\"Ernie\\" Webb (25 April 1874 ‚Äì 24 February 1937) was a British athlete who competed mainly in the 10 mile walk.

The next year saw him step up to the very upper echelon of javelin throwers with his new personal best (and national record) of 86.33 meters, thrown in Helsinki on 16 July 1963. This was very close to the world record at the time (86.74 m). In the Olympic year 1964 however, Nevala had major problems even breaking 80 meters and did not enter the Tokyo Olympics as a favorite. He cleared the Olympic qualification quite easily while the world record holder, Terje Pedersen of Norway, was knocked out ‚Äì the first man not to qualify. In the final Nevala threw confidently from the start, and took the lead with his fourth throw of 82.66 m, his best that year. This was eventually enough for a victory, narrowly ahead of Gergely Kulcs√°r. After the Olympics Nevala's career stagnated. He finished fourth at the 1966 European Athletics Championships at Budapest. His attempt to defend his Olympic title at the 1968 Summer Olympics was cut short in the qualification as his longest throw was controversially declared flat and he failed to advance to the final. In 1969 Nevala's career had a major resurgence, as he finally broke his six-year-old personal best multiple times, culminating in a 91.40 m throw in his home town of Teuva. At the 1969 European Championships Nevala took the silver medal behind JƒÅnis L≈´sis of the Soviet Union. Nevala has later openly attributed this resurgence to anabolic steroids, which were not yet forbidden at the time. In 1970, Nevala was arguably the best javelin thrower in the world winning 50 out of his 55 competitions. He threw over 90 meters in 5 competitions, over 85 meters in 32 competitions and over 80 meters in 52 competitions. His top 10 average of the season was 90.12 m and all- season average 85.86 m. Nevala's personal best of 92.64 m in Helsinki on 6 September 1970 landed only 6 cm short of Jorma Kinnunen‚Äôs world record. In addition to the world's best performance of the year, Nevala was ranked number one javelin thrower by Track & Field News. Nevala and Kinnunen intentionally fouled all their qualification throws at the 1970 Finnish Championships as a protest against the Finnish Amateur Athletic Association. The protest eventually led to an improved stipend system. Nevala's career suddenly ended in April 1971 when, in his very first competition of the year at Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire, he injured his shoulder so badly he could never throw seriously again.

He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo and Emmaus Bible College. He earned a Master of Philosophy degree in philosophical theology in 1995 at the Institute for Christian Studies where he studied under James Olthuis. He went on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1999 from Villanova University where he was advised by John D. Caputo. After teaching for a short time at Loyola Marymount University, Smith accepted his current position at Calvin University. He currently resides in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is a Senior Fellow at the Trinity Forum. Work His work is undertaken at the borderlands between philosophy, theology, ethics, aesthetics, science, and politics. Drawing from continental philosophy and informed by a long Augustinian tradition of theological cultural critique ‚Äì from Augustine of Hippo and John Calvin to Jonathan Edwards and Abraham Kuyper ‚Äì his interests are in bringing critical thought to bear on the practices of the church and the church's witness to culture, culminating in the need to interpret and understand what he has called \\"cultural liturgies\\". As a former proponent of radical orthodoxy, Smith's claim is that it is actually theology or, more specifically, the story told by the church that is capable of countering modernism. His popular-level work largely aims at educating evangelicals regarding postmodernism and radical orthodoxy. Though he is critical of the emergent church movement, it should be said that he is at the same time sympathetic to much that could be described as part of that movement. It seems that a primary concern in his work is to expose certain postmodern philosophical claims (and certain ecclesial attempts to work with them) as not actually postmodern enough, pointing out instead that they too have accepted the agenda set by the enlightenment. This is seen in his warnings that the emergent tendency away from historic ecclesial tradition is a grave mistake, and that putting down roots, committing to a community for the long haul, and engaging the deep discourses within historic Christian orthodoxy are in fact the truly post- or counter-modern practices for the church today. Given his training in continental philosophy and in the theology of the Reformed and Pentecostal traditions, his intellectual interests are a natural fit. Smith's research topics range from the continental philosophy of religion to urban altruism to the relationship between science and theology.

Their common name comes from a distinctive defensive behavior in which the shark curls into a circle and covers its eyes with its tail. The genus is endemic to southern Africa, inhabiting shallow coastal waters. All four species are small, stout-bodied sharks with broad, flattened heads and rounded snouts. They are characterized by very large nostrils with enlarged, triangular flaps of skin that reach the mouth, and deep grooves between the nostrils and the mouth. Shysharks are bottom-dwelling predators of bony fishes and invertebrates. They are oviparous, with the females laying egg capsules. These harmless sharks are of no commercial or recreational interest, though their highly limited distributions in heavily fished South African waters are of potential conservation concern. Taxonomy and phylogeny The genus Haploblepharus was created by American zoologist Samuel Garman in 1913, in the 36th volume of Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, at Harvard College, to contain the puffadder shyshark, then known as Squalus edwardsii. The name is derived from the Greek hapl√≥os meaning \\"single\\", and blepharos meaning \\"eyelid\\".Bester, C. Biological Profiles: Puffadder Shyshark. Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on August 31, 2009. In 1988, Leonard Compagno placed Haploblepharus with Halaelurus and Holohalaelurus in the tribe Halaelurini of the family Scyliorhinidae, based on morphological characters. This interpretation was corroborated by a 2006 phylogenetic analysis based on three mitochondrial DNA genes. However, that study also found that within this group Haploblepharus is most closely related to the genus Halaelurus, which is inconsistent with the presence of three autapomorphic traits in Haploblepharus that are not shared by either Halaelurus or Holohalaelurus. Within the genus, the puffadder shyshark is the most basal species. Species * Haploblepharus edwardsii (Schinz, 1822) (Puffadder shyshark) * Haploblepharus fuscus J. L. B. Smith, 1950 (Brown shyshark) * Haploblepharus kistnasamyi Human & Compagno, 2006 (Natal shyshark) * Haploblepharus pictus (J. P. M√ºller & Henle, 1838) (Dark shyshark) Distribution and habitat All four shyshark species are endemic to the southern tip of Africa; three of them are found only off South Africa, while the range of the dark shyshark extends to southern Namibia. They are bottom- dwelling in nature and usually found in shallow, coastal waters over sandy or rocky bottoms. Description The broad, flattened head of a dark shyshark. Different shyshark species are very similar to one another in appearance but can be reliably differentiated using morphological measurements. However, in the field the only way to readily tell them apart is by their different color patterns, and even this may be problematic as individuals of the same species can vary considerably in coloration. All four species are small, seldom exceeding in length. A shyshark has a stout, spindle-shaped body and a short head comprising less than one-fifth of the total length. The head is broad and dorsally flattened, with a rounded snout. The large, oval eyes have cat-like slit pupils, a rudimentary nictitating membrane (protective third eyelid), and a prominent ridge running underneath. A distinguishing trait of this genus are the large nostrils partially covered by greatly expanded, triangular flaps of skin that overlap the mouth and cover a pair of deep grooves between the nasal excurrent (outflow) openings and the mouth. The mouth is short and curved, with furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws. The teeth have a central cusp and smaller lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are located on the upper side of the body. The two dorsal fins are set far back on the body, the first originating behind the pelvic fin midbases and the second originating behind the anal fin midbase. The pectoral fins are moderately large; the dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins are of similar size. The broad caudal fin comprises a fifth of the total length; the upper lobe has a deep ventral notch near the tip and the lower lobe is virtually absent. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified, leaf-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration is brown above and white below; the brown shyshark is usually plain while the other species have varying patterns of darker \\"saddles\\" and white spots. Biology and ecology The egg case of a puffadder shyshark Shysharks feed on a variety of small benthic bony fishes and invertebrates. In turn, they are preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, these sharks adopt a curious posture in which they curl their bodies into a ring and cover their eyes with their tails, which is the origin of the name \\"shyshark\\". This behavior likely serves to make the shark more difficult for a predator to swallow. Shysharks are oviparous with females producing egg capsules (known as \\"mermaid's purses\\") two at a time. Reproduction has been investigated in the puffadder and dark shysharks; neither species appears to have a distinct breeding season, and their eggs take around three and a half weeks to hatch.Dainty, A.M. (2002). Biology and ecology of four catshark species in the southwestern Cape, South Africa. M.Sc. thesis, University of Cape Town. Human interactions Due to their small size, shysharks pose no danger to humans and are not sought by either commercial or recreational fishers. They are taken as bycatch and hooked by shore anglers, who regard them (and other catsharks) as minor pests. Although shysharks are not uncommon, their extremely limited distribution within heavily fished waters raises concerns that a local increase in fishing pressure or habitat degradation could affect entire species populations. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed two shyshark species as Near Threatened.

She made 315 Pacific crossings. In 1891, Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and the British government reached agreement on a contract for subsidized mail service between Britain and Hong Kong via Canada; and the route began to be serviced by three specially designed ocean liners. Each of these three vessels was given an Imperial name.Miller, William H. (1984). The First Great Ocean Liners in Photographs, p. 52.

History Empress of Japan enters Vancouver Harbour in 1893. Empress of Japan was built by Naval Construction & Armaments Co. (now absorbed into Vickers Armstrongs) at Barrow-in-Furness, England. The 5,905-ton vessel had a length of , and her beam was . The white-painted, clipper-bowed ship had two buff-colored funnels with a band of black paint at the top, three lightweight schooner-type masts, and an average speed of 16-knots. Empress of Japan and her two sister-ships were the first vessels in the Pacific to have twin propellers with reciprocating engines.Tate, E. Mowbray. (1986). Transpacific Steam: The Story of Steam Navigation from the Pacific Coast of North America to the Far East and the Antipodes, 1867‚Äì1941, p. 145. The ship was designed to provide accommodation for 770 passengers (120 first class, 50 second class and 600 steerage). She was launched on 13 December 1890 by Lady Alice Stanley, daughter-in-law of Lord Stanley, who was then the Governor-General of Canada.Musk, George. (1981). Canadian Pacific: The Story of the Famous Shipping Line, p. 63. The ship left Liverpool on 11 April 1891 on her maiden voyage via Suez to Hong Kong and Vancouver, arriving in British Columbia on 2 June. Thereafter, she regularly sailed the route between Canada and the east coast of Asia. In the early days of wireless telegraphy, the call sign established for the Empress of Japan was \\"MPJ.\\"Trevent, Edward.

This vessel was part of a fleet of Empress ships, but somehow Empress of Japan stood out, in part because she held the speed record for crossing the Pacific for over two decades. Captained by Captain Henry Pybus, Empress of Japan won blue ribbon for record crossing of the Trans-Pacific crossing of 1897. The proud ship remained in active trans- Pacific service until 1922; and then she lingered, harbor-bound in Vancouver for several years. The dragon figurehead has been preserved at the Seawall in Stanley Park World War I Empress of Japan was refitted as an Armed merchantman during the Great War; and consequently, she lost the elegant white gleam associated with luxury cruise ships. The agreement of commission between Canadian Pacific Railway, the Canadian Federal Government and the British Parliament included a clause which stated that in the event of war, Empress of Japan would be re-fitted to meet Admiralty requirements. In 1914, two days before Empress of Japan arrived in Yokohama on a routine trip to Asia, World War I broke out in Europe. His Majesty's Admiralty acted swiftly to take advantage of the wartime commissioning clause, and Empress of Japan was re- fitted.Kirsten Weisenburger, Kirsten and Marc Dinsdale. \\"First Class Warrior Empress,\\" Pacific Rim Online Magazine (Vancouver, British Columbia). 1998. During the war years, SS Empress of Japan was also refitted as an Armed Auxiliary Cruiser. After the Armistice, this ship was the only one of the first three Empress ocean liners to return to the trans-Pacific route.Tate, p. 145. In 1923, the war-weary ship was used in a different kind of battle when Canadian Pacific used the aging Empress of Japan to house strikebreakers in a dispute with the Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association.Phillips, Paul A. (1967). No Power Greater: A Century of Labour in British Columbia, p. 93. The ship remained moored in Vancouver's harbor until 1926. The CP eventually replaced the Empress with a new vessel, which was also called Empress of Japan. Salvage Replica of Empress of Japan figurehead in Vancouver's Stanley Park. The figurehead was rescued after being discarded during the salvage of Empress of Japan by the Vancouver Daily Province newspaper. It was restored and in 1927 was mounted for public display in Vancouver's Stanley Park. That figurehead was itself replaced in 1960 with a fiberglass replica, as the original was beginning to deteriorate. The original figurehead has been once again restored and is now housed at the Vancouver Maritime Museum as part of its permanent collection. Various portions of the ship's once lavish interior were also scavenged by local homeowners from Vancouver's wealthiest neighbourhoods and added to their homes and property values.

King Henry III granted Adam de Basing \\"certain houses in Aldermanbury and in Milk-street; the advowson of the church at Bassings hall; with other liberties and privileges\\". John Leake's 1667 map of the City of London refers to the ward as \\"Basinghall ward\\". Guilds and churches Cole's 1755 map of Bassishaw ward. Located in this ward was a weekly cloth market, authorised by King Richard III. The coopers' guild hall was first founded in this ward in 1522, at The Swan, a public house, and, from 1547, a purpose-built hall accommodated the coopers. Their hall was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 but later rebuilt on the same site. They rebuilt again in 1865, selling a part of the site to the City of London Corporation for the expansion of the Guildhall. This hall was destroyed by fire on the night of 29 December 1940.History of the Coopers (Company of Coopers) accessed 21 May 2007 The masons' hall was constructed in 1463 in Mason's Avenue, a street which today forms part of the ward's southern boundary. Their hall was also sold to the Corporation in 1865. The weavers and girdlers also had their guild halls in the ward. The modern livery halls of the pewterers, salters and brewers are also located in Bassishaw. There were two churches in this small ward, neither of which remain standing. St Michael Bassishaw, dedicated to St Michael, the archangel, which was founded in the 12th century.Churches of the City of London Reynolds,H (Bodley Head 1922) At that time, the rectorship was included in the gift of St Bartholomew-the- Great, but, over time, it came to be associated with St Paul's Cathedral itself. The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and rebuilt in 1679. It was united with St Lawrence Jewry in 1897; the site was sold in 1899 and the church was demolished in 1900.

It is the sole species of Pontederia subg. Oshunae. Description Water hyacinth is a free-floating perennial aquatic plant (or hydrophyte) native to tropical and sub-tropical South America. With broad, thick, glossy, ovate leaves, water hyacinth may rise above the surface of the water as much as in height. The leaves are across on a stem which is floating by means of buoyant bulb-like nodules at its base above the water surface. They have long, spongy and bulbous stalks. The feathery, freely hanging roots are purple-black. An erect stalk supports a single spike of 8‚Äì15 conspicuously attractive flowers, mostly lavender to pink in colour with six petals. When not in bloom, water hyacinth may be mistaken for frog's-bit (Limnobium spongia) or Amazon frogbit (Limnobium laevigatum). One of the fastest-growing plants known, water hyacinth reproduces primarily by way of runners or stolons, which eventually form daughter plants. Each plant additionally can produce thousands of seeds each year, and these seeds can remain viable for more than 28 years. Some water hyacinths were found to grow between a day in some sites in Southeast Asia. The common water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) are vigorous growers and mats can double in size in one to two weeks. And in terms of plant count rather than size, they are said to multiply by more than a hundredfold in number, in a matter of 23 days. In their native range, these flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bees and they can reproduce both sexually and clonally. The invasiveness of the hyacinth is related to its ability to clone itself and large patches are likely to all be part of the same genetic form. Water hyacinth has three flower morphs and is termed \\"tristylous\\". The flower morphs are named for the length of their pistil: long, medium and short. Tristylous populations are however limited to the native lowland South America range of water hyacinth; in the introduced range, the M-morph prevails, with the L-morph occurring occasionally and the S-morph is absent altogether.Barrett, Spencer C.H. (1977) Tristyly in Eichhornia crassipes (Water Hyacinth). Biotropica, 9: 230‚Äì238 This geographical distribution of the floral morphs indicates that founder events have played a prominent role in the species' worldwide spread.Barrett, Spencer C.H. (1989) Waterweed invasions. Scientific American, 260: 90‚Äì97. Habitat and ecology Its habitat ranges from tropical desert to subtropical or warm temperate desert to rainforest zones. The temperature tolerance of the water hyacinth is the following; its minimum growth temperature is ; its optimum growth temperature is ; its maximum growth temperature is , and its pH tolerance is estimated at 5.0‚Äì7.5. Leaves are killed by frost and plants do not tolerate water temperatures > . Water hyacinths do not grow where the average salinity is greater than 15% that of sea water (around 5 g salt per kg). In brackish water, its leaves show epinasty and chlorosis, and eventually die. Rafts of harvested water hyacinth have been floated to the sea where it is killed. Azotobacter chroococcum, a nitrogen-fixing bacteria, is probably concentrated around the bases of the petioles. But the bacteria do not fix nitrogen unless the plant is suffering extreme nitrogen-deficiency. apud . Fresh plants contain prickly crystals.

Uses  Since the water hyacinths are so prolific, harvesting them for industrial use serves also as a means of environmental control. In north-east India, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam the water hyacinth's stems are used as a braiding material and a source of fibers. Strings of dried fibers are woven or interlinked together to form a braid or cord used for making bags, footwear, wreaths, hats, vases, Christmas lanterns, and more decorative materials. Dried stems are used for baskets and furniture. Water hyacinth fibers are used as raw material for paper. Since the plant has abundant nitrogen content, it can be used as a substrate for biogas production and the sludge obtained from the biogas. However, due to easy accumulation of toxins, the plant is prone to get contaminated when used as feed. The plant is extremely tolerant of, and has a high capacity for, the uptake of heavy metals, including cadmium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, lead and mercury, which could make it suitable for the biocleaning of industrial wastewater., , , In addition to heavy metals, Pontederia crassipes can also remove other toxins, such as cyanide, which is environmentally beneficial in areas that have endured gold mining operations. Water hyacinth has been widely introduced in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and New Zealand. In many areas it has become an important and pernicious invasive species. In New Zealand it is listed on the National Pest Plant Accord which prevents it from being propagated, distributed or sold. In large water areas such as Louisiana, the Kerala Backwaters in India, Tonl√© Sap in Cambodia and Lake Victoria it has become a serious pest. The common water hyacinth has become an invasive plant species on Lake Victoria in Africa after it was introduced into the area in the 1980s. When not controlled, water hyacinth will cover lakes and ponds entirely; this dramatically affects water flow and blocks sunlight from reaching native aquatic plants which often die. The decay processes depletes dissolved oxygen in the water, often killing fish. The plants also create a prime habitat for mosquitos, the classic vectors of disease, and a species of snail known to host a parasitic flatworm which causes schistosomiasis (snail fever). Directly blamed for starving subsistence farmers in Papua New Guinea, water hyacinth remains a major problem where effective control programs are not in place. Water hyacinth is often problematic in man-made ponds if uncontrolled, but can also provide a food source for goldfish, keep water clean and help to provide oxygen. Water hyacinth often invades bodies of water that have already been affected by human activities. For example, the plants can unbalance natural lifecycles in artificial reservoirs or in eutrophied lakes that receive large amounts of nutrients. Because of P. crassipes' invasiveness, several biological control agents have been released to control it, including two weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Neochetina bruchi Hustache and Neochetina eichhorniae Warner, and the moth Niphograpta albiguttalis (Warren) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).Julien, M.H., and Griffiths, M.W. (1998), Biological Control of Weeds: A World Catalogue of Agents and their Target Weeds (4th ed.), Oxon, UK: CABI Publishing, CAB International. Neochetina eichhorniae causes \\"a substantial reduction in water hyacinth production\\" (in Louisiana); it reduces plant height, weight, root length, and makes the plant produce fewer daughter plants. N. eichhorniae was introduced from Argentina to Florida in 1972. A semi-aquatic grasshopper, Cornops aquaticum, is being investigated in South Africa as an additional control agent.  United States  Introduction into the U. S. There are various accounts as to how the water hyacinth was introduced to the United States. ; The claim that the water hyacinth was introduced to the U. S. in 1884 at the World's Fair in New Orleans, also known as the World Cotton Centennial, has been characterized as the \\"first authentic account\\", as well as \\"local legend\\". ; At some time, there also appeared versions of the \\"legend\\" asserting that the plants had been given away as a gift by a Japanese delegation at the fair. This claim is absent in a pertinent article published in a military engineer's trade journal dating to 1940, but appears in a piece penned in 1941 by the director of the wildlife and fisheries division at the Louisiana Department of Conservation, where the author writes, \\"the Japanese Government maintained a Japanese building\\" at the fair, and the \\"Japanese staff imported from Venezuela considerable numbers of water hyacinth which were given away as souvenirs\\". The claim has been repeated by later writers, with various shifts in the details. Thus NAS fellow Noel D. Vietmeyer (1975) wrote that \\"Japanese entrepreneurs\\" introduced the plant into the U. S., and the plants had been \\"collected from the Orinoco River in Venezuela\\", and the claim was echoed along the same gist by a pair of NASA researchers (), who asserted that the souvenir plants were carelessly dumped in various waterways.: \\" Japanese exhibitors coming to the 1884 Cotton States Exposition in New Orleans, Louisiana, brought along this aquatic plant because of its beautiful lavender flowers. They had collected the water hyacinths from the Orinoco River in Venezuela. These plants were given away at the exposition as souvenirs\\". Canadian biologist Spencer C. H. Barrett (2004) meanwhile favored the theory they were first cultivated in garden ponds, after which they multiplied and escaped to the environs.: \\"..In that year water hyacinths imported from the lower Orinoco River in Venezuela were distributed as gifts by a Japanese delegation\\". The account gains a different detail as told by children's story- teller Carole Marsh (1992), who says \\"Japan gave away water hyancinth seeds\\" during the exposition, and another Southern raconteur, Gaspar J. \\"Buddy\\" Stall (1998) assured his readership that the Japanese gave each family a package of those seeds. ; One paper has also inquired into the role which catalog sales of seeds and plants may have played in the dissemination of invasive plants. It has been found that P. crassipes was offered in the 1884 issue of Bordentown, New Jersey-based Edmund D. Sturtevant's Catalogue of rare water lilies and other choice aquatic plants, and of Germany has offered the plant since 1864 (since the firm was founded). By 1895, it was offered by seed- purveyors in the states of NJ, NY, California, and Florida. The Harper's Weekly magazine (1895) printed an anecdotal account stating that a certain man from New Orleans collected and brought home water hyacinths he collected from Colombia, c. 1892, and the plant proliferated in a matter of 2 years.  Infestation and control in the South  As the hyanciths multiply into mats, they eliminate the presence of fish, and choke waterways for boating and shipping. This effect was well taking hold in the state of Louisiana by the turn of the 20th century. The plant invaded Florida in 1890, apud and an estimated 50 kg/m2 of the plant mass choked Florida's waterways. The clogging of the St. Johns River was posing a serious threat, and in 1897 the U. S. government dispatched a task force of military engineers (U. S. Army Corps of Engineers) to solve the water hyacinth problem plaguing the Gulf states such as Florida and Louisiana. Thus in the early 20th century, the U.S. War Department (i.e., the Army Corps of Engineers) tested various means of eradicating the plants, including the jet-streaming of steam and hot water, application of various strong acids, and application of petroleum followed by incineration. Spraying with saturated salt solution (but not dilute solutions) effectively killed the plants; unfortunately this was considered prohibitively expensive, and the engineers selected Harvesta brand herbicide, whose active ingredient was arsenic acid, as the optimal cost-effective tool for eradication. This herbicide was used until 1905, when it was substituted with a different, white arsenic based compound. An engineer charged with the spraying did not think the poison to be a matter of concern, stating that the crew of the spraying boat would routinely catch fish from their working areas and consume them. However, spraying had little hope of completely eradicating the water hyacinth, due to the vastness of escaped colonies and the inaccessibility of some of the infested areas, and the engineer suggested that some biological means of control may be needed. In 1910, a bold solution was put forth by the New Foods Society. Their plan was to import and release hippopotamus from Africa into the rivers and bayous of Louisiana. The hippopotamus would then eat the water hyacinth and also produce meat to solve another serious problem at the time, the American meat crisis. Known as the American Hippo bill, H.R. 23621 was introduced by Louisiana Congressman Robert Broussard and debated by the Agricultural Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. The chief collaborators in the New Foods Society and proponents of Broussard's bill were Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated American Scout, and Captain Fritz Duquesne, a South African Scout who later became a notorious spy for Germany. Presenting before the Agricultural Committee, Burnham made the point that none of the animals that Americans ate, chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, lambs, were native to the U.S.; all had been imported by European settlers centuries before, so why should Americans hesitate to introduce hippopotamus and other large animals into the American diet? Duquesne, who was born and raised in South Africa, further noted that European settlers on that continent commonly included hippopotamus, ostrich, antelope, and other African wildlife in their diets and suffered no ill effects. The American Hippo bill nearly passed, but fell one vote short. Ironically, water hyacinths have also been introduced into waters inhabited by manatees in Florida, for the purpose of bioremediation (cf. ¬ßPhotomremediation below) of the waters that have become contaminated and fallen victim to algal blooming. The manatees include the water hyacinth in their diet, but it may not be the food of first choice for them.

Africa  Water hyacinth at Kisumu Port The water hyacinth may have been introduced into Egypt in the late 18th to early 19th century during Muhammad Ali of Egypt's era, but was not recognized as an invasive threat until 1879. The invasion into Egypt is dated between 1879 and 1892 by Brij Gopal. Gopal; Junk; Davis (2000) , Biodiversity in Wetlands 2p. 109. The plant (Afrikaans: waterhiasint) arguably invaded South Africa in 1910,apud Gopal; Junk; Davis (2000) , Biodiversity in Wetlands 2p. 109. although earlier dates have been claimed. The plant was introduced by Belgian colonists to Rwanda to beautify their holdings. It then advanced by natural means to Lake Victoria where it was first sighted in 1988. There, without any natural enemies, it has become an ecological plague, suffocating the lake, diminishing the fish reservoir, and hurting the local economies. It impedes access to Kisumu and other harbors. The water hyacinth has also appeared in Ethiopia, where it was first reported in 1965 at the Koka Reservoir and in the Awash River, where the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority has managed to bring it under moderate control at considerable cost of human labor. Other infestations in Ethiopia include many bodies of water in the Gambela Region, the Blue Nile from Lake Tana into Sudan, and Lake Ellen near Alem Tena. Cited in By 2018, it has become a serious problem on Lake Tana in Ethiopia. The water hyacinth is also present on the Shire River in the Liwonde National Park in Malawi. Asia Haldia Municipality Pool, a public water reservoir is being choked by growing water hyacinth population as in December 2019. Water hyacinth was introduced to North America in 1884 and later to Asia, Africa, and Australia. Since there are no natural enemies in the new location, it can multiply quickly and cause disaster. The water hyacinth was introduced to Bengal, India because of its beautiful flowers and shapes of leaves, but turned out to be an invasive weed draining oxygen from the water bodies and resulted in devastation of fish stock., apud Petr, T. (2000) Interactions Between Fish and Aquatic Macrophytes in Inland Waters: A Review, p. 84 The water hyacinth was referred to as the \\"(Beautiful) Blue Devil\\" in Bengal, and \\"Bengal Terror\\" elsewhere in India; it was called \\"German weed\\" (Bengali: Germani pana) in Bangladesh out of belief the German Kaiser submarine mission was involved in introducing them at the outbreak of World War I; and called \\"Japanese trouble\\" in Sri Lanka, due to the rumor that the British had planted them in order to entice Japanese aircraft to land on the insecure pads. In Bangladesh, projects have begun to utilize water hyacinth for the construction of floating vegetable gardens. Water hyacinth has also invaded the Tonl√© Sap lake in Cambodia. An Osmose project in Cambodia is trying to fight it by having local people make baskets from it. The plant entered Japan in 1884 for horticultural appreciation, according to conventional wisdom, but a researcher devoted to the study of the plant has discovered that ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Kunisada (aka Utagawa Toyokuni III, d. 1865) produced a wood-block print featuring the water hyacinth, goldfish, and beautiful women, dated to 1855. The plant is floated on the water surface of filled (glassware) fishbowls, or glazed earthenware waterlily pots (hibachi pots serving as substitute). In the 1930s, water hyacinth was introduced into China as a feed, ornamental plant and sewage control plant, and it was widely planted in the south as an animal feed. Beginning in the 1980s, with the rapid development of China's inland industry, the eutrophication of inland waters has intensified. With the help of its efficient asexual reproduction and environmental adaptation mechanisms, water hyacinth has begun to spread widely in the river basin. The flood-water blue eyes blocked the river and hindered the internal water traffic. For example, many waterways in Zhejiang and other provinces were blocked by the rapidly growing water hyacinth. In addition, a large number of water hyacinths floating in the water will block sunlight from entering the water, and after decay, it will consume a lot of dissolved oxygen in the water, pollute the water quality, and cause a large number of deaths of other aquatic plants. The outbreak of water hyacinth has seriously affected the biodiversity of the local ecosystem and threatened the production, life and health of community residents. In Iraq, water hyacinth which was imported in the 1990s as a decorative plant, caused major problems for water supply systems and fishermen at the Euphrates. Europe In 2016, the European Union banned any sales of the water hyacinth in the EU.  Invasive species  Water hyacinth blue breeds quickly, is easy to float and spread, and can quickly cover the water body, resulting in poor water transparency. Therefore, in natural waters, water hyacinth blue competes with other aquatic (floating and submerged) plants and algae for mineral nutrition, sunlight, etc. Resources, thereby inhibiting the growth of other aquatic and algal organisms. In 2011, Wu Fuqin et al. tracked the results of Yunnan Dianchi Lake and also showed that water hyacinth could affect the photosynthesis of phytoplankton, submerged plants and algae by water environment quality and inhibit its growth. In addition, the outbreak of water hyacinth blue and its decay stage will consume a large amount of dissolved oxygen in the water body at the same time, and the space for reproduction of underwater animals such as fish will be reduced, and even a large number of fish will die. It is similar to changing the original food chain in the water body, thereby reducing the stability of the ecosystem in this water area. The massive explosive growth of water hyacinth blue often covers the water body where it is located, blocking river channels and waterways, and impeding water transportation. According to reports, a large area of water hyacinth has appeared in the lower reaches of the Han River in Wuhan for 20 consecutive days, posing a direct threat to the safe navigation of ships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. On the waters of the Yaojiang, Fenghua, and Minjiang rivers in Ningbo, Zhejiang, ships were also unable to sail because of the phoenix blue. Secondly, water hyacinth can absorb a large amount of harmful heavy metals and other substances. After death, it will rot and sink to the bottom of the water, causing secondary pollution to the water body, destroying the natural water quality, and may even affect the quality of residents' drinking water in severe cases. Third, due to the dense growth of water hyacinth blue, it brings great difficulties to fishermen and often destroys fishing gear, resulting in a large increase in fishing costs. The surface of the water body where water hyacinth grows heavily is often a breeding place for mosquitoes and harmful pathogens, posing a potential threat to the health of local residents. The invasion of water hyacinth also has socioeconomic consequences. Since water hyacinth is comprised up of 95% water, the evapotranspiration rate is high. As such, small lakes that have been covered with the species can dry out and leave communities without adequate water or food supply. In some areas, dense mats of water hyacinth prevents the use of a waterway, leading to the loss of transportation (both human and cargo) as well as a loss of fishing possibilities. Large sums of money are allocated to the removal of water hyacinth from the water bodies as well as figuring out how to destroy the remains harvested. Harvesting water hyacinth mechanically requires a lot of effort. A million tons of fresh biomass would require 75 trucks with a capacity of 40m^3, per day, for 365 days to get rid of a million tons of water hyacinth. The water hyacinth would then be transferred to a dumping site and allowed to decompose which releases CO2, CH4 and nitrous oxides which would all negatively impact the air quality and contribute to global warming. Control Control depends on the specific conditions of each affected location such as the extent of water hyacinth infestation, regional climate, and proximity to human and wildlife.  Chemical control  Chemical control is the least used out of the three controls of water hyacinth, because of its long-term effects on the environment and human health. The use of herbicides requires strict approval from governmental protection agencies of skilled technician to handle and spray the affected areas. The use of chemical herbicides is only used in case of severe infiltration of water hyacinth. However, the most successful use of herbicides is when it is used for smaller areas of infestation of water hyacinth. This is because in larger areas, more mats of water hyacinths are likely to survive the herbicides and can fragment to further propagate a large area of water hyacinth mats. In addition, it is more cost-effective and less laborious than mechanical control. Yet, it can lead to environmental effects as it can penetrate into the ground water system and can affect not only the hydrological cycle within an ecosystem but also negatively affect the local water system and human health. It is also notable that the use of herbicides is not strictly selective of water hyacinths; keystone species and vital organisms such as microalgae can perish from the toxins and can disrupt fragile food webs. The chemical regulation of water hyacinths can be done using common herbicides such as 2,4-D, glyphosate, and diquat. The herbicides are sprayed on the water hyacinth leaves and leads to direct changes to the physiology of the plant. The use of the herbicide known as 2,4-D leads to the death of water hyacinth through inhibition of cell growth of new tissue and cellular apoptosis. It can take almost a two-week period before mats of water hyacinth are destroyed with 2, 4-D. Between of water hyacinth and alligator weed are treated annually in Louisiana. The herbicide known as diquat is a liquid bromide salt that can rapidly penetrate the leaves of the water hyacinth and lead to immediate inactivity of plant cells and cellular processes. For the herbicide glyphosate, it has a lower toxicity than the other herbicides; therefore, it takes longer for the water hyacinth mats to be destroyed (about three weeks). The symptoms include steady wilting of the plants and a yellow discoloration of the plant leaves that eventually leads to plant decay.  Physical control  Physical control is performed by land-based machines such as bucket cranes, draglines, or boom or by water based machinery such as aquatic weed harvesters, dredges, or vegetation shredder. Mechanical removal is seen as the best short-term solution to the proliferation of the plant. A project on Lake Victoria in Africa used various pieces of equipment to chop, collect, and dispose of of water hyacinth in a 12-month period. It is, however, costly and requires the use of both land and water vehicles, but it took many years for the lake to become in poor condition and reclamation will be a continual process. It can have an annual cost from $6 million to $20 million and is only considered a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Another disadvantage with mechanical harvesting is that it can lead to further fragmentation of water hyacinths when the plants are broken up by spinning cutters of the plant- harvesting machinery. The fragments of water hyacinth that are left behind in the water can easily reproduce asexually and cause another infestation. However, transportation and disposal of the harvested water hyacinth is a challenge because the vegetation is heavy in weight. The harvested water hyacinth can pose a health risk to humans because of the plant's propensity for absorbing contaminants, and it is considered toxic to humans. Furthermore, the practice of mechanical harvesting is not effective in large-scale infestations of the water hyacinth, because this aquatic invasive species grows much more rapidly than it can be eliminated. Only of water hyacinth can be mechanically harvested daily because of the vast amounts of water hyacinths in the environment. Therefore, the process is very time-intensive.  Biological control  In 2010 the insect Megamelus scutellaris was released by the Agricultural Research Service as a biological control for water hyacinth. As chemical and mechanical removal is often too expensive, polluting, and ineffective, researchers have turned to biological control agents to deal with water hyacinth. The effort began in the 1970s when USDA researchers released into the United States three species of weevil known to feed on water hyacinth, Neochetina bruchi, N. eichhorniae, and the water hyacinth borer Sameodes albiguttalis. The weevil species were introduced into the Gulf Coast states, such as Louisiana, Texas, and Florida, where thousands of acres were infested by water hyacinth. It was found that a decade later in the 1980s that there was a decrease in water hyacinth mats by as much as 33%. However, because the life cycle of the weevils is ninety days, it puts a limitation on the use of biological predation to efficiently suppress water hyacinth growth. These organisms regulate water hyacinth by limiting water hyacinth size, its vegetative propagation, and seed production. They also carry microorganisms that can be pathological to the water hyacinth. These weevils eat stem tissue, which results in a loss of buoyancy for the plant, which will eventually sink. Although meeting with limited success, the weevils have since been released in more than 20 other countries. However, the most effective control method remains the control of excessive nutrients and prevention of the spread of this species. In May 2010, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service released Megamelus scutellaris as an additional biological control insect for the invasive water hyacinth species. Megamelus scutellaris is a small planthopper insect native to Argentina. Researchers have been studying the effects of the biological control agent in extensive host-range studies since 2006 and concluded that the insect is highly host-specific and will not pose a threat to any other plant population other than the targeted water hyacinth. Researchers also hope that this biological control will be more resilient than existing biological controls and the herbicides that are already in place to combat the invasive water hyacinth. Another insect being considered as a biological control agent is the semi-aquatic grasshopper Cornops aquaticum. This insect is specific to the water hyacinth and its family, and besides feeding on the plant, it introduces a secondary pathogenic infestation. This grasshopper has been introduced into South Africa in controlled trials. The introduction of manatees into waterways was reportedly successful in controlling the plant's growth in Guyana. Uses Bioenergy Because of its extremely high rate of development, Pontederia crassipes is an excellent source of biomass. of standing crop thus produces more than of biogas (70% , 30% ).

The labor involved in harvesting water hyacinth can be greatly reduced by locating collection sites and processors on impoundments that take advantage of prevailing winds. Wastewater treatment systems could also favorably be added to this operation. The harvested biomass would then be converted to ethanol, biogas, hydrogen, gaseous nitrogen, and/or fertilizer. The byproduct water can be used to irrigate nearby cropland. Phytoremediation, waste water treatment Water hyacinth removes arsenic from arsenic-contaminated drinking water. It may be a useful tool in removing arsenic from tube well water in Bangladesh.Misbahuddin, M.; Fariduddin, A.T.M. (2002). ‚ÄúWater Hyacinth Removes Arsenic from Arsenic-Contaminated Drinking Water‚Äù. Archives of Environmental Health. 57: 516- 518. Water hyacinth is also observed to enhance nitrification in wastewater treatment cells of living technology. Their root zones are superb micro-sites for bacterial communities. Water hyacinth is a common fodder plant in the third world especially Africa though excessive use can be toxic. It is high in protein (nitrogen) and trace minerals and the goat feces are a good source of fertilizer as well. Water hyacinth is reported for its efficiency to remove about 60‚Äì80% nitrogenFox, LJ; Struik, PC; Appleton, BL; Rule, JH; et al.

Biores Tech 98:226‚Äì231 The roots of water hyacinth were found to remove particulate matter and nitrogen in a natural shallow eutrophicated wetland.Billore, SK; Bharadio, R; Kumar, A; et al.

Curr Sci 74:154‚Äì156 The plant can also screen heavy metals and various other toxins from contaminated water. The roots of Pontederia crassipes naturally absorb pollutants, including lead, mercury, and strontium-90, as well as some organic compounds believed to be carcinogenic, in concentrations 10,000 times that in the surrounding water. Water hyacinths can be cultivated for waste water treatment (especially dairy waste water). Agriculture In places where water hyacinth is invasive, overabundant, and in need of clearing away, these traits make it free for the harvesting, which makes it very useful as a source of organic matter for composting in organic farming. It is used internationally for fertilizer and as animal feed. In Bengal, India the kachuri-pana has been used primarily for fertilizer, compost or mulch, and secondarily as fodder for livestock and fish. In Bangladesh, farmers in the southwestern region cultivate vegetables on \\"floating gardens\\" usually with a bamboo-built frame base, with dried mass of water hyacinth covered in soil as bedding. As a large portion of cultivable land goes under water for months during monsoon in this low-lying region, farmers have grown this method for many decades now. The method of this agriculture is known by many names including dhap chash and vasoman chash. In Kenya, East Africa, it has been used experimentally as organic fertilizer, although there is controversy stemming from the high alkaline pH value of the fertilizer. Other uses In various places in the world world-wide, the plant is used for making furniture, handbags, baskets, rope, and household goods/interior products (lampshades, picture frames) by businesses launched by NGOs and entrepreneurs. Woven products American-Nigerian Achenyo Idachaba has won an award for showing how this plant can be exploited for profit as woven procuts in Nigeria. Paper Though a study found water hyacinths of very limited use for paper production, they are nonetheless being used for paper production on a small scale. Goswami pointed out in his article that water hyacinth blue has the potential to make tough and strong paper. He found that adding water hyacinth blue pulp to the raw material of bamboo pulp for anti-grease paper can increase the physical strength of paper. Edibility The plant is used as a carotene-rich table vegetable in Taiwan. Javanese sometimes cook and eat the green parts and inflorescence. Vietnamese also cook the plant and sometimes add its young leaves and flower to their salads. Medicinal use In Kedah (Malaysia), the flowers are used for medicating the skin of horses. The species is a \\"tonic\\".Duke, J.A.; Wain, K.K (1981) Medicinal plants of the world. 3 vols. Potential as bioherbicidal agent Water hyacinth leaf extract has been shown to exhibit phytotoxicity against another invasive weed Mimosa pigra. The extract inhibited the germination of Mimosa pigra seeds in addition to suppressing the root growth of the seedlings. Biochemical data suggested that the inhibitory effects may be mediated by enhanced hydrogen peroxide production, inhibition of soluble peroxidase activity, and stimulation of cell wall-bound peroxidase activity in the root tissues of Mimosa pigra.

The original architect had been C. W. Stephens, who designed Harrods, but work had stopped at the outbreak of the First World War, and Stephens died in 1917.. The building is a fine example with a mansard roof and Portland stone facade. The building is Grade II listed and has 303 bedrooms on eight floors with the front overlooking Green Park towards Buckingham Palace. The hotel was bought by ITT Sheraton in April 1996 for $70 million. ITT Sheraton was itself bought by Starwood Hotels in 1998. Starwood sold their leasehold on the hotel to Sir Richard Sutton's Settled Estates in 2014, but continues to operate the property, under a long-term management contract. Though the hotel was a Sheraton property from 1996 on, it did not actually begin using the Sheraton name for twenty years, until 19 July 2016, when it was renamed Sheraton Grand London Park Lane upon the completion of a major renovation.

As a child the family moved to Eccles, and she attended Stretford High School for Girls. Trade union career She began her career as a trade unionist as a teenager, initially as a member of the National Union of Printing, Bookbinding and Paper Workers. In 1972 she became assistant secretary of the Manchester branch of the print union SOGAT (Society of Graphical and Allied Trades), and became involved in negotiations over the introduction of new technology to the printing industry. Rising through the union hierarchy, she became President of SOGAT in 1983, and was elected as its General Secretary in 1985, becoming \\"the first woman elected to lead a major industrial union\\". She recognised the threats to her members' jobs of impending changes in the print industry, and, it later became clear, held private meetings with Rupert Murdoch in secret to discuss his plans. During the Wapping dispute of 1986/87, she \\"became one of the best-known trade union leaders in Britain.\\" However, in her attempts to resolve the strike, \\"she was bitterly denounced by some people in the militant Fleet Street chapels (union branches) as a ‚ÄúJudas‚Äù, she was derided as ‚Äúa film star‚Äù because of her blond good looks and her leadership was decried when she put the survival of the union, with 90% of its members in the provinces, ahead of what was essentially a London dispute.\\" In 1991, SOGAT became part of the Graphical, Paper and Media Union.

They were established in 1964 and were named after the Venta River. In 1967, they won the Latvian cup(the following year they lost in the finals). In 1969 they won the Latvian championship. In 2004 after earning promotion to Virslƒ´ga the club moved to Kuldƒ´ga (as Ventspils already had one Virslƒ´ga club ‚Äì FK Ventspils). In 2005 the club went bankrupt. Club history The club was founded in 1964 as Naftas bƒÅze, in its debut season in the Latvian league it finished 6th from 14 teams. In 1965 the club name was changed to Osta and it earned silver medals in the Latvian league. In 1967 Osta won the Latvian Cup 2:0 against Elektrons Rƒ´ga. In 1968 the club was renamed to ‚Äì FK Venta, it reached the cup finals again in 1968 and 1969 but lost both times. In 1969 Venta won the first Latvian league title for Ventspils under Vladimirs ƒåiki≈Üovs, a former FK Daugava Rƒ´ga footballer. Half of the 1969 league winners were local Ventspils footballers, while the others were from various places, mostly from Belarus. As the Latvian league was officially an amateur competition, for 3 months a year the Venta players had to work in the city port. In 1970 Venta finished second in the league but then the results started to decline and after the 1982 season the club lost most of its financial support. Venta could not complete the 1983 season and was expelled from the league after having lost its first 19 matches. Until 1988 Venta mostly under different names played in the lower Latvian leagues, but in 1988 it returned to the top Latvian league under the name Zvezda, in their squad it had one of the future defenders of the Latvia national football team ‚Äì Mihails Zemƒºinskis. However the sides results were poor and in 1989 under the Venta name the club left the top league. With the collapse of the Soviet Union for several years Venta went into total oblivion, until it re-emerged in the 1st Latvian league in 1994. After the 1994 season the club split into two halves ‚Äì one of them as Venta continued playing in the first league, but another as FK Nafta appeared in the 2nd Latvian league. In 1996 Venta finished in the 1st league lower than Nafta. After the 1996 season Venta and Nafta merged into FK Ventspils which got a promotion to Virslƒ´ga (thanks to decline of playing in Virslƒ´ga by FK Vecrƒ´ga). Later Ventspils emerged as a new football club under the name of Venta. In 2004 they finished second in the Latvian 1. lƒ´ga and played playoffs against the team that finished 7th in the league above them (Virslƒ´ga), FC Ditton-2. They won both legs 1:0 and were consequently promoted. Before the 2005 season the club moved to Kuldƒ´ga and stated its great ambitions to become one of the leading Latvian clubs over a few years, it bought several popular footballers both from Latvia and from other post-Soviet countries ‚Äì including former Arsenal London defender Oleg Luzhny, Valentƒ´ns Loba≈Üovs and Aliaksandr Khatskevich ‚Äì a FC Dynamo Kiev veteran.

The complete works of Uchimura consist of some 50 volumes: of which, 17 are primarily biblical studies, 25 are volumes of theological works, and 8 are volumes of diaries and correspondence. Many of his disciples have likewise been well-known intellectual figures. Today it is believed that 35,000 people belong to the movement in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. About During the lifetime of Uchimura Kanz≈ç, a graduate of Amherst College, the non- church movement took several organizational forms. His direct disciples were essentially paying members of his private school. As subscribers to his magazine grew, supporters outside Tokyo sought some ongoing relationship with other non-church members. Uchimura organized the Ky≈çyukai (, or literally, \\"Meeting of Friends in Faith\\") in 1905, with 14 branches and 119 members. The purpose of this organization was defined in the following profession of faith: > We who believe in God and his Only Son whom he sent (into the world), > uniting together, form the Ky≈çyukai. With the help of God the Father we > shall help our comrades and live lives that are in harmony with His > Sovereign Will. Membership was restricted to individuals who had \\"endeavored to live the Christian life for at least a year\\". The guidelines for this association included a commitment to meet monthly, to spend Sunday nurturing faith and morals, and to abstain from tobacco and liquor. They hold to no liturgy, sacraments, or ordained clergy. While most of the teachers have no formal theological training, some have extensive background in theology and biblical studies and hold academic positions in universities and theological schools. Bible study is performed in small, independent groups led by individual teachers, or \\"sensei\\", and the groups often meet on a weekly basis. Each group is normally called shukai (Meeting) or seisho shukai (Bible Meeting). While many sensei hold regular jobs outside of their role as a Bible teacher, a few are called into a full-time ministry as dokuritsu dendosha (independent evangelists). When the teacher dies or retires, the study group normally dissolves, and often new groups branch out from the old group. With its emphases on Bible studies and social criticism and its general intellectual tendencies among the adherents, the movement produced a number of prominent figures in scholarship. Among them are: Tsukamoto Toraji (biblical scholar), Tadao Yanaihara (economist and president of the University of Tokyo), Nanbara Shigeru (political scientist and also president of the University of Tokyo), Oga Ichiro (botanist), Sekine Masao (Hebrew scholar and Member of the Japan Academy), Nakazawa Koki (biblical scholar), and Takahashi Saburo (theologian and independent evangelist). In Japan, the Muky≈çkai members are perhaps best known for speaking out against social injustices. They were one of the groups to take positions against Japanese nationalism and militarism in the 1930s and '40s, and remain today strong advocates for pacifism.

Its name is from Gaelic, meaning field of hard water. History Achallader Castle was built near the northern end of Loch Tulla, close to the Bridge of Orchy, sometime in the 16th century and added to over the decades by various Clans; mainly the McHoughtons, of which Jimmy McHoughton is the youngest generation. It is accepted that the Fletcher's, known then as Macinleister \\"were the first to 'raise smoke and boil water' on the Braes of Glenorchy\\" although the MacGregors were also a ruling Clan of the area in the 15th century. Sir Duncan Campbell of Glen Orchy acquired the castle and surrounding lands through his treachery and betrayal of the Chief of the Mcinleisters in 1587. It is said that when the Fletchers owned Achallader, Sir Duncan Campbell - known as Black Duncan - ordered an English servant (or soldier) to pasture his horse in the Fletchers‚Äô corn. When warned off by the Fletchers - in Gaelic - he did not understand; when he did not remove his horse they shot him. Black Duncan, affecting concern that the Fletcher laird would be hanged for the killing, advised him to flee to France. Before he fled he passed the property to Black Duncan, supposedly until his return, to prevent it being forfeited to the Crown. The Fletchers never recovered the property. The MacGregors burnt the castle in 1603. In the summer of 1683 a Commission for the settlement of the Highlands, led by Sir William Drummond of Cromlix stayed at the castle, welcoming, among others McIain, a future victim, with his clan, of the massacre of Glencoe. In 1689, with William III and Mary II now reigning, the McIain's returning from their victory at Killiecrankie and repulse at Dunkeld, pulled down what they could of the castle. It was never restored. In June 1691 John, Earl of Breadalbane, empowered by King William to treat with the clans, conferred with the highland chiefs in the ruin of the castle. By a mixture of threats, promises of bribes, and duplicity, he persuaded most of the clans - but not the McIains - to enter a treaty. This included secret provisions, which he later denied, including the right of the chiefs to request relief from their oaths of allegiance from the exiled James VII and II. The promised bribes did not materialise. Description The castle formerly rose to three storeys and a garret, well defended by shot-holes. Now only two walls, one with a trace of corbelling, remain, sheltering the farm buildings of Achallader Farm. It is protected as a scheduled monument.

History  First incorporated as Allegany Hospital in 1905, the Daughters of Charity were asked to come to Cumberland to operate the hospital in 1911. The hospital was renamed as Sacred Heart Hospital in 1935. It moved from its original site on Decatur Street to the Seton Drive facility in 1967. Sacred Heart Hospital became part of the Daughters of Charity National Health System when the national system was formed in 1986. In 1999, the Daughters of Charity National Health System merged with the Sisters of St. Joseph Health System to create Ascension Health, one of the largest not-for-profit healthcare systems in the country. In an effort to effectively manage local healthcare resources, Memorial Hospital (Cumberland) and Sacred Heart Hospital joined together in April 1996 to form the Western Maryland Health System (WMHS). Working together, the two hospitals were able to expand the range of healthcare services available to local residents and successfully meet the challenges associated with an ever-changing healthcare industry. One way this was accomplished was by assigning specialty centers to each hospital. The Memorial Campus had specialty centers for Children's and Adolescents' Health, Orthopedic and Joint Reconstruction, Trauma Services, and Women's Health, while the Sacred Heart Campus specialized in Behavioral Health, Cardiac Services, Oncology Services, and Outpatient Services. In 2005, the Western Maryland Health System made the decision to build a new hospital in Cumberland that would replace both Memorial and Sacred Heart hospitals. Because Memorial was a secular hospital while Sacred Heart was a Catholic hospital, this presented a unique set of circumstances for the health system. In 2006, the Daughters of Charity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, no longer being involved with Sacred Heart Hospital, requested that the name Sacred Heart be dropped. The Western Maryland Health System then referred to Sacred Heart Hospital as WMHS Braddock Campus. Work also began that year on a new facility on Willowbrook Road in Cumberland to consolidate the Western Maryland Health System within the city into one centralized facility. On November 21, 2009, the Western Maryland Regional Medical Center opened. By 3:30 pm that day, all patients from both Memorial Hospital and WMHS Braddock Campus had been moved to the new hospital and the two facilities were closed. In December 2011, the City of Cumberland and WMHS closed a deal to swap the health system owned former Sacred Heart campus for city owned property adjacent to the new hospital. The city's acquisition of the Sacred Heart campus would provide a campus to replace the aging Allegany High School located nearby. Prospective plans for the site are to demolish the structures and use the land for a new school and athletic facilities.

A few years later, Henske's career was faltering as a result of ill-advised forays into cabaret while Yester had produced albums by Tim Buckley and The Association, and replaced Zal Yanovsky in The Lovin' Spoonful. The pair, with their new-born daughter, moved to Los Angeles in 1968. Henske shared a manager, Herb Cohen, with Frank Zappa, who suggested to her that she should put music to some of the verse she was writing. Yester, at this point, was working with Yanovsky on the latter's first solo album, and experimenting with new electronic and other sound effects. The couple combined to put together Farewell Aldebaran, drawing on a varied selection of their musician friends, and it was issued on Zappa and Cohen's new label. Music The album was based around Henske's lyrics, many of which were verses written when she had a high fever: \\"an extraordinary group of literate song-poems setting oblique commentary on their life and her past against evocations of the fate of a fallen knight, a mare‚Äôs connection with the man who had stolen her, and the biography of a ship named Charity which yearned for a safe harbour.\\" At the time, Yester and Yanovsky were co-producing Pat Boone's album Departure, and over a six-month period they used Boone's own studio to record Farewell Aldebaran. Musicians on the album, besides Yester, Henske, and Yanovsky, included David Lindley, Paul Beaver, Dick Rosmini, Larry Beckett, and Ray Brown. \\"Farewell Aldebaran: The definitive space-blues-Arthurian-bubblegum album\\", The Mojo Collection, Canongate Books, 2007, p,168 \\"An Evening with Judy Henske & Jerry Yester\\", Grammy Museum, 2016. Retrieved 30 June 2020 The opener, \\"Snowblind\\", issued as a single, is a guitar driven rocker that is enough in itself to establish Henske as a peerless rock vocalist and an able, witty lyricist. This is immediately followed by \\"Horses on a Stick\\", an almost parodic piece of \\"sunshine pop\\", Yester's polka harmonium reminiscent of a fairground steam-organ. Next is the sombre, spacious, marxophone-fractured \\"Lullaby\\" and then the melodramatic \\"St. Nicholas Hall\\", its satirical anti- clerical lyrics matched by choral samples from the Chamberlin keyboard. \\"Three Ravens\\", a sublime slice of baroque pop, fully orchestrated, based upon a Scottish folk lyric, is especially revered. \\"Raider\\", which has been described as an \\"acid sea shanty\\", has a bluegrass feel created by bowed banjo and dulcimer backing a folksy-sounding but surreal lyric. \\"Mrs Connor\\" strays into jazz-balladry, piano-led, as Yester details stark old age. \\"Rapture\\" is a highly atmospheric rock waltz with lyrics comparing the magic of love to the moment of death. The upbeat \\"Charity\\", sung by Yester to acoustic guitars and powerful vocal harmonies, tells of a sailing ship doomed to sail for ever. Finally the title track, featuring electronically treated vocals and Moog synthesizer, is a unique piece of \\"space-rock\\" based upon an insistent bass- drum, full of rushing, wailing and bleeping sounds as Yester intones \\"the comets cling to her, the fiery bride, she is the mother of the mark and the prize, the glaze of paradise is in her eyes, her mouth is torn with stars...\\" before the track fades into chaos. According to the Allmusic reviewer: \\"What holds Farewell Aldebaran together is the strength of the songs and arrangements, where Yester brings together a striking range of sounds and moods, and makes imaginative use of mellotrons and early Moog synthesizers. Henske rarely sounded this nuanced and effective on record, mainly because Yester gave her musical landscapes that were big enough for her talent and personality.\\" Reception The album was not a commercial success, deemed \\"too eclectic and deliberately eccentric to find a place on radio\\". However, In the UK, the album was broadcast by John Peel who played \\"Three Ravens\\" on Radio One, and it gained a cult following over the years.

He stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate in East Grinstead, West Sussex, in 1964, and in a 1965 by-election. He then stood in Braintree, Essex, in October 1974. He later sought election at the more promising Cheltenham at the 1983 general election and at the 1987 general election. He was awarded a CBE in the 1983 New Year's Honours. After the Liberal Party's merger with SDP in 1988, he joined the newly formed Liberal Democrats. He later said that he believed that had the merger happened before the 1987 general election, then the party could have attracted more votes and seats at that election and displaced Labour in the opposition. However, the merger did not happen sooner because of objections from SDP leader David Owen, who resigned later in 1987.

His act with dummy Charlie Brown had Charlie do all the talking, while Worsley himself remained \\"silent\\". Early years He was born in Failsworth, near Manchester, Lancashire. At the age of eight he saw a ventriloquist for the first time which gave him the ambition to become a ventriloquist himself. Career Worsley made his first stage appearance at age 11 at the Casino, Rusholme, Manchester, billed as the \\"World's Youngest Ventriloquist\\". His London debut took place four years later. He was soon playing at principal theatres around the country and later around the world. In the days of live variety, he was a regular at the UK's top venue, the London Palladium. He became well known in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the US. He appeared on most of the variety shows on British TV and was one of the few British acts who achieved success in the US, appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show in the United States returning to perform a variation of his act for ten years in a row. He was called \\"the greatest ventriloquist in the world\\" by Ed Sullivan, who hired him to appear in what turned out to be the third and last appearance by singer Elvis Presley on his show, on 6 January 1957, a program which was broadcast live from the old CBS Studio 50 in NYC and drawing some 50 million TV viewers, as revealed by Trendex figures the week after. Technique Ed Sullivan admired Worsley's ventriloquism act because, in addition to being funny, Worsley's technique was so perfect that he could appear in tight close-up exhibiting no discernible lip movements while his \\"figure\\" (dummy) appeared to be speaking. It is almost impossible to form the plosive consonants \\"B\\" and \\"P\\" without some movement of the lips; ventriloquists traditionally substitute another consonant. As part of Worsley's act, his dummy would shout the phrase \\"Bottle of beer!\\" repeatedly while Worsley's lips remained motionless; invariably, this brought a round of applause. Act All the talking was done by his dummy Charlie Brown, who would turn to the impassive Worsley and say, \\"Look at me, son, when I'm talking to you\\". For most of Worsley's act, Charlie would abuse him, growing ever more exasperated by the ventriloquist's silence. Worsley would accept Charlie's tirades with a Buster Keaton-like implacability, on rare occasions a barely detectable rise of the eyebrow, on still rarer ones a slight smirk. In due time, Charlie would work himself up into a frenzy and start shrieking at Worsley. Not only was this funny, it also allowed Worsley to show off his skills. Personal life He married Audrey (n√©e Hewitt), a stage performer. They had one son, Michael. Later years He retired from the stage at the age of 63 in 1983 and never performed with Charlie again. He died in 2001 in Blackpool, Lancashire, aged 80. He is buried at Carleton Cemetery, Blackpool, in plot E794.

The film was directed by Wallace Worsley and is based on Barry Pain's 1897 novel The Octave of Claudius. The film, which features Wallace Beery in an unbilled cameo as an ape-man, is now considered lost. Plot The film is a contemporary (1920s, though the book was published in 1897) picture that takes place in New York City. The story involves a mad scientist who turns circumstances on a young man to do his bidding. Robert Sandell (Raymond McKee), despondent over his bad luck as a writer and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb (Lon Chaney), a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell (Virginia True Boardman) on one consideration ‚Äì that Robert shall, at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife (Fontaine La Rue) and a grotesque hunchback (Lon Chaney, in a dual role), whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter Angela (Jacqueline Logan) and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners ‚Äì previously failed experiments of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain, for his book has been published and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, the hunchback releases a cage door, and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \\"blind bargain\\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony. In a medical operating room, Robert Sandell (Raymond McKee) is shocked by what he has read in the notepad that the Hunchback (Lon Chaney) has given him.  Cast  Background and production Based on Barry Pain's novel, The Octave of Claudius, A Blind Bargain tied together horrific elements for which Lon Chaney became so well known. His characterizations of both Dr. Lamb and the hunchback assistant showcased Chaney's talent for makeup. For the finale, the ape-man that is released upon Dr. Lamb was played by Wallace Beery, in a cameo performance. Release and reception The film was released December 3, 1922, at the Capitol Theater in New York, and met with a standing ovation the opening night of the film. Critical response for the film was good, most praising Lon Chaney's dual performance as the mad doctor and his servant as being the highlight of the picture.  Preservation and technical specifications  A lobby card, for the film, depicting Raymond McKee, as the main character, with his mother. Today, the film is considered lost. The original negative was destroyed in 1931 by MGM several years after the takeover of Goldwyn Studios, and the last surviving print is believed to have perished in the same 1965 fire in Vault #7 that destroyed the last known prints of London After Midnight and other Chaney films. The footage count in the film was . The film was tinted and toned various colors, including blue tone/flesh tint, blue tint, night amber, straw amber, light lavender, green tint, and one sequence at a party was stencil colored using the Handschiegl Color Process, in multi-coloring bubbles that were made during a party.Original cutting continuity.  Influences  Three years after A Blind Bargain was released, Chaney's co-star, Ray McKee, appeared with Clara Bow in a film titled Free to Love. McKee's character is a criminal who is a hunchback. This character is the direct result of McKee's working with Chaney in A Blind Bargain and shows the Chaney influence on McKee. The character is a strange amalgam of Chaney's character in A Blind Bargain and of his real-life hunchback co-stars, John George, who was a Chaney regular in several films.
