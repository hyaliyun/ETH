Weatherson also played for Newcastle Blue Star, Queen of the South and Annan Athletic. Weatherson was also joint player-manager of Shettleston in the Scottish Juniors, West Region. Weatherson started his senior career with Dumfries club Queen of the South from 2000 until 2003, after initially playing with local club Newcastle Blue Star. Weatherson then went on to play for Greenock Morton for a decade from 2003 until 2013 and then Annan Athletic from 2013 until 2016, before going to Shettleston in the Scottish Juniors, West Region as joint player-manager. Weatherson returned to Annan Athletic for a second spell on 13 January 2017, leaving Shettleston after only five months in charge and retired from playing football at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season, as he approached 37 years old on 29 May 2017. Career Early years Born in North Shields, Weatherson began his career with local non-league club Newcastle Blue Star. Queen of the South In the summer of 2000, John Connolly, the Dumfries club Queen of the South's manager, signed Weatherson to play in the Scottish Football League, where he mainly featured as a striker and occasionally played as a right midfielder. During the 2001‚Äì02 season, Weatherson scored 15 league goals in 33 league appearances, as the Palmerston Park club won the Scottish Football League Second Division Championship. Under the captaincy of Jim Thomson, the title was clinched after a 3‚Äì0 win at Forfar Athletic on 20 April 2002. In that match, Weatherson scored the first two Queens goals and the third goal was scored by Sean O'Connor, who Queens signed from Dundee United, having watched him play for Greenock Morton during his loan spell at Cappielow. At the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, Partick Thistle made an offer of ¬£10,000 to Queens for Weatherson, however this offer was rejected and this allowed Greenock Morton to table a bid of ¬£30,000 that was then accepted by Queens. Greenock Morton Weatherson moved from Dumfries to Greenock at the start of the 2003‚Äì04 season. Weatherson scored 14 league goals in 31 league appearances in his first season, scoring a total of 20 goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. Morton led by 12 points at New Year before Weatherson broke a metatarsal ruling him out injured for six weeks. Their form promptly collapsed compounded by allegations of a booze culture among players and toxifying unproven rumours reported in the press of Weatherson and other players betting against Morton. Morton finished fourth. Weatherson started playing in defence after manager Jim McInally used him as a utility centre- back in a 7‚Äì1 Tennent's Scottish Cup win away at Cove Rangers. Weatherson played at right back for Greenock Morton in the 2006‚Äì07 season, from where he still scored goals. On 6 October 2007 Weatherson scored a hat-trick versus Partick Thistle as a striker. On 10 March 2007, Peter Weatherson scored his 100th career goal in a 3‚Äì0 victory versus Alloa Athletic at Recreation Park. Weatherson was the Greenock club's top scorer for the 2006‚Äì07 season, scoring four goals in a 9‚Äì1 win at Cappielow versus Forfar Athletic and his season's total was then 17 goals, 15 of them scored from playing in defence and 2 from playing in midfield. Weatherson finished four of his first seven seasons at Greenock Morton as the club's leading goalscorer. The seasons when Weatherson did not achieve this feat was the 2005‚Äì06 season, when he finished second behind returning fans' favourite Derek Lilley, then in season 2008‚Äì09 when he finished second again, this time behind Brian Wake and finally in season 2010‚Äì11, when he finished third behind Brian Graham, who was first and Allan Jenkins, who was second. Weatherson is Ton's fourth highest post-World War II league goalscorer with 93 league goals, 5 goals short of another former Queens striker, Rowan Alexander with 98 league goals, who is in third. (See table on club page). After scoring the first of his two goals versus Queens on 8 November 2008, Weatherson reached the milestone of 100 league goals in the Scottish Football League, having scored 38 goals for Queens and at that particular time, 62 goals for Greenock Morton. In January 2010, Weatherson signed a two-year extension to his existing contract, after rejecting an approach by Partick Thistle for the second time in his career. On 16 October 2010, versus Queens at Cappielow, Weatherson's brace of goals were his 100th and 101st for Greenock Morton, in all competitions. In May 2012, Weatherson received another one-year extension to his contract, after which he was granted a testimonial for playing a decade at the Renfrewshire club. Weatherson's testimonial match was versus St Johnstone on 13 July 2013, even though he had already signed for the Dumfries and Galloway club, Annan Athletic for season 2013‚Äì14. Weatherson departed Greenock Morton in the summer of 2013, having played well over 400 matches and scoring 121 goals in all competitions. Annan Athletic In the summer of 2013, Weatherson signed for Annan Athletic. On 27 July 2013, Weatherson scored versus former club Greenock Morton as Annan Athletic won 1‚Äì0 and knocked the Greenock club out of the Scottish Challenge Cup. In May 2015, Weatherson signed a contract extension at Annan Athletic for the 2015‚Äì16 season. Shettleston Juniors Weatherson was then announced as one of the joint player-managers at Shettleston in March 2016, alongside his Galabankies teammate Ryan McStay, with their tenure to commence at the start of the 2016‚Äì17 season in the Scottish Juniors, West Region. Weatherson departed Shettleston by mutual consent, alongside joint player-manager McStay on 9 January 2017, after a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Irvine Meadow on 7 January 2017.http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/15012547.Co_bosses_Peter_Weatherson_and_Ryan_McStay_leave_Shettleston_by_mutual_consent/ Return to Annan Athletic Weatherson signed for a second spell at Scottish League Two club Annan Athletic on 13 January 2017, as he re-signed for the Galabankies for the rest of the 2016‚Äì17 season, less than one week after leaving Shettleston, where he was joint player-manager. Retirement Weatherson announced his retirement from playing football at the end of the 2016-17 season, as he approached 37 years old on 29 May 2017.

The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples. Under a single-payer system, most medical care would be paid for by the federal government, ending the need for private health insurance and premiums, and recasting private insurance companies as providing purely supplemental coverage, to be used when non-essential care is sought. The national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but also by savings realized through the provision of preventive universal healthcare and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs. An analysis of the bill by Physicians for a National Health Program estimated the immediate savings at $350 billion per year.Physicians for a National Health Program (2008) \\"Single Payer System Cost?\\" Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to preventive healthcare. Preventive care can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year in the U.S., because for example cancer patients are more likely to be diagnosed at Stage I where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at Stage III or later in an emergency room where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal. During the 2009 health care debates over the bill that became the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 676 was expected to be debated and voted upon by the House in September 2009, but was never debated. On September 13, 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a parallel bill in the United States Senate with 16 cosponsors. The act would establish a universal single-payer healthcare system in the United States. In 2019, the original 16 year-old proposal was renumbered and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) introduced a broadly similar but more detailed bill, HR 1384, in the 116th Congress. , it had 116 cosponsors still in the House at the time, or 49.8% of House Democrats. Elements The laws proposed are not necessarily identical year-over-year.  116th Congress (2019‚Äì2020)  Pramila Jayapal's Medicare for All Act of 2019, introduced in the House is broadly similar but more detailed than the original Conyers proposal, but the \\"parallel\\" proposal by Sanders has significant differences, including a \\"global budget\\" system for hospitals. Both proposals contain expansive coverage including long-term care and dental care with no cost-sharing such as coinsurance, deductibles, or premiums, which as of 2019 is unprecedented in the world. Under the House version, funding for institutions such as hospitals would be negotiated with regional directors, while individual providers would be paid a fee-for-service. Value-based pay for performance incentives would not be allowed. HHS would have administrative authority to set various details. The Senate proposal sets out a four-year transition plan and the House proposal is two years. As of April 2019, the Senate proposal did not include details on how to completely pay for the plan, but Sanders had released a paper listing ideas.  111th Congress (2009‚Äì2010)  The summary of the National Health Care Act as proposed in the 111th Congress (2009‚Äì2010) includes the following elements, among others: # Expands the Medicare program to provide all individuals residing in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and territories of the United States with tax-funded health care that includes all medically necessary care. That would include primary and preventive care, prescription drugs, emergency care, long-term care, mental health services, dental services, and vision care. # Prohibits an institution from participating unless it is a public or nonprofit institution. Allows nonprofit health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that deliver care in their own facilities to participate. On the whole, private insurance would be replaced with the new nationalized system for all basic, major care. # Gives patients the freedom to choose from participating physicians and institutions, which, given the coverage of the new national system, would be any institution or clinic in the United States receiving any degree of public funding (the vast majority). # Prohibits a private health insurer from selling health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act. Allows the private insurers to sell benefits not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery benefits. # Sets forth methods to pay institutional providers of care and health professionals for services. Prohibits financial incentives between HMOs and physicians based on utilization. # Establishes the USNHC Trust Fund to finance the Program with amounts deposited: (1) from existing sources of government revenues for health care; (2) by increasing personal income taxes on the top 5% of income earners; (3) by instituting a progressive excise tax on payroll and self-employment income; and (4) by instituting a small tax on stock and bond transactions. Transfers and appropriates amounts that would have been appropriated for federal public health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Taxes would be paid instead of insurance premiums, as the government (instead of private insurance companies) would be paying for the care under the single-payer health care. # Establishes a program to assist individuals whose jobs are eliminated (such as within insurance companies) by the simplified single-payer administrative process. # Requires creation of a confidential electronic patient record system. # Establishes a National Board of Universal Quality and Access to provide advice on quality, access, and affordability. # Provides for the eventual integration of the Indian Health Service into the Program and evaluation of the continued independence of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health programs. # The bill covers treatments starting on the first day of the year that follows one year after the date of passage. # Compensation continues for 15 years to owners of converting for-profit providers for reasonable financial losses. Cost An analysis of the bill by Physicians for a National Health Program estimated the immediate savings at $350 billion per year. Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to the extended preventive healthcare and the elimination of insurance company overhead costs. A study estimated the 1999 costs of U.S. health care administration at nearly $300 billion, accounting for 30.1% of health care expenses, versus 16.7% in Canada. This study estimated the U.S. per-person administrative cost at $1,059. Charles Blahouse, who worked as George W. Bush's economic advisor and as a public trustee for medicare and social security, wrote a Mercatus Center study of the 2017 proposal It claims that Sanders' M4A plan will increase federal spending by at least $32 trillion but that the savings on administrative and other costs could save $2 trillion in healthcare costs. However, Blahouse stresses that these savings rely on multiple generous assumptions and that the plan will likely cost significantly more. A 2019 analysis was critical of Sanders bill for allowing accountable care organizations and failing to include a provision to negotiate budgets with hospitals. According to a 2020 study in The Lancet, the Medicare for All Act was estimated to save 13% in national health-care expenditure (equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually), and save more than 68,500 lives every year. However, this study was criticized for including an author affiliated with the Sanders campaign, as well as being conducted by epidemiologists rather than economists.  Version history  The House single-payer law was proposed under the same HR 676 number since 2003 until the 116th Congress in 2019 when it was changed because it was introduced later, but similar laws were not always proposed in the Senate. In 2009, Senator Sanders introduced the American Health Security Act of 2009, which was the first single-payer bill in the Senate since the 1990s, when a similar law was proposed by Senator Paul Wellstone. It was more similar to HR 1200, The American Health Security Act of 2009, than HR 676.  115th Congress (2017)  On 13 September 2017, in the aftermath of his 2016 presidential campaign in which single-payer healthcare was among the core tenets of his platform, Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced the Medicare For All Act of 2017 (S. 1804), a parallel bill to the United States National Health Care Act (H.R. 676) that was introduced by Rep. John Conyers in the House. Notably, Sanders had introduced a similar version of the bill in 2013, but no other senators co-sponsored it. Conversely, Sanders's 2017 version attracted 16 Democratic cosponsors besides himself: * Sen. Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin * Sen. Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut * Sen. Cory Booker from New Jersey * Sen. Al Franken from Minnesota * Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand from New York * Sen. Kamala Harris from California * Sen. Martin Heinrich from New Mexico * Sen. Mazie Hirono from Hawaii * Sen. Patrick Leahy from Vermont * Sen. Ed Markey from Massachusetts * Sen. Jeff Merkley from Oregon * Sen. Brian Schatz from Hawaii * Sen. Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire * Sen. Tom Udall from New Mexico * Sen. Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts * Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island Sanders explained rationale for the bill in terms of per-capita healthcare costs in the U.S. compared to other developed countries: He argues that the universal healthcare systems in other countries are responsible for their decreased costs and urges that the United States follow suit.  116th Congress  In 2019 Bernie Sanders introduced the Medicare for All Act of 2019 as S. 1129. According to Robert Moffit, per section 303 of the legislation, if any doctor provides any private service outside of the government plan, the doctor may not bill the government for any service for any reason for one year. Sanders proposed new taxes to pay for Medicare for All, including progressive taxes on workers. The House version is HR 1384, sponsored by Representative Jayapal with 112 consponsors.

Comprising five distinct summits, Mount Lyell reaches a height of . The mountain was named by James Hector in 1858 in recognition of the Scottish geologist, Sir Charles Lyell. Geography Mount Lyell is located on the Great Divide, which forms the BC-Alberta boundary in this area, in Banff National Park. Collectively, the five peaks, and the Mt. Lyell massif itself, are commonly referred to as 'the Lyells'. The mountain is the highest in the Lyell Group, a subrange of the Central Icefields in the Canadian Rockies. Mt. Lyell and its 5 subpeaks: L1-L5 In 1972, five distinct peaks on Mt. Lyell (formerly referred to as only Lyell 1 through 5 or L1 through L5), were named after Swiss mountain guides who settled in Golden, British Columbia in 1912. Running south to north along the interprovincial boundary, these peaks are: Christian Peak (L5), Walter Peak (L4), and Ernest Peak (L3), named after Christian H√§ssler, Walter Feuz and Ernest Feuz. Located entirely in Alberta are Edward Peak (L2) and Rudolph Peak (L1), named after Edward Feuz Jr. and Rudolph Aemmer. Mount Lyell marks the limit between the South Saskatchewan and Columbia watersheds. Geology Mount Lyell is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The Lyell Formation is named after Mount Lyell. Geology for all five subpeaks is identical due to their proximity to the central peak (maximum distance: ). Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Lyell is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

Based on Sakyo Komatsu's 1964 novel, the film stars an international ensemble cast featuring Masao Kusakari, Sonny Chiba, George Kennedy, Robert Vaughn, Chuck Connors, Olivia Hussey, Edward James Olmos, Glenn Ford, and Henry Silva. On its release, the film was the most expensive Japanese film ever made. Plot In 1982, a shady transaction is occurring between an East German scientist, Dr. Krause, and a group of Americans involving a substance known as MM88. MM88 is a deadly virus, created accidentally by an American geneticist, that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. The Americans recover the virus sample, which was stolen from a lab in the US the year before, but the virus is accidentally released after the plane transporting it crashes, creating a pandemic initially known as the \\"Italian Flu\\". Within seven months, virtually all the world's population has died off. However, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius, and the polar winter has spared the 855 men and eight women stationed in Antarctica. The British nuclear submarine HMS Nereid joins the scientists after sinking a Soviet submarine whose infected crew attempts to make landfall near Palmer Station. Several years later, as the group is beginning to repopulate their new home, it is discovered that an earthquake will activate the Automated Reaction System (ARS) and launch the United States nuclear arsenal. The Soviets have their own version of the ARS that will fire off their weapons in return, including one targeting Palmer Station. After all of the women and children and several hundred of the men are sent to safety aboard an icebreaker, Yoshizumi and Major Carter embark aboard the Nereid on a mission to shut down the ARS, protected from MM88 by an experimental vaccine. The submarine arrives at Washington, D.C., and Yoshizumi and Carter make a rush for the ARS command bunker. However, they reach the room too late, and all but those aboard the icebreaker perish in the nuclear exchange. Over the course of years Yoshizumi walks back towards Antarctica. Upon reaching Tierra del Fuego in 1988,Dr. Latour: We've all had injections of my vaccine against the virus, which is why we have survived the last four years. (English, Kadokawa Shoten, 1980) he finds some of the survivors from the icebreaker, immunized by a since-developed vaccine. They embrace, and Yoshizumi declares \\"Life is wonderful.\\" Cast * Masao Kusakari as Dr. Sh√ªz√¥ Yoshizumi * Tsunehiko Watase as Yasuo Tatsuno * Sonny Chiba as Dr. Yamauchi * Kensaku Morita as Ry√ªji Sanazawa * Toshiyuki Nagashima as Akimasa Matsuo * Glenn Ford as President Richardson * George Kennedy as Admiral Conway * Robert Vaughn as Senator Barkley * Chuck Connors as Captain McCloud * Bo Svenson as Major Carter * Olivia Hussey as Marit * Henry Silva as General Garland * Isao Natsuyagi as Commander Nakanishi * Stephanie Faulkner as Sarah Baker * Stuart Gillard as Dr. Edward Meyer * Cec Linder as Dr. Latour * George Touliatos as Colonel Rankin * Chris Wiggins as Dr. Borodinov * Edward James Olmos as Captain Lopez * Colin Fox as Agent Z * Ken Pogue as Dr. Krause * Alberta Watson as Litha Background and production In the 1970s, producer Haruki Kadokawa formed the Kadokawa Production Company. Its releases included Kon Ichikawa's The Inugamis and Junya Sato's Proof of the Man, with the latter having American cast members such as George Kennedy. Kadokawa began to develop films that were often based on literary properties held by Kadokawa's publishing arm. The domestic box-office for these films was large, which led to Kadokawa putting 2 million yen into the film Virus, making it the most expensive film in Japanese history on its release. The film was shot on location in Tokyo and various locations throughout Canada, including Kleinburg, Ottawa, and Halifax. The production was heavily supported by the Chilean Navy, who lent the submarine Simpson (SS-21) for use as a filming location. Submarine interiors were filmed on-board HMCS Okanagan (S74), an Oberon-class vessel that served in the Canadian Forces. During filming, a Swedish cruiser used to transport crew was heavily damaged by a coral reef off the Chilean coast, and had to be rescued by the Navy. Release Virus was released theatrically in Japan on 28 June 1980 where it was distributed by Toho. The American version of the film was shown for review at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1980 as a \\"work-in-progress\\" print. The non-English language footage was dubbed into English for this release and it ran at 155 minutes. It was initially released to home video in the United States with a 108-minute run-time and was presented on television with a 93-minute running time. The original Japanese-language cut was released to home video in 2006 with English subtitles.

Widdlesworth was formed in November 2003 by Ryland Raus as an acoustic solo project. Soon he added drummer Jesse Trillet and bassist Ricky Dyson to the line up to make Widdlesworth a full band. They began practicing regularly at this time though they only played a few shows since Widdlesworth was still viewed as more or less a side project as Ryland put most his time and effort into playing and practicing with the street punk band My Son Cid. As the summer of 2004 rolled to an end Ryland parted ways with My Son Cid and focused all his energy on Widdlesworth. It was at this time they added a second guitarist, Tony Livigni and a new drummer, Chris Kingsland. In October 2004, the newly formed Widdlesworth took the stage for the first time. Since then they have played over 80 shows throughout Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania building a name for themselves locally.(having shared the stage with bands such as Relient K, Fear Before the March of Flames, Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Far-Less, John Reuben, Family Force Five, The Rocket Summer, Anathallo, and The Myriad to name a few) In November 2005, Widdlesworth headed into the studio to record. The results of these sessions, which lasted several months, was Widdlesworth's debut album \\"I Am Not A Theory\\". The album was released independently on March 26, 2006 by way of a release party to a near sell out crowd at Akron, Ohio's Lime Spider. By this time, Ryland had set aside playing guitar live to focus more on vocals. Chris Solyntjes was brought in January 2006 to pick up the live guitar parts. On August 15, 2006 the band announced that they were breaking up due to the members wanting to pursue different things with their lives. Ryland and Chris K. have both continued to pursue music. Ryland Raus is currently the lead vocalist for the Christian metalcore band Inhale Exhale on Solid State Records.

This prehistoric archaeological site is important in Korean prehistory because it represents solid evidence that simple chiefdoms formed in as early as the Middle Mumun, some 950 years before the first state-level societies formed in Korea. The settlement is dated by pottery, pit-house types, and an AMS radiocarbon date to the Late Middle Mumun Pottery Period (c. 700‚Äì550 BC).GARI (Gyeongnam Archaeological Research Institute) 2003 Sacheon Igeum-dong Yujeok [The Igeum- dong Site, Sacheon]. GARI, Jinju. Test excavations were conducted in 1997, and wide-scope horizontal excavations took place in 1998 and 1999. The site contains a megalithic cemetery with 63 burials, some of them with artifacts of high-status, 25 raised-floor buildings, including the two largest raised-floor buildings in Korean prehistory, 5 ditches, 1 palisade, and 27 pit-houses. The intra-site patterns show that the site is divided up into at least three ‚Äòzones‚Äô: 1) mortuary, (2) feasting-meeting, and (3) residential.NRICH (National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage Korea) 2004 Igeum-dong Yujeok. Hanguk Gogohak Jeonmun Sajeon: Cheongdonggisidae Pyeon [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology: Bronze Age]. NRICH, Greater Daejeon, pp. 456‚Äì458. . Megalithic cemetery The megalithic cemetery is notable for a number of high-status burials and an interconnected series of low ‚Äòpavement‚Äô features made of rounded river cobbles that link the burials together. Individual megalithic burials were constructed with small cobble pavements in the vicinity of the grave, but through time a long line of burials became interconnected through these pavements. The pavement features themselves are thought to have functioned as ritual altars on which was placed fine red- burnished pottery and other offerings. The overall length of the excavated burials in the long, strung-out cemetery is some hundreds of metres and must have formed through numerous individual funerary events that took place over a number of generations. Some of the artifacts excavated from the cemetery include two rare Liaoning-style bronze daggers (Burial Nos. C-10 and D-4). Other burials yielded hundreds of large tubular greenstone ornaments, groundstone daggers, and finely made red-burnished pottery.Bale, Martin T. and Min-jung Ko 2006 Craft Production and Social Change in Mumun Pottery Period. Asian Perspectives 45 (2):159‚Äì187. Raised-floor buildings: meeting places or dwellings of chiefs? The cemetery lies beside two long raised-floor buildings, Nos. 60 and 61. These buildings were placed on a series of large wooden footings, the largest of which approached 2 m in diameter. Building 60 was 29 m in length and 174 m¬≤ in area, and No. 61 was 26 m in length in 130 m¬≤ in area. Based on these large dimensions, the excavators have illustrated Nos. 60 and 61 as being built up high, not unlike the reconstructions of raised- floor buildings at the Yayoi period Yoshinogari site in Saga, Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan. Pottery was excavated in and around the two large raised-floor buildings at Igeum-dong, indicating that they were likely used for feasts and meetings. Alternatively, the buildings could also be the dwellings of Igeum-dong's chief and/or members of the local elite group. The two large raised-floor buildings separate the megalithic cemetery from the residential area at Igeum-dong. The residential area is composed of pit-houses in the Late Middle Mumun style, otherwise known as Songguk-ri-style. Additionally, raised-floor buildings of varying sizes and plans are found in this area. The largest pit-houses and raised-floor buildings are located closest to Nos. 60 and 61, and successively smaller pit-houses are found the further one is from the two largest raised- floor buildings. Igeum-dong is unique among Mumun pottery period sites in that 1) bronze objects come from the megalithic cemetery, (2) there are two large raised-floor buildings, and (3) a highly organized intra-site settlement plan. Some archaeologists propose that Igeum-dong was the central settlement of a small chiefdom. Other bronze artifact-bearing major Late Middle Mumun cemeteries such as Deokcheon-ri (Korean: ÎçïÏ≤úÎ¶¨), Jeongyang-ri (Ï†ÅÎüâÎ¶¨), Jindong-ri (ÏßÑÎèôÎ¶¨), and Yulha-ri (Ïú®ÌïòÎ¶¨) are found at a number of locations in a similar environmental location not far from the sea. The personages represented by the high-status burials at Igeum-dong may have been the masters of the large raised-floor buildings and they became prominent by being highly involved in economic trade between south-coastal Korea, the interior of South Gyeongsang Province, and northern Kyushu in Japan.

History The first structure used for court purposes in Appanoose County was also used as a storeroom and a blacksmith's shop. The first true courthouse was a structure built in 1848 for $160 in Centerville. After the county outgrew this building, court sessions were held in the Methodist and Presbyterian churches while another courthouse was built. It was a two-story, brick building built for $23,000. In 1891 it was declared unsafe and condemned. The architects for the present courthouse was the Des Moines architectural firm Smith and Gage. with In February 1903 the contract, exclusive of heating and plumbing, was awarded to William Peatman, the amount of his bid being $69,900. The cornerstone was laid on May 21, 1903. The courthouse was dedicated on September 12, 1904, and rededicated in a festive ceremony on September 12, 2004. Architecture The two-story rusticated limestone structure is built on a high foundation. Its eclectic appearance combines large polygonal bays and rock-faced stone from the medieval revivals with classical details found in the pediments and the pilastered main entrance. A large round arch window is located over the main entrance, and the building is capped with a two-stage central clock tower.

The duo comprised Marvin Phillips (born October 23, 1931) and Emory \\"Johnny\\" Perry (born March 1, 1928), who recorded the early doo-wop single, \\"Cherry Pie\\". Career Phillips was born in Guthrie, Oklahoma, United States and Perry in Sherman, Texas, but their impact in the music industry occurred in Los Angeles in 1954. The pair had become acquainted in 1949 when they were saxophonists for The Richard Lewis Band. Prior to teaming up with Perry, Phillips worked with several other artists who performed under the name \\"Johnny.\\" The first was Carl Green, and later Johnny Starks. Phillips also paired with the R&B; singer Jesse Belvin. They charted with \\"Dream Girl\\" b/w \\"Daddy Loves Baby\\" in late 1952. \\"Dream Girl\\" received good airplay and sales in California, but Belvin had opportunities elsewhere and left Phillips to pursue a solo career. Later, Marvin \\"Rip\\" Spencer, Phillips' nephew, would perform under the Marvin and Johnny name. Phillips then teamed up with Carl \\"Johnny\\" Green, who had been working as a duo recording as Johnny & Mack for Deluxe Records. This incarnation of the duo recorded \\"Baby Doll\\" b/w \\"I'm Not Your Fool\\" for Specialty Records in the summer of 1953. At the same time, Phillips recorded the single \\"Sweetheart Darling\\" for Swingtime Records. The next outing for the duo was \\"Jo Jo\\" b/w \\"How Long She Been Gone\\" in early 1954. \\"School of Love\\" b/w \\"Boy Loves Girl\\" was their next release. On July 13, 1954, the pair signed with the Bihari brothers and moved to the Modern Records label. At Modern, they recorded \\"Tick Tock\\" and \\"Cherry Pie.\\" The record was a big seller, and both sides received airplay. As was commonplace among early doo-wop, part of its popularity rested with the double-entendre lyric. After \\"Cherry Pie\\", the pair performed on shows and revues that traveled around the West Coast of the United States. They released \\"Day In-Day Out\\" b/w \\"Flip\\", then \\"Kiss Me\\" b/w \\"Sugar,\\" and \\"Little Honey\\" b/w \\"Honey Girl\\". None of these recordings had the commercial impact of \\"Cherry Pie.\\" Aside from their doo-wop lineage, Marvin & Johnny were significant figures in the transition from West Coast jump blues to R&B.; In 1955, Marvin & Johnny continued to do personal appearances and recorded singles. However, their appeal continued to be based on \\"Cherry Pie.\\" They went their separate ways that year, but Marvin did not let the Marvin & Johnny name die. Jesse Belvin had received his discharge from the U.S. Army by this time and he rejoined Phillips. In July 1956, Phillips and Belvin broke up again as Phillips began a solo career billed as Long Tall Marvin. Aladdin Records released \\"My Dear My Darling\\" in September 1956 and credited it to Marvin & Johnny. In May 1958, an old Marvin & Johnny recording of \\"Yak Yak\\" b/w \\"Pretty Eyes\\" was released on Aladdin. George Carlin performed \\"Cherry Pie\\" following a monologue on the Gladys Knight & The Pips variety show in 1975, backed by the Pips, and again on The Arsenio Hall Show on 30 November 1989.

This audio drama was produced by Big Finish Productions; the first of two 50-minute parts was broadcast on BBC 7 on 31 December 2006, and the second was aired on 7 January 2007. It is the first original Doctor Who drama produced for BBC 7, and stars Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor and Sheridan Smith as new companion Lucie Miller. Lucie, described as a \\"brash northern lass\\", is an unwilling passenger in the TARDIS as she has been placed with the Doctor as part of a \\"Time Lord witness protection programme\\". It is the first in a series of six stories commissioned by BBC 7 from Big Finish. The story is set on a human colony named Red Rocket Rising, and features the Daleks. Plot Part 1 To the Doctor's puzzlement and consternation, Lucie Miller appears in the TARDIS; he attempts to return her to the North of England in 2006, but finds that a temporal shield prevents him from landing there. Instead, the two find themselves on the human colony world Red Rocket Rising, which has suffered an asteroid strike and the consequent impact winter. The survivors include the colony's acting president, Eileen Klint, disgraced scientist Asha Gryvern and the apparently paranoid Tom Cardwell. Klint receives a message from a Dalek fleet offering rescue to the colony's citizens, and accepts the offer, believing the Daleks to be benevolent. Lucie reveals that the Time Lords have placed her in the Doctor's care because of something she'd seen, although she doesn't know what it is. Asha, apparently the assistant to one Professor Martez, is in reality Martez himself, who had combined dead and living humans with technology salvaged from a crashed Dalek ship in an effort to ensure survival; Martez has created a new race of Daleks. When the true Daleks land, they welcome the survivors onto their ship, and demand that Klint turn the Doctor over to them. Meanwhile, Martez orders his Daleks to open fire on the Doctor. Part 2 The Doctor tricks Martez's Daleks and escapes. Martez has summoned the Daleks for assistance with his own Dalek creations, but the true Daleks see Martez's Daleks as a threat to the purity of the Dalek race, and plan to destroy them. The Doctor allies himself temporarily with the true Daleks in order to destroy Martez's Daleks, but then works with Tom Cardwell to eliminate both Dalek groups. The Daleks reveal that they caused the asteroid strike on Red Rocket Rising, in a failed attempt to eliminate Martez's creations; they also destroyed the exodus ships carrying refugees from the disaster. Martez's Daleks, which are being birthed at a rapid rate, initially have an advantage over the true Daleks, who are weakened from another conflict. The Doctor eventually convinces Martez that a Dalek- dominated world will know only hatred, war and death. Martez, whose stolen body is breaking down, halts the birthing process; in return, his creations kill him. Eventually, the two groups of Daleks (aided by Cardwell's resistance) destroy each other. The humans are left to pick up the pieces, and Klint announces that a new offer of rescue has been received from the inhabitants of a planet whose name begins \\"Tel-\\". Lucie considers staying with the survivors on Red Rocket Rising, but the Doctor discovers that the Time Lords will not let him leave the planet without her. And elsewhere, a woman calling herself the Headhunter accepts a commission from one Mr. Hulbert, promising him that she will find Lucie Miller anywhere in space and time...

However this story was broadcast more than a year before that story. *At the end of the play, Klint declares that help is coming once more; she names their new saviours' home planet, but only the first part of the name, \\"Tel-\\", is heard before the signal cuts off. This implies the planet is Telos, and that Red Rocket Rising will soon be invaded by Cybermen. *The Headhunter reappears in several of the following Eighth Doctor stories. She finally catches Lucie at the end of No More Lies. *The Daleks talk about putting the Doctor on trial to deceive the inhabitants of Red Rocket Rising. This may refer to the TV movie in which the Daleks, out of the norm, put the Master on trial, listening to his plea, and explains why this had happened. *Lucie meets the Daleks again in her last story, Lucie Miller / To the Death. Notes *This is the first of a run of episodes set before the ongoing revival TV series and after the 1996 television movie. The series may be set some time after the previous and ongoing Big Finish run of stories featuring McGann and India Fisher. The Radio Times indicated that this series was the run up to Christopher Eccleston's subsequent incarnation of the Time Lord. However, according to the Beyond the Vortex episode broadcast after Human Resources part 2, Big Finish will not be doing this. This is the first time the BBC has itself supported two separate ongoing productions featuring different Doctors (although Big Finish is, itself, not part of the BBC; BBC7 is). The end of this series is the 2011 release To the Death. *Part 1 was broadcast on BBC 7 less than a week after The Runaway Bride aired on BBC One, on Christmas Day; coincidentally, both stories open with the Doctor startled by the sudden, unexpected appearance of a strange woman in the TARDIS console room. *Lucie asking the Doctor if his hair is real is a reference to the wig that Paul McGann wore as the Doctor in the TV movie.

It is written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Jacen Burrows. The series consists of three issues and was published from July through October of 2001. The general theme and tone of the series was continued in Bad Signal. Overview Unlike most comic books, Bad World is a work of nonfiction and does not contain characters, plots, or a recurring storyline. Instead, the writing in each issue is a series of observations by Ellis on stories which are incredibly bizarre, but true. The series repeatedly deals with subjects such as serial killers, conspiracy theorists, UFO cultists, and religious fanatics, bizarre acts such as cannibalism, necrophilia, and bestiality, and unusual beliefs such as urine therapy, inedia, and Flat Earthers. Burrows' art provides a background for Ellis' observations. Though drawn in a realistic style, the art often stylizes or parodies the material being discussed; for example, on a page about a woman who claims that she and her children are alien/human hybrids, Burrows draws a woman sitting in a rocking chair and holding two infant Greys.

Monqui territory included about of coast along the Gulf of California and extended a few kilometers inland to where the Cochimi people lived. Probably first encountered by explorers traveling up the Gulf of California during the sixteenth century, the Monqui were subjected to some of the peninsula's earliest intensive Jesuit missionary efforts during the late seventeenth century. The Tyrolean Jesuit Eusebio Francisco Kino, together with Admiral Isidoro de Atondo y Antillon, unsuccessfully attempted to establish Misi√≥n San Bruno on the northern margin of Monqui territory in 1684-1685.Bolton 1936 The first permanent mission and settlement in Baja California was founded in Monqui territory at Loreto in 1697 by Juan Mar√≠a de Salvatierra. In contrast to many of their Jesuit colleagues, Kino and Salvatierra included relatively few notes on native ethnography in their letters and reports. Most of what is known about the aboriginal culture of the Monqui comes from incidental comments in explorers' accounts and at second hand in the works of the Jesuit historian Miguel Venegas (1757, 1979). Culture Kino, with years of experience on the frontier, said that the Indians of Baja California had the most difficult existence of any he had seen. The Jesuit missionaries early perceived that the nomadic Monqui could be attracted to the missions and Christianity by the promise of food, often exchanged for work. The Monqui and other Baja Californian Indians were hunter- gatherers who harvested a wide range of natural resources from the shores of the Gulf, as well as in interior valleys and the Sierra de la Giganta. The land could support less that one person per square kilometer. Their material culture was sparse, based on what they could carry with them on their endless peregrinations in search of food. The Monqui \\"had no agriculture, no fixed places of residence, no permanent or portable shelters, and little clothing -- none on men, and only grass skirts on women. They had no boats, no pottery, and no domestic animals -- not even the dog....many of them change their sleeping quarters more than a hundred times a year.\\"Crosby, Harry W. (1994), Antigua California, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, p. 27-29 Their social organization was based on autonomous local communities (rancherias) that sometimes were hostile to each other. Unappreciated by the Spanish, however, the Monqui and their neighbors had egalitarian societies and were adept at using local resources to produce basketry, personal decorations, and weapons and utensils of wood. The people of Baja California made pigments by powdering rocks and created thousands of large, elaborate, and often abstract rock paintings, some of which are preserved in a World Heritage Site of UNESCO in the San Francisco Mountains north of Monqui territoryCrosby, pp. 27-28 Traditional Monqui culture had probably disappeared before the end of the eighteenth century, under the impacts of mission acculturation and the decimation caused by Old World epidemic diseases. Language Of the Monqui language only 14 place names survive and the characteristics and relationships of Monqui to other languages cannot be determined with any precision.Laylander, Don. (1997), \\"The linguistic prehistory of Baja California\\". In Contributions to the Linguistic Prehistory of Central and Baja California, edited by Gary S. Breschini and Trudy Haversat, Salinas, California: Coyote Press, pp. 79-80 William C. Massey (1949) believed that the Monqui spoke a Cochim√≠ language or dialect. Cochimi is remotely related to the Yuman languages spoken in the northern part of the Baja California peninsula. A recent reassessment of the historical evidence suggests instead that the Monqui language was distinctive and non-Cochim√≠, possibly related to that of the Guaycura to the south. The Didiu people who lived on the coast north of Loreto may have been Monqui or, alternatively Cochimi. The Baja California peninsula is a geographic cul-de-sac and the languages in the southernmost part of the peninsula (Pericu, Guaycura and, possibly, Monqui) have no known relatives. Some linguists have speculated that these people and languages date back thousands of years and that they may be the direct descendants of the earliest inhabitants in the Americas. This speculation is reinforced by their physical characteristic of dolichocephalic crania (longheadedness) which is unusual among present-day American Indians.Golla, Victor (2011), California Indian Languages, Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 125, 239-240 Population and decline In the small and austere area they occupied the Monqui probably never numbered more than a few hundred persons. The Jesuits recorded the name of eight Monqui rancheries but by the end of 1698, nearly all the Monqui, totaling about 400 persons, lived near the Loreto Mission. Thereafter, their numbers decreased rapidly because of a heavy death toll from European diseases. By 1733, the Indian, mostly Monqui, population of Loreto was only 134. By 1770 the few remaining Monqui were submerged in a population of Loreto that consisted mostly of Spanish, people of mixed races (mestizos), and Christian Indians imported from the mainland or from other parts of Baja California.

Reproductive synchrony‚Äîsometimes termed \\"ovulatory synchrony\\"‚Äîmay manifest itself as \\"breeding seasonality\\". Where females undergo regular menstruation, \\"menstrual synchrony\\" is another possible term. Figure a. Females competing for good genes should avoid ovulatory synchrony. Moving from one female to the next, a single dominant male under these conditions can exercise a monopoly. Key: Circle = female. Pointer = ovulation. Triangle = male. Figure b. Females in need of male time and energy should synchronise their cycles, preventing any one male from monopolising access. Reproduction is said to be synchronised when fertile matings across a population are temporarily clustered, resulting in multiple conceptions (and consequent births) within a restricted time window. In marine and other aquatic contexts, the phenomenon may be referred to as mass spawning. Mass spawning has been observed and recorded in a large number of phyla, including in coral communities within the Great Barrier Reef. In primates, reproductive synchrony usually takes the form of conception and birth seasonality.Brockman, D. K. and C. P. Van Schaik, 2005. Seasonality and reproductive function. In D. K. Brockman and C. P. van Schaik (eds), Seasonality in Primates. Studies of living and extinct human and non-human primates. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 269-305. The regulatory \\"clock\\", in this case, is the sun's position in relation to the tilt of the earth. In nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates‚Äîfor example, owl monkeys‚Äîthe periodicity of the moon may also come into play.Nash, L. T. 2007. Moonlight and behavior in nocturnal and cathemeral primates, especially Lepilemur leucopus: Illuminating possible anti-predator efforts. In S.L. Gursky and K.A.I. Nekaris (eds), Primate Anti- Predator Strategies. New York: Springer, pp. 173-205. Synchrony in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of \\"paternity skew\\"‚Äîdefined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males. The greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony‚Äîthe greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously‚Äîthe harder it is for any dominant male to succeed in monopolising a harem all to himself. This is simply because, by attending to any one fertile female, the male unavoidably leaves the others at liberty to mate with his rivals. The outcome is to distribute paternity more widely across the total male population, reducing paternity skew (figures a, b). Reproductive synchrony can never be perfect. On the other hand, theoretical models predict that group-living species will tend to synchronise wherever females can benefit by maximising the number of males offered chances of paternity, minimising reproductive skew. For example, the cichlid fish V. moorii spawns in the days leading up to each full moon (lunar synchrony), and broods often exhibit multiple paternity. The same models predict that female primates, including evolving humans, will tend to synchronise wherever fitness benefits can be gained by securing access to multiple males. Conversely, group-living females who need to restrict paternity to a single dominant harem-holder should assist him by avoiding synchrony.Turke, P. W. 1988. Concealed ovulation, menstrual synchrony and paternal investment. In E. Filsinger (ed.), Biosocial Perspectives on the Family. Newbury Park, CA: Sage, pp. 119-136. In the human case, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens would have done best by resisting attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs a partner who will get her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner.Power, C. and L. C. Aiello 1997. Female proto-symbolic strategies. In L. D. Hager (ed.), Women in Human Evolution. New York and London: Routledge, pp. 153-171. To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted‚Äîand the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can be included in the breeding system and persuaded to invest effort‚Äîthe better. Hence scientists would expect reproductive synchrony‚Äîwhether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two‚Äîto be central to evolving human strategies of reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and culminating in the predominantly monogamous egalitarian norms illustrated by extant hunter-gatherers. Divergent climate regimes differentiating Neanderthal reproductive strategies from those of modern Homo sapiens have recently been analysed in these terms.

He was the son of Mummolin, duke of Soissons, and served the kings Chilperic I and Childebert II. Bodegisel was dux of Provence. He was celebrated in song by the contemporary poet Venantius Fortunatus, who praised the education and eloquence he displayed as rector of Marseilles under Sigebert I, a position Bodegisel held until about 565. In 584, Bodegisel accompanied Rigunth, the daughter of Chilperic I, to Spain for her marriage to Reccared, the son of the Visigothic king Liuvigild, although the marriage never took place. After his return, he was sent on an embassy to Constantinople (capital of the Byzantine Empire) on behalf of Childebert II. Bodegisel stopped at Carthage on the return trip, and he was murdered there, being torn to pieces by a mob. A.C. Murray, paraphrasing Gregory, says he was struck with a sword as he stepped outside their lodging when a crowd gathered in response to the murder of a merchant committed by one of their retainers.Murray, Alexander Callander. Gregory of Tours: The Merovingians, University of Toronto Press, 2005, The bishop and contemporary historian Gregory of Tours records that Bodegisel was able to accomplish the unusual feat of passing on his estate to his heirs undiminished. According to Hans-Walter Herrmann and Ulrich Nonn, confusion between Bodegisel and a later duke named Bobo is responsible for the semi- legendary duke Boggis who appears in sources from the ninth century on. Bobo was a member of an illustrious Austrasian family and a nephew of the deacon Adalgisel Grimo (died 634), but where his dukedom was located is unknown. According to the thirteenth-century Vita sanctae Odae viduae, Saint Chrodoara was married to a certain duke Boggis and became a nun after his death. According to Herrmann and Nonn, Chrodoara may have been the wife of Bodegisel. Writing in the eleventh century, Sigebert of Gembloux named Boggis a duke of Aquitaine and misplaces his life towards 711. The Vita Landberti episcopi Traiectensis, a life of Bishop Lambert of Maastricht, refers to \\"Chrodoara ... widow of the recently deceased Boggis, duke of Aquitaine\\" as a \\"friend\\" of Lambert's.(Oda ... Bohggis Aquitanorum ducis recens defuncti vidua) and (amita) in Vita Landberti episcopi Traiectensis auctore Nicolao, MGH, Scriptores rerum Merovingicarum, VI, p. 415 . A spurious charter of king Charles the Bald dated 30 January 845 and the Charte d'Alaon, a modern fabrication, give Bodegisel/Boggis a genealogy that makes him a son of king Charibert II and gives him a brother named Bertrand who succeeded him.

He was convicted of kidnapping and raping Elizabeth Shoaf, a 14-year- old girl from Lugoff, South Carolina, in 2006, holding her captive in an underground bunker. Filyaw had built the bunker to elude police who were seeking him for the rape of Amberly Rose Shook. A former girlfriend of Filyaw's made an anonymous call to Kershaw County's Department of Social Services that alerted the police to him. Filyaw's girlfriend was also arrested on charges of aiding and abetting the abduction. Kidnapping The victim, Elizabeth Shoaf, was kidnapped after she got off her school bus on September 6, 2006. Filyaw gained her trust by posing as a police officer. He walked her around in the woods until she became disoriented and then marched her to a hand-dug 15-foot bunker near his trailer home, located within a mile of her own home. Once inside, he stripped her naked, restrained her with chains, and raped her several times a day over the duration of her 10-day captivity. Police initially interpreted her disappearance as a runaway, and did not launch an Amber alert. Shoaf's poise and calm while she was held captive was considered remarkable by people involved with missing children cases. \\"Not only was she very brave, she was also very smart and did several things that greatly improved her chances of survival,\\" said Captain David Thomley of the Kershaw County Sheriff‚Äôs Department. * While being led into the woods, she dropped her shoes in the hope that it would provide a clue for someone who was searching for her. * Despite receiving ongoing death threats and having explosives hung around her neck, she \\"would talk with him about things that interested him, which in his eyes, made her a person, not just a captive. She began to gain his trust.\\" * After continuing to gain his trust, she was allowed out of the bunker, and would \\"pull out strands of her hair [and] lay them on branches hoping search dogs might pick up her scent.\\" After 10 days in captivity, the victim convinced Filyaw to let her borrow his cellular phone to play games, but she had an entirely different use in mind. Once he fell asleep, she texted her mother and friends, who contacted the police. Before the police could triangulate the phone number, Sheriff Steve McCaskill thought that the text was a hoax. The former girlfriend who made the call to Kershaw County's Department of Social Services passed on Filyaw's cell phone number to the police. The authorities then began to triangulate the bunker's position through local cell phone towers. Officer Dave Thomley did not know that Elizabeth Shoaf was underground in a bunker until Filyaw's former girlfriend showed them the first bunker he built. Thomley initially thought that it was a trash pit. Filyaw learned that he was being pursued when he watched the news on a battery-powered television in the bunker. He asked Shoaf for advice and she suggested he ought to run away to avoid capture. He left and the next morning Shoaf left the bunker and called for help until she was found by a rescue team. Filyaw equipped the entrance of the bunker with a booby-trap, according to police. Arrest Filyaw was five miles from his house, carrying a taser, pellet gun, and knife, when he was arrested. He was charged with kidnapping, possession of an incendiary device (a flare gun), and impersonating a police officer, with other charges pending. Trial and sentencing Filyaw pleaded guilty to all counts just before the start of the trial. The victim, Shoaf, was too emotional to testify, but a prepared statement was read by her attorney and she later made a public statement. Vinson Filyaw was sentenced to 421 years in prison without possibility of parole on September 19, 2007, by Circuit Judge G. Thomas Cooper, given the maximum penalty under South Carolina law. He is incarcerated at the Maximum Security Unit at Kirkland Correctional Institution. Shoaf later made several media appearances, including a 2008 episode of the Today show, on which Meredith Vieira did a profile of Shoaf and her family, commenting on her calmness throughout such a horrific event. The story aired on Dateline NBC on March 7, 2008. Filyaw's interaction with Shoaf was also explored on the \\"Underground Terror\\" episode of Investigation Discovery's Surviving Evil series, hosted by fellow crime survivor Charisma Carpenter, on September 9, 2013. The entire ordeal was dramatized in the Lifetime movie Girl in the Bunker, premiering on May 28, 2018. Sources External links *Teen Rescued After Sending Text Message.

The score features more instances of electronic music, which Arnold included to \\"make the thing a little more contemporary\\". To add an ethnic flavor to tracks that conveyed the film's Turkey and Central Asia setting, Arnold brought in percussionist Pete Lockett, qanun player Abdullah Chhadeh, and singer Natacha Atlas. Arnold broke tradition by not ending the film with a new song or a reprise of the opening theme. Originally, Arnold intended to use the song \\"Only Myself to Blame\\", written by David Arnold & Don Black and sung by Scott Walker and inspired by the failed romance between Bond and Elektra King, who turns out to be a villain. However, director Michael Apted \\"felt it was too much of a downer for the end of the movie\\" and Arnold replaced it with a techno remix of the \\"James Bond Theme\\". \\"Only Myself to Blame\\", is the nineteenth and final track on the album. The soundtrack was recorded across six days in September 1999 by an 83-piece orchestra conducted by Arnold collaborator Nicholas Dodd. Dodd described The World Is Not Enough as his favorite Bond score. Elektra King was provided with her own theme, most prominently heard in \\"Casino,\\" \\"Elektra's Theme\\" and \\"I Never Miss.\\" Arnold added two new themes to the Bond repertoire with this score, both of which are reused in Die Another Day. The first is an action theme, performed on the upper-registers of the piano, heard during \\"Pipeline\\" and \\"Submarine.\\" The second is a romance theme, first heard in the film during the skiing sequence, but not heard here until the \\"Christmas in Turkey\\" cue, in a simple arrangement for piano.Burlingame (2012), pp.220-226 Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy also wrote a theme song for the film, but it was rejected.

Ingas leaves are pinnate, and flowers are generally white. Many of the hundreds of species are used ornamentally. Several related plants have been placed into this genus at one time, for example Yopo (Cohoba, Mopo, Nopo or Parica ‚Äì Anadenanthera peregrina ‚Äì as Inga niopo). The seeds are covered with sweet white powder. The pulp covering the seeds is lightly fibrous and sweet, and rich in minerals; it is edible in the raw state. The tree's name originates from the Tupi word in-g√° meaning \\"soaked\\", due to the fruit powder consistency. The tree usually blossoms twice a year. Within the Inga genus there are around 300 species, most of them native and growing in the Amazon forest region although some species are also found in Mexico, Greater and Lesser Antilles and other countries in South America, being an exclusively neotropical genus. The trees are usually found by river and lake edges because their seeds are carried there by floods. Fruit of an Inga-species All Inga species produce their seeds in \\"bean-like\\" pods and some can reach up to 1 m long, in general the pods are 10‚Äì30 cm long. Trees can reach up to 15 metres and they are widely used for producing shade over coffee plants. The plant benefits from well drained soil. The flowers are white with some green and the tree can produce fruits almost all year long. Inga species, most notably Inga edulis (commonly known as \\"ice-cream-bean\\" or, in Spanish, \\"guama\\", \\"guaba\\", \\"guaba de bejuco\\" or \\"paterna\\" depending on the country or region) often have edible pulp. The name derives from the fact that those of I. edulis resembles vanilla ice cream in flavour.

At that point, he began to study under Ibn Abbas, a companion of the Prophet known as the father of Qur'anic exegesis.

Mujahid ibn Jabr is said to be relied upon in terms of tafsir according to Sufyan al-Thawri. His exegesis in general followed these four principles: # That the Qur'an can be explained by other parts of the Qur'an.

Under the Agreement, these governments have agreed to apply the principles of non-discrimination, transparency, openness and accessibility with respect to their procurement opportunities and those of their municipalities and municipal organizations, school boards and publicly funded academic, health and social services entities. The Agreement covers only those tenders where the procurement value exceeds a specified amount. Currently, the thresholds require that all institutions in the MASH sector (Municipal/Academic/Social Services/Healthcare) tender for public bidding contracts worth $100,000 or more, or in the case of construction, $250,000 or more. The agreement mandates the \\"equal\\" treatment of people, goods and services anywhere in Canada.

He had his seat at Toulouse. According to the tenth-century Miracula sancti Martialis lemovicensis, Felix was \\"a noble and renowned patrician from the town of Toulouse, who had obtained authority over all the cities up to the Pyrenees and over the iniquitous people of the Wascones,\\" that is, the Basques. Felix is probably the first ruler of the Duchy of Aquitaine that evolved from the old kingdom of Charibert II in the decades following his death (632) and Dagobert I's subjection of the Basques. Although he stands at the head of the list of semi-independent rulers of Aquitaine that extends through the Middle Ages, he is described as \\"mysterious\\" and \\"obscure\\". Felix was probably a supporter of Chlothar III and his majordomo, Ebroin. His patriciate corresponds to the years when Chlothar's appointee, Erembert, was bishop of Toulouse. After Chlothar's death (673), Erembert retired and Chlothar's brother, Childeric II, took over the throne and deposed Ebroin. At this time, a certain Lupus, whom the Miracula describes as \\"coming to\\" Felix, presided over a regional synod at Bordeaux, though Felix was still in power in Aquitaine at that time. This synod was held under Childeric II, indicating continued Frankish sovereignty or suzerainty over Aquitaine and Gascony at that time, but a subsequent break with the Merovingians appears to have occurred following Childeric's death in 675. Lupus is often considered a prot√©g√© of Felix, to whom the latter delegated Gascony, and who eventually succeeded him over all Aquitaine. On the other hand, he was an opponent to Ebroin, and so may have been an enemy of Felix who usurped authority in Gascony. Later Lupus had control over southern Aquitaine and was trying to assert it in the north when he died.

Early life Born into a wealthy family in the village of Manalmedu in Thanjavur district, he was the first son of Kothandaraman and Bhagyam.  Career  Swami Rudrananda's interests spanned social reform, the congress party of India and poetry by Subramanya Bharathi. He also followed the work of Swami Vivekananda. In 1923, Mayavaram was flooded due to a heavy downpour. As a flood relief measure, Saints from Ramakrishna Mission travelled to the area. They needed a local contact person who could interact with people affected by the flood, to measure the severity of the flood. Muthukrishnan spoke Tamil, Telugu and English, so he was well suited to help. This interaction led to a growing interest in the Ramakrishna Order, which he later joined at the age of 25, a decision supported by his mother. While his father was initially apprehensive of the idea, eventually he came around to support his son, influenced by the mother's support. Kalki Krishnamurthy was his childhood friend. To Kalki, his friend Muthukrishnan was a courageous boy who supported him when other boys threatened him. Editor He worked as an editor for Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam magazine for some time. During that time, as per Swami Rudrananda's request, Kalki Krishnamurthy translated the book Our Mother Land by Swami Vivekananda into Tamil. Fiji Rudrananda was sent to Fiji by the Ramakrishna Mission in 1939, as Swami Avinashananda moved to Sri Lanka, to assist Then India Sanmarga Ikya (T.I.S.I.) Sangam in its religious and cultural activities. Swami Rudrananda consolidated and expanded the activities of T.I.S.I. Sangam based at Sangam Ashram in Nadi. Swami Rudrananda was fondly called a \\"SarkkariSami\\", as he was working for the betterment of sugar cane workers in Fiji. He implemented several measures, notably that Sangam work for all people instead of serving only south Indians. A saffron colored flag was designed for Sangam. Education and Temple constructions were considered as primary needs. Swami Rudrananda was the first to introduce multiracial and multicultural activities in Fiji to bring the ethnic groups together. He made sure that the Sangam schools and Sri Vivekananda High School were open to all ethnic groups. Swami Rudrananda also organised interfaith services. He acquired properties for Sangam including freehold land at Savusavu (130 acres) and Madhuvani, Rakiraki (1037 acres). The Sangam Sarada Printing Press was started, on 15 August 1948, to address the educational needs of the community at large. Publications like Sangam in Tamil, Pacific Review in English, Jagriti in Hindi, and Na Pacifica in Fijian were published and circulated to give voice to the Indian community. Although Rudrananda initially refused to take part in union or political activities, he worked with A. D. Patel to help found the Maha Sangh. During the 1943 strike, the government restricted his movements amid calls for his deportation to India. He remained an active member of the Federation Party. During the strike, he was sentenced to imprisonment with hard labor along with Patel. In 1951, Rudrananda attempted to amalgamate the Sangam and Ramakrishna Mission into a single organization. This was seen by some South Indians as an attempt by the mission to take over the assets of the Sangam. There was widespread protest, although the founder of the Sangam, Sadhu Kuppuswami, supported Rudrananda. A compromise was reached when the Sri Vivekananda High School was transferred to the Mission and the Sangam ran its own schools.

The route traverses through southern and central North Carolina, about of it as a concurrency with NC 24\\\\. Route description Lincolnton.|thumb|left NC 27 begins in Cleveland County near the unincorporated community of Toluca at a T-intersection with NC 10\\\\. From there it runs southeast to the city of Lincolnton. In Lincolnton, it serves as Main Street, and runs past the Lincoln County courthouse. From Lincolnton, it runs southeast again to Stanley where it follows Main Street. It enters Charlotte along Mount Holly Road, and follows several major thoroughfares through Charlotte, including Freedom Drive, Morehead Street, and Independence Boulevard. On the east side of Charlotte, it begins its long concurrency with NC 24, approximately 1/2 of its total length. The two highways leave the city along Albemarle Road and remain joined until the unincorporated community of Johnsonville. Along this segment, they pass through the cities of Midland, Locust, Albemarle, Troy, Biscoe, and Carthage. They share further concurrencies with NC 109, NC 22, and US 15\\\\. From the split with NC 24, the road runs northeast to Lillington where it follows Main Street, and leaves town as a concurrency with US 421\\\\. It passes Campbell University in Buies Creek before entering Johnston County and ending in Benson just short of I-95. NC 50 continues east of NC 27's terminus at US 301\\\\. History NC 27 is one of North Carolina's original state highways.NCRoads.com Annex: N.C. 25 to 29 Its original routing connected Charlotte to Lincolnton. It used several streets through Charlotte, but followed roughly the same route. The road was extended several times: *1923: east to Albemarle *1928: west to Toluca (current terminus) *1934: east to Carthage (using the concurrency with NC 24) *1948-50: east to Cameron *1958: east to Benson (current terminus) NC 27 has had a tumultuous history through Charlotte. It has always served as a major east-west route through the city, but it has been rerouted numerous times on different city streets as traffic patterns changed. All of the following roads have carried NC 27 at one time or another: *Rozelles Ferry Rd.

Signage along the route only appears at key intersections. Thrift‚ÄìCharlotte alternate route North Carolina Highway 27A (NC 27A) was established as a renumbering of NC 271\\\\. Starting at the former community of Thrift (located in present-day Paw Creek neighborhood), it went south from Mount Holly Road, entering Charlotte along Tuckaseegee/Thrift Roads. It then overlapped with US 29/US 74/NC 20 on Morehead Street and US 74 on McDowell Street, before reconnecting with mainline NC 27 at 7th Street. In 1936, NC 27A was replaced by mainline NC 27\\\\. Pee Dee‚ÄìWadeville alternate route North Carolina Highway 27A (NC 27A) was established when mainline NC 27 was rerouted on a more direct route between Lake Tillery and Troy, in Montgomery County.

This audio drama was produced by Big Finish Productions and was broadcast on BBC 7 on 21 January 2007. Plot The Doctor and Lucie Miller land the TARDIS next to a cliff in what appears to be ancient Greece. Two star-crossed lovers, Kalkin and Sararti, have been preparing to kill themselves nearby, but the Doctor and Lucie prevent this, and soon anachronistic helicopters surround them all. One of the soldiers who disembark, General Ares, is gravely injured in the ensuing struggle. The Doctor just about saves his life and he, Lucie, Sararti and Kalkin are taken back to a grand palace, where to their horror they witness the ailing Ares' mind being transferred into the body of another man, one of the soldiers, who has expected this and is entirely willing to so sacrifice himself to his 'destiny'. The Doctor confronts Zeus, the autocratic ruler of this strange society where guns are labelled as magic wands and the hi-tech mind-transfer device is an 'incarnation chamber'. Zeus admits that he is not really a god, and reveals that they are on a lost Earth colony planet in Lucie's distant future. Generations ago, he and his wife Hera, along with many others, some now long gone, landed here and he has gone on to create a society based upon Greek myth. He explains that he was the pilot of the original colony ship, and Kalkin is not his son, but his next-in-line clone, who has rebelled against his fate. The next clone after that, Ganymede, is by contrast committed to his cruel destiny, but is too young for a transfer. The ruling class, the remains of the original crew ‚Äì the 'gods' ‚Äì use their machine, which the Doctor insists has long been outlawed as an abomination ‚Äì to transfer their minds periodically into their clones, giving them practical immortality. Zeus has appeared welcoming, but lusts after Lucie despite insisting that he and Hera have a thousand-year-old love. He reveals himself to be a madman, and demands that the Doctor use the TARDIS to fetch parts to repair the immortality machine, as it has become worn out and they are now without space-travel capabilities. The Doctor very reluctantly agrees after Zeus threatens to hurt Lucie ‚Äì even to clone her repeatedly and torture each Lucie to death for all eternity. When Hera suffers a heart attack, her mind transfer into the unwilling Sararti fails, leaving Sararti in control of her body. Pretending all is well, she suddenly stabs Zeus, so that he requires an immediate transfer into Kalkin's body. The Doctor appears to go along with this under pressure from Ares and the loyal soldiers, but ensures that it fails. Though Lucie and Sararti at first fail to appreciate this ruse, the Doctor and the new Zeus ‚Äì Kalkin, of course ‚Äì convince them that the lovers can secretly take on his and Hera's roles. They insist that they will stop using the machine as the Doctor and Lucie take their leave. Lucie is optimistic, but the Doctor reminds her that these two are essentially younger versions of the tyrannical pair they have helped to overthrow...

Mission While the core mission of NELSAP is to \\"celebrate the history of lost ski areas in New England\\", the organization also works to document lost ski areas in other regions, such as New York and even Afghanistan. Another mission which has emerged over time is the effort to document and promote lesser-known open ski areas. A recent project has begun to \\"Adopt a Ski Area\\", in which contributors visit a lesser- known hill and write a trip report documenting their experience and the overall feel of the ski area. History NELSAP was started in October 1998 by Jeremy Davis. The site has grown over the years to list 599 closed New England ski areas and 79 outside the region (as of May 2011).Home New England Lost Ski Areas Project The project's data is collected from a variety of sources, including old brochures, ski area guides, personal stories, and recent visits.

Sources of biobased products  Some examples of agricultural resources that make up many biobased products include: soybeans, corn, kenaf, flax, jute, and numerous other types of crops that are harvested. Current applications of these agricultural resources create products such as ethanol (corn-based), soy candles, soy-based lubricants, kenaf office paper, and bioplastics to name a few.  Benefits of biobased products  The purchasing of biobased products helps many of the farmers across America who grow corn, soybeans, and other resources used by companies in the biobased industry. For example, ethanol is currently one of the leading alternative fuel sources in the U.S. In 2005 year, the Renewable Fuels Association reported produced by 81 plants. Currently for the 2006 year, there are 97 ethanol plants with 33 more in production. A majority of these plants are owned by a collective of farms across the midwest. Another key benefit of biobased products is that they are not petroleum-based. This helps alleviate the consumption of resources that harm the environment in terms of biodegrability, toxicity, and pollution.  Organizations for biobased products  The following organizations are leading the way in supporting the Biobased Industry. BioPreferred Program The program was created after the passing of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (FSRIA), when it was then known as the Federal Biobased Products Preferred Procurement Program or FB4P. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is overseeing the program. The research undertaken by the program helps implement the Farm Bill‚Äôs requirement of getting federal agencies to specifically buy biobased products. One key factor is the requirement that such products are readily available, reasonably priced, and pass the required performance standards of their non- biobased counterparts. United Soybean Board The United Soybean Board helps promote the use of soybeans farmed across America for use in consumer and industrial products. Originally created from the 1990 Farm Bill and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United Soybean Board performs research, advertising, and other functions to strengthen the soybean industry. To see the variety of products made from soybeans, a directory of products and companies is offered on their website.

It is positioned next to the Discovery Bridge. It is used by the freight trains of Norfolk Southern Railway.  History  The original Wabash Bridge, built in 1871, was the first bridge in St. Charles County. The original Wabash bridge saw multiple incidents during its lifetime. In 1870, a steel column collapsed during construction resulting in the deaths of eighteen bridge workers. In 1879, a portion of the bridge collapsed during a train crossing. Eighteen train cars fell into the river resulting in five deaths. In 1881, the bridge failed again during a train crossing resulting in freight cars falling into the river. An engineer, John Kirby, died along with thirty-one cattle contained in the freight cars. In 1884, the Montana steamboat collided with the pier of the bridge. The steamboat could not be removed and was left in the river. It lies on the St. Louis County side of the Missouri River near the site of the first Wabash Bridge and can still be seen when the river is low.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMDG40_History_of_the_Wabash_Bridge_St_Charles_Missouri In 1936, the current Wabash Bridge was built about half a mile upstream from the old bridge, and the old bridge was demolished.https://bridgehunter.com/mo/st-charles/first-wabash-rr/ In June 2013, the Missouri River rose rapidly overnight causing a crane mounted to a barge to collide into the truss structure of the bridge. The crane, subcontracted by The Walsh Group was working up river on the new I-70 Blanchette Memorial Bridge. Train traffic across the bridge was halted for the four days while the crane was against the structure. In 2016, owner operator Norfolk Southern Corporation began installing a new tie deck across the bridge with a completion date of 2020.

Early career Brenier enlisted in 1786 and gained rapid promotion during the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, becoming an aide-de-camp in 1792 and in 1793 a Chef de brigade (colonel) in the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees (Arm√©e des Pyr√©n√©es orientales). He served with distinction in various campaigns of the Revolutionary Wars, in Italy and in Holland. In 1799 he became G√©n√©ral de brigade. From 1801 to 1807 he served in administrative posts. Peninsular War At the start of the Peninsular War, Brenier was assigned to Jean Andoche Junot's army for the 1807 Invasion of Portugal. During the Battle of Vimeiro on 20 August 1808, Brenier's brigade made the opening attack against the British held ridge, but it was driven back. Later General Jean-Andoche Junot ordered Brenier to take his Brigade on a flanking manouvre, he chose to take a even longer route to avoid narrow paths, this made his men arrive late, after Jean-Baptiste Solignac's Brigade had been defeated. Brenier ordered his dragoons forward but they were driven off and the rallying British including the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot drive his brigade off with accurate volley fire, which wounded Brenier and led to him being captured by the 71st Regiment.https://www.dukeofwellington.org/post/the-battle-of- vimeiro-21-august-1808 Wounded and captured by the British, he returned to France from captivity in 1809. In 1810 he again went to Portugal, serving under Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na. After the first Siege of Almeida, Brenier became its governor and held the post during Massena's unsuccessful third French invasion of Portugal in 1810-1811.Horward, p 126 After the French army's retreat from Portugal, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington's British army blockaded Almeida. While marching to Brenier's relief, Massena failed to fight his way past Wellington in the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro. During the night of 10 May 1811 Brenier threaded his 1,400-man garrison through the lines of the 13,000-strong British investment force in the second Siege of Almeida. His engineers set explosives which demolished the fortifications after his men got away. During the pursuit he lost 360 men, but the pursuing British ran into an ambush set by some troops of Jean Reynier's II Corps and the rest of Brenier's soldiers safely reached French lines. Wellington wrote, \\"I have never been so much distressed by any military event as by the escape of even a man of them.\\"Glover, p 156 This brilliant exploit earned Brenier promotion to general of division. During the Battle of Salamanca, Brenier's 4,300-man 6th DivisionGlover, p 391 arrived inopportunely at the unfolding disaster on the left flank. Wellington's forces had just crushed the divisions of Jean Guillaume Barth√©lemy Thomi√®res and Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune when Brenier's men came up, winded from a rapid march. Still in battalion columns, the division was first swamped with fleeing troops from Maucune's division, then beset by a brigade of British heavy dragoons led by John Le Marchant. Attacked before they could form square, Brenier's battalions were overrun and routed. However, some troops managed to rally in a forest and emerged from the woods in battle order. The heavy dragoons attacked again, this time breaking the division for good, but Le Marchant was killed in the action.Gates, p 355 Later career Brenier played an honorable part in the campaign of 1813. Leading the 9th Division in Marshal Michel Ney's III Corps, he was severely wounded at the Battle of L√ºtzen in Saxony on 2 May 1813. In 1814 he became commander of the 16th military district and supervised the fortification of Lille. Afterwards he took over the command of the city of Brest, where his actions during the Hundred Days earned him a sword of honour voted him by the municipal council. Brenier became a Count, the Inspector General of the Infantry from 1816 to 1818, and the supreme commander in Corsica from 1820 to 1823. He retired in 1827 and died on 8 October 1832. His name appears on the west side of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, on Column 35.

His real name is Leopoldo Garc√≠a Pel√°ez Ben√≠tez , known internationally for his elaborate joke telling and narration, mainly in first person, as a supposed personal experience, this method, in conjunction with explicit language and in sexual nature, word play and double entendres (often, in the process cracking jokes within jokes, delivering witty lines and quips) oriented mainly to adult audiences.  Biography  Leopoldo was born in Le√≥n, Guanajuato, Mexico, in a family dedicated to the shoe industry. After devoting several years to the family business, he discovered his humorous vocation, which lead at first to work in small establishments without payment. The popularity of Polo Polo gradually increased, and in 1976 he moved to a bigger club called Keops Nightclub where his shows were presented every night with all tickets sold out. His popularity reached new heights. For many consecutive years, the spectacle of Polo Polo was a hallmark of the nightclub \\"Khufu\\", until in 1986 he had the opportunity to perform in the largest room in Mexico called Crown Hall Crown Hotel Plaza, and other mass events. In addition, the actor recorded his first live album with record company Musart, entitled The Trip to Spain. Despite the lack of radio broadcasting (due to the explicit content of the blue material), the album sold over 100,000 copies. This period of unparalleled success and activity is most memorable for Polo Polo, as it is when he set the record for the show with the longest duration, which remains in effect to date. The decade of the 80s was marked by his constant appearances on late-night television, and he was in demand throughout Mexico, including a debut coming out of the territory of Mexico. His first appearance in United States in 1988, invited by the Exclusive Artist Productions in the Super Club Chache Hollywood where their presentations played to packed houses for 10 days In the 90s Polo Polo was becoming one of the favorites of the public and continued to travel in Mexico and the United States.

Background  The Golers lived together in two shacks in a remote wooded area south of the community of White Rock, outside the town of Wolfville. Like most other mountain clans, they were isolated from most of the residents of the farming district in the Annapolis Valley and most of the nearby towns. The Goler adults, some of whom had intellectual disabilities, had little schooling and rarely worked. The Golers supported themselves on a combination of social welfare and occasional labor at the many nearby farms, supplemented by fishing and foraging for berries and other fruits. The children were generally forced to perform any menial chores (such as preparing food or removing trash). Garbage was simply thrown into the attic, until it was completely filled, and then the adults would make the children haul it all out. From about 1980, several of the children had attempted to tell outsiders and authorities about the abuse they suffered, but were disbelieved and returned to their family who punished them. In 1984, one of the children, a 14-year-old girl, revealed the details of a long history of torture and abuse (physical, sexual, and psychological), to a school official. According to further details uncovered by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, this abuse and forced incestuous relationships had been taking place for multiple generations. As the case was investigated, authorities learned that a number of Goler children were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, sisters, brothers, cousins, and each other. During interrogation by police, several of the adults openly admitted to, and even boasted about, engaging in many forms of sexual activity, up to and including full intercourse, multiple times with the children. They often went into graphic detail, claiming that the children themselves had initiated the activity.  Trial and aftermath  Eventually, fifteen men and one woman were charged with hundreds of allegations of incest and sexual abuse of children as young as five. Given the detailed confessions by the accused, authorities did not anticipate a trial. However, the accused eventually recanted their confessions and denied any wrongdoing. The case garnered significant attention in the media. The legal system of Kings County, Nova Scotia was strained by the Goler case. There was only one full-time prosecutor who normally handled one or two rape cases per year, alongside a relatively small number of assaults, thefts, disorderly conduct and other crimes. Thirteen of the accused received jail sentences of one to seven years. The event brought to the greater attention the inadequate living conditions of many poorer Kings County residents, not only on North Mountain and South Mountain where some 4,000 poor lived, but in the rich farmlands around Kentville where tar paper shacks blighted the landscape. These communities had been shunned by society forcing them to look inwards for support. Authorities had largely ignored them for a century or more, despite documents dating to the 1860s that showed the prevalence of intra-family relationships through high rates of birth defects and mental retardation, although the county's low- income housing society had been working to build 565-square-feet 'hearth homes'. Due to the sensational nature of the crime, the trial received extensive national coverage. A book entitled On South Mountain: The Dark Secrets of the Goler Clan was written and published in 1998 covering their story in detail. Donna Goler, one of the abused children who was removed from the Goler household when she was 11, has become an outspoken activist for stricter child abuse laws, and for stronger protection of children from convicted child molesters. Donna's testimony was described by both the prosecutor and defense attorneys as the most important evidence presented at trial. A year after the book On South Mountain was published, she began a long fight to revise the Criminal Code, saying that it failed to protect the young relatives of convicted child molesters.\\"Canada House of Commons Debates\\", Volume 135, Number 124, 1st Session, 36th Parliament.

On June 29, 1941, days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the DNSAP's newspaper F√¶drelandet proclaimed the creation of the corps. Its formation was subsequently sanctioned by the democratically elected Danish government which authorized officers of the Danish Army to join the unit. The corps was disbanded in 1943. During the course of the war, approximately 6,000 Danes joined the corps, including 77 officers of the Royal Danish Army.  Establishment  Footage from a Waffen-SS memorial service held near Birker√∏d in 1944. Among the attendees were Dr. Werner Best and Knud B√∏rge Martinsen. Free Corps Denmark marching in Germany 1941. Denmark had signed a treaty of nonaggression with Nazi Germany in 1939. Germany invoked this treaty on April 9, 1940, when it ordered the military occupation of Denmark under the guise of protecting the Danes from British invasion. Faced with potential German aerial bombing, King Christian X and the Danish government accepted \\"protection of the Reich\\" and permitted the \\"peaceful occupation\\" of the country in return for nominal political independence. The Danes began a policy of collaboration that included diplomatic and economic support of Germany. Cecil von Renthe- Fink, a German diplomat, was accredited to the Danish King and Cabinet as Reichsbevollm√§chtigter (\\"Imperial Plenipotentiary\\") and charged with the duty of supervising Danish government. At the outset of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Germany asked Denmark to form a military corps to fight with the Germans against the Soviets. On June 29, 1941, seven days after the invasion had begun, the Danish Nazi Party newspaper F√¶drelandet (\\"The Fatherland\\") proclaimed the creation of the Free Corps Denmark. Danish Foreign Minister Erik Scavenius entered into an agreement with the Reichsbevollm√§chtigter that officers and soldiers of the Danish Royal Army wishing to join this corps would be given leave and allowed to retain their rank. The Danish Cabinet issued an announcement stating that \\"Lieut. Colonel Christian Peder Kryssing, Chief of the 5th Artillery Regiment, Holb√¶k, has with the consent of the Royal Danish Government assumed command over Free Corps Denmark. Free Corps Denmark was one of \\"four national legions\\" established by the Waffen-SS in 1941. The original number of accepted recruits in 1941 was 1,164 men. The role of the Danish government in forming the Free Corps Denmark is today disputed. Some authorities maintain that the Corps was unique among the legions of foreign volunteers fighting for Hitler in that it carried the official sanction of its home government. Others maintain that while the Danish government may have sanctioned formation of the Corps that it did not itself form the Corps.  Recruitment  It is estimated that approximately 6,000 Danes served in the Free Corps Denmark. A 1998 study showed that the average recruit to Free Corps Denmark was a Nazi and/or a member of the German minority in Denmark, and that recruitment was very broad socially. Bo Lidegaard notes: \\"The relationship between the population and the corps was freezing cold, and legionnaires on leave time and again came into fights with civilians meeting the corps' volunteers with massive contempt.\\" Lidegaard gives the following figures for 1941: 6,000 Danish citizens had signed up and were approved for German army duty and 1,500 of these belonged to the German minority in Denmark. Half of the over 12,000 Danes that initially volunteered for active service were regarded as being not suitable for active service.  Service record  Danish Free Corps members make an oath in 1941 With about 1,000 recruits, the corps was sent to Langenhorn barracks in Hamburg for basic training in late July 1941. It was considered ready for action by September 15 and sent to Owi≈Ñska in Poland. C.P. Kryssing was dismissed in February 1942 for insufficient ideological adherence to Nazism. He was transferred to the artillery where he actually ended his career as a general. Christian Frederik von Schalburg ‚Äî a Danish-Russian aristocrat, anti-communist and member of the DNSAP who had been raised in Russia and had seen the aftermath of the Russian revolution in 1917 ‚Äî replaced Kryssing as the leader of Frikorps Danmark. On May 8, 1942, the corps was ordered to the front line. The corps fought near Demyansk south of Lake Ilmen and Novgorod. During the night of June 2, Schalburg was killed. Hans Albert von Lettow- Vorbeck, his German replacement, was killed only a few days later. On July 11, 1942, Knud B√∏rge Martinsen took command of the corps. From August to October, the corps returned to Denmark, and met much hostility from the civilian population. On November 13, 1942, the corps was deployed to Jelgava in Latvia. Originally, it was intended for anti-partisan activities, but it was then moved up to the front line. In December, the corps engaged in the Battle of Velikiye Luki in intense fighting, alongside the 1 SS Infantry Brigade. In March, the corps was transferred to Grafenw√∂hr near Nuremberg in Germany. Then on June 6, 1943, the corps was disbanded. Most soldiers were transferred to \\"Regiment 24 D√§nemark\\" in \\"Division Nordland\\".

The story, \\"among the most fantastic of all UFO reports,\\" contributed to early theories of UFOs as airborne organisms. History On September 5, 1891, the Crawfordsville Journal reported that two ice delivery men sighted \\"a strange phenomenon\\" that hovered in the air above their location, describing it as a \\"horrible apparition\\" that \\"filled them with dread.\\" A similar sighting was reported by a Methodist pastor and his wife. The Crawfordsville Journal described it as \\"about eighteen feet long and eight feet wide and moved rapidly through the air by means of several pairs of side fins. It was pure white and had no definite shape or form, resembling somewhat a great white shroud fitted with propelling fins. There was no tail or head visible but there was one great flaming eye, and a sort of a wheezing plaintive sound was emitted from a mouth which was invisible. It flapped like a flag in the winds as it came on and frequently gave a great squirm as though suffering unutterable agony.\\" According to interviews conducted years later by Crawfordsville reporter and Fortean Society member Vincent Gaddis, hundreds of residents observed the phenomenon on the following evening, with some claiming they could feel the monster's \\"hot breath\\" as it swooped over them. The Indianapolis Journal repeated the September 5th sightings, as did other newspapers across the country,Indianapolis Journal,Indianapolis, Marion County, 7 September 1891 including the Brooklyn Eagle,Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 10 September 1891 whose article later attracted the attention of early paranormal investigator Charles Fort. The Crawfordsville Postmaster was deluged with mail, and reports of the sightings generated both ridicule and a number of believers. Two local men, John Hornbeck and Abe Hernley, \\"followed the wraith about town and finally discovered it to be a flock of many hundred killdeer.\\" The Crawfordsville Journal suggested that Crawfordsville's newly installed electric lights disoriented the birds, which caused them to hover above the city. The birds' wings and white under-feathers likely resulted in misidentification. In popular culture The monster has been adapted as a fantasy games monster under the D20-Modern gaming system,D20-Modern: Menace Creatures, The Crawfordsville Monster, (October 2006)World of Sulerin - Monstrous Index: Crawfordsville Monster, (October 2006) where it is classified as being an ooze-based creature that resembles an amoeba.D20-Modern: Menace Creatures, The Crawfordsville Monster, (Image), (October 2006) The myth was featured on an episode of the History Channel show MonsterQuest.

In the 2009 football season, the Trojans defeated rivals South Pointe High School in the 4A state- semifinals on November 27, 2009, at the Rock Hill School District Football Stadium. This propelled them to the state championship game at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia where they lost to Berkeley. On July 10, 2010 it was announced that Northwestern would play South Pointe High School, in a nationally televised double-header on ESPN August 28. Northwestern showed their power offense in that game where they beat South Pointe 42-20. The key came when they scored five touchdowns in 4 minutes and 50 seconds in the third quarter, taking a 20-7 deficit to 42-20. In the 2010 football season, the Trojans had a perfect 15-0 season and went to the state championship game at South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium, playing Greenwood. The Trojans defeated Greenwood 42-10 and won the state championship. In 2012 second year head coach Kyle Richardson led the Trojans back to the state championship, where they lost to Greenwood in overtime. In 2010 QB Justin Worley was named National Gatorade Player of the Year, joining previous winners Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and numerous other pro athletes. Worley is the first and only National Gatorade Player of Year from South Carolina. The baseball team is consistently in the playoffs, and has produced numerous collegiate players. Northwestern athletics have produced several collegiate student-athletes, going to such major universities as Clemson University, South Carolina, Florida State, Georgia, Notre Dame, Ohio State and The College of Charleston.

This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group‚Äîwith its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories‚Äîshape processes of human cognition, emotion, perception, motivation, and mental health. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes. Each school within psychological anthropology has its own approach.D'Andrade, R. G. (1995). The development of cognitive anthropology. New York, Cambridge University Press. Schwartz, T., G. M. White, et al., Eds. (1992). New Directions in Psychological Anthropology. Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press. History Psychological Anthropology has been interwoven with anthropology since the beginning. Wilhelm Wundt was a German psychologist and pioneer in folk psychology. His objectives were to form psychological explanations using the reports of ethnologists. He made different contracting stages such as the 'totemic' stage, the 'age of heroes and gods', and the 'enlightened age of humanity'. Unlike most, Wundt believed that the mind of both 'primitive' and civilised groups had equivalent learning capabilities but that they simply used that capacity in different ways. Though intimately connected in many ways, the fields of anthropology and psychology have generally remained separate. Where anthropology was traditionally geared towards historical and evolutionary trends, what psychology concerned itself with was more ahistorical and acultural in nature. Psychoanalysis joined the two fields together. In 1972 Francis L. K. Hsu suggested that the field of culture and personality be renamed 'psychological anthropology'. Hsu considered the original title old fashioned given that many anthropologists regarded personality and culture as the same, or in need of better explanations. During the 1970s and 1980s, psychological anthropology began to shift its focus towards the study of human behaviour in a natural setting. Schools Psychoanalytic anthropology This school is based upon the insights of Sigmund Freud and other psychoanalysts as applied to social and cultural phenomena. Adherents of this approach often assumed that techniques of child- rearing shaped adult personality and that cultural symbols (including myths, dreams, and rituals) could be interpreted using psychoanalytical theories and techniques. The latter included interviewing techniques based on clinical interviewing, the use of projective tests such as the TATMurray, H. A. (1943). Thematic Apperception Test. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press. and the Rorschach, and a tendency towards including case studies of individual interviewees in their ethnographies. A major example of this approach was the Six Cultures Study under John and Beatrice Whiting in Harvard's Department of Social Relations. This study examined child-rearing in six very different cultures (New England Baptist community; a Philippine barrio; an Okinawan village; an Indian village in Mexico; a northern Indian caste group; and a rural tribal group in Kenya).Whiting, Beatrice and John Whiting. 1975. Children of Six Cultures: a psychocultural analysis. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. Some practitioners look specifically at mental illness cross-culturally (George Devereux) or at the ways in which social processes such as the oppression of ethnic minorities affect mental health (Abram Kardiner), while others focus on the ways in which cultural symbols or social institutions provide defense mechanisms (Melford Spiro) or otherwise alleviate psychological conflicts (Gananath Obeyesekere).Obeyesekere, G. (1985). Depression, Buddhism, and the work of culture in Sri Lanka. In: Culture and depression: studies in the anthropology and cross-cultural psychology of affect and disorder. A. Kleinman and B. J. Good. Berkeley / Los Angeles, University of California Press: 134-152. Some have also examined the cross-cultural applicability of psychoanalytic concepts such as the Oedipus complex (Melford Spiro).Kilborne, B. and L. L. Langness, Eds. (1987). Culture and human nature: Theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro. Chicago, University of Chicago Press. Others who might be considered part of this school are a number of scholars who, although psychoanalysts, conducted fieldwork (Erich Fromm) or used psychoanalytic techniques to analyze materials gathered by anthropologists (Sigmund Freud, Erik Erikson, G√©za R√≥heim). Because many American social scientists during the first two-thirds of the 20th century had at least a passing familiarity with psychoanalytic theory, it is hard to determine precisely which ones should be considered primarily as psychoanalytic anthropologists. Many anthropologists who studied personality (Cora DuBois, Clyde Kluckhohn, Geoffrey Gorer) drew heavily on psychoanalysis; most members of the \\"culture and personality school\\" of psychological anthropology did so. In recent years, psychoanalytic and more broadly psychodynamic theory continues to influence some psychological anthropologists (such as Gilbert Herdt, Douglas Hollan, and Robert LeVine) and have contributed significantly to such approaches as person-centered ethnographyLevy, R. I. and D. Hollan (1998). Person-centered interviewing and observation in anthropology. Handbook of methods in cultural anthropology. H. R. Bernard. Walnut Creek, CA, Altamira Press: 333-364. and clinical ethnography.Herdt, G. (1999). \\"Clinical ethnography and sexual culture.\\" Annual Review of Sex Research 10: 100-119. It thus may make more sense to consider psychoanalytic anthropology since the latter part of the 20th century as more a style or a set of research agendas that cut across several other approaches within anthropology. See also: Robert I. Levy, Ari Kiev. Culture and personality Personality is the overall characteristics that a person possesses. All of these characteristics are acquired within a culture. However, when a person changes his or her culture, his or her personality automatically changes because the person learns to follow the norms and values of the new culture, and this, in turn, influences the individual's personal characteristics. Configurationalist approach This approach describes a culture as a personality; that is, interpretation of experiences, guided by symbolic structure, creates personality which is \\"copied\\" into the larger culture. Leading figures include Ruth Benedict, A. Irving Hallowell, and Margaret Mead. Basic and modal personality Major figures include John Whiting and Beatrice Whiting, Cora DuBois, and Florence Kluckhohn. National character Leading figures include sociologist Alex Inkeles and anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn. Ethnopsychology Major figures: Vincent Crapanzano, Georges Devereux, Tobie Nathan, Catherine Lutz, Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo, Renato Rosaldo, Charles Nuckolls, Bradd Shore, and Dorinne K. Kondo Cognitive anthropology Cognitive anthropology takes a number of methodological approaches, but generally draws on the insights of cognitive science in its model of the mind. A basic premise is that people think with the aid of schemas, units of culturally shared knowledge that are hypothesized to be represented in the brain as networks of neural connections.D'Andrade, Roy G. (1995). The Development of Cognitive Anthropology. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. This entails certain properties of cultural models, and may explain both part of the observed inertia of cultural models (people's assumptions about the way the world works are hard to change) and patterns of association.Strauss, Claudia and Naomi Quinn (1997) A Cognitive Theory of Cultural Meaning. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Roy D'Andrade (1995) sees the history of cognitive anthropology proper as divisible into four phases. The first began in the 1950s with the explicit formulation of culture as knowledge by anthropologists such as Ward GoodenoughGoodenough, W. H. (1969). Rethinking \\"status\\" and \\"role\\": toward a general model of the cultural organization of social relationships. Cognitive Anthropology. S. A. Tyler. New York, Holt, Rhinehart and Winston: 311-330. and Anthony Wallace. From the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, attention focused on categorization, componential analysis (a technique borrowed from structuralist linguistics), and native or folk systems of knowledge (ethnoscience e.g., ethnobotany, ethnolinguistics and so on), as well as discoveries in patterns of color naming by Brent Berlin and Paul Kay. During the 1950s and 1960s, most of the work in cognitive anthropology was carried out at Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, Berkeley, University of California, Irvine, and the Harvard Department of Social Relations. The third phase looked at types of categories (Eleanor Rosch) and cultural models, drawing on schema theory, linguistic work on metaphor (George Lakoff, Mark Johnson). The current phase, beginning in the 1990s, has seen more focus on the problem of how cultural models are shared and distributed, as well as on motivation,D'Andrade (1995: 244-248) with significant work taking place at UC San Diego, UCLA, UC Berkeley, University of Connecticut, and Australian National University, among others. Currently, different cognitive anthropologists are concerned with how groups of individuals are able to coordinate activities and \\"thinking\\" (Edwin Hutchins); with the distribution of cultural models (who knows what, and how people access knowledge within a culture: Dorothy Holland, A. Kimball Romney, Dan Sperber, Marc Swartz); with conflicting models within a culture (Naomi Quinn, Holly Mathews); or the ways in which cultural models are internalized and come to motivate behavior (Roy D'Andrade, Naomi Quinn, Charles Nuckolls, Bradd Shore, Claudia Strauss).D'Andrade, Roy G. and Claudia Strauss. (1992) Human Motives and Cultural Models. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Some cognitive anthropologists continue work on ethnoscience (Scott Atran), most notably in collaborative field projects with cognitive and social psychologists on culturally universal versus culturally particular models of human categorization and inference and how these mental models hinder or help social adaptations to natural environments.Atran, Scott and Douglas Medin, (2008) The Native Mind and the Cultural Construction of Nature. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. Others focus on methodological issues such as how to identify cultural models.Holland, Dorothy and Naomi Quinn, (Eds.) (1987) Cultural Models in Language and Thought. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.Quinn, Naomi, (Ed.) (2005) Finding Culture in Talk: a collection of methods. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Related work in cognitive linguistics and semantics also carries forward research on the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis and looks at the relationship between language and thought (Maurice Bloch, John Lucy, Anna Wierzbicka).Wierzbicka, Anna (1999) Emotions across Languages and Cultures: diversity and universals. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.Wierzbicka, Anna (1993) \\"A conceptual basis for cultural psychology.\\" Ethos 21:205 - 231. Psychiatric anthropology While not forming a school in the sense of having a particular methodological approach, a number of prominent psychological anthropologists have addressed significant attention to the interaction of culture and mental health or mental illness (Jenkins and Barrett 2004), ranging through the description and analysis of culture-bound syndromes (Pow-Meng Yap, Ronald Simons, Charles Hughes); the relationship between cultural values or culturally mediated experiences and the development or expression of mental illness (among immigrants, for instance more particularly) (Thomas Csordas, George Devereux, Robert Edgerton, Sue Estroff, Arthur Kleinman, Roberto Beneduce, Robert Lemelson, Theresa O'Nell, Marvin Opler); to the training of mental health practitioners and the cultural construction of mental health as a profession (Charles W. Nuckolls, Tanya Luhrmann), and more recently to the cultural creation of a \\"pharmaceutical self\\" in a globalizing world (Jenkins 2011). Recent research focuses on specific relationships between History, conscience, cultural Self and suffering (Roberto Beneduce, Etnopsichiatria. Sofferenza mentale e alterit√† fra Storia, dominio e cultura, 2007). Some of these have been primarily trained as psychiatrists rather than anthropologists: Abram Kardiner, Arthur Kleinman, Robert I. Levy, Roberto Beneduce, Roland Littlewood. Further research has been done on genetic predisposition, family's contribution to the genesis of psychopathology, and the contribution of environmental factors such as tropical diseases, natural catastrophes, and occupational hazards. Today During most of the history of modern anthropology (with the possible exception of the 1930s through the 1950s, when it was an influential approach within American social thought), psychological anthropology has been a relatively small though productive subfield. D'Andrade, for instance, estimates that the core group of scholars engaged in active research in cognitive anthropology (one of the smaller sub-subfields), have numbered some 30 anthropologists and linguists, with the total number of scholars identifying with this subfield likely being less than 200 at any one time.D'Andrade (1995: xiv) At present, relatively few universities have active graduate training programs in psychological anthropology.

It belongs to the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n in the northwest of Spain, in the so denominated region of Esla-Oteros. Its surface is of about 21 km2. In 2004 it had a population of 896 inhabitants of who 669 resided in the town (according to data of the National Institute of Statistic). Toral is located in National 630 between Le√≥n, Spain, which is 42 km away and Benavente, Zamora, to a distance of about 28 km, in also known as Via de la Plata, and 9 km away from Valencia de Don Juan, the local head, to which is connected by means of a local road, the CV-232. In addition the town gets exit to the A-66 highway that links Le√≥n and Benavente. The landscape of the town is the one of a fertile valley, drilled during thousands of years by the Esla river that delimits to the east its extension. The limit on the west is demarcated by the slope that separates the town from the Paramo Leon√©s. This one slope has a stony land strip, that years ago was full of vineyard fields, today missing in its totality, only remaining the warehouses, colorful constructions dug in the Earth. The fertile valley extends from the north to the south, being Villademor de la Vega and Algadefe the populations that delimit Toral in this direction. The farming territories are fertile, partly due to the work of the farmers during hundreds of years of work, and partly by the wealth of the land and the abundance of water. The climate is typically continental, with extreme temperatures in winter and summer. Toral is a locality eminently agriculturist and cattle dealer, with a percentage of the population dedicating to the construction industry and other services, mainly due to the proximity to the capital, to Valencia de Don Juan and to Benavente, that monopolize these activities.

Meanwhile, Lucie starts her new job at Hulbert Logistics, an office in Telford, believing that her travels with the Doctor were all a dream. The Doctor arrives at the office and restores Lucie's memories. She realises that this is the job she was meant to start before she was taken by the Time Lords. He decides to investigate and finds the staff working on military tactics. Lucie is fired from the job and is ejected from the office with another member of staff, Karen. The office is revealed to be the interior of a giant war machine on an alien planet, where they find a small group of other ex-employees. Meanwhile, the Doctor finds a dimensional corridor in the human resources department, which leads to an office on Earth run by a man called Hulbert, who explains that he helps aliens fight wars by brainwashing humans to run the war machines. Believing the Doctor to be his latest 'client', he takes him to a conference on the alien planet to demonstrate his company's effectiveness as the current targets of his corporations have been hunted to near extinction. Believing Hulbert's plans to be unjustified, the Doctor sabotages the conference's defensive systems, only to discover that the war is being fought against Cybermen, who storm the conference room. Part 2 Hubert agrees to work with the Cybermen, against the Doctor's advice. The Doctor learns that these Cybermen are an earlier version of the Cybermen he will encounter on Telos, having not recognised the name of the planet. Lucie and the ex-employees meet the Headhunter, who explains she was hired by Hubert to track Lucie down in case a rival company was trying to reverse-engineer his brainwashing techniques. As she has no desire to see the Cybermen win, she agrees to help them. Lucie returns to the office with the other ex-employees and regains control. Meanwhile, the Cybermen have summoned the office as it has a 100% success record, and they also intend to use the dimensional corridor to invade Earth. The office attacks the Cybermen whilst Lucie sneaks out and rescues the Doctor. They re-enter the office where Lucie shows the Doctor a device which she found in the office, which he recognizes as a Quantum Crystalliser, a device which alters possible future timelines to ensure the best possible outcome for the user. They both go in the TARDIS to talk to another Time Lord who explains that the war had been engineered by the Celestial Intervention Agency to try to eliminate the Cybermen. The Time Lord also explains that the CIA predicted that Lucie would become a dictator who would interfere with mankind's progress, so they also used a Crystalliser to alter her past to prevent this, but eventually they had to pull her out of time into the TARDIS, as contact with another Crystalliser would lead to her timeline becoming dangerously unstable. Realising that the Time Lords have manipulated her life Lucie takes the Quantum Crystalliser and runs back to the office. The Doctor realises that the Time Lords mistook Lucie for Karen when they pulled her out of time due to them both having job interviews on the same day, and Karen is the one destined to become a dictator. The Headhunter tries to talk Lucie into using the Quantum Crystalliser to get revenge on the Time Lords. The Doctor arrives and explains the situation to her. She gives him the Crystalliser, but is shocked when he gives it to the Cybermen. However, the Cyberman who uses it instantly suffers total systems failure and is killed. The Doctor explains that the Quantum Crystalliser has been programmed to ensure that the Cybermen are defeated, so he increases the range on it, causing all of the Cybermen to be killed, and rendering the device itself useless. Whilst the Time Lords return the office workers home and Karen decides to become the Headhunter's new assistant, the Doctor and Lucie leave to new adventures.

It is surrounded by Wall Township and the boroughs of Spring Lake, Spring Lake Heights, and Sea Girt. The pond was originally connected to the sea by a small inlet and got its name because sailors would mistake it, in the dark, for the Manasquan Inlet, which is further south. This was alleviated by the building of the Sea Girt Lighthouse and stopped by the eventual filling in of the inlet. The pond is the center of the Wreck Pond Watershed, which covers about in eastern Monmouth County. Its primary feeder streams are Wreck Pond Brook, Hurleys Pond Brook and Hannabrand Brook. Other bodies of water in the watershed include: Hurleys Pond, Osbornes Pond, Albert Pond and Old Mill Pond. It emptied into the Atlantic Ocean through an outfall pipe which regulates the tidal flow in and out of the pond. After Hurricane Sandy, it was discovered that the ocean had restored a natural inlet. An expanded and gated culvert was completed in 2016. The lower reaches of the pond remain an important spawning ground for anadromous fish species including alewife herrings. Some of the acres of land surrounding Wreck Pond are under public ownership and are protected from development. Other lands are considered freshwater wetlands and are protected from development by federal and New Jersey laws and regulations. The watershed is part of the South Coast Subwatershed Management Region. The pond depth has decreased substantially over several years as sediments carried by feeder creeks and increased storm water runoff have settled into it. This has also caused the pond to become choked with fecal coliform bacteria. Much water flowing into the pond from storms causes the pond to flush into the Atlantic Ocean. This, in turn, often causes the closure of ocean beaches in Sea Girt and Spring Lake. The source of the coliform contamination is debated. A recent study conducted by Prof. John Tiedemann of Monmouth University tracked the source of bacterial contaminants in the Wreck Pond Watershed. Tiedemann's group set up and monitored 12 stations throughout the watershed for a period of approximately two years. In this time, they determined that the major source of bacterial coliform contaminants is human waste. These contaminants may be introduced into the waterways via aging sewers, improperly capped septic systems, and illegal sewer connections. Recommendations are being prepared for distribution to municipalities throughout the watershed to assist the governing bodies in remediating problems within their jurisdictions. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection funded a partial dredging of Wreck Pond and the extension of the storm water runoff pipe about farther into the ocean. While it was hoped this would prevent pollution from affecting beaches in neighboring towns, it has been determined that the effluvium from the pipe still washes up on local beaches. Additionally, Monmouth County has mandated that after a rainfall of 1/4\\" or more, the beaches are automatically closed. The Wreck Pond Watershed Preservation Association, a group of local residents, environmental activists and government officials interested in preserving Wreck Pond, meets frequently to discuss issues with preserving the area.

It is served by Amtrak intercity rail and Metrolink commuter rail service, Metro Busway bus rapid transit, and several local and express bus operators. Chatsworth is served by five daily Amtrak Pacific Surfliner round trips and eleven weekday Metrolink Ventura County Line round trips; it is also the northern terminus of the Metro Orange Line. The station is served by Metro Local and Simi Valley Transit local buses, plus Santa Clarita Transit and LADOT Commuter Express regional routes. The Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) opened its first Chatsworth station in 1893; SP service ended in the 1950s. CalTrain service from 1982-83, and Amtrak service beginning in 1988, used a station located to the southeast. Metrolink service began in 1992 with a station near the former SP station site; Amtrak service soon moved there. A station building was completed in 1996, and Orange Line service began in 2012. History Orange Line platform at Chatsworth in 2015 The Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) opened a branch line from Burbank to Chatsworth in 1893. The SP extended the branch westward in 1904, eventually forming the Coast Line. The 1893-built station was a typical style: a two- story wooden depot with a longer one-story freight house. It was replaced with a similar larger station in 1910, and burned in 1917; the newer station was demolished in 1962. An infill station opened in Chatsworth on the short-lived CalTrain line on December 29, 1982, only to close when service ended on March 2, 1983. On June 26, 1988, Amtrak extended one San Diegan round trip to Santa Barbara, with the ex-CalTrain stop at Chatsworth reused as an intermediate stop. The stop was located just east of DeSoto Avenue, southeast of the former SP station site. On October 26, 1992, Metrolink Ventura County Line service began. The Metrolink station - a bare platform with small shelters - was located near the original station site; Amtrak soon moved its operations to the Metrolink station. The Chatsworth Transportation Center, opened in 1996, was designed to echo the appearance of the 1893-built station. The -long structure cost $1.7 million. The station originally had only a single side platform on the east (main) track; a second platform on the west (siding) track was later added. On June 30, 2012, the LACMTA opened a extension of Orange Line bus rapid transit, with Chatsworth as the northern terminus.

According to the United States Federal Railroad Administration Office of Safety Analysis,Federal Railroad Administration track defects are the second leading cause of accidents on railways in the United States. The leading cause of railway accidents is attributed to human error. The contribution of poor management decisions to rail accidents caused by infrequent or inadequate rail inspection is significant but not reported by the FRA, only the NTSB. Every year, North American railroads spend millions of dollars to inspect the rails for internal and external flaws. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are used as a preventive measures against track failures and possible derailment. History An Inspection Car En Route, 1891 The first rail inspections were done visually. Many sources cite that the need for better rail inspections came after a derailment at Manchester, New York, in 1911. That particular accident resulted in the death of 29 people and injuries to 60 others. The investigation of the accident revealed that the cause was a transverse fissure (a critical crack which lies perpendicular to the length of the rail) in the rail. Further investigation in the late 1920s showed that this type of defect was quite common. With increased rail traffic at higher speeds and with heavier axle loads today, critical crack sizes are shrinking and rail inspection is becoming more important. In 1927, Dr. Elmer Sperry built a massive rail inspection car under contract with the American Railway Association. Magnetic induction was the method used on the first rail inspection cars. This was done by passing large amounts of magnetic field through the rail and detecting flux leakage with search coils. Since then, many other inspection cars have traversed the rails in search of flaws. Defects and location Broken rail Damaged rail There are many effects that influence rail defects and rail failure. These effects include bending and shear stresses, wheel/rail contact stresses, thermal stresses, residual stresses and dynamic effects. Defects due to contact stresses or rolling contact fatigue (RCF): *tongue lipping *head checking (gauge corner cracking) *squats - which start as small surface breaking cracks Other forms of surface and internal defects: *corrosion *inclusions *seams *shelling *transverse fissures *wheel burn One effect that can cause crack propagation is the presence of water and other liquids. When a fluid fills a small crack and a train passes over, the water becomes trapped in the void and can expand the crack tip. Also, the trapped fluid could freeze and expand or initiate the corrosion process. Parts of a rail where defects can be found: *head *web *foot *switchblades *welds *bolt holes A majority of the flaws found in rails are located in the head, however, flaws are also found in the web and foot. This means that the entire rail needs to be inspected. NDT methods Holland Trackstar HiRail measurement vehicle in operation testing rail geometry, strength, and profile A list of methods used to detect flaws in rails: *Ultrasound - the most popular method *Eddy current inspection - great for surface flaws & near surface flaws *Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) - used for detailed manual inspection *Radiography - used on specific locations (often predetermined) such as bolt holes and where thermite welding was used *Magnetic induction or Magnetic flux leakage - earliest method used to locate unseen flaws in the railway industry *EMAT Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer Utilizing NDT methods The techniques mentioned above are utilized in a handful of different ways. The probes and transducers can be utilized on a \\"walking stick\\", on a hand pushed trolley, or in a hand held setup. These devices are used when small sections of track are to be inspected or when a precise location is desired. Many times these detail oriented inspection devices follow up on indications made by a rail inspection cars or HiRail trucks. Handheld inspection devices are very useful for this when the track is used heavily, because they can be removed relatively easy. However, they are considered very slow and tedious, when there are thousands of miles of track that need inspection. Rail inspection cars and HiRail trucks are the answer to today's high mileage inspection needs. The first rail inspection cars were created by Dr. Sperry. Since then, many new models have rolled out. These rail inspection cars are basically their own train with inspection equipment on board. The probes and transducers are mounted on carriages located underneath the inspection car. Modern day inspection cars now use multiple NDT methods. Induction and ultrasound methods can be used in rail inspection cars and operate at testing speeds of more than . The next generation will go even faster. There are many manufacturers of road/rail inspection trucks, otherwise known as HiRail trucks. These HiRail inspection cars are almost all ultrasonic testing exclusively, but there are some with the capability to perform multiple tests. These trucks are loaded with high speed computers using advanced programs which recognize patterns and contain classification information. The trucks are also equipped with storage space, tool cabinets, and workbenches. A GPS unit is used with the computer to mark new defects and locate previously marked defects. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) requires that any indications of defects need to be hand verified immediately. The GPS system allows a follow up car to find precisely where the flaw was detected by the lead vehicle. One advantage to the HiRail trucks is that they can work around regular rail traffic without shutting down or slowing down entire stretches of track. However, because railroad management frequently orders HiRail trucks to be used to inspect tracks at speeds over , tracks reported as having been inspected are, in fact, not inspected. A NTSB report on the Amtrak derailment in Oregon in 2006 documented this fact. The future of rail inspection With increased rail traffic carrying heavier loads at higher speeds, a quicker more efficient way of inspecting railways is needed. Lasers inspect railway geometry, but one day they might be utilized as a form of non-contact evaluation of the rail. This most likely will be done with laser-optical transmitting transducers in ultrasonic testing. Eliminating contact with the rail could one day allow high speed detection of flaws. (Testing of rail is currently able to be done at 80 km per hour with a Speno US-6 Ultrasonics train) Another need for the future is a complete rail inspection system. A step in this direction is deeper investigation of the rail by using low frequency eddy currents. Other advancements could include neural network analysis of signals to improve defect detection and identification and longitudinal guided ultrasonics. Improved rail quality, composition, and joining techniques could lead to better wear characteristics and a longer lifespan of the rail. Some investigation into banitic steels looks promising. A safe and portable means of filmless radiography could assist with onsite defect evaluation. These are just a few advancements in the process of being developed for future use.

He is largely self-taught, having taken up the cornet at age 12 then switched to saxophone at 18. While stationed in Germany with the RAF (1958‚Äì63), he encountered the drummer John Stevens and trombonist Paul Rutherford. After being demobbed he returned to London. In 1965 he and Stevens formed the Spontaneous Music Ensemble, which became one of the crucibles of British free improvisation. Watts left the band to form his own group Amalgam in 1967, then returned to SME for another stretch that lasted until the mid-1970s. Another key association was with the bassist Barry Guy and his London Jazz Composers' Orchestra, an association that lasted from the band's inception in the 1970s up to its (permanent?) disbandment in the mid-1990s. Though he was initially strongly identified with the avant-garde, Watts is a versatile musician who has worked in everything from straight jazz contexts to rock and blues. His own projects have come increasingly to focus on blending jazz and African music, notably the Moir√© Music ensemble which he has led since 1982 in configurations ranging from large ensembles featuring multiple drummers to more intimate trios. He has only occasionally recorded in freer modes in recent years, notably the CD 6 Dialogues, a duet album with Veryan Weston (the pianist in earlier editions of Moir√© Music). A solo album, World Sonic, appeared on Hi4Head Records in 2005. Watts has toured the world over numerous times, run workshops, received grants and commissions, and he has collaborated with some of the great jazz musicians including Archie Shepp, Steve Lacy, Don Cherry, Jayne Cortez and Stephen Grew . As of 2011, he continues to travel and toured North American with Veryan Weston.

The objects can be: classical ideal gas elements such as rigid disks undergoing elastic collisions; elementary particles, or any ensemble of individual objects in physics which obeys laws of motion without binding interactions. The concept of a two-dimensional gas is used either because: * (a) the issue being studied actually takes place in two dimensions (as certain surface molecular phenomena); or, * (b) the two-dimensional form of the problem is more tractable than the analogous mathematically more complex three-dimensional problem. While physicists have studied simple two body interactions on a plane for centuries, the attention given to the two-dimensional gas (having many bodies in motion) is a 20th-century pursuit. Applications have led to better understanding of superconductivity, gas thermodynamics, certain solid state problems and several questions in quantum mechanics. Classical mechanics alt= Research at Princeton University in the early 1960sC.M.Hogan, Non- equilibrium statistical mechanics of a two-dimensional gas, Dissertation, Princeton University, Department of Physics, May 4, 1964 posed the question of whether the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics and other thermodynamic laws could be derived from Newtonian laws applied to multi-body systems rather than through the conventional methods of statistical mechanics. While this question appears intractable from a three-dimensional closed form solution, the problem behaves differently in two-dimensional space. In particular an ideal two-dimensional gas was examined from the standpoint of relaxation time to equilibrium velocity distribution given several arbitrary initial conditions of the ideal gas. Relaxation times were shown to be very fast: on the order of mean free time . In 1996 a computational approach was taken to the classical mechanics non-equilibrium problem of heat flow within a two-dimensional gas.D. Risso and P. Cordero, Two-Dimensional Gas of Disks: Thermal Conductivity, Journal of Statistical Physics, volume 82, pages 1453‚Äì1466, (1996) This simulation work showed that for N>1500, good agreement with continuous systems is obtained. Electron gas Diagram of cyclotron operation from Lawrence's 1934 patent. While the principle of the cyclotron to create a two-dimensional array of electrons has existed since 1934, the tool was originally not really used to analyze interactions among the electrons (e.g. two-dimensional gas dynamics). An early research investigation explored cyclotron resonance behavior and the de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect in a two-dimensional electron gas. The investigator was able to demonstrate that for a two-dimensional gas, the de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen oscillation period is independent of the short-range electron interactions. Later applications to Bose gas In 1991 a theoretical proof was made that a Bose gas can exist in two dimensions.Vanderlei Bagnato and Daniel Kleppner. Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation in low-dimensional traps, American Physical Society, 8 April 1991 In the same work an experimental recommendation was made that could verify the hypothesis. Experimental research with a molecular gas In general, 2D molecular gases are experimentally observed on weakly interacting surfaces such as metals, graphene etc. at a non-cryogenic temperature and a low surface coverage. As a direct observation of individual molecules is not possible due to fast diffusion of molecules on a surface, experiments are either indirect (observing an interaction of a 2D gas with surroundings, e.g. condensation of a 2D gas) or integral (measuring integral properties of 2D gases, e.g. by diffraction methods). An example of the indirect observation of a 2D gas is the study of Stranick et al. who used a scanning tunnelling microscope in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) to image an interaction of a two-dimensional benzene gas layer in contact with a planar solid interface at 77 kelvins.Stranick, S. J. ; Kamna, M. M. ; Weiss, P. S, Atomic Scale Dynamics of a Two-Dimensional Gas-Solid Interface, Pennsylvania State University, Park Dept. of Chemistry, 3 June 1994 The experimenters were able to observe mobile benzene molecules on the surface of Cu(111), to which a planar monomolecular film of solid benzene adhered. Thus the scientists could witness the equilibrium of the gas in contact with its solid state. Integral methods that are able to characterize a 2D gas usually fall into a category of diffraction (see for example study of Kroger et al.). The exception is the work of Matvija et al. who used a scanning tunneling microscope to directly visualize a local time-averaged density of molecules on a surface. This method is of special importance as it provides an opportunity to probe local properties of 2D gases; for instance it enables to directly visualize a pair correlation function of a 2D molecular gas in a real space. If the surface coverage of adsorbates is increased, a 2D liquid is formed, followed by a 2D solid. It was shown that the transition from a 2D gas to a 2D solid state can be controlled by a scanning tunneling microscope which can affect the local density of molecules via an electric field. Implications for future research A multiplicity of theoretical physics research directions exist for study via a two-dimensional gas. Examples of these are *Complex quantum mechanics phenomena, whose solutions may be more appropriate in a two- dimensional environment; *Studies of phase transitions (e.g. melting phenomena at a planar surface); *Thin film phenomena such as chemical vapor deposition; *Surface excitations of a solid.

It is the calcium salt of L-tartaric acid, an acid most commonly found in grapes. Its solubility decreases with lower temperature, which results in the forming of whitish (in red wine often reddish) crystalline clusters as it precipitates. As E number E354, it finds use as a food preservative and acidity regulator.

He fought in the American Civil War and later became the 16th Governor of Iowa. He is the namesake of Drake University. Biography Drake was born in Rushville, Illinois, the son of John Adams Drake and Harriet Jane O'Neal. He later moved to Centerville, Iowa. He received a good business education, and became a merchant. He married Mary Jane Lord on December 24, 1855. They had seven children. Drake as a brigadier general During the California Gold Rush, he led two expeditions across the plains from Iowa to California. The first one left in 1852. During that trip with ox teams, he and just 7 other teamsters encountered a band of 300 Pawnee on the plains of Nebraska and he succeeded in blunting their attack with little loss-reportedly after personally slaying the Pawnee leader with a knife, demoralizing the remaining Indians, who broke contact. The second trip in 1854 escorted a herd of cattle. Returning by ship after the second trip, he was wrecked off of Point Aquilla. Eight hundred passengers were killed, but Drake assisted in rescuing 200 passengers. After Fort Sumter, Drake obtained a Captain's commission and operated with a mounted Iowa border regiment patrolling northern Missouri and clearing out small bands of rebels. His leadership was quickly recognized and for a while he was placed in charge of a Federal depot at Hannibal Missouri. After Lincoln's July 1862 call for 300,000 more volunteers to serve for 3 years or until the end of the war, Drake was commissioned as lieutenant colonel in August 1862 of a regiment that was designated the 36th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The 36th was mustered into United State service on October 4, 1862 at Camp Lincoln, Keokuk, Iowa. The 36th departed Keokuk for Helena Arkansas in mid-November 1862. At Helena the regiment was assigned to the 13th Division of the XIII Army Corps and it was on garrison duty there until February 24, 1863, when the 13th Division was ordered by Grant to conduct a raid through the Yazoo Pass into the inland waterways of the Mississippi Delta to attempt to locate a northern approach to assault Vicksburg. Here Drake saw his first combat action as Executive Officer of the 36th, which was almost constantly under artillery fire from the rebel guns at Fort Pemberton, at the confluence of the Tallahatchie and Yazoo Rivers, and during which the 36th Iowa conducted two hazardous long-range reconnaissance-in-force operations to try to locate a dry land route that would enable them to flank the rebel fort, which had been reinforced with large naval cannon. The regiment suffered 5 wounded from enemy snipers and some half-dozen others died of fevers and were buried at Shell Mound, Mississippi adjacent to the Curtis Plantation on the banks of the Tallahatchie River. Shell Mound, an ancient Native American ceremonial mound, was some 1.5 miles north of the enemy fort located at a sharp bend in the river, three miles west of Greenwood, Mississippi. Lieutenant-Colonel Drake was nearly killed while leading the first reconnaissance operation when a large caliber enemy artillery shell that struck a large tree immediately in front of him and exploded. Despite efforts by Union gunboats to reduce Fort Pemberton, and with reinforcements sent by Grant, the Union forces abandoned the effort in April, and the 13th Division returned to Helena, arriving there on April 8. On July 4, 1863 Drake was on the sick list with all of the other staff officers during the Battle of Helena Arkansas. Although the staff officers were too sick to take part, the regiment--led by Captain Martin Varner (CO. A) as well as company officers and non-commissioned officers--played a key role in repulsing three dismounted enemy cavalry brigades under overall command of Major General John S. Marmarmaduke, and consisting of Joseph (Jo) Shelby's \\"Iron Brigade,\\" a second brigade under Colonel Colton Greene and a third brigade commanded by Brigadier General Lucius \\"Marsh\\" Walker. The rebel brigades attempted to seize Battery A--one of four huge reinforced redoubts armed with heavy siege guns along the crest of Crowley's Ridge, immediately west of the town of Helena. The 36th won high praise from both their brigade commander, Brigadier General Samuel Rice and the overall Helena garrison commander, General Frederick Salomon, for their action which culminated with a final advance of 9 companies from Battery A northeastward to clear Shelby's and Greene's troops from hills beyond and re-establish the 36th Iowa's picket positions that were overrun at 3 a.m. Union casualties at Helena were relatively light compared to those of General Theophilus Holmes' rebel command which suffered some 700 killed, an equal number wounded and nearly 1,000 taken prisoner. In the first half of April 1864 during the Camden Expedition to cooperated with the forces of Major General Nathaniel Banks on the Red River, in Louisiana, Drake was directed by 2nd Brigade / Third Division / VII Army Corps commander William McLean to establish a beachhead on the south bank of the Little Missouri River to enable the rest of the VII Army Corps to cross there and bypass heavy concentrations of the enemy guarding the Military Road river crossing at Antoine, 15 miles upriver in hopes of using this alternate route to outflank the rebel army under overall command of Sterling Price and advance onto Prairie D'Ane. On the morning of April 3, Drake took three companies of the 36th Iowa (A, D, G) three companies of the 43rd Indiana, 2 dismounted companies of the 1st Iowa Cavalry and a two-gun section of the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery--less than 500 troops in all--to established an advance picket post in very dense woods in the Little Missouri bottom, a mile south of the river. Drake's small command engaged enemy scouts observing the Federals in small skirmishes throughout the day as the rebel scouts bought time awaiting reinforcement from Marmaduke. At first light on April 4, an estimated 2,500 dismounted enemy cavalry belonging to Marmaduke's division attacked Drake's forward position in the Battle of Elkins' Ferry. In a battle that lasted 7 hours, Drake's small command was steadily driven back toward the Little Missouri but he managed to stop the enemy assault, enabling the remainder of General Frederick Steele's VII Army Corps to cross the river there and advance to a showdown with Major General Sterling Price at the subsequent Battle of Prairie D'Ane, April 10-12. There Steele routed the enemy, driving them southwest to the Confederate state capital-in-exile at Washington, Arkansas. On April 15 the Union VII Corps advanced into Camden Arkansas largely unopposed, in search of supplies, and Drake again showed his talent when he was assigned with just 5 companies of the 36th Iowa and two artillery pieces to hold open a critical crossroads (\\"Camden Crossroads\\") ten miles west of the city for 5 hours until early evening when the Frontier Division of General John Thayer caught up with Steele's advanced column. The Union VII Corps occupied Camden from 15‚Äì26 April. Up to that time, Camden was the Headquarters of Price's Confederate Army of Arkansas. Steele found insufficient rebel food stocks there, requiring him to dispatch forage trains and send supply trains to Pine Bluff. 80 miles northeast across desolate country. On 22 April 1864 a second such supply train was organized and, with 2nd Brigade commander McLean and the colonels of the 36th Iowa, 43rd Indiana and 77th Ohio all on the sick list, command of the 2nd Brigade devolved on Lieutenant Colonel Drake, who was ordered to take the brigade as escort for a 240-wagon supply train to Pine Bluff and to return with rations and other supplies. It was considered a high-risk but essential mission, as VII Corps had exhausted its rations and the troops at Camden were surviving on raw ears of corn or cornbread--if they were lucky. Departing with the train on April 23, Drake encamped 18 miles east of the city on the first afternoon. Drake's cavalry screen skirmished with Shelby's scouts along the way. On the second afternoon, a Sunday, Drake and the wagon train camped on the west bank of the nearly impassible Moro Bayou. Getting underway again before daylight on Monday, April 25, 1864, as the first of the train emerged from the rutted and soggy trail across the Moro, Drake's command was ambushed by some 7000 dismounted rebel cavalry under the command of General James Fagan at a lonely cross-roads known as Marks Mills. In this desperate fight that ended in hand-to-hand close quarters combat, Drake led a spirited defense and was severely wounded, finally falling from his horse due to lack of blood and was captured, along with the entire brigade, save a handful who managed to escape back to Union lines. Despite the fearsome odds, the Federals held Fagan's command at bay for fully 5 hours, before two brigades under General Jo Shelby--including his \\"Iron Brigade\\"-- held in reserve for four hours--finally charged into the Union left flank, encircling the Federals and cutting them off from reinforcements that were following some 20 miles to the west. Badly wounded by a Minie ball that struck his hip and broke into three large fragments that traveled into his leg and knee, Drake awoke after the battle to find General James Fagan standing over him. Fagan ensured that Drake was personally attended to by his own surgeon and a few days later Fagan provided an ambulance to transport Drake from a makeshift field hospital to the nearby home of a southern Doctor and his wife who provided more comfortable and personalized care. Fagan also took the chivalrous step of personally paroling Drake and a few other wounded 36th Iowa officers so they could return to Union lines at Little Rock for proper medical treatment. This was despite Ulysses S. Grant's recent April 17, 1864 ban on prisoner exchanges with the Confederates. Meanwhile, some 1200 men of his brigade were captured at Marks' Mills and force-marched to the notorious prison stockade at Camp Ford, Tyler, Texas where they would remain in horrid conditions until late February 1865. Upon recovering from his wound at his home in Blakesburg, Iowa, Drake returned to Little Rock on crutches. He was appointed President of the Military Commission of Arkansas--then the most powerful military court in the state. In December 1864, Drake, already nominated for promotion to brigadier, preferred charges against his commanding officer, Colonel Charles W. Kittredge resulting in Kittredge's Court Martial, conviction and dismissal from service for drunkenness and conduct unbecoming an officer. On the promotion list for brigadier from October 1864, Drake was appointed Brevet Brigadier General in late February 1865. He meanwhile joined the 36th Iowa on outpost duty at St. Charles, on the White River from March until August, 1865. Meanwhile, the prisoners captured at Marks Mills who survived the horrors of Camp Ford were paroled in late February, and after 30 days home leave, reunited with the rest of the regiment (just 238 officers and men organized into three mixed companies) at St. Charles. The war in the east was winding down but Confederates in Arkansas and Texas refused to consider surrender and both Confederate military and civil authority in southern Arkansas descended into complete anarchy as many former regular Confederate officers transformed their units into raiding guerrilla bands, bushwhackers and freebooters, hitting Federal outposts on the White and Arkansas Rivers. Despite the reunification of the 36th Iowa, by late April morale was low as the troops at St. Charles waited at the remote outpost to be discharged. Upon Drake's arrival to assume command he enforced discipline and ordered the regiment to begin constructing log barracks for a proper garrison. While this angered many of the regiments veterans the activity kept them occupied and in physical shape, while they awaited word of their discharge. On June 11, 1865 - Drake assumed command of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, 7th Army Corps. He was finally mustered out of service in August 1865 as a U.S. Army Brigadier General, U.S. Volunteers; his old 36th Iowa Infantry Regiment - which was now part of his new command - was mustered out of Federal service on August 24, 1865 at DeValls Bluff, Arkansas, transported to Davenport Iowa, and discharged from state service. After the war, Drake practiced law for about six years as a criminal lawyer. Then for almost 30 years, he worked at banking and building and managing railroads. He was president of the Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad, the Indiana, Illinois and Iowa Railroad and the Albia and Centerville Railroad. He organized the Centerville National Bank, of which he was president until his death. On July 17, 1895, he was nominated by the Republican Party for governor of Iowa. He was elected governor by an overwhelming majority on November 5, 1895, serving 1896 through 1898. He founded and endowed Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. It was named after him, and he served as president of the board of trustees. He also contributed to other colleges and gave to churches and missionary societies of many creeds. He died in Centerville, Iowa, in 1903, and is buried in Centerville‚Äôs Oakland Cemetery.

Career As the founder and director of the Emerald Hill Theatre Company in Melbourne, Victoria, Cherry gained a reputation in the early 1960s for innovative programming and bold productions, particularly of Australian plays. Along with George Whaley, he experimented with different acting forms and approaches to theatre.Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director. University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p12. He was also a champion of Bertolt Brecht, both his plays and his contributions to theatre theory (especially the so-called \\"alienation effect\\" or Verfremdungseffekt). When Flinders University was set up in Adelaide, South Australia in 1967, Cherry was appointed to the Foundation Chair of Drama, the first such appointment at an Australian university. In its first year, the fledgling Drama Department at Flinders had a staff of only two (Cherry and ex- ABC Radio man George Anderson), but Cherry's energy and high-profile drove significant expansion, and by the mid-1970s, the department had over a dozen staff, teaching Drama as both an academic discipline, and as training for professional careers in theatre and film, a unique approach at the time. When Flinders established its first on-campus student accommodation, the \\"Hall of Residence\\", Cherry was appointed Dean, and lived in the Hall. While at Flinders, Cherry continued his contribution to professional Australian theatre off-campus. He was a key member of the board of the nascent State Theatre Company of South Australia (SATC). In that position, he drove significant changes in the direction of the company, but his objective of a continuing close link between the SATC and the Flinders Drama Department was never realised. He also continued to direct for various companies, including a notable production of Jean-Paul Sartre's Kean for the SATC in 1970. On-campus, in 1971-2 he wrote and directed a play, Horrie's Alibi, with a student cast augmented by a number of professional actors. This production also toured Israel, playing at a number of kibbutzim as a cultural exchange under the auspices of the Israeli government. In 1980, Cherry took up an appointment as Chairman of the Theater Department and Professor of Theater at Temple University, Philadelphia. Cherry died in Boston in 1986. Legacy In his memory, the highly regarded Wal Cherry Award is given annually for new Australian playwriting. Flinders University holds a biennial Wal Cherry lecture with the first lecture being given in 2006 by Dr Noni Hazlehurst AM (herself a graduate of Cherry's Flinders course) and the second in 2008 by Dr Robyn Archer AO.

He was signed by the Kansas City Athletics as an amateur free agent before the 1959 season and pitched for the Kansas City A's (1963‚Äì1965), Cleveland Indians (1966‚Äì1967), Baltimore Orioles (1968), Seattle Pilots (1969), Milwaukee Brewers (1970), and Montreal Expos (1970‚Äì1971). During a nine-year major league career, O'Donoghue compiled 39 wins, 377 strikeouts, and a 4.07 earned run average. At the plate, he was 35-for-206 (.170) with 3 home runs, the first two against Buster Narum and the third off Denny McLain. Playing career O'Donoghue was primarily a starting pitcher during the first half of his major league career, and almost exclusively a reliever during the second half. From 1963‚Äì1967, he started in 93 of his 139 games, and from 1968‚Äì1971 relieved in 115 of his 118 games. He struggled greatly during his first four minor league seasons (1959‚Äì1962), from rookie ball to Double-A. He had a combined record of 26‚Äì39 with an earned run average of 5.54. In 499 innings pitched he had given up 307 earned runs, struck out 360, and walked 358. In 1963, at the age of 24, it all began to come together. Pitching in the Eastern League and Pacific Coast League, he had a combined record of 14‚Äì11 with an ERA of 3.10, leading to his call-up to the pitching-starved Athletics. O'Donoghue made his major league debut on September 29, 1963, the last day of the regular season. He was the starting pitcher in a home game against the Cleveland Indians at Municipal Stadium. He gave up just two runs (one unearned) in six innings, but was the losing pitcher as Jim \\"Mudcat\\" Grant and the Tribe prevailed, 2‚Äì1. His first major league career win came on May 12, 1964 at Dodger Stadium. He started and pitched the first seven innings against the Los Angeles Angels, giving up two unearned runs, and the A's won by a score of 6‚Äì2. John Wyatt saved the game for him with two scoreless innings. O'Donoghue's finest major league effort was against the Detroit Tigers on August 19, 1967. He pitched a one-hit complete game shutout at Tiger Stadium that day, striking out 11 and walking only 2. The Tigers had such players as Dick McAuliffe, Al Kaline, Willie Horton, Bill Freehan, Eddie Mathews, and Norm Cash in the lineup, but O'Donoghue was almost untouchable. Freehan got the only Tiger hit, a 2nd- inning single, as the Indians won 5‚Äì0. Even though O'Donoghue was named to the American League All-Star team in 1965, it probably does not qualify as his best season. He was 9‚Äì18 with a 3.95 ERA; the 18 losses tied him for the league lead with Boston Red Sox pitchers Bill Monbouquette and Dave Morehead. In 1967, he compiled an 8‚Äì9 record with a 3.24 ERA and had his lowest career WHIP (1.171). Then, in 1969, he relieved in 55 games for the Seattle Pilots and compiled a 2‚Äì2 record with 6 saves and a 2.96 ERA in 70 innings. O'Donoghue was traded along with Gordon Lund by the Indians to the Baltimore Orioles for Eddie Fisher and minor leaguers Johnny Scruggs and Bob Scott on November 28, 1967.Joyce, Dick. \\"L.A.

In humans, the hemojuvelin protein is encoded by the HFE2 gene. Hemojuvelin is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule family of proteins. Both RGMa and RGMb are found in the nervous system, while hemojuvelin is found in skeletal muscle and the liver.  Function  For many years the signal transduction pathways that regulate systemic iron homeostasis have been unknown. However it has been demonstrated that hemojuvelin interacts with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), possibly as a co-receptor, and may signal via the SMAD pathway to regulate hepcidin expression. Associations with BMP2 and BMP4 have been described. Mouse HJV knock-out models confirmed that HJV is the gene responsible for juvenile hemochromatosis. Hepcidin levels in the liver are dramatically depressed in these knockout animals. A soluble form of HJV may be a molecule that suppresses hepcidin expression. RGMs may play inhibitory roles in prostate cancer by suppressing cell growth, adhesion, migration and invasion. RGMs can coordinate Smad-dependent and Smad-independent signalling of BMPs in prostate cancer and breast cancer cells. Furthermore, aberrant expression of RGMs was indicated in breast cancer. The perturbed expression was associated with disease progression and poor prognosis.  Related gene problems  *TAR syndrome *1q21.1 deletion syndrome *1q21.1 duplication syndrome  Gene structure and transcription  RGMc/HJV is a 4-exon gene in mammals that undergoes alternative RNA splicing to yield 3 mRNAs with different 5‚Äô untranslated regions (5‚ÄôUTRs). Gene transcription is induced during myoblast differentiation, producing all 3 mRNAs. There are three critical promoter elements responsible for transcriptional activation in skeletal muscle (the tissue that has the highest level of RGMc expressesion per weight), comprising paired E-boxes, a putative Stat and/or Ets element, and a MEF2 site, and muscle transcription factors myogenin and MEF2C stimulate RGMc promoter function in non-muscle cells. As these elements are conserved in RGMc genes from multiple species, these results suggest that RGMc has been a muscle-enriched gene throughout its evolutionary history. RGMc/HJV, is transcriptionally regulated during muscle differentiation.  Isoforms  Two classes of GPI-anchored and glycosylated HJV molecules are targeted to the membrane and undergo distinct fates. * Full-length HJV is released from the cell surface and accumulates in extracellular fluid, where its half-life exceeds 24 hours. There appears to be two potential soluble isoforms and two membrane-associated isoforms. * The predominant membrane-associated isoform, a disulfide-linked two-chain form composed of N- and C-terminal fragments, is not found in the extracellular fluid, and is short-lived, as it disappears from the cell surface with a half-life of < 3 hours after interruption of protein synthesis. RGMc appears to undergo a complex processing that generates 2 soluble, single-chain forms, and two membrane-bound forms found as a (i) single-chain, and (ii) two-chain species which appears to be cleaved at a site within a partial von Willebrand factor domain. Using a combination of biochemical and cell-based approaches, it has demonstrated that BMP-2 could interact in biochemical assays with the single-chain HJV species, and also could bind to cell-associated HJV. Two mouse HJV amino acid substitution mutants, D165E and G313V (corresponding to human D172E and G320V), also could bind BMP-2, but less effectively than wild-type HJV, while G92V (human G99V) could not. In contrast, the membrane-spanning protein, neogenin, a receptor for the related molecule, RGMa, preferentially bound membrane-associated heterodimeric RGMc and was able to interact on cells only with wild-type RGMc and G92V. These results show that different isoforms of RGMc/HJV may play unique physiological roles through defined interactions with distinct signaling proteins and demonstrate that, in some disease-linked HJV mutants, these interactions are defective.  Structure  In 2009, the Rosetta ab initio protein structure prediction software has been used to create a three- dimensional model of the RGM family of proteins., In 2011, a crystal structure of a fragment of hemojuvelin binding to neogenin was completed showing similar structures to the ab initio model and further informing the view of the RGM family of proteins.  Mechanism of action  Furin-like proprotein convertases (PPC) are responsible for conversion of 50 kDa HJV to a 40 kDa protein with a truncated COOH-terminus, at a conserved polybasic RNRR site. This suggests a potential mechanism to generate the soluble forms of HJV/hemojuvelin (s-hemojuvelin) found in the blood of rodents and humans.  Clinical significance  Mutations in HJV are responsible for the vast majority of juvenile hemochromatosis patients. A small number of patients have mutations in the hepcidin (HAMP) gene. The gene was positionally cloned. Hemojuvelin is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, and to a lesser extent in the liver. One insight into the pathogenesis of juvenile hemochromatosis is that patients have low to undetectable urinary hepcidin levels, suggesting that hemojuvelin is a positive regulator of hepcidin, the central iron regulatory hormone. As a result, low hepcidin levels would result in increased intestinal iron absorption. Thus, HJV/RGMc appears to play a critical role in iron metabolism.

The remainder of the park's are on the east bank of the river. It is noted for its numerous white-tailed deer and large eastern hemlock trees. The park is located just north of Cornell in Chippewa County in the Northern Highland region of Wisconsin. The Old Abe State Trail begins in the park and follows the riverbank south to the town of Chippewa Falls, with access to Lake Wissota State Park. Natural history Brunet Island is formed by the confluence of the Chippewa and Fisher Rivers. Backwater channels at the north end of the island create several undeveloped islets. The regional landscape was strongly marked by glaciation during the Wisconsin glaciation. The park is forested with mature eastern hemlocks. Deer, overpopulated on the island, eat most of the young hemlocks. In time red pines and spruces may become dominant. Small fenced plots are scattered throughout the island to protect saplings and undergrowth from the deer. In 1977, a tornado touched down on the north-central part of the island, leveling . The tornado left so much debris that the park was closed until spring 1978 for cleanup. Today, this area is regenerating with birch trees. Cultural history The park is named after Jean Brunet (1791‚Äì1877), an upper-class French immigrant who was instrumental in the development of the upper Chippewa River. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1818 and found employment with a trading company. Two years later his employers stationed Brunet in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where he became a leading citizen, married, and eventually went into business for himself. Brunet formed interests in the Chippewa River Valley and moved to Chippewa Falls in 1828. There he was engaged to oversee the construction of the first dam and sawmill on the Chippewa River, which opened the region up to logging. Brunet and his wife, who were childless, took a liking to Francis Gauthier, a boy who worked for him, and treated him as an adopted son for the rest of their lives. In 1837 and 1838 Brunet served on the Wisconsin Territory legislature. Shortly thereafter Brunet moved upriver where he settled permanently. He engaged in trade with native people and ran a popular inn. The city of Cornell was originally called Brunet Falls in his honor. The state acquired Brunet Island in 1936 when it was donated by Northern States Power (now Xcel Energy). The Civilian Conservation Corps built a log shelter in 1938 as the park was developed, and Brunet Island State Park officially opened two years later.

The station is served by eleven weekday round trips on the Metrolink Ventura County Line, five daily round trips of the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner, and one daily round trip of the Amtrak Coast Starlight. The station was served (as Panorama City) by the short-lived CalTrain service in 1982-83. Service was restored with the Amtrak San Diegan in 1988, and Metrolink service began in 1992. History The 1995-built station structure Panorama City station opened with the inauguration of CalTrain on October 18, 1982. The short-lived service ended on March 1, 1983. Amtrak service to Van Nuys (the former CalTrain station) began on June 26, 1988, when one San Diegan round trip was extended to Santa Barbara. Metrolink began Ventura County Line service with a stop at Van Nuys on October 26, 1992. A modern glass-and-concrete Van Nuys station building, funded by Caltrans, opened on December 18, 1995. The station originally had a single side platform serving the southern track of the two-track Ventura Subdivision. (A third track to the north is part of the Union Pacific Railroad Gemco Yard. In January 2018, Metrolink began construction of an island platform - which serves both main tracks - and a pedestrian underpass. Original plans called for a second side platform instead, but the island platform design had fewer impacts. The project was originally to be completed in late 2019, but was not officially finished until January 2020. Future Van Nuys is expected to be expanded in the coming years to provide more connectivity through the Valley and the rest of Los Angeles County. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority East San Fernando Valley Transit Corridor light rail line runs adjacent to the station and the agency is planning a stop near Keswick Street to provide an interchange between systems. A new island platform in the median of Van Nuys Boulevard is expected to open for service in 2028. That line's maintenance and storage facility is additionally planned to be located nearby. This is the northernmost station of the further planned Sepulveda Pass Transit Corridor. new subway or aerial platforms are planned to be built at Van Nuys for the service.

Today, the Vienna U-Bahn lines U4 and U6 and the Vienna S-Bahn (rapid transit) run on its former lines. The name derives from the usage of the term around the turn of the 19th/20th century to denote a full-scale railway in an urban area, separated from all other forms of traffic. It is not related to the usage of the term Stadtbahn in post-World War II Germany. The Stadtbahn is one of Vienna's better-known examples of early Art Nouveau architecture. Its most famous buildings are the two former station entrances on Karlsplatz, now used as a caf√© and a museum respectively, and the Hofpavillon, a station built specifically for Emperor Franz Joseph, located at the eastern end of Hietzing station. Other preserved historical stations are the elevated stations along the G√ºrtel and in some of the suburbs.  History  Opening of the Wiener Stadtbahn (postcard 1898) Before electric cars, ca. 1910 Wien River and Stadtbahn, on L√§ngenfeldgasse (street) Starting position In the middle of the 19th century, one railway line ran from Vienna in each direction. These were the northern line opened in 1837, the southern line opened in 1841, the eastern line opened in the same year, and the western line opened in 1858. In 1870, 1872 and 1881 the Franz- Josefs-Bahn, the Nordwestbahn and the Aspangbahn were added. Each of the seven routes belonged to a different railway company and each had its own train station in the capital, which were, partly for reasons of space, taxation and the military, built far from the city centre, at that time still an undeveloped area. Moreover, six of them were designed as terminal stations, which were hard to expand, and only the last-opened station, Aspang, was already a through station from the beginning. While the comparatively few passengers who did not have the capital as a starting point or destination were able to switch between the stations via the Vienna tramway, which was set up in 1865, this was much more difficult for transit freight traffic. In addition, it became apparent in the late 19th century that the main stations themselves - including the Westbahnhof train station and Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof - urgently needed to be relieved. In the long run, they no longer met the complicated demands of parallel long-distance and local traffic and would have to be rebuilt without the construction of a metropolitan railway. While the rival railway companies at that time had no interest in a central urban solution - the present-day Vienna Central Station finally went into operation in 2012 - the Austrian military, after the March Revolution of 1848, demanded measures to prevent a recurrence of such events. Although the commissioning of the connecting line from 1859, the Donaul√§ndebahn from 1872 and the Donauuferbahn from 1875 provided some relief, the heavy losses of the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz in 1866 showed that further connections between the long- distance railways were needed. After 1867, only 18 kilometers of the Austrian railway network - including the Verbindungsbahn - were in state hands, so in 1874 a renewed nationalization wave began. The de-privatization of operations combined with the new connections in the capital would make it possible, in case of mobilization - especially in case of a two-front war - to move troops, weapons and ammunition more easily. But also the so-called Approvisionierungsverkehr - that is, the supply of the city and the soldiers with food - played a major role in the future of the Vienna Stadtbahn. Equally important was the possibility to connect the large inner-city barracks to the main lines in the event of war, including, in particular between 1849 and 1856, the Arsenal, built as a consequence of the March Revolution. Another important aspect of the construction of the Stadtbahn was the demolition of the Linienwalls, a fortification around the Vienna suburbs. It had become militarily obsolete in the middle of the 19th century, which initially led from 1873 to the building of the 75- to 80-meter wide G√ºrtelstra√üe, with the inner belt within the wall and the outer belt running outside the wall. The demolition of the fortifications from 1894 then made room for new urban railway lines. An early alternative term for the Stadtbahn was therefore 'Belt train' or 'Short Belt railway'. At an early stage, it also became apparent that, for synergy reasons, it would make sense to link the Stadtbahn construction with two other major urban projects in the second half of the 19th century. One of these was the Vienna River canalisation, partly underground, and the other was the further extension of the Danube Canal. Both measures were mainly designed for flood protection, with the Danube Canal in the Freudenau also creating a trading and winter harbor, which was also flood- proof. In addition, the Danube Canal also received two collection channels, the left main collecting channel and the right main collecting channel, built in parallel with the Stadtbahn construction in the course of improving canalization in Vienna. The area gained by the straightening of the two rivers could thus be used for the urban railway lines, avoiding the expensive purchase of private land and the demolition of existing buildings. Following experts from London Underground In Vienna, there were very early relevant projects for railway lines in the city. The oldest dates back to 1844, when the engineer Heinrich Sichrowsky designed an atmospheric railway based on the London and Paris models according to the system of George Medhurst and Samuel Clegg. This was to lead from the Lobkowitzplatz below the Vienna Glacis to the Vienna River and to H√ºtteldorf. Finally, in 1849, Julius Pollack suggested that the Vienna Rail Link, which was still in the planning stage at the time, also be operated atmospherically. The next plans followed in connection with the first city expansion in 1850, including one in 1852 preferred by the Vienna Construction Company and the Vienna Bank Corporation project. The second proposal, which had already been worked out in detail, was presented by Count Henckel von Donnersmarck in 1867. In 1869, Baurat Baron Carl von Schwarz finally brought in a third \\"light rail design\\". Thus, a name was fixed for the project, which soon became commonplace. In addition, the term \\"light rail\\" at the latest in 1872 in Berlin was common. Outside the two capitals, however, \\"Stadtbahn\\" established itself at the end of the 19th century rather as an alternative name for a classic electric tram. In Vienna, as well as in Berlin, one therefore spoke in the 19th century partly of a city railway. Another popular term in Vienna at that time was the Metropolitan Railway, opened in London in 1863, the first subway in the world. 1873: The World's Fair As a result, the economic boom from 1871, the idea of a city railway was again on the agenda. As a result of a competition organized by the Ministry of Commerce, 23 new plans were received by March 1, 1873 [10] when Vienna wanted to position itself as a modern city on the occasion of the World's Fair, which opened on May 1, 1873. Among them was, for the first time, a proposal for a pure tunnel railway, submitted by Emil Winkler. His planning was also based on the first systematic traffic census in Vienna. Even then, the ministry expressed the principle that level crossings with existing roads can not be allowed, so that only high, low or gallery railways came into question. As a result of the economic collapse in Vienna in May 1873, interest in the so-called Stadtbahn question dropped again somewhat. Thus, none of the 23 drafts received a concession, although the municipality judged that of the consortium of Count Edmund Zichy, both in terms of the proposed local rail network and the proposed Vienna River canalisation as the most appropriate to the public interest. The project of Zichy and his fellow campaigners Baron Rothschild, Baron von Schey, Baron Carl von Schwarz, Achilles Melingo, Otto Wagner and Georg Scheyer provided an exclusively elevated train network with a central station between Aspern Bridge and Augarten Bridge. From there, the light rail would lead in one direction to Baumgarten on the Westbahn, and in the other, along the Danube Canal to Franz Josefs station and along the existing walls to the Rennweg. Further routes were planned to the Reichsbr√ºcke, Hernals, S√ºdbahnhof, Brigittenau or Floridsdorf. Influence of Berlin After almost ten years without progress, the German capital Berlin finally gave the immediate impetus for a renewed discussion of the Viennese city rail question. [11] As early as 7 February 1882, the Berliner Stadtbahn service began operations, which later served as a model for the Viennese Stadtbahn in several respects. Not only did it use viaducts, but it was also operated by the state railway with steam locomotives and short train sets and joined several previously existing terminal stations with each other. In this context, three new drafts were submitted to the Austrian Government, the first even in the year before the opening of the Berlin plant. This submitted in August 1881 before a consortium of British engineers James Clarke Bunten and Joseph Fogerty, which - as now the thirtieth light rail project in total - led for the first time to the stage of licensing on 25 January 1883. A central station on the Danube Canal as well as a two-track belt railway with branches to all Viennese stations and to Hietzing were planned. The execution of the approximately 13-kilometer-long ring was planned along the Danube Canal and Wien River as an elevated railway on iron viaducts, on the belt partly as a viaduct, partly as an open or covered nick. The branch lines should all be produced as elevated railways, mostly on viaducts. The concession of the two British but was declared by the Austrian government on March 14, 1886 extinguished because the financial proof of the estimated cost of 719 million Austrian crowns could not be provided. In competition with Bunten and Fogerty stood the project submitted in 1883 by the Stadtbauamt for the construction of a light rail in Vienna, which preferred the municipality of Vienna. It should consist of the following three main lines: *a double-track belt line from the S√ºdbahnhof to the connection to the Nordbahn and the Nordwestbahn, for the most part intended as an elevated railway *a central four-track underground, which should open up the inner city as a diameter line in north-south direction *a Wientalline to be built as an elevated railway from the Westbahnhof to the former Schickaneder bridge at today's cereal market In addition, Siemens & Halske submitted the project of a network of electric light rail vehicles for Vienna in 1884. However, the latter was narrow gauge and was therefore not accepted because the competent authorities feared that this could prevent the emergence of other light rail vehicles. Planning For the first time, the Stadtbahn project was made concrete in 1890, when the steam transport company formerly Krauss & Comp. drafts submitted as a basis for the official negotiations, although they have undergone numerous changes during the following years. The reason for the renewed approach to light rail construction was on the one hand the continuing economic upturn in Austria. This led in the years 1889 and 1890 - after a long period of deficit - again to a balanced state budget, in 1891 even a surplus could be achieved. On the other hand, the Lower Austrian Landtag, Vienna at that time still belonged to the province of Lower Austria, in December 1890, the unification of the capital with its suburbs to Greater Vienna. In this second major urban expansion, the new districts 11 to 19 were added to the existing districts 1 to 10, which lost their independence with effect from 1 January 1892. As a result, the city increased from 55 to 179 square kilometers, the population increased from 800,000 to 1,300,000. Due to the grown city, the Stadtbahn project continued to gain in urgency. At the same time, the western expansion of the city required the expansion of the Stadtbahn project to take into account the newly incorporated municipalities from the beginning. So the planners added the so-called suburb line to the project, even though the namesake suburbs now also all belonged directly to the city. However, as early as 1880, MEP Dr. Wilhelm Exner, the then representative of these communities in parliament, the construction of the suburban line. Finally, in the later k.k. Railway Ministry, which until 1896 was still part of the Ministry of Commerce, held from October 5 to November 16, 1891 an enquete. It turned out that the decision to build would only be made jointly by the state, the state and the municipality. The Ministry therefore proposed the creation of a joint commission. In agreement with the Province of Lower Austria and the City of Vienna, the Government of Prime Minister Eduard Taaffe therefore presented to the Imperial Council on 6 February 1892 a comprehensive bill on the execution of the traffic facilities in Vienna, in which the urban railway lines were fixed. These assumed both houses of the Reichsrat and announced it as law of July 18, 1892. [14] [15] The merit of this is due first and foremost Heinrich Ritter von Wittek, 1897-1905 k.k. Railway Minister. Commission f√ºr Verkehrsanlagen (1892) On July 25, 1892 constituted, as proposed by the Ministry of Railways in the previous year, the so-called commission for traffic in Vienna. In it, the imperial-royal government, represented by the Ministry of Commerce, the Municipality of Vienna, the State of Lower Austria and the Vienna Danube Regulatory Commission were equally represented, with only unanimous decisions were provided. Specifically, the new committee had the task of coordinating the following three planning authorities: *Tracing Bureau of the k.k. General Inspection of the Austrian Railways, responsible for the Stadtbahn *City Construction Office of the Municipality of Vienna, responsible for the regulation of Vienna River *Danube regulation commission, responsible for the construction of the Danube Canal, including collecting channel production Consequently, the Commission was not only responsible for light rail construction, but also acted as the builder for the two parallel river settlement projects, most of which were to be paid by the municipality of Vienna. On October 27, 1892, the ministerial decision was made, whereby the route of all lines was approved. As a result, the Commission decided on 28 November 1892 to begin the Stadtbahn with the suburban line in Heiligenstadt. On 18 December 1892, she finally received the official concession for the operation of the light rail. The construction itself, on the other hand, was transferred to the State Railways. Construction begins Ultimately, the suburban line, which has in places the character of a mountain railway, the most difficult section and was therefore set back a little. In the incisions there, the fine sands turned into the Tegel proved to be floating sands, and even in the case of the Great Turkish Schanzen Tunnel the mountain pressure caused great difficulties in advancing in the insufficiently drained Sarmatian sands. Thus, the breakdown of the tunnel was delayed until the summer of 1895. For the suburb line was already on 1 August 1892 k.k. Chief engineer Albert Gatnar has been appointed as site manager, while for the waist line k.k. Chief Architect Anton Millemoth and for the Wientallinie and the Danube Canal Line k.k. Oberbaurat Professor Arthur Oelwein were responsible. Thus began the light rail construction work on 16 February 1893 with the waist line in Michelbeuern. Previously, however, was begun on November 7, 1892 by a groundbreaking ceremony with the removal of the water reservoir of the former Kaiser-Ferdinand water pipe in front of the Western Railway. Thus, this day can already be regarded as the start of construction. The construction of the suburban line finally began in December 1893, when the substructure work for the section Heiligenstadt-Gersthof was commissioned and started in the same month. By the end of 1894, the sections Heiligenstadt-Westbahnhof, Heiligenstadt-Hernals and H√ºtteldorf-Hacking-Hietzing were under construction. 1895 followed the upper Wientallinie, 1896 finally also the lower Wientallinie. The last step was the construction of the Danube Canal Line on January 13, 1898, whereby no separate date has been handed down for the connecting sheet - which was erected along with it. In advance, the commission had to acquire numerous plots of land ranging in size from a minimum of eight square meters to a maximum of 35,700 square meters. Depending on the situation, the compensation varied between two and a half and 153 Austrian guilders per square meter. In 436 cases succeeded in an amicable agreement with the previous owners, only in 22 other cases had to be forcibly appropriated by court decision. However, the value of the houses and land along the train by their construction increased significantly, that is, the light rail - which caused this increase in value - had to pay in the redemption itself, the higher prices. Even individual buildings had to give way to the light rail. Among them, for example, in 1893 one of the line chapels on the belt, the so-called bridge chapel. Alternatively, Otto Wagner built in the immediate vicinity of the old site from 1895, the St. John Nepomuk Chapel, it was consecrated in 1897. In general, the light rail took considerable influence on the streets and squares in their neighborhood as well as the economic conditions of the affected districts. Thus, for example, the already existing G√ºrtelstra√üe was freed from the many salient old buildings and erected on their mirror grounds, where previously stored behind wooden crates and dilapidated fences, construction materials, stones, scrap iron and the like, the city railway arches. The remaining part of the belt mirror was then transformed into gardens. The new inner-city transport network of the capital was considered a state-owned prestige object of Cisleithania, which is why the state guaranteed all necessary funds and thus made a speedy realization possible. In addition, cheap workers from all over the monarchy were available; At times, up to 100,000 people were at the same time in use. Among them were mainly Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, Slovenians, Lower Austrians and Styrians, to a lesser extent workers from other parts of Austria-Hungary and even from abroad, including from France and Greece. The local railways are rescheduled to main railways, the inner ring line is omitted (1894) The steam tramway company formerly Krauss & Comp applied for the concession of the three sections of the first construction section to be operated as local railways. She hoped thereby a link with the already operated by her routes to M√∂dling in the south and Stammersdorf in the north, but could not prove the necessary funds. As early as January 16, 1894, therefore, decided all three curia of the Commission for traffic systems unanimously, even run the local rail lines themselves. Thereupon the state railway received finally by highest decision of 3. August 1894 also the concession for the Wientallinie and the Donaukanallinie transferred. The two routes then had to be re-planned and ultimately went into operation as main railways. In return, the steam tramway company suffered through the rescheduling a disadvantage. Because in order to clear the construction field for the light rail, they had to shut down their - only on December 22, 1886 opened - December 3, 1886 - 3.21 km long section Hietzing-Sch√∂nbrunner line and also build a new terminus in Hietzing. Furthermore, in 1894, the H√ºtteldorf-Hacking-Hietzing section, which was not originally planned in the first construction phase, was preferred in 1894 in order to link the Wientallinie with the Westbahn. This in turn was the Nebenast Westbahnhof-Penzing the belt line obsolete and disappeared from the planning. However, because the suburban line should nevertheless receive a connection in the direction of Innere Stadt, a second pair of tracks had to be laid between Penzing and H√ºtteldorf-Hacking parallel to the existing Westbahn for the light rail. Thus, the station H√ºtteldorf-Hacking took over - actually intended for the station Penzing - node function in the western city. Also in 1894 newly included in the planning was a connecting curve between the stations Gumpendorfer road and Meidling main road. It should allow, despite the canceled track triangle at the Westbahnhof, direct train services between the belt line and the Westbahn. The third local railway of the first construction phase, the inner ring line, was completely discarded in 1894. Although it should continue to be reserved for a private railway, the concession should be granted only if the route could be carried out with electrical operation. Ultimately, this compound, with some similar route, only in 1966 initially as Unterpflasterstra√üenbahn in the course of the so-called two-line, which eventually mutated in 1980 to the U2. Financial reasons in 1895-1896 The reorganization of the Wientallinie and the Donaukanal line from subordinate local railways to fully developed main railways complicated and made the project considerably more expensive. Due to the architectural quality demanded by Otto Wagner, the buildings of the more important routes were much more expensive than planned before 1894. [25] Thus moved the second phase of construction in the distance. In addition, on 11 July 1895, the Commission decided to postpone the Donaustadt line, which was still allocated to the first phase of construction, and for which to date 264,915 Austrian crowns have been incurred for preparatory work, projection costs and land acquisition. This meant that the four intermediate stations planned on this route, Kronprinz-Rudolfs-Br√ºcke, Gaswerk, Lederfabrik and Donau-Kaltbad were obsolete. Another concretization of the plans was made by the law of May 23, 1896. In addition, in August 1896 a k.k. Baudirection for the Wiener Stadtbahn as a separate department in the Ministry of Railways was called into being and Friedrich Bischoff von Klammstein appointed as Baudirektor or section chief, she replaced the then disbanded Directorate General of k.k. State Railways. From Klammstein were under three construction management, that is, the suburb line, the belt line and the Wientallinie each formed a lot. The various construction managements together employed about 70 civil servants, including 50 technicians. As lecturers for substructure, superstructure, building construction and material management of this building management k.k. Baur√§the Hugo Koestler, Christian Lang, Joseph Zuffer and Alexander Linnemann. The Department of Basic Redemption led the k.k. Hofrath dr. Victor Edler von Pfl√ºgl. The administrative business of the Commission for Traffic Systems was initially headed by the Lieutenant Baron von Hock, later the Lieutenant Governor Lobmeyr. As a technical advisor Ministerialrat Doppler acted. Also in 1896, the project operators also reduced the planning for the construction of the belt line. It was supposed to lead from the Gumpendorfer Stra√üe station - the wall approaches erected as a preliminary construction work are still visible there today - over the unrealized station Arbeitergasse in the Gaudenzdorfer G√ºrtel / Margareteng√ºrtel area to the Matzleinsdorf freight station of the S√ºdbahn. From there, a continuation over the Laaer Berg to the eastern railway might have been considered. As a problem here proved the not yet nationalized S√ºdbahn-Gesellschaft, whose infrastructure should use the light rail in the so-called P√©age traffic. That's why it was decided at that time: \\"The construction of the Gumpendorferstra√üe-Matzleinsdorf line of the belt line will only be carried out if the relations between the Southern Railway and the State Railways are finally settled.\\" However, the saved connection between Gumpendorfer Stra√üe and Matzleinsdorf threatened to have a negative impact on the future operation, because the belt line from the main customs office station would not have been possible without a change of direction. To compensate for this deficiency, the responsible persons therefore integrated in 1896 at short notice still a connecting curve between the stations Brigittabr√ºcke on the Danube Canal Line and Nu√üdorfer Street on the belt line in the planning. This short crossbar was henceforth usually referred to as a connecting curve or connecting arch, but in some sources is not considered as an independent route, but only as part of the Danube Canal Line. Another saving measure concerned the viaduct arches. In this case, the plaster fa√ßade originally planned by Otto Wagner was dropped. Instead, the - originally light yellow - clinker bricks and the cornices made of solid natural stone masonry are now visible, as was the case previously with the Verbindungsbahn and the Berliner Stadtbahn. Visually, the vaults stood in stark contrast to the white plastered station buildings, except in the light rail, the architect has planned or executed no further brick facades. Construction problems in 1897 While the construction of the suburban line, the upper Wientallinie and the waistline brought only minor difficulties, the lower Wientallinie prepared due to complications in connection with the regulation and partial doming of the Wienflusses much larger problems. So the river often had to be completely relocated to make room for both objects. In some places entire groups of houses were demolished. The construction was the most difficult at those points where the foundations of the city railway walls often reached six to seven meters below the foundations of the old neighboring houses. In addition, the flood events that occurred at that time caused widespread destruction of the buildings in the critical state of foundation and led to construction interruptions. In particular, this was true for the so-called century flood in July 1897. The second major difficulty in the construction of the Wientallinie represented the elaborate reconstruction of the station Hauptzollamt, which alone cost over eight million Austrian crowns. This was done while maintaining the rail traffic to the Vienna Main Customs Office and the wholesale market hall and was associated with time-consuming provisional. The station was originally in high altitude and had to be lowered by 6.82 meters for the light rail, because both adjacent new lines were Tiefbahnen. This project was made even more difficult by the existing connection to the Praterstern, which in turn remained an elevated railway. The lowering of the station main customs office took place with simultaneous increase of four busy roads with altogether approx. 20,000 daily wagons, in particular the Ungargasse, the Landstra√üer main road, the Marxergasse and the rear Zollamtsstra√üe. They crossed under the connecting track before by means of long, hose-like underpasses with only very small passage heights of 3,6, 4,0 and 4,45 meters. For this purpose, a provisional station supported by 3,000 pilots had to be built first. Only then could the demolition of the old station begin, which in turn was connected to a movement of 380,000 cubic meters of earth and stone material, and the new construction of the final station. The transfer of the four above-mentioned streets required the construction of iron bridges in the width of 54.8, 70.2, 92.6 and 63.6 meters, also had existing water pipes and gas pipes with a total length of 2520 meters, various cables with a total length of 3520 meters, 260 meters pipe post pipes and the local main sewer are laid. The outflow of the Wiener Neust√§dter Canal was accomplished by the installation of a siphon. Furthermore, because the main customs office should not lose its siding, there also had to be constructed an electrically operated lift for freight wagons weighing up to 30 tons, with a lifting height of six meters. The wholesale market hall, in turn, received a new siding in a low-lying position, but in order to use it, electric elevators had to be installed in the building. Short-term rescheduling of the Danube Canal Line and the Connecting Arc (1898) Due to local resident protests in the IX. District had to be rescheduled in the course of 1898, and thus in a very late project phase, even the originally intended as elevated rail section Schottenring-Brigittabr√ºcke in a more expensive low-gauge line. However, the associated additional costs of 4.6 million Austrian crowns were borne by the municipality of Vienna by municipal decree of June 1, 1898. By this measure, the opening of the Danube channel line was obsolete before the turn of the century, because the section in question could only in the fall of 1898 tackled while the rest of the Danube Canal Line has been under construction since the beginning of the year. The lowering of the route was also structurally challenging. The reason for this were the foundations of the town-side retaining walls at Morzinplatz and the translation of the Alsbach river. At the Morzinplatz, the workers on the surface initially encountered the old fortification walls, which made it more difficult for the local floating sand to carry out the construction work. Another problem was the recently built right main collecting channel. It was close to the track, but in a higher position than the track, so that its existence would have been endangered at the lowest setting. As a result, neither water could be pumped out of the foundations' pits during the construction of the railway supporting wall, which was to be laid five to six meters below the ground, nor could it be piloted - also because of the vibration. Therefore, cast iron fountain wreaths with a diameter of two meters were sunk, concreted and placed on these walls. The extension of the gallery route along the Danube Canal also affected the connecting arch, which was originally only 850 meters long. Due to the lowering of his starting point, he could no longer take Brigittabr√ºcke to the station Nu√üdorfer Stra√üe, i.e. in place of today's Nordbergbr√ºcke, because otherwise the slope of the ramp to the bridge over the Franz-Josefs-Bahn would have been too strong. Instead, the planners artificially prolonged it to a north-sweeping turn to achieve a more favorable pitch ratio. Thus, however, the already built branch at the station Nu√üdorfer road was useless, this construction advance in the area of the arcs with the numbers 179-184 remained until today. As a substitute the roundabout Nu√üdorfer Stra√üe was built about 300 meters further in the direction of Heiligenstadt. Postponement of the opening date Originally, all routes of the first phase were to go into operation together at the end of 1897. Due to the varying degrees of delays, the client finally waived the simultaneous opening of the entire network. As an alternative, the following completion plan was in effect at the beginning of 1898: *Suburban line until the end of April 1898 *Upper Wientallinie and waistline until June 1, 1898 *Lower Wientallinie and Verbindungsbahn until June 1, 1899 *Danube canal line until the end of 1899 Ultimately, however, the postponed opening date could only be maintained at the top Wientallinie and the waistline, while the other sections delayed even further. The Stadtbahn was built between 1894 and 1901 along with the regulation of the Wien River and the Danube Canal. Only five lines of a much larger planned network were actually constructed: * Wientallinie (Vienna Valley line): H√ºtteldorf-Hacking - Hauptzollamt * Donaukanallinie (Danube Canal line): Hauptzollamt - Heiligenstadt * Line to the 2nd district: Hauptzollamt - Praterstern * G√ºrtel line: Meidling Hauptstrasse - Westbahnhof - Heiligenstadt * Vorortelinie (Suburban line): H√ºtteldorf-Hacking - Ottakring - Heiligenstadt In addition, a brief section of elevated track was built connecting the G√ºrtel and Danube Canal lines between Nussdorfer Strasse and Friedensbr√ºcke stations. Of the lines that were not built, two lines should have crossed the inner city, and one would have extended the G√ºrtel line along the southern G√ºrtel road to S√ºdbahnhof railway station. These would have helped the Stadtbahn be a more appealing and useful transportation system, but financial constraints prevented their construction. The ceremonial opening of the Wiener Stadtbahn took place on May 9, 1898 with the participation of Emperor Franz Joseph I, the Vienna Archbishop Anton Josef Cardinal Gruscha, the Minister of Railways. Heinrich Ritter von Wittek, the Lower Austrian Landmarschall Baron Joseph Freiherr von Gudenus and the Vienna Mayor Karl Lueger in Michelbeuern instead. On that day the monarch drove with the k.u.k. Hofsalonzug, which consisted of his saloon car and three other cars, from there via the belt line to Heiligenstadt, then on the suburban line and the Westbahn to H√ºtteldorf-Hacking, continue on the upper Wientallinie to Meidling Hauptstra√üe and finally on the waist line to the stop Alser street, with which he traveled all sections completed so far. [4] In the last car of the special train, the emperor had an observation platform at his disposal, only there he was spared the smoke of the steam locomotive. From this ceremony the following quotation of the emperor is handed down: \\"Created by the harmonious cooperation of the autonomous Curia and the state, this railway construction will, I hope, bring many advantages to the population and effectively promote the prosperous development of Vienna which is close to my heart.\\" It was one of the first few metros in the world, London Underground (1863), Liverpool Overhead Railway (1893), Budapest Metro (1896) and Glasgow Subway (1896). The other three under construction are Paris Metro (1900), Berlin U-Bahn (1902) and New York City Subway (1904). Integration with Verbindungsbahn The already opened in 1859 section Hauptzollamt Praterstern the Verbindungsbahn - in the context of the Stadtbahn also called Prater line or line in the II district - was thereby the only existing route, which was integrated into the narrower light rail network. On this section, whose infrastructure still belonged to the state railway, Otto Wagner had until 1899 to rebuild the two existing intermediate stops according to light rail standards. This was on the one hand the Radetzkyplatz stop, which stretched between its namesake and the Adamsgasse, and on the other hand the Praterstern stop, which was located on the bridge over the main avenue. The latter was independent of the former North Station, which was 500 meters further north. However, it was also upgraded as the terminus of the light rail in 1899 to a station and made despite the operational separation from the North Station for a better integration desselbigen in local and regional transport. The Radetzkyplatz- Praterstern section with a length of only 533 meters at the same time represented the shortest station distance in the entire Stadtbahn passenger traffic, only the distance between Alser Stra√üe and the freight station Michelbeuern was with 517 meters even shorter. The connection Brigittabr√ºcke- Heiligenstadt, however, was the longest section at 2590 meters. Originally, the connecting line for the light rail was to be upgraded to three tracks. As a result, however, the Helenengasse would have been severely narrowed, on the other hand resisted, so that ultimately only an Ausziehgleis between Hauptzollamt and Radetzkyplatz arose. Regardless, the viaducts had to be rehabilitated and reinforced and the security systems renewed for the dense light rail operation. On the connecting line initially traversed from the lower Wientallinie ago trains tied. From the commissioning of the Danube Canal Line in August 1901, the trains coming from the direction of Meidling Main Street changed then only to a very small part on the Verbindungsbahn, with commuter trains between Hauptzollamt and Praterstern replaced the dropped links, each with a locomotive front and rear were covered. Just a few months after opening, a serious accident occurred on the suburban line, when on 6 January 1899 at 4:00 am the locomotive 30.17 was accidentally led onto a stump track shortly after leaving Heiligenstadt station. The train, which consisted of 85 empty freight cars, then overturned the buffer from Tulln to H√ºtteldorf- Hacking and crashed into Gunoldstra√üe, which ran six to seven meters below. The locomotive driver suffered heavy injuries and the heater suffered minor injuries. Exactly this accident situation at the same place repeated itself on the 20th of February 1928, whereby in turn no casualties were to be lamented. For Stadtbahnungl√ºcke the Viennese Voluntary Rescue Society in the year 1900 specially a special railway ambulance car in enterprise, which was stationed in the station main customs office. The layout of the Vienna railway network was also influenced by its uses for the military which demanded full compliance with mainline railroad rules, steam propulsion and integration with ordinary rail service; this increased costs compared to electrical light rail option. When the lines opened, in four stages between 1898 and 1901, they failed to attract mass riders due to high costs; affluent passengers were discouraged by dirt from engine smokestacks and slow speed. While primarily an urban railway line, some trains continued on the mainlines to the north and west of the city. First electric routes In the years 1901-1902, Siemens & Halske also carried out an experimental operation in Vienna with an electric railcar train between Heiligenstadt and the freight station Michelbeuern, which, however, took place without passengers and was canceled again for financial reasons, Here, the track was provided with a running midway between the rails U-shaped track, which was fed with 500 volts DC. The return of the current was carried by the rails connected with copper bars. The - as in steam operation - up to ten-part sample train consisted of railcar and sidecar, both adaptations of ordinary light rail vehicles were. The former received shunt motors directly mounted on the axles for the test. From these the engineers hoped for the advantages of a simple cruise control as well as a considerable recovery of electrical energy in driving through the numerous downhills of the Stadtbahn. To brake the train was in addition to the normal hand brakes, the continuous air suction brake available. In addition, the engines were equipped with a tram-type short-circuit brake. A second attempt at electrification was made by the Prague-based company K≈ôiz√≠k & Co in the years 1906-1907 between the stations Hauptzollamt and Praterstern. For this purpose, K≈ôiz√≠k built its own substation, which fed the line with two times 1500 volts DC in three-wire arrangement, which in addition to the double-pole overhead line, the rails were needed as a central conductor. As a trial locomotive was a two-axle locomotive with center driver's use, which was designated as Vienna 1 and later to the Czechoslovak state railway ƒåeskoslovensk√© st√°tn√≠ dr√°hy (ƒåSD) arrived. World War I The outbreak of the First World War was a major setback for the light rail. Their entire network was from the general mobilization on July 31, 1914 now actually the troop transport of the military, the civilian passenger transport was henceforth only possible under restrictions. Their military task, however, they could fully meet. As on other rail lines in the country, it came again and again to total settings of regular passenger traffic, so for the first time from 6 August 1914 and again from 26 May 1915. One of the reasons for the restrictions was the lack of staff because more and more employees received their convocation. As a substitute, therefore, women had to be employed on the tram for the first time as of June 1915, as was previously the case with the tram service, but they only took over the station services. However, in order to ensure a quick and smooth transition, the administration hired only the wives and daughters of male employees. In addition, served 461 Stadtbahnwagen, that is slightly more than half of the total inventory, the army. Thus, the Ministry of Railways, at the suggestion of the k.u.k. Ministry of War, alone the Austrian Red Cross twelve patient transport trains formed by light rail vehicles with 25 cars each. These state railway diseases consisted of carriages of the III. Class, they could - on inserted field carriers - 72 Lying and 225-seated wounded transport. The patients were invited through two window openings in the side walls, which were closed by a flap. Less than a month after the end of the war, the light rail had to be imported due to a shortage of coal, which now had to be imported from the war-looted mining districts, on December 8, 1918 almost completely set again. Only the suburb line remained in operation almost throughout, even during and after the war, albeit at times greatly thinned. While in 1907 still 67 trains daily reversed, there were 1917/1918 only 50 trains and 1919 even only 22 trains. Only in 1920, the frequency increased again to 42 trains, 1921 then drove even 54 trains daily. Coal shortage In 1918, services came to a halt due to the coal shortage after World War I. Subsequently, the Wiental, Donaukanal, and G√ºrtel lines were leased by the city of Vienna. They were electrified and reopened in 1925 under the name \\"Wiener Elektrische Stadtbahn\\" (Vienna Electric Metropolitan Railway). As a result of the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy, the dissolution of Austria- Hungary, which took place in the autumn of 1918 and 1919/1920 was confirmed in peace treaties, the state railway lost much interest in the Vienna light rail; even the earlier military considerations no longer mattered. In addition, the Federal Constitution, passed on 10 November 1920, and the divorce law of 29 December 1921 based on it, led to the detachment of the municipality of Vienna from the province of Lower Austria, so that two federal states had to coordinate with each other in light rail traffic into the surrounding area. Due to the new outskirts of Vienna in the fledgling Republic of Austria, the traffic flows had also changed greatly, especially the traffic to the north and east collapsed almost completely. In addition, as a result of the war for the first time ever in history, the population of the capital fell, and the prospect that Vienna would grow to four million inhabitants, was now no longer realistic. Thus, from the point of view of the former operator, no profitable light rail traffic could be expected. Furthermore, the fumes of the steam operation had - as already feared at the opening - especially the reinforced concrete ceilings and metal girders in the tunnel structures heavily added, so that the infrastructure of the light rail was in poor condition after the war. The tunnel ceilings then had to be repaired using the so-called Torkret method, i.e. the use of injection cement. It was not until June 1, 1922 reversed on the upper Wientallinie and the belt line again Stadtbahn trains, as the state railway to relieve the Westbahnhof and the Franz-Josefs-Bahnhofs a so-called reconciliation established in the relation Neulengbach - St. Andr√§-W√∂rdern and thus two Provisionally reinstated routes. However, these trains served on the two reactivated sections only selected intermediate stations, these were under St. Veit Baumgarten, Hietzing, Meidling main street, Gumpendorfer road, stop Westbahnhof, W√§hringer road and Nussdorfer road. As of June 1, 1923, they also stopped in the stations Ober St. Veit and Josefst√§dter Stra√üe, but accounted for the station Nu√üdorfer road. Already on 30 September 1924, this reconciliation traffic ended as a result of the progressing electrification work again. Furthermore, lost as a result of the proclamation of the Republic of German Austria on November 12, 1918, the court pavilion in Hietzing his function and then served for a long time the sculptor Sepp Haberl-Carlo as a studio. The pavilion had previously been used by the Kaiser only twice, on 16 July 1899 to visit the lower Wientallinie and on 12 April 1902 to visit the Danube Canal Line. For his travels, however, he also preferred after the opening of the light rail the nearby station Penzing, for special visitors, the station was frequented again and again. Under the new line scheme, each line was assigned a single letter (D (Donaukanal), G (G√ºrtel) und W (Wienfluss)) which could be combined with other letters to indicate the lines served (like G, GD, DG, and WD). Also notable is line 18G, which was operated until 1945 and ran from Heiligenstadt to Gumpendorfer Strasse station and then along the course of tram line number 18 to Ostbahnhof railway station. Many stations and numerous sections of the lines were destroyed in World War II. Reconstruction of the lines took until 1955, and some of the historic stations were never rebuilt. In 1968 it was decided to integrate the Stadtbahn lines into the city's new subway system. Conversion of line WD to line U4 was completed in 1981; conversion of lines G and GD to line U6 in 1989. Since then, the term \\"Stadtbahn\\" has disappeared from official use. Bridge over the left Wienzeile  Rolling stock  Class N1 Viennese Stadtbahn train, at the Wiental line near Sch√∂nbrunn A special type of steam engine, kkStB class 30, was designed by the Austrian engineer Karl G√∂lsdorf specifically for use on the Stadtbahn. The engine was optimized for quick acceleration, to suit the tight curves and steep inclines of the lines, and to emit a minimum of smoke, which was essential for the tunnel sections. The passenger cars were 2-axle trailers that were rather freely based on a design by Otto Wagner. The new type of rolling stock introduced after electrification was designed so that it could also run on the tramway network. It consisted of 2-axle motor cars (class N), heavy trailers (class n) and light trailers (class n1), which were combined to form trains of up to nine cars in length. These were in operation until 1964. From the mid-1950s onwards, these cars were completely rebuilt using steel frames and new electric equipment. These were referred to as class N1 (motor cars) and class n2 (trailers) and were used well into the 1980s. From 1980 onwards, the class N1 and n2 cars were gradually replaced by new six-axle articulated cars. These are referred to as class E6 (motor cars) and c6 (trailers) and are based on the Duewag \\"Mannheim\\" design. These were in service until the Stadtbahn service officially ended in 1989.  Conversion to U-Bahn Stadtbahn crossing the Stadtbahn bridge over the Wien River in H√ºtteldorf ‚Äì now part of the U-Bahn line U4 After the originally planned by the municipality of Vienna full integration of the light rail into the tram network was still rejected in the course of 1923, was also the Viennese Electric Light Rail, abbreviated W.E.St., formally a classic railway. After comparatively rapid electrification and numerous smaller adaptations, it gradually went into operation between June 3, 1925 and October 20, 1925. From the latter date was also the new community tariff with the tram, which brought the new means of transport economic success. The electrified network was completely separated from the rest of the railway network from 1925 and instead linked to the urban tram network at two points by the mixed operating line 18G. Used - also in the pure light rail traffic - classic two-axle tram cars, which were considered over the decades as a trademark of the electric light rail. For the 450 engines and sidecars purchased at that time, the new operator built three new operating stations in Michelbeuern, Heiligenstadt and H√ºtteldorf-Hacking and hired 823 new employees for the new company branch. The dissolution of the commission for traffic facilities in Vienna in 1934 finally sealed the existence of the original steam railway. As a result, the municipality of Vienna also took over the infrastructure of the electrified network, which was henceforth licensed only as a small train without freight traffic, while the suburban line then completely fell to the state railway. The Second World War hit hard, especially in the last year of the war in 1945, the electric light rail, they could not be completely reactivated until 1954. At the latest in the 1960s, the light rail was subject to a modernization backlog, because the subway planning came at that time only slowly. It was not until 1976 that the first light rail section was converted to subway operation. On October 7, 1989 ultimately received the two belt lines G and GD, the sign of the last two light rail lines ever, the new line signal U6. Thus, apart from the remaining infrastructure, the history of Wiener Stadtbahn ended after more than 91 years. From 1976 onwards, the Stadtbahn was integrated into the newly established Vienna U-Bahn system. For line U4, most of the stations of the Wiental and Donaukanal lines of the Stadtbahn were completely rebuilt. Platforms were raised to and current collection changed from overhead lines to third rail. While some of the station entrances at street level have been preserved, only Stadtpark station remains largely in its original form at platform level. New U-Bahn trains (class U), built by the Austrian manufacturer SGP, were introduced. Line U6, which had been the G√ºrtel line of the Stadtbahn, was left mostly unchanged. The station architecture by Otto Wagner was preserved wherever possible. Only the signalling and electric components have been updated, stations and viaducts have been renovated, and the travel direction was changed from left-hand to right-hand running. A complete conversion of all stations and track to U-Bahn would have been too expensive considering the limited loading gauge offered by the historic lines. The class E6 and c6 Stadtbahn rolling stock remained in service but was phased out by the end of the year 2008 and has since 1995 been complemented and finally replaced by new class T and T1 low-floor rolling stock.  Conversion to S-Bahn  Alserstra√üe station, on the G√ºrtel On the suburban line the regular passenger traffic of the steam railway ended to 11 July 1932, why from 1936 the second track was removed. However, the freight traffic remained. In addition, at least the summer bathing trains to Praterspitz still operated until 27 August 1939, which no longer served the stops Oberd√∂bling and Unterd√∂bling. In addition, they were also important for the 1927 opened Hohe Warte bath and the 1928 congress bath opened. In contrast to the electrified sections of the light rail, the suburban line, which was located away from the important bombing targets, survived the Second World War largely unscathed. In the years 1950 and 1951, for example, it was already possible to travel from the suburban line to spa trains to Kritzendorf and St. Andr√§-W√∂rdern. Subsequently, the track fell increasingly, due to maintenance deficiencies, she was temporarily only passable with a maximum of 25 km / h. This led in 1978 to a temporary ban on passenger trains. Already in 1979, however, the municipality of Vienna, the Austrian Federal Railways and the federal government agreed to a reactivation, this step took place not least in view of the establishment of the Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region (VOR) in 1984. Finally, the suburban line was also electrified with alternating current, expanded to double track again and also switched to right-hand drive. The stations Oberd√∂bling and Breitensee as well as the originally not existing station Krottenbachstra√üe were rebuilt, while the station Unterd√∂bling remained permanently open. On 31 May 1987, passenger services were resumed on the S45 line. In 1993 she was extended from Heiligenstadt to a temporary station at the Floridsdorfer bridge. In 1996, this was abandoned and extended the S45 to the newly built traffic station Handelskai. Initially, the 4020 series was used on the suburban line, which has since been replaced by the 4024 series. The connection to the main customs office at Praterstern remained as part of the connecting railway H√ºtteldorf Hacking north station, starting from 1921 also again with passenger traffic, in continuous operation. It has been part of the S-Bahn trunk line since 1959, the busiest section in the Vienna S-Bahn network, and has been electrified since 1962. Trains of the 4020 and 4024 trains are also used today, as well as the new 4744/4746. However, the station Radetzkyplatz has not been in operation since the interwar period and was demolished after the Second World War. On the Westbahn in turn, the Stadtbahn trains were replaced after the First World War by the so-called Purkersdorfer commuter trains, but only in May 1931 did these begin operation. This shuttle service between H√ºtteldorf-Hacking and Unter Purkersdorf existed until May 27, 1972. In 1944, for example, this relation was listed under the stand-alone Kursbuchtabelle 459e, with a rigid 30-minute cycle over the entire operating time. At times, it even drove every 15 minutes. Meanwhile, the H√ºtteldorf Neulengbach section of the 1952 electrified Westbahn is served by the S50. The Franz-Josefs-Bahn to Tulln is used by the S40 today, this section having been electrified since 1978.  Criticism  The steam operation was heavily criticized from the beginning by both professionals and the population. The concept of a steam-powered subway was already considered technically outdated at its opening in 1898. The only other place with a steam-powered subway was London, apart from the City and South London Railway which had opened in 1890 as an electrified line; all older lines were converted to electric power between 1901 and 1908. By contrast, all other subways worldwide were electric from the outset, or operated as a cableway, as in Glasgow, or as a funicular, as in Istanbul and Lyon. Moreover, the steam railway operation also resulted in the passengers and the train crew on the underground sections being largely unprotected from the smoke. In addition, the soot settled on the seats and soiled them, and thus also the garments of the passengers, even before the journey. In addition, the locomotives also damaged the infrastructure of the railway itself, because the smoke caused the rapid corrosion of the exposed iron structural parts of the superstructure and generated dust that infiltrated the carriages. The problem of rusting intensified due to the water vapour that emanated from the locomotive and in winter from the heating pipes. Due to the dense train sequence in both directions of travel, the resulting strong smoke and steam masses were able to escape the tunnels only very slowly, especially in cloudy and foggy weather. At Ferdinandsbr√ºcke station, the operator even experimented at times with powerful fans to extract the smoke before entering the underground station, but these attempts were unsuccessful. In addition, the white-plastered station buildings in particular discoloured quickly. For example, the facade of the Hietzinger Hofpavillon had to be repaired for the first time just three years after opening, and surrounding buildings were also affected. This problem was particularly evident on the marble statues of the former Elisabeth Bridge. After demolition of the bridge in 1897, they were initially placed at Karlsplatz station. However, they were so quickly polluted that they received the nickname 'The eight chimney sweepers' and had to be transferred to the Rathausplatz in 1902. And having a steam railway right in front of their house was not particularly popular with the local residents either, as the satirical weekly Kikeriki already ridiculed in its opening month of May 1898: \\"How was B. suddenly deaf? He had his window open for half an hour on the Girdle! \\\\- Kikeriki, May 1898 And even the relatively low speed of the steam trains inspired the humorists: \\"Why are you making such a sad sight? I'm from the express train of the Stadtbahn and during the fastest part, my hat, my stick and my glasses fell from the car! So what? And I could only pick up the stick and the glasses! \\" \\\\- Kikeriki, May 1898 The only arguments in favour of steam operation were the lower construction costs and the strategic military function of the rail network. The chosen form of operation seemed more flexible in this respect, as there was no network of electrified railway lines in Central Europe for decades to come.

Colonel John Tayloe II, perhaps the richest Virginia planter of his generation, constructed it. His daughter Rebecca and her husband, Francis Lightfoot Lee, one of the only pair of brothers to sign the Declaration of Independence (Richard Henry Lee being the other brother,) are buried on the estate, as are many other Tayloes. Before the American Civil War, Mount Airy was a prominent racing horse farm, as well as headquarters of about 10-12 separate slave plantations along the Rappahannock River (comprising some 60,000 acres). Mount Airy is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark as well as on the Virginia Landmarks Register, and is still privately owned by Tayloe's descendants.  Architecture  River Facade of Mount Airy, Richmond Co, Virginia Mount Airy is composed of a massive two-story central block above a high basement, long and deep, two curving one-story passageways, and two -square two-story end dependencies set forward.NRHP Inventory, Nomination Form, ¬ß 7, Description The five-part unit, long, encloses three sides of a semi-circular forecourt. This court is raised by a low terrace above the entrance drive and is reached by cut and molded stone steps, flanked by elaborate carved stone vases on pedestals. Set on a ridge, the house commands a wide view of the Rappahannock River Valley. The walls of the central unit are made of dark-brown sandstone, carefully hewn and laid in courses of random height, with architectural trim in light-colored limestone. It is possible that the exterior may originally have been stuccoed though no trace remains. The north or entrance fa√ßade is approached from the forecourt by a flight of steps leading to a recessed loggia, whose square columns, faced with four Roman Doric pilasters, define three rectilinear openings. The projecting central pavilion is of rusticated limestone, with three windows in the second story and a crowning pediment. The south or garden facade is almost identical in composition except that the three entrances in the pavilion are spanned by round arches with heavily marked voussoirs and keystones, and the upper windows are unframed. The other windows are framed by stone architraves and sills, and the limestone belt course and rusticated angle quoins are very prominent. The existing broad hip roof, pierced by four interior chimneys located near the ridge, is a replacement of the original roof, possibly a hip-on-hip that was destroyed by fire in 1844. The south or rear elevation was undoubtedly taken directly from Plate LVIII of James Gibbs' Book of Architecture and the north elevation was less directly derived from a plate of Haddo House in Scotland, shown in William Adam's Vitruvius Scoticus. The two stone two-story dependencies have hipped roofs and central chimneys and their corners are given the same quoin treatment as the main house. The connecting passageways, also of stone, are quadrants covered with shed roofs that are concealed from the north or front. At the junction with the central block, the roofs of the connections are stepped up to allow entrances to the main floor of the house.  Gardens  Mount Airy Buildings and Gardens The shaped terraced levels of its gardens are still clearly visible beneath its modern covering of lawn. Mount Airy has the earliest surviving Orangery in North America. A sustainable, owner-operated, flower farm in Virginia‚Äôs Northern Neck and part of historic Mount Airy Farm occupies the space today. The gardens produce a variety of blooms, herbs, woody ornamentals, & cold season vegetables, for weddings, events, flower bouquets, and floral design.http://mountairy.farm/gardens  History  John Tayloe II painting by John Wollaston (painter) The Tayloe family had owned the land around Mount Airy for over century before Colonel John Tayloe II, a fourth generation tobacco planter, began building a manor house with a commanding view of the Rappahannock River valley as well as westward towards the town of Tappahannock. The project began around 1748 and finished in 1758. Tayloe used reference books of the day to incorporate then-modern and now- classical architectural themes. As discussed below, John Tayloe II also became a distinguished breeder of race horses at this plantation, including: Sir Archy, Selima and Grey Diomed. The original stable and a few outbuildings (including a smokehouse and dairy/ice-house) survive to this day. The house continues occupied by Tayloe family descendants, including Mrs. H. Gwin Tayloe, Jr. (died 3 June 2011) and now John Tayloe Emery, Sr. Col. Tayloe's son-in-law Francis Lightfoot Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, lived nearby, in a house Col. Tayloe built for the young couple, Menokin.NRHP Inventory, Nomination Form, ¬ß 8, Significance Tayloe's daughter and her famous husband are buried in the Tayloe family cemetery, approximately from Mount Airy. John Tayloe II, John Tayloe III (1792-1828) and William Henry Tayloe, operated Mount Airy and it's outlying farms not only as plantations worked by enslaved populations, but a successful horse stud farm. Richard S. Dunn, Harvard University Press, Nov 4, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/books/review/a-tale-of-two-plantations-by- richard-s-dunn.html John Tayloe III also continued his father's building tradition, constructing the Octagon House in the new federal city, Washington, D.C. (which became his winter residence). He also operated an ironworks and shipbuilding facility near Neabsco, Virginia, led a company of dragoons into Pennsylvania to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion, and held various local political offices. John Tayloe II, who established the family's turf-racing business, imported Jenny Cameron, Jolly Roger and Childers to Virginia, three of the most important colonial racing imports. He also owned the winning racehorses Hero, Juniper, Single Peeper, Yorick, Traveller and Nonpareil.John Harding Peach, On the banks of the Rappahannock, (AuthorHouse), page146Blooded Horses of the Colonial Days, Francis Barnum Culver, By the Author, 1922 The first noteworthy colonial horse race was won by Col. Tasker's 6 year old imported mare Selima at Annapolis, Maryland in May 1752. That December, Selima raced in Gloucester, Virginia and beat Col William Byrd's \\"Trial\\", as well as this Col. Tayloe's \\"Jenny Cameron\\" & \\"Childers\\" and Col. Thornton's \\"Unnamed\\". That sweepstakes, in four mile heats and with a purse of 500 pistoles, marks the beginning of the competition between Maryland and Virginia in horseracing. In April, 1766, Col.

It was rebuilt within its shell of brown sandstone with limestone quoins, and using the original floor plan. William Henry, son of John Tayloe III, took over Mount Airy in 1828. Its slave population continued to increase, even as depleted soil led to crop shortfalls and declining profits. He and his brothers responded in part by acquiring cotton fields in west-central Alabama. Between 1833 and 1862, William Henry Tayloe moved a total of 218 slaves (many teenagers) about 800 miles from Virginia to Alabama. Because the trans-Atlantic slave trade nominally closed because Britain ended slavery and because the U.S. Constitution's provisions against slave imports took effect in 1808, Virginia became a net slave exporter within the U.S. Although the U.S. had fewer than a million enslaved people as the 19th century began (mostly concentrated in the coastal and piedmont South), with the invention of the cotton gin and development of internal slave trading, there were four times as many slaves four decades later, working from Charleston to Texas.

Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, BAI also operates Banking Strategies, a daily online financial services publication. Organization BAI's mission is to give financial services leaders confidence, information and resources in order to make smart business decisions, every day. BAI's mission is created on the belief that a strong financial services industry helps consumers, businesses, and communities thrive. BAI's members include national and global banks, credit unions, mortgage and auto loan providers, money service businesses, and larger lending institutions. In 2016, over 250,000 financial services individuals at more than 1,500 financial services organizations took compliance and professional training courses through BAI. History In 1924, several representatives of regional auditors' groups met to discuss issues in the auditing industry. Later that same year they created a national organization‚Äîthe National Association of Bank Auditors and Controllers (NABAC) ‚Äîand began to hold annual conventions and distribute a magazine focused on financial industry topics. In the 1940s, the NABAC established its own office‚Äîfirst in Cleveland and later in Chicago. And the organization began to provide both education and technical research for its members. In 1957, the organization set up the NABAC Research Institute as the first official, collective research effort for the banking industry. In 1969, NABAC rebranded as Bank Administration Institute (BAI), and had approximately 8,000 member institutions across the U.S. In 1981, BAI launched the first electronic information services‚ÄîInnerline‚Äîproviding 24-hour access to world news briefs, American Banker news service, financial information on 8,500 publicly held corporations, and email and online registration for BAI conferences. As of 1997, BAI co-sponsored with ECCHO (Electronic Check Clearing House Organization) the National Electronic Check and Image Exchange Conference. In 2014, BAI recognized 90 years of service to the financial services industry and provided more than 250,000 individuals with compliance and professional training. Business lines BAI is organized into three major divisions: Research, Learning and Development, and Conferences and Events. BAI's Research division conducts data analysis using account-level data provided from participating financial services organizations. Once data is gathered, the data is then analyzed and compiled using BAI's proprietary database. BAI uses the data in order to present individual organizations with a comparison of their data with the larger peer group of participating organizations. All individual company data is kept confidential, and competitive data is available to participating organizations only in aggregate. As a non-profit organization, BAI does not provide advice or consulting as a part of its research services. Comparative data is presented without additional insight or opinion. BAI Research topics include industry trends, small business banking, retail banking, and commercial banking. Analytics that can be compared include deposit performance, forecasts, market opportunities, and branch performance. BAI Learning and Development division maintains a software course catalog through BAI's proprietary learning management system, the BAI Learning Manager, which can be accessed and managed by training administrators. The catalog includes more than 250 courses for banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders, and other financial services organizations. Topics cover areas including financial regulations, compliance, professional skills, certifications, and human resources issues. Courses are available from entry to executive level. BAI's course catalog is regularly updated to reflect the latest regulatory trends and issues in compliance and can also be provided to a financial institution's own learning management platform. BAI compliance and professional training can be customized, is updated continually, and is compliant with national regulatory standards. BAI's Conferences and Events division hosts several industry events with the help of sponsors. Events include a comprehensive banking conference, a global awards program learning conference, executive roundtables, certification programs, and webinars throughout the year. The following are a few of the main events: * BAI Global Banking Innovation Awards: An annual awards program that has operated since 2011, the BAI Global Banking Innovation Awards event recognizes innovators within the financial services industry worldwide.

The idea of the operation was to have a rotational deployment operation to intercept possible drug trafficking aircraft and to control territories where drug traffickers would not be able to smuggle more. The operation was based out of Howard Air Force Base in Panama and was moved all over the Caribbean and Central America. The Commander-in-Chief and US Atlantic Command oversaw this operation and under the guidance of Joint Interagency Task Force East (JITF-E) division, stood alert 24/7 in case the need to identify an unknown aircraft came up. Operation Coronet Nighthawk is credited with over 33,000 metric tons of cocaine being disrupted or seized since 1994. This operation is no longer in use anymore since 2001, but the title was used again in a different operation that took place in Europe soon after it fell apart and incorporated the new stealth jets known as the Nighthawks thus why the name Nighthawk was used again. F-15 plane used during the operation Background In the early 1990s and 1980s, the United States experienced a significant increase in drug trafficking and smuggling. Drugs were being smuggled by boat, car, over the border and even by plane. The US government decide to respond to this with operation Coronet Nighthawk. The title Coronet has been used in the military for many operations dating back to World War II with Operation Coronet which was part of the Japanese downfall where they would land in Japan and await their surrender. A coronet is a small, simple crown and just like many of the coronet operations they were mostly small operations that did not involve much fighting but surveillance and waiting. Nighthawk is an essential word in this operation since it relates to the drug planes that generally flew to the north of South American so they could reach they dropped points when it got dark. This made it difficult for the military to find them and then fly back home in the cover of the night which made it extremely hard for the military to find them. Panama base Before Operation Coronet Nighthawk even began the Air Defense Squad went to an airbase in Panama where at first they would work for two to three months on their night operational skills before deployment. The orders for these pilots were to look for any suspicious planes or even ships and to follow and observe to see if they were making any delivery and if so to follow them back to where they originated from. The Air National Guard would then notify the local authority of the ship or aircraft so that they could then go through with an arrest on the suspects. The requirements to be featured on this mission were centered on the pilot's ability to intercept and shadow boats and planes without being spotted and to avoid flying into another country's airspace. This operation featured two different aircraft at the time the F-15s and F-16s both planes are known for their ability to track and destroy planes and well known for there maneuverability while in the air making then one of the best planes to use in this operation. Most pilots on this operation felt that it was a waste of time and money to be trailing these ships, but it did have its moments of struggle and difficulty. The early and late hours of having to be on the clock twenty-four seven and since most of the time they would fly below clouds they did not have any visual cues while flying. The F-16s were also known for their combat ability, but it was never used since they were not supposed to engage and to support an F-16 is very expensive. All the F-16s in this operation were never armed with any missiles or ammo because of this. Around two F-16s and 53 pilots and groundsmen from different units joined in this operation to help prevent unauthorized and unidentified aircraft from crossing the United States airspace illegally. Some after though the operation would grow to 150 guardsmen and control 6 F-16s. Around 1999 Operation Coronet Nighthawk was asked to leave Panama because of the Panama Canal Zone. The Panama Canal Zone was a treaty over the Panama river which included the US and Panama but fell off, and Panama decided to get the US base out of its countries. This kicked the US out of control of the canal, and they were asked to leave the airbase and to find a new site for this operation that had been there for almost 8‚Äì9 years. Finding a new site After the country of Panama kicked out the US had to find a new base of operation for Coronet Nighthawk. The operation was moved to Cura√ßao and Aruba near the Netherlands Antilles. Another choice was in Ecuador at the Manta Air Base. The base they moved to was also the international airport so most of the time they were sharing the space. During this time, they had completed 41 sorties, but two were scrubbed because of bad weather. They lived on the new based from January to February taking on these missions. On the return home to the states, some of the pilots were given an Air Force outstanding unit award. The award is only given to those who finish in the top ten percent of the Air Force in different performance ratings and some men of operation coronet Nighthawk was lucky enough to receive it. After the operation was disbanded the name was used in another operation using the new nighthawks planes being tested in Europe.

Published in 1979, it was designed by George Rohrbacher, a rancher in Washington state. The Farming Game painfully reflects the real-life difficulties of running a farm. Also, the names and places in the game are the names of families farming for generations in Yakima Valley and other parts of Central Washington. When Rohrbacher invented the game, it was a desperate time for his failing farm and small family, which is reflected in the difficulty of the game, and the multitude of points taken into consideration in farming that are often left up to chance. It is considered a board game which has educational value. The game sold more than 150,000 copies by 1985, and saved Rohrbacher's farm. By 1995, the estimate of copies sold was 350,000. Objective The game's objective is to raise money by harvesting crops and selling livestock, including hay, fruit, grain, and cattle. This is done by moving around the board using one die. Each trip around the board represents a year of farming, and players can increase their chances of earning more money by planting more crops or raising more livestock, which can be purchased by exercising the option given from an Option to Buy (O.T.B.) card a player has drawn during the course of the game. Elements of the game are intended to reflect aspects of real-life farming. For example, players sometimes encounter Farmer's Fate cards that are either good or bad, similar to the Chance cards found in Monopoly. One such card allows a player to collect $2,000 from every player who has no harvester, if you own one. Another card informs that due to the IRS garnishing your income, you may not collect on any of your harvests for the rest of the year. These cards are intended to reflect the element of chance or luck that is involved in farming, which is the aim of the game. Game play The board itself is divided into squares representing forty-nine of the fifty-two weeks in a year, with different sections grouped together under the usual harvest for that season. While there are multiple sections for harvesting hay (the first, second, third, and even fourth cutting), livestock are sold only once a year. Similar to real life, poor timing (or unlucky die rolls) can cause the player to miss, or skip over, a harvest. Players take turns rolling a die, traveling around the board, harvesting their crops when they can. Crops are purchased through O.T.B. (Option to Buy) cards usually referencing \\"Neighbor Sells Out: 10 Acres Grain\\", the crops are grouped into Hay, Grain (Wheat and Corn), Fruit (Apples and Cherries), and Livestock (Cattle). While hay is the cheapest to purchase and most often harvested, just as in real life, the chance for large profit is much smaller than with livestock or fruit. What balances this game, and provides the most difficulty for real life farmers, are operating expenses. In The Farming Game, whenever a player harvests a crop, he draws a card entitled Operating Expense, examples of which are \\"Pay $500 for Irrigation\\" or \\"Seed Bill Due: Pay $1,000\\". Also, certain spaces on the board instruct the player to draw a Farmer's Fate card. Farmer's Fate cards are usually unfortunate for the player, including references to the drought in the 1970s, Mt. St. Helens erupting, or chemical mishaps in which all the player's livestock are slaughtered. There are also expenses or bonuses incurred while traveling the board - some spaces instruct you to pay a fee for Winter-killed wheat or owning cattle, while another gives you a bonus of $1000 for a convenient \\"warm snap\\" early in the year. Strategy The Farming Game is a heavily chance dependent game, and thus the winner is usually determined by luck. However, a player can increase his or her chances of winning by knowing which crops are more likely to be profitable and use this information to make advantageous trades with other players. Based upon the probabilities of landing on each square and the average selling price of each commodity, Hay is slightly less profitable than Grain, while Cattle averages about 1.5 times as much profit as Grain. Fruit is even more lucrative, earning about 2.5 times as much profit as Grain. Thus, a player's first choice should always be to plant as much Fruit as possible. In fact, the advantage is so great that the winner will usually be the player lucky enough to draw the most O.T.B. Fruit cards. This can be risky, however, as fruit is the most expensive item to purchase; costs the most in terms of Operating Expenses, negative Farmer's Fate cards, and board square instructions; and it is one of the toughest harvest seasons to land on (Livestock is arguably as difficult if not more so to land on). A player's second choice should then be to raise Cattle, however, the game limits the number of Cattle one can raise on the farm to 20. In order to raise more, one must lease additional land, but in doing so you must pay a large fee. This fee is, in fact, higher than the total profit you are likely to earn on the Cattle by the end of the game! In other words, not only will you likely lose money on the investment, but you will also be losing the opportunity to invest your money in more profitable commodities. Thus, you should never lease additional land to raise Cattle. The only benefit to doing so is to avoid the dreaded Leaking Electrical Motor Farmer's Fate card, and since cows are relatively inexpensive, they can be easily replaced. A player's third choice should then be to choose to focus upon either Grain or Hay. If two players can agree to swap commodities so that one grows only Grain while the other grows only Hay, then they will both have a slight advantage over other players who grow both crops because they will pay less in harvesting fees. However, the Grain player will still have a slight advantage over the Hay player, which may make negotiating such a deal difficult. Another disadvantage to this strategy is that it decreases both players' chances of harvesting. If a player grows both, he removes much of the variability involved in his expected profit. Other mediums The Farming Game was adapted for Windows 3.1 in 1997 , when it won the 1997 Mahnke Multimedia Award given by the Association of Educators for Communication and Technology (AECT), an international organization. The Farming Game was also been adapted for Mac, PC, and Linux in November 2012 by Game Masterminds, a licensee of The Weekend Farmer Co.

It is sometimes referred to as Southeast Como, due to many of its streets ending in SE, and possibly to differentiate it from the Como neighborhood in neighboring Saint Paul. Its boundaries are East Hennepin Avenue to the north, 33rd Avenue Southeast (the eastern city limit) to the east, the Southeast Industrial Area to the south, and Interstate 35W to the west. Como features many amenities for its residents: Van Cleve Park Community Center, the Como Student Community Co- op, the University Childcare Center, Dar Al-Farooq mosque, SE Christian Church, and the Como Evangelical Free Church. The #3 busline is convenient to all who live in Como and provides easy transportation to Downtown Minneapolis, all of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campuses, and Downtown St. Paul. The high-traffic business roads, industry, abandoned industrial sites, and active railroads that surround Como contrast sharply with the residential character of the neighborhood. The housing stock consists of modest early 20th-century bungalows and Victorian and twenties-era homes mixed with a scattering of newer duplexes and single family homes. Some areas (e.g. along Como, 15th and Hennepin Avenues) have post-60's two-story walk-up apartment buildings. Commercial activity is focused on Como and East Hennepin Avenues. The neighborhood is served by two convenience grocery stores (including one with a laundromat and deli) and a number of small service businesses, including a hardware store, a barber, a dentist, two coffee houses, three bar/restaurants, a diner, a video rental shop, an electronics repair shop, a resale shop, three printers, a car parts store, several auto repair garages, and several gas stations. Governance The Southeast Como neighborhood is split between City of Minneapolis Wards 1 and 2, and is currently represented by Kevin Reich (Ward 1) and Cam Gordon (Ward 2). It also falls into the 2nd Police Precinct. Trivia *Como Avenue, which forms the spine of the residential neighborhood was originally a Territorial Road laid out in 1851, called the Willow River Road (Willow River is today's Hudson, WI). *Later, when St. Paul named Lake Como and it became a popular recreational spot, the section of the WillowRiver/Hudson Road that led to the lake from Minneapolis became known as the Como Road. *The first residential blocks were platted in 1882 by James Tallmadge Elwell. *Maria Sanford, the first female professor at the U of M, lived in the neighborhood and was active in the community church. *General Mills built their research laboratory here in 1930 and created Cheerioats, which is known as Cheerios today. In the early 1950s, GM's mechanical division invented the Ryan Flight Recorder, more famously known as the \\"black box\\".

The highway runs from west to east across the southern part of the state, just north of the Red River. The route begins at US-81 in Ryan and ends at US-70 in Kingston, a length of . SH-32 was first added to the state highway system at the end of 1934; none of the highway as created is part of the present-day SH-32 (having been encroached upon by US-70). SH-32 is also linked with SH-199‚Äîpart of SH-32 was spun off to create SH-199 in 1938. Route description SH-32 begins at US-81 in Ryan, where it follows the street grid, heading in a northeast direction. As the route leaves Ryan, it turns onto a due east course. It is until the next town, Grady. SH-32 turns to the southeast to serve this town. Six more miles (10 km) from Grady, SH-32 meets another highway for the first time, SH-89. At the junction, SH-32 turns south, overlapping SH-89 for six miles (10 km). While concurrent, the two highways pass through the unincorporated community of Petersburg, then turn to the west. The two routes divide at Courtney, where SH-89 heads south towards the Red River and Texas. SH-32 continues east from Courtney, crossing over Mud Creek, then passing through unincorporated Rubottom. East of Rubottom, the highway comes to the intersection with SH-76. The next unincorporated community SH-32 passes through is Turner. Eight miles (13 km) east of the SH-76 junction, at Dunbar, SH-32 serves as the northern terminus of SH-96, which serves Burneyville. Nine miles (14 km) east of Burneyville, SH-32 has an interchange with I-35 outside Marietta, the seat of Love County. Soon after passing I-35, SH-32 forms a brief concurrency with US-77, and passes through Marietta. East of town, the route comes to a junction with SH-77S (one of SH-77S's four termini). SH-32 continues east, following the curve of Lake Texoma's shoreline, passing through Lebanon. The highway then intersects with SH-99C. Five miles (8 km) east of SH-99C, SH-32 crosses US-377/SH-99. Two miles (3 km) further east, SH-32 acts as the southern endpoint of SH-70F. Two miles (3 km) after that, SH-32 ends at US-70 in Kingston. History State Highway 32 was commissioned on December 12, 1934. As originally created, the route ran from SH-14 (present-day US-183) in Davidson to Waurika, passing through the towns of Grandfield, Devol, and Randlett and the counties of Tillman, Cotton, and Jefferson. SH-32 was extended to cover approximately the west half of its present-day route on June 16, 1936; the route's new eastern terminus was US-77 in Marietta. On March 29, 1937, the highway was expanded even further east to end at US-70 in Madill. This extension was split off to form SH-199 on October 13, 1938. Meanwhile, changes were occurring in the eastern part of Jefferson County. The portion of highway from Ryan east to the Love County line was removed from the highway system on December 31, 1937. As a result, SH-32 was discontiguous; one section stretched from Davidson to Ryan, while another began at a spur ending at the Jefferson‚ÄìLove county line and continued east from there. The portion of SH-32 concurrent with US-81 between Waurika and Ryan, once necessary to connect to the now-decommissioned road, was removed on February 24, 1938. Both of these sections of road were reinstated as part of SH-32 on February 29, 1944. Changes in the routing of US-70 in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in the western part of SH-32 becoming concurrent with the U.S. highway through southwest Oklahoma during the late-1930s. US-70 as first designated in Oklahoma crossed into the state north of Burkburnett, Texas and intersected SH-32 in Randlett; continuing north of SH-32, the U.S. highway turned east, running through Walters. In Comanche, US-70 turned south along US-81 and followed it until reaching the present-day US-70 routing in Waurika. Between Randlett and Waurika, SH-32 provided a much more direct route. On May 6, 1936, US-70 was realigned to follow SH-32 between these two cities. On March 3, 1945, US-70 was realigned again. This brought the highway into Oklahoma much earlier, crossing the Red River much further west, in effect bypassing Wichita Falls, Texas. As a result of the realignment, US-70 intersected SH-32 at its western terminus in Davidson and followed it all the way to Waurika. The westernmost of SH-32 (as measured along the present-day US-70 alignment) were concurrent with US-70. SH-32 was resumed its expansion to the east on September 16, 1946. On that date, the highway's eastern terminus was set at its present location at US-70 in Kingston. Much of this extension reclaimed for SH-32 the stretch of road lost by the creation of SH-199. At this time, SH-32 was at its zenith; stretching from Davidson to Kingston, the route covered a total of along present-day roads. However, the westernmost of SH-32 still overlapped US-70. On September 6, 1966, after over twenty years of cosignage, SH-32 was truncated to its current western terminus in Ryan. Everything west of Waurika was now solely US-70. After the truncation of 1966, SH-32 had the same route that it does today.

On September 1, 1881 Mary Cummings married John Cummings, from a prominent Woburn family which owned so much land in the area it was called \\"Cummingsville\\". He himself owned a tannery and a farm which lay partly in Woburn and the larger part in neighboring Burlington. He had many ties to Boston including his job as president of the Shawmut Bank of Boston for nearly thirty years and as one of the founders of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and its treasurer from 1872 to 1889.The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans: Volume III John Cummings also served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Massachusetts Senate representing Woburn. Besides being credited with saving MIT with his personal funds, his philanthropy also included providing land for a fire station in Woburn and donating his natural history specimen collection to the Woburn Public Library. After John died in 1898, Mary remained in their mansion and maintained the farm while traveling abroad. Will of Mary Cummings Mary Cummings died on December 23, 1927 leaving her farm in trust nevertheless, to the City of Boston for use as a recreational park for the public, now known as Mary Cummings Park. Along with the land, she left a substantial maintenance and care trust fund to be supported by income from an office building next to Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston. She was inspired by the park and playground movements that swept the country during the late 19th and early 20th century. In fact, Mary made the Playground and Recreation Association of America (later renamed the National Recreation and Park Association) as the alternate trustee in case Boston decided not to accept the terms of her trust. Joseph Lee, a son of another Boston banker and a contemporary of her later years, was the President of the PRAA for many years and considered the \\"Father of the Playground Movement\\".‚Äùsee‚Äù external link Massachusetts Historical Society Finding aids \\"Joseph Lee (1862‚Äì1937) Biography; 'Founder of the Playground Movement'\\" see NRPA external link Mary also donated for a playground in Woburn, later renamed Gonsalves Park. Mary entrusted the park to the City of Boston, according to friends who were quoted in the newspaper after her death, because she believed that a Greater Boston would formally incorporate its suburbs just as New York City had incorporated the surrounding towns as boroughs and other American cities had followed a similar model. Boston had already incorporated several formerly adjacent towns such as Roxbury, Dorchester, Brighton and Hyde Park. Although she specified the City of Boston as the trustee, the \\"public\\" are the beneficiaries. She had a vision for her park that it was to be enjoyed by all.

In it, he attempts to explain the origins of Christianity, and claims that it can best be explained by historical materialism rather than divinity. Publishing history The first edition in English, published in 1925 by George Allen and Unwin, followed the eleventh German version. The German text was re-translated into English by Henry F. Mins, and published by Russell and Russell in 1953. In 1972, a translation by Jacob W. Hartmann was published by Monthly Review Press. The edition current in print was published by Resistance in 2007 and contains a preface by Michael Lowy. Summary In his foreword, Kautsky expressed his hope that the book would be 'a powerful weapon in the struggles of the present, in order to hasten the attainment of a better future'. He began his analysis by looking for evidence that 'the person of Jesus' existed at all, using pagan and Christian sources. The next dozen chapters are then taken up with a materialist description of the ancient Roman society from which early Christianity sprang. Kautsky then went on to describe the history of the Jewish people, up to the point where Christianity began. Having set the scene, Kautsky described the beginnings of Christianity. The next five sections are called 'The Primitive Christian Community', 'The Christian Idea of the Messiah', 'Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians', 'The History of Christ's Passion' and 'The Development of the Christian Community'. Kautsky contended that Christianity was born out of a group of Jewish proletarians in a decaying Roman empire, who sought to defeat the Romans through a violent insurrection.

Before his tenure as Commissioner, he was a member of the New York State Assembly and represented District 65 as a member of the Democratic Party for the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side of Manhattan and Roosevelt Island. His firing by Governor David Paterson in October 2010 was controversial to many especially environmentalists. Education and early career Grannis is a graduate of Rutgers University and the University of Virginia School of Law. His first job with New York state's government was as compliance counsel to the Department of Environmental Conservation. New York State Assembly He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 2007, sitting in the 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 193rd, 194th, 195th, 196th and 197th New York State Legislatures. Grannis served as Chair of the Insurance Committee in the Assembly and was a member of several other standing committees. In his capacity as Chairman he authoring New York State's Community Rating/Open Enrollment Law, as well as the 1996 Managed Care Consumer Protection Act. As Insurance committee chairman, he co-sponsored New York's Stem Cell Research Bill. He promoted the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) in 1978. \\"Grannis work[ed] for passage of the 'Bottle Bill' and 'brownfields' clean-up legislation [in] 1982.\\" Other notable pieces of legislation Grannis wrote are New York State's Clean Indoor Air Act (1989), which severely restricted cigarette smoking within public buildings, and the Adolescent Tobacco Use Prevention Act. He served for a decade as Chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee. He previously served as chairman of an Assembly Subcommittee on toxic waste issues. He served on the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee his entire time in office. Elections Generally, Grannis was re-elected overwhelmingly in his progressive East Side district. In 1998, Grannis received 23,815 votes to Liberal-Republican Mark H. Snyder's 7,841 votes. He was re-elected in 2000 with 34,230 votes, to Peter McCoy (Republican) with 11,357, and Edward V. Price (Independent), with 580. Grannis had another three-way race in 2002, when he received 18,600 votes on the Democratic and Working Families Party lines, to 9,021 for David A. Friedman (on the Republican, Independence, and Liberal Party lines), and 377 for Ivana M. Edwards of the Green Party. In 2004, Grannis was re-elected by a vote of 37,917 to 11,710 for Patricia Leslie. He was last re-elected in 2006 with a vote of 25,334 to 5,499 over Republican Michael Fandal. New York State Comptroller bid In January 2007 he filed an application for consideration by the State Legislature for appointment as New York State Comptroller, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of Alan Hevesi. He was one of 19 candidates for Comptroller. Alan Chartock called him \\"One of the most qualified of the legislators\\" to be Comptroller, but due to \\"the matter of political balance [it] is tough to imagine either Spitzer or Silver giving the job to another Manhattan politician.\\" He interviewed with the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the search committee. He withdrew his application for Comptroller after being nominated as Environmental Conservation Commissioner. Department of Environmental Conservation Albany Grannis was nominated by Governor Eliot Spitzer as DEC Commissioner on January 25, 2007. He was confirmed on April 1, 2007 by the New York State Senate. As Commissioner, Grannis managed hundreds of employees and represented the state government's ecological efforts. He appointed Peter M. Iwanowicz, as director of a new Climate Change Office, on May 10, 2007. He replaced some of the regional directors for DEC. As part of his duties, he inspected polluted sites, such as Scajaquada Creek in western New York. He had some administrative law duties, which included fining polluters; in July 2007, he assessed \\"Walter French $48,800 for [a] floating camp at Cranberry L[ake]\\" Grannis was also Chairman and ex officio member of the board of the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation (EFC), a public benefit corporation which funds \\"programs that help New York State municipalities, agencies and businesses undertake projects ... to be environmentally responsible.\\" Firing On October 21, 2010, he was fired from that position by Spitzer's successor, Governor David Paterson. The firing came after a memo prepared by Grannis, detailing how the governor's proposed budget cuts would impair environmental protection in New York, was leaked to the press. Reaction Environmental activists unanimously reacted negatively to Grannis' firing. A Sierra Club spokesman called his sacking \\"appalling\\". Rob Moore, director of Environmental Advocates, said \\"I think Gov.

The original text was written in longhand in Polish. The encyclical was promulgated on 30 November 1980. Background John Paul II had a strong love for the Divine Mercy, a devotion revealed by his fellow Pole, Sister Faustina Kowalska (b. 1905 - d.1938), a devotion that he later instituted for the entire Catholic Church in 2000 as Divine Mercy Sunday and during which vigil, in 2005, he died. He told his biographer George Weigel that he felt spiritually \\"very near\\" to Sister Faustina when he began the encyclical. Pope John Paul II's second encyclical continues to examine the world problems brought up in his first encyclical, Redemptor hominis, including rising militarization, tyranny, starvation, and daily problems of personal life. He teaches that the only authentic Christian response to these rising problems is through love informed by God's mercy, especially as revealed in the love of the Father in the Trinity. Introduction of the Encyclical Just as in his previous encyclical, John Paul motivates his discussion by examining many problems in the world. He posits that many in today's world are made uneasy by the idea of mercy. In opposition to an impersonal, technology-driven dominion over the world that \\"seems to have no room for mercy,\\" John Paul appeals to the world to turn to the mercy of God: \\"I wish them to be a heartfelt appeal by the Church to mercy, which humanity and the modern world need so much. And they need mercy even though they often do not realize it.\\" Revelation as ongoing The title is taken from St. Paul, who writes in Ephesians 2:4 that God is ‚Äúrich in mercy‚Äù.De Souza, Raymond J., \\"Two Centuries of Mercy\\", National Catholic Register, December 9, 2015 The theme is \\"the revelation of the mystery of the Father and his love\\".O'Collins, Gerald. \\"John Paul II and the Development of Doctrine\\", The Legacy of John Paul II, Bloomsbury Publishing, Oct 30, 2008 \\"It is, from beginning to end, a reminder to the Church of who the Father is, - who he reveals himself to be.\\"Bulzacchelli, Richard H., \\"Dives in Misericoria\\", Karol Wojtyla's Philosophical Legacy, (Nancy Mardas, Agnes B. Curry, George F. McLean, eds.), CRVP, 2008 This reiterates a concept discussed in the 1979 apostolic exhortation Catechesi tradendae, which speaks of revelation as both a past and present reality. Jesus' message of mercy The pope places a special emphasis on Jesus' teaching mission to the poor, the sick, the sinners and the outcast: \\"Especially through His lifestyle and through His actions, Jesus revealed that love is present in the world in which we live.... This love makes itself particularly noticed in contact with suffering.\\" Tying this with Jesus' claim that \\"He who has seen me has seen the Father,\\" John Paul points out that this reveals a similar merciful love for all in the world, especially those who suffer. Background in the Old Testament The pope traces the message of divine mercy back to earlier books in the Bible. He discusses the repeated instances of God returning to his people after their abandoning him. John Paul also takes of the issue of contrasting mercy with justice: \\"in many cases [mercy] is shown to be not only more powerful than that justice but also more profound.\\" He writes that Scripture shows that \\"Mercy differs from justice, but is not in opposition to it, if we admit in the history of man ... the presence of God, who already as Creator has linked Himself to His creature with a particular love.\\" The prodigal The Return of the Prodigal Son (Le retour de l'enfant prodigue), by James Tissot, Brooklyn Museum John Paul puts forth the Parable of the Prodigal Son as an especially vivid analogy of God's mercy for man. > When the son decides to return to his father's house, to ask his father to > be received-no longer by virtue of his right as a son, but as an employee > -at first sight he seems to be acting by reason of the hunger and poverty > that he had fallen into; this motive, however, is permeated by an awareness > of a deeper loss: to be a hired servant in his own father's house is > certainly a great humiliation and source of shame. Nevertheless, the > prodigal son is ready to undergo that humiliation and shame. He realizes > that he no longer has any right except to be an employee in his father's > house. His decision is taken in full consciousness of what he has deserved > and of what he can still have a right to in accordance with the norms of > justice. John Paul enlarges on the reaction of the son's father, who welcomes him with unbounded merciful love, rather than a mere insistence on justice. \\"It becomes more evident that love is transformed into mercy when it is necessary to go beyond the precise norm of justice-precise and often too narrow.\\" John Paul points out that the father's reaction is based on more than mere sentiment, but on a deeper understanding of what his son really needs: \\"Notice, the father is aware that a fundamental good has been saved: the good of his son's humanity. Although the son has squandered the inheritance, nevertheless his humanity is saved.\\" The pope makes the point that this parable illustrates that mercy is best judged not from the mere externals, but from a deeper examination of what it does to the interior of man. Mercy as revealed in the Crucifixion and Resurrection John Paul then turns to the central message of Christianity: Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, and examines them for their implications on God's mercy. In his Passion, Christ appeals for mercy, but he himself is not spared. Pope John Paul calls this a \\"superabundance\\" of God's justice as reparation for the sins of man, yet springing from the supreme love of the Father for man. Thus, he writes, in Jesus' crucifixion, justice is simultaneously fulfilled and revealed by a deeper love: \\"The divine dimension of redemption is put into effect not only by bringing justice to bear upon sin, but also by restoring to love that creative power in man thanks also which he once more has access to the fullness of life and holiness that come from God. In this way, redemption involves the revelation of mercy in its fullness.\\"  References  External links *Divine Mercy Shrine in Plock *Complete text of the encyclical from the Vatican website *Catechism of the Catholic Church from the official website of the Vatican Category:Papal encyclicals Category:Documents of the Catholic Social Teaching tradition Category:Documents of Pope John Paul II Category:1980 in Christianity Category:1980 documents Category:Divine Mercy Category:November 1980 events ","title":"Dives in misericordia"},{"id":"7056912","text":"Offerings at the clootie well near Munlochy, on the Black Isle, Easter Ross Clootie tree next to St Brigid's Well, Kildare, Ireland. Clootie wells (also Cloutie or Cloughtie wells) are places of pilgrimage in Celtic areas. They are wells or springs, almost always with a tree growing beside them, where strips of cloth or rags have been left, usually tied to the branches of the tree as part of a healing ritual. In Scots nomenclature, a \\"clootie\\" or \\"cloot\\" is a strip of cloth or rag. Practices Clootie tree at Sancreed Well, Cornwall When used at the clootie wells in Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man, the pieces of cloth are generally dipped in the water of the holy well and then tied to a branch while a prayer of supplication is said to the spirit of the well ‚Äì in modern times usually a saint, but in pre-Christian times a goddess or local nature spirit. This is most often done by those seeking healing, though some may do it simply to honour the spirit of the well. In either case, many see this as a probable continuation of the ancient Celtic practice of leaving votive offerings in wells or pits.Healy, Elizabeth (2002) In Search of Ireland's Holy Wells. Dublin, Wolfhound Press pp. 12‚Äì19, 27, 56‚Äì7, 66, 69, 81.Logan, Patrick (1980) The Holy Wells of Ireland. Buckinghamshire, Colin Smythe Limited. . pp. 22‚Äì3, 95. There are local variations to the practice. At some wells the tradition is to wash the affected part of the body with the wet rag and then tie the washing-rag on the branch; as the rag disintegrates over time, the ailment is supposed to fade away as well. At some wells the clooties are definitely \\"rags\\" and discards, at others, brightly coloured strips of fine cloth. In some locations the ceremony may also include circumambulation (or circling) of the well a set number of times and making an offering of a coin, pin or stone. Additional votive offerings hung on the branches or deposited in the wells may include rosaries, religious medals, crosses, religious icons and other symbols of faith. At clootie wells where the operative principle is to shed the ailment, and the clootie is thought to represent the ailment, the \\"offerings\\" may be grotesque castoffs. Those that instead view the clootie as an offering to the spirit, saint or deity are more likely to tie an attractive, clean piece of cloth or ribbon. The sacred trees at clootie wells are usually hawthorn trees, though ash trees are also common. The most popular times for pilgrimages to clootie wells, like other holy wells, are on the feast days of Saints, the Pattern or Patron day, or on the old Gaelic festival days of Imbolc (1 February), Beltane (1 May), Lughnasadh (1 August), or Samhain (1 November).Healy (2002) p. 19.

Here the well was once thought to have had the power to cure sick children who were left there overnight. In the heart of Culloden woods near the battlefield is a walled clootie well also known as St Mary's well. This well was traditionally visited on the first Sunday in May. Until recently, it was a popular holiday, with an ice-cream van situated in the car park. However, this tradition is now in decline although still marked. Craigie Well at Avoch on the Black Isle has both offerings of coins and clooties. Rags, wool and human hair were also used as charms against sorcery, and as tokens of penance or fulfilment of a vow.Sharp, Mick (1997) Holy Places of Celtic Britain. London, Blandford. . p. 172. A clootie well once existed at Kilallan near Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire. This holy well was dedicated to St Fillan and cloth was tied to overhanging shrub branches. St Fillan's Clootie Well, Kilallan.

In Ireland at Loughcrew, Oldcastle, County Meath () there is a wishing tree, where visitors to the passage tombs tie ribbons to the branch of a hawthorn tree. Loughcrew is a site of considerable historical importance in Ireland. It is the site of megalithic burial grounds dating back to approximately 3500 and 3300 BC, situated near the summit of Sliabh na Caill√≠ and on surrounding hills and valleys. Popular culture In 2002, the folklorist Marion Bowman observed that the number of clootie wells had \\"increased markedly\\" both at existing and new locations in recent years. She added that those engaged in the practice often conceived of it as an ancient \\"Celtic\\" activity which they were perpetuating. A fictional clootie well at Auchterarder features in the 2006 novel The Naming of the Dead by Ian Rankin, who visited the clootie well at Munlochy on Black Isle before writing the book. The 2018 film The Party's Just Beginning, written and directed by Inverness-born filmmaker Karen Gillan, features the Munlochy clootie well.

After escaping an unwelcome marriage on Crete, she was rescued by a fisherman from Aegina. In payment for this he also proposed an unwelcome marriage. So Afea headed out of Aghia Marina towards the mountain top where she vanished at the current site of the temple, where it is said that the fisherman established a shrine believing Afea to have been taken by the gods. is located within a sanctuary complex dedicated to the goddess Aphaia on the Greek island of Aigina, which lies in the Saronic Gulf. Formerly known as the Temple of Jupiter Panhellenius, the great Doric temple is now recognized as dedicated to the mother-goddess Aphaia. It was a favorite of the neoclassical and romantic artists such as J. M. W. Turner. It stands on a c. 160 m peak on the eastern side of the island approximately 13 km east by road from the main port.The main port and the main city are named Aigina, after the island. The Temple of Aphaia is 9.6 km east of this city. The sanctuary is also 29.5 km southwest of the Acropolis of Athens, which is visible across the gulf on a clear day. Aphaia (Greek ) was a Greek goddess who was worshipped exclusively at this sanctuary. The extant temple of c. 500 BC was built over the remains of an earlier temple of c. 570 BC, which was destroyed by fire c. 510 BC. Elements of this older destroyed temple were buried in the infill for the larger, flat terrace of the later temple, and are thus well preserved. Abundant traces of paint remain on many of these buried fragments. There may have been another temple in the 7th century BC, also located on the same site, but it is thought to have been much smaller and simpler in terms of both plan and execution. Significant quantities of Late Bronze Age figurines have been discovered at the site, including proportionally large numbers of female figurines (kourotrophoi), indicating ‚Äì perhaps ‚Äì that cult activity at the site was continuous from the 14th century BC, suggesting a Minoan connection for the cult.Pilafidis-Williams argues that the character and relative proportions of the finds leads to the conclusion that the deity worshiped was a female fertility/agricultural goddess. The last temple is of an unusual plan and is also significant for its pedimental sculptures, which are thought to illustrate the change from Archaic to Early Classical technique. These sculptures are on display in the Glyptothek of Munich, with a number of fragments located in the museums at Aigina and on the site itself.The important Bronze Age archaeological site of Kolona is northwest of Aigina (the main city) along the coast, and a museum is located at this site. The museum at Aigina was the first institution of its kind in Greece, but most of the collection (other than a collection of bas relief panels from Delos) was transferred to Athens in 1834 (EB), where it can be seen in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. The museum on the site contains a restoration of the Early Archaic temple entablature and pediment, as well as copies of elements of the pedimental sculpture of the Late Archaic temple set into restored sections of the pediment.  Exploration and archaeology  Plan of the sanctuary The periegetic writer Pausanias briefly mentions the site in his writings of the 2nd century AD, but does not describe the sanctuary in detail as he does for many others.Description of Greece 2.30.3 > On Aigina as one goes toward the mountain of Pan-Greek Zeus, the sanctuary > of Aphaia comes up, for whom Pindar composed an ode at the behest of the > Aeginetans. The Cretans say (the myths about her are native to Crete) that > Euboulos was the son of Karmanor, who purified Apollo of the killing of the > Python, and they say that Britomaris was the daughter of Zeus and Karme (the > daughter of this Euboulos). She enjoyed races and hunts and was particularly > dear to Artemis. While fleeing from Minos, who lusted after her, she cast > herself into nets cast for a catch of fish. Artemis made her a goddess, and > not only the Cretans but also the Aeginetans reverence her. The Aeginetans > say that Britomaris showed herself to them on their island. Her epithet > among the Aeginetans is Aphaia, and it is Diktynna on Crete. The temple was made known in Western Europe by the publication of the Antiquities of Ionia (London, 1797). In 1811, the young English architect Charles Robert Cockerell, finishing his education on his academic Grand Tour, and Baron Otto Magnus von Stackelberg removed the fallen fragmentary pediment sculptures. On the recommendation of Baron Carl Haller von Hallerstein, who was also an architect and, moreover, a prot√©g√© of the art patron Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, the marbles were shipped abroad and sold the following year to the Crown Prince, soon to be King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Minor excavations of the east peribolos wall were carried out in 1894 during reconstruction of the last temple. Systematic excavations at the site were carried out in the 20th century by the German School in Athens, at first under the direction of Adolf Furtw√§ngler. The area of the sanctuary was defined and studied during these excavations. The area under the last temple could not be excavated, however, because that would have harmed the temple. In addition, significant remains from the Bronze Age were detected in pockets in the rocky surface of the hill. From 1966 to 1979, an extensive second German excavation under Dieter Ohly was performed, leading to the discovery in 1969 of substantial remains of the older Archaic temple in the fill of the later terrace walls. Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner and Martha Ohly were also associated with this dig, which continued after the death of Dieter Ohly until 1988. Sufficient remains were recovered to allow a complete architectural reconstruction of the structure to be extrapolated; the remains of the entablature and pediment of one end of the older temple have been reconstructed in the on-site museum.  Phases of the sanctuary  The sanctuary of Aphaia was located on the top of a hill c. 160 m in elevation at the northeast point of the island. The last form of the sanctuary covered an area of c. 80 by 80 m; earlier phases were less extensive and less well defined.  Bronze Age phase  In its earliest phase of use during the Bronze Age, the eastern area of the hilltop was an unwalled, open- air sanctuary to a female fertility and agricultural deity. Bronze Age figurines outnumber remains of pottery. Open vessel forms are also at an unusually high proportion versus closed vessels. There are no known settlements or burials in the vicinity, arguing against the remains being due to either usage. Large numbers of small pottery chariots and thrones and miniature vessels have been found. Although there are scattered remains dating to the Early Bronze Age such as two seal stones, remains in significant quantities begin to be deposited in the Middle Bronze Age, and the sanctuary has its peak use in the LHIIIa2 through LHIIIb periods. It is less easy to trace the cult through the Sub-Mycenean period and into the Geometric where cult activity is once more reasonably certain.  Late Geometric phase  Furtw√§ngler proposes three phases of building at the sanctuary, with the earliest of these demonstrated by an altar at the eastern end dating to c. 700 BC. Also securely known are a cistern at the northeast extremity and a structure identified as a treasury east of the propylon (entrance) of the sanctuary. The temple corresponding to these structures is proposed to be under the later temples and thus not able to be excavated. Furtw√§ngler suggests that this temple is the oikos (house) referenced in a mid-7th-century BC inscription from the site as having been built by a priest for Aphaia; he hypothesizes that this house of the goddess (temple) was built of stone socles topped with mud brick upper walls and wooden entablature.Ohly disputes that there is sufficient evidence for this oikos structure. The top of the hill was slightly modified to make it more level by wedging stones into the crevices of the rock.  Archaic phase (Aphaia Temple I)  Reconstructed entablature and pediment of the Temple of Aphaia I in the on-site museum. Ohly detected a (stone socle and mudbrick upper level) peribolos wall enclosing an area of c. 40 by 45 m dating to this phase. This peribolos was not aligned to the axis of the temple. A raised and paved platform was built to connect the temple to the altar. There was a propylon (formal entrance gate) with a wooden superstructure in the southeast side of the peribolos. A 14 m tall column topped by a sphinx was at the northeast side of the sanctuary. The full study and reconstruction of the temple was done by Schwandner, who dates it to before 570 BC. In his reconstruction, the temple is prostyle-tetrastyle in plan, and has a pronaos and ‚Äì significantly ‚Äì an adyton at the back of the cella. As is the case at the temples of Artemis at Brauron and Aulis (among others), many temples of Artemis have such back rooms, which may indicate a similarity of cult practice.Hollinshead disputes that there is sufficient evidence for the presence of an adyton in this temple, and she questions whether similarity of form among temples of Artemis must indicate similarity of cult practice. This feature was not retained in the late Archaic temple, so its centrality to the cult practice is open to question. The cella of the temple of Aphaia had the unusual feature of having two rows of two columns supporting another level of columns that reached the roof. The architrave of this temple was constructed in two courses, giving it a height of 1.19 m versus the frieze height of 0.815 m; this proportion is unusual among temples of the region, but is known from temples in Sicily. A triglyph and metope frieze is also placed along the inside of the pronaos.Schwandner wants this placement to refute the idea that triglyphs are meant to represent the ends of wooden beams. These metopes were apparently undecorated with sculpture, and there is no evidence of pedimental sculptural groups. This temple and much of the sanctuary was destroyed by fire around 510 BC.  Late Archaic Phase (Aphaia Temple II)  View east from the opisthodomos of the Temple of Aphaia II showing the colonnades of the cella. Construction of a new temple commenced soon after the destruction of the older temple. The remains of the destroyed temple were removed from the site of the new temple and used to fill a c. 40 by 80 m terrace within the overall sanctuary of c. 80 by 80 m. This new temple terrace was aligned on north, west, and south with the plan of the new temple. The temple was a hexastyle peripteral Doric order structure on a 6 by 12 column plan resting on a 15.5 by 30.5 m platform; it had a distyle in antis cella with an opisthodomos and a pronaos.The use of the 6 by 12 plan of the Late Archaic period soon gave way to the Classical period preference for the proportions of the 6 by 13 plan and similar. All but three of the outer columns were monolithic. There was a small, off-axis doorway between the cella and the opisthodomos. In similar design but more monumental execution than the earlier temple, the cella of the new temple had two rows of five columns, supporting another level of columns that reached to roof. The corners of the roof were decorated with sphinx acroteria, and the central, vegetal acroterion of each side had a pair of kore statues standing one on either side, an unusual feature. The antefixes were of marble, as were the roof tiles. geisa of the Temple of Aphaia II showing slotted triglyphs. Dates ranging from 510 to 470 BC have been proposed for this temple. Bankel, who published the complete study of the remains, compares the design features of the structure with three structures that were near contemporaries: *The Athenian Treasury at Delphi *The Doric Temple in the Marmaria area of Delphi *The temple of Artemis at Delion on Paros Bankel says the temple of Aphaia is more developed than the earlier phase of this structure, giving it a date of around 500 BC. The metopes of this temple, which were not found, were slotted into the triglyph blocks and attached to backer blocks with swallowtail clamps. If they were wooden, their lack of preservation is to be expected. If they were stone, then they may have been removed for the ancient antiquities market while the structure was still standing.Bankel notes that c. 80% of the triglyph blocks were damaged in a manner consistent with intentional breakage to remove the metopes. The altar was redone for this phase as well. If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.  Pedimental sculptures  Sculpture of a warrior from the east pediment of the Temple of Aphaia II. The marbles from the Late Archaic temple of Aphaia, comprising the sculptural groups of the east and west pediments of the temple, are on display in the Glyptothek of Munich, where they were restored by the Danish neoclassic sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. These works exerted a formative influence on the local character of Neoclassicism in Munich, as exhibited in the architecture of Leo von Klenze. Each pediment centered on the figure of Athena, with groups of combatants, fallen warriors, and arms filling the decreasing angles of the pediments. The theme shared by the pediments was the greatness of Aigina as shown by the exploits of its local heroes in the two Trojan wars, one led by Heracles against Laomedon and a second led by Agamemnon against Priam. According to the standard myths, Zeus raped the nymph Aigina, who bore the first king of the island, Aiakos. This king had the sons Telamon (father of the Homeric hero Ajax) and Peleus (father of the Homeric hero Achilles). The Greek idolize heroes who fallen at war, to die on the battleground was a great honor it depicted courage and strength. When a hero died it was thought that they become immortal because they prove themselves to the Gods. The sculptures preserve extensive traces of a complex paint scheme, and are crucial for the study of painting on ancient sculpture. The marbles are finished even on the back surfaces of the figures, despite the fact that these faced the pediment and were thus not visible. Sculpture of a warrior from the west pediment of the Temple of Aphaia II. Ohly had contended that there were four total pedimental groups (two complete sets of pediments for the east and west sides of the temple); Bankel uses the architectural remains of the temple to argue that there were only three pedimental groups; later in his life, Ohly came to believe that there were only two, which was shown persuasively by Eschbach.N. Eschbach, Die archaische Form in nacharchaischer Zeit: Untersuchungen zu Ph√§nomenen der archaistischen Plastik des 5. und 4. Jhs. v. Chr.‚Äù Unpublished Habilitationschrift, University of Giessen. There were shallow cuttings and many dowels used to secure the plinths of the sculptures of the west pediment (the back of the temple). The east pediment used deep cuttings and fewer dowels to secure the plinths of the statues. There were also a number of geison blocks that had shallow cuttings and many dowels like the west pediment, but that did not fit there. Bankel argues that sculptures were set on both the east and the west pediments with these shallow cuttings, but that the sculptures of the east pediment were removed (along with the geison blocks cut to receive them) and replaced with a different sculptural group. This replacement appears to have been carried out before the raking geisa were installed on the east pediment, since the corner geisa were not cut down to join to the raking geisa: i.e. the 1st phase of the east pediment was replaced with the 2nd phase before that end of the temple was completed. As the eastern facade of the temple (the front) was the most important visually, it is not surprising that the builders would choose to focus additional efforts on it.  Eastern pediment  Colourful Reconstruction of the Eastern pediment The first Trojan war, not the one described by Homer but the war of Heracles against the king of Troy Laomedon is the theme, with Telamon figuring prominently as he fights alongside Heracles against king Laomedon. This pediment is thought to be later than the west pediment and to show a number of features appropriate to the Classical period: the statues show a dynamic posture especially in the case of Athena, chiastic composition, and intricate filling of the space using the legs of fallen combatants to fill the difficult decreasing angles of the pediment. Part of the eastern pediment was destroyed during the Persian Wars, possibly by a thunderbolt. The statues that survived were set up in the sanctuary enclosure, and those that were destroyed, were buried according to the ancient custom. The old composition was replaced by a new one with a scene of a battle, again with Athena at the center.Leaflet \\"The Sanctuary of Aphaia on Aegina\\", Greek Ministry of Culture, Archaeological Receipts Fund, Athens 1998.  Western pediment  Colourful Reconstruction of the Western pediment The second Trojan war ‚Äì the one described by Homer ‚Äì is the theme, with Ajax (son of Telamon) figuring prominently. The style of these sculptures is that of the Archaic period. The composition deals with the decreasing angles of the pediment by filling the space using a shield and a helmet.

In 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars, he commanded the Spanish Army in a mostly unsuccessful effort to hold back the army of the First French Republic. He died in battle fighting the French. Early career and 1793 Luis Ferm√≠n De Carvajal was born in 1752 in Lima. King Charles III of Spain conferred upon him the title Conde de la Uni√≥n on 2 August 1778. At the outbreak of the War of the Pyrenees in 1793, he commanded the fortress of San Fernando at Figueres. Under the command of Antonio Ricardos the Spanish army was generally successful in 1793, capturing and holding part of French Rousillon. As a Lieutenant General, De la Uni√≥n led a division under Ricardos in a victory at the Battle of Truillas on 22 September 1793.Smith, p 57 When Ricardos died in Madrid in early 1794, and his successor Alejandro O'Reilly expired soon after, King Charles IV of Spain appointed de la Uni√≥n to command the army. In command In April 1794, the newly organized and reinforced French Army of the eastern Pyrenees under Jacques Fran√ßois Dugommier launched a powerful offensive against the Spanish foothold in France. On 30 April and 1 May, the French defeated de la Uni√≥n at the Battle of Boulou, forcing the Spanish army south of the Pyrenees.Smith, p 77 The French recaptured the port of Collioure at the end of May,Smith, p 81 and blockaded the Spanish garrison of the Fort de Bellegarde at the Pass of Le Perthus. De la Uni√≥n made two attempts to break through the blockade. The first try was repulsed at La Junquera on 7 June.Ostermann-Chandler, p 407 The second attempt ended in failure at the Battle of San Lorenzo de la Muga on 13 AugustSmith, p 88 and Bellegarde fell on 17 September.Smith, p 91 View south from the Fort de Bellegarde past the Panissars blockhouse. La Junquera is at the left center and Black Mountain (Mont Roig) is on the center horizon. De la Uni√≥n built a chain of 90 redoubts running from Sant Lloren√ß de la Muga to the coast. The lines were designed to protect the Alt Emporda from French invasion, but were manned by troops of uneven quality. The best units were the Spanish Guard and Walloon Guard, with three battalions each. Regular line infantry and provincial militia also manned the defenses. The French blow fell in the early hours of 17 November and the Battle of the Black Mountain ensued. On the first day, the French gained ground on the western flank, but were repulsed in the center and on the eastern flank. A Spanish artillery shell killed Dugommier on the 18th and his successor Dominique Catherine de P√©rignon ordered a temporary halt in the fighting. On 20 November, P√©rignon resumed the attack and the French rapidly broke through the first and second Spanish lines. The French assaulted the 25-gun Notre-Dame-del-Roure redoubt for three hours, finally seizing the key position at 3:00 PM.Ostermann-Chandler, p 408 Arriving at Pont de Molins, de la Uni√≥n led a counterattack by 1,300 cavalry against two brigades of French infantry. During the subsequent struggle, he fell, fatally hit by two bullets.Prats, Del Roure The battle ended in a rout of the Spanish army.

(1997) \\"Science Studies: an advanced introduction\\" New York University Press, The term itself was coined in 1973 by Drew University anthropologist Roger W. Wescott, who defined it as being the \\"serious and systematic study of all phenomena that fail to fit the picture of reality provided for us by common sense or by the established sciences.\\" Wescott credited journalist and researcher Charles Fort as being the creator of anomalistics as a field of research, and he named biologist Ivan T. Sanderson and Sourcebook Project compiler William R. Corliss as being instrumental in expanding anomalistics to introduce a more conventional perspective into the field.Clark, Jerome (1993) \\"Encyclopedia of Strange and Unexplained Physical Phenomena\\", Thomson Gale, Henry Bauer, emeritus professor of science studies at Virginia Tech, writes that anomalistics is \\"a politically correct term for the study of bizarre claims\\",Bauer, Henry (2000) Science Or Pseudoscience: Magnetic Healing, Psychic Phenomena and Other Heterodoxies, University of Illinois Press, while David J. Hess of the Department of Science and Technology Studies at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute describes it as being \\"the scientific study of anomalies defined as claims of phenomena not generally accepted by the bulk of the scientific community.\\" Anomalistics covers several sub-disciplines, including ufology, cryptozoology, and parapsychology. Researchers involved in the field have included ufologist J. Allen Hynek and cryptozoologist Bernard Heuvelmans, and parapsychologist John Hayes.Science, 5 November 1999: Vol. 286. no. 5442, p. 1079.Science, 14 May 2010, Vol. 328. no. 5980, p.854. Field According to Marcello Truzzi, Professor of Sociology at Eastern Michigan University, anomalistics works on the principles that \\"unexplained phenomena exist\\", but that most can be explained through the application of scientific scrutiny. Further, that something remains plausible until it has been conclusively proven not only implausible but actually impossible, something that science does not do. In 2000, he wrote that anomalistics has four basic functions: # to aid in the evaluation of a wide variety of anomaly claims proposed by protoscientists; # to understand better the process of scientific adjudication and to make that process both more just and rational; # to build a rational conceptual framework for both categorizing and accessing anomaly claims; and # to act in the role of amicus curiae (\\"friend of the court\\") to the scientific community in its process of adjudication.Truzzi, Marcello (2002) \\"The Perspective of Anomalistics\\" (section only) - \\"Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience\\", Fitzroy Dearborn, Scope In the view of Truzzi, anomalistics has two core tenets governing its scope: # Research must remain within the conventional boundaries; and # Research must deal exclusively with \\"empirical claims of the extraordinary\\", rather than claims of a \\"metaphysical, theological or supernatural\\" nature. According to Wescott, anomalistics is also concerned with ostensibly paranormal phenomena, such as apparitions and poltergeists, or \\"psi\\" (parapsychology, e.g., ESP, psychokinesis and telepathy). Validation According to Truzzi, before an explanation can be considered valid within anomalistics, it must fulfill four criteria. It must be based on conventional knowledge and reasoning; it must be kept simple and be unburdened by speculation or overcomplexity; the burden of proof must be placed on the claimant and not the researcher; and the more extraordinary the claim, the higher the level of proof required.

He spent most of his creative career at the Soyuzmultfilm Studio, in Moscow, where he served as art director on Cheburashka, 38 Parrots, The Golden Antelope, The Scarlet Flower, The Snow Queen and many other cartoons. Early life Shvartsman grew up in a Yiddish- speaking religious family in the city of Old Minsk. His father had a job as an accountant at an brick factory but he died prematurely when Shvartsman was just 13 years of age. His maternal grandparents immigrated to the US in 1924, which left the family in debt and he had to take care of his siblings. After his elementary education ended due his interest in communist youth movements, he attended a gymnasium which today has been converted into a public school. In 1935, he attended a then new art school with his friend and future colleague Lev Milchin. After graduating, they both moved to Leningrad in hopes to pursue artistic careers, but the Academy of Fine Arts never acknowledged their applications and they were forced to go to a preparatory program in Leningrad Art School. Shvartsman's mother and nephew starved to death in the Siege of Leningrad, and, in the words of him, \\"not a single on of my peers ever returned to the battlefield\\". He legally changed his name to Izrail after the country Israel won the Six-Day war.Drawing on their Jewish heritage Career Homeless, without parents or siblings, and being denied an art career, he sought out more marginal corners in the creative world. In 1945, he applied to the film institute, VGIK, and in 1951 when he graduated, secured the entry to Soyuzmultfilm, where he stayed his entire career.

The current release is Cash Management Balance Reporting Specifications Version 2, typically referred to as BAI2. History In 1971, BAI created a precursor to the BAI format called the Lockbox Communications Standards for Banks, which supported reporting only for lockbox services. This standard was never updated and was eventually superseded by the BAI format. In 1980, BAI, working with various U.S. banks, released BAI1, the Cash Management Balance Reporting Specification, Version 1, the first release of cash management balance reporting specifications. Some banks still use BAI1, but BAI discontinued formal support after 1990. In 1987, the original specifications were replaced by BAI2. In 2001, the BAI2 specifications were updated to include new codes for lending transactions. Since the user base of the BAI format has reached critical mass and is considered self-supporting, BAI no longer actively supports (or charges for) the BAI format specifications, which are now freely available as a 104-page PDF document (see the external link below to the \\"Cash Management Balance Reporting Specifications\\").

Some guidebooks refer to it by its older scientific names of Entoloma lividum or Rhodophyllus sinuatus. The largest mushroom of the genus of pink-spored fungi known as Entoloma, it is also the type species. Appearing in late summer and autumn, fruit bodies are found in deciduous woodlands on clay or chalky soils, or nearby parklands, sometimes in the form of fairy rings. Solid in shape, they resemble members of the genus Tricholoma. The ivory to light grey-brown cap is up to 20 cm (8 in) across with a margin that is rolled inward. The sinuate gills are pale and often yellowish, becoming pink as the spores develop. The thick whitish stem has no ring. When young, it may be mistaken for the edible St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa) or the miller (Clitopilus prunulus). It has been responsible for many cases of mushroom poisoning in Europe. E. sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life- threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.  Name and relationships  Bulliard's original illustration of Agaricus lividus from his 1788 Champignon de la France, which has been found to be a depiction of alt=an old line drawing of the various parts of a mushroom fruit body The saga of this species' name begins in 1788 with the publication of part 8 of Jean Baptiste Bulliard's Herbier de la France. In it was plate 382, representing a mushroom which he called Agaricus lividus. In 1872, Lucien Qu√©let took up a species which he called \\"Entoloma lividus Bull.\\"; although all subsequent agree that this is a fairly clear reference to Bulliard's name, Qu√©let gave a description that is generally considered to be that of a different species from Bulliard's. In the meantime, 1801 had seen the description of Agaricus sinuatus by Christian Persoon in his Synopsis Methodica Fungorum. He based that name on another plate (number 579) published in the last part of Bulliard's work, and which the latter had labelled \\"agaric sinu√©\\".Which means that under the modern principles of nomenclature, Persoon, not Bulliard, is the first to have used the name, since only names in Latin can be considered. German mycologist Paul Kummer reclassified it as Entoloma sinuatum in 1871. For many years Qu√©let's name and description were treated as valid because Bulliard's name antedated Persoon's. However, in 1950, a change in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (termed the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused only names on fungi published after 1801 or 1821 (depending on their type) to be valid. This meant that suddenly Bulliard's name was no longer a valid name, and now it was Persoon's name that had priority. Nonetheless it was a well- known name, and the already chaotic situation caused by a change to a famous Latin name was further complicated by another of Qu√©let's suggestions. He had in 1886 proposed a new, broader genus that included all pink-gilled fungi with adnate or sinuate gills and angular spores: Rhodophyllus. These two approach to genus placement, using either Rhodophyllus or Entoloma, coexisted for many decades, with mycologists and guidebooks following either; Henri Romagnesi, who studied the genus for over forty years, favoured Rhodophyllus, as initially did Rolf Singer. However, most other authorities have tended to favor Entoloma, and Singer conceded the name was far more widely used and adopted it for his Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy text in 1986. In the meantime, it had been widely accepted that the 1950 change to the Stockholm Code caused more problems than they solved, and in 1981, the Sydney Code reinstated the validity of pre-1801 names, but created the status of sanctioned name for those used in the foundational works of Persoon and Elias Magnus Fries. Thus Entoloma sinuatum, which Fries had sanctioned, still had to be used for the species described by Qu√©let even though Bulliard's name was the older one. At about the same time, Machiel Noordeloos re-examined Bulliard's name in more details, and discovered that not only was it illegitimate (and thus not available for use) because William Hudson had already used it ten years earlier for a different species, but Bulliard's illustration was clearly not an Entoloma, but a species of Pluteus,It is now generally accepted the species in question is Pluteus cervinus. a genus that is only distantly related to Entoloma. As this made Qu√©let's name definitely unusable for the Entoloma, and because at the time he and Romagnesi believed there were ground to treat Qu√©let's \\"E. lividum\\" and Persoon's E. sinuatum as separate species, he had to coin a third name for Qu√©let's species: Entoloma eulividum. He however later changed his mind on this issue, combining again his own Entoloma eulividum and E. sinuatum, so that Persoon's name is now universally recognised. Because it was previously widely used and Qu√©let had provided a good description and illustration (which, the proposer argued, was better considered as a new species rather than a mere placement of Bulliard's name in another genus), a proposal was made in 1999 to conserve Entoloma lividum and thus restore its use. However, it failed because E. sinuatum had already been in use (if not universally) for many years and was thus a well- known name for the species. The specific epithet sinuatum is the Latin for \\"wavy\\", referring to the shape of the cap, while the generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words entos/·ºêŒΩœÑœåœÇ \\"inner\\" and l√≥ma/Œª·ø∂ŒºŒ± \\"fringe\\" or \\"hem\\" from the inrolled margin. The specific epithet lividum was derived from the Latin word lƒ´v«êdus \\"lead-coloured\\". The various common names include livid entoloma, livid agaric, livid pinkgill, leaden entoloma, lead poisoner, and grey pinkgill. In the Dijon region of France it was known as le grand empoisonneur de la C√¥te-d'Or (\\"the great poisoner of C√¥te d'Or\\"). Qu√©let himself, who was poisoned by the fungus, called it the miller's purge, akin to another common name of false miller. Within the large genus Entoloma, which contains around 1500 species, E. sinuatum has been classically placed in the section Entoloma within the subgenus Entoloma,Noordeloos, Fungi Europaei, p. 72. as it is the type species of the genus. A 2009 study analyzing DNA sequences and spore morphology found it to lie in a rhodopolioid clade with (among other species) E. sordidulum, E. politum and E. rhodopolium, and most closely related to E. sp. 1. This rhodopolioid clade lay within a crown Entoloma clade.  Description  alt=A whitish mushroom with pink gills occupies the foreground of a photo taken at ground level. In the background is a forest on a sunny day. The largest member of its genus, Entoloma sinuatum has an imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp), bearing a cap 6‚Äì20 cm (‚Äì6 in) wide, though diameters of 30 cm (10 in) have been recorded. It is convex to flat, often with a blunt umbo in its centre and wavy margins, ivory white to light grey-brown in color, and darkening with age. The distant gills are sinuate (notched at their point of attachment to the stipe) to almost free, generally (but not always) yellowish white before darkening to pink and then red. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stipe). When viewed from beneath, a characteristic groove colloquially known as a \\"moat\\" can be seen in the gill pattern circumnavigating the stalk. The form lacking yellow color on the gills is rare but widespread, and has been recorded from Austria, France and the Netherlands.Noordeloos, Fungi Europaei, p. 114. The stout white stipe lacks a ring and is anywhere from 4 to 20 cm (1.6‚Äì6 in) high, and 0.5‚Äì4 cm (0.2‚Äì1.6 in) in diameter. It may be bulbous at the base. The taste is mild, although it may be unpleasant. The mushroom's strong and unusual odor can be hard to describe; it may smell of flour, though is often unpleasant and rancid. The spore print is reddish-brown, with angular spores 8‚Äì11 √ó 7‚Äì9.5 Œºm, roughly six-sided and globular in shape. The basidia are four-spored and clamped. The gill edge is fertile, and cystidia are absent.Noordeloos, Fungi Europaei, pp. 111‚Äì13. Similar species Confusion with the highly regarded miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) is a common cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish -white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in color, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odor. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore color (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T. columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odor. E. sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E. sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.  Distribution and habitat  Entoloma sinuatum is fairly common and widespread across North America as far south as Arizona. It also occurs throughout Europe and the British Isles including Ireland, though it is more common in southern and central parts of Europe than the northwest. In Asia, it has been recorded in the Black Sea region, and Adƒ±yaman Province in Turkey, Iran, and northern Yunnan in China. The fruit bodies of E. sinuatum grow solitarily or in groups, and have been found forming fairy rings. Fruit bodies appear mainly in autumn, and also in summer in North America, while in Europe the season is reported as late summer and autumn. They are found in deciduous woodlands under oak, beech, and less commonly birch, often on clay or calcareous (chalky) soils, but they may spread to in parks, fields and grassy areas nearby. Most members of the genus are saprotrophic,Noordeloos, Fungi Europaei, p. 38. although this species has been recorded as forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with willow (Salix).  Toxicity  This fungus has been cited as being responsible for 10% of all mushroom poisonings in Europe. For example, 70 people required hospital treatment in Geneva alone in 1983, and the fungus accounted for 33 of 145 cases of mushroom poisoning in a five-year period at a single hospital in Parma. Poisoning is said to be mainly gastrointestinal in nature; symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and headache occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after consumption and last for up to 48 hours. Acute liver toxicity and psychiatric symptoms like mood disturbance or delirium may occur. Rarely, symptoms of depression may last for months. At least one source reports there have been fatalities in adults and children. Hospital treatment of poisoning by this mushroom is usually supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. Intravenous fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly.Benjamin, Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas, pp. 354‚Äì55. Metoclopramide may be used in cases of recurrent vomiting once gastric contents are emptied.Benjamin, Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas, p. 188. The identity of the toxin(s) is unknown, but chemical analysis has established that there are alkaloids present in the mushroom. A study of trace elements in mushrooms in the eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey found E. sinuatum to have the highest levels of copper (64.8 ¬± 5.9 Œºg/g dried material‚Äîinsufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198 Œºg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40 Œºg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.

The Louisville and Nashville Railroad was also an important link between the industrialized northern cities and the South. Louisville's importance to the shipping industry continues today with the presence of the Worldport air hub for UPS. The city's location at the crossroads of three major Interstate highways (I-64, I-65 and I-71) also contributes to its modern-day strategic importance to the shipping and cargo industry. In addition, the Port of Louisville continues Louisville's river shipping presence at Jefferson Riverport International. As of 2003, Louisville ranks as the seventh-largest inland port in the United States. Health care and medical sciences Louisville has emerged as a major center for the health care and medical sciences industries. Louisville has been central to advancements in heart and hand surgery as well as cancer treatment. Some of the first artificial heart and hand transplants were conducted in Louisville. The James Graham Brown Cancer Center is well-renowned. The city's thriving downtown medical research campus includes a new $88 million rehabilitation center and a health sciences research and commercialization park, that in partnership with the University of Louisville, has lured nearly 70 top scientists and researchers. Louisville is also home to Humana, one of the nation's largest health insurance companies. Product manufacturing: Automotive, home appliances, bourbon and more Louisville is a significant center of manufacturing. Within the city's limits are two major Ford plants, namely the Kentucky Truck Plant and the Louisville Assembly Plant. Also located in the city is the headquarters and major home appliance factory of GE Appliances (a subsidiary of Haier). The city is a major center of the American whiskey industry, with about one-third of all bourbon coming from Louisville. Brown-Forman, one of the major makers of American whiskey, is headquartered in Louisville and operates a distillery in the Louisville suburb of Shively. The current primary distillery site operated by Heaven Hill, called the Bernheim distillery, is also located in Louisville near Brown-Forman's distillery. Other distilleries and related businesses can also be found in neighboring cities in Kentucky, Barton 1792 (Bardstown), Jim Beam (Clermont), Wild Turkey (Lawrenceburg), or Maker's Mark (Loretto, with a restaurant/lounge in Louisville). Similar to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail that links these central Kentucky locations, Louisville offers tourists its own \\"Urban Bourbon Trail\\", where people can stop at nearly 20 \\"area bars and restaurants, all offering at least 50 labels of America's only native spirit.\\" Craft beer is an increasingly profitable business for the city, home to over 14 locally owned breweries including Bluegrass Brewing Company and Falls City Brewing Company. In 2013 overall beer sales were reported to be down 2% from the previous year, whereas craft beer sales had risen 18%. To keep up the demand, Mayor Greg Fischer announced in 2015 plans to create \\"Lou Brew\\": a tour, similar to the Urban Bourbon Trail, that will highlight the local breweries and craft beer scene of Louisville to both natives and tourists. High tech Not typically known for high tech outside of the previously identified industries, Louisville in the 2010s has been at or near the forefront of some high-tech- related developments. In April 2017, Google Fiber confirmed that the city will be wired for its ultrafast network. Meanwhile, since October 2016, AT&T; Fiber has been building out its similar service in the city as well as neighboring counties in Indiana. Beyond networking, the city, through its public‚Äìprivate partnership called Code Louisville, recognized by President Barack Obama, is aiding area residents in the learning of software coding skills. Independent businesses Louisville prides itself in its large assortment of small, independent businesses and restaurants, some of which have become known for their ingenuity and creativity. In 1926 the Brown Hotel became the home of the Hot Brown \\"sandwich\\". A few blocks away, the Seelbach Hotel, which F. Scott Fitzgerald references in The Great Gatsby, is also famous for a secret back room where Al Capone would regularly meet with associates during the Prohibition era. The room features a secret back door escape and was used as a starting point for rumrunners who would transport illegal moonshine from the hills of eastern Kentucky to Chicago. Also, in 1880, John Colgan invented a way to make chewing gum taste better for a longer period of time. The Highlands area of Louisville on Bardstown Road has many independent businesses, including the Preston Arts Center, Baxter Avenue Theater, Carmichael's book store, Heine Brothers' Coffee, John Conti Coffee, Wick's Pizza, Steilberg's String Instruments and O'Shea's Irish Pub, among others. Several local breweries such as Milewide Brewing, Gravely Brewing, Great Flood Brewery, Akasha, Apocolypse, Holsopple, New Albanian Brewery of New Albany, Indiana, Browning's Restaurant and Brewery, Cumberland Brews, and the Bluegrass Brewing Company offer an assortment of local brewing talent in the area. Other industries Louisville has connections to the entertainment industry. Several major motion pictures have also been filmed in or near Louisville, including The Insider, Goldfinger, Stripes, Lawn Dogs, Elizabethtown, Demolition Man, and Secretariat. Also located in Louisville is a branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Historical businesses Louisville for a long time was also home to the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company, at its peak one of the largest manufacturers and wholesale distributors of hardware in the United States, as well as Brown & Williamson, the third largest company in the tobacco industry before merging with R. J. Reynolds in 2004 to form the Reynolds American Company. Brands such as KOOL, Viceroy, Capri, Misty and Raleigh were introduced in Louisville. Brown & Williamson, one of the subjects of the tobacco industry scandals of the 1990s, was the focus of The Insider, a 1999 film shot around the Louisville area.

It runs for south-to-north in the western part of the state. The highway begins northeast of Eldorado, in the southwest corner of the state, and extends north to the Kansas state line between Woodward and Coldwater, Kansas. SH-34 has always been a lengthy highway, starting with its commissioning in June 1931, when it was a border-to-border highway stretching from Texas to Kansas. Most of SH-34 has followed the same basic corridor since its inception, with the exception of the portion of highway north of Woodward. The southernmost portion of highway, connecting it to Texas, became solely SH-6 in 1987. There are three letter-suffixed spur highways branching from SH-34. SH-34A and SH-34B serve small towns in Greer County off the mainline of SH-34, while SH-34C serves Boiling Springs State Park. Route description For much of its extent, State Highway 34 passes through rural areas, running through the plains of western Oklahoma. The highway begins at SH-6 six miles (10 km) northeast of Eldorado. Heading north from there, it intersects U.S. Route 62 (US-62) just east of Duke. The highway continues north into Greer County to its county seat of Mangum, where SH-34 joins US-283. Two miles (3 km) north of Mangum, SH-9 joins for a four-mile (6 km) concurrency with SH-34 and US-283. Thereafter, SH-9 splits off to the east. Nine miles (14 km) north of Mangum, SH-34B branches off to the west, connecting to the town of Brinkman, and four miles (6 km) later, SH-34A branches off to the west to the town of Willow. US-283 splits off to the northwest two miles (3 km) after that, and SH-34 continues north, crossing into Beckham County. SH-34 then bridges over the North Fork of the Red River. In Carter, the highway serves as the western terminus of SH-55. Five miles (8 km) north of Carter, SH-34 crosses SH-152. SH-34 continues on to an interchange with Interstate 40 (I-40) west of Elk City. Here, the highway begins a concurrency with eastbound I-40. SH-34 accesses I-40 from exit 32, a partial diamond interchange, with no access to or from I-40 eastbound; the missing movements must be completed via another partial interchange further to the east, also numbered as exit 32, which serves Business I-40 (I-40 BUS). SH-34 follows I-40 to the east for . While concurrent with I-40, SH-34 has an interchange with SH-6, its northernmost junction with the latter highway. SH-34 exits the interstate from the left at exit 41 on the east side of Elk City, turning back to the north and intersecting I-40 BUS. The highway continues north out of Elk City, exiting Beckham County. After leaving Beckham County, SH-34 enters Roger Mills County. SH-73's western terminus is at SH-34 at nine miles (14 km) north of Elk City. North of this junction, SH-34 lies along the Roger Mills‚ÄìCuster county line, which it continues to follow as it passes through the east side of Hammon, where it meets State Highway 33. North of town, the route crosses over the Washita River, and shortly thereafter turns northeast to fully enter Custer County. Northwest of Moorewood, the highway crosses into Dewey County. In Dewey County, SH-34 crosses SH-47, two miles (3 km) south of Leedey, and crosses the Canadian River near the unincorporated settlement of Trail. The highway then passes through Camargo. Just east of Vici, SH-34 joins US-60 and SH-51 for a one-mile (1.6 km) concurrency, then SH-34 heads north again at Vici. The highway passes through Sharon north of Vici, then joins US-183/US-270/SH-3 four miles (6 km) southeast of Woodward. At Woodward, SH-34 again sets off to the north alone, and right after crossing the North Canadian River, SH-34C branches to the east about two miles (3 km) north of Woodward, connecting to Boiling Springs State Park. SH-34 joins US-64 in far eastern Harper County for a four-mile (6 km) concurrency to the east, crossing the Cimarron River east of Buffalo. The highway then turns back to the north, where it is to its terminus at the Kansas state line. History State Highway 34 was first designated on June 15, 1931. At that time, the highway began at the free bridge over the Red River north of Quanah, Texas, and followed what is today SH-6 to the point that is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment did not differ significantly from that of the present day (although it followed US-66 through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until it got to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 of that day instead turned west, then north, passing through Fort Supply and crossing into Harper County just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, bringing it to the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway. SH-34 was rerouted north of Buffalo on January 30, 1934. The new alignment continued due north out of Buffalo to the Kansas state line along a new road. The old portion of SH-34 between US-64 and the Kansas state line became part of SH-50. The next major change to SH-34 occurred in 1954. On November 1 of that year, the highway was realigned to follow a new road extending north of Woodward, intersecting US-64 east of Buffalo, and following existing highways north to the state line. This would put SH-34 on its present-day route north of Woodward. SH-50 would remain concurrent with SH-34 north of US-64 until November 9, 1964. The next major change to SH-34 would be brought about by the establishment of the southern part of State Highway 6. The new highway was introduced on July 7, 1975. SH-34 remained in place; the two highways were concurrent from northwest of Eldorado to the Red River bridge, where they both ended. On January 5, 1987, the redundant section of SH-34 was removed, truncating it to its current southern terminus. The final modification to SH-34 occurred just under a month later, on February 2, 1987, when SH-34 was realigned in Elk City to follow I-40 instead of the old alignment of the now-dead US-66, which had become a business loop of I-40. No further changes have taken place since then. Junction list Spurs SH-34A SH-34A is a spur connecting SH-34 with Willow, north of Mangum. The highway begins at the west edge of Willow and follows Main Street east as it bisects the town. East of the town limits, the highway intersects US-283/SH-34 and ends. SH-34A first appeared on the 1944 state highway map. SH-34B SH-34B is a spur connecting SH-34 with Brinkman, north of Mangum. The highway follows Main Street from unincorporated Brinkman to US-283/SH-34. SH-34B first appeared on the 1944 state highway map. SH-34C SH-34C is a spur connecting SH-34 with Boiling Springs State Park north of Woodward. The highway heads east from SH-34, curving northeast near the park's golf course, before making a sharp turn toward the northeast. The highway ends on the west side of the park, with an access road continuing through it; on the east side of the park, the access road intersects SH-50B at its western terminus. The road that is currently SH-34C first appeared on the 1948 state highway map as SH-15A. At this time, the highway began at US-183/US-270/SH-15/SH-34 in Woodward and headed north, then turned east north of the city and headed to Boiling Springs State Park. When SH-34 was realigned north of Woodward on November 1, 1954, it took over the portion of SH-15A in Woodward, severing the highway's link to its parent. SH-15A had been renumbered as SH-34C by 1956. By 1957, the highway was extended east, passing through the park and continuing onward to SH-50. However, by 1959, the road through the park had been removed from the state highway system; the segment of highway east of the park was renumbered to SH-50B.

This story draws on Heinlein's early leftist ideas, and makes references to George Bernard Shaw's The Apple Cart. Summary The story concerns the invention of \\"light panels\\" ‚Äì devices which turn electrical power directly into light (similar to electroluminescent displays, invented in 1949). In the course of their discovery, the inventors also discover that these panels can also be used to derive power from light. In attempting to bring their discovery to market, they encounter the active opposition of the Power Syndicate, a conglomeration of energy-producing companies dedicated to preserving their monopoly on power production. Rather than trying to maintain a patent on their invention, the scientists then publicly release the scientific details of their discovery for a small royalty, allowing anyone to obtain their own power, and thus outwitting the Power Syndicate.

He finished his basic education and then completed his Master's degree in Urdu, Persian and English literature. Firaq had shown early signs of excellence in Urdu poetry and had always shown attraction towards literature. His contemporaries included famous Urdu poets like Allama Iqbal, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Kaifi Azmi and Sahir Ludhianvi. Yet he was able to make his mark in Urdu poetry at an early age. He was selected for the Provincial Civil Service (P.C.S.) and the Indian Civil Service (British India) (I.C.S.), but he resigned to follow Mahatma Gandhi's Non-cooperation movement, for which he went to jail for 18 months. Later, he joined Allahabad University as a lecturer in English literature. It was there that he wrote most of his Urdu poetry, including his magnum opus Gul-e-Naghma which earned him the highest literary award of India, the Jnanpith Award, and also the 1960 Sahitya Akademi Award in Urdu. During his life, he was given the positions of Research Professor at the University Grants Commission and Producer Emeritus by All India Radio. After a long illness, he died on 3 March 1982, in New Delhi. Gorakhpuri was well-versed in all traditional metrical forms such as ghazal, nazm, rubaai and qat'aa. He wrote more than a dozen volumes of Urdu poetry, a half dozen of Urdu prose, several volumes on literary themes in Hindi, as well as four volumes of English prose on literary and cultural subjects.

Isaac Leonard Ellwood (August 3, 1833 ‚Äì September 11, 1910) was an American rancher, businessman and barbed wire entrepreneur. Early life Ellwood was born in Salt Springville, New York. His first taste of business came as a young boy when he began selling sauerkraut. In 1851, Ellwood, like many others, headed west to the California Gold Rush. DeKalb, Illinois An advertising poster c. 1880s for Ellwood and Glidden's manufacturing firm. Ellwood found some success in California and returned east in 1855, to DeKalb, Illinois, where he opened a hardware and implements store. On January 27, 1859, Ellwood married Harriet Augusta Miller; the couple would ultimately have seven children. As Ellwood rose to prominence he began acquiring farm properties in and around DeKalb, Illinois. After the Civil War ended he began to import Percheron draft horses, many from France. Eventually, this resulted in a stock farm near DeKalb. Birth of barbed wire A specimen of Ellwood's hand made barbed wire. In late 1872, Waterman, Illinois farmer Henry Rose developed a wire fence with an attached wooden strip containing projecting wire points to dissuade encroaching livestock. He patented his fence in May, 1873 and exhibited it at the DeKalb County Fair that summer. This prompted Ellwood along with other DeKalb area residents Jacob Haish and Joseph Glidden to work on improving the concept. Ellwood patented a type of barbed wire in February 1874, but ever the businessman, concluded that Joseph Glidden's design was superior to his. He purchased one-half interest in Glidden's invention in July, 1874. Glidden's patent issued in November, and together they formed the I.L. Ellwood Manufacturing Company. In the beginning they produced two-strand, twisted barbed wire in the back of Ellwood's hardware store. The business was quickly successful. Ellwood's hiring John Warne Gates as a salesman propelled sales of barbed wire in Texas.History of barbed wire Ranchers in the west found their creation useful and much needed. As business and demand took off, the company expanded, reorganized and merged and a successful Ellwood began construction on his Victorian mansion, the Ellwood House. In 1881, I.L. Ellwood Manufacturing became Superior Barbed Wire Company under an expansion and reorganization plan. Seventeen years later the company would merge in the creation of John Warne Gates' American Steel and Wire monopoly, which was a predecessor of United States Steel. Support for higher education DeKalb is home to Northern Illinois University and Ellwood played a major role in making it a reality. It was Clinton Rosette who helped persuade Ellwood that the new Northern Illinois State Normal School should be in DeKalb. So convinced was Ellwood that he used all methods at his disposal to support the cause. His own capital, his time and his political influence were all used to gain DeKalb the new college. Governor John Altgeld appointed Ellwood to the Board of Trustees, who were responsible for selecting a site for the normal school. This allowed him to assert all the more political influence. In the name of securing the future school for DeKalb Ellwood reportedly donated $20,000 and fronted another $50,000 in a non-interest bearing loan, along with of land for the new school.NIU Founders : from Northern Illinois University The bid was ultimately successful and the normal school eventually became NIU. Texas ranching In the ensuing time Ellwood's interest in ranching grew. On a trip to Texas in 1889 he purchased the 130,000 acre (530 km¬≤) Renderbrook Ranch in Mitchell County. In 1891 he purchased an additional northwest of Lubbock, Texas. He acquired more area in 1902 and 1906 bringing his total holdings in Texas to . In all, at its height Spade Ranch and Ellwood's other Texas land holdings encompassed . He built a ten-room \\"cottage\\" in Port Arthur, Texas which was an authentic copy of a Pompeiian villa from 74 CE. Ellwood continued to acquire ranch land until almost the time he died, in Dekalb, Illinois in 1910. Trivia *The borough of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania is named after Isaac L.

The markets were widely known for having the finest meat in the San Francisco area, and the marketing strategies employed at the stores are still an inspiration for grocers nationwide. At the beginning of the 20th century grocery stores were sometimes much like department stores with different partners owning and operating their own departments. The founder started out operating the meat section of Lick Market on 7th and Clement in 1935 under such a scheme.; He opened three other markets within a few years of that time. The largest Petrini's grocery store was opened in 1956 on what is still known today as Petrini Plaza, near Fulton and Masonic in San Francisco. At the time of opening of that store, there were already four other large grocery stores in San Francisco. The original store located at 2001 McAllister Street was torn down in 1996 and replaced by an apartment complex called The Village at Petrini Place which included a Lucky Supermarket with underground parking. The Stonestown location continued to operate under the name Petrini's until 1996 but took heavy losses in 1993 although the Petrini Family sold the chain in 1989 to Canadian company Provigo Inc. In the 70s the grocery store that occupied the Stonestown Location was called QFI which stood for Quality Food Incorporated. QFI became Petrini's in 1982. The original grocery store before QFI was called the Stonestown Market. Petrini's markets were known as being the very best markets in the Northern California region for gourmet meats and food. The butchers were well trained and very well taken care of by the business. The founder of the market, Frank Petrini, considered each of the market's employees as family, and encouraged the employees to treat each other as such. He greeted customers he knew personally, which were most regular customers, with a hug and kiss. Frank Petrini carefully selected the cows that were to be slaughtered for sale in his markets himself, and rejected a majority of the bovine that were used for prime meat by other markets. Petrini's markets was the first large grocery store chain to specialize in quality gourmet food, and Frank Petrini thus created model that has been followed since by grocers both in the United States as well as in Japan, Australia and Europe. Some of the best selections of wine, coffee beans and European food in the San Francisco area was also found at Petrini's . Frank Petrini (third from right) and the butchers of one of the first stores in the 1950s Petrini's market was established by Frank Petrini, an Italian immigrant butcher from Lammari, Lucca. He began working at age 12 in Italy, and was trained to be a butcher at age 14. He travelled to the United States alone in 1922, being the first in his family to come. He came directly to San Francisco with $5 in his pocket and started immediately working as a butcher from 6am to 7pm every day. He originally wanted to go to college, but with the advice of a priest, who was the director of the English school he attended, he concentrated on becoming the best butcher in San Francisco. The Petrini's market advertisements were famous for containing inspiring quotes, which also appeared on the wall of his stores. These quotes earned him the nickname of \\"philosopher\\" among his friends. These quotes were collected into a book which was published by R&E; Publishing in September 1992 under the title of \\"The Proverbs of Frank Petrini: Food for Thought.\\"  References   External links  *News article in The Jewish News Weekly about a rabbi who encourages Petrini's to carry passover food *1958 picture of the meat counter in the flagship store in the SF Library Historical Archives *Another picture from the SF Library Historical Archives showing Frank Petrini picking out cows *Business Wire 1996 article about closing of store *Blog posting of Petrini's fan *WorldCat Library Catalog listing for \\"Food for Thought,\\" a book by the founder of Petrini's Category:Defunct supermarkets of the United States Category:Butcher shops Category:Food retailers of the United States Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Food and drink in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:History of San Francisco Category:History of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Italian-American culture in San Francisco Category:American companies established in 1935 Category:Retail companies established in 1935 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1989 Category:1935 establishments in California Category:1989 disestablishments in California Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Shops in the United States Category:Supermarkets based in California ","title":"Petrini's"},{"id":"7057521","text":"The Nowra Bridge is a road bridge that carries the Princes Highway over the Shoalhaven River, at Nowra in the Shoalhaven Council local government area, on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The bridge joins the main area of Nowra to North Nowra and Bomaderry.  Description  The bridge was originally intended to carry a double railway track, as part of the proposed extension of the South Coast line to Jervis Bay and possibly . However, the railway was never extended past Bomaderry station where trains still terminate today, so the bridge was converted for road traffic, as the residents of Nowra wanted a road bridge that connected Bomaderry to Nowra. The bridge was designed by American engineer Charles Shaler Smith and is considered to be of local historical significance. The bridge was completed in 1881 and is built from wrought iron with a steel approach span. The bridge had a timber deck for 100 years until in 1981 reinforced concrete was laid over steel Armco decking. The pairs of cast iron piers are original and were supplied locally by the Atlas Foundry, Sydney. It was the largest bridge project in New South Wales prior to the 1889 Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge. Its full length is . The two-lane bridge carries southbound traffic only. A newer concrete three-lane bridge carries northbound traffic on the Princes Highway.  Replacement bridge  In August 2019 Infrastructure Australia approved the construction of a new four-lane bridge immediately to the west (upriver) of the existing bridges. This new bridge would become the new crossing for northbound traffic. The existing northbound bridge would be converted for southbound traffic, allowing the bridge built in 1881 to be re-purposed for community uses. The replacement bridge is expected to cost 342 million; with funding to be shared between the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments, and the private sector.

They compete in the Mainland Premier League and they have won the league title on five occasions. Ferrymead Bays FC play their home games at Ferrymead Park in Ferrymead and Barnett Park in Redcliffs, Christchurch. The club colours are navy blue and white. Their club crest takes elements of the local suburbs and bays, featuring a football on waves. The club‚Äôs main rival is Cashmere Technical due to the club's close proximity and other recent rivals include Coastal Spirit. The club nickname is \\"The Bays\\", a reference to the club's several bays and coastal landmarks around that part of the city the club is located. The club crest first featured \\"Ferrymead Bays Soccer\\" around the ball and changed to \\"Ferrymead Bays Football\\" due to the modern reference to game's name.  History  The Club was formed in 1972 by a group of six enthusiasts. By 1986 the Club typically entered 8 to 10 teams in the Canterbury Junior Football Assn Competitions, compared to the 42 teams we now have plus about 100 children in the beginners group. Prior to 1997, the \\"A\\" teams in each grade normally played in Section 2 and often would win that section. However, it was rare for the \\"A\\" teams to stay in Section 1. This has changed after 1997 and a number of \\"A\\" teams have played in Section 1 for extended periods. The increase in playing numbers and competitiveness has been due mostly to the continued housing development in the area and the introduction of the beginners group in 1990. Developing the football skills at an early age appears to have had flow-on benefits both in terms of playing numbers and competitiveness. The Club has had the use of one senior pitch at Barnett Park from the outset. The junior pitches at Redcliffs Park and McCormacks Bay ten years ago left a lot to be desired ‚Äì they were uneven with ponds! The City Council has made dramatic improvements to McCormacks Bay Park over recent years and we are grateful for this work. Hockey used to have two pitches at Barnett Park but these were used less as more hockey games were played on artificial surfaces at Porritt Park. With the expansion in soccer teams, there was a need for more home grounds and the CCC agreed we could have full use of Barnett Park which now has two senior, two junior and one intermediate pitches. The consolidation at Barnett Park was helped by installing the practice lights in 1996 which have been a great asset. The Club started out as Bays United AFC but the name was expanded to include Ferrymead to identify with the rapid expanding commercial area and its sponsorship opportunities plus to give a geographical location and avoid the confusion where some thought Bays meant Banks Peninsula Bays and included Akaroa! Bays reached the top in 2002 with the First Team winning the Mainland Premier League having won promotion from division 1 the year before. Bays 1sts also won the Mainland Premier League for a second time when they were victorious in 2006. During the 2011 and 2012 season campaigns Ferrymead Bays won the league title on both occasions and again in 2017. 2012 Season During the 2012 season the club won four pieces of silverware including the Mainland Premier League, English Cup, South Island Football Championship and the Hurley Shield making the club the most successful in Christchurch in terms of Mainland Premier League titles. 2013 Season The 2013 season saw Ferrymead Bays looking for a hat-trick of Mainland Premier League titles. The season finished with Ferrymead Bays coming in 3rd place as local rivals Cashmere Technical won the title with a total of 49 points and Nelson Suburbs finishing second with 41 points. Ferrymead Bays did however manage to retain the English Cup title beating rivals Coastal Spirit 2-1 in the final at ASB Park. Goals came from golden boot Russell Kamo and James O'Sullivan with goalkeeper Adam Highfield being awarded Man of the Match in the final. 2013 would also mark the end of coach Mick Braithwaite's successful tenure at the club. He had made the suggestion of going into retirement in the later half of the season to a number of individuals at the club. 2014 Season Prior to the 2014 Mainland Premier League Season, Ferrymead Bays were pleased to announce that Danny Halligan would be the new manager at the club as of the 2014 season. Danny Halligan represented New Zealand at international level and he ended his international playing career with 36 international caps and five goals to his credit. Ferrymead finished the 2014 season as they did in 2013 finishing in 3rd place with 34 points with rivals Cashmere Technical winning their second consecutive Premier League title levelling Ferrymead's number of titles with four.

Its rhizomes are heavily marked with maroon and have the shape of the C. indica side of the family, as do the leaves. The colour of the flower comes from the Crozy side, but the petal form is heavily influenced by the thinner and larger C. flaccida blooms. At the time of its introduction, the breeder C.

It was invented by computer journalist David D. Busch, and billed as the \\"world's leading supplier of fictitious hardware, software, firmware, and limpware\\". Each month a new \\"innovation\\" was introduced that poked fun at the infant personal computer industry. These included a \\"black phosphor\\" computer monitor, and a programming language with all the worst features of BASIC and COBOL, called BASBOL. The fictional company's flagship product was the TLS-8E, a computer which was sold with a factory-applied coating of oxidation on its peripheral edge card connectors (\\"to protect them from electricity\\"), a 5-inch \\"sloppy\\" disk drive, and a keyboard that eschewed the familiar QWERTY array for a 16-key matrix that included a TBA (To Be Announced) key. According to Busch, the operation was founded by one \\"Scott Nolan Hollerith\\" (after Adventure programmer Scott Adams, Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, and computer pioneer Herman Hollerith). S.N. Hollerith, it was said, graduated from the University of California at Phoenix in 1970 with a degree in Slide Rule Design, and quickly built KTI into a multi-thousand-dollar empire on a foundation of selling maintenance upgrades for DROSS-DOS 8E, a microcomputer operating system that was a subset of CP/M. In 1981, KTI introduced the world's \\"first\\" 32-bit microprocessor, created by piggy-backing two 16-bit chips on top of each other, until it was discovered that, at best, only one of the two chips actually functioned at any given time and, at worst, they spent a lot of time fighting over whose turn it was. The KTI staff gradually phased Hollerith out of active participation by relocating to a new, high-tech facility in Cupertino, California, and not telling him where it was. Many of the phony products \\"introduced\\" by Kitchen Table International were actually introduced later. Several years after the company demonstrated its Reverse LPRINT command, which allowed a dot-matrix printer to function as a scanner (the demo was actually a videotape run backwards, showing sheets of text feeding into a printer and coming out blank after they had been \\"scanned\\"), Thunderware introduced the Thunderscan scanner, which replaced the ribbon cartridge of an Apple ImageWriter with a scanning module. Sorry About The Explosion! The Kitchen Table columns won the only Best Fiction Book award from the Computer Press Association for Busch in 1985, when he collected, revised, and edited the existing columns and some new material into a book, Sorry About The Explosion! published by Prentice-Hall. Never a best-seller, it achieved cult status largely from the popularity of the monthly KTI columns. The title of the book came from the subject line of a \\"memo\\" in the book from KTI R & D director Otto Wirk to company president Scott Nolan Hollerith sheepishly explaining that the organization's latest product had an MTBE (Mean Time Between Explosions) of only 100 hours. Although not as pointed as the classic The Devil's DP Dictionary by Stan Kelly-Bootle, the book, and the Kitchen Table International columns it was largely based upon, poked fun at the foibles of companies like Apple Computer, Radio Shack, Commodore, and Atari in an era when the early computer magazines were filled with technical articles, code listings, and discussions of the latest and greatest hardware, and not much regular humor. When the KTI column ceased publication in July, 1983, Busch collected all the existing material, reorganized it by topic, and wrote new pieces to produce Sorry About The Explosion!.

Stephen Slesinger (December 25, 1901\\"United States Social Security Death Index\\", index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JR37-ZJ6 : accessed 19 Mar 2013), Stephen Slesinger, December 1953. ‚Äì December 17, 1953) was an American radio, television and film producer, creator of comic strip characters and the father of the licensing industry. From 1923 to 1953, he created, produced, published, developed, licensed or represented several popular literary legends of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Biography Stephen Slesinger was born on December 25, 1901, in New York; He was a third generation New Yorker of Hungarian and Russian ancestry. His father, Anthony, was a dress manufacturer. His mother, Augusta (n√©e Singer), was a children's social worker, the Director of the Seward Guidance Bureau, and a published researcher for The NY Dept. of Education, for 40 years. Later she became the executive secretary of Jewish Big Sisters and a noted psychoanalyst. She was also one of the founders of The New School for Social Research. Slesinger studied at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School from September 1914 until June 1919 and later attended Columbia University. His younger sister was the author and screenwriter Tess Slesinger. Media pioneer In 1927, Slesinger set up shop in New York as a literary agent, and went on to represent, among others, Newbery Medal-winning writers Hendrik Willem van Loon (who won the first Newbery Medal in 1922), Western authors Zane Grey and Rex Beach, Will James and journalist Andy Rooney. Slesinger acquired the rights to popularize illustrations, texts, characters and personalities in other media, a pioneering effort into ancillary rights uses and licensing. Always interested in new media, Slesinger took out patents for television presentations of comic strips, and experimented with broadcasting Winnie the Pooh as the first Sunday morning TV cartoon in the mid-1940s. An April 23, 1946 New York Times article, \\"'Telecomic' Films Shown: Exhibition Held in Connection with Publishers' Meeting\\", described Slesinger's demonstration of film versions of the Sunday comics, including Dick Tracy, Otto the King and \\"a synoptic version of a popular children's book\\". \\"No attempt to televise the film, which was in color, was made, but Stephen Slesinger, president of the group sponsoring the demonstration, said that experiments had been carried on through that medium successfully on the West Coast since 1944.\\" Winnie-the-Pooh In 1930, Slesinger acquired sole and exclusive US and Canadian merchandising, television, recording and other trade rights to Winnie-the-Pooh from A. A. Milne,Johnson, David. \\"The 80-Year Struggle For Control Over Winnie The Pooh\\". Business Insider, July 15, 2011. and developed Winnie-the-Pooh commercializations for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, US radio broadcast (NBC), animation, and motion picture film. In the 1950s, after Slesinger's death, his widow, Shirley Slesinger Lasswell, took over the business and launched her own nationwide licensing campaigns. In 1961 and 1983, Stephen Slesinger, Inc. licensed certain of its Pooh rights to the Walt Disney Company. Premiums and products In 1933, Slesinger acquired the merchandising rights to Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan character and produced a series of Big Little Books, games, premiums, toys, treasure maps and other products. Slesinger's marketing and media strategy for Tarzan became the blueprint for success in character merchandising, including the campaigns Superman. Slesinger's The New Adventures of Tarzan \\"Pop-Up\\" (Blue Ribbon Press, 1935) book, which he also illustrated, was chosen by Albert Tillman as one of the 100 best pop-up books ever published and featured on the cover of Tillman's historical survey, Pop- Up! Pop-Up! (Whalestooth, 1998). Slesinger purchased the rights to the Ozark Ike comic strip from creator Rufus A. (\\"Ray\\") Gotto. In 1936, it became his first comic strip in syndication. Other personalities and characters curated by Slesinger with innovative media and merchandise campaigns include Tom Mix, Zane Grey's King of the Royal Mounted, Alley Oop, Captain Easy, Wash Tubbs, Polly the Powers Model, Charlie Chan, Buck Rogers and Og, Son of Fire, Blondie and Dagwood (for television), as well as all Newspaper Enterprise Association comic strips. For these and many others, he produced comic books, children's books and created the art and stories for hundreds of Big Little Books distributed by Western Printing and Lithograph, from the 1930s through the 1950s. Original characters In the late 1930s, Slesinger began developing original characters, which he then hired artists to bring to life. Most prominent among these are Red Ryder and King of the Royal Mounted, which became Slesinger's most popular characters, syndicated internationally in newspaper comic strips and also generating books, radio shows, motion pictures and numerous ancillary commercial products. Red Ryder and Little Beaver Working with artist Fred Harman, who came from Pagosa Springs, Colorado, Slesinger launched the popular comic strip Red Ryder. The strip's artistic style evolved from Harman's 1937 comic strip, Bronc Peeler. The two worked on the project for a year before Red Ryder was launched in 1938. Between 1938 and 1967, the long-running Red Ryder comic strip was also a un comic book, the subject of 12 chapter films, 26 motion pictures and numerous merchandising and promotional tie-ins, including the Red Ryder Daisy Carbine Air Rifle, which holds the longest continuing license in the history of the licensing industry and was depicted in the film A Christmas Story (1983). King of the Royal Mounted In 1937 Slesinger licensed Zane Grey's byline and created King of the Royal Mounted, the adventures of a Canadian Mountie who always got his man. King appeared in newspaper strips, comics, Little Big Books and other ancillary items. Grey's son Romer and Slesinger collaborated on many of the stories, and the artwork was produced by Allen Dean and in Slesinger's New York studio. A movie serial was produced in 1942. Television and films In 1940 Slesinger licensed to Republic Pictures the right to produce a 12-chapter Red Ryder serial and 23 Red Ryder motion pictures from 1944 to 1947. These were followed by four Red Ryder motion pictures produced, in CineColor, by Eagle Lion, 1949 to 1950. Slesinger also produced three Red Ryder Television pilots, two of which were completed and one remained uncut at the time of Slesinger's death. In 1963, by arrangement with Red Ryder Enterprises, Inc., Gunsmoke aired an episode entitled \\"I Call Him Wonder.\\" It was designed as a test for a Red Ryder and Little Beaver Television series. Red Ryder Enterprises, Inc., was created by Slesinger's wife, Shirley, shortly after Slesinger's passing. It currently holds the trademarks and copyrights in the Red Ryder character franchise, as well as original Western and Adventure archives art and story content. In the mid-1940s through the early 1950s, Stephen Slesinger Productions began producing films and television programs, including adaptations of Winnie-the-Pooh, Red Ryder, King of the Royal Mounted and The West That Lives Forever. He also formed Telecomics Presents, which displayed scripted comic strip segments as static images instead of animation. There were approximately 130 episodes produced, each lasting about three minutes. Each episode began with the opening of a comic book, the first page showing a silhouette of the lead character (Space Barton, Danny March or Kid Champion); the page then turned to show a full-page illustration. Telecomics is generally noted as one of the first cartoon series produced for television. In 1950, NBC optioned Telecomics' product and repackaged it as NBC Comics. Blondie In 1951, Slesinger acquired rights to make a Blondie television series with Arthur Lake as Dagwood Bumstead and his real-life wife Patricia \\"Pat\\" Lake starring as Blondie. at the request of Randolph Hearst who cared for her as if she was his daughter.

Acknowledged as one of the greatest players of his era, Rioli was one of the first Indigenous Australian footballers to have a significant impact on Victorian football, and was named in the centre for the Indigenous Team of the Century. A highly skilled and solidly built centreman with exquisite ball-handling skills and lightning reflexes, Rioli was a renowned performer on the big stage. After retiring from football, Rioli became a politician in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and then worked in community services on the Tiwi Islands. Early days Northern Territory Born into a famous footballing family on Melville Island off the coast of the Northern Territory, the young Rioli learnt the game at the Garden Point Orphanage on the island. He was educated at St John's College, Darwin. He joined St Mary's in the Darwin competition for the 1974‚Äì75 season; football in the top end is played during the summer months, or 'wet season'. Richard Woodgate a scout from the South Fremantle club in Perth spotted the sixteen-year-old and lured him to Western Australia to join his brother for the coming season. At this stage in his sporting life, Rioli was also an excellent amateur boxer, who some thought good enough to go to represent Australia at the Olympics. He later won state amateur titles at light middleweight and welterweight.Butler, Steve; The Day I Punched out Jacko; Pre Game; The West Australian; 11 April 2008 Western Australia Rioli chose to sign on with South Fremantle as a professional footballer and quickly won a reputation as brilliant, elusive centreman. During this era, Rioli was one of a number of brilliant Aboriginal players in the WAFL who caught the eyes of recruiting scouts from the VFL clubs in Victoria. South Fremantle, under ex-Richmond player Mal Brown, were a form team of the competition, playing in three consecutive WAFL grand finals between 1979 and 1981, including winning a premiership in 1980. Rioli won the Simpson Medal as best player afield in the 1980 and 1981 Grand Finals. Rioli was recruited by Richmond for the 1982 VFL season, after playing 121 games for South Fremantle between 1975 and 1981. Impact in Victoria To this point, few Aboriginal players had had extended careers in the VFL. On his arrival in 1982, which coincided with the transfer of the Krakouer brothers to North Melbourne, Rioli spoke about the racial taunts and obstacles faced by Indigenous players in the game. Rioli chose to shrug much of the racism off, and he was certainly possessed with an intense concentration on the field. His reputation as a boxer probably helped to avoid confrontation during a game ‚Äì Rioli was a scrupulously fair competitor who found no trouble with the umpires. Richmond Richmond awarded Rioli the number 17 made famous by Jack Dyer. Richmond supporters quickly warmed to their much-heralded recruit, who specialised in the audacious baulk, the pinpoint foot pass and the lightning- fast handball. His ability to work the ball out of packs and congestion was uncanny. Although his leg speed wasn't very fast, his quick mind appeared several steps ahead of the play and he had no problem adjusting to the faster tempo of Victorian football. It was just as well, because the Tigers opted to play him in his favoured centre position where Geoff Raines had dominated. For the previous five years, Raines had been the best player in the team (winning three best and fairest awards) and acknowledged as the best centreman in the competition, but he was moved to accommodate Rioli. The change worked well, and Richmond finished the season on top of the ladder for the first time since 1974. The Tigers booked a berth in the Grand Final with a comfortable win in the semi-final against arch-rivals . Pitted once more against Carlton, Richmond went into the match as slight favourites. However, despite leading at half-time, the Tigers lost the match. Rioli created history by winning the Norm Smith Medal as best afield, the first Indigenous player and the first player from a losing team to do so; when combined with his consecutive Simpson Medals from the 1980 and 1981 WAFL Grand Finals, Rioli had been best on ground in three consecutive Grand Finals. Shortly after, Rioli won the Jack Dyer Medal as the club's best and fairest to cap off an amazing first season. But problems lay immediately ahead. Raines approached the club and requested a contract commensurate with Rioli's earnings. When refused, Raines walked out and asked for a clearance to . Other prominent players fell into financial dispute with the club and left. Rapidly falling from the success of 1982, the decimated team struggled and finished third-last in 1983. Rioli, however, had another stellar season, again winning the best and fairest, finishing runner- up in the Brownlow medal, gaining Western Australian and All-Australian selection, and winning the Simpson Medal for his state of origin performance. An acknowledged star of the game and arguably the best player at the club, Rioli continued to stand out in a mediocre team. He represented Australia in Gaelic football against Ireland, and was an immediate choice for Western Australia in state of origin matches. However, after finishing second in the Richmond best and fairest in 1985, his days there soon looked set to end. In the summer of 1985‚Äì86, the new private owner of the Sydney Swans, flamboyant and controversial doctor Geoff Edelsten, had been frantically signing talent on massive contracts to play for his team. Rioli was announced as one of his many signings. It was the salary cap that saved Rioli from leaving for Sydney. After rumours that he would either join or return to South Fremantle, he eventually returned to the Tigers midway through the 1986 season. Rioli performed patchily through the season and the next, when Richmond finished last for only the third time in its history. Rioli captained Western Australia in the state game that year against his teammate Dale Weightman, who led Victoria.  Return to South Fremantle and Later career  Following the 1987 season, at 30 years of age and after 118 games with the Tigers, Rioli decided that his time in Melbourne was up and headed back to South Fremantle to be appointed as captain for the 1988 and 1989 seasons. In his absence, the football landscape in the west had altered dramatically with the formation of the West Coast Eagles. Rioli opted to play at the lower level, and the scheduling of seasons allowed him to captain-coach the Waratahs club in Darwin during the summer. He was still good enough to win All-Australian honours for a third time after the 1988 Bicentennial Carnival. Rioli played in the 1989 WAFL Grand Final, but South Fremantle went down to Claremont. In 1990, he finished as a player in Perth after 166 games for South Fremantle, but he continued as a player in Darwin until 1991. He followed that with a two-year stint as non-playing coach of the Waratahs. In 1993, he was invited by the AFL to present the Norm Smith medal at the Grand Final. Fittingly, it was won by another Territorian Aboriginal, Michael Long (Essendon), who had played at St Mary's in Darwin, where Rioli had started his senior football a generation before.  Post-Career accolades  In 2004, Rioli was inducted into the WA Football Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was posthumously inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The grandstand of the Marrara Oval in Darwin has been named in his honour. In 2018, he was posthumously honoured with a Richmond life membership. Politics and community work After permanently relocating with his family to Darwin, Rioli was elected as the member for Arafura in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for the Labor Party in 1992. He held this position until 2001 when he retired from parliament. Although he played football for almost a decade in Perth and only six years in Melbourne, Rioli is still recognised as one of the best-known Northern Territorians. He was a trailblazer for indigenous Australian football players at the elite level of the game and was an acknowledged elder statesman among Aboriginal players. After leaving politics, Rioli worked as a Community Services manager for the Tiwi Islands Council until his death, as well as spending his personal time mentoring young footballers. Family In 1972, Maurice's older brother Sebastian Rioli, became one of the first Aboriginal footballers from the Northern Territory to move to Western Australia to play football for South Fremantle. Maurice followed in 1975 and became the most successful footballer of the eight Rioli brothers. Brothers Cyril Jr and Willie also played league football for South Fremantle, and John, Manny and Laurence also moved to Fremantle, but returned to Darwin without playing senior football. Willie was drafted by in 1990, but did not make his AFL debut. Maurice is the uncle of former player Cyril Rioli (son of Cyril Jr),current player Willie Rioli (son of Willie Sr), former player Dean Rioli (son of Sebastian) and great uncle to Richmond rookie Daniel Rioli who was picked up in the 2015 draft.Bloodlines: The Rioli Family Message Stick, ABC TV His son, Maurice Jr. represented the Northern Territory at 2017's AFL Under 16 Championships. Death On Christmas Day 2010 Maurice Rioli collapsed and died at a family barbecue being held in Darwin, after suffering a heart attack; he was 53. The Northern Territory Government announced a few days later that they would hold a state funeral for him. Tributes Upon the announcement of his death, tributes flowed in from around the country, in particular throughout the football world. Richmond chief executive Brendon Gale immediately extended condolences on behalf of Rioli's former club, saying: > Maurice was an enormously important figure in the game as a player, and more > broadly in the leading role he played for Aboriginal Australians. He will be > remembered as one of the greatest players in the Tigers' proud history. Former teammate and club legend Dale Weightman stated: > Maurice was the cream of the crop. You couldn't tackle him, you couldn't > touch him, but he was also a great tackler. He also did so much for > Aboriginal players. He was always thinking about his people. On behalf of the AFL, chief executive officer Andrew Demetriou said on Boxing Day: > ... he was a wonderful skilled player who could control a game. He was the > trailblazer for footballers from the Northern Territory in making their mark > in the VFL and the AFL and he continued to serve his community long after > his playing days, with his work in public life.

He was just one of the greatest natural talents I have ever seen. He was the best tackler in his day and is still the best tackler I have ever seen.\\" Richmond legend and Rioli's first coach at the Tigers, Francis Bourke, and former teammate and star player Geoff Raines, were amongst others to also pay tribute to Rioli in the days after his death. Funerals Rioli's state funeral was held at St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin on 7 January 2011. The funeral was a Catholic service said by the Bishop of Darwin, Eugene Hurley, but hundreds of Aboriginal mourners also paid their respects through traditional \\"sorry business\\", with faces painted, clapping sticks, and wailing throughout the ceremony. Many football identities, including AFL coaching great and noted champion of Indigenous players, Kevin Sheedy, attended the service. A traditional funeral was held for Rioli at Garden Point on Melville Island on 10 January 2011, led by his 75-year-old father Cyril Rioli senior, and attended by hundreds of residents from the Tiwi Islands. Family members, including nephew and Hawthorn star Cyril Rioli, painted their bodies and danced and chanted their family's Dreaming story of the turtle to farewell Maurice. Cyril said that he remembered his uncle more for his work on the Tiwi Islands‚Äîincluding helping people with alcohol, drug, and other problems‚Äîrather than his exploits on the football field. Other clans danced their own Dreaming stories, and wailing men and women threw themselves on his coffin throughout the three-hour ceremony. Following the funeral proceedings, mourners carried Rioli's coffin to the cemetery, where he was buried near a mango tree.

Conformal contact is made with the substrate and pattern is left behind. Microcontact printing (or ŒºCP) is a form of soft lithography that uses the relief patterns on a master polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp to form patterns of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of ink on the surface of a substrate through conformal contact as in the case of nanotransfer printing (nTP). Its applications are wide-ranging including microelectronics, surface chemistry and cell biology. History Both lithography and stamp printing have been around for centuries. However, the combination of the two gave rise to the method of microcontact printing. The method was first introduced by George M. Whitesides and Amit Kumar at Harvard University. Since its inception many methods of soft lithography have been explored. Procedure Preparing the master Creation of the master, or template, is done using traditional photolithography techniques. The master is typically created on silicon, but can be done on any solid patterned surface. Photoresist is applied to the surface and patterned by a photomask and UV light. The master is then baked, developed and cleaned before use. In typical processes the photoresist is usually kept on the wafer to be used as a topographic template for the stamp. However, the unprotected silicon regions can be etched, and the photoresist stripped, which would leave behind a patterned wafer for creating the stamp. This method is more complex but creates a more stable template. Creating the PDMS stamp After fabrication the master is placed in a walled container, typically a petri dish, and the stamp is poured over the master. The PDMS stamp, in most applications, is a 10:1 ratio of silicone elastomer and a silicone elastomer curing agent. This mixture consists of a short hydrosilane crosslinker that contains a catalyst made from a platinum complex. After pouring, the PDMS is cured at elevated temperatures to create a solid polymer with elastomeric properties. The stamp is then peeled off and cut to the proper size. The stamp replicates the opposite of the master. Elevated regions of the stamp correspond to indented regions of the master. Some commercial services for procuring PDMS stamps and micropatterned samples exist such as Innopsys or Research Micro Stamps. Inking the stamp Inking of the stamp occurs through the application of a thiol solution either by immersion or coating the stamp with a Q-tip. The highly hydrophobic PDMS material allows the ink to be diffused into the bulk of the stamp, which means the thiols reside not only on the surface, but also in the bulk of the stamp material. This diffusion into the bulk creates an ink reservoir for multiple prints. The stamp is let dry until no liquid is visible and an ink reservoir is created. Applying the stamp to the substrate Direct contact Applying the stamp to the substrate is easy and straightforward which is one of the main advantages of this process. The stamp is brought into physical contact with the substrate and the thiol solution is transferred to the substrate. The thiol is area-selectively transferred to the surface based on the features of the stamp. During the transfer the carbon chains of the thiol align with each other to create a hydrophobic self-assembling monolayer (SAM). Other application techniques Printing of the stamp onto the substrate, although not used as often, can also take place with a rolling stamp onto a planar substrate or a curved substrate with a planar stamp. Advantages Microcontact Printing has several advantages including: *The simplicity and ease of creating patterns with micro-scale features *Can be done in a traditional laboratory without the constant use of a cleanroom (cleanroom is needed only to create the master). *Multiple stamps can be created from a single master *Individual stamps can be used several times with minimal degradation of performance *A cheaper technique for fabrication that uses less energy than conventional techniques *Some materials have no other micro patterning method available Technical problems with microcontact printing After this technique became popular various limitations and problems arose, all of which affected patterning and reproducibility. Stamp Deformation Figure 3: roof collapse, left, and buckling right can occur during the process During direct contact one must be careful because the stamp can easily be physically deformed causing printed features that are different from the original stamp features. Horizontally stretching or compressing the stamp will cause deformations in the raised and recessed features. Also, applying too much vertical pressure on the stamp during printing can cause the raised relief features to flatten against the substrate. These deformations can yield submicron features even though the original stamp has a lower resolution. Deformation of the stamp can occur during removal from the master and during the substrate contacting process. When the aspect ratio of the stamp is high buckling of the stamp can occur. When the aspect ratio is low roof collapse can occur. Substrate contamination During the curing process some fragments can potentially be left uncured and contaminate the process. When this occurs the quality of the printed SAM is decreased. When the ink molecules contain certain polar groups the transfer of these impurities is increased. Shrinking/swelling of the stamp During the curing process the stamp can potentially shrink in size leaving a difference in desired dimensions of the substrate patterning. Swelling of the stamp may also occur. Most organic solvents induce swelling of the PDMS stamp. Ethanol in particular has a very small swelling effect, but many other solvents cannot be used for wet inking because of high swelling. Because of this the process is limited to apolar inks that are soluble in ethanol. Ink mobility Ink diffusion from the PDMS bulk to the surface occurs during the formation of the patterned SAM on the substrate. This mobility of the ink can cause lateral spreading to unwanted regions. Upon the transfer this spreading can influence the desired pattern. Applications Depending on the type of ink used and the subsequent substrate the microcontact printing technique has many different applications Micromachining Microcontact printing has great applications in micromachining. For this application inking solutions commonly consist of a solution of alkanethiol. This method uses metal substrates with the most common metal being gold. However, silver, copper, and palladium have been proven to work as well. Once the ink has been applied to the substrate the SAM layer acts as a resist to common wet etching techniques allowing for the creation of high resolution patterning. The patterned SAMs layer is a step in a series of steps to create complex microstructures. For example, applying the SAM layer on top of gold and etching creates microstructures of gold. After this step etched areas of gold exposes the substrate which can further be etched using traditional anisotropic etch techniques. Because of the microcontact printing technique no traditional photolithography is needed to accomplish these steps. Patterning proteins The patterning of proteins has helped the advancement of biosensors., cell biology research, and tissue engineering. Various proteins have been proven to be suitable inks and are applied to various substrates using the microcontact printing technique. Polylysine, immunoglobulin antibody, and different enzymes have been successfully placed onto surfaces including glass, polystyrene, and hydrophobic silicon. Patterning cells Microcontact printing has been used to advance the understanding of how cells interact with substrates. This technique has helped improve the study of cell patterning that was not possible with traditional cell culture techniques. Patterning DNA Successful patterning of DNA has also been done using this technique. The reduction in time and DNA material are the critical advantages for using this technique. The stamps were able to be used multiple times that were more homogeneous and sensitive than other techniques. Technique improvements To help overcome the limitations set by the original technique several alternatives have been developed. *High-Speed printing: Successful contact printing was done on a gold substrate with a contact time in the range of milliseconds. This printing time is three orders of magnitude shorter than the normal technique, yet successfully transformed the pattern. The process of contact was automated to achieve these speeds through a piezoelectric actuator. At these low contact times the surface spreading of thiol did not occur, greatly improving the pattern uniformity *Submerged Printing: By submerging the stamp in a liquid medium stability was greatly increased. By printing hydrophobic long-chain thiols underwater the common problem of vapor transport of the ink is greatly reduced. PDMS aspect ratios of 15:1 were achieved using this method, which was not accomplished before *Lift-off Nanocontact printing: By first using Silicon lift-off stamps and later low cost polymer lift-off stamps and contacting these with an inked flat PDMS stamp, nanopatterns of multiple proteins or of complex digital nanodot gradients with dot spacing ranging from 0 nm to 15 um apart were achieved for immunoassays and cell assays. Implementation of this approach led to the patterning of a 100 digital nanodot gradient array, composed of more than 57 million protein dots 200 nm in diameter printed in 10 minutes in a 35 mm2 area. *Contact Inking: as opposed to wet inking this technique does not permeate the PDMS bulk. The ink molecules only contact the protruding areas of the stamp that are going to be used for the patterning. The absence of ink on the rest of the stamp reduces the amount of ink transferred through the vapor phase that can potentially affect the pattern. This is done by the direct contact of a feature stamp and a flat PDMS substrate that has ink on it. *New Stamp Materials: To create uniform transfer of the ink the stamp needs to be both mechanically stable and also be able to create conformal contact well. These two characteristics are juxtaposed because high stability requires a high Young's modulus while efficient contact requires an increase in elasticity. A composite, thin PDMS stamp with a rigid back support has been used for patterning to help solve this problem. *Magnetic field assisted micro contact printing: to apply a homogeneous pressure during the printing step, a magnetic force is used. For that, the stamp is sensitive to a magnetic field by injecting iron powder into a second layer of PDMS. This force can be adjusted for nano and micro-patterns \\"Magnetic field assisted microcontact printing: A new concept of fully automated and calibrated process\\", Jean- Christophe Cau, Lafforgue Ludovic, Nogues Marie, Lagraulet Adriana, Paveau Vincent, Microelectronic Engineering,Volume 110, October 2013, Pages 207‚Äì214|DOI: 10.1016/j.mee.2013.03.164 [13][12][12][12].

He competed in the Motocross World Championships from 1983 to 1993. Thorpe is notable for being a three-time FIM 500cc motocross world champion.David Thorpe career profile __TOC__ Motocross career Thorpe's early career saw him excel in both motocross and football, and at one stage he was even offered a contract with professional side Queen's Park Rangers, before opting to concentrate on motocross. After a successful early career for the UK Kawasaki team, Thorpe switched to the Honda factory racing team in 1983. He emerged as a regular Grand Prix winner in 1984, and took his first world title in 1985. In this year's Motocross des Nations at Gaildorf in Germany he also took the overall individual win beating American riders Jeff Ward and David Bailey. He retained his world title in 1986, following a season long battle with Honda team-mate Andr√© Malherbe. A series of injuries prevented Thorpe from making a title challenge in 1987 and 1988, where he finished fifth and third respectively in the 500cc FIM World Championship. However, Thorpe won his third title in 1989, following a thrilling season-long battle with Eric Geboers. 1990 saw him move teams to the factory Kawasaki team, however the Kawasaki machine was inferior to the factory Honda, and Thorpe struggled to compete. In 1990 and 1991 he finished fifth and seventh respectively in the 500cc World Championship. Thorpe left Kawasaki in 1991, and moved back to Honda, riding for the Italian 'Cinti Honda' team. He was unable to capture his old form, and retired from professional motocross competition in 1993 at the age of 31. Thorpe remains the last British rider to have won the premier division of the motocross world championships.  Post- Motocross career  After his competitive career, Thorpe served as manager of the British Motocross des Nations team, which included the upset victory by the 1994 British team of Rob Herring, Paul Malin and Kurt Nicoll. The victory marked the first time a British team had won the event since 1967 and, broke a 13-year American winning streak at the Motocross des Nations. Afterwards, Thorpe concentrated on team management, running the UK based CAT Honda team during the late 1990s. The team was a success both in the UK and on the Grand Prix circuit, however Honda suddenly withdrew their support (along with several other teams) in 2001, and the team disbanded. In recent years, Thorpe has returned to motocross, although he now competes for fun, competing in his local regional championship with great success. He has also been clerk of the course of the West of England MCC's Patchquick trophy meeting. In 2007 Thorpe contested the two round, FIM Veterans Motocross World Cup in the senior class. Thorpe won the overall victory at both rounds (Namur, Belgium and Donington Park, Great Britain), giving him his fourth world title.

Brisbane FC was the first known football club of any code in Brisbane, Queensland. The club commenced playing according to what was then known as the 'Victorian rules' football (now known as Australian rules football). In 1876 the club adopted rugby rules, to fit in with two newly formed Brisbane football clubs ('Bonnet Rouge' and 'Rangers' - now both defunct), before reverting to Victorian rules football (with occasional rugby matches) in 1879. The club was to last around only 20 years, disappearing from the public record in the late 1880s, when rugby football was in the ascendancy in Brisbane and Victorian rules football was in decline. History Mid-1800s: first football games in Brisbane Metropolitan Hotel Edward Street, Brisbane ca 1864 Football has been played in Brisbane from very early times, as evidenced by this notice in The Moreton Bay Courier in 1849 (a mere 25 years after the arrival of the first white settlers in the Brisbane region, at which time the population was around 2000 people, many of whom were former convicts and poor Irish immigrants): :ANNIVERSARY. :TO the SPORTING BLADES of BRISBANE. :BEING determined that the Anniversary [now called Australia Day] shall not pass over without a little fun, in addition to the usual English Sports, the Lads of Kangaroo Point :CHALLENGE :all comers to a Game of Foot Ball ‚Äì preliminaries to be settled at the Commercial Inn, Kangaroo Point, on the evening of the 24th.Moreton Bay Courier ‚Äì 20 January 1849 Given the inchoate nature of the various types of football at that time, they may have been playing simple mob football. Alternatively, they could have been playing in accordance with the recently published Rugby school rules (1845) or the Cambridge Rules (1848), the latter being the forerunner of association football rules. The game that was to become Australian rules football was not to be codified for another 10 years. 1866: club formed The Brisbane Football Club was formed at a meeting on 22 May 1866: the Brisbane Courier reported that \\"A meeting of gentlemen favorable to the formation of a Football Club in Brisbane was held on Tuesday, at Braysher's Metropolitan Hotel [formerly in Edward Street near Mary Street] ... a committee was appointed to prepare a code of rules ... The prospects of the club must be certainly very encouraging to the promoters, as already more than twenty gentlemen have joined, and a large number of others have signified their wish to do so.\\"Brisbane Courier 25 May 1866 At a subsequent meeting on 31 May \\"About 20 members were present; and the first business transacted was the election of twelve new members ... The annual subscription was fixed at 5s ... The uniform chosen was a scarlet shirt, with a distinguishing color for the captain ... A resolution was passed authorising the printing of the rules, as well as the laws of football passed at a meeting of delegates of clubs held in Melbourne on the 8th ult., which latter, it was decided, should be the laws recognised by the Brisbane Club.\\"Brisbane Courier 2 June 1866 It is not recorded why the club chose to adopt the contemporary Melbourne, rather than the Sydney, version of football (the latter being based on Rugby School rules ‚Äì rugby football was not formally codified until 1871). It may have been simply the influence of the club chairman, David Watterston who, whilst born in Scotland, came to Victoria with his parents in 1853, where he was schooled before moving to Ipswich in 1860 then Brisbane in 1865, to work as a journalist with the Brisbane Courier. It may be significant that Watterston's adolescent years spent in Melbourne coincided with the period when the Melbourne game was being codified. First games The club had its first game on Saturday 9 June 1866, as reported in the Brisbane Courier a week later: :About thirty members of the Brisbane Foot-ball Club mustered in the Queen's Park [now part of the City Botanic Gardens ‚Äì see image below] on Saturday afternoon, and played a scratch match. This was the first general turn out of the new club.Brisbane Courier 16 June 1866 The club also played matches on the 'cricket ground', located in the area then known as 'Green Hills' (beside Countess Street Petrie Terrace opposite the Victoria Barracks ‚Äì now occupied by the Northern Busway), where cricket matches were also played since at least the early 1860s. The Brisbane Courier reported in July 1866: :THE members of the Brisbane Football Club had a turn out on Saturday afternoon, and played several games. The place of meeting was the cricket ground. Though the muster was not large, the play was conducted in a spirited manner; and there were many good struggles before a goal was kicked. The ground was slippery in many places, and, as a matter of course, several \\"spills\\" occurred. There will be a practice at the Queen's Park this afternoon, the cricket ground being rather too far from the centre of the city.Brisbane Courier 2 July 1866 The club initially played intra-club matches, with teams selected arbitrarily. A newspaper report listed the players for a 'Civil Service' team (Messrs. Boyce, French, J. Bourne, Scarr, Perse, Hill, T. B. Watterston, Mills, Coley, Stewart, Bunton, Gill, Burrowes, Ryder, King, Pugh, Darvall, Costello, Pounden, Somerset, Bourne, Kellett, and Miles) to play the 'All Comers' team (Messrs. Munce, Cowlishaw, Garbut, Horsley, Sheridan, Board, Faunce, Highfield, Watterston, Sheehan, Hart, Tregurtha, Zillman, G. Smith, E. Webb, H. Webb, Fowles, Kelly, Macquarie, Cotham, Millar, Miskin, and Everest).Brisbane Courier 21 July 1866 The Brisbane Courier further reported in late 1866: \\"ON the football ground [Queen's Park], on Saturday afternoon, there was no match; but two sides were chosen, and a very lively game was played ...Five goals were kicked ... The football season will end in a few weeks and the committee of the club contemplate getting up some athletic sports as an appropriate finale.\\"Toowoomba, Brisbane Courier, 13 August 1866 By early 1868, it appears the club was struggling somewhat ‚Äì at its second annual meeting, Chairman Watterston reported that \\"Your committee ... though not able, in speaking of the operations of the past season, to refer to them as a perfect success ... can yet congratulate the members upon the satisfactory manner in which the game was carried on during the greater part of the season ... The number of paying members on the list at the beginning of last season was 68, and 15 new members joined the club in 1867. The total number, however, was reduced by 31 who resigned or left the city, and by 7 who were struck off in consequence of their subscriptions being unpaid. The total number of paid members to begin the present season with is 45.\\" It was also noted that \\"Your committee have still to regret the absence of a rival club ... Perhaps, considering the number of names on the books last year, the formation of a second club would rather retard than advance the game in Brisbane just now.\\" The Queenslander 30 May 1868 However, it appears the 1868 season was more successful ‚Äì at the annual general meeting held at Lenneberg's Caf√©, Queen Street, on 28 May 1869, chairman Watterston reported \\"Your committee ... feel that they have cause to congratulate the members on the continued interest manifested in the game during the past season, as will be seen from the large attendance at all the practices ... Three first-class matches have, however, been played ‚Äì two with the Police ... and the other by the club, and one with the 50th Regiment (Queen's Own), in which the club proved victorious.\\" The Queenslander 5 June 1869 The club competed against four ad hoc teams in the Brisbane area between 1868 and 1869, including Volunteer Artillery, the newly formed Brisbane Grammar School (then located on land which is now the Roma Street railway station) a Civil Service team and a police team, playing eight games in its inaugural 'inter-club' season. Brisbane Courier 11 July 1868 1870s: Opposition clubs formed Brisbane team ca 1870 playing London Association (soccer) rules By 1870, the Ipswich Football Club had formed and became the only other organised club in the region and hence the Brisbane club's only competition. The Queenslander 28 May 1870 Brisbane won the first three games of that season. It also appears that the club played at least one game of what was then referred to as \\"London Association rules\\" (now 'soccer'): The Queenslander of 14 August 1875 reported that on Saturday 7 August 1875, Brisbane FC played a game against the inmates and warders of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum: \\"‚Ä¶ play commenced at half-past 2 ... One rule provided that the ball should not be handled nor carried.\\" Moreover, the Victorian publication The Footballer reported in 1875 in its section on \\"Football in Queensland\\" that the ‚Äúmatch was played without handling the ball under any circumstances whatever (Association rules).\\" This is the earliest known game of 'soccer' played in the Brisbane region (and possibly in Australia). Brisbane FC ca 1879. In this year the club reverted from rugby union rules to Australian rules In 1876, two new Brisbane clubs (Rangers FC and Bonnet Rouge FC) were formed. The Brisbane Courier of 10 May 1876 reported: \\"At a meeting of the newly-formed football club at Petrie-terrace, held yesterday evening, it was decided to call the club the \\"Bonnet Rouge Football Club;\\" the uniform to be a red cap, of any shape whatever. The rugby union rules were finally adopted, as it was understood that these had been decided upon by other Brisbane clubs.\\" Brisbane Courier ‚Äì 10 May 1876 These three clubs commenced playing according to rugby union rules, but modified by local customary rules.Rugby in the Colony of Queensland (website) Unfortunately, the Bonnet Rouge and Rangers clubs disappear from the public record after the 1877 season. However, the Excelsior club was formed in 1877 and the Wallaroos in 1880, with both clubs apparently playing according to 'Victorian rules'. Brisbane Courier 5 May 1883 In 1879 the Brisbane Courier reported that the Brisbane FC had reverted to what had become known as the 'Victorian rules', \\"in place of the Rugby Union Rules played by the club during the last three seasons\\". 1880: Queensland Football Association In 1880, the club became a foundation member of the Queensland Football Association (QFA), along with Wallaroo, Excelsiors and Athenians (Ipswich). The new association decided to recognise and play both Victorian and rugby rules. However, in 1882, a Brisbane FC representative (Pring Roberts) arranged a rugby match against the Sydney Wallaroos Rugby Club, after the NSWRU (rugby union) offered to pay all costs associated with the match. Brisbane advocates of the Victorian rules game reacted angrily and declared that no QFA player would be permitted to play under rugby rules (which subsequently led to the formation of the Northern Rugby Union (now the Queensland Rugby Union) in 1884). Queen's Park in the 1880s ‚Äì playing field at far end At the Brisbane club's annual general meeting in 1882, the club secretary, Thomas Welsby, reminded members that, according to their constitution, the club should only play Victorian rules and urged them to decide whether to adhere to this rule or introduce the rugby rules. The club ultimately decided to follow the Australian game. Whilst a newspaper report in late 1886 describes Brisbane FC as \\"the premier club\\", Brisbane Courier 7 August 1886 the AFL Queensland official history asserts that the club folded that year.Brisbane Football Club 1866-1886 on AFLQ website However, the last known reference to the club is in the Brisbane Courier of 15 March 1887, where it was reported it competed in the \\"Combined Football Sports\\" against Rovers, Excelsiors, Fireflies, Wallaroos, South Brisbanes, Wanderers, Ipswich, Sandgate and Wasps Brisbane Courier 15 March 1887 (Fireflies and Wanderers clubs were foundation members of the Northern Rugby Union in 1884). Curiously, it appears that none of the several soccer clubs in the region was invited (unless 'Rovers' refers to the Bundamba Rovers). It is not recorded, but the demise of the club may have been the result the rapidly increasing popularity of rugby, with some Brisbane FC players possibly electing to join the newly formed rugby clubs, Fireflies and Wanderers (followed by the creation of four more rugby clubs by 1885‚Äì86). As rugby historian Sean Fagan noted: :The defining moment in the code battle came with the 1886 Queensland [rugby] side, who defeated NSW for the first time in Sydney. ‚ÄúThe success of this team undoubtedly won the day for rugby game in Queensland. The Victorian game supporters were struggling hard to uphold the premier position they had gained but after the brilliant performance of the 1886 team, who lost only one match through their tour, the rugby game became very popular and the next season several new clubs were formed and the Victorian game began to wane‚Äù (QRU Annual, 1902). Fagan further noted: :As the decade [1880s] came to a close, The Queensland Figaro summed up the state of play in the colony as ‚ÄúRugby, an unbounded success; Melbourne rules very sick indeed, in fact on their last legs; British Association Rules [soccer], also in a sickly state but if anything showing more life than the Victorian game.‚Äù Later Brisbane Australian football clubs Since this time, several Australian Football clubs have borne the Brisbane name, including \\"Brisbanes\\" in the 1920s, the Brisbane Bears in the 1980s and 1990s and more recently, the Brisbane Lions. However, these clubs are not connected with the original Brisbane Football Club.

These individuals are referred to as positive deviants.Tuhus-Dubrow, R. The Power of Positive Deviants: A promising new tactic for changing communities from the inside. Boston Globe.

Protecting Children from Exploitation and Trafficking Using the Positive Deviance Approach in Uganda and Indonesia. Save the Children Federation, Inc., 2010. The concept first appeared in nutrition research in the 1970s. Researchers observed that despite the poverty in a community, some poor families had well nourished children. Some suggested using information gathered from these outliers to plan nutrition programs.Wishik SM, Van der Vynckt S. The use of nutritional \\"positive deviants\\" to identify approaches for modification of dietary practices.

Positive Deviance in Child Nutrition: with Emphasis on Psychosocial and Behavioral Aspects and Implications for Development. The United Nations University, 1990. Print. Principles Positive deviance is a strength-based approach which is applied to problems requiring behavior and social change. It is based on the following principles:Pascale, Sternin, & Sternin. (2010) The Power of Positive Deviance: How Unlikely Innovators Solve the World's Toughest Problems. Harvard Business Press. Print. * Communities already have the solutions. They are the best experts to solve their problems. * Communities self-organize and have the human resources and social assets to solve an agreed-upon problem. * Collective intelligence. Intelligence and know-how is not concentrated in the leadership of a community alone or in external experts but is distributed throughout the community. Thus the aim of the PD process is to draw out the collective intelligence to apply it to a specific problem requiring behavior or social change. * Sustainability as the cornerstone of the approach. The PD approach enables the community or organization to seek and discover sustainable solutions to a given problem because the demonstrably successful uncommon behaviors are already practiced in that community within the constraints and challenges of the current situation. * It is easier to change behavior by practicing it rather than knowing about it. \\"It is easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than think your way into a new way of acting\\". Original application The PD approach was first operationalized and applied in programming in the field by Jerry and Monique Sternin through their work with Save the Children in Vietnam in the 1990s (Tuhus-Dubrow, Sternin, Sternin & Pascale).Khatoon, Ajeeba, Ambreen, Amama, Shaifique, Mohammad, Sternin, Monique. The Positive Deviance Approach to Improve Household Practice for Better Newborn and Maternal Health Outcomes in Haripur, Pakistan. Operations Manual Saving Newborn Lives. July 12, 2002. At the start of the pilot 64% of children weighed in the pilot villages were malnourished. Through a PD inquiry, the villagers found poor peers in the community that through their uncommon but successful strategies, had well-nourished children. These families collected foods typically considered inappropriate for children (sweet potato greens, shrimp, and crabs), washed their children's hands before meals, and actively fed them three to four times a day instead of the typical two meals a day provided to children.Marsh DR, Pachon H, Schroeder DG, et al. Design of a prospective, randomized evaluation of an integrated nutrition program in rural Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):34-44.Mackintosh UAT, Marsh DR, Schroeder DG. Sustained positive deviant child care practices and their effects on child growth in Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):16-25. Without knowing it, PDs had incorporated foods already found in their community that provided important nutrients: protein, iron, and calcium. A nutrition program based on these insights was created. Instead of simply telling participants what to do differently, they designed the program to help them act their way into a new way of thinking. To attend a feeding session, parents were required to bring one of the newly identified foods. They brought their children and while sharing nutritious meals, learned to cook the new foods. At the end of the two year pilot, malnutrition fell by 85%. Results were sustained, and transferred to the younger siblings of participants. This approach to programming was different in important ways. Based on a community's own assets, the positive deviance approach operates within the specific cultural context of a given community (village, business, schools, ministry, department, hospital) and is therefore always appropriate. It provides to community members the \\"social proof\\" that an uncommon behavior can be adopted by all because it is already practiced by a few within the community. The solutions come from the community, therefore avoid the \\"immune response\\" that can occur when outside experts enter a community with best practices that are often unsuccessful in promoting sustained change. (Sternin) Since it was first applied in Vietnam, PD has been used to inform nutrition programs in over 40 countries by USAID, World Vision, Mercy Corps, Save the Children, CARE, Plan International, Indonesian Ministry of Health, Peace Corps, Food for the Hungry, among others. Steps A positive deviance approach may follow a series of steps. An invitation to change A PD inquiry begins with an invitation from a community that wishes to address an important problem they face. This is an important first step of community ownership of a process that they will lead. Defining the problem This process occurs with the community at the center of defining the problem for themselves. This will often lead to a problem definition that differs from the outside \\"expert\\" opinion of the situation. A quantitative baseline is established by the community. This baseline provides an opportunity for the community to reflect on the problem given the evidence at hand, and also measure the progress toward their goals. This is also the beginning of the process to identify stakeholder and decision-makers regarding the issue at hand. Additional stakeholders and decision-makers will be pulled in throughout the process as they are identified. Determining the presence of PD individuals or groups Through the use of data and observation, the community establishes that there are Positive Deviants in their midst. Discovering uncommon practices or behaviors This is the Positive Deviance Inquiry. The community, having identified positive deviants, sets out to find the behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that allow the PD to be successful. The focus is on the successful strategies of the PD, not on making a hero of the person using the strategy. This self-discovery of people/groups just like them who have found successful solutions provide \\"social proof\\" that this problem can be overcome now, without outside resources. Program design Now that the community has identified successful strategies, they decide what strategies they would like to adopt, and design activities to help others access and practice these uncommon and other beneficial. Program design is not focused on spreading \\"best practices\\" but helping community members \\"act their way into a new way of thinking\\" through hands-on activities. Monitoring and evaluation PD-informed projects are monitored their programs and evaluated through a participatory process. As the monitoring will be decided on and performed by the community, the tools they create will be appropriate to the setting. This can allow even illiterate community members to participate through pictorial monitoring forms or other appropriate tools. Evaluation allows the community to see the progress they are making towards their goals and reinforces the changes they are making in behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs. Scaling up The scaling up of a PD project may happen through many mechanisms: the \\"ripple effect\\" of other communities observing the success and engaging in a PD project of their own, through the coordination of NGOs, or organizational development consultants. However the project is scaled up, the process of community discovery of PDs in their midst remains vital to the acceptance of new behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge. Applications  Preventing hospital-acquired infections  The PD approach has been applied in hospitals in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and England to stop the spread of hospital acquired infections such as c-diff and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluated pilot programs in the U.S. and found units using the approach decreased their infections by 30-73%.Awad S., Palacio C., Subramanian A., et al. Implementation of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevention bundle results in decreased MRSA surgical site infections. The American Journal of Surgery. 2009; 198: 607-610. Additionally, it has been used in health care setting increase the incidence of hand washing, and improving care for patients immediately after a heart attack.Bradly E, Curry L, Ramanadhan R, et al. Research in action: using positive deviance to improve quality of health care. Implementation Science. May 2009: 4:25.  Primary care (Bright Spotting)  Termed \\"Bright Spotting\\", instead of positive deviance, the primary care pilot initiative first took place in rural New Hampshire and is still ongoing. The outpatient clinic identified a complex patient population, from the clinics perspective, studied the risk factors of that population, then identified measures that would signify that a patient has become healthy and sustained health. Once these measures were identified, using both data and the practices knowledge of patient's, \\"Bright Spots\\" were identified as those that meet both criteria of high risk and achieved health Finding positive deviant patients through predictive analytics has also be suggested as a possible tool in discovery. Once these patients were identified the care team performed qualitative research to discover their patterns of behavior. The results were then shown to the bright spots and their families who then designed a peer learning experience with the results in mind. The community meetings were then facilitated using both positive deviance facilitation techniques as well as applying the \\"Citizen Health Care Model\\" which is very similar to positive deviance approaches.

Efforts have already shown a reduction in the practice.Masterson J, Swanson J. Female Genital Cutting: Breaking the Silence, Enabling Change. International Center for Research on Women (ICWR) and the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA). Washington, DC. 2000. In Uganda, a project with the Oak Foundation and Save the Children helped girls who were child soldiers with the Lords Resistance Army in Sudan reintegrate into their communities.  In education  PD projects in New Jersey, California, Argentina, Ethiopia, and Burkina Faso have addressed drop out rates and keeping girls in school.  Private sector  Proponents of PD within management science argue that in any population, even in such seemingly mundane groups as service personnel in a fast food environment, the positive deviants have attitudes, cognitive processes and behavioral patterns that lead to significantly improved performance in key metrics such as speed-of-service and profitability. Studies claim that widespread adoption of the positive deviant approaches consistently leads to significant performance improvement.

Overview Road sign in Arlington In 2009, the county maintains of roads.County website , the total mileage of (primary) state highways in Arlington County was 39.66 (59 km). Arlington County is one of only two counties in Virginia which maintain its own roads (with the exception of primary state highways, including U.S. Highways and Interstates), the other being Henrico County outside the State Capital of Richmond. Because of this special status, there are no secondary state roads and, therefore, most roads are unnumbered. This status originated due to the existence of county highway departments in Arlington prior to the creation of the state transportation agency which is now the VDOT in 1927, and the assumption of local roads control by that agency in 1932. The control of the roads system is considered a powerful advantage for community urban planners, who can require developers to contribute to funding needed for road needs serving their projects. Although the streets of Arlington County are not laid out on a grid plan, its local streets follow the Arlington County, Virginia, street-naming system: a system of sequential numbered or alphabetic patterns that are both rational and provide address numbering information. Interstate highways Interstate 66 The configuration of Interstate 66 through Arlington (first proposed in 1956) has long been controversial. The Arlington Coalition on Transportation (ACT) filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in 1971 opposing the portion of the project through Arlington. The group objected to that urban segment due to concerns over air quality, noise and community cohesion changes. In 1972 the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of ACT, technically blocking any construction. Arlington Coalition on Transportation v. Volpe, 458 F.2d 1323 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1000 (1972). The impasse was eventually broken when the parties agreed on experts to conduct air quality and noise studies for the Virginia Department of Transportation, then known as the Virginia Department of Highways; then, Secretary of Transportation Coleman personally intervened in 1976 with negotiations to reach a compromise by reducing the highway capacity, making I-66 HOV during parts of the day, and including a subway route in I-66's median.C. Michael Hogan and Harry Seidman, Air Quality and Acoustics Analysis of Proposed I-66 through Arlington, Virginia, ESL Inc. Technical Document T1026, Sunnyvale, Calif. (1971) The eastbound traffic lanes of I-66 in Arlington are presently restricted to high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) traffic and motorcycles during morning peak hours, while the westbound lanes are restricted to this traffic during the evening peak hours. Due to very frequent traffics jams in the four lane section of I-66, many people in the region have advocated widening I-66, although the County Board and many local residents continue to oppose it. Interstate 395 Begun during World War II to serve the Pentagon, Interstate 395 (I-395) (named the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway) bisects Arlington as it travels southwest/northeast between the 14th Street Bridge and Alexandria. Until it closed in 1968, the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad's freight trains regularly backed up rush hour traffic and collided with automobiles and trucks as they crossed the highway at grade on tracks guarded by flashing signal lights and ringing bells, but no crossing gates. At the time, this was the only at-grade intersection of a railroad and a limited-access federal highway. Heavily congested during peak hours, the freeway now contains two central lanes that operate as high- occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes during rush hours while separated by Jersey barriers from the road's regular traffic lanes. Although express Metrobuses often travel in the HOV lanes, Metrorail does not travel along its corridor. Proposed interstates Interstate 595 Interstate 595 was a proposed upgrade to U.S. 1 (Jefferson Davis Highway) in Crystal City. Interstate 266 Interstate 266 was a proposed loop route from Interstate 66 between Arlington and Washington, D.C., that would have crossed the Potomac River on a new bridge. Arterial routes The street-naming system does not apply to the main arteries (none of which are called \\"streets\\"). The north-south arteries from east to west include US 1 (Jefferson Davis Highway), Walter Reed Drive, Glebe Road, George Mason Drive and Carlin Springs Road. The east-west arteries from north to south include Williamsburg Boulevard, Yorktown Boulevard, Lee Highway (U.S. Route 29), Wilson Boulevard, U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard), State Route 244 (Columbia Pike) and Four Mile Run Drive. Another main artery, Washington Boulevard, previously a cow path, runs both east-west and north-south. Through most of Arlington it runs east-west between Wilson Boulevard and Lee Highway. When it reaches the east side of the county, it turns south to avoid Fort Myer, crosses US 50 and becomes State Route 27, a freeway, before crossing SR 244 and intersecting with I-395. It then turns back northeast and runs past the Pentagon to end at the D.C. boundary just before the George Washington Memorial Parkway. Parkways Arlington has two limited-access scenic parkways maintained by the U.S. National Park Service which also serve as major commuter routes. George Washington Memorial Parkway The George Washington Memorial Parkway runs northwest-southeast along Arlington County's entire Potomac River boundary with Washington, D.C., except for a small section traversing Columbia Island which is part of the District of Columbia. Spout Run Parkway The Spout Run Parkway is a spur from the George Washington Parkway providing access to Cherrydale, Lee Highway (U.S. Highway 29), and, indirectly, Interstate 66. Bridges Arlington County is connected to Washington, D.C. by several road bridges across the Potomac River. From upstream to the southeast, they are the Chain Bridge (State Route 123), the Francis Scott Key Bridge (U.S. Route 29), the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge (Interstate 66/U.S. Route 50), the Arlington Memorial Bridge, and the 14th Street Bridge complex (Interstate 395/U.S. Route 1).

The Return of Tarzan is a novel by U.S.American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the second in his series of twenty-four books about the title character Tarzan. It was first published in the pulp magazine New Story Magazine in the issues for June through December 1913; the first book edition was published in 1915 by A. C. McClurg. Plot summary The novel picks up soon after where Tarzan of the Apes left off. The ape man, feeling rootless in the wake of his noble sacrifice of his prospects of wedding Jane Porter, leaves USA for Europe to visit his friend Paul d'Arnot. On the ship he becomes embroiled in the affairs of Countess Olga de Coude, her husband, Count Raoul de Coude, and two shady characters attempting to prey on them, Nikolas Rokoff and his henchman Alexis Paulvitch. Rokoff, it turns out, is also the countess's brother. Tarzan thwarts the villains' scheme, making them his deadly enemies. Later, in France, Rokoff tries time and again to eliminate the ape man, finally engineering a duel between him and the count by making it appear that he is the countess's lover. Tarzan deliberately refuses to defend himself in the duel, even offering the count his own weapon after the latter fails to kill him with his own, a grand gesture that convinces his antagonist of his innocence. In return, Count Raoul finds him a job as a special agent in the French ministry of war. Tarzan is assigned to service in Algeria. A sequence of adventures among the local Arabs ensues, including another brush with Rokoff. Afterward Tarzan sails for Cape Town and strikes up a shipboard acquaintance with Hazel Strong, a friend of Jane's. But Rokoff and Paulovitch are also aboard, and manage to ambush him and throw him overboard. Miraculously, Tarzan manages to swim to shore, and finds himself in the coastal jungle where he was brought up by the apes. He soon rescues and befriends a native warrior, Busuli of the Waziri, and is adopted into the Waziri tribe. After defeating a raid on their village by ivory raiders, Tarzan becomes their chief. The Waziri know of a lost city deep in the jungle, from which they have obtained their golden ornaments. Tarzan has them take him there, but is captured by its inhabitants, a race of ape-like men, and is condemned to be sacrificed to their sun god. To Tarzan's surprise, the priestess to perform the sacrifice is a beautiful woman who speaks the ape language he learned as a child. She tells him she is La, high priestess of the lost city of Opar. When the sacrificial ceremony is fortuitously interrupted, she hides Tarzan and promises to lead him to freedom. But the ape man escapes on his own, locates a treasure chamber, and manages to rejoin the Waziri. Meanwhile, Hazel Strong has reached Cape Town where she meets Jane and her father, Professor Porter, together with Jane's fianc√©, Tarzan's cousin William Cecil Clayton. They are all invited on a cruise up the west coast of Africa aboard the Lady Alice, the yacht of another friend, Lord Tennington. Rokoff, now using the alias of M. Thuran, ingratiates himself with the party and is also invited along. The Lady Alice breaks down and sinks, forcing the passengers and crew into the lifeboats. The one containing Jane, Clayton and \\"Thuran\\" is separated from the others and suffers terrible privations. Coincidentally, the boat finally makes shore in the same general area that Tarzan did. The three construct a rude shelter and eke out an existence of near starvation for some weeks until Jane and William Clayton are surprised in the forest by a lion. Clayton loses Jane's respect by cowering in fear before the beast instead of defending her, but they are not attacked and discover the lion dead, speared by an unknown hand. Their hidden savior is in fact Tarzan, who does not reveal himself due to anger at seeing Jane still with Clayton. Tarzan renounces any dealings with other humans, abandons the Waziri, and rejoins his original ape clan. Jane breaks off her engagement to William. Later Jane is kidnapped and taken to Opar by a party of the Oparian ape-men who were pursuing their escaped sacrifice, Tarzan. The ape man learns of her capture and tracks them, managing to save her from being sacrificed by La. La is crushed by Tarzan's spurning of her for Jane. After searching for Jane, Clayton is incapacitated with a fever and Thuran abandons him to die. Thuran discovers the other survivors from the Lady Alice who came to shore only a few miles away. He tells them that he is the sole survivor of his lifeboat. Tarzan and Jane return to Jane's shelter, along the way encountering Busuli and a group of Waziri who have been searching for their king since he disappeared. At the shelter, Clayton is at the point of death. Before he dies, he reveals to Tarzan and Jane that he knows Tarzan is the true Lord Greystoke. Tarzan and Jane make their way up the coast to the former's boyhood cabin so they can bury Clayton alongside his aunt and uncle. Here they encounter the remainder of the castaways of the Lady Alice, who have been recovered by D'Arnot in a French navy vessel. Tarzan exposes Thuran as Rokoff and the French arrest him. Tarzan weds Jane and Tennington weds Hazel in a double ceremony performed by Professor Porter, who had been ordained a minister in his youth. Then they all set sail for civilization, taking along the treasure Tarzan had found in Opar. The Waziri receive gifts from the French and reluctantly accept the departure of their king. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations Burroughs' novel was the basis of two movies, the silent films The Revenge of Tarzan (1920) and The Adventures of Tarzan (1921), based on the first and second parts of the book, respectively. The first film starred Gene Pollar as the ape man, and the second Elmo Lincoln, the original movie Tarzan. Nikolas Rokoff and Alexis appears in The Legend Of Tarzan, in the episode ‚ÄúTarzan and the Buried Treasure‚Äù. Comic adaptations The book has been adapted into comic form on a number of occasions, both in the original Tarzan comic strip and comic books. Notable adaptations include those of Gold Key Comics in Tarzan no. 156, dated November 1966 (script by Gaylord DuBois, art by Russ Manning), of DC Comics in Tarzan nos. 219-223, dated April‚ÄìSeptember 1973, and of Dynamite Entertainment in Lord of the Jungle nos. 9-14, dated 2012-2013. Media references Science fiction writer and Burroughs enthusiast Philip Jos√© Farmer later took up the city of Opar, as appearing in this and later Tarzan novels, and wrote the novels Hadon of Ancient Opar (1974) and Flight to Opar (1976), depicting the city in its full glory many thousands of years in the past.

In mathematics, transformations equivalent to what was later known as Lorentz transformations in various dimensions were discussed in the 19th century in relation to the theory of quadratic forms, hyperbolic geometry, M√∂bius geometry, and sphere geometry, which is connected to the fact that the group of motions in hyperbolic space, the M√∂bius group or projective special linear group, and the Laguerre group are isomorphic to the Lorentz group. In physics, Lorentz transformations became known at the beginning of the 20th century, when it was discovered that they exhibit the symmetry of Maxwell's equations. Subsequently, they became fundamental to all of physics, because they formed the basis of special relativity in which they exhibit the symmetry of Minkowski spacetime, making the speed of light invariant between different inertial frames. They relate the spacetime coordinates of two arbitrary inertial frames of reference with constant relative speed v. In one frame, the position of an event is given by x,y,z and time t, while in the other frame the same event has coordinates x‚Ä≤,y‚Ä≤,z‚Ä≤ and t‚Ä≤.  Most general Lorentz transformations  The general quadratic form q(x) with coefficients of a symmetric matrix A, the associated bilinear form b(x,y), and the linear transformations of q(x) and b(x,y) into q(x‚Ä≤) and b(x‚Ä≤,y‚Ä≤) using the transformation matrix g, can be written asB√¥cher (1907), chapter X \\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\end{align} & =q'=\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm{\\\\prime T}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}'\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}'\\\\\\\\\\\\ b=\\\\sum_{0}^{n}A_{ij}x_{i}y_{j}=\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{y} & =b'=\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm{\\\\prime T}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}'\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{y}' \\\\end{align} \\\\quad\\\\left(A_{ij}=A_{ji}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x_{i}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}x_{j}=\\\\mathbf{g}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{i} & =\\\\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}^{(-1)}x_{j}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\mathbf{g}^{-1}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}' \\\\end{align} \\\\right|\\\\mathbf{g}^\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{g}=\\\\mathbf{A}' \\\\end{matrix}|}} in which case n=1 is the binary quadratic form, n=2 is the ternary quadratic form, n=3 is the quaternary quadratic form. The general Lorentz transformation follows from () by setting A=A‚Ä≤=diag(-1,1,...,1) and det g=¬±1. It forms an indefinite orthogonal group called the Lorentz group O(1,n), while the case det g=+1 forms the restricted Lorentz group SO(1,n). The quadratic form q(x) becomes the Lorentz interval in terms of an indefinite quadratic form of Minkowski space (being a special case of pseudo-Euclidean space), and the associated bilinear form b(x) becomes the Minkowski inner product:Ratcliffe (1994), 3.1 and Theorem 3.1.4 and Exercise 3.1Naimark (1964), 2 in four dimensions \\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A} & =\\\\mathbf{g}^{-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{g}^\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{g} & =\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{g}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{g}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & =\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\begin{align}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}g_{ij}g_{ik}-g_{0j}g_{0k} & =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{align}-1\\\\quad & (j=k=0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\quad & (j=k>0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\quad & (j e k) \\\\end{align} \\\\right.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}g_{ij}g_{kj}-g_{i0}g_{k0} & =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{align}-1\\\\quad & (i=k=0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\quad & (i=k>0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\quad & (i e k) \\\\end{align} \\\\right. \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\end{matrix}|}} If x_{i},\\\\ x_{i}^{\\\\prime} in () are interpreted as homogeneous coordinates, then the corresponding inhomogenous coordinates u_{s},\\\\ u_{s}^{\\\\prime} follow by :\\\\left[\\\\frac{x_{0}}{x_{0}},\\\\ \\\\frac{x_{s}}{x_{0}}\\\\right]=\\\\left[1,\\\\ u_{s}\\\\right],\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}}{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}},\\\\ \\\\frac{x_{s}^{\\\\prime}}{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right]=\\\\left[1,\\\\ u_{s}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right],\\\\ (s=1,2\\\\dots n) so that the Lorentz transformation becomes a homography leaving invariant the equation of the unit sphere, which John Lighton Synge called \\"the most general formula for the composition of velocities\\" in terms of special relativity (the transformation matrix g stays the same as in ()):Synge (1955), p. 129 for n=3 {\\\\left(g_{00}+g_{01}u_{1}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\dots+g_{0n}u_{n}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)^{2}}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{-1+u_{1}^{2}+\\\\cdots+u_{n}^{2}}{\\\\left(g_{00}-g_{10}u_{1}-\\\\dots- g_{n0}u_{n}\\\\right)^{2}}} & =-1+u_{1}^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\cdots+u_{n}^{\\\\prime2} \\\\end{align} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline -x_{0}^{2}+\\\\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=-x_{0}^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\dots+x_{n}^{\\\\prime2}=0 & \\\\rightarrow & -1+u_{1}^{2}+\\\\cdots+u_{n}^{2}=-1+u_{1}^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\cdots+u_{n}^{\\\\prime2}=0 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\begin{align}u_{s}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{g_{s0}+g_{s1}u_{1}+\\\\dots+g_{sn}u_{n}}{g_{00}+g_{01}u_{1}+\\\\dots+g_{0n}u_{n}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{s} & =\\\\frac{-g_{0s}+g_{1s}u_{1}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\dots+g_{ns}u_{n}^{\\\\prime}}{g_{00}-g_{10}u_{1}^{\\\\prime}-\\\\dots- g_{n0}u_{n}^{\\\\prime}} \\\\end{align} \\\\left|\\\\begin{align}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}g_{ij}g_{ik}-g_{0j}g_{0k} & =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{align}-1\\\\quad & (j=k=0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\quad & (j=k>0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\quad & (j e k) \\\\end{align} \\\\right.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}g_{ij}g_{kj}-g_{i0}g_{k0} & =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{align}-1\\\\quad & (i=k=0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\quad & (i=k>0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\quad & (i e k) \\\\end{align} \\\\right. \\\\end{align} \\\\right. \\\\end{matrix}|}}  Lorentz transformation via imaginary orthogonal transformation  By using the imaginary quantities [\\\\mathfrak{x}_{0},\\\\ \\\\mathfrak{x}'_{0}]=\\\\left[ix_{0},\\\\ ix_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right] in x as well as [\\\\mathfrak{g}_{0s},\\\\ \\\\mathfrak{g}_{s0}]=\\\\left[ig_{0s},\\\\ ig_{s0}\\\\right] (s=1,2...n) in g, the Lorentz transformation () assumes the form of an orthogonal transformation of Euclidean space forming the orthogonal group O(n) if det g=¬±1 or the special orthogonal group SO(n) if det g=+1, the Lorentz interval becomes the Euclidean norm, and the Minkowski inner product becomes the dot product:Laue (1921), pp. 79‚Äì80 for n=3 \\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}' \\\\end{matrix}\\\\left|\\\\begin{align}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}g_{ij}g_{ik} & =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{align}1\\\\quad & (j=k)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\quad & (j e k) \\\\end{align} \\\\right.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}g_{kj} & =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{align}1\\\\quad & (i=k)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\quad & (i e k) \\\\end{align} \\\\right. \\\\end{align} \\\\right. \\\\end{matrix}|}} A well known example of this orthogonal transformation is spatial rotation in terms of trigonometric functions, which become Lorentz transformations by using an imaginary angle \\\\phi=i\\\\eta, so that trigonometric functions become equivalent to hyperbolic functions: or in exponential form using Euler's formula e^{i\\\\phi}=\\\\cos\\\\phi+i\\\\sin\\\\phi:  Lorentz transformation via hyperbolic functions  The case of a Lorentz transformation without spatial rotation is called a Lorentz boost.

Alternatively, the hyperbolic angle sum laws themselves can be interpreted as Lorentz boosts, as demonstrated by using the parameterization of the unit hyperbola: Finally, Lorentz boost () assumes a simple form by using squeeze mappings in analogy to Euler's formula in ():Rindler (1969), p. 45 In line with equation () one can use coordinates [u_{1},\\\\ u_{2},\\\\ 1]=\\\\left[\\\\tfrac{x_{1}}{x_{0}},\\\\ \\\\tfrac{x_{2}}{x_{0}},\\\\ \\\\tfrac{x_{0}}{x_{0}}\\\\right] inside the unit circle u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}=1, thus the corresponding Lorentz transformations () obtain the form: {\\\\left(\\\\cosh\\\\eta+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sinh\\\\eta\\\\right)^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{-1+u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}}{\\\\left(\\\\cosh\\\\eta-u_{1}\\\\sinh\\\\eta\\\\right)^{2}} & =-1+u_{1}^{\\\\prime2}+u_{2}^{\\\\prime2} \\\\end{align} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline -x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=-x_{0}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{2}^{\\\\prime2}=0 & \\\\rightarrow & -1+u_{x}^{2}+u_{y}^{2}=-1+u_{x}^{\\\\prime2}+u_{y}^{\\\\prime2}=0 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline {\\\\scriptstyle \\\\begin{align}\\\\frac{\\\\sinh\\\\eta}{\\\\cosh\\\\eta} & =\\\\tanh\\\\eta=v\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cosh\\\\eta & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta}} \\\\end{align} }\\\\left|\\\\begin{align} & (a) & & (b) & & (c)\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{1}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{-\\\\sinh\\\\eta+u_{1}\\\\cosh\\\\eta}{\\\\cosh\\\\eta-u_{1}\\\\sinh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{1}-\\\\tanh\\\\eta}{1-u_{1}\\\\tanh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{1}-v}{1-u_{1}v}\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{2}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{u_{2}}{\\\\cosh\\\\eta-u_{1}\\\\sinh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{2}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta}}{1-u_{1}\\\\tanh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{2}\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}{1-u_{1}v}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{1} & =\\\\frac{\\\\sinh\\\\eta+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cosh\\\\eta}{\\\\cosh\\\\eta+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sinh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{1}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\tanh\\\\eta}{1+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\tanh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{1}^{\\\\prime}+v}{1+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}v}\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{2} & =\\\\frac{u_{2}^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\cosh\\\\eta+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sinh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{2}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta}}{1+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\tanh\\\\eta} & & =\\\\frac{u_{2}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}{1+u_{1}^{\\\\prime}v} \\\\end{align} \\\\right. \\\\end{matrix}|}} By using the scalar product of \\\\left[u_{1},u_{2}\\\\right], the resulting Lorentz transformation can be seen as equivalent to the hyperbolic law of cosines:Pauli (1921), p. 561Variƒáak (1912), p. 108Barrett (2006), chapter 4, section 2 }{1+vu'\\\\cos\\\\alpha'}, & u'\\\\sin\\\\alpha' & =\\\\frac{u\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}{1-vu\\\\cos\\\\alpha}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\alpha & =\\\\frac{u'\\\\sin\\\\alpha'\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}{u'\\\\cos\\\\alpha'+v}, & \\\\tan\\\\alpha' & =\\\\frac{u\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}{u\\\\cos\\\\alpha-v} \\\\end{align} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow & u=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{v^{2}+u^{\\\\prime2}+2vu'\\\\cos\\\\alpha'-\\\\left(vu'\\\\sin\\\\alpha'\\\\right){}^{2}}}{1+vu'\\\\cos\\\\alpha'},\\\\quad u'=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-v^{2}-u^{2}+2vu\\\\cos\\\\alpha+\\\\left(vu\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\right){}^{2}}}{1-vu\\\\cos\\\\alpha}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-u^{\\\\prime2}}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-u^{2}}}-\\\\frac{v}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}\\\\frac{u}{\\\\sqrt{1-u^{2}}}\\\\cos\\\\alpha & (b)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\xi}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta}}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\zeta}}-\\\\frac{\\\\tanh\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta}}\\\\frac{\\\\tanh\\\\zeta}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\zeta}}\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow & \\\\cosh\\\\xi=\\\\cosh\\\\eta\\\\cosh\\\\zeta-\\\\sinh\\\\eta\\\\sinh\\\\zeta\\\\cos\\\\alpha & (a) \\\\end{matrix}|}}  Lorentz transformation via velocity  In the theory of relativity, Lorentz transformations exhibit the symmetry of Minkowski spacetime by using a constant c as the speed of light, and a parameter v as the relative velocity between two inertial reference frames.

Minkowski (1907‚Äì1908) and Variƒáak (1910) showed the relation to imaginary and hyperbolic functions. Important contributions to the mathematical understanding of the Lorentz transformation were also made by other authors such as Herglotz (1909/10), Ignatowski (1910), Noether (1910) and Klein (1910), Borel (1913‚Äì14). Also Lorentz boosts for arbitrary directions in line with () can be given as:M√∏ller (1952/55), Chapter II, ¬ß 18 :\\\\mathbf{x}'=\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\gamma & -\\\\gamma\\\\beta n_{x} & -\\\\gamma\\\\beta n_{y} & -\\\\gamma\\\\beta n_{z}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\gamma\\\\beta n_{x} & 1+(\\\\gamma-1)n_{x}^{2} & (\\\\gamma-1)n_{x}n_{y} & (\\\\gamma-1)n_{x}n_{z}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\gamma\\\\beta n_{y} & (\\\\gamma-1)n_{y}n_{x} & 1+(\\\\gamma-1)n_{y}^{2} & (\\\\gamma-1)n_{y}n_{z}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\gamma\\\\beta n_{z} & (\\\\gamma-1)n_{z}n_{x} & (\\\\gamma-1)n_{z}n_{y} & 1+(\\\\gamma-1)n_{z}^{2} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\quad\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{n}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}}{v}\\\\right] or in vector notation {c^{2}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}' & =\\\\mathbf{r}+(\\\\gamma-1)(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n})\\\\mathbf{n}-\\\\gamma tv\\\\mathbf{n} \\\\end{align} |}} Such transformations were formulated by Herglotz (1911) and Silberstein (1911) and others.

These formulas resemble the equations of an ellipse of eccentricity v/c, eccentric anomaly Œ±' and true anomaly Œ±, first geometrically formulated by Kepler (1609) and explicitly written down by Euler (1735, 1748), Lagrange (1770) and many others in relation to planetary motions.Plummer (1910), pp. 258-259: After deriving the relativistic expressions for the aberration angles œÜ' and œÜ, Plummer remarked on p. 259: Another geometrical representation is obtained by assimilating œÜ' to the eccentric and œÜ to the true anomaly in an ellipse whose eccentricity is v/U = sin Œ≤.Robinson (1990), chapter 3-4, analyzed the relation between \\"Kepler's formula\\" and the \\"physical velocity addition formula\\" in special relativity.  Lorentz transformation via conformal, spherical wave, and Laguerre transformation  If one only requires the invariance of the light cone represented by the differential equation -dx_{0}^{2}+\\\\dots+dx_{n}^{2}=0, which is the same as asking for the most general transformation that changes spheres into spheres, the Lorentz group can be extended by adding dilations represented by the factor Œª. The result is the group Con(1,p) of spacetime conformal transformations in terms of special conformal transformations and inversions producing the relation :-dx_{0}^{2}+\\\\dots+dx_{n}^{2}=\\\\lambda\\\\left(-dx_{0}^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\dots+dx_{n}^{\\\\prime2}\\\\right). One can switch between two representations of this group by using an imaginary sphere radius coordinate x0=iR with the interval dx_{0}^{2}+\\\\dots+dx_{n}^{2} related to conformal transformations, or by using a real radius coordinate x0=R with the interval -dx_{0}^{2}+\\\\dots+dx_{n}^{2} related to spherical wave transformations in terms of contact transformations preserving circles and spheres. It turns out that Con(1,3) is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group SO(2,4), and contains the Lorentz group SO(1,3) as a subgroup by setting Œª=1. More generally, Con(q,p) is isomorphic to SO(q+1,p+1) and contains SO(q,p) as subgroup.Schottenloher (2008), section 2.2 This implies that Con(0,p) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group of arbitrary dimensions SO(1,p+1). Consequently, the conformal group in the plane Con(0,2) ‚Äì known as the group of M√∂bius transformations ‚Äì is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(1,3).Kastrup (2008), section 2.4.1Schottenloher (2008), section 2.3 This can be seen using tetracyclical coordinates satisfying the form -x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}=0. A special case of Lie's geometry of oriented spheres is the Laguerre group, transforming oriented planes and lines into each other. It's generated by the Laguerre inversion leaving invariant x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-R^{2} with R as radius, thus the Laguerre group is isomorphic to the Lorentz group.Coolidge (1916), p. 370Cartan & Fano (1915/55), sections 14‚Äì15  Lorentz transformation via Cayley‚ÄìHermite transformation  The general transformation () of any quadratic form into itself can also be given using arbitrary parameters based on the Cayley transform (I-T)‚àí1¬∑(I+T), where I is the identity matrix, T an arbitrary antisymmetric matrix, and by adding A as symmetric matrix defining the quadratic form (there is no primed A' because the coefficients are assumed to be the same on both sides):Hawkins (2013), pp. 210‚Äì214Meyer (1899), p. 329 \\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}=q'=\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm{\\\\prime T}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}'\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}=(\\\\mathbf{I}-\\\\mathbf{T}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{I}+\\\\mathbf{T}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}'\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{or}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{A}-\\\\mathbf{T})\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{A}+\\\\mathbf{T})^{-1}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}' \\\\end{matrix}|}} For instance, the choice A=diag(1,1,1) gives an orthogonal transformation which can be used to describe spatial rotations corresponding to the Euler-Rodrigues parameters [a,b,c,d] which can be interpreted as the coefficients of quaternions. Setting d=1, the equations have the form: \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=x_{0}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{2}^{\\\\prime2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{x}'=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\kappa}\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}1-a^{2}-b^{2}+c^{2} & 2(bc-a) & 2(ac+b)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2(bc+a) & 1-a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2} & 2(ab-c)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2(ac-b) & 2(ab+c) & 1+a^{2}-b^{2}-c^{2} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\kappa=1+a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\\\\right) \\\\end{matrix}|}} Also the Lorentz interval and the general Lorentz transformation in any dimension can be produced by the Cayley‚ÄìHermite formalism.Borel (1914), pp. 39‚Äì41Brill (1925)Klein (1928), ¬ß 2BLorente (2003), section 3.3 For instance, Lorentz transformation () with n=1 follows from () with: \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline -x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}=-x_{0}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{x}'=\\\\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}1+a^{2} & -2a\\\\\\\\\\\\ -2a & 1+a^{2} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\Rightarrow\\\\begin{matrix}-x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}=-x_{0}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x_{0} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{2\\\\beta_{0}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} & = & \\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}\\\\right)+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}2\\\\beta_{0}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{1} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{2\\\\beta_{0}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} & = & \\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}2\\\\beta_{0}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}\\\\right)}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{0}^{\\\\prime} & =x_{0}\\\\frac{1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}-x_{1}\\\\frac{2\\\\beta_{0}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} & = & \\\\frac{x_{0}\\\\left(1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}\\\\right)-x_{1}2\\\\beta_{0}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{1}^{\\\\prime} & =-x_{0}\\\\frac{2\\\\beta_{0}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}+x_{1}\\\\frac{1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} & = & \\\\frac{-x_{0}2\\\\beta_{0}+x_{1}\\\\left(1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}\\\\right)}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} \\\\end{align} \\\\right|{\\\\scriptstyle \\\\begin{align}\\\\frac{2\\\\beta_{0}}{1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} & =\\\\beta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} & =\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{2\\\\beta_{0}}{1-\\\\beta_{0}^{2}} & =\\\\beta\\\\gamma \\\\end{align} } \\\\end{matrix}|}} This becomes Lorentz boost ( or ) by setting \\\\tfrac{2a}{1+a^{2}}=\\\\tfrac{v}{c}, which is equivalent to the relation \\\\tfrac{2\\\\beta_{0}}{1+\\\\beta_{0}^{2}}=\\\\tfrac{v}{c} known from Loedel diagrams, thus () can be interpreted as a Lorentz boost from the viewpoint of a \\"median frame\\" in which two other inertial frames are moving with equal speed \\\\beta_0 in opposite directions.

When defined in terms of isometries of hyperblic space (hyperbolic motions), the Hermitian matrix u associated with these M√∂bius transformations produces an invariant determinant \\\\det\\\\mathbf{u}=x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{3}^{2} identical to the Lorentz interval. Therefore, these transformations were described by John Lighton Synge as being a \\"factory for the mass production of Lorentz transformations\\". It also turns out that the related spin group Spin(3, 1) or special linear group SL(2, C) acts as the double cover of the Lorentz group (one Lorentz transformation corresponds to two spin transformations of different sign), while the M√∂bius group Con(0,2) or projective special linear group PSL(2, C) is isomorphic to both the Lorentz group and the group of isometries of hyperbolic space.

Lorentz transformations can also be expressed in terms of biquaternions: A Minkowskian quaternion (or minquat) q having one real part and one purely imaginary part is multiplied by biquaternion a applied as pre- and postfactor. Using an overline to denote quaternion conjugation and * for complex conjugation, its general form (on the left) and the corresponding boost (on the right) are as follows:Synge (1972), pp. 13, 19, 24Girard (1984), pp. 28‚Äì29 Often connected with quaternionic systems is the hyperbolic number \\\\varepsilon^{2}=1, which also allows to formulate the Lorentz transformations:Sobczyk (1995)Fjelstad (1986) More extended forms of complex and (bi-)quaternionic systems in terms of Clifford algebra can also be used to express the Lorentz transformations. For instance, using a system a of Clifford numbers one can transform the following general quadratic form into itself, in which the individual values of i_{1}^{2},i_{2}^{2},\\\\dots can be set to +1 or -1 at will, while the Lorentz interval follows if the sign of one i^{2} differs from all others.:Cartan & Study (1908), section 36Rothe (1916), section 16  Lorentz transformation via trigonometric functions  The following general relation connects the speed of light and the relative velocity to hyperbolic and trigonometric functions, where \\\\eta is the rapidity in (), \\\\theta is equivalent to the Gudermannian function {\\\\rm gd}(\\\\eta)=2\\\\arctan(e^{\\\\eta})-\\\\pi/2, and \\\\vartheta is equivalent to the Lobachevskian angle of parallelism \\\\Pi(\\\\eta)=2\\\\arctan(e^{-\\\\eta}): :\\\\frac{v}{c}=\\\\tanh\\\\eta=\\\\sin\\\\theta=\\\\cos\\\\vartheta a) Using \\\\sin\\\\theta=\\\\tfrac{v}{c} one obtains the relations \\\\sec\\\\theta=\\\\gamma and \\\\tan\\\\theta=\\\\beta\\\\gamma, and the Lorentz boost takes the form:Majern√≠k (1986), 536‚Äì538 {\\\\cos\\\\theta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{2}^{\\\\prime} & =x_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{0} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sec\\\\theta+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\tan\\\\theta & & =\\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sin\\\\theta}{\\\\cos\\\\theta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{1} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\tan\\\\theta+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sec\\\\theta & & =\\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\sin\\\\theta+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\cos\\\\theta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{2} & =x_{2}^{\\\\prime} \\\\end{align} \\\\right|{\\\\scriptstyle \\\\begin{align}\\\\tan^{2}\\\\theta-\\\\sec^{2}\\\\theta & =-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\tan\\\\theta}{\\\\sec\\\\theta} & =\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta}} & =\\\\sec\\\\theta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\theta}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta}} & =\\\\tan\\\\theta \\\\end{align} } \\\\end{matrix}|}} b) Using \\\\cos\\\\vartheta=\\\\tfrac{v}{c} one obtains the relations \\\\csc\\\\vartheta=\\\\gamma and \\\\cot\\\\vartheta=\\\\beta\\\\gamma, and the Lorentz boost takes the form: {\\\\sin\\\\vartheta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{2}^{\\\\prime} & =x_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{0} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\csc\\\\vartheta+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cot\\\\vartheta & & =\\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cos\\\\vartheta}{\\\\sin\\\\vartheta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{1} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cot\\\\vartheta+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\csc\\\\vartheta & & =\\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cos\\\\vartheta+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\sin\\\\vartheta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{2} & =x_{2}^{\\\\prime} \\\\end{align} \\\\right|{\\\\scriptstyle \\\\begin{align}\\\\cot^{2}\\\\vartheta-\\\\csc^{2}\\\\vartheta & =-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\cot\\\\vartheta}{\\\\csc\\\\vartheta} & =\\\\cos\\\\vartheta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\cos^{2}\\\\vartheta}} & =\\\\csc\\\\vartheta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\vartheta}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\cos^{2}\\\\vartheta}} & =\\\\cot\\\\vartheta \\\\end{align} } \\\\end{matrix}|}}  Lorentz transformation via squeeze mappings  As already indicated in equations () in exponential form or () in terms of Cayley‚ÄìKlein parameter, Lorentz boosts in terms of hyperbolic rotations can be expressed as squeeze mappings. Using asymptotic coordinates of a hyperbola (u,v), they have the general form (some authors alternatively add a factor of 2 or \\\\sqrt{2}):Terng & Uhlenbeck (2000), p. 21 That this equation system indeed represents a Lorentz boost can be seen by plugging (1) into (2) and solving for the individual variables: Variables u, v in () can be rearranged to produce another form of squeeze mapping, resulting in Lorentz transformation () in terms of Cayley-Hermite parameter: {1-a^{2}}-x_{1}\\\\frac{2a}{1-a^{2}} & & =\\\\frac{x_{0}\\\\left(1+a^{2}\\\\right)-x_{1}2a}{1-a^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{1}^{\\\\prime} & =-x_{0}\\\\frac{2a}{1-a^{2}}+x_{1}\\\\frac{1+a^{2}}{1-a^{2}} & & =\\\\frac{-x_{0}2a+x_{1}\\\\left(1+a^{2}\\\\right)}{1-a^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{0} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{1+a^{2}}{1-a^{2}}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{2a}{1-a^{2}} & & =\\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(1+a^{2}\\\\right)+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}2a}{1-a^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{1} & =x_{0}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{2a}{1-a^{2}}+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{1+a^{2}}{1-a^{2}} & & =\\\\frac{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}2a+x_{1}^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(1+a^{2}\\\\right)}{1-a^{2}} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix}|}} On the basis of factors k or a, all previous Lorentz boosts (, , , ) can be expressed as squeeze mappings as well: & \\\\frac{1+\\\\sin\\\\theta}{\\\\cos\\\\theta} & \\\\frac{1+\\\\cos\\\\vartheta}{\\\\sin\\\\vartheta}=\\\\cot\\\\frac{\\\\vartheta}{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\frac{k-1}{k+1} & a & \\\\tanh\\\\frac{\\\\eta}{2} & \\\\frac{\\\\gamma-1}{\\\\beta\\\\gamma} & \\\\frac{1-\\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\sin\\\\theta}=\\\\tan\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} & \\\\frac{1-\\\\sin\\\\vartheta}{\\\\cos\\\\vartheta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\frac{k^{2}-1}{k^{2}+1} & \\\\frac{2a}{1+a^{2}} & \\\\tanh\\\\eta & \\\\beta & \\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\vartheta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\frac{k^{2}+1}{2k} & \\\\frac{1+a^{2}}{1-a^{2}} & \\\\cosh\\\\eta & \\\\gamma & \\\\sec\\\\theta & \\\\csc\\\\vartheta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\frac{k^{2}-1}{2k} & \\\\frac{2a}{1-a^{2}} & \\\\sinh\\\\eta & \\\\beta\\\\gamma & \\\\tan\\\\theta & \\\\cot\\\\vartheta \\\\end{array}|}} Electrodynamics and special relativity  Voigt (1887)  Woldemar Voigt (1887)Voigt (1887), p. 45 developed a transformation in connection with the Doppler effect and an incompressible medium, being in modern notation:Miller (1981), 114‚Äì115Pais (1982), Kap. 6b :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}\\\\xi_{1} & =x_{1}-\\\\varkappa t\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta_{1} & =y_{1}q\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\zeta_{1} & =z_{1}q\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tau & =t-\\\\frac{\\\\varkappa x_{1}}{\\\\omega^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ q & =\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{\\\\varkappa^{2}}{\\\\omega^{2}}} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =x-vt\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{y}{\\\\gamma}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{z}{\\\\gamma}\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma} & =\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by Œ≥ they are the modern Lorentz transformation (). In Voigt's theory the speed of light is invariant, but his transformations mix up a relativistic boost together with a rescaling of space-time. Optical phenomena in free space are scale, conformal (using the factor Œª discussed above), and Lorentz invariant, so the combination is invariant too. For instance, Lorentz transformations can be extended by using l=\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}:Lorentz (1915/16), p. 197 :x^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma l\\\\left(x-vt\\\\right),\\\\quad y^{\\\\prime}=ly,\\\\quad z^{\\\\prime}=lz,\\\\quad t^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma l\\\\left(t-x\\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}\\\\right). l=1/Œ≥ gives the Voigt transformation, l=1 the Lorentz transformation. But scale transformations are not a symmetry of all the laws of nature, only of electromagnetism, so these transformations cannot be used to formulate a principle of relativity in general. It was demonstrated by Poincar√© and Einstein that one has to set l=1 in order to make the above transformation symmetric and to form a group as required by the relativity principle, therefore the Lorentz transformation is the only viable choice. Voigt sent his 1887 paper to Lorentz in 1908,Voigt's transformations and the beginning of the relativistic revolution, Ricardo Heras, arXiv:1411.2559 and that was acknowledged in 1909: \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial^{2}\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial t^{2}}=0] a transformation equivalent to the formulae (287) and (288) [namely x^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma l\\\\left(x-vt\\\\right),\\\\ y^{\\\\prime}=ly,\\\\ z^{\\\\prime}=lz,\\\\ t^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma l\\\\left(t-\\\\tfrac{v}{c^{2}}x\\\\right)]. The idea of the transformations used above (and in ¬ß 44) might therefore have been borrowed from Voigt and the proof that it does not alter the form of the equations for the free ether is contained in his paper.Lorentz (1915/16), p. 198}} Also Hermann Minkowski said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Voigt responded in the same paper by saying that his theory was based on an elastic theory of light, not an electromagnetic one. However, he concluded that some results were actually the same.Bucherer (1908), p. 762  Heaviside (1888), Thomson (1889), Searle (1896) In 1888, Oliver HeavisideHeaviside (1888), p. 324 investigated the properties of charges in motion according to Maxwell's electrodynamics. He calculated, among other things, anisotropies in the electric field of moving bodies represented by this formula:Brown (2003) :\\\\mathrm{E}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{q\\\\mathrm{r}}{r^{2}}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{v^{2}\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta}{c^{2}}\\\\right)^{-3/2}. Consequently, Joseph John Thomson (1889)Thomson (1889), p. 12 found a way to substantially simplify calculations concerning moving charges by using the following mathematical transformation (like other authors such as Lorentz or Larmor, also Thomson implicitly used the Galilean transformation z-vt in his equation): :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}z & =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega^{2}}{v^{2}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}z'\\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}z^{\\\\ast}=z-vt & =\\\\frac{z'}{\\\\gamma}\\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} Thereby, inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equations are transformed into a Poisson equation.Miller (1981), 98‚Äì99 Eventually, George Frederick Charles SearleSearle (1886), p. 333 noted in (1896) that Heaviside's expression leads to a deformation of electric fields which he called \\"Heaviside-Ellipsoid\\" of axial ratio :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align} & \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha}:1:1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha= & 1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{v^{2}} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}:1:1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma^{2}} & =1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix}  Lorentz (1892, 1895)  In order to explain the aberration of light and the result of the Fizeau experiment in accordance with Maxwell's equations, Lorentz in 1892 developed a model (\\"Lorentz ether theory\\") in which the aether is completely motionless, and the speed of light in the aether is constant in all directions. In order to calculate the optics of moving bodies, Lorentz introduced the following quantities to transform from the aether system into a moving system (it's unknown whether he was influenced by Voigt, Heaviside, and Thomson)Lorentz (1892a), p. 141Miller (1982), 1.4 & 1.5 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathfrak{x} & =\\\\frac{V}{\\\\sqrt{V^{2}-p^{2}}}x\\\\\\\\\\\\ t' & =t-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{V}\\\\mathfrak{x}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon & =\\\\frac{p}{\\\\sqrt{V^{2}-p^{2}}} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\gamma x^{\\\\ast}=\\\\gamma(x-vt)\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{2}vx^{\\\\ast}}{c^{2}}=\\\\gamma^{2}\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma\\\\frac{v}{c} & =\\\\frac{v}{\\\\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} where x* is the Galilean transformation x-vt. Except the additional Œ≥ in the time transformation, this is the complete Lorentz transformation (). While t is the \\"true\\" time for observers resting in the aether, t‚Ä≤ is an auxiliary variable only for calculating processes for moving systems. It is also important that Lorentz and later also Larmor formulated this transformation in two steps. At first an implicit Galilean transformation, and later the expansion into the \\"fictitious\\" electromagnetic system with the aid of the Lorentz transformation. In order to explain the negative result of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, he (1892b)Lorentz (1892b), p. 141 introduced the additional hypothesis that also intermolecular forces are affected in a similar way and introduced length contraction in his theory (without proof as he admitted). The same hypothesis was already made by George FitzGerald in 1889 based on Heaviside's work. While length contraction was a real physical effect for Lorentz, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation. In 1895, Lorentz further elaborated on his theory and introduced the \\"theorem of corresponding states\\". This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the ether) in his \\"fictitious\\" field makes the same observations as a resting observers in his \\"real\\" field for velocities to first order in v/c. Lorentz showed that the dimensions of electrostatic systems in the ether and a moving frame are connected by this transformation:Lorentz (1895), p. 37 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x & =x^{\\\\prime}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{p}^{2}}{V^{2}}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y & =y^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z & =z^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ t & =t^{\\\\prime} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\ast}=x-vt & =\\\\frac{x^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\gamma}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y & =y^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z & =z^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ t & =t^{\\\\prime} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} For solving optical problems Lorentz used the following transformation, in which the modified time variable was called \\"local time\\" () by him:Lorentz (1895), p. 49 for local time and p. 56 for spatial coordinates. :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x & =\\\\mathrm{x}-\\\\mathfrak{p}_{x}t\\\\\\\\\\\\ y & =\\\\mathrm{y}-\\\\mathfrak{p}_{y}t\\\\\\\\\\\\ z & =\\\\mathrm{z}-\\\\mathfrak{p}_{z}t\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-\\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{p}_{x}}{V^{2}}x-\\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{p}_{y}}{V^{2}}y-\\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{p}_{z}}{V^{2}}z \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =x-v_{x}t\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =y-v_{y}t\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =z-v_{z}t\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-\\\\frac{v_{x}}{c^{2}}x'-\\\\frac{v_{y}}{c^{2}}y'-\\\\frac{v_{z}}{c^{2}}z' \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} With this concept Lorentz could explain the Doppler effect, the aberration of light, and the Fizeau experiment.Janssen (1995), 3.1  Larmor (1897, 1900)  In 1897, Larmor extended the work of Lorentz and derived the following transformationLarmor (1897), p. 229 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x_{1} & =x\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{1} & =y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{1} & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-vx/c^{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ dt_{1} & =dt^{\\\\prime}\\\\varepsilon^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon & =\\\\left(1-v^{2}/c^{2}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x_{1} & =\\\\gamma x^{\\\\ast}=\\\\gamma(x-vt)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{1} & =y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{1} & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-\\\\frac{vx^{\\\\ast}}{c^{2}}=t-\\\\frac{v(x-vt)}{c^{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ dt_{1} & =\\\\frac{dt^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\gamma}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma^{2} & =\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} Larmor noted that if it is assumed that the constitution of molecules is electrical then the FitzGerald‚ÄìLorentz contraction is a consequence of this transformation, explaining the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. It's notable that Larmor was the first who recognized that some sort of time dilation is a consequence of this transformation as well, because \\"individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio 1/Œ≥\\".Darrigol (2000), Chap. 8.5Macrossan (1986) Larmor wrote his electrodynamical equations and transformations neglecting terms of higher order than (v/c)2 ‚Äì when his 1897 paper was reprinted in 1929, Larmor added the following comment in which he described how they can be made valid to all orders of v/c:Larmor (1897/1929), p. 39 In line with that comment, in his book Aether and Matter published in 1900, Larmor used a modified local time t‚Ä≥=t‚Ä≤-Œµvx‚Ä≤/c2 instead of the 1897 expression t‚Ä≤=t-vx/c2 by replacing v/c2 with Œµv/c2, so that t‚Ä≥ is now identical to the one given by Lorentz in 1892, which he combined with a Galilean transformation for the x‚Ä≤, y‚Ä≤, z‚Ä≤, t‚Ä≤ coordinates:Larmor (1900), p. 168 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =x-vt\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} & =t^{\\\\prime}-\\\\varepsilon vx^{\\\\prime}/c^{2} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =x-vt\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}=t^{\\\\prime}-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{2}vx^{\\\\prime}}{c^{2}} & =\\\\gamma^{2}\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} Larmor knew that the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment was accurate enough to detect an effect of motion depending on the factor (v/c)2, and so he sought the transformations which were \\"accurate to second order\\" (as he put it). Thus he wrote the final transformations (where x‚Ä≤=x-vt and t‚Ä≥ as given above) as:Larmor (1900), p. 174 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x_{1} & =\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}x^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{1} & =y^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{1} & =z^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ dt_{1} & =\\\\varepsilon^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}dt^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}=\\\\varepsilon^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left(dt^{\\\\prime}-\\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}\\\\varepsilon dx^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ t_{1} & =\\\\varepsilon^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}t^{\\\\prime}-\\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}x^{\\\\prime} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x_{1} & =\\\\gamma x^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma(x-vt)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{1} & =y'=y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{1} & =z'=z\\\\\\\\\\\\ dt_{1} & =\\\\frac{dt^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}{\\\\gamma}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}\\\\left(dt^{\\\\prime}-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{2}vdx^{\\\\prime}}{c^{2}}\\\\right)=\\\\gamma\\\\left(dt-\\\\frac{vdx}{c^{2}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ t_{1} & =\\\\frac{t^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\gamma}-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma vx^{\\\\prime}}{c^{2}}=\\\\gamma\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} by which he arrived at the complete Lorentz transformation (). Larmor showed that Maxwell's equations were invariant under this two-step transformation, \\"to second order in v/c\\" ‚Äì it was later shown by Lorentz (1904) and Poincar√© (1905) that they are indeed invariant under this transformation to all orders in v/c. Larmor gave credit to Lorentz in two papers published in 1904, in which he used the term \\"Lorentz transformation\\" for Lorentz's first order transformations of coordinates and field configurations:  Lorentz (1899, 1904)  Also Lorentz extended his theorem of corresponding states in 1899. First he wrote a transformation equivalent to the one from 1892 (again, x* must be replaced by x-vt):Lorentz (1899), p. 429 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{V}{\\\\sqrt{V^{2}-\\\\mathfrak{p}_{x}^{2}}}x\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-\\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{p}_{x}}{V^{2}-\\\\mathfrak{p}_{x}^{2}}x \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\gamma x^{\\\\ast}=\\\\gamma(x-vt)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =t-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{2}vx^{\\\\ast}}{c^{2}}=\\\\gamma^{2}\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} Then he introduced a factor Œµ of which he said he has no means of determining it, and modified his transformation as follows (where the above value of t‚Ä≤ has to be inserted):Lorentz (1899), p. 439 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x & =\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{k}x^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y & =\\\\varepsilon y^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z & =\\\\varepsilon x^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =k\\\\varepsilon t^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ k & =\\\\frac{V}{\\\\sqrt{V^{2}-\\\\mathfrak{p}_{x}^{2}}} \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\ast}=x-vt & =\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\gamma}x^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y & =\\\\varepsilon y^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z & =\\\\varepsilon z^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma^{2}\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\\\right) & =\\\\gamma\\\\varepsilon t^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} This is equivalent to the complete Lorentz transformation () when solved for x‚Ä≥ and t‚Ä≥ and with Œµ=1. Like Larmor, Lorentz noticed in 1899Lorentz (1899), p. 442 also some sort of time dilation effect in relation to the frequency of oscillating electrons \\"that in S the time of vibrations be kŒµ times as great as in S0\\", where S0 is the aether frame.Jannsen (1995), Kap. 3.3 In 1904 he rewrote the equations in the following form by setting l=1/Œµ (again, x* must be replaced by x-vt):Lorentz (1904), p. 812 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\text{original} & \\\\text{modern}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\left.\\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =klx\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =ly\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =lz\\\\\\\\\\\\ t' & =\\\\frac{l}{k}t-kl\\\\frac{w}{c^{2}}x \\\\end{align} \\\\right& \\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\gamma lx^{\\\\ast}=\\\\gamma l(x-vt)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =ly\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =lz\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\frac{lt}{\\\\gamma}-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma lvx^{\\\\ast}}{c^{2}}=\\\\gamma l\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} Under the assumption that l=1 when v=0, he demonstrated that l=1 must be the case at all velocities, therefore length contraction can only arise in the line of motion. So by setting the factor l to unity, Lorentz's transformations now assumed the same form as Larmor's and are now completed. Unlike Larmor, who restricted himself to show the covariance of Maxwell's equations to second order, Lorentz tried to widen its covariance to all orders in v/c. He also derived the correct formulas for the velocity dependence of electromagnetic mass, and concluded that the transformation formulas must apply to all forces of nature, not only electrical ones.Lorentz (1904), p. 826 However, he didn't achieve full covariance of the transformation equations for charge density and velocity.Miller (1981), Chap. 1.12.2 When the 1904 paper was reprinted in 1913, Lorentz therefore added the following remark:Jannsen (1995), Chap. 3.5.6 Lorentz's 1904 transformation was cited and used by Alfred Bucherer in July 1904:Bucherer, p. 129; Definition of s on p. 32 :x^{\\\\prime}=\\\\sqrt{s}x,\\\\quad y^{\\\\prime}=y,\\\\quad z^{\\\\prime}=z,\\\\quad t'=\\\\frac{t}{\\\\sqrt{s}}-\\\\sqrt{s}\\\\frac{u}{v^{2}}x,\\\\quad s=1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{v^{2}} or by Wilhelm Wien in July 1904:Wien (1904), p. 394 :x=kx',\\\\quad y=y',\\\\quad z=z',\\\\quad t'=kt-\\\\frac{v}{kc^{2}}x or by Emil Cohn in November 1904 (setting the speed of light to unity):Cohn (1904a), pp. 1296-1297 :x=\\\\frac{x_{0}}{k},\\\\quad y=y_{0},\\\\quad z=z_{0},\\\\quad t=kt_{0},\\\\quad t_{1}=t_{0}-w\\\\cdot r_{0},\\\\quad k^{2}=\\\\frac{1}{1-w^{2}} or by Richard Gans in February 1905:Gans (1905), p. 169 :x^{\\\\prime}=kx,\\\\quad y^{\\\\prime}=y,\\\\quad z^{\\\\prime}=z,\\\\quad t'=\\\\frac{t}{k}-\\\\frac{kwx}{c^{2}},\\\\quad k^{2}=\\\\frac{c^{2}}{c^{2}-w^{2}}  Poincar√© (1900, 1905)   Local time  Neither Lorentz or Larmor gave a clear physical interpretation of the origin of local time. However, Henri Poincar√© in 1900 commented on the origin of Lorentz's \\"wonderful invention\\" of local time.Darrigol (2005), Kap. 4 He remarked that it arose when clocks in a moving reference frame are synchronised by exchanging signals which are assumed to travel with the same speed c in both directions, which lead to what is nowadays called relativity of simultaneity, although Poincar√©'s calculation does not involve length contraction or time dilation.Poincar√© (1900), pp. 272‚Äì273 In order to synchronise the clocks here on Earth (the x*, t* frame) a light signal from one clock (at the origin) is sent to another (at x*), and is sent back. It's supposed that the Earth is moving with speed v in the x-direction (= x*-direction) in some rest system (x, t) (i.e. the luminiferous aether system for Lorentz and Larmor). The time of flight outwards is :\\\\delta t_{a}=\\\\frac{x^{\\\\ast}}{\\\\left(c-v\\\\right)} and the time of flight back is :\\\\delta t_{b}=\\\\frac{x^{\\\\ast}}{\\\\left(c+v\\\\right)}. The elapsed time on the clock when the signal is returned is Œ¥ta+Œ¥tb and the time t*=(Œ¥ta+Œ¥tb)/2 is ascribed to the moment when the light signal reached the distant clock. In the rest frame the time t=Œ¥ta is ascribed to that same instant. Some algebra gives the relation between the different time coordinates ascribed to the moment of reflection. Thus :t^{\\\\ast}=t-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{2}vx^{*}}{c^{2}} identical to Lorentz (1892). By dropping the factor Œ≥2 under the assumption that \\\\tfrac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\ll1, Poincar√© gave the result t*=t-vx*/c2, which is the form used by Lorentz in 1895. Similar physical interpretations of local time were later given by Emil Cohn (1904)Cohn (1904b), p. 1408 and Max Abraham (1905).Abraham (1905), ¬ß 42  Lorentz transformation  On June 5, 1905 (published June 9) Poincar√© formulated transformation equations which are algebraically equivalent to those of Larmor and Lorentz and gave them the modern form ():Poincar√© (1905), p. 1505 :\\\\begin{align}x^{\\\\prime} & =kl(x+\\\\varepsilon t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{\\\\prime} & =ly\\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{\\\\prime} & =lz\\\\\\\\\\\\ t' & =kl(t+\\\\varepsilon x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ k & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\varepsilon^{2}}} \\\\end{align} . Apparently Poincar√© was unaware of Larmor's contributions, because he only mentioned Lorentz and therefore used for the first time the name \\"Lorentz transformation\\".Pais (1982), Chap. 6cKatzir (2005), 280‚Äì288 Poincar√© set the speed of light to unity, pointed out the group characteristics of the transformation by setting l=1, and modified/corrected Lorentz's derivation of the equations of electrodynamics in some details in order to fully satisfy the principle of relativity, i.e. making them fully Lorentz covariant.Miller (1981), Chap. 1.14 In July 1905 (published in January 1906)Poincar√© (1905/06), pp. 129ff Poincar√© showed in detail how the transformations and electrodynamic equations are a consequence of the principle of least action; he demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called Lorentz group, and he showed that the combination x2+y2+z2-t2 is invariant. He noticed that the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing ct\\\\sqrt{-1} as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. He also formulated the velocity addition formula (), which he had already derived in unpublished letters to Lorentz from May 1905:Poincar√© (1905/06), p. 144 :\\\\xi'=\\\\frac{\\\\xi+\\\\varepsilon}{1+\\\\xi\\\\varepsilon},\\\\ \\\\eta'=\\\\frac{\\\\eta}{k(1+\\\\xi\\\\varepsilon)}.  Einstein (1905) ‚Äì Special relativity On June 30, 1905 (published September 1905) Einstein published what is now called special relativity and gave a new derivation of the transformation, which was based only on the principle on relativity and the principle of the constancy of the speed of light. While Lorentz considered \\"local time\\" to be a mathematical stipulation device for explaining the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein showed that the coordinates given by the Lorentz transformation were in fact the inertial coordinates of relatively moving frames of reference. For quantities of first order in v/c this was also done by Poincar√© in 1900, while Einstein derived the complete transformation by this method. Unlike Lorentz and Poincar√© who still distinguished between real time in the aether and apparent time for moving observers, Einstein showed that the transformations concern the nature of space and time.Miller (1981), Chap. 6Pais (1982), Kap. 7Darrigol (2005), Chap. 6 The notation for this transformation is equivalent to Poincar√©'s of 1905 and (), except that Einstein didn't set the speed of light to unity:Einstein (1905), p. 902 :\\\\begin{align}\\\\tau & =\\\\beta\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{v}{V^{2}}x\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\xi & =\\\\beta(x-vt)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta & =y\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\zeta & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v}{V}\\\\right)^{2}}} \\\\end{align} Einstein also defined the velocity addition formula (, ):Einstein (1905), ¬ß 5 and ¬ß 9 :\\\\begin{matrix}x=\\\\frac{w_{\\\\xi}+v}{1+\\\\frac{vw_{\\\\xi}}{V^{2}}}t,\\\\ y=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v}{V}\\\\right)^{2}}}{1+\\\\frac{vw_{\\\\xi}}{V^{2}}}w_{\\\\eta}t\\\\\\\\\\\\ U^{2}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{dx}{dt}\\\\right)^{2}+\\\\left(\\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\right)^{2},\\\\ w^{2}=w_{\\\\xi}^{2}+w_{\\\\eta}^{2},\\\\ \\\\alpha=\\\\operatorname{arctg}\\\\frac{w_{y}}{w_{x}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ U=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(v^{2}+w^{2}+2vw\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\right)-\\\\left(\\\\frac{vw\\\\sin\\\\alpha}{V}\\\\right)^{2}}}{1+\\\\frac{vw\\\\cos\\\\alpha}{V^{2}}} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\left|\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{u_{x}-v}{1-\\\\frac{u_{x}v}{V^{2}}}=u_{\\\\xi}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{u_{y}}{\\\\beta\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{u_{x}v}{V^{2}}\\\\right)}=u_{\\\\eta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{u_{z}}{\\\\beta\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{u_{x}v}{V^{2}}\\\\right)}=u_{\\\\zeta} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. and the light aberration formula ():Einstein (1905), ¬ß 7 :\\\\cos\\\\varphi'=\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\varphi-\\\\frac{v}{V}}{1-\\\\frac{v}{V}\\\\cos\\\\varphi}  Minkowski (1907‚Äì1908) ‚Äì Spacetime  The work on the principle of relativity by Lorentz, Einstein, Planck, together with Poincar√©'s four-dimensional approach, were further elaborated and combined with the hyperboloid model by Hermann Minkowski in 1907 and 1908.Minkowski (1907/15), pp. 927ffMinkowski (1907/08), pp. 53ff Minkowski particularly reformulated electrodynamics in a four-dimensional way (Minkowski spacetime).Walter (1999a) For instance, he wrote x, y, z, it in the form x1, x2, x3, x4. By defining œà as the angle of rotation around the z-axis, the Lorentz transformation assumes a form (with c=1) in agreement with ():Minkowski (1907/08), p. 59 :\\\\begin{align}x'_{1} & =x_{1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x'_{2} & =x_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x'_{3} & =x_{3}\\\\cos i\\\\psi+x_{4}\\\\sin i\\\\psi\\\\\\\\\\\\ x'_{4} & =-x_{3}\\\\sin i\\\\psi+x_{4}\\\\cos i\\\\psi\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos i\\\\psi & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-q^{2}}} \\\\end{align} Even though Minkowski used the imaginary number iœà, he for once directly used the tangens hyperbolicus in the equation for velocity :-i\\\\tan i\\\\psi=\\\\frac{e^{\\\\psi}-e^{-\\\\psi}}{e^{\\\\psi}+e^{-\\\\psi}}=q with \\\\psi=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln\\\\frac{1+q}{1-q}. Minkowski's expression can also by written as œà=atanh(q) and was later called rapidity. He also wrote the Lorentz transformation in matrix form equivalent to () (n=3):Minkowski (1907/08), pp. 65‚Äì66, 81‚Äì82 :\\\\begin{matrix}x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2}=x_{1}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{2}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{3}^{\\\\prime2}+x_{4}^{\\\\prime2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(x_{1}^{\\\\prime}=x',\\\\ x_{2}^{\\\\prime}=y',\\\\ x_{3}^{\\\\prime}=z',\\\\ x_{4}^{\\\\prime}=it'\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ -x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}+t^{2}=-x^{\\\\prime2}-y^{\\\\prime2}-z^{\\\\prime2}+t^{\\\\prime2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline x_{h}=\\\\alpha_{h1}x_{1}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\alpha_{h2}x_{2}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\alpha_{h3}x_{3}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\alpha_{h4}x_{4}^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{A}=\\\\mathrm{\\\\left|\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\alpha_{11}, & \\\\alpha_{12}, & \\\\alpha_{13}, & \\\\alpha_{14}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_{21}, & \\\\alpha_{22}, & \\\\alpha_{23}, & \\\\alpha_{24}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_{31}, & \\\\alpha_{32}, & \\\\alpha_{33}, & \\\\alpha_{34}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_{41}, & \\\\alpha_{42}, & \\\\alpha_{43}, & \\\\alpha_{44} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right|,\\\\ \\\\begin{align}\\\\bar{\\\\mathrm{A}}\\\\mathrm{A} & =1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\det \\\\mathrm{A}\\\\right)^{2} & =1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\det \\\\mathrm{A} & =1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_{44} & >0 \\\\end{align} } \\\\end{matrix} As a graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation he introduced the Minkowski diagram, which became a standard tool in textbooks and research articles on relativity:Minkowski (1908/09), p. 77 Original spacetime diagram by Minkowski in 1908.  Sommerfeld (1909) ‚Äì Spherical trigonometry Using an imaginary rapidity such as Minkowski, Arnold Sommerfeld (1909) formulated a transformation equivalent to Lorentz boost (), and the relativistc velocity addition () in terms of trigonometric functions and the spherical law of cosines:Sommerfeld (1909), p. 826ff. :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\left.\\\\begin{array}{lrl} x'= & x\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi+l\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\varphi, & y'=y\\\\\\\\\\\\ l'= & -x\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\varphi+l\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi, & z'=z \\\\end{array}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{tg}\\\\varphi=i\\\\beta,\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^{2}}},\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\varphi=\\\\frac{i\\\\beta}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^{2}}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\beta=\\\\frac{1}{i}\\\\operatorname{tg}\\\\left(\\\\varphi_{1}+\\\\varphi_{2}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{i}\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{tg}\\\\varphi_{1}+\\\\operatorname{tg}\\\\varphi_{2}}{1-\\\\operatorname{tg}\\\\varphi_{1}\\\\operatorname{tg}\\\\varphi_{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\beta_{1}+\\\\beta_{2}}{1+\\\\beta_{1}\\\\beta_{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi=\\\\cos\\\\varphi_{1}\\\\cos\\\\varphi_{2}-\\\\sin\\\\varphi_{1}\\\\sin\\\\varphi_{2}\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\ v^{2}=\\\\frac{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}+2v_{1}v_{2}\\\\cos\\\\alpha-\\\\frac{1}{c^{2}}v_{1}^{2}v_{2}^{2}\\\\sin^{2}\\\\alpha}{\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{1}{c^{2}}v_{1}v_{2}\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{2}} \\\\end{matrix}  Bateman and Cunningham (1909‚Äì1910) ‚Äì Spherical wave transformation In line with Lie's (1871) research on the relation between sphere transformations with an imaginary radius coordinate and 4D conformal transformations, it was pointed out by Bateman and Cunningham (1909‚Äì1910), that by setting u=ict as the imaginary fourth coordinates one can produce spacetime conformal transformations. Not only the quadratic form \\\\lambda\\\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}+du^{2}\\\\right), but also Maxwells equations are covariant with respect to these transformations, irrespective of the choice of Œª. These variants of conformal or Lie sphere transformations were called spherical wave transformations by Bateman.Bateman (1909/10), pp. 223ffCunningham (1909/10), pp. 77ff However, this covariance is restricted to certain areas such as electrodynamics, whereas the totality of natural laws in inertial frames is covariant under the Lorentz group.Klein (1910) In particular, by setting Œª=1 the Lorentz group can be seen as a 10-parameter subgroup of the 15-parameter spacetime conformal group . Bateman (1910/12)Bateman (1910/12), pp. 358‚Äì359 also alluded to the identity between the Laguerre inversion and the Lorentz transformations. In general, the isomorphism between the Laguerre group and the Lorentz group was pointed out by √âlie Cartan (1912, 1915/55),Cartan (1912), p. 23 Henri Poincar√© (1912/21)Poincar√© (1912/21), p. 145 and others.  Herglotz (1909/10) ‚Äì M√∂bius transformation  Following Klein (1889‚Äì1897) and Fricke & Klein (1897) concerning the Cayley absolute, hyperbolic motion and its transformation, Gustav Herglotz (1909/10) classified the one-parameter Lorentz transformations as loxodromic, hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. The general case (on the left) equivalent to Lorentz transformation () and the hyperbolic case (on the right) equivalent to Lorentz transformation () or squeeze mapping () are as follows:Herglotz (1909/10), pp. 404-408 :\\\\left.\\\\begin{matrix}z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}-z_{4}^{2}=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{1}=x,\\\\ z_{2}=y,\\\\ z_{3}=z,\\\\ z_{4}=t\\\\\\\\\\\\ Z=\\\\frac{z_{1}+iz_{2}}{z_{4}-z_{3}}=\\\\frac{x+iy}{t-z},\\\\ Z'=\\\\frac{x'+iy'}{t'-z'}\\\\\\\\\\\\ Z=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha Z'+\\\\beta}{\\\\gamma Z'+\\\\delta} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right|\\\\begin{matrix}Z=Z'e^{\\\\vartheta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\begin{align}x & =x', & t-z & =(t'-z')e^{\\\\vartheta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y & =y', & t+z & =(t'+z')e^{-\\\\vartheta} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix}  Variƒáak (1910) ‚Äì Hyperbolic functions Following Sommerfeld (1909), hyperbolic functions were used by Vladimir Variƒáak in several papers starting from 1910, who represented the equations of special relativity on the basis of hyperbolic geometry in terms of Weierstrass coordinates. For instance, by setting l=ct and v/c=tanh(u) with u as rapidity he wrote the Lorentz transformation in agreement with ():Variƒáak (1910), p. 93 :\\\\begin{align}l' & =-x\\\\operatorname{sh}u+l\\\\operatorname{ch}u,\\\\\\\\\\\\ x' & =x\\\\operatorname{ch}u-l\\\\operatorname{sh}u,\\\\\\\\\\\\ y' & =y,\\\\quad z'=z,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{ch}u & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}} \\\\end{align} and showed the relation of rapidity to the Gudermannian function and the angle of parallelism: :\\\\frac{v}{c}=\\\\operatorname{th}u=\\\\operatorname{tg}\\\\psi=\\\\sin\\\\operatorname{gd}(u)=\\\\cos\\\\Pi(u) He also related the velocity addition to the hyperbolic law of cosines:Variƒáak (1910), p. 94 :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\operatorname{ch}{u}=\\\\operatorname{ch}{u_{1}}\\\\operatorname ch{u_{2}}+\\\\operatorname{sh}{u_{1}}\\\\operatorname{sh}{u_{2}}\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{ch}{u_{i}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v_{i}}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}},\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sh}{u_{i}}=\\\\frac{v_{i}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v_{i}}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ v=\\\\sqrt{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v_{1}v_{2}}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}\\\\ \\\\left(a=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right) \\\\end{matrix} Subsequently, other authors such as E. T. Whittaker (1910) or Alfred Robb (1911, who coined the name rapidity) used similar expressions, which are still used in modern textbooks.  Ignatowski (1910)  While earlier derivations and formulations of the Lorentz transformation relied from the outset on optics, electrodynamics, or the invariance of the speed of light, Vladimir Ignatowski (1910) showed that it is possible to use the principle of relativity (and related group theoretical principles) alone, in order to derive the following transformation between two inertial frames:Ignatowski (1910), pp. 973‚Äì974Ignatowski (1910/11), p. 13 :\\\\begin{align}dx' & =p\\\\ dx-pq\\\\ dt\\\\\\\\\\\\ dt' & =-pqn\\\\ dx+p\\\\ dt\\\\\\\\\\\\ p & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-q^{2}n}} \\\\end{align} The variable n can be seen as a space-time constant whose value has to be determined by experiment or taken from a known physical law such as electrodynamics. For that purpose, Ignatowski used the above-mentioned Heaviside ellipsoid representing a contraction of electrostatic fields by x/Œ≥ in the direction of motion. It can be seen that this is only consistent with Ignatowski's transformation when n=1/c2, resulting in p=Œ≥ and the Lorentz transformation (). With n=0, no length changes arise and the Galilean transformation follows. Ignatowski's method was further developed and improved by Philipp Frank and Hermann Rothe (1911, 1912),Frank & Rothe (1911), pp. 825ff; (1912), p. 750ff. with various authors developing similar methods in subsequent years.Baccetti (2011), see references 1‚Äì25 therein.  Noether (1910), Klein (1910) ‚Äì Quaternions Felix Klein (1908) described Cayley's (1854) 4D quaternion multiplications as \\"Drehstreckungen\\" (orthogonal substitutions in terms of rotations leaving invariant a quadratic form up to a factor), and pointed out that the modern principle of relativity as provided by Minkowski is essentially only the consequent application of such Drehstreckungen, even though he didn't provide details.Klein (1908), p. 165 In an appendix to Klein's and Sommerfeld's \\"Theory of the top\\" (1910), Fritz Noether showed how to formulate hyperbolic rotations using biquaternions with \\\\omega=\\\\sqrt{-1}, which he also related to the speed of light by setting œâ2=-c2. He concluded that this is the principal ingredient for a rational representation of the group of Lorentz transformations equivalent to ():Noether (1910), pp. 939‚Äì943 :\\\\begin{matrix}V=\\\\frac{Q_{1}vQ_{2}}{T_{1}T_{2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline X^{2}+Y^{2}+Z^{2}+\\\\omega^{2}S^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+\\\\omega^{2}s^{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\begin{align}V & =Xi+Yj+Zk+\\\\omega S\\\\\\\\\\\\ v & =xi+yj+zk+\\\\omega s\\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_{1} & =(+Ai+Bj+Ck+D)+\\\\omega(A'i+B'j+C'k+D')\\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_{2} & =(-Ai-Bj- Ck+D)+\\\\omega(A'i+B'j+C'k-D')\\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{1}T_{2} & =T_{1}^{2}=T_{2}^{2}=A^{2}+B^{2}+C^{2}+D^{2}+\\\\omega^{2}\\\\left(A^{\\\\prime2}+B^{\\\\prime2}+C^{\\\\prime2}+D^{\\\\prime2}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{matrix} Besides citing quaternion related standard works such as Cayley (1854), Noether referred to the entries in Klein's encyclopedia by Eduard Study (1899) and the French version by √âlie Cartan (1908).Cartan & Study (1908), sections 35‚Äì36 Cartan's version contains a description of Study's dual numbers, Clifford's biquaternions (including the choice \\\\omega=\\\\sqrt{-1} for hyperbolic geometry), and Clifford algebra, with references to Stephanos (1883), Buchheim (1884/85), Vahlen (1901/02) and others.

concept. In mathematical terms, Lorentz transformations are squeeze mappings, the linear transformations that turn a square into a rectangles of the same area. Before Euler, the squeezing was studied as quadrature of the hyperbola and led to the hyperbolic logarithm. In 1748 Euler issued his precalculus textbook where the number e is exploited for trigonometry in the unit circle. The first volume of Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite had no diagrams, allowing teachers and students to draw their own illustrations. There is a gap in Euler's text where Lorentz transformations arise. A feature of natural logarithm is its interpretation as area in hyperbolic sectors. In relativity the classical concept of velocity is replaced with rapidity, a hyperbolic angle concept built on hyperbolic sectors. A Lorentz transformation is a hyperbolic rotation which preserves differences of rapidity, just as the circular sector area is preserved with a circular rotation. Euler's gap is the lack of hyperbolic angle and hyperbolic functions, later developed by Johann H. Lambert. Euler described some transcendental functions: exponentiation and circular functions. He used the exponential series \\\\sum_0^{\\\\infty} x^n /n! . With the imaginary unit i2 = ‚Äì 1, and splitting the series into even and odd terms, he obtained :e^{ix} = \\\\sum_0^{\\\\infty} (ix)^{2n}/(2n)! \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\sum_0^{\\\\infty} (ix)^{2n+1}/(2n + 1)! = := \\\\sum_0^{\\\\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n} / 2n! + i \\\\sum_0^{\\\\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n+1}/(2n+1)! \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\cos x + i \\\\sin x . This development misses the alternative: :e^x = \\\\cosh x + \\\\sinh x (even and odd terms), and :e^{jx} = \\\\cosh x + j \\\\sinh x \\\\quad (j^2 = +1) which parametrizes the unit hyperbola. Here Euler could have noted split-complex numbers along with complex numbers. For physics, one space dimension is insufficient. But to extend split-complex arithmetic to four dimensions leads to hyperbolic quaternions, and opens the door to abstract algebra's hypercomplex numbers. Reviewing the expressions of Lorentz and Einstein, one observes that the Lorentz factor is an algebraic function of velocity. For readers uncomfortable with transcendental functions cosh and sinh, algebraic functions may be more to their liking.

It was first published by Ballantine Books on June 12, 1976. It was the fourth novel in Kurtz' Deryni novels to be published, and the first book in her second Deryni trilogy, The Legends of Camber of Culdi. The Legends trilogy serves as prequels to The Chronicles of the Deryni series that Kurtz wrote from 1970 to 1973, and it details the events that occurred two centuries before the Chronicles trilogy. Therefore, although it was the fourth Deryni novel to be published, Camber of Culdi is the earliest novel to occur within the series' internal literary chronology. Plot introduction The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms. Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom similar to the British Isles of the 10th century, with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of Gwynedd includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent psychic and magical abilities. The novel takes place eight decades after a foreign Deryni prince invaded Gwynedd and overthrew the human king. Though still a minority of the population, Deryni control the throne, the Church, and almost all positions of power throughout the realm, and many lead privileged lives at the expense of the human majority. However, a wave of human resentment in starting to surge throughout the kingdom, and a powerful Deryni lord embarks on a quest to restore the ancient line of Haldane kings. Plot summary The novel spans the time period between September 903 and December 904, beginning shortly after the murder of a Deryni lord named Rannulf. Unable to locate Rannulf's murderer, King Imre Furst√°n-Festil issues a decree ordering the deaths of fifty human peasants unless the murderer is identified. The peasants are tenants of Earl Camber MacRorie of Culdi, a respected Deryni master who formerly served Imre's father. Meanwhile, the Healer Rhys Thuryn attends the final hours of an elderly patient. Before his death, the patient confides that he is really Prince Aidan Haldane, the sole survivor of the Deryni coup that overthrew the Haldane kings eight decades earlier. He begs Rhys to seek out his grandson, Prince Cinhil Haldane, who is the last remaining member of the former royal bloodline. Rhys recruits the assistance of Father Joram MacRorie, and the two of them determine that Cinhil is one of five monks living in seclusion in various religious houses throughout the realm. Before continuing their search, they seek the counsel of Joram's father, Earl Camber. In the capital city of Valoret, Lord Cathan MacRorie, Camber's eldest son and heir, continues to request mercy for the imprisoned peasants. Although a close friend of the king, Cathan is unable to persuade Imre to revoke his decree. However, Imre permits Cathan to save just one of the peasants, forcing him to personally choose from among the doomed commoners. Unable to prevent the executions, Cathan nearly goes mad with grief. Rhys and Joram continue their search for the Haldane prince, but it is Camber and Rhys who eventually discover Cinhil, who is living the peaceful religious life of a monk in a secluded abbey. Unwilling to compromise Cathan's position at court, they do not tell Cathan of their discovery, but Cathan's position is already being undermined by his ambitious brother-in-law, Lord Coel Howell. Coel continually sows mistrust between Imre and Cathan, and eventually succeeds in framing Cathan for the murder of another Deryni lord. Convinced that Cathan has betrayed him, Imre murders his friend. Racked with grief and self-loathing, Imre seeks comfort in the arms of his sister, Princess Ariella, and soon begins an incestuous relationship with her. Cathan's body is returned to his father, who decides to immediately move forward with his plans to overthrow Imre. After dispatching Joram and Rhys to retrieve Cinhil, Camber and his daughter, Evaine, meet with the Michaelines, a militant religious order who has agreed to provide military support for the upcoming coup attempt. Soon thereafter, Imre's suspicions grow to include the entire MacRorie family, and he soon orders their arrest. However, the MacRories manage to escape capture, and the entire Michaeline order goes into hiding to elude Imre's wrath. Rhys and Joram manage to abduct Cinhil, but the prince is unwilling to abandon his religious life. Although Camber and his allies attempt to convince Cinhil that he must become king for the greater good of the realm, the anguished prince is haunted by his conscience and his heart-felt vocation as a priest. Nonetheless, Camber continues to prepare Cinhil for the throne, attempting to teach him about the secular world that he abandoned. Camber eventually convinces Archbishop Anscom, the Archbishop of Valoret and one of Camber's oldest friends, to support their cause. Anscom absolves Cinhil's religious vows, acknowledges him as the legitimate heir to the throne, and presides over his marriage to Camber's ward. After several months of working with Cinhil, Camber becomes convinced that Cinhil has the unique ability to acquire Deryni- like powers. Assisted by several members of his family, Camber performs a ritual designed to bestow Deryni powers on the prince. Although they believe the ritual to be successful, Cinhil refuses to display any indication of his new abilities for several months. However, at the baptism of his son several months later, Cinhil's powers become clearly evident. When his son is poisoned by an unwitting assassin, the furious prince uses his powers to locate and kill the murderer. From that point on, Cinhil becomes dedicated to avenging his slain son, vowing to overthrow and kill Imre. In December, the coup is finally launched. Using several Transfer Portals, Camber, Cinhil, and their Michaeline allies infiltrate the royal palace in Valoret in the middle of the night. Their forces quickly overcome the guards, and soon burst into the royal bedchamber. While Imre is captured, his sister escapes through a secret passage, bearing her brother's child in her womb. Imre lashes out with his powers at Cinhil, but the Haldane prince uses his own powers to withstand the attack. Realizing he cannot win, Imre commits suicide rather than submit to imprisonment. As the fighting comes to an end, Camber crowns Cinhil as King of Gwynedd.

History The Balmain East ferry wharf has been operating since the 1840s as Balmain's main wharf. Originally, watermen offered the first services on demand in small rowing skiffs or sailing dinghies. In February 1844 the steamer Waterman commenced the first public ferry service between Balmain and the Australian Gas Light Company wharf at Millers Point.Madras ‚Äì The New Light House The Sydney Morning Herald 1 March 1844 page 2 The service was established by Henry Perdriau, the owner of Perdriau Ferries, later Balmain Steam Ferries.Spindler, Graham, \\"Harbour Circle Walk: Notes on Loop & Alternative walks\\", New South Wales Department of Planning, 2006.

As the road next to the wharf had a grade of 1 in 8, a unique counterweight dummy system was installed under the road surface to help push trams up the hill. An underground counterweight system was connected by cable to a cable tram grip dummy on the track on the surface. A tram descending would push the grip dummy ahead of it (which raised the counterweight). On the return journey, the grip dummy would give the tram a helpful push. The mechanism was preserved at the Sydney Tramway Museum when the tramway was removed.Railpage Australia, \\"Tramways of Australia: Sydney's tram history\\", 18 August 1997. Accessed 14 March 2007.

His type of barbed wire was in direct competition with the other barbed wire manufacturers in DeKalb, Illinois. He was a known carpenter and architect in DeKalb County and designed several prominent DeKalb homes.Bigolin, Steve. The Landmarks of Barb City - Part 43C, Daily Chronicle, 7 March 2005. Retrieved 21 February 2007. Early life Haish was born in Germany and immigrated with his family to the United States in 1835. He came to Illinois in 1845, and moved to DeKalb in 1853, where he was a carpenter. He cultivated osage orange hedges whose thorns made them effective as cattle fencing. The birth of barbed wire In late 1872, Henry Rose developed a wire fence with an attached wooden strip containing projecting wire points to dissuade encroaching livestock. He patented his fence in May 1873 and exhibited it at the DeKalb County Fair that summer. This prompted Haish and other DeKalb residents Isaac Ellwood and Joseph Glidden to work on improving the concept. Haish had patented three styles of barbed fencing by June 1874. When Haish's patent for an \\"S-barb\\" design was granted in August 1875, he launched a drawn out legal battle to stymie his rivals. It failed at the US Supreme Court in 1895. Haish gifts a library In 1893, the city council of DeKalb, Illinois, decreed the establishment of a public library. The impetus for this ordinance was requests from the Ladies of the Library Association, a group that had conducted a reading room for several years. The library moved twice before the Haish gift came along; it was first located on the second floor of the city hall and then, in 1923, moved to the second floor of the DeKalb Daily Chronicle building on Lincoln Highway. Haish had bequested a $150,000 gift for a library building in his will. The result was the Haish Memorial Library in downtown DeKalb. See also * George H. Gurler House * Joseph F.

It has been the most watched news program in Davao City and Davao Region. The newscast is a tabloid-style format and delivers news headlines about the current events in Southern Mindanao. It is aired live daily from ABS-CBN Davao Newscenter at 5:00p.m., from Monday to Friday, simulcast on TV-24 Mati, Davao Oriental and on radio via DXAB Radyo Patrol 1296 & MOR 101.1 Davao. The program is also shown abroad through The Filipino Channel and ABS- CBN Regional Channel. It replays at 12:30a.m. on ANC. It also produces its bulletin version News Patrol Southern Mindanao that airs several times a day every weekdays. TV Patrol Southern Mindanao maintains a 24-hour shift of reporters, cameramen and drivers with coverage over the provinces of Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Davao Oriental and Davao de Oro. History As TV Patrol Mindanao (1989‚Äì1997; 2001‚Äì2005) As ABS-CBN began national programming via satellite in stages in 1989 it considered the creation of a regional newscast for the millions of people of Mindanao island and the islands around it. The year before, buoyed by the success of its regional news programming in the Visayas, the network selected Channel 4 Davao as the next to begin regional newscasts. By then only Channel 9, its affiliate station in Zamboanga City, had carried regional news for its viewers in the Zamboanga Peninsula and beyond. The program was launched on January 16, 1989 as TV Patrol Mindanao, the pioneer Cebuano language local newscast in the Mindanao area. Dante Luzon was its first anchor with Annie Gacayan, Christina Banluta, Tina Junsay, Manny Casiple, Helen Lorenzana, Rocky Magsanoc and Bert Gorgonio as its first reporters and was initially broadcast in Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Pagadian, Butuan, General Santos, Cotabato and Zamboanga. It had covered stories ranging from natural disasters, man-made disasters, religious conflicts, tribal conflicts, political controversies, social issues and crime stories in the entire Mindanao island. In late 1989, Dante left to join what is now the TV Patrol Central Visayas anchor team in Cebu as co-main presenter, and was replaced by Casiple in the anchor chair with Gorgonio, Junsay and Gacayan, adopting a four-presenter format to match the then format in the national edition. At the same year satellite transmissions were launched to reach the Cebuano-speaking populations all over the island, enabling them to watch the newscast live as it happens. In 1993, Alex Santos joined the newscast with Gacayan and Gorgonio, as Casiple ended anchoring the newscast. In 1994, Art Bonjoc, Jr was added in the newscast as co-anchor. In the 2001 reformat, it was anchored by Girlie Balaba (brand then reverted to TV Patrol Mindanao) and Stephen Manangan. As TV Patrol Davao (1997‚Äì2001) After Luzon left the program and a four-presenter format was introduced, in the mid-1990s the newscast was reformatted and coverage was eventually reduced as other TV Patrol regional editions were being launched in other ABS-CBN regional stations in Mindanao. Its later anchors included Cristina Banluta, Girlie Balaba, and Aljo Bendijo (who would later anchor TV Patrol in Manila from 2001 to 2003) and in 2000 After Bendijo's departure in Davao he replaced by Stephen Manangan. As TV Patrol Southern Mindanao (2005‚Äì2020) The program was renamed to its current name in 2005. In 2006, Dante Luzon returned to the regional newscast as an alternate anchor. In 2007, Stephen Manangan and Melanie Severino became the main anchors. The newscenter set of TV Patrol Southern Mindanao uses Augmented Reality (AR) technology, similar to that of main newscast TV Patrol. Logo used from August 19, 2013 until December 30, 2016. On November 15, 2010, Paul Palacio took over the vacant anchor chair. The newscast had later introduced once again their new logo and set, making them the first regional group to do so since TV Patrol revamped a week earlier. During the 22nd Anniversary of TV Patrol Southern Mindanao, a new studio and a slight change on its opening billboard was unveiled. Augmented reality was also used for live reports, similar to that of the national TV Patrol. In May 2011, Melanie Severino returned to the newscast after a 6-month absence. On August 19, 2013, TV Patrol Southern Mindanao updated its graphics similar to the main national newscast. On January 31, 2014, the program celebrated its 25th Anniversary, changed its opening billboard similar to the national newscast, and added '25' to its title card. On January 2, 2017, TV Patrol Southern Mindanao updated its opening billboard, title card and graphics similar to the main national newscast which took effect 6 months earlier and the newscast was stopped on DXAB Radyo Patrol 1296 which was aired in slightly-delayed basis similar to the rival newscast of GMA Davao's 24 Oras Davao (since 2017 rebranded as One Mindanao) from the radio station DXGM Super Radyo 1125. The live simulcast will once again take effect on July 2, 2018. From August 20 to September 21, 2018, Severino was situated in studio & Palacio was situated in live places in the Davao Region, temporarily set for the new studio. On September 24, 2018, the existing studio set was refreshed in a design similar to the main national newscast, Palacio returnedto the studio. On January 16, 2019, the program celebrated its 30th Anniversary. On March 16, 2020, the program started its live simulcast over MOR 101.1 Davao For Life!, becoming the second TV Patrol Regional newscast to simulcast on both a Radyo Patrol and an MOR station. However, due to the cease and desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission, it's currently aired online via Facebook, YouTube and iWant, it will replay at 12:30 am on ANC. The newscast aired its final episode on August 28, 2020 as a result of retrenchments after bills for the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise was denied by the Congress of the Philippines.

He was the author of 19 novels and numerous works of history. He was one of South Africa's most honoured authors. Schoeman wrote primarily in Afrikaans, although several of his non-fiction books were originally written in English. His novels are increasingly being translated into other languages, notably, English, French and Dutch. Life and career Born in 1939 in Trompsburg, South Africa, Karel Schoeman matriculated in 1956 from Paarl Boys' High School. In 1959, he obtained a BA degree in languages from the University of the Free State. In 1961, he joined the Franciscan Order in Ireland as a novice for the priesthood, but then returned to Bloemfontein to obtain a Higher Diploma in Library Studies. During the 1970s, he went into voluntary exile, working first as a librarian in Amsterdam and then as a nurse in Glasgow, Scotland. He returned to South Africa in 1977 and worked until his retirement in 1998 as an archivist at the South African National Library in Cape Town. He then relocated to his town of birth, Trompsburg, where he lived for more than a decade before moving to Bloemfontein. In September 2008, he moved to the Noorderbloem retirement community, where he died on 1 May 2017. Schoeman is known not only as a novelist, but is equally renowned as an historian and biographer. He has also published translations (especially of drama), several travel books and an autobiography. He won the most prestigious Afrikaans literary award, the Hertzog Prize, three times: in 1971 (for By Fakkellig, ‚Äôn Lug vol helder wolke and Spiraal), 1986 (‚Äôn Ander land) and in 1995 (Hierdie lewe).Hertzog Prize The Recht Malan Prize for \\"excellence in the field of non-fiction books\\" was awarded to him four times.Media24 Books Literary Awards On the retirement of President Nelson Mandela in 1999, Schoeman was one of only two writers to be awarded the State President Award: Order for Excellent Service. In more recent years, his fiction garnered much praise in France, winning inter alia the prestigious Prix du Meilleur Livre √âtranger in 2009. In the last years of his life, it was rumored that he was a possible candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-who-will-win-the- nobel-prize-in- literature-20141006-story.html#http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2014/10/02/punters- put-karel-schoeman-at-191-for-the-nobel-prize-in-literature/ His 1972 novel, Na die Geliefde Land (literally: To the Beloved Country), was made into an award-winning feature film, Promised Land in 2002, with a screenplay by Jason Xenopoulos. Schoeman has produced and published several screenplays, including an adaptation of his first novel, Veldslag, some of which were broadcast on South African national television during the 1980s.Burger & Van Vuuren, Sluiswagter by die Dam van Stemme, pp. 365‚Äì66, 370. His published screenplays include Besoek (1975), Somerpaleis (1975), Die Jare (1976) and Veldslag (1989). Op die Grens was broadcast in 1988, but never published. Schoeman committed suicide at a retirement center in Bloemfontein, at the age of 77, writing about dying with dignity in his suicide statement. A previous attempt failed when he was 75.

The editor-in-chief was Isaac Don Levine. Description Plain Talk featured articles by many conservative writers of the time, including John Chamberlain, Suzanne La Follette, Eugene Lyons, George S. Schuyler, and Ralph de Toledano. The magazine was published on a monthly basis. History In the 1970s, Levine wrote that in July 1946 Benjamin Mandel (a \\"guide to the mission\\" of the magazine), had accompanied by Father John F. Cronin and Alfred Kohlberg, approached Levine at his Norwalk, Connecticut, home. Kohlberg funded $25,000 for it plus a free office, plus funding for five staffers. The magazine was established in 1946 and the first issue appeared in October 1946. Due to low circulation and readership levels the magazine ceased publication in May 1950. Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover had provided some funding, but, \\"half-hearted,\\" it did not succeed in shoring up the magazine. Connected to the magazine was the name Theodore Cooper Kirkpatrick, who, with fellow ex-FBI agent Kenneth M. Bierly, was implicated in \\"pirating\\" of security informants for Plain Talk magazine and soon thereafter for Counterattack newsletter. Kirkpatrick and Bierly also used FBI information to capitalize upon their FBI association. Kirkpatrick and Bierly joined with a third ex-FBI agent, John G. Keenan, first to form \\"John Quincy Adams Associates\\" in Washington, DC, and then \\"American Business Consultants, Inc.,\\" in New York City, publisher of Counterattack newsletter. Demise Starting in 1950, several writers and editors from Plain Talk subsequently worked for The Freeman, which was founded later that year and acquired the Plain Talk subscription list.

Prompts are mouthed silently or hurled lyrically in a half-voice, audible (hopefully) only on stage. (This is in contrast to the prompter in a theatre who aids actors who have forgotten their words or lines.) Opera prompters are traditionally housed in a stuffy wooden box at the center-front edge of the stage, above the orchestra pit. They are visible to the performers and no one else. Technology has brought cool air and small display screens, among other advances, to support their work. Effective prompting can be a challenge. The American prompter Philip Eisenberg recounted the story of a Maria Callas performance during which she needed louder prompts. The famed diva swooped down in a curtsy right in front of the prompter‚Äôs box and ‚Äî mid-curtsy, unnoticed by the audience ‚Äî gave the Italian command \\"pi√π forte!\\" (louder) to her boxed colleague. Prompters attend all rehearsals, mark up any adjustments or clarifications to the score, and generally \\"prepare\\" singers for a role. Their profile is low, and opera program books often credit them only under \\"musical preparation\\" or some similar moniker.

The Enchanters Three first appear in Thor #143-144 (Aug.-Sept. 1967), and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Publication history The group first appeared in Thor #143-145 (Aug. - Oct.1967), and did not appear in Marvel continuity again (on this occasion with a new member) until thirty one years later in Thor vol. 2, #15 - 19 (Sept. 1999 - Jan. 2000). Fictional character biography The Enchanters are apparently brothers and hail from the realm of Ringsfjord, which exists on the extra-dimensional continent of Asgard. The original three Enchanters are Forsung, Brona and Magnir, sorcerers whose power is amplified by the Living Talismans in their possession. Brona and Magnir are first encountered by the Asgardian warriors Balder and Sif, who follow the pair and decide to conquer Asgard and then Earth. Balder and Sif escape to Earth to warn the Thunder God Thor of the impending threat, unaware that Brona and Magnir are following. Forsung travels to Asgard and confronts Odin directly. Thor and his fellow Asgardians defeat the Enchanters, while after a long and protracted battle Odin slays Forsung and crushes his Living Talisman. Odin then banishes Brona and Magnir to a limbo-like dimension.Thor #143 - 145 (Aug. - Oct. 1967) Thor eventually discovers he is having difficulty controlling his magical hammer Mjolnir, which veers away when thrown and on occasion does not return. During a battle with the Absorbing Man, Mjolnir becomes lodged in a wall and does not return. Thor reverts to his current mortal persona of Jake Olsen, who is subsequently given a heart attack by a being that emerges from Mjolnir: Enrakt, the newest Enchanter. Enrakt is the youngest of the brothers and was apparently still in training during the first battle with the Asgardians. Although the Warriors Three come to Thor's aid, they are defeated by Enrakt, who brags that his now free brothers - Brona and Magnir - are attacking Odin at that very moment. Jake Olsen takes advantage of the melee to reclaim Mjolnir, and as Thor fights Enrakt to a standstill, then escapes to Asgard. Aided by fellow Avenger the Scarlet Witch, Thor travels to Asgard, where together with Odin the trio are swallowed by a gigantic serpent summoned by Enrakt. Freeing themselves, the group confront the Enchanters Three, with Odin defeating Brona and crushing his Living Amulet; the Scarlet Witch trapping Magnir in solid rock and Thor almost beating Enrakt to death. At the suggestion of Odin, Thor unmasks Enrakt to discover it is actually the corpse of \\"Ceranda\\", a woman Thor met off-world and once loved. Enrakt had been using her body - and Mjolnir - to hold his spirit. Enrakt's spirit, together with Brona and Magnir, is banished and Ceranda's body is placed in state in a memorial hall in Asgard.Thor vol. 2, #15 - 19 (Sept. 1999 - Jan. 2000) Powers and abilities Each of the Enchanters wears a sentient talisman carved in the image of a stone face on their chests.

Another source from approximately 1880 reports a total of 1,516 inhabitants (978 Jews) with 313 houses, two Russian Orthodox churches, and two Jewish synagogues. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lyubavichi was the largest market within the Mogilev Governorate, with annual sales of more than 1.5 million rubles. Jewish community The Jewish population of Lyubavichi was 1,164 in 1847 and 1,660 in 1897. The village's economy declined after the 1917 Russian Revolution and religious Jews were persecuted by the Yevsektsiya. The Jewish population was 967 in 1926, half of the total population. During the German invasion of Russia, the German military entered Lyubavichi in August 1941, established a ghetto, and massacred the 483 remaining Jews on November 4, 1941. Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty The village lends its name to the Chabad- Lubavitch branch of Hasidic Judaism where its leadership established a court and was the seat of four generations of Chabad Rebbes between 1813 and 1915. The second Chabad Rebbe, Dovber Schneuri (1773-1827), moved from Lyady to Lyubavichi in 1813. The third Rebbe of Chabad, Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (1789‚Äì1866) and the fourth Rebbe, Shmuel Schneersohn (1834‚Äì1882) are buried in Lyubavichi. The fifth Rebbe, Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, (1860-1920) established the Yeshivah Tomchei Temimim Lubavitch in the village in the summer of 1897. In the fall of 1915, the rebbe evacuated his Hassidic court to Rostov, Russia with the onset of World War I.http://www.shturem.net/index.php?section=artdays&id;=2545 The central yeshivah was disbanded in 1917 and its students went into exile before its reestablishment by the Rebbe in Rostov. The Chabad movement opened an information center in the village in 2008 called Hatzer Raboteinu Nesieinu Belubavitch. The center is in the former Jewish area of the village and close to the graves of the two Rebbes. The European Conference of Shluchim brought 500 Chabad rabbis to the village in August 2016 to visit the graves and tour the village.

Callendar was the first to design and build an accurate platinum resistance thermometer suitable for use, which allowed scientists and engineers to obtain consistent and accurate results. He conducted experiments and researched thermodynamics, producing and publishing reliable tables on the thermodynamic properties of steam used for calculations. Callendar worked with multiple institutions during World War 1, helping to research and develop useful tools for the Navy. Callendar received awards such as the James Watt Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1898) and the Rumford Medal (1906). He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and later a member of the Physical Society of London. Callendar was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics three times. He died at home in Ealing, after an operation in 1930.Fleming, James Rodger (2007) The Callendar Effect: The Life and Work of Guy Stewart Callendar (1898‚Äì1964), the Scientist Who Established the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change. American Meteorological Society.  Birth & education  Callendar was born in Hatherop, Gloucestershire as the eldest son of the Reverend Hugh Callendar, a local Anglican rector, and Anne Cecilia Longbourne. He was christened in his father‚Äôs church on May 24, 1863. His father died in 1867. Callendar developed his skills language and mathematics from a young age with assistance from a private tutor, building multiple devices such as induction coils and generators, and teaching himself morse code by age 10. At age 11, Callendar began his education at Malborough College, where he participated in football and represented the college in both shooting and gymnastics. Callendar began studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1882. Here he obtained a first class honors degrees in Classics in 1884, and graduated as the 16th wrangler in first class mathematical honors in 1885. In 1885 he began studying experimental physics at the Cavendish Laboratory under physicist J.J Thomson, with no practical experience or knowledge of physics. Here he developed his thesis on platinum thermometry and in 1886 he became a Fellow of Trinity. While at Cambridge, he invented a new system of shorthand for writing quickly, which J.J. Thomson learnt and used.  Family & personal life  He married Victoria Mary Stewart, whom he met at Cambridge, in 1894 in England. They had a daughter, Cecil (1895), and three sons, Guy Stewart Callendar (1898), Leslie Hugh (1896) and Maxwell Victor (1905). Guy Stewart proposed the effect of carbon dioxide emissions on the climate, known as 'The Callendar Effect'. One of Callendar‚Äôs interests was motoring. He undertook research on internal combustion engines and purchased a motorcycle in 1902, which he modified and improved himself. In 1904 he purchased and modified a car to use for family travels around England. Hugh's other interests and hobbies included astronomy, nature study, competitive shooting, gymnastics, soccer, tennis, and handicraft, including automotive mechanics. He published a number of works on what he called \\"Cursive Shorthand\\" and wrote on English spelling reform.  Career   Resistance Thermometry  Prior to Callendar‚Äôs work in the area of thermometry, there lacked an instrument for accurate and reliable temperature measurement. The gas thermometer was the standard for temperature scale at the time. These devices had significant limitations regarding their reliability and practicality, as they were costly and large. The mercury thermometer was also used for temperature measurement, although it had a restricted range and was often too fragile for use. At Cavendish Laboratory, Thomson advised Callendar to study metallic resistance thermometry. Werner von Siemens was the first to propose the use of a platinum resistance temperature detector in 1860, although his instrument readings were unstable. Callendar developed an equation for the resistance of metal as a function of temperature, which was accurate to within 1% from 0-600¬∞C. This equation was used to develop a standard scale of temperature, which was later accepted by the Committee on Electrical Standards in 1899 to be used internationally. By 1886 he had developed a design for an accurate platinum resistance thermometer, correcting the errors made by Siemens. The thermometer measured temperatures with accuracy from -190¬∞C to 660¬∞C. His results were praised by J.J Thomson for providing a new tool that ‚Äúcould determine temperatures with an ease and accuracy never obtainable before‚Äù. Callendar improved the heat range of his platinum thermometer from -200¬∞C up to 1000¬∞C. His design underwent vigorous testing at the National Physical Laboratory, which yielded confirmation of the reliability of the thermometer. Callendar‚Äôs platinum thermometer could be used to measure the melting point of metals, allowing it to be used in metal alloying. The apparatus was produced commercially by the Cambridge Instrument Company. The production of modern platinum thermometers were based on Callendar‚Äôs model with the accuracy continually improved on, such as more purified platinum and making them smaller. His work on the platinum resistance thermometer gave way for the development of the rolling-chart thermometer, which permits the measurement of climatic temperature over time. Although there are many other methods for temperature measurement, platinum resistance thermometers continue to be used. They are primarily used as calibrating devices due to their high levels of accuracy and stability over time.  Thermodynamics  Illustration of calorimeter by H.L. CallendarCallendar left Cambridge and spent two years working as a professor of physics at Royal Holloway College from 1891-1893. In 1893 he commenced at McGill University in Montreal, Canada and was assigned to the second Macdonald Chair in Physics. Leslie, Cecil and Guy were born during this time at McGill. While at McGill, Callendar conducted research on two topics in the area of thermodynamics. The first was research on steam engines alongside Professor of Mechanical Engineering John Thomas Nicolson. The second was the study of electrical and thermal units using calorimetry techniques with Howard Turner Barnes. He also studied and published papers on the heat of gases. He calculated a boiling point of sulfur, which was four degrees below the existing accepted value. The boiling point of sulfur on the International Temperature Scale in 1927 and Callendar‚Äôs value only differed by 0.07¬∞C.  Work on steam  Callendar developed a formula for the heat of steam, expressing it as a function of pressure and temperature, publishing it in his first paper on thermodynamics in 1900. He was able to obtain experimental results consistent with his formula on multiple thermodynamic properties. From this he was able to develop tables on the thermodynamic properties of steam for calculations in science and engineering. This was an important contribution, as there lacked a standard accepted set of steam tables. His Callendar Steam Tables were published (1915, 1922, 1927) and also published The Properties of Steam and Thermodynamic Theory of Turbines in 1920. Turbine manufacturers accepted and used Callendar‚Äôs steam tables to invent steam machinery. Callendar and his son participated in the first International Steam Conference was held in 1929, which aimed to resolve inconsistencies between steam tables used globally. After Callendar‚Äôs death the following year, his son Guy Stewart continued to work on steam properties. He published several works on the subject alongside professor Alfred Charles Glyn Egerton.  Work on calorimetry  In 1902, Callendar and Barnes developed the continuous-flow calorimeter, used for measurement of the heat capacity properties of liquids. They used their apparatus to research the comparison of electrical and thermal units, calculating a value for one calorie that compares very closely to the currently accepted value. Callendar‚Äôs continuous-flow calorimeter was further improved on and later used in laboratories for scientific experiments and research. Their apparatus was used widely for the determination of the heat capacity of liquids and gas, as well as study of combustion gases.  Other work  In 1896, Callendar was the first in Canada to perform X-ray experiments. The method produced satisfactory results that could be used for imaging in hospitals. Callendar also did work on fuels later in his career. He contributed to a paper on detonation of fuels, also including nuclear self- ignition, published in 1926. In 1927 he published a further paper on detonation of paraffin fuels.  World War 1  During World War 1 Callendar was a consultant to the Board of Invention and Research (BIR). He worked mostly with the body responsible in charge of detecting and destroying submarines. He was also a member of the Air Inventions Committee (AIC), alongside his son Guy Stewart. Here they performed experiments on equipment and aircraft engines using radiography, locating defects and fractures.  Awards & honours  Callendar was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1894. He was president of the Physical Society of London from 1910-1912. He was made a Commander of the British Empire (C.B.E) in 1920 for his work during World War 1. He received many honours and awards including: * Watt Medal (1898) * Rumford Medal (1906) * Hawksley Gold Medal (1915) * Duddell Medal and Prize (1923) The Institute of Measurement and Control awards The Callendar Medal each year ‚Äúfor outstanding contribution to the art of instruments or measurement‚Äù.

There was a widespread challenge to long-established rules surrounding theatrical representation; resulting in the development of many new forms of theatre, including modernism, Expressionism, Impressionism, political theatre and other forms of Experimental theatre, as well as the continuing development of already established theatrical forms like naturalism and realism. Throughout the century, the artistic reputation of theatre improved after being derided throughout the 19th century. However, the growth of other media, especially film, has resulted in a diminished role within the culture at large. In light of this change, theatrical artists have been forced to seek new ways to engage with society. The various answers offered in response to this have prompted the transformations that make up its modern history.Richard Drain, Preface, Twentieth-Century Theatre: A Sourcebook,\\" Taylor & Francis, 1995. Developments in areas like Gender theory and postmodern philosophy identified and created subjects for the theatre to explore. These sometimes explicitly meta-theatrical performances were meant to confront the audience's perceptions and assumptions in order to raise questions about their society. These challenging and influential plays characterized much of the final two decades of the 20th-century. Although largely developing in Europe and North America through the beginning of the century, the next 50 years saw an embrace of non-Western theatrical forms. Influenced by the dismantling of empires and the continuing development of post-colonial theory, many new artists utilized elements of their own cultures and societies to create a diversified theatre. Realism The original company of the Moscow Art Theatre in 1899 Realism focuses on the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions or implausible, exotic and supernatural elements. For many theatre artists throughout the century, realism was meant to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. Influenced by the ideas of Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin and others, many artists began to find a psychological approach to theatre that emphasized the inner dimensions of the characters onstage. This was carried out both on the stage in acting styles, in play writing and in theatrical design. Beginning with the work Russian playwrights Ivan Turgenev, Alexander Ostrovsky and Leo Tolstoy and continued by Emile Zola in France and Henrik Ibsen in Norway in the late 19th Century, realism came to dominate most of the theatrical culture of the 20th century in Britain and North America. Russia In Russia, the movement towards realism began earlier than anywhere else in the world. Building on the work of earlier pioneers, Constantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko founded the Moscow Art Theatre in 1898, wanting to reform a Russian theatre dominated by melodrama to one in which high-quality art was available to the general public. In perhaps the most important theatrical meeting of the 20th century, the two met for an epic 18-hours, from 2 pm to 8 am the next morning, and laid the foundation for one of the most influential companies of the century.Benedetti, Jean. 1991.

Together they would forge a professional company with an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity, selecting actors from Nemirovich's class at the Philharmonic school and Stanislavsky's amateur Society of Art and Literature group, along with other professional actors; they would create a realistic theatre of international renown, with popular prices for seats, whose organically unified aesthetic would bring together the techniques of the Meiningen Ensemble and those of Andr√© Antoine's Th√©√¢tre Libre (which Stanislavsky had seen during trips to Paris).Benedetti (1989, 18) and (1999, 61‚Äì62) On December 29, 1898, the theatre opened Anton Chekhov's The Seagull with Stanislavski himself playing the role of Trigorin and Vsevolod Meyerhold as Treplev in \\"one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest developments in the history of world drama.\\"Rudnitsky (1981, 8) and Benedetti (1999, 85) Nemirovich described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a dam breaking and the production received unanimous praise from the press.Benedetti (1999, 86). Later analysts attribute the production's success to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time.Braun (1981, 64). Productions of Ibsen, Shakespeare, and Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard and Three Sisters were also very successful in the early days of the company. After the success of the Moscow Art Theatre, Stanislavski set out to create a unified system of acting that would train actors and actresses to create believable characterizations for their performances. Developed mainly between 1911 and 1916 and revised throughout his life, the approach was partly based on the concept of emotional memory for which an actor focuses internally to portray a character's emotions onstage. Areas of study include concentration, voice, physical skills, emotion memory, observation, and dramatic analysis. The Stanislavsky system was widely practiced in the Soviet Union and in the United States, where experiments in its use began in the 1920s and continued in many schools and professional workshops. In the early part of the 20th century, Russia experienced a cultural Silver Age and the theatre was no exception. By 1916, the total number of producing theatres in Moscow alone totaled close to 200. These year-round and seasonal theatres produced mainly farces, comedies, vaudevilles and even melodramas, but there were also a significant number of theatres offering realistic or naturalistic theatre. These included Aleksey Suvorin's Maly Theatre and the Moscow Dramatic Theatre (1914‚Äì19). While there were a number of actress-managers in St. Petersburg and Moscow like Vera Komissarzhevskaya and Ida Rubinstein, the course of Russian theatre in the Silver Age was largely dominated by men.Golub, 278-282. After the First World War and the Russian Revolution, many theatre artists left Russia for other countries, including Georges Pito√´ff to France, Theodore Komisarjevsky to Britain, and, famously, Mikhael Chekhov to the United States, exporting the Stanislavski system and contributing to the development of a 'director's theatre' in the post-war world.Esslin, 379 Eugene O'Neill had a huge influence on the development of modern American drama. United States In the United States, William Vaughn Moody's plays The Great Divide (1906) and The Faith Healer (1909) pointed the way to a more realistic American drama in their emphasis on the emotional conflicts that lie at the heart of contemporary social conflicts. Other key playwrights signaling the move to realism in the beginning of the century include Edward Sheldon, Charles Rann Kennedy and Rachel Crothers. Onstage, the American theatre was dominated by the Barrymore family: Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore (the \\"First Lady of American Theater\\") and John Barrymore (\\"... the most influential and idolized actor of his day.\\"). They were so popular that a play was even written about them: The Royal Family by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, a parody of the Barrymores, with particular aim taken at John and Ethel Barrymore. Through the early century, no American dramatist had as much influence on the development of drama as Eugene O'Neill. Born into the theatre from a young age, he spent much of his youth on trains and backstage at theatres, before developing his talent with the Provincetown Players in New York City. Between 1916 and 1920, he wrote several plays for the company before debuting his first critical hit Beyond the Horizon in 1920, which went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He followed that with critical and commercial successes, including The Emperor Jones, Anna Christie (Pulitzer Prize 1922), Desire Under the Elms (1924), Strange Interlude (Pulitzer Prize 1928), Mourning Becomes Electra (1931), The Iceman Cometh (1939) and his only well-known comedy, Ah, Wilderness!. After his death, his magnum opus and masterwork Long Day's Journey into Night was published and is often regarded to be one of the finest American plays of the 20th century. The economic crisis of the Great Depression led to the creation of the Federal Theatre Project (1935‚Äì39), a New Deal program which funded theatre and other live artistic performances throughout the country. National director Hallie Flanagan shaped the project into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and made it possible for millions of Americans to see theatre for the first time. The project directly employed 15,000 men and women and played 1,200 productions to nearly 30 million people in 200 theatres nationwide, with 65% being presented free of charge, at a total cost of $46 million. Key figures of the early century include George S. Kaufman, George Kelly, Langston Hughes, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard, Robert E. Sherwood, and a set of playwrights who followed O'Neill's path of philosophical searching, Philip Barry, Thornton Wilder and William Saroyan. Modernism Modernism was a predominantly European movement that developed as a self-conscious break from traditional art forms. It represents a significant shift in cultural sensibilities, often attributed to the fallout of World War I.Modris Ekstein, Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, Lester & Orpen Dennys, 2002. At first, the modernist theatre was in large part an attempt to realize the reformed stage on naturalistic principles as advocated by √âmile Zola in the 1880s. However, a simultaneous reaction against naturalism urged the theatre in a much different direction. Owing much to symbolism, the movement attempted to integrate poetry, painting, music, and dance in a harmonious fusion. Both of these seemingly conflicting movements fit under the term 'Modernism'.Drain 3 Political theatre A workshop of Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed in 2008. Political theatre is an attempt to rethink the nature and function of theatre in the light of the dynamics of the society outside it and audience involvement within it. It led to profound and original theories of acting, staging and playwriting.Drain 75. Popular theatre At the beginning of the 20th century, many viewed theatre as an \\"all-too-popular affair.\\"Drain 153 Frequently, the true reformers of the early part of the century called for increasingly smaller theatres, where their techniques could register on a select audience. Still, these same practitioners often dreamed that their art would be a true people's theatre: a theatre for the people. Inspired by an understanding of the Greek theatre and heavily influenced by Nietzsche, they sought a profound or ecstatic ritual event that involved music and movement, in a space without a proscenium arch. Later, practitioners like Vsevolod Meyerhold and Bertolt Brecht would initiate an attempt to bridge the \\"gulf\\" between modernism and the people.Drain 156-157 Musical theatre In popular musical theatre there have been different trends and phases of commercial success, including works of the following: * the great popularity of the British Edwardian musical comedies (1892-1917), * the advent of the Princess Theatre musicals in New York (1913-1923), * the emergence of American popular musical theatre, with the works of: **Jerome Kern (1885-1945); Princess Theatre musicals, Ziegfeld Follies (1916, 1917), Show Boat (1927) ** George Gershwin (1898-1937) and Ira Gershwin (1896-1983) Rhapsody in Blue (1924), An American in Paris (1928), Porgy and Bess (1935). **Cole Porter (1891-1964); Paris (1928), Wake Up and Dream (1929), Anything Goes (1934) **Rodgers and Hart; Richard Rodgers (1902-1979) and Lorenz Hart (1895-1943) Babes in Arms (1937), Pal Joey (1940) **Rodgers and Hammerstein; Richard Rodgers (1902-1979) and Oscar Hammerstein II (1895 - 1960):Oklahoma! (1943), Carousel (1945), South Pacific (1949), The King and I (1951) and The Sound of Music (1959). *In the second half of the 20th century, new creative talents emerged and attracted large audiences, including: ** Stephen Sondheim (1930--); West Side Story (1957) (lyrics), A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962), A Little Night Music (1973), Sweeney Todd (1979), Into the Woods (1987). ** Andrew Lloyd Webber (1948--); Evita (1978), Cats (1981), The Phantom of the Opera (1986) **Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg (1944--) and Alain Boublil (1941--); Les Mis√©rables (musical) (1980), and Miss Saigon (1989) Post-modern theatre Post-modern theatre is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the postmodern philosophy that originated in Europe in the middle of the 20th century. Post-modern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most post-modern productions are centered around highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, post- modern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers. Global theatre At the beginning of the 20th-century, many European audiences were exposed to the \\"exotic\\" theatrical world of Japanese and Chinese performances. This led to many Western practitioners interpreting and incorporating these styles into their own theatres: most notably Bertolt Brecht's adaptation of Chinese opera to support his 'Alienation' effect. The influence of the non-western theatre on theatrical culture in the 20th-century has often been crucial to new developments. However, the period during and after the advent of post-colonial theory in the 1960s and 1970s, has led to a tremendous amount of development in theatre practice all over the world. This has created, for the first time, a truly global theatre.Drain 293 Significant figures Significant figures and some landmark theories and movements of the period include: * Constantin Stanislavski (1863-1938) and his system: a \\"naturalistic\\" method of drawing on the actor's own emotional memories to convey a character's thoughts and emotions * Antonin Artaud (1896-1948) and the Theatre of Cruelty: a plan to force the audience to shed their illusions * Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) and Epic theatre: a reaction against Stanislavski's naturalistic method, Epic theatre makes clear that the audience is watching a play and an artifice * Lee Strasberg (1901-1982) and Method acting: which trains actors to draw upon their own emotions and memories, to convincingly portray a part. * Jerzy Grotowski (1933‚Äì1999), who introduced the concept of \\"poor theatre\\" * Eugenio Barba, Grotowski's disciple and founder of the Odin Theatret, introducing the concepts of theatrical anthropology * Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) and Theatre of the Absurd: in a modern world without meaning or purpose, a play's dialog, plot and characters give up the threads of \\"logic\\" or \\"message\\". (related to Existentialism) * Hans-Thies Lehmann's theory of Postdramatic theatre: focused more on effect on the audience than on the original text. Nobel laureates During the twentieth-century the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the following who were primarily dramatists: * 1904 - Jos√© Echegaray ‚Äî Spanish; El gran Galeoto * 1910 - Paul Heyse ‚Äî German * 1911 - Maurice Maeterlinck ‚Äî Belgian * 1912 - Gerhart Hauptmann ‚Äî German * 1915 - Romain Rolland ‚Äî French * 1922 - Jacinto Benavente ‚Äî Spanish * 1925 - George Bernard Shaw ‚Äî Irish * 1934 - Luigi Pirandello ‚Äî Italian * 1936 - Eugene O'Neill ‚Äî American * 1969 - Samuel Beckett ‚Äî Irish * 1986 - Wole Soyinka ‚Äî Nigerian * 1997 - Dario Fo ‚Äî Italian The 2000 and 2005 Nobel Prizes in Literature were awarded to the playwrights Gao Xingjian and Harold Pinter, respectively, most of whose works were composed in the twentieth century.

Most of the men were members of the 1st Canadian Regiment of the Continental Army, recruited in 1775 by James Livingston in anticipation of an invasion of Quebec. As the expedition failed, they, their families, and the American militias were driven out of Canada. There can be little doubt, however, that Father Farmer on his journeys through Northern New Jersey crossed over into New York and attended to the Catholics there, even venturing into the city itself, where he kept the faith alive.

United Kingdom Following the raids, the terror alert level was raised by Britain's Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre on 10 August 2006 from 'severe' to 'critical', signalling an attack was believed to be imminent. Security at all British airports was raised to the highest level, with all property having to go into the aircraft's hold, except for essentials such as travel documents and wallets. Passengers travelling with small children were permitted to carry baby food but had to taste it in front of staff. On 14 August 2006, the threat level was reduced from 'Critical' to 'Severe'. An announcement was made that the hand baggage rules would shortly be relaxed to permit the carrying of one small item of hand baggage, although the ban on all liquids remained. Hand baggage was reintroduced at some smaller airports on 14 August, but was not permitted at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports until 15 August. Despite having made it clear in August that the security measures were \\"here to stay\\", at the end of September, under pressure from the flight industry and professional musicians, the British government relaxed the size restrictions to the aviation industry standard (56 cm √ó 45 cm √ó 25 cm) and allowed musical instruments as hand luggage. On 6 November 2006 the restrictions were relaxed once again to allow limited volumes of liquids in the cabin. In November 2007, Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly announced that from 8 January 2008, British airports would be able to allow more than one item of hand luggage on board. This was following criticism in October by the shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers, who said that because of the restrictive rules, Heathrow was \\"rapidly becoming a national embarrassment\\". Chief executive of British Airways Willie Walsh was also critical, saying that they are \\"damaging the UK's reputation around the world from a business perspective\\". United States Following the operation, the United States Department of Homeland Security banned all liquids and gels except baby formula and prescription medications in the name of the ticket holder in carry-on luggage on all flights. The DHS level in the United States was raised to 'severe' (red) for all flights from the UK. The terror level for all other domestic or non-British international flights in the United States was raised to High (orange). According to White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, President Bush was aware of the plot by 6 August and approved raising the alert on 9 August. Other countries * Australia ‚Äì Qantas began to implement tighter security checks, which would initially only apply to flights heading to the US and the UK, but Prime Minister John Howard mentioned that it could lead to a permanent ban of certain hand luggage in the near future. * Barbados ‚Äì Plane traffic delays affected many airports across the world including the Grantley Adams International Airport located in Barbados. After immediately instituting a policy of heightened security, the delays have affected many tourists including British Prime Minister Tony Blair's attempts to cut his Caribbean holiday short and return to the United Kingdom. * Belgium ‚Äì The Belgian Federal Police, coordinating its efforts with the British and French governments, increased security on the Eurostar rail line that connects London with Paris and Brussels. * Canada ‚Äì Transport Canada, though unaware of any specific threat, nevertheless restricted all liquid and gel items from hand luggage on departing flights. Exceptions were made for approved baby formula and prescription medication. In addition, all passengers travelling to the United States were subject to having their footwear examined. * Finland ‚Äì Finland's national airline Finnair cancelled two of its flights to London Heathrow on Thursday and one from Heathrow to Helsinki on Sunday, the remaining flights only had slight delays. Other airlines flying to and from Finland have experienced only delays. Passengers are forbidden to carry anything more than personal documents and wallets in flights to Britain. * Hong Kong ‚Äì Airport authority at the Chek Lap Kok airport have advised passengers going to the United States to arrive three hours before their scheduled flight in order to pass through tighter security checks. Hong Kong Government reminds Hongkongers in the United Kingdom to keep abreast of latest developments and pay attention to personal safety. * India ‚Äì Indian airports have been put under high alert and hand-baggage screenings have been tightened. Surveillance has also been stepped up. Incoming flights from the United Kingdom are facing delays due to greater checks. * Ireland ‚Äì The National Civil Aviation Security Committee, which advises the Irish Government, met to review the situation. Irish Minister for Transport Martin Cullen said there is no increased security risk at Irish airports. * Japan ‚Äì Though airport security was not heightened, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways began to strictly prohibit liquid items from its planes. * Netherlands ‚Äì The Dutch government said the UK terror plot would have no effect to the threat level in the country and would remain at \\"substantial\\" and \\"low\\" for Schiphol. * New Zealand ‚Äì Additional security restrictions were placed on passengers departing from New Zealand to the UK, and there were some flight delays; however, none were cancelled. In order to maintain the heightened security, thirty-two extra security staff supported by sniffer dogs were brought in to man three extra security lanes at Auckland Airport. * Norway ‚Äì The Norwegian government will not change the threat level and it remains at Low. * Pakistan ‚Äì The Pakistani government made several arrests in response to the plot. Foreign Office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam stated, \\"In fact, Pakistan played a very important role in uncovering and breaking this international terrorist network\\". * Philippines ‚Äì Authorities at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport have placed its airports on heightened alert. NAIA representatives have stated that all U.S.-bound flights have prohibited passengers from bringing liquid items on board. * South Korea ‚Äì The government has put Incheon International Airport on heightened alert following the foiled terrorist plot. All passengers are undergoing additional screening and all U.S.- and UK-bound flights are prohibited from carrying any liquids on flights. Furthermore, passengers en route to the US will have their belongings searched before boarding their flight. Korea's Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the Ministry of Construction and Transportation raised the security level from green (ordinary) to blue (concerned) and then to yellow (caution). A yellow alert indicates intelligence suggesting a threat to aviation. * Republic of China (Taiwan) ‚Äì Taipei heightened security measures on U.S.- and UK-bound flights. All ROC airlines banned UK- and U.S.-bound passengers from taking \\"large carry-on luggage\\" on board. Liquids also had to be checked in, not carried on board. Hand luggage restrictions United Kingdom Passengers travelling from and through all other UK airports were temporarily only permitted to carry-on those items on a restricted list, and these items had to be carried in transparent plastic bags. No liquids could be carried on board. Liquid medications, such as insulin for diabetics, were banned, \\"unless verified as authentic.\\" All laptops, mobile phones, digital audio players and other electronic items were also banned. It was suggested in The Times that the restrictions on hand baggage would be \\"enforced pending a decision from the National Aviation Security Committee following which they may be made permanent.\\" This was confirmed by sources close to Douglas Alexander, the Secretary of State for Transport, on BBC News. On 14 August 2006, an announcement was made that the restrictions on hand baggage for flights originating in the UK would shortly be liberalised to permit carriage of one small (45 cm √ó 35 cm √ó 16 cm) piece of hand baggage per person. Whilst electronics, books, and other dry items were again permitted on flights leaving the UK, all liquids above 100ml remained banned in hand luggage. On 2 November 2014, liquid restriction rules were eased.Cobalt Light Systems test technology for liquid explosives However, as of current, some airports, including Stansted Airport and Manchester Airport, have added another restriction for travel bottle kits, stating that the bottle capacity must be printed or embossed on the bottles, with measurements on handwritten and sticker labels deemed insufficient and outright inadmissible to security.Stansted Airport Security Guide United States Similar emergency restrictions were placed on airline passengers traveling within and from the United States. Initially, all liquids were forbidden, including beverages, hair gels, toothpaste, lipstick, sunscreen, and hand lotions, due to the suspicion that liquid chemicals were planned to be used in the attacks. Electronic devices (iPods, laptops, etc.) were still allowed for domestic flights. 3-1-1 for carry-ons As of 26 September 2006, the Transportation Security Administration adjusted the ban on liquids, aerosols and gels. Travellers are permitted to carry liquids through security checkpoints in containers of 3.4 ounces (100 mL) or less that fit comfortably in one quart-size clear plastic zip-top bag. This procedure came to be known as \\"3-1-1 for carry-ons\\" (3.4 ounce containers in a 1 quart bag, 1 bag per passenger). Items purchased in the airside zone after clearing security could be brought on board without restriction. Other exemptions to this restriction include medications and breast milk. European Union On 10 October 2006 a European Union Regulation placed restrictions on carrying liquid materials in hand luggage across the EU. This restriction was eased on 2 November 2014 with new RapidScan liquid explosive detectors.EU abandoned plan to end liquid curbs in air travel in 2013 Japan On 1 March 2007, The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport also set out new regulations concerning the carriage of liquids in carry-on luggage for international flights. Passengers travelling abroad from Japan are required to place liquids less than 100ml into a transparent resealable bag not exceeding 20 cm √ó 20 cm. Any liquids over 100ml are forbidden. Singapore On 8 May 2007, Singapore introduced new liquid restrictions, which is limited to 100ml for all flights (excluding Seletar Airport), where Changi Airport is the biggest airport with more frequent visitors and direct services. Liquids less than 100ml must be sealed into transparent resealable bag not exceeding 20 cm x 20 cm. This restriction was eased on 2 November 2014. Other Countries Subsequently, similar restrictions for liquids in carry on luggage were set out in many other countries worldwide including Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam and China who all set out liquid restrictions on international flights. Impact Overall, an estimated 400,000 passengers were affected because of the alerts. It has been estimated that the first day of delays cost the airlines over ¬£175 million. As many as 20,000 bags are believed to have been misplaced at Heathrow in the days following the flight cancellations. Flight cancellations  Some inbound flights to London Heathrow Airport were cancelled on the day of the arrests, most notably the Thursday short-haul flights of British Airways. Some flights to and from London Gatwick Airport were also suspended, Tents on the car park in front of terminal 4. Heathrow, 14 August On Sunday 13 August 30% of flights out of Heathrow were cancelled to reduce pressure on the screeners. By 15 August flight cancellations had fallen to 47 flights at Heathrow, and 8 Ryanair flights from Stansted. It was anticipated that cancellations would reduce on 16 August, with 90% of flights expected to depart as scheduled. Controversy over the alert On 12 August a public argument broke out between BAA, the operator of Heathrow and other airports, and British Airways, with Willie Walsh, BA's Chief Executive, accusing BAA of not being able to cope with the increased security and baggage checks. Ryanair also called on the British government to employ police and military reservists to speed up the full body searches which were now mandated, with Chief Executive Michael O'Leary saying: On 18 August Ryanair's O'Leary delivered an ultimatum to the British government demanding the resumption of normal hand baggage dimensions and hand screening one passenger in four instead of one in two within one week, otherwise Ryanair would sue the Government for compensation under section 93 of the Transport Act 2000. The government responded that the actions were taken under the Aviation Security Act 1982, and no compensation was payable. Several pilots complained about the \\"ridiculous\\" luggage restrictions that was thought up by \\"utter morons\\", the Sunday Herald reported. Carolyn Evans, head of flight safety at the British Airline Pilots Association, said, \\"the procedures put in place are not sustainable long term, and unless the passengers are treated more reasonably we will not have an industry left\\".Are we really at risk from snacks on a plane?, Sunday Herald, 20 August 2006 Economic effects The Times commented the day after the arrests, that the economic effects were minor and that the FTSE 100 index showed only \\"mild signs of strain\\", suggesting that terror was already priced into assets, that the market impact will be contained, and that \\"what is lost on the swings may be gained on the roundabouts\\". It observed that the real commercial risk is that \\"people's behaviour is altered... change may come so subtly and subconsciously that it is hard to see, let alone measure‚Ä¶ people may stop travelling for example, not because they are scared of being blown up, but because they are tired of complying with necessary security measures.\\" Estimates have also been made of the cost to airlines of their disrupted business. British Airways had to cancel 1280 flights, at a cost of ¬£40 million. Ryanair had to cancel 500 flights, and are suing the UK government for the ¬£3.3 million the cancellations cost them. Easyjet had to cancel 469 flights, at a cost of about ¬£4 million. BAA says the alert cost them ¬£13 million. BA is considering making a claim for compensation against BAA, which operates Heathrow, for its failure to provide adequate security services and shortages of personnel during the crisis. The Civil Aviation Authority has just commenced its five-yearly review of operation of the airport, and it is likely that BAA's ability to handle the security alert will now become part of that review. The combined airline losses may have totalled ¬£250 million. Air passengers also switched to other means of travel. Sea France ferry company operating from Dover to Calais announced that it had beaten its all-time record for number of passengers carried in one week, while Eurostar found that at the peak of the alert it was receiving 10 bookings per minute for immediate travel. Other consequences * BAA advised passengers not to travel to Heathrow unless their journey was \\"essential\\", and long delays were expected for outbound passengers. * Houses in and around Walton Drive in High Wycombe, where one house was raided, were evacuated.

The series was originally published by Del Rey and then re- released by Orbit. More than 10 million books have been sold in the series worldwide.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sten-Number-1-Chris-Bunch/dp/1841490075 Plot overview The books follow Karl Sten, a young man born and raised on the dangerous factory world of Vulcan and saved from life as an outlaw by the head of Imperial Intelligence, Ian Mahoney. Mahoney takes Sten from the terrible world of his birth and enlists him in the military. Sten is thrust into a world of espionage, covert military actions, and galactic politics. His original training is in the super-secret covert ops group known as Mantis. The missions and actions taken are usually known only to a select few. A series of crucial missions ensures that Sten rises swiftly in rank until he becomes a troubleshooter and friend to the Emperor himself. The series of eight books are set three thousand years in the future. A vast empire, limited only by the galaxy itself, is ruled by the Eternal Emperor, a man who appears to be in his thirties but is in fact over three thousand years old. He has mastered death in a way no one has guessed since the beginning of his rule. The source of his power is a powerful fuel called Anti-Matter Two (AM2). It is what fuels everything from the star ships that link the Empire, to industrial factories, to camping heaters. Only he controls its supply and price. And only he knows where to find it. It is only for this reason that he is able to rule.

They also explain, that they wrote the book as a response to the trend of other science fiction authors to pick monarchy as the future form of government in their books. To make the point that monarchy is not a viable form of government, they chose to write about a working-class hero, and incorporated the theme of \\"power corrupts\\".

Pioneer settlers came to this area as early as the 1850s. Local tradition states that the Greenwood and Hart families were among the first settlers in the area, and that the community was named for the Greenwood family and the Creek for the Hart family. As the town of Greenwood began to grow, businesses, churches, a cemetery, school, and masonic lodge were established. A Post Office was opened in 1877, and a town well was dug by John Karr Berry in the early 1890s. At its peak, the town boasted two saloons, four grocery stores, two drug stores, a hotel, bank, hardware store, barber shop, blacksmith shop, cotton gin, and the Greenwood Gazette Newspaper, the Greenwood Male and Female College, although in operation for less than twenty years, provided quality education for the young people of the community. This small settlement has served as a supply center for surrounding farming communities for over one hundred years. It has also been a center of social and religious activities.

It was intended to break the world land speed record, but never made the attempt, the project having been overtaken by the outbreak of World War II.  Background  World-renowned German auto racer Hans Stuck's pet project was to take the world land speed record and he convinced Mercedes-Benz to build a special racing car for the attempt. Officially sanctioned by Adolf Hitler (a race car fan influenced by Stuck), the project was started in 1937, while the Nazi Third Reich was at the height of its powers. Automotive designer Dr Ferdinand Porsche first targeted a speed of , but after George Eyston's and John Cobb's successful LSR runs of 1938 and 1939 the target speed was raised to . By late 1939, when the project was finished, the target speed was a much higher . This would also be the first attempt at the absolute land speed record on German soil, Hitler envisioned the T80 as another propaganda triumph of German technological superiority to be witnessed by all the world, courtesy of German television. The same Autobahn course had already been proven ideal for record-breaking in smaller capacity classes, Britain's Goldie Gardner having exceeded there in a 1,500 cc MG.  Power  The massive 44.5 litre Daimler-Benz DB 603 inverted V12 was selected to power the record-setting car. The engine was an increased displacement derivative of the famous DB-601 aircraft engine that powered the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter in production at the time, with the DB 603 ending up as the largest displacement inverted V12 aviation engine in production for Germany during the World War II years. The DB-603 fitted was just the third prototype (V3) engine of this variant and tuned up to , roughly twice the power of the Bf 109 or the Supermarine Spitfire. The engine ran on a special mixture of methyl alcohol (63%), benzene (16%), ethanol (12%), acetone (4.4%), nitrobenzene (2.2%), avgas (2%), and ether (0.4%) with MW (methanol-water) injection for charge cooling and as an anti-detonant.  Construction  The difficulty of the challenge was met with money and engineering genius. By 1939, the T80 was fully completed at a cost of RM 600,000. The car was over long, had three axles with two of them driven, weighed over 2.7 metric tons (three short tons), and produced together with the aerodynamics of specialist Josef Mickl to attain a projected speed of . Aerodynamically, the T80 incorporated a Porsche-designed enclosed cockpit, low sloping bonnet, rounded wings, and elongated tail booms. Midway down the body were two small wings to provide downforce and ensure stability - these wings were inspired by the wings of Opel's famous rocket cars from 1928. The heavily streamlined twin- tailed body (forming the fairings for each pair of tandem rear wheels) achieved a drag coefficient of 0.18, an astonishingly low figure for any vehicle.  Projections for the 1940 land speed record attempt  As ambitiously planned, Hans Stuck would have driven the T80 over a special stretch of the Reichsautobahn Berlin ‚Äî Halle/Leipzig, which passed south of Dessau (now part of the modern A9 Autobahn) between the modern A9 freeway's exits 11 and 12, which was wide and almost long with the median paved over as the Dessauer Rennstrecke (Dessau racetrack). The date was set for the January 1940 \\"RekordWoche\\" (Record Week), but the war begun on September 1, 1939 prevented the T80 run. In 1939, the vehicle had been unofficially nicknamed Schwarzer Vogel (Black Bird) by Hitler and was to be painted in German nationalistic colours, complete with German Adler (Eagle) and Hakenkreuz (Swastika), but the event was cancelled and the T80 garaged.  War and after the war  The DB 603 aircraft engine was subsequently removed during the war while the vehicle was moved to safety and storage in K√§rnten, Austria. The T80 survived the war and was eventually moved into the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart for permanent display. After the war, John Cobb drove the Railton Mobil Special to a land speed record of in 1947, a speed which was slower than the projected for the T80 in 1940. It took until 1964 for Art Arfons to hit in the turbojet-powered \\"Green Monster\\" to attain and surpass the T80's speed target, purely on the jet thrust for the Arfons vehicle. The wheel-driven record of was set by the four-Chrysler Hemi-engined Goldenrod car in 1965; this is still the piston-engined land speed record for non-supercharged, wheel-driven cars. Since the DB 603 engine possessed a mechanically-driven centrifugal supercharger in its normal form (and as used in the T80), the T80 would have been classed differently from the Goldenrod. No wheel-driven land speed record vehicle exceeded the T80's maximum design velocity until 2001, when Don Vesco's turboshaft-powered \\"Turbinator\\" attained at Bonneville.  Current status  The T80 is currently on display at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt.

It had a population of approximately 150 in 2000. History The small town of Huckabay was founded in the late eighteen hundreds. Gerldine Griswold wrote of how the community was started by John A. Huckabay, Ben Fincher, John and W.C. Copeland, John Gentry, Abe Metsgar, John W. Jones and others who were moving west from Arkansas and Tennessee. The head of the Bosque was the area where they settled which was known as \\"Flatwoods,\\" but was changed to Huckabay, when John Huckabay established a post office. One hundred and sixty acres was claimed by each of the families, which was where they built their homes. After the settlers had wells dug and their homes built, churches, schools and other public buildings began to go up. Ryan Patrick Huckabay is the current mayor of Huckabay. The Historic Businesses of Huckabay The families that started settling the land now known as Huckabay worked hard to build buildings and dig wells. A smoke house and a storm cellar were the first two buildings to go up. The smoke house was where the citizens put fresh meat to begin curing. The storm cellar was a place of storage for fresh fruits and vegetables and protection for families. In the late 1870s, the community began to expand. With the purchase of a gin by Bill Rigsby in 1879, cotton was what supported the town until the peanut production took over for a short period of time. When peanut production decreased, the dairy industry took over. The milk production in this area still remains important to the community. The first store was opened by G.W. Glenn in 1878. The main economic base for Huckabay has changed many times. Over time, the community grew to the point, it had general merchants, drug stores, grocery stores, blacksmith shops, and a well-equipped gin. These businesses were located along the main street of Huckabay. The town did establish the West Texas State Bank at one time but it did not survive. Over time, the community has disintegrated to only a school, two churches and a few antique houses. In 1975 a historical marker was placed on FM 219 to preserve the memory of the small community. The Past Congregations of Huckabay, Texas Huckabay, being a small community, did not have many churches. The Church of Christ was an early church that was built in 1876. The community also had two other churches, the Baptist Church and the Methodist Church, both which were organized in 1881. John Haven organized the Methodist while Joe Lockhart the Baptist. Three acres, only costing one hundred dollars, was purchased in 1910 in order to build a tabernacle. The tabernacle was used for various community and religious activities. Although it is over ninety years old, it still stands today. The antique structure is used for annual Huckabay Homecoming Reunions and many other school and community affairs. Today, Huckabay still has two community churches that hold services regularly. The Huckabay Baptist Church is located a few hundred yards down from the tabernacle, and The Huckabay Church of Christ is located up the hill from the tabernacle a few hundred yards.

First used in 1978, it now runs on Lines 7, 8, and 13. Unlike previous models, the MF 77 was designed for travel into the immediate suburbs of Paris, and as a result has a maximum speed of which has yet to be fully utilized. In addition, it sports a new, curved silhouette with a wider midsection. Its original exterior colors, blue and white, led passengers to refer to it as \\"le m√©tro blanc,\\" or white metro. History Replacing the Sprague In the early 1970s, upon the completion of the MF 67 delivery, at the time the newest steel-wheeled trains on the M√©tro, many technological advances in braking and traction caused the RATP, which oversees operations of the Parisian public transport network, to examine the possibilities for new steel, rather than rubber, wheeled trains to replace the aging Sprague-Thomson fleet. Thus, the RATP commissioned a consortium of companies including Alstom, CEM, Creusot-Loire, and Jeumont Schneider, to design a new addition to the M√©tro's rolling stock, the MF 77. The RATP's goal at the time of commission was for 1,000 cars, 600 of which to contain engines for 200 five-car sets. Later, the order was reduced to 187 sets for a total for 935 cars. The first trains were delivered in the summer of 1978 and entered passenger service on 26 September that year on Line 13, whose MF 67 trains were transferred to Line 8. A second order of ten sets was contracted on 4 February 1983, released in 1985 and 1986. The trains on Line 13 recently underwent their mid-life refurbishment, which included a new interior configuration, updated destination signage, lighting and mechanical improvements. However, the RATP was largely dissatisfied with the refurbishment of the Line 13 trains, citing problems with the contractor that handled the work, as well as defects in the workmanship. Though it is expected that the trains on Line 8 will be refurbished next, followed by the trains on Line 7, the RATP will explore other avenues to carry out the work, even if it means that the refurbishment is done on a lesser scale (similar to that of the refurbishment of the MF 67 on Lines 10 and 12). As of January 2019, trains on the 7 & 8 are undergoing renovation, but on a lesser scale to that of trains on the 13. While seating on board the trains are extremely similar, noticeable differences between the two projects include: * Keeping the 2X2 (2 forward-facing seats per side) configuration in the middle of each car, instead of going to the 2X1 (alternating 2 forward-facing seats on one side & 1 forward facing seat on the opposing side) configuration seen on the 13. The ends of each car have been fitted with longitudinal seating as their counterparts on the 13 were. * Retaining the ceiling lighting panels, grates, & other components as opposed to replacing them completely. * Retaining elements such as handlebars & static strip maps. Some new handlebars were added to each car however. * Not installing automated announcements, unlike their counterparts on the 13 that are equipped with such announcements, as well as electronic strip maps. Additionally, renovated trains on the 7 & 8 will sport the new joint RATP/√éle-de-France Mobilit√©s (formerly known as STIF) blue/white livery.

The design makes use of proven components, such as the L7 gun of the Centurion, the Leyland L60 multi-fuel engine, the transmission and fire control system of the Chieftain. Many tanks were also built by India under licence as the Vijayanta. Design and development The Vickers MBT followed on from a 24-tonne 20-pdr gunned tank design intended for export.Ogorkiewicz, R M (1973). Vickers Battle Tank, Profile Publications, August 1973. This would be as well equipped as a Centurion but substantially cheaper and with Vickers Vigilant missiles as effective. However, with the appearance of the 105 mm L7 gun into the British, US and German tank designs, this light tank would have been less powerful while too large for the reconnaissance role, and so a new design was required. With armour twice that of the light tank design, it would still be 12 tonnes lighter than Centurion and hence more mobile. The design would use the new engine and transmission of the Chieftain tank then being developed. The development coincided with an agreement with India in 1961 to produce a tank design and help set up a factory there to produce it. The Vickers MBT Mk 1 was designed to be a simple, low-cost, but effective tank. The first prototype was completed in 1963. In 1964, one of the prototypes was sent to India. The Vickers was made of welded rolled homogeneous armour plates. It weighed 38,600 kg, carried a 105 mm gun with 44 rounds and had a top speed of 48 km/h. 70 tanks were sold to Kuwait and many of a modified version were made in India where the tank was called Vijayanta.  Vickers MBT Mark 1(i)  Fitted with a General Motors Detroit Diesel 12V-71T engine, a thermal sleeve for the gun (L7A1 gun redesignated L7A2) and improved optics. Versions Vickers Main Battle Tank Mark 2 The 1968 proposal for a vehicle specification that differed from the Mark 1 in the following respects: #Transistorised gun- control equipment. #New turret of cast front and mantlet-less design, with new gun mounting. #Improved frontal aspect to the hull and turret. #Improved track, suitable for continuously. #Reduced ground pressure due to reduced total weight, increased track width and increased track on the ground by moving two (or three) rear wheel stations backwards (made possible by the change to a General Motors engine). #Engine delivering full horsepower as for the Chieftain through redesigned final drives to give 56+ km/h (made possible by the General Motors engine's potential for uprating). #Improved commander cupola to take the Chieftain vision devices. #Provision for fitting four Swingfire wire-controlled anti-tank missiles (intended as a response to weapons of greater range, such as the 120 mm L11 tank gun. The Mark 2 did not proceed beyond a mock-up although a Vickers Mark 1 MBT with four Swingfire missiles, two mounted either side of the turret towards the rear, was shown at Farnborough. A note in Vickers's files dated from 20 November 1970 explains the probable reason: \\"Guided missiles have an inherent disadvantage in that is almost impossible to fire them from under armour since the rocket motor efflux presents a serious problem. Generally speaking, the best that can be achieved is to put the crew under armour and mount the missiles externally. This presents reloading problems and leaves the missiles vulnerable to small arms and mortar fire.\\" In any case, only four spare missile rounds could be carried. Vickers Main Battle Tank Mark 3 The Mk. 3 retains most of the proposed features of the Mk. 2. Others were the provision for infrared/white- light searchlights and the abandonment of flotation gear. A laser rangefinder of the type being fitted to the Chieftain was also proposed since the range of the L7A1 105 mm gun was well beyond that of the 12.7 mm ranging machine gun fitted. Some thought was also given the idea of mounting the heavier British L11 120 mm gun on the Vickers tank, but this was abandoned because the 105 mm L7-series rifled gun was becoming the NATO standard, 120 mm ammunition was more expensive than 105 mm and was used only by the British Army in Europe, and the weight advantage of the Vicker's tank would be reduced. The Mark 3 differs from the Mark 1 mainly in having a turret with well-shaped cast front welded to a fabricated armour plate body. It also has a cast gun mantlet which is better shaped from the point of view of its resistance to armour-piercing projectiles than the flat mantlet of the Mark. 1. A distinctive additional feature of the Mk. 3 turret is the fitting of a commander's contra-rotating cupola. This was not used on the Mk. 1 supplied to India (Vijayanta) in order to keep the overall height of the tank within a fixed limit. The cupola of the Mk. 3 has 360 degree hand traverse and is fitted with one sight periscope with a magnification of √ó1 and √ó10, and six periscopes for all-around observation. The first production order for Mk. 3 tanks was placed in 1977 by the Government of Kenya. In addition the Mark 3 embodied various other improvements, such as an increase in the depression of its gun from -7¬∞ to -10¬∞ below the horizontal and an increase in the ammunition stowage to 50 rounds. Introduced in 1975, the Mk. 3 has been supplied to Kenya between 1977 and 1981 also have a Pilkington PE Condor combined day/night sight. The gunner has a Barr & Stroud TLS (Tank Laser Sight) with a magnification of √ó1 and √ó10, which is also provided with a ballistic graticule. Mk. 3s for the Nigerian Army, for which production began in 1981, are also fitted with a Vickers Instruments L23Jane's Armour and Artillery 2003‚Äì2004 gunner's laser rangefinder incorporating a Simrad LV352 laser.

It features an improved protection against shaped charge warheads by adding a Royal Ordnance ROMOR-A explosive reactive armour or the or Vickers Defence Systems VARMA Series 2 explosive reactive on the forward portions of the hull and turret. In addition, the Mark 3M gunner's station features a day/thermal sight (the Avimo NVL 3200 or Thales Optronics Falcon), with a remote display for the commander. In April 1997, Vickers selected the Officine Galileo modular day/night panoramic periscopic for installation on the Mark 3M. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and the Avimo LIRD-2 laser warning system (linked to the smoke grenade dischargers) are also part of the Mark 3(M) package. Vickers Main Battle Tank Mark 4 (Valiant) In 1977, Vickers produced a design for a vehicle that incorporated Chobham composite armour protection within a battle weight of 43 tonnes. This first prototype, designated the Vickers Main Battle Tank Mark 4. Vickers Main Battle Tank Mark 7 The Vickers Mk 7 consisted of a third generation Vickers Valiant turret mounted on a Krauss-Maffei-supplied chassis that in the prototype is essentially that of the Leopard 2 MBT. The tank had a Marconi digital fire control system, an SFIM panoramic sight and a Philips 2nd Gen thermal imager.International Defence Equipment Catalogue 1988‚Äì1989 Volume II The Mark 7 has three features that reduces the likelihood of its detection by night sights and other heat-sensing devices. These are its coat of infra-red reflective paint; the mixing of the hot exhaust gases with the cooling air before discharge; and a new design of thermal sleeve.

Her best known songs were \\"Trapped by a Thing Called Love\\" and \\"Down Home Blues\\". Early life LaSalle was born near Sidon, Mississippi,Mississippi Blues Trail website, Msbluestrail.org; accessed June 23, 2014. as the youngest of eight children, to Nathaniel A. Allen Sr. and Nancy Cooper. Her family worked as sharecroppers, and she had to pick cotton and take up other paid labor to support her family. She was raised in Belzoni from age seven and sang in church choirs for local gospel groups around Leflore County. At age 13, she moved to Chicago to live with her oldest brother.  Career  She sat in with R&B; musicians and wrote songs, influenced by country music as well as the blues. Around 1963, while she was working as barmaid at the Mix's Lounge, she met Billy \\"The Kid\\" Emerson, who at that time was working for Chess Records. This resulted in a one year recording contract with Chess; however, no recording sessions were done. Later on Emerson started his own label, Tarpon, and in 1967 he recorded LaSalle on his label. The single, \\"A Love Reputation\\", was a modest regional hit.Profile, Oldies.com; accessed June 23, 2014. She established an independent production company, Crajon, with her then husband Bill Jones. Her song \\"Trapped By a Thing Called Love\\" (1971) was released on Detroit-based Westbound Records. This reached #1 on the national R&B; chart and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song ranked at #85 on the 1971 year-end chart. A RIAA gold disc award was made on November 30, 1971 for a million sales. Reviewing her 1972 debut album of the same name, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"LaSalle seems to be a songwriter first and a singer second, which may be why there's a certain professional anonymity about her unusual moods. But the voice is there‚Äîsensual, warm, even wise, ideal for [producer] Willie Mitchell's meditative Memphis funk. And because she's a pretty good songwriter, just about every one of these twelve tracks offers its professional pleasures. She also wrote successful follow- ups, \\"Now Run and Tell That\\" and \\"Man Sized Job\\", which made #3 and number 4 in the R&B; Top Ten and also charted in the Hot 100. Her early hits were recorded at the Hi recording studios in Memphis, operated by Mitchell, using the best southern session players. She continued to have hits and made three albums on the Westbound label. At 1976 she moved to Jackson and signed a contract with ABC Records. On ABC she had another hit, \\"Love Me Right\\" (#10 R&B;, #80 pop). ABC was taken over by MCA, and LaSalle made three albums for MCA. She also continued to perform live and to produce. Her co-penned song \\"Married, But Not to Each Other\\" was included on the 1979 compilation album The Best of Barbara Mandrell. In 1982 LaSalle signed as songwriter for the Malaco label, where she wrote songs for Z.Z. Hill among others. Jefferson Magazine no 135 http://www.jeffersonbluesmag.com She was then persuaded to also record herself; this resulted in the album \\"Lady In The Street\\" in 1983. She continued to record for Malaco for 15 years, and released a string of critically acclaimed albums, starting with Lady in the Street (1983) and Right Place, Right Time (1984). Her R&B;, soul blues, and soul songs were played on urban radio stations in southern states. In 1985, she enjoyed her only recognition in the UK Singles Chart when her cover version of Rockin' Sidney's \\"My Toot Toot\\" reached #6. She appeared at the 1984 and 1993 versions of the Long Beach Blues Festival. In 1993, she also performed at the San Francisco Blues Festival. Her album, Smokin' In Bed (1997), sold well. LaSalle has in interviews stated that during the Westbound and ABC/MCA years she was free to record any song she liked, but at Malaco she was more limited. Malaco was a blues label, and wanted her to record mainly 'hard blues'. After the Malaco years, LaSalle started her own label Ordena, and released a few albums, including God‚Äôs Got My Back which is a gospel album, and This Real Woman (2-CD set) which is a mixture of everything, it includes country, R&B;, blues and pop. In 2002 LaSalle was again recording for a new label, this time for Ecko Records, a small Memphis-based soul-blues label, the first album was Still the Queen. After more than a decade away, she returned to Malaco to release an album in 2010, titled 24 Hour Woman. In 2011, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. LaSalle lived with her husband, James E. Wolfe, in Jackson, Tennessee, where she opened a restaurant called Blues Legend Caf√©. The restaurant was located at 436 E. Main Street, but has since closed. Personal life and death Her first marriage was to Bill Jones in 1969; they divorced in 1974. Both of them collaborated in producing records, and they went on to establish an independent production company, Crajon Records. In 1977, she married James E. ‚ÄúSuper Wolfe‚Äù Wolfe Jr. He was a disc jockey at that time, later on he ran several radio stations, and became a preacher. LaSalle had two children. After suffering from heart problems, and with complications from a fall having resulted in her right leg being amputated in October 2017, LaSalle died surrounded by her family, at the age of 78, on January 8, 2018.  Legacy  In 2009, LaSalle was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Belzoni. In 2013 and 2014, LaSalle was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the 'Soul Blues Female Artist' category. On June 6, 2015, LaSalle was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Denise LaSalle among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

She became known as \\"Britain's Most Wanted Woman\\" during a major police and media hunt for her in connection with allegations of corporate fraud. The chase lasted for three years and covered a large area of Europe - including the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Gibraltar, and Portugal. She was featured on BBC TV Crimewatch and ITV, and newspapers printed various accounts of her possible whereabouts during a three-year period. She and Graham Hesketh, her partner in flight, were frequently likened to Bonnie and Clyde. Mont always maintained her innocence. Despite the investigative reporting of the UK press, her whereabouts were unknown throughout the entire period. A Guardian article, in September 2004, alleged she was living in a caravan near Brighton. Early life Mont is the daughter of Neville Mont, who was an Under Sheriff of Sussex, and Joan Mont, a former Conservative leader of East Sussex County Council. She attended secondary school at St. Mary's Hall, Brighton and later attended school in Canada where she lived with relatives during 1986. On her return from Canada, she acquired a job with the Gemini Business Centre. Arrest and flight In September 1999 she was arrested. The officer leading the case was Detective Constable Stephen Skerrett of the Steyning Station of Sussex Police. Later, her car was found near Beachy Head (an infamous suicide spot). The Coast Guard mounted a two-day search operation before Mont's mother eventually admitted to receiving a phone call from her. It was reported that she had fled the country in a light aircraft piloted by Graham Hesketh from Shoreham Airport. She denied the allegations against her via a website. Mont was featured on BBC television's Crimewatch in 2000 as wanted for questioning in relation to allegations of ¬£300,000 of computer fraud, which she has always denied. She later appeared the same year in an ITV production similar to Crimewatch entitled \\"Britain's Most Wanted\\": in this programme, DC Skerrett, also a pilot, flew an aircraft for the reconstruction of events. The following day, the tabloids adopted the title of the programme as a nickname for Mont. Mont and Hesketh settled in Spain and lived in a small caravan. Hesketh worked as a bricklayer and the couple had their first child, Samantha, in 2001. Claims were made in the media that she had set up a website to taunt police and that she had sent emails saying 'Catch me if you can'. She has always denied these allegations.  Capture and escape  The couple remained at large in Spain until January 2002, when Mont was arrested on the Costa del Sol. She was taken to Madrid to await extradition proceedings, but when the Spanish authorities released her on bail, she vanished again. The Guardian reported in 2004 that the couple's son, Benjamin, was born at Worthing hospital in late 2003, and that since Skerrett's departure from the police force much of the interest in closing the file on the fraud has gone. The case against Mont was eventually dropped - a joint decision by the Police and Crown Prosecution Service, according to a spokesman for the force. Lawsuits Graham Hesketh complained to the Press Complaints Commission about the behaviour of the Sunday Mirror.

It is located 67 kilometers from the provincial capital city of Salamanca and has a population of 2.700 people. The municipality is made up of two entities: Majuges at 3 km and Vitigudino, which is the head. In addition, the region has 56 municipalities. Geography The municipality covers an area of 52 km¬≤. It lies 769 meters above sea level and the post code is 37210. Culture Festivals There are several festivals in this town, but the most important are: \\"Los Corpus\\" and \\"Ferias\\". Los Corpus These festivities begin on Wednesday, with an incipient \\"chupinazo\\" in the Plaza de Espa√±a, followed at midnight by a capea-verbena that takes place in the bullring. The main day that gives rise to the festivities is the traditional Corpus Thursday, in which a Solemn Mass is celebrated with a subsequent procession with the Blessed Sacrament under a canopy through the main streets of the municipality. The streets are adorned with thyme and altars in which the blessing with the monstrance is prayed and imparted, while the Blessed Jesus is incense and flower petals are thrown.In the afternoon there is a costume contest, in which the People take the center of town until, at night, a confinement takes place. Friday and Saturday they have a very similar program, traditional running of the bulls at noon (also with carts for children), cape in the afternoon in the bullring and dance in the Plaza de Espa√±a at night, all accompanied by brass bands, the boot wine, good food and the colorful atmosphere provided by the many friends' clubs. It is noteworthy that some years (although less and less) in the evening capeas the traditional \\"charlotada\\" is performed in which a pe√±a or group of friends dressed up with a specific theme and with all the possible props enters the bullring where then they take out a heifer for everyone to enjoy. On Sunday the religious festival is repeated, in communion with the whole Church, in addition to a confinement that puts an end to all celebrations. Ferias On August 15, the dedication of the Virgen del Socorro, whose image is venerated in a hermitage on a high part of the town, is especially celebrated on August 15. Previously, the image has been taken to the parish church where the Novena will be celebrated (9 days of preparation) and on the day of the feast, solemn Mass is celebrated and subsequent procession to the hermitage. Numerous women and girls accompany the Virgin with the traditional charro costume or with a mantilla. Already in the hermitage a floral offering is made. Also famous are the colorful parade of floats that same day 15 at night, and the immemorial cattle market that takes place on the 16th. In addition, on those days some bullfighting is usually celebrated, as well as festivals.

He was a leading exemplar of the interaction between the philosophies and ethics of Hinduism and Christianity, about which he wrote in his book, The Oriental Christ. Life and work Sen and his colleagues agreed that four Brahmos would study and report on the relationship between Brahmo ideals and the four major world religions (Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism and Islam). Gour Govinda Ray was deputed to examine Hinduism; Aghore Nath Gupta, Buddhism and Girish Chandra Sen, Islam. Mozoomdar was deputed to study Christianity. His resulting book, The Oriental Christ, was published by Geo. H. Ellis in Boston in 1883.Suresh Chunder Bose (1929). The Life of Protap Chunder Mozoomdar (Vol. 2). Calcutta: Nababidhan Press, p. 105. It was much discussed in the West, and eventually led to an important correspondence between Mozoomdar and Max M√ºller about the relationship between Hinduism and Christianity. After Mozoomdar published the correspondence it led to controversy in both Britain and India. M√ºller's efforts to get Mozoomdar to state openly that he was now a Christian were rejected by Mozoomdar, who argued that the label \\"Christian\\" did not properly articulate his own positive view of Jesus as a model of self-sacrifice, one whose actions and claims to divinity he interpreted from within the Brahmo philosophy. In turn M√ºller stated that Christians should learn from the Brahmos and should abandon the traditional Christian formulation of Atonement.M√ºller, Georgina, The Life and Letters of Right Honorable Friedrich Max M√ºller, 2 vols. London: Longman, 1902. Mozoomdar also wrote several books about the spiritual and social ideals of the Brahmo movement and a biography of Sen, The Life and Teachings of Keshub Chunder Sen (1887). He also wrote a biography of Ramakrishna, of whom he expressed deep admiration. He attended the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893 as a delegate for the Brahmo Samaj. In October 1893, Mozoomdar was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1919, the collected precepts of Protap Chunder Mazoomdar were published titled as 'Upadesh'. The writings of Mazoomdar reflects an outlook that freely acknowledges the value and fundamental affinity of different religions - including Christianity, Islam, or Judaism - and the religious figures associated with their origin and propagation.

Boroondara General Cemetery, often referred to as Kew cemetery, is one of the oldest cemeteries in Victoria, Australia, created in the tradition of the Victorian garden cemetery. The cemetery, located in Kew, a suburb of Melbourne, is listed as a heritage place on the Victorian Heritage Register. History The cemetery site was reserved in 1855 and trustees were first appointed in 1858. A site plan was drawn up by Frederick Acheson, a civil engineer in the Public Lands Office, with the layout segregated by religious denomination, a common occurrence at the time. The first burial took place in 1859. In 1864 Albert Purchas, who was architect and surveyor for the Melbourne General Cemetery, joined the trust. Purchas is believed to be the designer of the landscape layout as well as many of the features of the cemetery including the cast iron entrance gates (1889), the rotunda (1890) and the surrounding ornamental brick wall (1895‚Äì6), as well as various additions to the original 1860 Cottage in the period 1866‚Äì1899 including the clock tower. The design of the cemetery was influenced by the Victorian garden cemetery movement. This influence was reflected in the curving path network following the contours of the site, the creation of defined views and a park like setting. In the latter half of the twentieth century the cemetery was becoming full and many pathways and grassed verges were used to provide new burial sites. At the same time, many of the older Victorian monuments began to fall into disrepair due to their age and lack of funding to maintain them. However, since about 2010, with the assistance of enthusiastic volunteers from the Friends of Boroondara (Kew) Cemetery, the cemetery is undergoing a horticultural renaissance, returning to its early glory as a garden cemetery. In 2001 the Peace Haven Mausoleum was built by the Cemetery Trust to cater for growing demand for above-ground burials and interments, and in 2011 garden crypts were opened in a bushland setting near the High Street pedestrian gate. The cemetery is still an operating cemetery, offering a range of burial and interment options. Burials and memorials Syme Memorial. The cemetery has had more than 80,000 burials since 1859. Among these are some very prominent Melburnians. The Syme memorial was constructed in 1908 in memory of David Syme, publisher of The Age newspaper. It has a temple-like appearance and Egyptian motifs. Between 1889 and 1907 the Springthorpe Memorial was constructed on behalf of Dr John Springthorpe in memory of his wife, Annie and in 1912 the Cussen Memorial was commissioned by Sir Leo Cussen, a judge of the Victorian Supreme Court as a memorial to his son, Hubert.

Shibusawa wrote many short stories and novels based on French literature and Japanese classics. His essays about black magic, demonology, and eroticism are also popular in Japan. Early life Shibusawa was born in the upper-class neighborhood of Takanawa in Tokyo. His father was a banker, and his mother was the daughter of an industrialist and politician. He was distantly related to the famous Shibusawa Eiichi. While going through high school during World War II, he had the ambition to be an aeronautical engineer. However, the possibilities for a career in that field disappeared with Japan's defeat in the war, and Shibusawa received notably poor scores in the German language, which was widely used in engineering at the time. He turned his attention to study of the French language instead. In 1950, after working as an editor at the Modern Nihon magazine under Junnosuke Yoshiyuki for two years (one of the authors he edited was Hisao Juran), Shibusawa entered the University of Tokyo's school of French literature, where he enthusiastically embraced the avant-garde movement of surrealism, which started in France after World War I. He was especially attracted to Andr√© Breton, and this led him to learn of the works of the Marquis de Sade. Although Shibusawa did graduate from a master's course at the University of Tokyo, he had to abandon plans to become a professor because of tuberculosis, and started his career as a freelance writer instead. He relocated from Tokyo to the resort town of Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture in 1946, due to its reputation for having a healthful climate for lung disorders, and continued to live there to his death. After publishing his first book, a translation of Jean Cocteau's Le Grand Ecart (Â§ßË∑®„Å≥„Çâ„Åç) in 1954, Shibusawa began to introduce French literature to Japanese readers through his translations. With the death of his father, he faced financial difficulties, and obtained a part-time job at the publishing company Iwanami Shoten, where he met his future wife, Sumiko Yagawa, who was also a translator and author. During this period, he also briefly flirted with politics, supporting the Japan Communist Party in an election for the mayor of Miura, Kanagawa by joining political rallies and distribution leaflets satirizing the opposing candidate. Literary career In 1959, Shibusawa published Akutoku no sakae (ÊÇ™Âæ≥„ÅÆÊ†Ñ„Åà), a translation of de Sade's L‚ÄôHistoire de Juliette; ou, Les Prosperites du vice. The work was immediately controversial, and in 1960, he and , the publisher, were prosecuted for public obscenity. During the trial, which is called Sade Trial („Çµ„ÉâË£ÅÂà§) in Japan, Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, Sh≈´saku End≈ç, Sh≈çhei ≈åoka and many other authors testified for the defense. However, in 1969, in an important decision, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that Shibusawa and Ishii were guilty. He was fined 70,000 yen (slightly less than US$200 at the time); the triviality of the sum greatly outraged him, given the nine years that the trial had taken from his life. Shibusawa, although discouraged, was not deterred, and continued to write works on eroticism and to translate the works of de Sade, as well as other French authors; he also produced essays and art criticism, and became a specialist in the study of medieval demonology. In September 1970, Shibusawa made his first overseas trip, a vacation to Europe. He was seen off at Haneda Airport by his close friend Mishima Yukio. Madame de Sade by Mishima (1965) is entirely based on Shibusawa's The Life of Marquis de Sade („Çµ„Éâ‰æØÁàµ„ÅÆÁîüÊ∂Ø, 1964); but on the other hand, today it is known that Shibusawa himself plagiarized his own work largely from Vie du Marquis de Sade by Gilbert Lely (1961). In The Temple of Dawn (1969), Mishima created based on Shibusawa's personality. 1981 he published a fantasy novel titled Karakusa Monogatari (‚ÄúKarakusa Story‚Äù). Other fantasy novels include Utsuro-bune (‚ÄúHollow ship‚Äù) and Takaoka Shinno Kokai-ki (‚ÄúThe Travels of Prince Takaoka‚Äù). Shibusawa died of a rupture of a carotid aneurysm while he was hospitalized for larynx cancer in 1987. His grave is at the temple of Jochi-ji in Kamakura.

It is situated in Kiruna Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden, with 303 inhabitants in 2010 and 350 in 2011. It is a church village, located alongside the Muonio River on the border with Finland. The Finnish village of Karesuvanto (population about 140) is located on the Finnish side of the river. According to Finnish tradition, they are one and the same village (with a combined population of about 470), but are usually considered to be separate villages since there is a national border between them (although both are called Karesuvanto in Finnish). The village's buildings were built in 1670, when M√•ns M√•rtensson Karesuando, called \\"Hyv√§ Maunu Martinpoika\\" in Finnish and \\"Good Maunu, Son of Martin\\" in English, bought land from Sami Henrik Nilsson Nikkas. The Lutheran vicar and botanist Lars Levi Laestadius served in Karesuando from 1826 to 1849. It was here that he founded the revivalist movement known to this day as Laestadianism. The area is traditionally Finnish speaking, and the border was drawn for political reasons in 1809, not because of any cultural or any other border existing at that time. There was not even a parish border, so Karesuando Church was built because the older church was on the Finnish side. School and church influences have since resulted in cultural and linguistic differences. Karesuando is located along the European route E45, and is the northern terminus of Swedish national road 99. Climate Karesuando has a continental type of a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen Dfc) with short and cool summers and long, cold and sometimes very cold winters. Snowfall varies from year to year, but is often quite moderate due to dry polar air. Still, accumulation in spring is usually quite high since the snow cover does not thaw at all during winter due to the cold averages. Summers on the other hand, see quite a bit of rainfall. With Karesuando being quite far inland, it is prone both to sizeable warmth for short spells and temperatures either approaching or below . In spite of this cold, however, Karesuando sees some moderation from the North Atlantic Current passing by Scandinavia's western shore near land on those latitudes, which results in winter temperatures being less severe than some climates on latitudes way further south. Due to its high latitude, Karesuando experiences midnight sun and polar night. UV index in summer is low due to the high latitude.

Manker is considered one of the most maverick German-speaking actors, and polarizes public opinion like scarcely no other. He is perceived as a \\"staggering all-round talent on the Austrian cultural scene.\\" Life Manker is the son of actress and theatre director Gustav Manker. He trained at the Max Reinhardt Drama School in Vienna, studying acting and directing. Manker made his film debut in Lemminge (Lemmings) (dir. Michael Haneke) in 1979. Manker's initial engagements while still at drama school took him to the Viennese Burgtheater (1979, Arthur Schnitzler's Comedy of Seduction with set design by Hans Hollein and costumes by Karl Lagerfeld), then to the Vienna Festival (1980, The Last Days of Mankind by Karl Kraus), and on to participation in the \\"co-determination model\\" at the Schauspielhaus Frankfurt (1980/81), to the Thalia Theater in Hamburg (1982, Jean Genet's Deathwatch and also to the Residenztheater in Munich, where in 1983 he first worked with director Peter Zadek (Henrik Ibsen's The Master Builder with Barbara Sukowa), where he became a long-term member of Zadek's famous ensemble. As a film actor, Manker first appeared in Lemmings in 1979 (directed by Michael Haneke). Then followed Exit ‚Äì Don't Panic (1980) and The Locked-Out (1982, based on the novel by Elfriede Jelinek), The Power of Emotions by Alexander Kluge (1983) and Who was Edgar Allan? (1984, also directed by Michael Haneke), as well as Luc Bondy's The Distant Land (1987), alongside Michel Piccoli. In 1986, Peter Zadek invited Manker to join the famous ensemble at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, of which he was a member from 1986 to 1989. Here, for the first time, he played on stage the leading role of anti-Semitic Jewish philosopher Otto Weininger in the play Weininger's Last Night by Joshua Sobol, which caused much furore. After that, he was Octavius Caesar in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar with Ulrich Tukur, Lindekuh in Frank Wedekind's Musik (Music) with Susanne Lothar, and slave trader Casti-Piani in Peter Zadek's legendary staging of Frank Wedekind's Lulu. Manker first worked as a film director in 1985, and his film Schmutz (Dirt) premiered at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival in the Quinzaine des R√©alisateurs. The film received several awards at other festivals, and was turned into a novel by Thorsten Becker. In 1988 there followed Weininger's Last Night, in 1992 The Eye of the Typhoon with German rock band Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, in 1995 The Moor's Head, based on a screenplay by Michael Haneke with Gert Voss in his first film role, and Angela Winkler, then in 1996 the documentary film Hans Hollein ‚Äì Everything is Architecture plus various short films including, in 2004, the portrait of his 80-year-old mother, actress Hilde Sochor. \\"As a director, Manker experiments with psycho shockers (Dirt, Weininger's Last Night) and draws the audience into his aggressive multimedia theatre dramas. Manker's general theme is the creeping insanity of a society to which he holds up a distorting mirror.\\" Manker first worked as a director at the Vienna Volkstheater, with Weiningers Nacht (Weininger's Last Night) by Joshua Sobol, in which he himself also played the leading role, and which became his most famous role. The performance became Manker's greatest triumph to date, and he himself subsequently turned the play into a film. \\"One rarely comes across such a sensuously and intellectually exciting, enlightening, sensational film.\\" (Simone Mahrenholz, Der Tagesspiegel) In 1990, Manker returned to the Viennese Burgtheater under Claus Peymann, and took the role of Carlos in Peymann's production of Goethe's Clavigo (with Ulrich M√ºhe as Clavigo). He was also Bassanio in Peter Zadek's production of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice (with Gert Voss as Shylock and Eva Mattes as Portia), and Pozzo in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot). In 1993, he staged Franz Molnar's Liliom at the Burgtheater, and in 1996 Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera (with costumes by Vivienne Westwood). Manker's performance as Shakespeare's Richard III (1997), staged by Peter Zadek at the M√ºnchner Kammerspiele, generated most heated discussions, where conflict arose with the theatre and its director Dieter Dorn, whereupon the production was cancelled despite its huge success with the public. \\"A huge success is being dropped here, one which could have been played for years, merely out of pusillanimity.\\" (Peter Zadek) In 1996, Manker and Israeli writer Joshua Sobol, who became his most important artistic partner, created Alma - Widow of the four Arts at the former Sanatorium Purkersdorf, a simultaneous drama about artists' muse Alma Mahler-Werfel and her men, which became a cult play and has since been played every year at a different venue, having already crossed three continents and had over 400 performances in Vienna, Venice, Lisbon, Los Angeles, Berlin, Jerusalem and Prague. The production involves the audience interactively in the creation of their own theatrical experience, and they become \\"companions of the figures journeying through the travel-drama, themselves selecting the events, the path and the person whom they follow, thereby constructing, destroying and resurrecting their own version of the polydrama\\". Between 1997 and 1999, the play was filmed under the title Alma ‚Äì Widow of the 4 Arts as a 3-part TV film. In the production, produced by Manker himself, Manker also has the role of the expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka. In 2000, with the cyber-show F@lco at the Viennese Ronacher Theatre, Manker and Sobol created a multimedia musical about the pop star Falco. Then in 2003, continuing the collaboration with Sobol, an invitation came from Tel Aviv to stage at the Cameri Theatre the premiere of Sobol's iWitness, the story of Franz J√§gerst√§tter, who refused to enter military service and was hanged by the Nazis, a parallel to the soldiers of the Israeli army who refused to serve in the Occupied Territories. The production made the young Itay Tiran a star. Manker played the suicidal organist in Joseph Vilsmaier's Brother of Sleep (1994), as well as playing in Michael Haneke's The Castle (1998) and in Code Unknown with Juliette Binoche (1999). He also performed in Michael Glawogger's film Slumming, a 2006 entry in the Berlin Film Festival competition section; in this film, with a \\"hyperplastic presence\\", Manker portrays homeless alcoholic Franz Kallmann in the style of a po√®te maudit, \\"truly setting his role on fire\\" (ARTE). Paulus Manker engaged in more theatre work with Luc Bondy (√ñd√∂n von Horvath's Figaro Gets a Divorce, 1998), with Christoph Schlingensief (Foreigners Out! Schlingensief's Container, 2000) and on repeated occasions with Peter Zadek (White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, 1996, Polonius in Hamlet, with Angela Winkler and Otto Sander, Hamburg, 2000), The Jew of Malta (2001) as well as in plays by Botho Strauss. In 2010 Manker appeared in the Salzburg Festival as Theseus in the acclaimed production of Jean Racine's Ph√®dre, playing alongside Sunnyi Melles. In the same year, he published a comprehensive book about his father, film director, set designer and theatre director Gustav Manker. In 2010, Manker was awarded the prestigious Nestroy Audience Award. Collaboration with Joshua Sobol Israeli writer Joshua Sobol is Manker's most important artistic partner. Manker has been working with him since 1985, and together they have completed a whole series of projects intended to create new spatial realms and forms of theatrical experience. In 1995, together with Niklas Frank, they adapted Frank's reckoning with his father Hans Frank, Hitler's governor-general in Poland. At the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, the audience was turned on a revolving stage from scene to scene, and with the aid of hydraulics, even taken down below stage. They called it a \\"horror train trip\\" and used film clips and documents from Frank's private family album. In 1996, Manker and Sobol created their most successful project to date: Alma ‚Äì Widow of the four Arts, an interactive drama about Alma Mahler-Werfel, in which over 50 scenes were played simultaneously in the rooms of the art-deco Sanatorium Purkersdorf outside Vienna. The show's 16-year history to date has taken the performance of Alma on tour to the various cities in which her life unfolded: Venice (2002), Lisbon (2003), Los Angeles (2004), Petronell near Vienna (2005), Berlin (2006), to Semmering in 2007, Jerusalem in 2009, from 2008 to 2010 to Vienna, and in 2011 in Prague. In 2000 Sobol and Manker created a multimedia spectacle at the Viennese Ronacher Theatre: F@lco - A Cyber Show, about Austrian rock star Falco, which was presented on a stage built out into the auditorium in an @ shape in the form of a rock concert with laser, 3D animation and water screen, where the audience was directly involved and could smoke, eat and drink and join in the dancing. By way of contrast, the \\"remote\\" audience stood in the boxes, from where they could see both the play and the participating audience.

Description Adults occur in 2 color morphs, in either brown or dark grey plumage. They have a round head with ear tufts, yellow eyes and a yellowish bill. The bird looks very similar to a western screech owl, but has heavier barring on the breast, and is slightly smaller in size. Range and habitat The whiskered screech owl's range extends from southeasternmost Arizona (the Madrean sky islands region) in the United States, southwards through Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, to north central Nicaragua. Their breeding habitat is dense coniferous or oak woodlands, and coffee plantations usually occurring at higher elevations than the western screech owl. Behavior These birds wait on a perch and swoop down on prey; they also capture targeted food items in flight. They mainly eat small mammals and large insects, with grasshoppers, beetles, and moths making up a large portion of their diet. They are active at night or near dusk, using their excellent hearing and night vision to locate prey. The most common call is a series of about 8 regularly spaced \\"boo\\" notes, slightly higher in the middle, slightly lower at each end. 3 to 4 eggs are usually laid in April or May, usually found in a tree cavity or old woodpecker hole 5 to 7 meters above the ground. Subspecies There are 3 recognized subspecies: *Megascops trichopsis aspersus Brewster, 1888 *Megascops trichopsis mesamericanus (Van Rossem, 1932) *Megascops trichopsis trichopsis (Wagler, 1832) References * \\"National Geographic\\" Field Guide to the Birds of North America *Handbook of the Birds of the World Vol 5, Josep del Hoyo editor, *\\"National Audubon Society\\" The Sibley Guide to Birds, by David Allen Sibley, External links *Photo-High Res; Article \\"Birds of Honduras\\" *Whiskered Screech Owl photo gallery VIREO Category:Megascops Owl, Whiskered Screech Owl, Whiskered Screech Owl, Whiskered Screech Owl, Whiskered Screech Owl, Whiskered Screech Owl, Whiskered Screech Category:Natural history of the Mexican Plateau Category:Birds described in 1832 ","title":"Whiskered screech owl"},{"id":"7058878","text":"Meet Betty Carter and Ray Bryant is a 1955 jazz album by singer Betty Carter and pianist Ray Bryant both debuting here on record as leading artists.According to the original liner notes.

All other Access Manager services and components are built upon this base foundation. Another component that is very close to the base components is called a resource manager. It is responsible for applying security policy to resources.

The historicity of a claim about the past is its factual status. Historicity denotes historical actuality, authenticity, factuality and focuses on the true value of knowledge claims about the past.Harre, R., & Moghaddam, F.M. (2006). Historicity, social psychology, and change. In Rockmore, T. & Margolis, J. (Eds.), History, historicity, and science (pp. 94‚Äì120). London: Ashgate Publishing Limited. Some theoreticians characterize historicity as a dimension of all natural phenomena that take place in space and time. Other scholars characterize it as an attribute reserved to certain human phenomena, in agreement with the practice of historiography.Jones, Michael S., \\"Lucian Blaga, The Historical Phenomenon: An Excerpt from The Historical Being\\" (2012). Faculty Publications and Presentations. Paper 1. Herbert Marcuse explained historicity as that which \\"defines history and thus distinguishes it from 'nature' or from the 'economy'\\" and \\"signifies the meaning we intend when we say of something that is 'historical'.\\"Herbert Marcuse, Hegel‚Äôs Ontology and the Theory of Historicity, trans. by Seyla Benhabib (Cambridge, MA; London: The MIT Press, 1987), 1. The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy defines historicity as \\"denoting the feature of our human situation by which we are located in specific concrete temporal and historical circumstances\\". For Wilhelm Dilthey, historicity identifies human beings as unique and concrete historical beings. Questions regarding historicity concern not just the issue of \\"what really happened\\", but also the issue of how modern observers can come to know \\"what really happened\\".William J. Hamblin, professor of history at Brigham Young University. Two part article on historicity, and This second issue is closely tied to historical research practices and methodologies for analyzing the reliability of primary sources and other evidence. Because various methodologies thematize historicity differently, it's not possible to reduce historicity to a single structure to be represented. Some methodologies like historicism can make historicity subject to constructions of history based on submerged value commitments.Hall, J. (2007). Historicity and Sociohistorical Research. In W. Outhwaite, & S. Turner (Eds.), The Sage Handbook of Social Science Methodology. (pp. 82‚Äì102). London: Sage Publications Ltd. Hall, J. (2007). History, Methodologies, and the Study of Religion. In J. Beckford, & N. Demerath (Eds.), The SAGE Handbook of the Sociology of Religion (pp. 167‚Äì189). London: Sage Publications Ltd. The historiographer Fran√ßois Hartog introduced the notion of regime of historicity to describe a society that considers its past and attempts to deal with it, a process that is also cited as \\"a method of self-awareness in a human community\\". The historicity of a reported event may be distinct from the historicity of persons involved in the event. For example, a popular story says that as a child, George Washington chopped down a cherry tree, and when confronted about it, honestly took responsibility for the act. Although there is no doubt that Washington existed as an historical figure, the historicity of this specific account has been found lacking,D.R. Woolf, A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing - Volume 2 (2014), p. 642-43. Questions of historicity are particularly relevant to partisan or poetic accounts of past events. For example, the historicity of the Iliad has become a topic of debate because later archaeological finds suggest that the work was based on some true event. Questions of historicity arise frequently in relation to historical studies of religion. In these cases, value commitments can influence the choice of research methodology.

Raised on a Pueblo reservation in New Mexico, and of First Nations and Swiss ancestry, as a young man in 1970 he traveled to Guatemala. After a year, he settled in a Tz'utujil village near Lake Atitlan. He learned their Mayan language and studied with a shaman. He assimilated into village life, marrying a Tz'utujil woman and having a family with her. After his mentor's death, he became accepted as the temporary shaman of the Tz'utujil people in the Atitlan region. During the extended Guatemalan civil war, Prechtel and his family fled to the United States for safety. The couple separated and their two sons joined their father in the US. He began to share his spiritual teachings from the Maya, and contributed to workshops sponsored by poet Robert Bly, who was leading the Men's Movement. Prechtel has published several non-fiction books drawing from his time in Santiago Atitlan, Guatemala; the first was published in 1998, and the most recent in 2015. Prechtel settled near Ojo Caliente, where he operates a school. He also lectures internationally and gives workshops on spirituality.  Life  Prechtel was raised on a Pueblo Indian reservation near Ojo Caliente, New Mexico. He learned the Keres language as well as English growing up.Prechtel, Martin in Jensen, Derrick. 2011. Truths Among Us: Conversations on Building a New Culture. Oakland, CA: PM Press. p. 254. His mother was a First Nations Canadian and his father a Swiss paleontologist. In 1970 his mother died and Prechtel ended his first marriage. He started traveling, going south through Mexico and entering Guatemala. After a year of traveling through the country, he settled in a small village near Lake Atitlan, which was inhabited by the Tz'utujil (one of the numerous ethnic Maya peoples). There he met Nicolas Chiviliu Tacaxoy, a respected shaman of the village, who told him that Prechtel was the student he had prayed for. The American began studying with the Mayan shaman. Prechtel learned the Tzutujil language, married a Tzutujil woman, and helped raise their two sons (a third son died young). He eventually became one of the most important village members, both spiritually and politically.Jensen, Derrick. 2011. Truths Among Us, p. 234. When his teacher and mentor Chiviliu died, Prechtel became acting shaman to the approximately thirty thousand people of Santiago Atitlan. Prechtel also joined the Scat Mulaj (the village political body). During his time there, he rose to the position of Nabey Mam (the first chief). He was responsible for leading the initiation and ritual passage of the village's young men into adulthood. As the violence of the Guatemalan civil war (1960‚Äì1996) increased, when government forces were attacking the Mayan villages in the highlands, Prechtel and his family fled for their lives. In 1984 they settled in the U.S. His wife returned to Guatemala later with their two sons, and the couple divorced. The two boys later returned to the US to live with their father.Prechtel, Martin in Jensen, Derrick. 2011. Truths Among Us, p. 252. Upon resettling in the US, Prechtel was introduced to poet Robert Bly, who was active in leading what he called a Men's Movement. He began contributing to Bly's workshops, and Bly was instrumental in getting Prechtel's writing published, writing the Foreword to his first book, which was published in 1998. Prechtel married again, to a woman named Hanna, and resides in New Mexico, at the site of the school he founded near his former home village of Ojo Caliente. The school is called Bolad's Kitchen. Prechtel speaks at different international educational conferences and leads workshops to assist in individuals reconnecting to the sacredness in nature and daily life. In addition, he helps them find a sense of purpose in the modern world. Colleagues include Robert Bly, Malidoma Som√©, and Michael J Meade. Prechtel has published several non-fiction books drawing from his learning among the Maya in Guatemala. These include Secrets of the Talking Jaguar (1998), an autobiographical account of his initiation as a Mayan shaman, which is likely the best known. Robert Bly wrote the Foreword. Publishers' Weekly said he described his apprenticeship to a shaman and 13 years of living as a Tzutujil, saying \\"his view seems at times romanticized\\" but he portrays an \\"idyllic Indian life\\" of \\"colorful rituals and rapport with nature.\\" Long Life, Honey in the Heart (1999) is an account of his village life in Santiago Atitl√°n; Stealing Benefacio's Roses: A Mayan Epic (formerly titled The Toe Bone and The Tooth), an autobiographical account of how he relived an ancient Mayan myth; and The Disobedience of the Daughter of the Sun, a Mayan myth that includes Prechtel's observations of how the Maya relate to the story. His newest book is The Smell of Rain on Dust: Grief and Praise (2015). His works also include paintings and various musical recordings.

It was first marketed by IBM Systems Supplies Division (SSD) in 1972. The processor washed fresh blood or frozen, thawed blood. In the case of frozen, thawed blood, the blood was washed to remove the cryogenic agent, typically, glycerol. History and Development In 1964, IBM received a grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This was a result of an IBM engineer, George T. Judson, requesting to work on a continuous-flow blood centrifuge. He had observed the need for such a machine when visiting NCI in 1962 after his son was diagnosed with leukemia. As a result of this work, IBM developed the NCI-IBM Blood Cell Separator which was announced in 1965. At that announcement, Judson and his co-worker Alan Jones were approached by Dr. James R. Pert, Director of the American Red Cross Blood Research program in Washington, DC. He told them of the need for a machine to separate packed red cells from glycerol. The glycerol is added to the red cells to protect the cells during freezing. The Processor was announced in September 1972 at the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) in Washington, DC. Up until the 1970s, SSD had been at the heart of IBM, for it had produced the millions of punch cards that had been extremely profitable for IBM for more than four decades. By the 1970s business was declining, as IBM's concentration increasingly turned to computing. Accordingly, the vice president in charge of SSD, Everett \\"Van\\" Van Hoesen, avidly searched for any new business that could be slotted into SSD. So SSD, an otherwise dying division, became a hotbed of innovation. Searching for these new products Van started a campaign to win the first (2991) product 'mission', though SSD did not have any significant history of machine production. One key factor, though, was that the products being tendered for also comprised a substantial element of on-going income from the related supplies. In the case of the blood products the annual supplies income could easily run at a rate approaching the capital value of the machine. It was a situation that was familiar to SSD, brought up on the similar philosophy inherent in the punched card business. Van won the mission, probably due to his enthusiasm; and assisted by the fact that the business was much less attractive to other plants. SSD subsequently added the IBM 2997 Blood Cell Separator and the IBM 5880 ECG System to its line of products. Methodology The machine works by spinning a unit of blood in its centrifuge with various concentrations of saline solution. The machine spins the red cells in a circular bag and then uses a hydraulic system to express out saline, plasma, glycerol used in the freezing process, and unwanted plasma proteins. The blood is washed in a special, single-use washing kit with a circular bag and five tubing lines branching from a central tube from the circular bag. These lines are inserted into the unit of blood to be processed, saline solutions, or an attached waste bag. The washed blood can be labeled in the circular bag or transferred into a more traditionally shaped blood storage bag. Because the washing process creates an open system, red blood cells washed with this machine expire after 24 hours when kept at 1-6 ¬∞C. Current Use The IBM 2991 is still in use today in many blood banks for washing red blood cell units. The machine is now manufactured and supported by Terumo BCT and sold as the COBE¬Æ 2991 cell Processor.COBE¬Æ 2991 Cell Processor Category:Blood 2991 ","title":"IBM 2991"},{"id":"7059061","text":"Lumbriculus mukoensis was described by Yamaguchi in 1953 from specimens collected at Muko in Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan.

He is most famous for his anthem \\"Boom Wah Dis\\", which was recorded on the Steely & Clevie riddim called \\"Street Sweeper\\". Burro emerged during the mid-1980s at the beginning of the digital dancehall craze started by King Jammy that also featured artists like Cutty Ranks. He is known for his very aggressive style; deep, gruff voice; and was the inspiration for many modern dancehall artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, and Elephant Man. Biography Banton's career began in 1976 when he entered a talent contest at the Skateland discoth√®que in Kingston.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p.18 His early influences included Ranking Joe, Dillinger, Trinity, U Brown, and Ranking Trevor. It was around 1978 he first worked with the sound system called Black Hoover, later moving to the Roots Unlimited sound system where he worked alongside Josey Wales. He finally established his public reputation and career in 1982 as a DJ for the Gemini sound system and continued in their employment for a further two years. Through the middle and late-1980s, his skills as a DJ enabled him to work for Volcano, Stero Mars and the Kilimanjaro sound system, where he was featured with Super Cat and Nicodemus. Banton's first recording was with the legendary producer Henry \\"Junjo\\" Lawes, owner of the Volcano sound-system. Banton released his first LP, Buro, in 1983.Buro - Buro at Roots Archives In 1984 he toured Canada with John Wayne and began to nurture the career of his prot√©g√©, Little Burro. As the 1990s approached, Burro Banton continued working with Super Cat and Nicodemus. Super Cat formed the \\"Wild Apache\\" label, where Burro recorded his first recording of a #1 hit, \\"Boom Wah Dis.\\" When Super Cat signed with Columbia/SME Records, Burro Banton joined forces with the ace producer Bobby Konders and the Massive B label in 1991. Here, Burro Banton recorded numerous #1 hits including \\"Washington Session\\", \\"Tek a Set\\", \\"Westmoreland Sensi\\", and many more. Massive B released Burro's second LP, The Original Banton in 1995. Burro continued recording with Massive B until 1998 and during this period worked with Steely and Clevie, one of Jamaica's most respected production teams, for whom he reworked his earlier hit \\"Boom Wah Dis\\" on their \\"Street Sweeper\\" riddim, scoring another #1 hit from Kingston, Jamaica, to New York to Miami and beyond. It was in heavy rotation around the world for many months in reggae and Caribbean-music circles. 2000 and Beyond Extending his recording career with Massive B in 2000, his releases titled \\"Politicians\\" on the \\"Lickshot Rewind\\" riddim delves into hard time in the ghetto of Kingston and wishes the politicians would keep their promises of a better life. In addition, he released \\"Phenomenon 2\\" on the Dun Dem riddim, in which he praises the role played by people involved in the ganja trade. His latest efforts on Massive B's Rock, Penicillin, and Tempo riddims features a #1 European single called \\"Jah Jah Rules\\". Burro Banton has been touring constantly over the last ten years across Asia, Europe, and throughout North America. He has shared the stage with Capleton and Bounty Killer, just to name a few and stands out in his performances due to his originality.

It is operated by Genesis Energy Limited, a publicly listed company (currently 51% owned by the NZ Government), and is capable of supplying over 31% of the country's current electricity needs. The station has four operational generating units ‚Äì two 250 MW coal-and-gas-fired steam turbine units, a 50 MW gas peaking plant, and a 403 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant. The station also plays an important role in voltage support for the Northland, Auckland and Waikato regions. Operation Generation Each of the four original generating units, which are capable of burning either coal or gas, installed in stages between 1973 and 1985, is capable of generating 250 MW (Megawatts) of electricity, giving a historical generating capacity of 1000 MW. Its chimneys are 150 metres high and each chimney has two flues that are 7 metres in diameter. The plant uses a reheat steam cycle, with C A Parsons turbines and Combustion Engineering boilers. In 2004 the power station was upgraded with the addition of a 50 MW gas turbine plant, and in 2007 the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant was commissioned. This plant increased the total generating capacity of Huntly by 403 MW (250 MW gas turbine + 153 MW steam turbine). The new turbine represented an investment of NZ$520 million and it increased the total installed capacity to 1453 MW. In 2007, Huntly operated at a load factor of 85% and was providing a large amount of the baseload energy needs of the northern North Island. In 2007, the plant was mainly gas-fired, but a dry winter in 2008 prompted more coal thermal generation. In December 2012, Genesis Energy placed one of the four Huntly Power Station 250 MW units into long-term storage. The second coal-fired 250 MW unit was permanently retired in June 2015 after being placed in storage (with a 90 day return to service) in 2013. Fuel and coolant The four 250 MW units were constructed as dual fuel, able to operate on natural gas from Taranaki or coal from the nearby Rotowaro coal mine. A 10 km conveyor belt was constructed to carry coal from the mine to the power station. Previous to the substitution of coal, Huntly used gas from the fields to power the generation of the main units as well, but these were switched in the 1990s because of dwindling resources. Natural gas to power units 5 and 6 comes from several gas fields in Taranaki. The gas is transmitted along the 307 km, 750 mm diameter Maui gas pipeline from Oaonui production station near Opunake, which was commissioned in 1979 to supply the station. The station uses water from the Waikato River for cooling. However, in order to protect aquatic life, conditions are imposed by the resource consent (issued under the Resource Management Act), specifying the quantity of water that can be removed by the station along with the maximum temperature of the water when returned to the river (25 ¬∞C). These conditions mean that on very hot summer days the station cannot operate at maximum capacity, and has sometimes effectively been shut down. A new cooling tower has been built as part of expansion works at the site, which allows one 250 MW unit to run at full load even during such times. Transmission and distribution The majority of the energy generated at Huntly Power Station is transmitted through the national grid to Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, which lies to the north of the station. Huntly is connected to the rest of the national grid via a large substation switchyard and six 220 kV transmission circuits carried on three high capacity transmission lines. These transmission lines are: * a double circuit line (HLY-TMN-A) to Stratford in Taranaki, via Te Kowhai and Taumarunui * a double circuit line (HLY-OTA-A) to Otahuhu substation in Auckland, via Drury and Takanini * a double circuit line (HLY- DEV A) to the Ohinewai switching station, where it connects with the Otahuhu to Whakamaru C line The Huntly switchyard also includes a grid exit point for supply to the local distribution network in the Huntly area. Future The plant, as the biggest carbon dioxide greenhouse gas generators of the country, contributing over half of New Zealand's emissions of greenhouse gases from electricity generation, has repeatedly drawn the ire of environmentalists and has been the focus of associated protests. A 2006 government report outlining future climate change mitigation and energy policies was seen by the operator as a sign that the plant might have to be closed by 2015 under these plans, with around 10 years of design life still remaining. It was also noted that, apart from being difficult to replace as a source of power (due to New Zealand's annually growing generation demand, especially around Auckland), such a decision would also be uneconomical for the foreseeable future, even if coal prices were to rise. In May 2012, resource consent was granted by the Waikato Regional Council to continue running the gas and coal units for a period of 25 years. This shows that the Huntly Power Station can continue to have a strategic long term role in New Zealand energy generation. In April 2016, Genesis Energy announced that the Huntly Power Station would continue operation of its two remaining coal / gas burning units until December 2022. The two gas turbine generators would continue to operate into the future. Company chief executive Marc England has stated \\"By 2025, Genesis will only use coal in its thermal units in abnormal market conditions, and it is our intent to remove coal completely by 2030\\". In popular culture In the online game ElectroCity, run by Genesis Energy, coal-fired power stations take the form of Huntly. The Huntly Power Station features in the video for the Purple Pilgrims song \\"Two Worlds Apart\\".

In 1962, Judson's son, Tom, was diagnosed with leukemia. His physician was able to have Tom admitted to the Clinical Center of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). On admission, they showed Judson a procedure to remove white blood cells from a patient. It was laborious. They would remove two units (450 ml) of blood, spin them in a bucket centrifuge, express the plasma into a satellite bag, and the white cells into another satellite bag. The packed red cells and the plasma would be recombined and administered to the patient. This would be repeated over and over. Judson, being an engineer, suggested that this could be done on a continuous-flow basis. He was sent to see Dr. Emil J. Freireich who expressed enthusiasm for the project. Judson returned to IBM and asked for a year's leave of absence to work on his ideas. IBM gave him the one-year leave with pay and provided engineering assistance. His work led to the development of the NCI Blood Cell Separator and later to the IBM 2990 Blood Cell Separator which could harvest white blood cells from blood donors, to support leukemia patients to keep them alive. The subsequent development of the machine as the IBM 2997, essentially a continuous centrifuge which separated the blood into red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood plasma (used in plasmapheresis), was picked up by IBM's Systems Supplies Division (SSD) which was already ready marketing the IBM 2991 Blood cell Processor.

He was the son of Zengi and brother and successor of Sayf al-Din Ghazi I. Biography At the death of Zengi, his possessions were divided between his sons: Nur al-Din received Aleppo and Saif al-Din Ghazi Mosul, while Qutb al-Din Mawdud received the emirate of Homs. After the death of Saif al-Din Ghazi in 1149, Qutb al-Din Mawdud was the first to arrive in Mosul and have himself recognized as emir; Nur al-Din, who desired to add the city to his lands, occupied Homs and Sinjar, preparing to attack his brother. Only the intervention of veterans of the Aleppo army, who refused to take part in the fratricide war which would weaken the effort against the Crusaders and the emirate of Damascus, forced Nur al-Din to renounce to the expedition and to reconcile with his brother. During his reign in Mosul, Qutb held the Seljuq prince, Suleiman-Shah b. Muhammad b. Malik Shah, as a prisoner until 1160.The Political and Dynastic History of the Iranian World, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 5, ed. John Andrew Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 1968), 169. In 1164, Shirkuh, a general of Nur al-Din, fought King Amalric I of Jerusalem for the control of Egypt. When he found himself in a weak situation, Nur al-Din launched an expedition against the Principality of Antioch to divert the Christian forces. The Artuqid emirs of Mardin and Diyarbakƒ±r, as well as Mawdud, joined him in the attack, which turned to be successful: the towns of Harim and Banias were captured, and Amalric had to abandon Egypt. For the same reason, Mawdud helped his brother in the County of Tripoli in 1167. At the beginning of 1168, Kara Arslan, the Artuqid emir of Hasankeyf, died, and Qutb al-Din Mawdud tried to conquer that city; but he was pushed back by Nur al-Din, who had promised to defend Arslan's successors.

In Nigeria he is best known as an Idol series judge.Nigerian Idol Career Daniel was born in Los Angeles. During his career he has taught, worked and ranked alongside musicians and dancers such as Shabba Doo, Geron Casper Candidate, Derek Cooley Jackson/Jaxson, Popin' Pete and The Electric Boogaloos. Daniel first performed \\"the backslide\\", a physically complicated dance technique (originally performed by the dance group \\"The Lockers\\"), now known as the \\"moonwalk\\", on British television during a performance of Shalamar's \\"A Night to Remember\\" on Top of the Pops. The song was a hit in 1982, almost a year before Michael Jackson moonwalked on the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever television broadcast; he was a big fan of Soul Train \\\\- on which Jeffrey Daniel had been a back-up dancer. According to Jackson's sister La Toya, Jackson was a fan of Daniel's dancing and sought him out. He soon met, hired and learned from Daniel. Daniel gives great credit to a man that inspired him, the original dance 'Locker' Don Campbell, one of the earliest Soul Train dancers. He also gives thanks to Cleveland Moses Jr. his partner on Soul Train and to Tyrone Proctor who was the premier 'Waack' dancer who taught Jeffrey the style of dance known as 'Waacking'. It was on Soul Train whilst doing a routine dressed in black that Daniel and Geron 'Caszper' Candidate and Derek 'Cooley' Jackson/Jaxson first performed the moonwalk on U.S. television. Shalamar Daniel and his Soul Train dance partner Jody Watley, (whom he had known since she was twelve years old from church) along with Howard Hewett, became the world-famous soul funk group Shalamar who performing live such songs as A Night To Remember, I Can Make You Feel Good, Friends, Make That Move, Sweeter As The Days Go By, There It Is and I Owe You One, together with Carolyn Griffey ‚Äì the daughter of Solar Records founder Dick Griffey. Daniel had become something of a style icon with his ever- changing hair styles and unique dress sense. He was often seen on the London club scene with the likes of Bananarama, Wham and Culture Club. After seven years, millions of albums sales, and tours around the world, Shalamar performed at London's Wembley Arena and went their separate ways in 1984. Soon after, Daniel took on the role of 'Electra' in Andrew Lloyd Webber's new West End musical Starlight Express which involved wild costumes with complex choreography on roller skates. Also in 1984 Daniel appeared in the Paul McCartney movie Give My Regards to Broad Street displaying his signature robotic or marionette-like dancing style (with McCartney, his wife Linda McCartney and members of the band Toto made up as marionettes) to the Wings hit, \\"Silly Love Songs\\". In 1985, Daniel hosted 620 Soul Train, a British version of Soul Train produced with the blessing of Don Cornelius. Work with Michael Jackson By 1987, Daniel was working with Michael Jackson who had always been a fan of Daniel's dance style since watching him on Soul Train in the 1970s. He was hired as co-choreographer on the \\"Bad\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\" videos with primary choreographer [Vincent Paterson in which he also starred with his \\"dance brothers\\" Geron \\"Caszper\\" Candidate and Derek \\"Cooley\\" Jackson/Jaxson. Daniel was later employed as a creative and choreography consultant on his world tours and the video Ghosts. Daniel's music and dance expertise was then employed when he became a consultant at the MJJ Productions record label to whom Brownstone, 3T and Men of Vizion were signed. Michael Jackson flew Daniel back to live in the United States from Japan where Daniel had taken up residence since leaving the United Kingdom. Recent years Today, Daniel works and lives in Lagos, London and Osaka, Japan. He is a fluent speaker and writer of the Japanese language with a fair grasp of Cantonese. He continues to perform, choreograph, produce and compose with some of the biggest names in show business. He has worked with Babyface, LL Cool J, Paul McCartney, Sheena Easton, The Go-Go's and Vanessa Williams. He joined Nigerian Idol as a judge in 2010 for three seasons and has been performing live shows with a reformed Shalamar since 2002. The Shalamar lineup is Daniel, Howard Hewett and Carolyn Griffey.

Later that night, the police find the van on fire with the charred remains of the nun and an unidentified man presumed to be Norman. Since this happened at the same time as a massive car pile up, they are exhausting their resources trying to identify the victims to notify their next of kin and can not get around to positively identifying Norman's remains. Meanwhile, across town, Sam and Lila Loomis are murdered by an assailant with a knife. Claiborne is convinced that Norman faked his death and proceeded to kill them, but the police are skeptical. As they are surveying the crime scene, they see a news article talking about a movie being made based on Norman's life. Claiborne is convinced that Norman is going to Hollywood to kill everybody involved in production, so he heads out there to stop him. Fearing the worst, Claiborne gets a job as a technical consultant on the film to keep an eye on everything. He gets introduced to the cast and crew, including director Vizzini, who is the spitting image of Norman twenty years previously. Claiborne keeps thinking that something bad is going to happen, but nobody believes him until the movie's producer gets decapitated with a meat cleaver. At the scene of the crime, Claiborne and Officer Ames find out about Vizzini's past: his mother was raped and murdered when he was a child. Meanwhile, Vizzini calls the actress playing Marion Crane to the movie studio where the shower scene is going to be shot under the guise of rehearsing the scene, but he is really planning on raping and murdering her. It turns out that his childhood trauma has affected his sexual morality. Claiborne gets a bad feeling about Vizzini and heads over to the movie studio to try to stop him. Moments after he leaves, the phone rings and Ames answers it only to be in touch with the officer investigating Norman's disappearance. They have conclusively identified the charred remains in the van as Norman's. It turns out while Norman planned on killing the hitchhiker to fake his death, the hitchhiker actually overpowered Norman and killed him in self-defense. He had a criminal record and was worried about going back to jail, so he burned the van to hide the evidence and went into hiding. However, the hitchhiker really thought he was killing a nun instead of a disguised Norman. The thought of killing a nun weighed on his conscience and he eventually turned himself in. Ames concludes that if Norman is dead, Vizzini must be the murderer and he requests officers to go to the movie studio. Meanwhile, Vizzini tries to rape the actress. However, she fights him off and kicks him hard enough to send him into the prop shower behind the curtain. Vizzini screams loudly and emerges with a large stab wound before dropping dead. The assailant then takes the knife and approaches the actress. However, before he can stab her, the police show up and shoot him. As he falls, he is revealed to be none other than Dr. Claiborne. He survives the shooting and ends up committed to the very asylum that Norman spent twenty years in. Claiborne's colleague deduces that he put so much time and energy into Norman Bates, that when Norman died, Claiborne realized he would never get the fame he wished for and the trauma of this reality gave him Norman's split personality. This split personality killed Sam and Lila, Vizzini, and the producer. Now, his colleague is hoping that he will one day be cured, but he is not very hopeful.

This is opposed to the belief that the same thing, in particular normative institutions or correlated ideologies, are natural or essential and thus exist universally. Historicity relates to the underlying concept of history, or the intersection of teleology (the concept and study of progress and purpose), temporality (the concept of time), and historiography (semiotics and history of history). Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events.  Concepts of historicity  In phenomenology, historicity is the history of constitution of any intentional object, both in the sense of history as tradition and in the sense where every individual has its own history. Of course, these two senses are often very similar: One individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in, but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition. In addition, personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition. Martin Heidegger argued in Being and Time that it is temporality that gives rise to history. All things have their place and time, and nothing past is outside of history. Ingo Farin argues that Heidegger appropriated the concept from Wilhelm Dilthey and from Paul Yorck von Wartenburg Farin, Ingo. \\"Three levels of historical analysis in early Heidegger.\\" The New Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy XII XII (2013): 1-37. and further clarifies Heidegger's meaning: : Heidegger calls authentic historicity the historical awareness that recognizes this whole range (i.e., the ‚Äúsimultaneity‚Äù of past, present, and future in the historical action one resolves to undertake). Francis Fukuyama, in The End of History and the Last Man, famously argued that the collapse of Soviet communism brought humanity to the \\"end of history\\" whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism. Before Fukuyama, Jean Baudrillard argued for a different concept of the \\"end of history\\". Baudrillard's most in-depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books Fatal Strategies and The Illusion of the End. It is for these writings that he received a full- chapter denunciation from the physicist Alan Sokal (along with Jean Bricmont), due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time, space and stability. In contrast to Fukuyama's argument, Baudrillard maintained that the \\"end of history\\", in terms of a teleological goal, had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress, civilisation and rational unification. And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century, brought about by the \\"speed\\" at which society moved, effectively \\"destabilising\\" the linear progression of history (it is these comments, specifically, that provoked Sokal's criticism). History was, so to speak, outpaced by its own spectacular realisation. As Baudrillard himself caustically put it: :The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.Jean Baudrillard, The Illusion of the End, 1994, p. 26; also in Jean Baudrillard, Selected Writings, 2001, p. 263. This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard's affinities with the postmodern philosophy of Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard: the idea that society ‚Äî and Western society in particular ‚Äî has \\"dropped out\\" of the grand narratives of history (for example, the coming of Communism, or the triumph of civilised modern society). But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that, although this \\"dropping out\\" may have taken place, the global world (which in Baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a universal humanity) is, in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself, condemned to \\"play out\\" this illusory ending in a hyper-teleological way ‚Äî acting out the end of the end of the end, ad infinitum. Thus Baudrillard argues that ‚Äî in a manner similar to that of Giorgio Agamben's book Means without Ends ‚Äî Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist. Michel-Rolph Trouillot offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of historicity. Trouillot explains, \\"The ways in which what happened, and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical\\".

Located on ACDC Lane (off Flinders Lane between Russell St and Exhibition St), the bar replaced existing artists studios in the building to make a rock music venue that has become a popular concert after-party venue for touring bands and their crews. Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher was so taken with the bar during the band's 2002 Australian tour, he made an offer to purchase it.Donovan, Patrick: Noel Gallagher speaks his mind, The Age, 2 December 2005. Other high-profile international visitors included Mick Jagger, Johnny Marr (from The Smiths) and Lady Gaga. In the early 2000s punters were brought to Cherry through its Deep Funk nights on Wednesdays with John Idem, hiphop Thursdays, and the consistent rock n' roll weekend nights. Thursday nights was Soul night, while rock from all genres and eras was played on weekends by founder Bill Walsh, Max Crawdaddy,http://www.rrr.org.au/presenter/max-crawdaddy Rock DJ Paul Miles,http://www.paul-miles.com/Rock-DJ-Paul-Miles.htm and Little Scotty. Later, the DJ roster included rock DJs Mary M, Dom, Kez, DJ Mermaid and Leaping Larry L, with radio PBS announcers Vince Peach and Pierre Baroni helming Thursday night's Soul In The Basement. Local promoter and former radio and television presenter James Young has been managing Cherry with a consortium since 2006. Although inaccurately reported by Melbourne's Herald Sun that the building was destroyed by fire on 5 June 2008, it was in fact the offices located in the floors above which burned, whereas the Cherry bar, being located in the basement of the building, suffered only water damage. The bar was expected to reopen following two weeks cleaning and restoration of the electricals damaged by the water used in the fire-fighting effort http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23819178-661,00.html but building complications delayed the re-opening until New Year's Eve. As regulars of Cherry, rock band Airbourne reference the bar in the lyrics of their song Fat City: \\"Midnight bite at the Cherry, so sweet is the juice.\\" Melbourne-band Jet also drew upon their many long nights spent at the bar as an influence for their song Rollover DJ, after an inebriated band member was rebuked for spilling his drink over the in-house DJ's records. In 2018 indie rockers Glomesh released the track Crawlin' Up AC/DC Lane. The filmclip for Kylie Auldist's track Sensational was filmed at Cherry, as were scenes from the big-budget 2002 vampire flick Queen Of The Damned, featuring locals among the extras.

Roughly 19 kilometers southeast of the town of Michalovce, Pavlovce sits, as its name indicates, on the south bank of the Uzh River (), about eight kilometers west of the border with Ukraine. The population of the village is around 4,500 inhabitants. Apart from the village itself, which predates medieval times, the municipality Pavlovce nad Uhom was established in 1960 by union of two separate municipalities ‚Äì Pavlovce nad Uhom and ≈§ahy≈àa. History After decay of Great Moravian Empire, Slovak territory including East Slovak Lowland became part of Kingdom of Hungary for next to near thousand years. Its territory became colonized by Hungarians, in three phases, who have sequentially mixed with native Slavic and Slovak population. New guarding posts, settlements of strategical importance started to grow up on border lines of young Kingdom of Hungary. According to professor Ferdinant Uliƒçn√Ω, Pavlovce nad Uhom was established by watch-keeping units of The CumansUliƒçn√Ω F., 1995, p. 329 (in Russian: –ü–æ–ª–æ–≤—Ü—ã ‚Äì Polovtsi,Polovci; in slovak: Plavci). Captured Cumans were forced to carry out watch-keeping military service. The name Pavlovce, Plavce was not given to early settlement by The Cumans themselves but Slovak inhabitants and Hungarian noblesUliƒçn√Ω F., 1995, p. 174 during the following decades. On the other hand, others stand for different explanation, that the name was derived from popular Slavic name Pavol.Stanislav J., Slovensk√Ω juh v stredoveku I, Bratislava 1999, p. 390 The first written record of the municipality dates to 1327 when Charles I of Hungary in his donation agreement confirmed ownership of Pavlovce in favor of Peter called T√∫z. In 1417, for the merits of Matthew II of Pavlovce (?-1437) and George of Pavlovce (?-10.4.1439, Esztergom), members of noble family from Pavlovce (de Pal√≥cz), emperor Sigismund, Sigismund of Luxembourg rewarded the two brothers with confirmation of their ownership.Uliƒçn√Ω F., 1995, p. 97 In 15th and 16th century, Pavlovce became the center of manor consisting of surrounding municipalities such as: Be≈æovce, Blatn√° Polianka, ƒåabraƒè (pri Be≈æovciach), Chyzzer (pri Bajanoch), Kapu≈°ianske Kƒæaƒçany, I≈àaƒçovce, Rebr√≠n, Senn√©, Ta≈°uƒæa a Z√°hor.Maksay F., Magyarorsy√°g birtokviszonyai a 16. sz√°zad k√∂z√©pen, Budape≈°≈• 1990, p. 852 Later, in 1670, manor of Blatn√Ω potok (S√°rospatak) was attached.

In the 17th century, reformation movement was spreading through Kingdom of Hungary, anti-Turkish and anti-Habsburg wars took place negatively affecting local population with camping armies and heavy taxes.Autorsk√Ω kolekt√≠v, Pavlovce nad Uhom-Prech√°dzka hist√≥riou a s√∫ƒçasnos≈•ou,2006, str.51, In 1670, the municipality lost its owner Mikul√°≈° Forg√°ƒç and was consequently divided among few nobles such as George and Imrich Horv√°th of Pavlovce. In 1711, after Treaty of Szatm√°r, the followers of Francis II R√°k√≥czi (1676‚Äì1735) were forced, under the threat of losing wealth or exile, to swear allegiance to the king. This was the case of two nobles to whom Pavlovce belonged, Francis Bark√≥ci and George Horv√°th.Autorsk√Ω kolekt√≠v, Pavlovce nad Uhom-Prech√°dzka hist√≥riou a s√∫ƒçasnos≈•ou,2006, str.57, Geography The village lies at an altitude of 108 metres and covers an area of 33.420 km¬≤.

The municipality used to be part of Ung County during epoch of Kingdom of Hungary. Pavlovce nad Uhom as we know it today was created in 1960 by merge of Pavlovce nad Uhom and ≈§ahy≈àa. Demographics According to 2008 data, the majority of the population of the city (about 57,7%) are ethnically Roma.Romani children segregated in Slovakia‚Äôs schools, Amnesty International, 24 July 2008 Geology and geomorphology Geomorphologically, Pavlovce nad Uhom belongs to East Slovak Plain and its subgroups of Kapu≈°any Flatlands and Senn√© Wet Ground.Atlas krajiny Slovenskej republiky, Bratislava 2002 Countryside of planes and flood plains consists of holocene clay and loamy sand sediments, the remains of old river arms. Geological structure consists of flood plain sediments, pleistocene aeolian sands and sand dunes. Climate Area of Pavlovce nad Uhom is drained by river Uzh which originates in Ukrainian Uzh Pass and leads to river Laborec near municipality named Stretavka. Total catchment area of river Uzh is 2791 km¬≤, including 792 km¬≤ on Slovak territory and its total length is 127 km, including 19,6 km on Slovak territory.

Medieval church Medieval church, known to exist in 13th century already, had unknown consecration. We know, from letters of George and Matthew of Pavlovce, that the church contained family tomb. Nowadays, the exact location of the church is not confirmed. Medieval mansion Peter T√∫z or his sons established medieval family mansion in Pavlovce which later evolved into fortified manor-house mentioned as \\"castellorum Palocz\\". As far as we know, its remains are probably located in western part of local park.Autorsk√Ω kolekt√≠v, Pavlovce nad Uhom-Prech√°dzka hist√≥riou a s√∫ƒçasnos≈•ou,2006, str.193, Baroque-classicist manor house Manor house was located in the center of municipality circa 100 meters south of church and 40 meters west of main road. Rectangle alike ground plan with dimensions of 40x50 meters with rhomboid alike ground plan towers in corners surrounded a courtyard with dimensions of 25x35 meters within. Locals say that the manor house's 4 wings and 4 towers symbolized 4 seasons, 12 chimneys 12 months, 53 rooms 53 weeks and 365 doors and windows 365 days in a year. The manor house was severely damaged after WWII and thus, in fifties, pulled down by locals afterwards.Archives of The Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic, Research Report from 18 June 1954 Many photographs of the manor house still exist in private or state-owned archives. Garden pavilion The pavilion was located in northern part of the park separating park from a garden. The building was built in Empire style with rectangle alike ground plan with dimensions of 40x14 meters. Farmstead in Ortov This agricultural building, built in Classicist style, was situated south of floodplain forest near river arm Ortov. Central part of the building served as granary, side wings as sty and the rest for various agricultural purposes. Preserved architectural and historical monuments The following monuments can be seen in the municipality. Roman Catholic Church of st. John the Baptist The church was completed in the nineties of the 18th century.Archives of The Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic, Research Report from 18 June 1954 Wall paintings, including pictures of the church itself and Esztergom Basilica on each side of triumphal arch, come from 1843. Single-aisle body of the church is vaulted with two fields of Prussian vaults. Rotating stairs in southern part of the church lead to three-axis matroneum above, containing an organ. Communion-table, sanctuary and seats for celebrants are located in the northern part of the church. Room above sacristy holds seats, reserved in the past for patrons, nobles. There is wooden Classicist altar from year 1800Archives of The Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic, Research Report from 18 June 1954 with modern Statue of the Sacred Heart located in the right part of triumphal arch and preserved original Classicist pulpit with conic tribune and canopy on the left. The Statue of Immaculate Heart of Mary on the left and Statue of the Sacred Heart on the right decorate the facade of the yellow-white building. Church tower holds bell-fry and mechanism of functional tower clock. Riding hall Neo-Classical building, among locals called \\"rajƒçuƒæ≈àa\\", was probably built at the end of the 19th century. The Holy Shrine of John of Nepomuk The Holy Shrine of John of Nepomuk, built in 1899 in Neoclassical style, covers late Baroque statue of the saint from the second half of the 18th century originally located south of the park (according to historical map from 1863). Image of the sandstone statue follows an artwork made by John Brokoff being exposed on Charles bridge. Depicted clothing consists of surplice and biretta, pointing to John of Nepomuk's occupation as vicar and priest as well. The polychrome statue of the saint standing on pedestal holds a crucix with corpus resting on the chest in his right hand. The left hand, left alongside the body, carries a palm twig. Defunct manor- house's park The park, with an overall area of 19.89 ha, was established in the first half of the 19th century near defunct manor-house and is registered by The Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic as National Cultural Monument. The park's entrance is located at the center of the village. The park features two playgrounds, an amphitheater (serves as pub) with a stage and projecting masonry cab, Special Elementary School yard and dilapidated pub known as \\"Letn√°\\". A mound, among locals called \\"Hurka\\", is located in the western part. The park is mostly flat except for the amphitheater's slope, the mound \\"Hurka\\" and excavation with adjacent embankment called \\"Filagr√≥via\\". The following plant species can be found here: oak, linden, maple, hornbeam, ash, sycamore, horse chestnut, hawthorn, hazel, privet, mulberry, elderberry, elm, willow and ivy. Greek Catholic Temple of the Holy Trinity of Ease The sacral building dated to the early nineties of the 19th century, situated in the part ≈§ahy≈àa, is registered by The Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic as a National Cultural Monument. Jewish cemetery The Jewish cemetery is located 1.5 kilometers south of the municipality on a hill near floodplain forest surrounded by cultivated field. Most of the tombstones are made of sandstone.

Its common name is cypress daisy-bush. It is a light open shrub reaching a maximum height of 1.5m. Its rodlike leaves are about 6 mm long. White daisy-like flowers about 6 mm in diameter cover the bush in August to October. It is typically found in Box-Ironbark forests, ranging from South Australia across Victoria. Under cultivation, it can be pruned after flowering to encourage a bushy shape. It is frost-resistant. The species was formally described in 1853 by German botanist Otto Wilhelm Sonder based on plant material collected from the Mount Lofty Ranges. Sonder gave it the name Eurybia tertifolia. It was renamed firstly as Aster teretifolius in 1865 and finally Olearia teretifolia in 1867 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller.

It houses the Gro√üer Refraktor (Great Refractor), which is the longest pointable telescope in the world. It is also called the Himmelskanone (Celestial Cannon).  History   Industrial Exposition  The Great Refractor at the Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin 1896 The Archenhold Observatory began as a temporary installation at the 1896 Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin. At the initiative of Wilhelm Foerster and Max Wilhelm Meyer, it was intended to present scientific and astronomical knowledge to the general public. Plans for a large telescope that Friedrich Simon Archenhold had been working on were invoked for this purpose. Although his plans were for a research instrument, its design was already being criticised at the time. Admittance charges at the exposition were intended to finance the construction and later relocation of the instrument. The telescope was erected in the Treptower Park and sheltered in a wooden building that also provided exhibition space and a lecture theatre. When the industrial exposition opened on 1 May 1896, the Great Refractor was still unfinished; it began operation in September 1896. The telescope has an aperture of and a focal length of ; the movable mass is 130 metric tons. Due to the late completion there was no finance to move the telescope after the exposition. At the end of 1896 the city of Berlin gave permission for the observatory to remain in Treptower Park. Archenhold, without an astronomer's salary, decided to turn the installation into a public observatory. It was operated by a society, the Verein Treptow-Sternwarte e. V. with Archenhold as president. This is now considered the oldest and largest public observatory in Germany. The exhibition covered themes like history of astronomy, Earth and Moon, Sun and planets, comets and meteors, stars and star clusters, instruments and optics. Observations included standard objects, lunar eclipses, comets and the Nova Cygni 1903. 23,000 visitors attended in 1897, the number rising to 60,000 by 1899 and remaining about constant until the 1930s.  New building  In 1908, the original wooden building was demolished and on 4 April 1909 a new building was inaugurated. On 2 June 1915, Albert Einstein gave his first public talk about General Relativity at the observatory. In 1931, Friedrich Simon Archenhold was succeeded as director by his son G√ºnter Archenhold. Due to his Jewish ancestry, he was forced to resign in 1936. The family was expelled from the observatory; some emigrated, others ended up in Nazi concentration camps. The observatory was integrated into the city's school system. During World War II a bomb hit the southwest wing, but the Great Refractor was not severely damaged. Observations resumed as soon as July 1945 for the solar eclipse. Edgar M√§dlow was interim director, assisted by Herbert Pfaffe.  Naming after Archenhold  Participants of the IIIrd World Festival of Youth and Students visit the Archenhold Observatory in August 1951 In 1946 the city of Berlin renamed the observatory Archenhold- Sternwarte. On 1 June 1948 Diedrich Wattenberg, who had been working with Archenhold, was made director. Annual visitor numbers rose from 8,000 in 1946 to 25,000 in 1949. In 1958, the Great Refractor was decommissioned, but retained as a monument of technology. From 1959 onwards, the observatory was increasingly used for school education in physics and astronomy. To support this, in the 1960s, two further domes were erected in the grounds. A lecture theatre was also added, and in 1966 the solar physics cabinet was created, which could project the Sun at diameter or a solar spectrum at length. In November 1976, Wattenberg retired and Dieter B. Herrmann was made director of the observatory. In March 1982, the planetarium was replaced. 1983 saw the completion of the reconstruction of the Great Refractor, which had started in 1977. Annual visitor numbers during the 1980s were around the 70,000 mark. Archenhold had already suggested a major planetarium. This became reality in 1987 when the Zeiss Major Planetarium was built in the Ernst-Th√§lmann-Park. Until 2013 it and the Archenhold Observatory formed a single organisational entity.  Berlin re-united  The telescope among the buildings. After German reunification in 1990, the observatory came under control of the city's school administration. Significant repairs of the Great Refractor had to be carried out in 1989/1990 and 1995. As of 2018, the telescope remains operational and is available for night observing. The observatory underwent major refurbishment in 1995/1996. The exhibition was also completely revised. Since 2002, the observatory belongs to the German Museum of Technology. Dieter B. Herrmann retired in 2005. The observatory was then led for a while by the head of the astronomy department of the technology museum, Klaus Staubermann. In 2009, Felix L√ºhning became director of the Archenhold Observatory.  Equipment  Video recording of the Great Refractor The Great Refractor of the Archenhold Observatory  Great Refractor  The Great Refractor was built in 1896 for the Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin. With an aperture of , a focal length of and a movable mass of 130 metric tons, it is a masterpiece of technology. The lenses were made by C. A. Steinheil & S√∂hne. Since 1967, the telescope is a protected monument.  Zeiss Small Planetarium  The planetarium is located in an dome with 38 seats. In 1959 it was the first Zeiss Small Planetarium in the GDR. In 1982 it was replaced with the more modern ZKP-2 projector. In 1994 the planetarium room was refurbished.  Solar physics cabinet  The solar physics cabinet is situated in the grounds of the observatory. It was designed and built in 1965 by Diedrich Wattenberg and Erwin Rolf. A coelostat redirects the light from the Sun into the building. The sunlight is optionally dispersed into the spectral colours through four 60¬∞ prisms. With an H-alpha filter it is possible to observe prominences and active regions on the Sun.  Further telescopes  In 1962, two observing domes were erected in the grounds north of the main building. These have diameters of and , resp. They house a Zeiss Cassegrain telescope ( aperture, focal length) and a refractor with coud√© focus ( aperture, focal length). Two further domes on the roof of the main building house an astrograph ( aperture, focal length) and the historic Urania Refractor of 1888, which was transferred from the Berlin Urania. Two further shelters with roll-off roof on top of the main building contain a comet seeker ( aperture, focal length) and a Newtonian telescope ( aperture, focal length).

Production and use  Petit-suisse is a fromage frais, an unripened, unsalted, smooth, and creamy cheese with a texture closer to a very thick yogurt than a typical cheese. It is made from cow's milk enriched with cream so that its dry solids contain about 40% fat content (around 10% in the actual product eaten). The cheese is then smoothed and drained in a centrifuge. A typical cheese weighs 30 or 60 grams and is packaged in a cylinder around 4 cm high and 3 cm diameter or 5 cm by 4 cm in the larger size. Petit-suisse may be consumed with sugar, as a dessert either on its own or with jam or honey, or salted and peppered with herbs. It is also used in meat stuffings. A mixture of petit-suisse and mustard is sometimes applied to rabbit to prevent the meat from drying during cooking.  History and development  Contrary to what its name suggests, petit-suisse did not originate in Switzerland, but in Normandy, where in the 1850s, a Swiss employee at a dairy in Auvilliers (Normandy) suggested adding cream to enrich the curd used for cheese. Originally, it was sold in a thin paper wrapping and packaged in wooden boxes, six to a box. The cheeses weighed 60 grams each and were called simply \\"suisse\\" (Swiss). Today, they are made throughout France. Though the 60-g version is often seen labelled petit suisse, the term is sometimes reserved for the 30-g ones, the larger ones then being referred to as a double petit-suisse, double suisse, or suisse double.

Their single \\"Generator\\" reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart on 11 June 2007. They had five No.1 singles on the UK Indie Chart and several Top 40 singles. Their debut album, So This Is Great Britain?, was awarded 8 out of 10 by NME. Former band member Rob Skipper died on 3 October 2014 in Brighton from a heroin overdose. Formation David Jackson and Bryn Fowler established the beginnings of the band, finding Rob Skipper at the live music venue Nambucca on Holloway Road in North London. They would meet later to jam together, playing in future drummer Dave Danger's room (situated above the club). After an hour of jamming, Jackson and Skipper had six songs with guitar and fiddle parts and harmonizing vocals. Impressed by what he heard from the three, Dave Danger then joined the band. They toured with Babyshambles, The Pogues, The Kooks, The Rakes, The Wombats, The Pigeon Detectives and CSS, as well as helping launch careers of Frank Turner, Kid Harpoon and Johnny Lloyd of Tribes inviting them to support on their numerous UK tours. In 2010, Reservoir Media Management acquired 100% of the Holloways publishing assets which had formerly been administered by TVT Music Enterprises, LLC. In October 2014, founding member Rob Skipper died of a heroin overdose. Notable performances They played at Glastonbury several times during their career including a slot on the Other Stage in 2007. Other festivals included Ibiza Rocks, Summer Sonic Festival in Japan, V Festival, London Calling in Amsterdam and Lovebox Festival in the UK. Split and post Holloways musical projects The Holloways announced in 2011, that they were to split. On 23 May 2011, they played their last gig at the Relentless Garage on Holloway Road in London. During the gig the band reunited with previous band members to play a 70-minute set of songs from throughout their career. HARES Founding member and lead guitarist went on to front the short-lived folk rock band Rob Skipper & The Musical Differences, and later fronted HARES, whose Coastlines EP was well received by critics, topping the Music Week Top Ten Playlist and making it to XFM's Exposure Top 5 list. HARES have toured the UK extensively with One Night Only, Pigeon Detectives and The Vaccines, have performed at Glastonbury, T in the Park, Hop Farm, Big Reunion and Strummer of Love festivals.

It is included in the Catholic Church's list of Latin titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, )  History  thumb Temple of Tyche, Olba. Olba was a city of Cetis in Cilicia Aspera, later forming part of Isauria. It was situated at the foot of the Taurus Mountains, on a tributary of the Calycadnus. According to Greek mythology, Olbe had been built by Ajax, the son of Teucer; it contained a temple of Zeus, whose priest once ruled over all Cilicia Aspera. Strabo described it: :\\"Above this [Kyinda] and Soloi [in Kilikia] is a mountainous country, in which is a city Olbe, with a temple of Zeus, founded by Aias the son of Teukros. The priest of this temple became dynast of Kilikia Trakheia; and then the country was beset by numerous tyrants, and the gangs of pirates were organized. And after the overthrow of these they called this country the domain of Teukros, and called the same also the priesthood of Teukros; and most of the priests were named Teukros or Aias.\\"Strabo, Geography 14. 5. 10 (trans. Jones) The temple would have been closed when Christianity was introduced during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. During the 1st century BC, it was ruled by the local tyrants Zenophanes and his daughter Aba. Later, it became a Roman colony. Strabo calls it Olbe (·ΩåŒªŒ≤Œ∑). Ptolemy calls it Olbasa (·ΩåŒªŒ≤Œ±œÉŒ±). Stephanus of Byzantium calls it Olbia (·ΩàŒªŒ≤ŒØŒ±). A coin of Dioc√¶sarea, Olbos; Hierocles (Synecdemus, 709), Olbe; Basil of Seleucia (Mirac. S.Thecl√¶, 2, 8) and the Greek Notiti√¶ episcopatuum, Olba. The primitive name must have been Ourba or Orba, found in Theophanes the Chronographer, hence Ourbanopolis in \\"Acta S. Bartholomei\\". In Christian times, it was regarded as belonging to Isauria, and was the seat of a bishop. Its ruins, north of Silifke in the Turkish province of Mersin, are called Oura in Turkish.  Ecclesiastical history  Olba was a suffragan of the Metropolitan of Isauria's provincial capital Seleucia, but faded like most sees in Asia Minor. Olba maintained a sizable Christian population in the 4th and 5th centuries, when the Temple of Zeus was converted into a church. Michel Le Quien (Oriens christianus, II, 1031) gives four bishops between the fourth and seventh centuries; but the Notiti√¶ episcopatuum mentions the see until the thirteenth century.  Titular see  The diocese was nominally restored as titular bishopric of the episcopal (lowest) rank under the name Olba (Latin and Curiate Italian); Latin adjective Olbiensis.

Back-arc basins are geologic basins, submarine features associated with island arcs and subduction zones. They are found at some convergent plate boundaries, presently concentrated in the western Pacific Ocean. Most of them result from tensional forces caused by oceanic trench rollback (the oceanic trench is wandering in the seafloor direction) and the collapse of the edge of the continent. The arc crust is under extension or rifting as a result of the sinking of the subducting slab. Back-arc basins were initially a surprising result for plate tectonics theorists, who expected convergent boundaries to be zones of compression, rather than major extension. However, they are now recognized as consistent with this model in explaining how the interior of Earth loses heat. Cross- section sketch showing the development of a back-arc basin by rifting the arc longitudinally. The rift matures to the point of seafloor spreading, allowing a new magmatic arc to form on the trenchward side of the basin (to the right in this image) and stranding a remnant arc on the far side of the basin (to the left in this image).  Characteristics  Back-arc basins are typically very long (several hundreds to thousands of kilometers) and relatively narrow (a few hundred kilometers). The restricted width of back-arc basins is probably because magmatic activity depends on water and induced mantle convection and these are both concentrated near the subduction zone. Spreading rates vary from very slow spreading (Mariana Trough), a few centimeters per year, to very fast (Lau Basin), 15 cm/year. These ridges erupt basalts that are similar to those erupted from the mid-ocean ridges; the main difference is that back-arc basin basalts are often very rich in magmatic water (typically 1-1.5 weight % H2O), whereas mid-ocean ridge basalt magmas are very dry (typically <0.3 weight % H2O). The high water contents of back-arc basin basalt magmas is derived from water carried down the subduction zone and released into the overlying mantle wedge. Additional source of water could be the eclogitization of amphiboles and micas in the subducting slab. Similar to mid-ocean ridges, back-arc basins have hydrothermal vents and associated chemosynthetic communities.  Seafloor spreading in back-arc basins  Evidence of this spreading came from cores of the basin floor. The thickness of sediment that collected in basin decreased toward the center of the basin. The idea that thickness and age of sediment on the sea floor is related to the age of the oceanic crust was proposed by Harry Hess. Magnetic anomalies (see Vine‚ÄìMatthews‚ÄìMorley hypothesis) of the crust formed in back-arc basins deviated in form from the crust formed at mid-ocean ridges. In many areas the anomalies do not appear parallel. The profiles of the magnetic anomalies in the basin do not show symmetry or a central anomaly as a traditional ocean basin does. This has prompted some to characterize the spreading in back-arc basins to be more diffused and less uniform than at mid-ocean ridges. The idea that back-arc basin spreading is inherently different that mid-ocean ridge spreading has been debated through the years. Another argument put forward is that the process of seafloor spreading is the same but the movement of seafloor spreading centers in the basin causes the asymmetry in the magnetic anomalies. This can be seen in the Lau back-arc basin. Though the magnetic anomalies are more complex to decipher the rocks sampled from back-arc basin spreading centers do not differ very much from those at mid-ocean ridges. The volcanic rocks of the nearby island arc do differ from those in the basin. The islands of Japan were separated from mainland Asia by back-arc spreading.  Asymmetry in seafloor spreading  Back-arc basins are different from normal mid-ocean ridges because they are characterized by asymmetric seafloor spreading, but this is quite variable even within single basins. For example, in the central Mariana Trough current spreading rates are 2‚Äì3 times greater on the western flank whereas at the southern end of the Mariana Trough the position of the spreading center adjacent to the volcanic front suggests that overall crustal accretion has been nearly 100% asymmetric there. This situation is mirrored to the north where a large spreading asymmetry is also developed. Other back-arc basins such as the Lau Basin have undergone large rift jumps and propagation events that have transferred spreading centers from arc-distal to more arc-proximal positions although recent spreading rates appear to be relatively symmetric with perhaps small rift jumps. The cause of asymmetric spreading in back-arc basins remains poorly understood. General ideas invoke asymmetries relative to the spreading axis in arc melt generation processes and heat flow, hydration gradients with distance from the slab, mantle wedge effects, and evolution from rifting to spreading.  Formation and Tectonics  The extension of the crust behind volcanic arcs is believed to be caused by processes in association with subduction. As the subducting plate descends into the asthenosphere it is heated up causing the volcanism at the island arcs. Another result of this heating is a convection cell is formed (See figure 1). The rising magma and heat in the convection cell cause a rift to form. This rift drives the island arc toward the subduction zone and the rest of the plate away from the subduction zone. This process is also known as trench rollback (also, hinge rollback). This is the backward motion of the subduction zone relative to the motion of the plate which is being subducted. As the subduction zone and its associated trench pull backward, the overriding plate is stretched, thinning the crust which is manifest in the back-arc basin. Therefore, back-arc basins form when the overriding plate is under extension. In some cases, extension is triggered by the entrance of a buoyant feature in the subduction zone, which locally slows down subduction and induce the subducting plate to rotate adjacent to it. This rotation is associated with trench retreat and overriding plate extension.[9] For back-arc extension to form, a subduction zone is required, but not all subduction zones have a back-arc extension feature. Back-arc basins are found in areas where the subducting plate of oceanic crust is very old. The age need to establish back- arc spreading is oceanic lithosphere that is 55 million years old or older. This includes areas like the western pacific where multiple back-arc spreading centers are located. The dip angle of the subducting slab is shown to be greater than 30¬∞ in areas of back-arc spreading. This is most likely due to the age of the slab. As oceanic crust gets older it becomes denser resulting in a steeper angle of descent. The thinning of the overriding plate at the back-arc (i.e., back-arc rifting) can lead to the formation of new oceanic crust (i.e., back-arc spreading). As the lithosphere stretches, the asthenospheric mantle below rises to shallow depths and partially melts due to adiabatic decompression melting. As this melt nears the surface spreading begins.  Sedimentation  Sedimentation is strongly asymmetric, with most of the sediment supplied from the active magmatic arc which regresses in step with the rollback of the trench. From cores collected during the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) nine sediment types were found in the back-arc basins of the western Pacific. Debris flows of thick to medium bedded massive conglomerates account for 1.2% of sediments collected by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). The average size of the sediments in the conglomerates are pebbles sized, but can range from granules to cobbles. Most of the material in these debris flows is volcanic in origin. Accessory materials include limestone fragments, chert, shallow water fossils and sandstone clasts. Submarine Fan systems of interbedded turbidite sandstone and mudstone made up 20% of the total thickness of sediment recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). The fans can be divided into two sub-systems based on the differences in lithology, texture, sedimentary structures, and bedding style. These systems are inner and midfan subsystem and the outer fan subsystem. The inner and midfan system contains interbedded thin to medium bedded sandstones and mudstones. Structures that are found in these sandstones include load clasts, micro-faults, slump folds, convolute laminations, dewatering structures, graded bedding, and gradational tops of sandstone beds. Partial Bouma sequences can be found within the subsystem. The Outer Fan subsystem generally consists of finer sediments when compared to the inner and midfan system. Well sorted volcanoclastic sandstones, siltstones and mudstones are found in this system. Sedimentary structures found in this system include parallel laminae, micro-cross laminae, and graded bedding. Partial Bouma sequences can be identified in this subsystem. Pelagic Clays containing iron- manganese micronodules, quartz, plagioclase, orthoclase, magnetite, volcanic glass, montmorillonite, illite, smec- tite, foraminiferal remains, diatoms, and sponge spicules made up the uppermost stratigraphic section at each site it was found at. This sediment type consisted of 4.2 percent of the total thickness of sediment recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). Biogenic pelagic silica sediments consist of radiolarian, diatomaceous, silicoflagellate oozes, and chert. It makes up 4.3% of the sediment thickness recovered. Biogenic pelagic carbonates is the most common sediment type recovered from the back-arc basins of the western Pacific. This sediment type made up 23.8% of the total thickness of sediment recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). The pelagic carbonates consist of ooze, chalk, and limestone. Nanofossils and foraminifera make up the majority of the sediment. Resedimented carbonates made up 9.5% of the total thickness of sediment recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). This sediment type had the same composition as the biogenic pelagic carbonated, but it had been reworked with well-developed sedimentary structures. Pyroclastics consisting of volcanic ash, tuff and a host of other constituents including nanofossils, pyrite, quartz, plant debris, and glass made up 9.5% of the sediment recovered. These volcanic sediments were source form the regional tectonic controlled volcanism and the nearby island arc sources. The active back-arc basins of the world  Location  Active back-arc basins are found in the Marianas, Tonga-Kermadec, S. Scotia, Manus, N. Fiji, and Tyrrhenian Sea regions, but most are found in the Western Pacific. Not all subduction zones have back-arc basins, some like the central Andes are associated with rear-arc compression. In addition, there are a number of extinct or fossil back-arc basins, such as the Parece Vela-Shikoku Basin, Sea of Japan, and Kurile Basin. Compressional back-arc basins are found, for example, in the Pyrenees and the Swiss Alps. The Black Sea formed from two separate back-arc basins.  History of thought  With the development of plate tectonic theory, geologists thought that convergent plate margins were zones of compression, thus zones of strong extension above subduction zones (back-arc basins) were not expected. The hypothesis that some convergent plate margins were actively spreading was developed by Dan Karig (1970) while a graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This was the result of several marine geologic expeditions to the western Pacific. See also *Back-arc region *Forearc basin *Intra-arc basin  Notes  References  Taylor, Brian. (1995).

The cars first arrived in December 2007 and delivery was completed in 2015. RATP ordered 160 trains or 800 cars in 2001, to replace the aging MF 67. It is used on Lines 2, 5, and 9. The MF 01 was first introduced to the press on June 17, 2005, but it would not be until January, 2006 that the first trains would undergo testing on the system. Commercial service on Line 2 began on June 11, 2008, with all of Line 2 being equipped with the new rolling stock by March, 2011. Testing quickly commenced on Line 5, where two trains were initially deployed. Commercial service on Line 5 began on June 15, 2011, with nearly 25 trains in service as of April, 2012. On February 9, 2011, the STIF voted to purchase MF 2000 stock for Line 9 at a cost of ‚Ç¨330 million. Deliveries took place in 2013, after all of the stock was delivered to Line 5, and will continue through 2016. The features of the Line 9 trains will be virtually identical to the trains on Lines 2 and 5, including the air conditioning systems. However, the trains feature a new joint RATP/STIF exterior livery that is based on the MI 09 commuter rail rolling stock on the RER A, marking the first time that the co- branded RATP/STIF livery is seen on the Metro. The first train (#096) for Line 9 was delivered in June, 2013 and began revenue service along Line 5 in July, 2013. The train was then prepared for revenue service on Line 9 in early October, 2013, going into revenue service on October 21, 2013.  Conception  With many of the MF 67 trains approaching 35 years old on Lines 2, 5, and 9, the RATP determined that a new class of steel-wheel rolling stock was needed. Due to changes in European legislation regarding competition, the RATP was required to change the way it awarded bids. This resulted in the RATP launching an open bid where numerous firms could take part. The winning consortium of four train manufacturers, namely Alstom, Bombardier, Technicatome and CSEE was chosen to manufacture the MF 2000 stock at a cost of ‚Ç¨800 million. It was the first time in history that the RATP has assigned four manufacturers to manufacture different components of the train cars. This process delayed the delivery by a year due to poor collaboration between the four companies, but the RATP has seen a drop in costs.  Description  The exterior design of the MF 01 was the result of a design competition, and the winning design is similar to the MP 89. The interior also looks similar to MP 89's interior, carrying on features like interconnecting gangways between cars, but with new security features added. The trains are the first rolling stock on the Paris Metro to include air-conditioning. Additionally, the MF 2000 consumes 30% less energy than its older counterparts due to innovations in traction and braking systems. Currently, pre-production train #001 contains the Dilidam multimedia system. Although all of the MF 01 trains are configured in a way so that the system can easily be installed, high cost has delayed implementation to all trainsets. The same train, in August 2014, became the first set to be repainted in the hybrid RATP/STIF livery and permanently reassigned to Line 9, having originally ran on Line 2.  Deliveries to Line 9  Unlike the previous deliveries of the MF 01 stock trains to Lines 2 and 5; deliveries to Line 9 will consist of placing trains into revenue service along Line 5 for a short time before being moved over to Line 9 for revenue service. The ongoing reconstruction of the Boulogne workshops along Line 9 prevents any mass cascading of rolling stock to occur, since the Auteuil workshops, which Line 10 temporarily shares with Line 9, are not equipped to handle maintenance operations for the MF 01 rolling stock, and thus heavy maintenance work must be done at the Bobigny workshops along Line 5.

In World War II Fletcher-Cooke joined the R.A.F. and was captured by the Japanese in Singapore. He was a prisoner for three and a half years, mostly in Japan; he wrote about his experiences in \\"The Emperor's Guest\\". He rejoined the colonial service after the war and was posted to Malta and Palestine. From 1948 to 1951 he was a Counsellor in the U.K. Mission to the U.N. in New York, where he met his future wife, Alice Egner. He served five years as Colonial Secretary, Cyprus, and later Deputy Governor, Tanganyika. He was the Conservative candidate at the Luton by- election in November 1963, following the resignation of the former \\"radio doctor\\" and Conservative Minister Charles Hill. Hill had a majority of over 5,000 at the 1959 general election, but the Luton seat was won by the Labour candidate Will Howie with a majority of 3,749. Fletcher-Cooke entered the House of Commons the following year at the 1964 general election, as Member of Parliament for Southampton Test. However, he lost his seat two years later, at the 1966 general election, to Labour's Bob Mitchell, and never re-entered Parliament. His younger brother Charles Fletcher-Cooke, was Conservative MP for Darwen from 1951 to 1983. The two clashed in the House of Commons over the Labour government's imposition of sanctions against Rhodesia, following the colony's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965 under Ian Smith. John opposed sanctions, but his brother supported them. Family John was the son of Charles Arthur Cooke (1883‚Äì1914) and Gwendoline May n√©e Bradford (1883‚Äì1977). He married first Alice E Egner on 3 September 1949 in New York; and second in Q1 1977 in Chippenham, Wiltshire Marie L Fournier de la Barre (1920‚Äì?).

The company was best known for its dramatic, large-scale environmental artworks in Scottish natural landscapes, building on the site-specific performances that Farquhar created with Test Dept. These works included The Secret Sign, The Path, The Storr and Half Life. The works were designed to involve local communities and to incorporate regeneration aspects that would benefit the landscapes in the future. For example, improvements were made to the footpaths around The Storr as part of the preparation for that work.  Selected works   The Secret Sign  The Secret Sign took place at night on 9‚Äì16 May 1998 at The Devil's Pulpit, Finnich Glen, near Loch Lomond. Audience members were transported by bus (with the windows blacked out) to the site of the work, where they were given hard hats and wading boots.

Life Petrhus held manual jobs from the age of ten, being apprenticed to a shoe factory in 1899. That year, he was baptized in the Baptist Church in V√§nersborg. After emigrating to Norway in 1900, he became co-pastor of the Arendal Baptist Church in 1902, along with Adolf Mildes. He started speaking in tongues, believed by Pentecostals to be evidence of having received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. After a series of meetings in Lillestrand. He claimed that the experience happened to him spontaneously and that he did not understand at the time what was happening to him. Pethrus became pastor of a small Baptist Church in Bengtsfors, Dalsland, in 1903, but did not seek formal theological training until 1904, when he enrolled at the Betel Seminary in Stockholm. He was later to say that his training was detrimental to his faith. Exposure to the writings of liberal philosopher Viktor Rydberg temporarily undermined his faith in the divinity of Jesus, but claimed to have regained it after meeting Jesus personally in a vision. After graduating from seminary, Pethrus completed his compulsory military service at Axvalla Hed, V√§sterg√∂tland, in the autumn of 1906. That year, he became pastor of the Lidk√∂ping Baptist Church. Pethrus joined the Pentecostal movement in 1907 after meeting the Norwegian Pentecostal minister Thomas Ball Barratt in Oslo. It was then that the doctrine of the baptism in the holy spirit and speaking in tongues became clear to him; he claimed: \\"From that moment I was part of the Pentecostal Revival\\". Pethrus became pastor of the Seventh Baptist Church in Stockholm in 1910 and of the Philadelphia Church in 1911. In 1913, the year in which he married Lydia Danielsson, his church was expelled from the Swedish Baptist Union due to disagreements about speaking in tongues and holy communion (his church practiced open communion). This was the beginning of a separate Pentecostal movement in Sweden. During the same phase of his life Pethrus wrote the words and music for his gospel song \\"L√∂ftena kunna ej svika\\" ('The promises cannot fail').Thoro Harris (1874‚Äì1955) made an English translation in 1918, with \\"All that our saviour hath spoken\\" as the first line and \\"Trust\\" as the title. Hymntime sites‚Äîfor the Swedish version, click here; for the English version, click here. The Filadelphia Church started a Bible school in 1915 and a weekly magazine, The Gospel Herald, in 1916. In the same year, the church sent its first missionaries, Samuel and Lina Nystr√∂m, to Brazil, helping the Assembleias de Deus. Pethrus and his Filadelfia Church sent many missionaries to Africa, Latin America and continental Europe, and kept ties with the North American Scandinavian Pentecostals belonging to the Fellowship of Christian Assemblies and the Independent Assemblies of God, International. Pethrus sponsored the founding of a high school in 1942 and Dagen, a daily newspaper, in 1945. A credit fund was established in 1952 and a radio station, IBRA Radio in Tangier, Morocco, in 1955. In the same year, the Philadelphia Church hosted the Pentecostal World Conference. Pethrus resigned from the pastorate on 7 September 1958. He continued preaching as an itinerant preacher, and established the Lewi Pethrus Trust for Philanthropic Endeavour in 1959. In 1964, he spearheaded the founding of Sweden's Christian Democratic Party. His wife Lydia died on 30 December 1966. A year before his own death, he was made a Knight Commander of the Vasa Order. His last sermon was delivered at the annual Nyhemsvecka Pentecostal convention in 1974, shortly before his death on 4 September.

He condemned Eutyches in the year 448, he \\"acquiesced\\" while \\"rehabilitating\\" at the Latrocinium in 449, \\"but recanted and signed\\" the Tome of Leo in 450. Biography His date of birth is uncertain; he died probably between 458 and 460, although Oxford cites his death at after 468; was distinguished during the period when the Eastern Church was convulsed by the Eutychian controversy, and was necessarily obliged to take sides in all the attendant disputes. Those of his writings which have come down to us, though perhaps too rhetorical and involved, suggest that he was a man of great literary ability. He was appointed Bishop of Seleucia in Isauria, between the years 432 and 447, and was one of those who took part in the Synod of Constantinople, which was summoned in 448 by Patriarch Flavian of Constantinople to assess the faith of the archimandrite Eutyches. Although in Constantinople he accepted Eutyches' condemnation, he attended the Second Council of Ephesus the next year (449), where he voted for the rehabilitation of Eutyches and for the deposition of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Later, at Chalcedon, he claimed that he had felt obliged to submit to the authority of the other bishops at Ephesus, particularly Dioscurus of Alexandria. Like many who had submitted to Dioscurus at Ephesus, he went on to accept the condemnation of both Eutyches and Dioscurus at Chalcedon. Throughout the turmoil, however, his personal confession remained consistent: the one Christ is fully human and fully divine, and either 'one nature' or 'two nature' language is orthodox if rightly understood. He is particularly notable for originating the qualified Dyophysite formula promulgated in the Chalcedonian definition: 'made known in two natures'. After Chalcedon, he seems to have continued a zealous opponent of the Miaphysite party, and in the year 458 he joined with his fellow-bishops of Isauria, in an appeal to the Emperor Leo I, requesting him to use his influence in forwarding the Decrees of Chalcedon, and in securing the deposition of Timotheus Aelurus, who had intruded himself in 457 into the Patriarchate of Alexandria. This is the last reference we find to Basil, and it is commonly supposed that he died shortly afterwards. Writings Forty- one sermons (logoi) on different portions of the Old Testament have come down to us under his name, and are found in Migne,Patrologia Graeca, LXXXV, 27-474. where is also his history of the protomartyr Thecla and of the miracles wrought at her grave.Patrologia Graeca, LXXXV, 477-618.

It was the most powerful self-propelled gun built by Italy in numbers during World War II.  History  The development of a self-propelled gun with high firepower was initiated during 1942 in parallel by Odera-Terni-Orlando (OTO) and Ansaldo. OTO proposed the installation of a 105/25 gun on the hull of a P26/40 tank. Ansaldo, for its part, proposed to use the hull of the Semovente M42 already in production and was therefore able to present, on 28 February 1943, its prototype to the Centro Studi della Motorizzazione while the OTO model was still in development. The production of the Ansaldo proposal was therefore approved by the Royal Italian Army. In the final version, with improved hull and the 105/25 gun, it was adopted on April 2, 1943 as the self- propelled M43 105/25, Bassotto (\\"Dachshund\\"). The first units to the equipped with the Bassotto were the DCI and DCII groups of the 235th Semoventi Artillery Regiment of the 135¬™ Armored Division \\"Ariete II\\". Each group received twelve units, which were used in the defense of Rome in the days following the armistice of Cassibile that went into effect on 8 and 9 September 1943. They acquitted themselves well in combat. Following the Italian surrender, the Germans, who regarded the Semovente 105/25 \\"Bassotto\\" as a very good vehicle, captured them and built an additional 91 units, renamed StuG M43 mit 105/25 853 (i) and used them against the Anglo-American forces. The 105/25 cannon was also used in bunkers in the defensive fortifications of the Vallo Alpino.  Features  The Bassotto, modeled on the general design of the M41 and M42 predecessors, consisted of one M43 hull, i.e. the hull of a M15/42 tank widened and lowered, with redesigned front and side plates that were welded instead of bolted. On the hull was placed a fixed casemate bolted and welded with an Ansaldo 105/25 howitzer, with traverse and elevation up to 34 ¬∞ -12 ¬∞ to + 22 ¬∞. The main armament was complemented with a Breda 38 8 mm machine gun for close and anti-aircraft defense operated by the commander / gunner, while the radio operator had one Magneti Marelli radio RF1 CA.  Versions   Semovente M43 da 75/34  Designed by Ansaldo, this version mounted the 75/34 Mod. S.F. gun used on the semovente 75/34 M42M. It was designated StuG M43 mit 75/34 (851) (i) by the Germans. It was manufactured in only twenty-three and twenty-nine units in 1944 and was only employed by the German army.  Semovente M43 da 75/46  Developed by Ansaldo in 1944 and designated StuG M43 mit 75/46 (852) (i) by the Germans, it was a tank destroyer version based on heavily modified hull of M.43 105/25. It was the last tank destroyer manufactured in Italy after the armistice, as well as being the first Italian AFV with a predominantly welded construction and not bolted. Using alternative materials (concrete reinforced with gravel) was also considered for integration with the armor, but instead it was built conventionally with thicker armor (up front 100 mm) compared to other tanks produced in Italy. The armament consisted of a re-purposed antiaircraft gun, the 75/46 C.A. Mod. 1934 / Mod. 40, with a load of forty two rounds. Designers did not have time to develop a specialized antitank round, so they employed a normal delayed fuze to improve the penetration capability. The gun laying was manual on a spherical support and allows elevation from -12 ¬∞ to + 22 ¬∞ and a 34 ¬∞ lateral tilt. The armament also included a Breda 38 machine gun with 500 rounds, which was in practice often replaced by a MG 42 with a greater number of rounds. The crew was limited to just three people, leaving a heavy load to the commander acting as gunner, while the loader was also gunner / radio operator. The Semovente was produced in eleven units (eight in 1943, three in 1944) and only used by the German army. One or two additional vehicles were incomplete or perhaps were completed after the liberation of Italy that prevented the restart of the manufacture planned for 1945.

It is one of the most important monuments of Middle Byzantine architecture and art, and has been listed on UNESCO's World Heritage Sites, along with the monasteries of Nea Moni and Daphnion.  History  The monastery of Hosios Loukas is situated at a scenic site on the slopes of Mount Helicon. It was founded in the early 10th century AD by the hermit, Venerable (Greek: Hosios) Luke of Steiris (Greek: Lukas), whose relics are kept in the monastery to this day. St Luke (not to be confused with the Evangelist author of the Gospel of Saint Luke), was a hermit who died on 7 February 953. He is famous for having predicted the conquest of Crete by Emperor Romanos. It was unclear if he was referring to Romanos I, the emperor at the time. However the island was actually reconquered by Nicephorus Phocas under Romanos II. It is believed that it was during the latter's reign (959-963) that the monastery's Church of the Theotokos (Panagia) was constructed. The main shrine of the monastery is the tomb of St. Luke, originally situated in the vault, but later placed at the juncture of the two churches. The monastery derived its wealth (including funds required for construction) from the fact that the relics of St. Luke were said to have exuded myron, a sort of perfumed oil which produced healing miracles. Pilgrims hoping for miraculous help were encouraged to sleep by the side of the tomb in order to be healed by incubation. The mosaics around the tomb represent not only St. Luke himself, but also hegumen Philotheos offering a likeness of the newly built church to the saint.  Architecture  Exterior view Interior The Hosios Loukas, the oldest in the complex, is the only church known with certainty to have been built in the tenth century in its site in mainland Greece.Rosemary Morris. Monks and Laymen in Byzantium, 843-1118. Cambridge University Press, 1995. . Page 27. This centralized parallelogram-shaped building is the oldest example of the cross-in-square type in the country; its plan closely follows that of Lips Monastery in Constantinople. The walls are opus mixtum (part brick, part stone, part marble) and display curious pseudo- kufic patterns. The Hosios Loukas adjoins a larger cathedral church, or Katholikon, tentatively dated to 1011-12. The Katholikon is the earliest extant domed-octagon church, with eight piers arranged around the perimeter of the naos (nave). The hemispherical dome (without a drum) rests upon four squinches which make a transition from the octagonal base under the dome to the square defined by the walls below.Linda Safran. Heaven on Earth: Art and the Church in Byzantium. . Page 127. The main cube of the church is surrounded by galleries and chapels on all four sides.  Decoration  Virgin with child mosaic Hosios Loukas is the largest of three monasteries surviving from the Middle Byzantine period in Greece. It differs from the Daphnion and Nea Moni in that it is dedicated to a single military saint. St. Lukes' prophecy about the reconquest of Crete is commemorated by the image of Joshua on the exterior wall of the Panagia church: Joshua was considered a model \\"warrior of the faith\\", whose help was especially effective in the wars waged against the Arabs. The Katholikon contains the best preserved complex of mosaics from the period of the Macedonian Renaissance. However, the complex is not complete: the original image of Christ Pantocrator inside the dome is missing, as are the figures of archangels normally placed between the upper windows. There is evidence that the monastery was reputed all over Byzantium for its lavish decoration, liberally applied to all surfaces. Apart from revetment, carving, gold and silver plate, murals, and mosaics (especially imposing on curving surfaces), the interior featured a choice assortment of icons, chandeliers, silk curtains, and altar cloths. Only a fraction of these items are still in situ, most notably colored marble facings and window grilles. Notwithstanding the losses, the Katholikon \\"gives the best impression available anywhere today of the character of a church interior in the first centuries after the end of Iconoclasm\\".Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture (ed. by Dan Cruickshank). Architectural Press, 1996. . Page 310.  The Burial Crypt  Beneath the great domed Katholikon is a burial crypt, accessible only by a stairwell on the southern side. The crypt has three distinct areas: the entrance way; the main interior space which includes nine groin-vaulted bays and a sanctuary with a vaulted bay and an apse; and three vaulted passages, referred to formerly as bone vaults. The crypt‚Äôs frescoes were until recently covered in hundreds of years of dust and hidden but in the 1960s the crypt underwent a cleaning by the Greek Archaeological Service which revealed their remarkably well preserved state with the exceptions of the apse which has lost most of its plaster exposing brick and stone, as well as the entrance vault and groin vaults which have suffered slight damage from water seepage and minor vandalism, mostly on the lower lunettes near the entrance. The crypt contains frescoes on the entryway and its vault, eight lunettes around the walls with depictions of Christ‚Äôs Passion and Resurrection, and forty medallion portraits of apostles, martyrs and holy men, abbots including Philotheos, as well as numerous inscriptions. C.L. Connor claims it has \\"the most complete programme of wall paintings surviving from the Middle Byzantine period.\\" It is believed that most if not all of the crypt frescoes were painted after 1048 AD and the death of Theodore Leobachus, a wealthy, government elite believed to have been one of the prominent patrons and who later in life became the abbot of Hosios Loukas. The sanctuary of the crypt contains a prosthesis niche, an altar, and a chancel barrier which all indicate that the Eucharist was likely celebrated here as part of the services of burial and commemoration of revered religious figures, or as part of the ceremonies relating to the healing cult of Saint Luke. When Hosios Loukas was frequented by pilgrims or members of Saint Luke‚Äôs healing cult, visitors would sleep not only in the Katholikon, but in the crypt itself where the tomb was kept along with two others, believed to be abbots. Saint Luke was believed to have been a miraculous healer, levitator, miraculous feeder and prophesier during his lifetime; after his death, all of the miracles associated with him involved the healing power of his tomb. Connor says that accounts in The Vita of St. Luke, written by an anonymous monk, indicate that ‚Äúhealing agents‚Äù associated with the tomb include but are not limited to exposure to ‚Äúoil from the lamp above the tomb, moisture exuded from the tomb, and dreams experienced when sleeping near the tomb in the practice called incubation.‚Äù The tomb was frequented before and after the completion of the complex, but following completion it became the focal point of the miracle cult of Saint Luke. There is evidence that some wishing for miracles stayed for periods of up to six days near the tomb or in adjacent rooms.

Ticozzi cites his birth as ca. 1480. Biography He was born in Ferrara. He was baptized Giovanni Battista Benvenuti, and he was called L'Ortolano because his father, Francisco, was a gardener. Of his career little is known, save that he was a diligent student of the works of Raphael and Bagnacavallo in 1512‚Äì1513 in Bologna. He painted in the style of Dosso Dossi. For the church of San Niccol√≥ he painted in 1520 the Virgin Mary and Infant Jesus with several Saints; for Santa Maria de' Servi the Nativity and in San Lorenzo, the Adoration of the Magi. From 1512 to 1524 he worked at Ferrara. His masterpiece, a picture of rich colour and fine draughtsmanship, representing Saint Sebastian, Saint Roch and Saint Demetrius, is in the National Gallery, London. It was brought from the church of Bondeno near Ferrara in 1844, and purchased by the gallery in 1861. In the cathedral at Ferrara are other works attributed to him, which later critics have given to Il Garofalo, but in some of the smaller churches of Ferrara, those of San Niccol√≤, the Servi and San Lorenzo, there are pictures which may be readily accepted as his. In the Ferrara Gallery there are a Nativity and a Christ in the Garden . There is a Judith displaying head of Holofernes in the Cathedral of Arezzo and a Death of St. Chrysologos at the Ravenna Cathedral.

The Festival's origins date back to 1963. In the beginning it was an initiative of the City Council of Gij√≥n in co-operation with Caja de Ahorros de Asturias (Cajastur). Both entities co-operate with the Festival, the first as organizer and the second as sponsor. The first year it was held it was called Certamen Internacional de Cine y TV Infantil (International Children's cinema and TV contest). Between 1964 and 1968 it still kept the same name, only the last part, ‚Äúchildren's‚Äù, was substituted by ‚Äúfor children‚Äù. Between 1969-1976 this last part stopped appearing in the Festival's name. From 1977 till 1978 it received the name Certamen Internacional de Cine para la Infancia y la Juventud (International Cinema Contest for Children and Teens). Although in 1986 the Festival began to put the text Gij√≥n International Film Festival in front of its name, it was not until 1988 that it officially adopted this name. Every year the Festival appoints a Young Jury made up of teens between 17‚Äì25 years among those, who request it. The present director, Alejandro D√≠az Casta√±o, was elected in 2017 after a public tender to replace Nacho Carballo. On May 1996 the Entidad Mercantil Art√≠stico-Musical Teatro Municipal Jovellanos de Gij√≥n, S.A., body in charge of the organization of the event together with the City Council, was founded, and changed its name later into Divertia S.A.. This institution is in charge of the theatre's running, the festivities department and the organization of the Film Festival. Throughout the years, some of the most prestigious professionals in independent filmmaking have attended the festival, such as Abbas Kiarostami, Aki Kaurism√§ki, Todd Haynes, Pedro Costa, Paul Schrader, Jo√£o C√©sar Monteiro, Seijun Suzuki, Jem Cohen, Kenneth Anger, Ulrich Seidl, Hal Hartley, Lukas Moodysson, Tsai Ming-liang, Claire Denis, Todd Solondz, Bertrand Bonello, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Whit Stillman, Eug√®ne Green or Philippe Garrel. Among the festival's national and international guests, either as members of the International Jury or presenting their films in the various sections of the festival, are John Cale, Maria Schneider, Monte Hellman, Nicolas Winding Refn, Darren Aronofsky, V√≠ctor Erice, Isabel Coixet or Carla Sim√≥n. Gij√≥n International Film Festival comprises also a series of events, such as courses, panel discussions, q&a;‚Äôs and daily concerts, as well as live music parties. Since 2017, it organizes a series of activities for professionals, under the name of FICX Industry Days. The festival awards various prizes in its competitive sections and collaborates in other initiatives with an aim to promote Asturian filmmaking industry. Said awards are decided upon by an International Jury (made up of at least 5 professionals from different countries), a Young Jury (50 young people between 17 and 26 years of age) and, since 2005, a FIPRESCI jury.

Career Europe Crayton started his career playing for St. Joseph Warriors in Liberia before moving to his first Swiss club, Lucerne, in 1997. He left the club in 1998 to spend two seasons at Grasshoppers Z√ºrich until 2000 before going on to spend one half-season apiece at FC Schaffhausen and FC Wangen bei Olten in 2000 and 2001. He then moved to YF Juventus and spent the 2001‚Äì02 season with the club before going on to spend the 2002‚Äì03 season at Zug. In the summer of 2003, he moved to Concordia Basel, and spent two seasons with the club before joining their cross-town rivals FC Basel in July 2005. However, he spent his first season with Basel on the bench as a backup for their first-choice keeper at the time, Pascal Zuberb√ºhler, who played in all of the club's competitive matches that season. Crayton finally made his competitive debut for Basel in July 2006, when he made two appearances in both Swiss Super League and UEFA Cup qualification. He also played one match in the UEFA Cup group stage in November 2006 due to a red- card suspension of the first-choice keeper Franco Costanzo. North America On 7 August 2008, Basel announced they were allowing Crayton to move to Major League Soccer, and on 15 August 2008 Crayton had signed with D.C. United. He made his first start against Chicago Fire on 16 August 2008, and secured his first MLS shutout in the process. During the 2009 season, Crayton has been caught in a three-way competition with Josh Wicks and Milos Kocic for the starting goalkeeper position for United. It appeared that Crayton would get the starting spot in goal for the 2009 season however a hip injury along with Crayton's high salary proved to much for DC which resulted in Crayton's contract to be terminated. In the winter/spring of 2010 Crayton tried out with the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer but was eventually released. On 16 March 2010 the new expansion NASL team, NSC Minnesota Stars announced that they had signed Crayton to a 1-year deal. Crayton made his debut for the team in its opening game of the 2010 season against the Vancouver Whitecaps, but suffered a serious season-ending knee injury just minutes into the game. International Crayton made his international debut for Liberia in a 2000 African Cup of Nations qualifying match against Tunisia. Crayton went on to represent his country 36 times, often serving as captain, before announcing his retirement from international play in May 2008. In addition to his national team appearances, Crayton has also played in two FIFA World All-Star games, in South Africa in 1999, and in Hong Kong in 2008. Personal life Having spent so much time playing for various clubs in Switzerland between 1997 and 2008, Crayton now also holds Swiss citizenship.

It was originally transmitted on 17 November 1972. Plot Mr. Mainwaring is organising a drinks party at his house, in spite of his wife's fears that he and his men will \\"get drunk and smash the house up\\". He informs Wilson he may call him George at the party, something Wilson takes great delight in. However he sternly tells him he cannot call him \\"George\\" during work hours and turns down Mr. Pike's request to call him \\"George\\" at the party. The party starts off with Jones' section in attendance and clearly very uncomfortable. The stilted conversation remains until the arrival of Walker, with his girlfriend Shirley, which immediately throws George off kilter. He serves them a small amount of beer and sandwiches, which they quickly wolf down, after which George gives them a guided tour of the room, while Walker gets down to business with Shirley on the sofa. Much excitement is generated by the imminent arrival of Mrs Mainwaring, but an air raid warning sees her scurrying to the shelter before being introduced or even being seen by any of the platoon members (or audience). Mr. Hodges arrives, and a few moments later bombs land on the allotments, the taxi garage and the bank. Alarmed, Mr. Mainwaring and his men hurry round to the bank to salvage the money. They secure it and carry it back to the church hall where they begin counting it. After a very long night, they eventually total it up. They then attempt to carry it to Eastgate using a horse and cart supplied by Walker and their own bicycles. A short way into the journey, the money starts blowing out of the hamper used to carry it. Trying to alert Mainwaring's attention to this, Pike fires his rifle, only to frighten the horse and send it charging off into a field with the platoon following close behind on their bikes.

She at last seems about to appear, we hear her footsteps, then she runs off when the siren sounds. As Fraser puts it \\"we'll never see her now\\". #In this episode, Mainwaring attempts to hide his lower- class background by claiming his father was a member of \\"the Master Tailors' Guild\\"; when he leaves the room, Jones disdains Mainwaring's claims by revealing that Mainwaring's late father was not a tailor, merely a draper with a small business in a side-alley and sold poor quality workman's trousers. Mainwaring's profligate brother, Barry, confirms this fact in the episode My Brother and I.

The Seoul campus is located in the southeastern part of Seoul, near the Han River, and is served by a metro station of the same name. The Seoul campus has 13 undergraduate colleges and 13 graduate schools, whereas the Glocal Campus in Chungju is composed of 7 undergraduate colleges and 2 graduate schools. Currently, 23,000 students are attending the 238,980m¬≤ Seoul campus and 15,500 students attending the 31,763m¬≤ Global Campus in Chungju, which is about an hour away from the Seoul Campus. History Konkuk University was founded in 1931 by Dr. Yoo Seok- Chang, who founded the Minjung Hospital, based on the three virtues‚Äîsincerity, fidelity and righteousness as the founding principle of an establishment. In May 1946, Konkuk University was established as Chosun School of Politics ( / ), a junior college for future political leaders, by Dr. Yoo Seok-chang. Thirteen years later, the school became a ‚Äúcomprehensive university‚Äù and changed its name to Konkuk (, meaning ‚Äúfounding a nation‚Äù). As strong believers in the role of higher education in maintaining Korea's sovereignty, the founder and his supporters chose the name in the hopes that Konkuk graduates would build and serve the nation. Dr. Yoo, whose pen name was Sanghuh, was raised by a father who moved to Manchuria to join the Korean independence movement. Trained as a medical doctor during the Japanese occupation, Dr. Yoo initially had opened the People's Hospital in 1931 to provide medical care to less fortunate Koreans. Before long, he turned his attention to young leaders in rural areas since agriculture was the main pillar of the economy. Dr. Yoo and his supporters, who would later become benefactors of Konkuk University, aimed to open a higher education institution for leaders who would enlighten the rural population. Opposed by the Japanese, the reform-minded group managed a private organization and developed their ideas for a little more than a decade. With years of experience in rural reforms and education as well as a short stint as a politician, Dr. Yoo became convinced that Konkuk University's must set its goals beyond academic excellence. During his tenure as the president of Konkuk University and the chairman of the Konkuk University Foundation, he emphasized three virtues‚Äîsincerity, fidelity, and righteousness‚Äîwhich continues to guide Konkuk to this day. In addition, Dr. Yoo was aware that the limited space would not be sufficient to provide future agricultural leaders with ample hands-on experience. Despite the severe financial difficulties and skepticism after the Korean War, he boldly executed a move to the current location in Seoul. Thanks to Dr. Yoo's generous endowment and education philosophy, Konkuk University not only leads in agricultural and life science research, but also excels in many other areas today. Furthermore, Konkuk University has undergone major transformations in the past decade, earning the title of ‚Äúthe fastest growing university in Korea.‚Äù In 2016, Konkuk University celebrated its 70th anniversary. A new emblem with the Sanghuh Hall, the original building for the Chosun School of Politics, was released in December 2015. The university also unveiled a second ox statue and held a major academic symposium. In 2017, Konkuk University was selected for the Leaders in Industry-University Cooperation (LINC+) project by the Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation of Korea and has been accredited by the Korean University Accreditation Institute (KUAI), Korean Council for University Education, for two consecutive periods. Administration and organization Founder Dr. Seok- chang Yoo served as the first president of Konkuk University from 1959 to 1961, and Dr. Sanggi Min became the university's 20th president in September 2016. In addition to the president, Konkuk University has four executive vice presidents‚Äîprovost and executive vice president for academic affairs, executive vice president for public affairs, executive vice president for research, and executive vice president for medicine. The board of Konkuk University Foundation, which includes Chairperson Ja-eun Yoo and eleven board members serving 4-year terms, govern the university.

He achieved success with the song \\"Zalim\\" in 2004. Early life H√ºseyin Yalƒ±n was born on 30 March 1980 in Ni≈üanta≈üƒ±, Istanbul, as the son of Figen and Kamil Yalƒ±n. He went to primary school at Atak√∂y, Bakƒ±rk√∂y. Journalist Ferai Tƒ±n√ß is his uncle.  Music career   Career beginnings  Yalƒ±n soon started to write songs and eventually collaborated with Kargo's guitarist Selim √ñzt√ºrk to produce an album. Selim √ñzt√ºrk produced the album, while Kargo's other members Serkan √áelik√∂z and Burak Karata≈ü served as keyboarder and drummer respectively. Yalƒ±n wrote all of the songs for his first album and Ellerine Saƒülƒ±k was eventually released in March 2004 under the label Universal Music. The album's lead single \\"Zalim\\" became a hit in Turkey, and the album sold 200,000 copies in one week. Ebru √áapa of H√ºrriyet praised the song's composition and lyrics in her review for the newspaper. By the end of the month, it sold 300,000 copies. The number rose to 500,000 within four months of its release. As a result, it ranked number 4 on Universal Music's list of best-selling albums after Guns N' Roses. M√ú-YAP also recognized it as one of the \\"Best-selling albums of the year\\". The album was favorably received on digital platforms and broke a record at the time with 1 million and 700 thousands downloads. As a result, Yalƒ±n earned 2 million dollars with the success of his album on digital platforms. After releasing a music video for \\"Zalim\\", he subsequently recorded and released separate music videos for \\"Sonsuz Ol\\" and \\"G√ºnaydƒ±n\\", the third of which ranked MTV World Chart Express program, and entered the musical charts of Bulgaria and Greek. At the Turkey Music Awards, Yalƒ±n was chosen as the \\"Best Male Newcomer\\" and his song \\"Zalim\\", was covered by the Albanian singer Rovena Stefa and Bulgarian singer Toni Storaro under the titles \\"Zemer\\" and \\"Greshnica\\" respectively. The song was translated to numerous languages including Greek, Russian, Serbian and Arabic. The song \\"Deƒümez\\" from his album, was rearranged by one of Universal Music's producers Martin Kierszenbaum to be used on Japanese singer Ai's album What's Goin' On Ai. In 2006, Yalƒ±n collaborated with Ai and American reggae artist Shaggy on Ai's album What's Goin' On Ai with the track \\"Famous feat. Shaggy and Yalƒ±n\\". The judges on NTV's musical program chose Ellerine Saƒülƒ±k as the tenth best album of the past decade in Turkey. After the success of the album, Yalƒ±n went on a tour and gave concerts in Cemil Topuzlu Open-Air Theatre and Rumelihisarƒ± in Istanbul, followed by about 40 performances across Turkey and Europe.  Subsequent career  While being on tour after the success of Ellerine Saƒülƒ±k, in December 2004 Yalƒ±n started working on his second studio album. Due to Universal Music's closure in Turkey the promotions for his first album stopped, and to be able to continue with his second album's preparations, he signed a contract with Pasaj M√ºzik. The first song from the album to get a music video was \\"K√º√ß√ºc√ºƒü√ºm\\" followed by \\"Bir Bakmƒ±≈üsƒ±n\\" and \\"Ben Bilmem\\". The fourth music video was made for \\"Ke≈üke\\" which in Yalƒ±n's words was \\"The best song I've ever made.\\" The album's lead single \\"K√º√ß√ºc√ºƒü√ºm\\" was awarded as the \\"Best Song of the Year\\" by POPSAV. A remix of \\"K√º√ß√ºc√ºƒü√ºm\\" by Volga Tam√∂z was later released in September 2005. Bir Bakmƒ±≈üsƒ±n became one of the best-selling albums of 2006, and M√ú-YAP gave the album a gold certification. Yalƒ±n's third studio album Her ≈ûey Sensin was released under the label Avrupa M√ºzik in March 2007. All of the songs were written by Yalƒ±n himself and he worked with Egyptian percussionist Hossam Ramzy, American guitarist Tim Pierce, who has been on the albums of many artists (including Michael Jackson, Bon Jovi, Eric Clapton, Shakira, Christina Aguilera), and American bass player Matt Bissonette, who had previously worked with Ringo Starr. Within 20 days of its release, the album sold 110,000 copies. As one of the \\"Best-selling albums of the year\\" it received a gold certificate from M√ú-YAP. Cemil Aƒüacƒ±koƒülu directed the music video for \\"Her ≈ûey Sensin\\". Subsequently two other music videos were released for the songs \\"Cumhuriyet\\" and \\"Kalamadƒ±m\\". \\"Cumhuriyet\\" was also well-received by fans and critics. After a short break, in 2009 he release his new album Ben Bug√ºn. All of the songs were written by Yalƒ±n and arranged by Alper Erin√ß. The photographs for the album were shot by Mehmet Turgut. Yalƒ±n's total album sales at the time was 1 million, earning him a total of 6 million dollars. Yalƒ±n who had released four albums over the course of 5 years, waited until June 2012 to release his new single \\"Anlat G√ºzel Mi Oralar\\". The song was written by Yalƒ±n, and produced by Avrupa M√ºzik, and Ozan √áolakoƒülu served as the arranger.  Other works  Yalƒ±n has also been involved in a series of commercials for Vestel. Yalƒ±n played the role of a famous figure who embellished the dreams of a little girl, played by 9-year- old Alara Baƒücƒ±. In this series of Vestel's commercials with the theme of \\"friendly technology\\", the brand's mascot Vestrons also made an appearance. In May 2013, Azeri singer El√ßin Ceferov released the music video for his song \\"Bana onu √ßaƒüƒ±rƒ±n gelsin\\" which was inspired by Yalƒ±n's music video \\"Ah Be Karde≈üim\\".

Tsiang. Early life and education Tsiang was born in Shaoyang in Hunan Province. Tsiang's education from his teenage years had been Western and largely Christian, and he converted to Christianity at 11. Having been urged to study in the US by his teacher from a missionary school, he was sent in 1911 to study in the United States, where he attended the Park Academy, Oberlin College and Columbia University. His dissertation, \\"Labor and Empire: A Study of the Reaction of British Labor, Mainly as Represented in Parliament, to British Imperialism Since 1880,\\" led him into issues in the relation of foreign relations and domestic politics, which would structure his scholarship after he returned to China. After obtaining a Ph.D., he returned to China in 1923, where he took up a position at Nankai University and then at Tsinghua University. Academic career Hu Shih (right) and Tsiang (left)At Tsinghua, Tsiang became the head of the History Department, where he edited and published a number of works on Chinese history and edited the English-language journal Chinese Social and Political Science Review. Using newly-opened Qing dynasty archives and diplomatic publications, Tsiang argued that China should adopt Western approaches if it wanted to score diplomatic victories. Tsiang blamed China's unequal treatment by Western powers after the First Opium War (1839‚Äì42) on Chinese unequal treatment of Western powers before the war. During his tenure at Tsinghua, he mentored a number of historians in the study of Qing history, including John K. Fairbank.\\"T.F. Tsiang and Modernization,\\" John King Fairbank, China Bound: A Fifty Year Memoir (New York: Harper & Row, 1982), 85-93 Diplomatic career Following mounting tensions in China's relations with Japan, Tsiang left academia in 1935 and joined the Chinese Nationalist government, which he served in many different capacities throughout the Sino-Japanese War. In 1945, Tsiang became the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations, and he also served as the ambassador of China to the United States. Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland, Tsiang defended the exclusive right of the Taipei-based Republic of China to represent China in the United Nations and in the Security Council.

He has been an active leader in the shaping of the Palestinian liberation theology. He was the first to articulate a Palestinian theology of liberation in his book, Justice, and only Justice, a Palestinian Theology of Liberation, published by Orbis in 1989, and based on his dissertation for his degree in theology. The book laid the foundation of a theology that addresses the conflict over Palestine and explores the political as well as the religious, biblical, and theological dimensions. A former Canon of St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem, he lectures widely both at home and abroad. His book, A Palestinian Christian Cry for Reconciliation, was published by Orbis in 2008, followed by A Palestinian Theology of Liberation, 2017. Early life and education Born in 1937 in the Palestinian village of Beisan, Ateek moved with his family to Nazareth in 1948. He has said that Beisan (also known as Beth Shean) was destroyed by Israeli forces, turning his family into refugees. He was ordained as a priest in the Anglican Communion in 1967. He holds degrees from Hardin-Simmons University in Texas and the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in California. In addition, he received a Doctor of Divinity degree from the San Francisco Theological Seminary in California in 1985. Ateek earned his BA degree from Hardin-Simmons University, Abilene, Texas, in 1963, and his Master of Divinity degree in 1966 from the Church Divinity School of the Pacific (CDSP), Berkeley, California. In 1985 he completed his doctoral studies at San Francisco Theological Seminary. Ateek has also received honorary Doctors of Divinity from the Church Divinity School of the Pacific, Berkeley, California, and the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and the distinguished alumni award from San Francisco Theological Seminary. In 2006, Ateek received the Sayre award from the Episcopal Peace Fellowship USA. Career Ateek served as Canon of St. George's Cathedral in Jerusalem and as parish priest in Haifa and Nazareth. In 1991 he founded the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center in Jerusalem. The Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center The Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center (also known simply as Sabeel), headquartered in Jerusalem, describes itself as \\"an ecumenical grassroots liberation theology movement among Palestinian Christians\\", which \\"encourages Christians from around the world to work for justice and to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people\\". One source traces the founding of Sabeel to a 1989 meeting at which \\"an ecumenical ad hoc committee of ten clergy and lay theologians\\" discusses \\"ways of fostering liberation theology among Palestinian Christians\\". The meeting led to an international conference in March 1990, organized with the help of the Mennonite Central Committee, which in turn led to the 1991 book Faith and the Intifada, co-edited by Ateek. These developments culminated in the 1994 founding of Sabeel, which held an international conference in 1996, leading to the creation of Friends of Sabeel. Sabeel's stated vision is \\"to make the gospel relevant ecumenically and spiritually in the lives of the local indigenous Church.... following in the footsteps of Christ means standing for the oppressed, working for justice, and seeking peace-building opportunities, and it challenges us to empower local Christians.\\" Sabeel preaches a Palestinian liberation theology, which \\"hopes to connect the true meaning of Christian faith with the daily lives of all those who suffer under occupation, violence, discrimination, and human rights violations. Friends of Sabeel ‚Äì North America's (FOSNA) states: \\"Liberation theologies recognize that faith addresses the whole of personal and social life from a faith perspective. Thus a Palestinian liberation theology necessarily addresses the political and social systems that are obstructing justice and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians and seeks to change those toward social and political patterns that will express just relationships.\\" In a page devoted to Palestinian Liberation Theology, FOSNA states that the theology has \\"10 characteristics\\", among which are the following: it is \\"contextual\\", \\"ecumenical\\", \\"interfaith\\", \\"a theology of non-violence\\", \\"not identified with any one political party\\", and a critic of Christian Zionism.Palestinian Liberation Theology, from fosna.org, January 24, 2014 Theology Disagreement with Zionist interpretations of the Old Testament Ateek outlined his disagreement with what he sees as Zionist interpretations of the Old Testament in his 1989 book, Justice, and Only Justice: A Palestinian Theology of Liberation: > \\"Before the creation of the State [of Israel], the Old Testament was > considered to be an essential part of Christian Scripture, pointing and > witnessing to Jesus. Since the creation of the State, some Jewish and > Christian interpreters have read the Old Testament largely as a Zionist text > to such an extent that it has become almost repugnant to Palestinian > Christians [‚Ä¶] The fundamental question of many Christians, whether uttered > or not, is: How can the Old Testament be the Word of God in light of the > Palestinian Christians' experience with its use to support Zionism?. Ateek's internal struggle with the Israel issue In the book, Ateek also explained how he struggled to reconcile various dichotomies posed by his faith, beliefs and identity: > \\"As a boy, remembering my family's harsh exile from Beisan, and later, as a > person of faith and a clergyman, my own struggles with hate, anger, and > humiliation were not easy. But these feelings had to be challenged > continuously by the demands of love and forgiveness. At the same time, I > knew without a doubt that injustice is sinful and evil; that it is an > outrage against God; and that it is my duty to cry out against it. It has > taken me years to accept the establishment of the State of Israel and its > need- although not its right - to exist. I now feel that I want it to stay, > because I believe that the elimination of Israel would mean greater > injustice to millions of innocent people who know no home except Israel. > This does not suggest that the Old Testament is not the Word of God, but how > can it be understood as that if a Zionist theology of the Old Testament is > accepted by Christian groups?\\" Views regarding Palestine and the Israeli occupation Views on Israel and Zionism In 1989, in Justice, and Only Justice, Ateek wrote, \\"The preservation of Israel as a Jewish state is important not only to Israeli Jews but to Jews all over the world. I believe that we must honor their wish and accept it. In fact, the Palestinians should eventually guarantee the survival of Israel by accepting it as a Jewish state\\" (166). In 2013, Friends of Sabeel ‚Äì North America's website FAQ answered the question, \\"Does FOSNA support the existence of Israel as a Jewish state?\\" as follows: > This question is rooted in a presupposition, which needs to be carefully > examined: that the State of Israel can only exist as a Jewish state, that > is, as a state in which Jews are the overwhelming demographic majority and > only Jews have full citizenship. Although Palestinians are 20 percent of the > Israeli population today, they are relegated to second-class citizenship, > lacking many rights and privileges enjoyed only by Jewish Israelis. To > declare Israel a \\"Jewish state\\" would mean that this discriminatory > treatment is enshrined as a core value of the state itself. It would also > mean renouncing the internationally recognized right of Palestinian refugees > to return to their homes, which they were forced to leave during the > creation of the state. Lastly, to ask Palestinians to accept Israel as a > Jewish state is like asking Jews, Muslims and other non-Christians to > recognize the U.S. as a \\"Christian state\\". FOSNA's FAQ also addresses the question of support for a two-state solution: > For many years Sabeel and FOSNA supported the \\"two-state solution\\", which > envisioned two neighboring states side by side, with Palestine occupying the > West Bank and Gaza. But since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, Israeli > settlements and their supporting infrastructure have confiscated more than > 40 percent of the land and broken it into dozens of enclaves. As the Israeli > human rights organization B'Tselem states, \\"Israel's dramatic alteration of > the West Bank map has precluded realization of Palestinians' right to self- > determination in a viable Palestinian state.\\" Moreover, many Israeli > political leaders (and the majority of Israeli citizens) have declared their > opposition to a Palestinian state, and those officials who say they support > \\"the two-state solution\\" declare that, at best, a Palestinian state would > have no standing military, no control of its own airspace and no land > bordering on other Arab states. In negotiations, Israel has also refused to > relinquish most of the settlement blocs that have divided the West Bank into > separate entities. With these facts in mind, FOSNA calls for a solution that > provides equality and justice to all residents of the Holy Land, whether > they are ultimately found in one state or two. Kairos Palestine Document In December 2009, Sabeel endorsed the Kairos Palestine Document (KPD), which calls on Christians throughout the world to join the 2005 call of Palestinian civil society to utilize boycotts, divestment, and sanctions to pressure Israel's government to end occupation, human rights violations, and illegal settlement of Palestinian land. The document, whose stated goal is to communicate the truth about the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict to the world, was drafted by a group, among them Patriarch Michel Sabah, Rev. Mitri Raheb, Rifat Odeh Kassis, Rev. Ateek and others. The 2009 \\"Kairos Palestine\\" document has been described as echoing Ateek's own \\"Justice and Only Justice\\". \\"Morally responsible divestment\\" The term \\"morally responsible investment\\" came into widespread use as a result of a 2006 paper by Ateek, \\"A Call for Morally Responsible Investment: A Nonviolent Response to the Occupation\\", which has been described as \\"the central text of the pro- divestment movement\\". \\"The Jerusalem Sabeel Document\\" \\"The Jerusalem Sabeel Document: Principles for a Just Peace in Palestine‚ÄìIsrael\\" is one of the foundational documents of the organization. It calls for \\"one state for two nations and three religions\\". Use of Christian imagery In his 2001 Easter message Ateek stated, in part: > As we approach Holy Week and Easter, the suffering of Jesus Christ at the > hands of evil political and religious powers two thousand years ago is lived > out again in Palestine. The number of innocent Palestinians and Israelis > that have fallen victim to Israeli state policy is increasing. Here in > Palestine Jesus is again walking the via dolorosa. Jesus is the powerless > Palestinian humiliated at a checkpoint, the woman trying to get through to > the hospital for treatment, the young man whose dignity is trampled, the > young student who cannot get to the university to study, the unemployed > father who needs to find bread to feed his family; the list is tragically > getting longer, and Jesus is there in their midst suffering with them. He is > with them when their homes are shelled by tanks and helicopter gunships. He > is with them in their towns and villages, in their pains and sorrows. In > this season of Lent, it seems to many of us that Jesus is on the cross again > with thousands of crucified Palestinians around him. It only takes people of > insight to see the hundreds of thousands of crosses throughout the land, > Palestinian men, women, and children being crucified. Palestine has become > one huge golgotha. The Israeli government crucifixion system is operating > daily. Palestine has become the place of the skull. Using the Gospel story > one can put it in a different and still very poignant way. Four things are > clear today. Jerusalem still does not know what makes for peace; Jesus is > weeping and his tears are mixed with many other people's tears; the number > of people who are carrying their crosses is multiplying phenomenally; and > the women of Palestine as well as many Jewish women are weeping over the > many killed and wounded innocents. This is the reality of life > today.Archives, Sabeel.org, 1996-2011 Condemnation of suicide attacks In a 2003 document on suicide bombings, Ateek condemns suicide attacks but emphasizes they are the result of Israeli occupation. \\"If Israel labels them as terrorists\\", he wrote, \\"they are, after all, the product of its own making.\\" The FOSNA website's FAQ addresses the question of Palestinian violence as follows: \\"FOSNA does not condone any form of violence or terrorism‚ÄîPalestinian, Israeli, American or other. Following the teachings of Sabeel, FOSNA maintains that the primary way to discourage violence is to end conditions of injustice. It insists that all people, Israelis and Palestinians, should live in peace and security but that this is brought about by just relationships, not by repression of one people by another, which foments resistance.\\" Books *Ateek, Naim Stifan: A Palestinian Theology of Liberation, Orbis Books, Maryknoll, New York, 2017 *Ateek, Naim Stifan: A Palestinian Christian Cry for Reconciliation, Orbis Books, Maryknoll, New York, 2008 *Ateek, Naim; Cedar Duaybis; Maurine Tobin (Editors): Challenging Christian Zionism, Melisende, 2005. *Ateek, Naim Stifan: Justice and Only Justice: A Palestinian Theology of Liberation, Orbis Books, Maryknoll, New York, 1989 *Ateek, Naim S.; Marc H.

Exit times and return times are also examples of hitting times. Definitions Let T be an ordered index set such as the natural numbers, N, the non-negative real numbers, [0, +‚àû), or a subset of these; elements t ‚àà T can be thought of as \\"times\\". Given a probability space (Œ©, Œ£, Pr) and a measurable state space S, let X : Œ© √ó T ‚Üí S be a stochastic process, and let A be a measurable subset of the state space S. Then the first hit time œÑA : Œ© ‚Üí [0, +‚àû] is the random variable defined by :\\\\tau_A (\\\\omega) := \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{ t \\\\in T \\\\mid X_t (\\\\omega) \\\\in A \\\\\\\\}. The first exit time (from A) is defined to be the first hit time for S \\\\ A, the complement of A in S. Confusingly, this is also often denoted by œÑA. The first return time is defined to be the first hit time for the singleton set { X0(œâ) }, which is usually a given deterministic element of the state space, such as the origin of the coordinate system. Examples * Any stopping time is a hitting time for a properly chosen process and target set. This follows from the converse of the D√©but theorem (Fischer, 2013). * Let B denote standard Brownian motion on the real line R starting at the origin. Then the hitting time œÑA satisfies the measurability requirements to be a stopping time for every Borel measurable set A ‚äÜ R. * For B as above, let \\\\tau_r (r>0) denote the first exit time for the interval (‚àír, r), i.e. the first hit time for (‚àí‚àû, ‚àír] ‚à™ [r, +‚àû). Then the expected value and variance of \\\\tau_r satisfy ::\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\tau_r \\\\right] = r^2, ::\\\\operatorname{Var} \\\\left[ \\\\tau_r \\\\right] = (2/3) r^4. * For B as above, the time of hitting a single point (different from the starting point 0) has the L√©vy distribution. D√©but theorem The hitting time of a set F is also known as the d√©but of F. The D√©but theorem says that the hitting time of a measurable set F, for a progressively measurable process, is a stopping time. Progressively measurable processes include, in particular, all right and left-continuous adapted processes. The proof that the d√©but is measurable is rather involved and involves properties of analytic sets. The theorem requires the underlying probability space to be complete or, at least, universally complete. The converse of the D√©but theorem states that every stopping time defined with respect to a filtration over a real-valued time index can be represented by a hitting time. In particular, for essentially any such stopping time there exists an adapted, non-increasing process with c√†dl√†g (RCLL) paths that takes the values 0 and 1 only, such that the hitting time of the set \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} by this process is the considered stopping time. The proof is very simple.

It was operated from the outset by the South Devon Railway. Most of the line is now operated as the heritage Dartmouth Steam Railway but the section north of Paignton is part of Great Western Railway's Riviera Line from . History to 1865 Torbay and Dartmouth had considerable commercial importance in the early nineteenth century. In 1844 early proposals were made for a branch from the South Devon Railway (SDR) to Torquay harbour. This failed because of objectors, but in 1845 a separate scheme was proposed for railways from Dartmouth and Brixham to Exeter (via Newton Abbot and Moretonhampstead) to make a junction with a standard gauge line. This inspired the SDR to introduce a bill to parliament in 1846 for a broad gauge line from Aller (near Newton Abbot) to Torquay, Paignton, Brixham and Kingswear. The section beyond Torquay was dropped because of opposition from residents of Paignton and Goodrington who feared loss of access to the beach, also because the SDR was short of funds following the collapse of the atmospheric system on which it had based its propulsion system and the difficulty of reaching its primary goal, Plymouth. The SDR opened its line from Exeter to Newton Abbot (the station was called simply Newton at first) on 31 December 1846, and to a Torquay station (later renamed ) on 18 December 1848. A public meeting in Torquay in 1852 objected strongly to the SDR's idea that an extension be built to Torquay harbour. In 1853, two groups proposed (i) an extension to Torquay harbour and (ii) an extension to Paignton, Brixham and Kingswear with a branch from Livermead to Torquay harbour. However, insufficient capital was raised for either scheme to go ahead. The latter had Isambard Kingdom Brunel as engineer. A further attempt was made to raise interest, this time with Charles Seale- Hayne as Chairman. The loop to Brixham was omitted in this proposal. After a great deal of canvassing and promises of financial support by the directors, and after persuading Brunel to make his estimates low, it was just possible to raise sufficient capital to proceed. The Dartmouth and Torbay Railway Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament of 27 July 1857 to build from the SDR Torquay station to a point between the Higher Ferry and Waterhead Creek at Kingswear, and power to establish a ferry from Kingswear to Dartmouth, and to take over the existing Dartmouth Floating Bridge Company. The course of the Torquay portion of the route proved controversial as it would have used a coastal viaduct at Livermead, but Brunel amended this to a course behind Livermead House, which drew objections from C.H. Mallock of Cockington Court, the landowner. The first section to open was from SDR's Torquay station to Paignton on 2 August 1859. The new Company provided its own Torquay station and the SDR station was renamed 'Torre'. This short section was exceptionally difficult in engineering terms due to the difficult terrain; it included 20 bridges, a viaduct and a tunnel of 133 yards (122 m), at Oil Cove. The next section was from Paignton to Brixham Road (later renamed ). Brunel had died in 1859 so Robert Pearson Brereton was now the engineer. It opened to passengers on 14 March 1861 and to goods on 1 April 1861. This too included difficult engineering: Goodrington Marsh had to be crossed, and four timber viaducts were planned, at Goodrington, Saltern Cove, Broadsands and Hookhills. However, the first two were built as embankments and the last two as masonry viaducts at the same price. The Brixham Road station was about two miles from Brixham, an important fishing port. The Dartmouth & Torbay Railway and the Torbay & Brixham Railway in 1868 At this point, the Company funds were exhausted and a cheaper way of reaching Dartmouth was proposed. This was to build a line to Greenway Quay on the River Dart. The deviation would have had steep gradients of 1 in 56 and a zig-zag requiring the reversal of trains very close to Greenway House and another reversal lower down. Passengers would then have used a steamer to access Dartmouth. The Company pointed out that Greenway could be used at a later date for a jumping off point for a line crossing the river here and proceeding down the right bank of the river to Dartmouth itself. The relevant clauses of the deviation bill were defeated in Parliament, mainly because of objections from Mr. Harvey, the owner of Greenway. The rest of the bill became law by Act of 7 July 1862, authorising an extension of time for completion. The route was returned to the original authorised route to run to Hoodown, later extended to Kingswear on the east bank of the Dart. Construction was delayed while further sources of capital were sought. A major contributor was the formation of the Company directors into the Dartmouth Harbour Commissioners with powers to borrow money to improve the harbour and build a 'tramway' which would complete the line to Kingswear Point. The line was opened from Brixham Road to for passenger traffic on 16 August 1864; goods were not conveyed until 2 April 1866. A steam ferry from Kingswear to Dartmouth was operated from the day of passenger opening. A pier (the '√âclair pier') was built at Kingswear in addition to the ferry pontoon. The pier accommodated a service to the Channel Islands for some years. There was also, briefly, a service to South Africa. An hotel, the 'Plume of Feathers' was modified and renamed the 'Royal Dart' was intended to serve passengers for these and other hoped-for services. This section too was difficult, involving considerable earthworks, a 495 yard (453 m) tunnel, a masonry viaduct near Greenway and three timber viaducts on piles, across Longwood, Noss and Waterhead Creeks. The Company bought a piece of foreshore at Dartmouth, at the end of Spithead (which was then approximately half the length of the present road). A pontoon and bridge were constructed to accommodate the Company's ferry, which ran in connection with most (but not all) train services. A booking office was opened, in the form of a hut on the pontoon. At Kingswear a wharf was built to accommodate the coal traffic for bunkering of ships in the harbour and for the transfer of coal from ships to trains for the Torquay Gas Works. The lengths of the line, all single track, were: * Torre to Paignton: 2 mi 78ch (4.8 km) * Paignton to Brixham Road: 2 mi 72ch (4.7 km) * Brixham Road to Kingswear: 3 mi 63ch (6.1 km). Later history Rebuilt Hookhills Viaduct The line was worked and operated from the outset by the South Devon Railway, and it was leased to them in perpetuity from 1 January 1866. After that time the Company was a financial entity only until 1872, when it was formally absorbed into the SDR. Brixham Road station was a poor facility for the important fishing town of Brixham, and an independent company, the Torbay and Brixham Railway constructed a short line to directly serve Brixham. It opened on 28 February 1868 to passengers, goods traffic being handled from 1 May 1868. The line was 2 miles and 6 chains (3.3 km) long, and joined the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway at Brixham Road station, which was renamed Churston from the day of opening of that line. On 1 February 1876 the South Devon Railway amalgamated with the Great Western Railway and the Bristol and Exeter Railway, forming the new Great Western Railway. As the Dartmouth line was then part of the SDR, it became a part of the GWR. In 1888, agreement was finally obtained between the GWR, the Harbour Commissioners and Dartmouth Borough Council for the completion of the GWR's portion of the new Dartmouth Embankment and the building of a new station. The West of England lines of the GWR, including the lines of the former Dartmouth and Torbay Railway, were converted from the original broad gauge of 7 ft 0¬ºin to what was now standard gauge, 4 ft 8¬Ωin in a huge engineering project over a single weekend, from 20 May 1892 and 23 May 1892. The tunnel at Oil Cove, south of Torquay, was opened out in 1910. It was replaced by the bridge that carries Torbay Road. The two wooden viaducts, Longwood and Noss, a short distance north of Kingswear, were abolished and the line deviated to by-pass them in 1921. In 1928 the timber viaduct at Waterhead Creek was replaced by a double track concrete and steel bridge. After that, it was no longer necessary to change locomotives at Paignton, as the largest locomotives could continue to Kingswear, including those hauling the prestigious Torbay Express. This included the GWR 6000 Class or \\"King\\" class. On 1 November 1972 the line between Goodrington Sands and Kingswear was transferred to private ownership and operated as a heritage railway.

Sherwood Station was incorporated as a village in 1960 and its name was shortened to Sherwood in 1983. The village was amalgamated into the city of Charlottetown on April 1, 1995. Sherwood was largely a farming district, located east of the royalty's common pasture land (present-day Agriculture Canada experimental farm). It bordered Charlottetown and West Royalty on the west, Parkdale on the south, and East Royalty on the east. One of the biggest changes that came to Sherwood occurred in 1938 when a parcel on the northern edge of the community was purchased by the city of Charlottetown to create an airport. The Charlottetown Airport remains a defining landmark in the north-central part of the city and has had a major influence on Sherwood's post-war development. During the 1960s-1990s, much of the remaining farmland in Sherwood was developed in housing projects which resulted in many single-detached homes constructed throughout the area, making Sherwood one of PEI's top-five communities in terms of population.

William of Saint-Thierry (French: Guillaume de Saint-Thierry; Latin: Guillelmus S. Theodorici; 1075/80/85‚Äì1148) was a twelfth-century French Benedictine abbot of Saint-Thierry, theologian and mystic who became a Cistercian monk and writer. Biography William was born at Li√®ge (in present-day Belgium) of a noble family between 1075 and 1080 (or 1085), and died at Signy-l'Abbaye in 1148. He probably studied at the cathedral school in Reims, though some have argued it was at Laon, prior to his profession as a Benedictine monk. He became a monk with his brother Simon at the monastery of St. Nicaise, also in Reims, sometime after 1111. From here both eventually became abbots of other Benedictine abbeys: Simon at the abbey of Saint-Nicolas-au-Bois, in the Diocese of Laon, and William at Saint- Thierry, on a hill overlooking Reims, in 1119.D√©gert, Antoine. \\"William of St- Thierry.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 6 Jun. 2013 In 1118 William met St. Bernard, abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Clairvaux, where they formed an intimate friendship that lasted for life. His greatest desire was to move to Clairvaux and profess as a Cistercian, but Bernard disapproved of the plan and imposed on him the responsibility of remaining in charge of the abbey at St. Thierry as a Benedictine. Their friendship, however, grew stronger while Bernard lay in the infirmary of Clairvaux convalescing after an illness in 1125. William was instrumental in the first General Chapter meeting of the Benedictine abbots in the Diocese of Reims, in 1131, and it is possible that he hosted the chapter meeting at Saint-Thierry. After the second General Chapter of the Benedictines, held at Soissons in 1132, where many Cistercian reforms were adopted by the Benedictines, William submitted his Responsio abbatum (\\"Response of the Abbots\\") to Cardinal Matthew -- papal legate in the diocese and critic of the abbots' reforms -- successfully defending their reformation efforts. On account of long infirmities and a lifelong desire for a life of contemplation, William resigned his abbacy in 1135 and entered the newly established Cistercian Signy Abbey, also in the diocese of Reims. He did not venture to retire to Clairvaux lest his friend Bernard refuse to accept his abdication. There he divided his free time between prayer, study, and writing. According to a contemporary, his death occurred in 1148, about the time of the council held at Reims under Pope Eugenius. The necrology of Signy dates it 8 September, a few years prior to his good friend Bernard's death in 1153. Writings William wrote throughout all of his abbatial career as a Benedictine and his final years as a Cistercian monk. His earliest works reflect a monk seeking God continually and investigating the various and best ways of furthering the soul's ascent to God in spiritual union, William's ultimate goal. When read chronologically, one can discern the development and evolution of William's thought. Toward the end of his career, having written extensively on spiritual life and especially on the moral interpretation of the biblical Song of Songs, William came across the writings of Peter Abelard, whose Trinitarian theology and especially Christology William found to be in error and dangerous to Christian faith. He wrote his own work against Abelard and alerted others about these concerns, urging St. Bernard to act. As a result, Abelard was condemned by the Council of Sens in 1140 or 1141. William wrote against what he saw as errors in the writings of William of Conches concerning Trinitarian theology and also against Rupert of Deutz on sacramental theology. Besides his letters to St. Bernard and others, William wrote several works, some of which he himself enumerates, though somewhat incorrectly. In total, there were twenty two works by William (twenty one extant), all written in Latin between c. 1121 and 1148. In approximate chronological order, these include: *De contemplando Deo (On Contemplating God) in 1121-1124. This is sometimes paired with De natura et dignitate amoris (below) under the title Liber solioquiorum sancti Bernardi.PL 184:365-80. A critical edition is Jacque Hourlier, Guillaume de Saint-Thierry: La contemplation de Dieu. L'Oraison de Dom Guillaume, (Sources Chretiennes 61).

Three of William's writings were widely read in the later Middle Ages. However, they were frequently attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux - a sign of their quality and also another reason for their continued popularity.These three works were the Epistola ad fratres de Monte Dei, sometimes called the Epistola aurea, the De natura et dignitate amoris, sometimes called the Liber beati Bernardi de amore, and the De contemplando Dei. Only in the early twentieth century did interest in William as a distinct writer begin to develop again and was his name correctly attached to all of his own writings. William drew upon the existing and traditional monastic and theological authors of his day and significant authors of previous centuries, but not in a slavish way; rather he is creative and independent in his thought and exposition. His own commentaries show his remarkable insight while they also incorporate traditional authors such as Augustine of Hippo and Origen of Alexandria. Perhaps his most influential works are those dealing with the spiritual life of the contemplative monk. From his On Contemplating God to his Golden Epistle, one can see a progressive evolution of William's thought and a maturing of William's spiritual insight and experience, while also noticing an improved, more polished writing style and organization. Some scholars also argue that although William drew on texts and authors in the past, his creativity and usage of spiritual terminology was also influential on many other authors from the 12th century onward. The Latin texts of most of William's writings are contained in J.-P. Migne's Patrologia Cursus Completus Series Latina (Patrologia Latina) volume 180, with other works also in volumes 184 and 185. All of his works are available in critical editions in the Corpus Christianorum Continuatio Medievalis series from Brepols in six volumes (86-89B). The bulk of William‚Äôs writings are available in English translation from Cistercian Publications (formerly located in Kalamazoo and now located at Collegeville, Minnesota, at St. John's University).

Overcoming numerous financial setbacks throughout his lifetime, he remained a successful industrialist. He owned as many as a hundred slaves before the emancipation, but he is remembered by society as a humanitarian to these people and generous provider. Biography On February 20, 1819, he was born in Darlington County, South Carolina, to Robert Potter and Pherobee (Kelly) Wingate. At an early age, his family moved to the delta region of the Mississippi River where logging and sawmills were prevalent. His education was unsophisticated, and he began to work in the lumber industry as a basic hand. At the age of 20, he married Caroline Morgan, a native of Mississippi with whom he had seven children. In 1849, at the age of 30, he owned his first sawmill in Mississippi.TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association After three years of business there (including the rebuilding of the mill from a fire), Wingate moved to Newton County, Texas, in 1852, where he established a large cotton plantation. Within seven years, he became the largest antebellum cotton planter in Southeast Texas, with seventy to eighty slaves working the site.TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association Venture back into the lumber business Wingate saw the lacking timber market of the area as an opportunity, and this led to his discovery of the abandoned Spartan Mill at Sabine Pass. By 1859, he owned this sawmill, which he improved to be the largest steam sawmill facility in the state. He moved his family and thirteen of his slaves to this coastal town. In addition, he established a small fleet of lumber schooners for trade across the Gulf of Mexico. In summer 1860, the Wingate Mill Industries steam boiler exploded, killing several of his employees and disfiguring others. Wingate quickly rebuilt the equipment to continue to operate his mill and to resume providing employment for his people. Participation in the American Civil War In April 1861, Wingate and one of his sons enlisted in the Sabine Pass Guard. David was appointed as chairman of safety for Sabine Pass, as well as Confederate States marshal of the east Texas region. During this time, he began blockade running, but lost a steamer he owned in 1862 when it ran aground. He and his crew torched the craft and the cargo of 500 bales of cotton to avoid capture.David R. Wingate: An East Texas Captain of Commerce At this time, Wingate is credited with supplying the logs needed to build Fort Sabine. In August 1862, the yellow fever epidemic reached Sabine Pass, triggering Wingate to evacuate his family back to Newton County where they remained until the end of the war. Several months later on October 21, a Union Navy patrol invaded Sabine Pass, destroying his sawmill and residence there with fire. In 1864, Wingate was elected chief justice of Newton County, with the provisional civilian governor Andrew J. Hamilton giving him the same appointment the following year.David R. Wingate: An East Texas Captain of Commerce Financial losses and Wingate's move to Orange In 1873, Wingate suffered another substantial financial loss. His transporting craft along with the cargo of cotton being shipped to market, worth about $50,000 dollars in that day, sank in the Sabine River. That same year, Wingate and his wife moved to Orange as he was seeking opportunities once again in the lumber trade. In 1878, his new sawmill called the D. R. Wingate and Company began to operate, but just two years later, it was consumed by fire at a cost equal to that of his last loss. The city of Orange benefited from the presence of David R. Wingate, despite his unfortunate luck with fires. During the 1880s, he built larger facilities, with the demand for lumber always strong. Wingate also served as judge of Orange County from 1878 until 1884. After his wife's death in 1890, he ventured into rice farming which succeeded well and added a new commerce to the region. On February 15, 1899, Wingate died due to pneumonia and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Orange. Wingate remembered by society Nearing the end of the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation led to his slaves being set free in the 1860s. Those same people who were previously owned by D. R. Wingate were well taken care of by him, as part of his obituary reveals: In 1979, the Texas Historical Commission constructed a marker in recognition of David Robert Wingate's achievements, Civil War activities, and his contributions to society.TXGenWeb: Orange County Historical Markers - David Robert Wingate References Category:1819 births Category:1899 deaths Category:People from Darlington County, South Carolina Category:Businesspeople in timber Category:People from Jefferson County, Texas Category:People of Texas in the American Civil War Category:Confederate States Army officers Category:People from Newton County, Texas Category:People from Orange, Texas ","title":"David Robert Wingate"},{"id":"7060093","text":"Goran Milo≈°eviƒá (Serbian Cyrillic: –ì–æ—Ä–∞–Ω –ú–∏–ª–æ—à–µ–≤–∏—õ; born 9 July 1972) is a Serbian former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

The Association owns/ operates the Veen Observatory, located S.W. of Lowell, Michigan, situated on private land per a ninety-nine year lease granted by James M. and H. Evelyn Marron. Construction was started in 1965 and the Observatory was dedicated in 1970, originally with a 12-inch Newtonian reflector constructed by the members. The Chaffee Planetarium made considerable contribution to the building, as well as Kent County businesses and a foundation. It is the largest amateur facility in the state of Michigan, with a 16-inch (Borr), 14-inch (Marron), and 17-inch (Hawkins) telescopes, as well as smaller portable instruments including a hydrogen-alpha solar telescope.

In addition to traditional stand-up comedy, Edmondson's act featured his ability to write in script that was upside down and/or backwards, spell and pronounce words backwards, and read an inverted blackboard correctly.  Quotes from the Professor Backwards act  \\"I came down from Jacksonville on a train that was the slowest train I'd ever been on. I said to the conductor, 'Can't you run any faster?' He said, 'Yeah, but I gotta stay on the train.' A woman ran up to the conductor and said, 'Stop the train. I have to get to the maternity hospital.'

Koehl then drove a woman in Edmondson's Cadillac Eldorado convertible to a house in East Point. Koehl stated that the woman was acting oddly. He stated he had never seen her before. After returning the car, he went home. The next day, Edmondson was accosted at his College Park residence by three men, one of them armed with a pistol. After a demand for $5000, Edmondson produced a check for $300; afterwards, the gunman decided to wait overnight with Edmondson until the local bank opened, at which time, the intruders escorted Edmondson into his automobile and \\"drove around for an hour\\". When the car was stopped, three of the four men (including Edmondson) exited, and Edmondson was shot three times in the head, killing him. All three assailants were eventually arrested, charged with murder and armed robbery, convicted on both charges, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Edmondson's death was satirized by Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live's \\"Weekend Update\\" segment, two days after the shooting with a joke written by Michael O'Donoghue: \\"Well, the popular TV personality known as Professor Backwards was slain in Atlanta yesterday, by three masked gunmen.

The bridge was designed by John Whitton, the Engineer‚Äìin‚ÄìChief of New South Wales Government Railways, and built from 1862 to 1867 by William Piper, Peto Brassey and Betts (superstructure), William Watkins (piers). It is also known as Victoria Bridge, The Nepean Bridge and RTA Bridge No. 333. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2016. The bridge initially carried rail and horse‚Äìdrawn traffic, and was converted in 1907 to exclusively carry the Great Western Highway. The bridge is managed by Roads and Maritime Services. The bridge is the oldest surviving crossing of the Hawkesbury‚ÄìNepean River. As at 2009, Roads and Maritime Services estimated that Victoria Bridge carried an average daily traffic of 25,000 vehicles per day. History Until 1856 travelers who wished to cross the Nepean River were required to use either the Emu Ford or a punt that was located south of the present day Victoria Bridge on Punt Road. This arrangement meant that in times of flood, travellers were often delayed at Penrith for days or even weeks waiting to cross the river. A small village developed near Emu Ford to cater to the people waiting to cross the river. With the discovery of gold west of the Great Dividing Range the flow of people, produce and animals through Penrith and across the river increased dramatically. It was no coincidence that attempts were made to build a permanent structure across the river, resulting in two timber road bridges located near to the eventual Victoria Bridge site being constructed. Prior to the construction of the Victoria Bridge, a punt service was located at the site of the bridge. Following the discovery of gold in the west of the Great Dividing Range demand for a permanent river crossing increased. A timber bridge was constructed with private funds, charging a toll for its use. In 1850 the Government, reacting to lobbying by Penrith locals, passed an Act authorising the construction of a bridge at the western end of Jamison Road. This scheme never went ahead. A second Act was passed in 1851 authorising the formation of a company, allocating A¬£6,000 for the construction of the bridge and allowing for the collection of tolls on the bridge. Following this act the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was formed. A further Act in 1854 increased the allocated funds to A¬£20,000. The first directors of the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company were local entrepreneurs Robert Fitzgerald, James Thomas Ryan, Edwin Rouse, John Perry, Charles York, Henry Hall, Alexander Fraser. Construction of the bridge was under the supervision of David McBeth, a Scottish surveyor. The bridge, completed in December 1855, was long and wide, becoming the first bridge across the Nepean River in the area. McBeth received a A¬£200 bonus on top of his A¬£300 salary for the timely completion of the works, the toll rights for the first year were sold by the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company for A¬£2,250 and traffic flowed across the bridge. The successful Penrith Nepean Bridge Company held a celebration party costing approximately A¬£1,000 on the new bridge to celebrate its completion. Opened in January 1856, the bridge was destroyed by floods in 1857, and again rebuilt. Surviving the February 1860 flood, it was again destroyed in May 1860. Unfortunately this success did not last long. In August 1857 a flood carried away the four centre spans, no doubt due to the poor security of the mid-stream timber piles which reportedly were frayed like mop heads where McBeth had attempted to drive them into rock. McBeth had lacked experience and knowledge in bridge building and although the piles close to the bank went in easily, the mid-stream timber piles had struck rock and failed to achieve a secure penetration. The Penrith Nepean Bridge Company decided to rebuild the bridge and employed an engineer named Moriarty to supervise the works. The construction contract was awarded to William Lockhart for A¬£9,000. The piles that remained from the first bridge were utilised in the new bridge design, against the advice of both Lockhart and Moriarty. The new bridge was of a different, stronger design than the first and construction was completed in good time with the toll rights for one year selling for A¬£2,850. The bridge withstood its first flood, but in 1860 the most devastating flood in New South Wales history until that time washed away the entire superstructure and deposited it on a bank down river. The structure was almost intact. Had the piles been replaced as originally suggested by the engineer and builder, the bridge might well have survived the flood. The Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was ruined by the destruction of the bridge and the directors lost large sums of money. Following the destruction of this second bridge the Government supplied two punts to convey people and goods across the river. The punts were irreparably damaged by a flood in 1867. The loss of the punts coincided with a period in which the Great Western Railway was in the advanced planning stages, including plans for the construction of a bridge over the Nepean River to link Penrith with Bathurst in the west, as part of the Penrith to Weatherboard Line (later Wentworth Falls). It was decided that the required bridge would carry both a railway line and a single lane of road over the river, as a temporary solution.  Construction  Victoria Bridge was designed by the Engineer-in-Chief of Railways in NSW, John Whitton and checked in Britain by his brother-in-law and renowned railway engineer, Sir John Fowler. Victoria Bridge was designed to carry two railway tracks as it was intended that the road on the bridge be only a temporary arrangement. The flood of 1860 that had carried off the previous bridge influenced Whitton to raise the bridge deck by after witnessing the power of high flood waters. The design of the bridge uses half through girders which are actually tall boxes made of riveted wrought iron plates was driven by the need to keep the underside of the bridge as shallow as possible to maximise headroom for flood clearance. The configuration of their boxes with their tall web plates, and upper box for lateral stability, reflected cutting edge design for the period. It utilised cutting edge of structural technology, using principles developed by Robert Stephenson in his design of the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Railway Bridge in Wales; Thomas Telford and others who, by testing and theoretical work, developed techniques to prevent plate buckling by providing frequent vertical stiffeners, and sideways buckling of girders members by adding torsionally stiff boxes at the top and bottom. The first deep box girder bridge was designed by Stephenson and built across the Menai Strait in 1850. It was provided with suspension towers in case the deck was insufficiently strong and stiff, but the cables were never installed. The construction contract for Victoria Bridge was split into several parts. One contract for the construction of the piers was awarded to William Tyler in 1862. He commenced work but flooding in 1863 and 1864 damaged his equipment and contributed to his abandonment of the contract in August 1864. The contract was subsequently awarded to W. Watkins for the sum of A¬£44,658. He completed the work before the agreed completion date and avoided the A¬£50 per week penalty he would have incurred had he not delivered on time. The ironwork for the bridge was supplied by Peto, Brassey and Betts of Birkenhead, England for A¬£41,750. The same firm had supplied the ironwork for the Menangle Railway Bridge constructed on the Nepean River in 1863 and now the oldest surviving bridge on the NSW railway system. The timber approach viaduct for the Victoria Bridge was constructed by Mr Baillie at a cost of A¬£8,716. Other small contracts for earthworks were also made bringing the total cost of the iron bridge to approximately A¬£110,000. High floodwaters struck again soon after the bridge was opened in 1867, when the highest flood recorded until that time damaged the western timber approaches and washed away a portion of the spans and river bank. The main span however withstood this first major test and the flood waters did not reach the underside of the deck. A result of this flood a portion of the damaged timber viaduct was replaced by a shorter wrought iron box-girder span manufactured by the Thames Iron Company, Blackwall, London. The bridge was in operation as a rail bridge during the repair works and was re-opened to road traffic in 1869. The Victoria Bridge was considered to be of such modern design that it was featured in the \\"Modern Examples of Road and Railway Bridges\\" by Maw and Dredge in 1872. Victoria Bridge had a significant impact on the local economy. Prior to its opening Penrith station formed the rail head of the western line, making Penrith a trade hub. The introduction of the road across the Nepean River diminished the business in the town previously brought in by travellers delayed in Penrith by poor river conditions. Conversely the opening of the bridge and the road and railway to the west enabled the growth of centres west of the mountains and the tourist industry of the Blue Mountains to become established. Following the increase in rail traffic on the Great Western Railway and the increase in the weight of locomotive engines, options were considered for the duplication of the railway line and of the Victoria Bridge. The possibility of using Victoria Bridge to carry two rail lines was considered. But this would have required the strengthening of the bridge by constructing intermediate piers between the existing piers of the bridge, thus halving the length of the spans. This technique had been applied to Victoria Bridge's sister structure the Menangle Bridge in 1907. It was however decided that the construction of a second bridge alongside the Victoria Bridge would be more appropriate and construction on a steel truss bridge was undertaken. The piers of the new bridge lined up with Victoria Bridge's existing piers in an attempt to minimise stresses on the structures during high river flows. In 1907 the railway bridge that now stands alongside Victoria Bridge was completed. With its completion the Victoria Bridge was converted to carry two lanes of traffic and a footway while the new bridge carried two rail lines. Originally it took one railway line and a road across the river, however in 1907 another bridge was constructed a few metres to the north which thenceforth took two railway lines across the river, and the original bridge reverted to road and pedestrian use only. In the mid 1930s the timber approach spans of the bridge were discovered to be heavily deteriorated through termite attack and the approach spans were replaced with reinforced concrete trestles and a concrete deck supported by rolled steel joists (RSJs). The site of Victoria Bridge has long been a centre of recreation in the Penrith region. From the 1850s it has been used for national and international rowing competitions. The bridge is significant in the development of the colony of NSW as it allowed the railway, which previously terminated at Penrith, to reach the Railway Blue Mountains and beyond, as well as providing continuous road passage across the river using the Great Western Highway. Current use Today the bridge's significance as a road route to and from the Blue Mountains is diminished. The M4 Western Motorway has replaced the Great Western Highway as the main arterial route, crossing the Nepean River at Regentville. The M4 and the Great Western Highway join/separate at Lapstone Hill. The bridge maintains its significance as a local tourist attraction and a centrepiece to sporting events along the Nepean River, as well as continuing to serve as vital link between the suburbs west of the Nepean, such as Emu Plains, and the major suburban centre of Penrith. The 1907 railway bridge still takes the Main Western and Blue Mountains railway lines over the river. An undivided pedestrian pathway approximately is located adjacent to the roadway. Following community advocacy, in 2010, Roads & Maritime Services commenced a feasibility study into a shared pedestrian/cyclist pathway over the bridge. By mid-2016 Roads & Maritime Services contracted Seymour Whyte to build a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Nepean River, south of the Victoria Bridge, to connect Penrith and Emu Plains. The Bridge was opened to public on 29th October 2018, with an estimated construction cost of $49 million, under the name \\"Yandhai Nepean Crossing\\". It is a straight triangular steel truss bridge and has an overall length of 284m, with a deck length of 257m and weighs over 650 tonnes.  Description  Overview Victoria Bridge is a continuous iron through- bridge (the deck is between the girders rather than on top of them). The three main girders, each spanning a clear , were designed and constructed as one continuous structure (no separations over the piers), a novel structural feature for 1867. This structure, supported by hollow stone piers at centres, has iron cross girders which support a concrete deck, below the tops of the main girders which are deep. Each span has a camber of . There is a secondary, shorter, shallower, simply-supported girder, long at the western (Emu Plains) end of the bridge. All four iron girders have pairs of hollow boxes top and bottom separated by two web plates, an early version of box-girder construction. They are all of riveted construction. The total weight of wrought iron is approximately . The bridge consists of three main spans of iron box girder, one secondary span of iron box girder and three concrete approach spans on either side of the bridge. The piers that support the main spans are constructed of Sydney sandstone, the pier supporting the western end of the secondary iron girder span is constructed of mass concrete. The piers supporting the approach spans are constructed of concrete trestle frames. Piped services are supported under the pedestrian walkway portion of the deck and a large pipe is supported on the top flange of one of the main girders. T-section shaped stiffeners can be seen running vertically down the sides of the girders at the bearing ends. There are five stiffeners over the central piers and three over outer piers. Stiffeners prevent the thin web plates from buckling vertically. Architectural curved angle sections appear on the outer face of the girders of the main span. These serve no structural function but \\"lighten the appearance of the structure\\" There are flood markers on the side of the easternmost sandstone pier. The remnants of old light posts can be seen on the piers on the northern side of the bridge. There are modern street light posts and lights on the southern piers of the bridge.  Condition  As at 1 December 2008, the fabric of the bridge is generally in very good condition. There is little sign of rust on iron elements and concrete and stone elements also appear to be in good condition. The remains of the piles of the earlier bridges may still be embedded in the riverbed. There is also the possibility that relics of the construction platforms, crane bases or coffer damns used to construct Victoria Bridge may be found in the riverbed. The bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.  Modifications and dates  The bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact. *1869 - Western approach spans were rebuilt following damage of the original timber approach spans by flood two weeks after the bridge was opened. The new spans were of a similar design to the main spans but with cast iron caisson piers. *-90 - The original road surface was close- fitting timber planking, wheel guides were installed early in the life of the bridge to help horse and bullock drawn vehicles drive in a straight line on the timber boards. *1883 - a galvanised iron fence was installed between the single railway track and the single lane road portion of the bridge. Around this time a warning bell was also installed to warn of approaching trains. This was installed after several incidents on the bridge involving livestock on the bridge being disturbed by passing trains. *1907 - new double track railway bridge was opened and the single railway line was removed from Victoria Bridge. The deck was also reconstructed to accommodate two lanes of traffic. *1934 - Approach spans and abutments reconstructed in steel and concrete *19?? - The footway across the main spans reconstructed to provide for utility pipes.  Heritage listing  As at 18 March 2015, Victoria Bridge is of state heritage significance as one of only three bridges of its type that were ever constructed in NSW, of which only two remain ('wrought iron- through girder'). Although two bridges of this type still remain, Victoria Bridge is unique in NSW due to the intactness of its form compared to Menangle bridge, which has undergone significant alterations to its structural form through the addition of intermediate piers. Victoria bridge represents a type of bridge that was considered to be the cutting edge of technology when it was designed in 1862. Design principles used in Victoria Bridge were pioneered by Robert Stephenson in his design of the Britannia Bridge and The Conwy Bridge in Britain. In addition to this prestigious design history, Victoria Bridge has the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW. The bridge is of state significance due to its role in bridging the Nepean River for the Great Western Railway. Victoria Bridge was a key element in bringing the railways to western NSW. The bridge's association with the designer of the Great Western Railway, John Whitton is also of significance. Victoria Bridge (Penrith) was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Victoria Bridge is of state significance for its historical role as a vital element in the development of key road and rail transport routes across NSW from the 1860s and 1870s. In particular this includes the Great Western Railway line which opened up the western regions of the NSW, and made a significant contribution to improving trade flow across the state. As a road bridge it places a significant role in the story of crossing of the flood prone Nepean River, and was the first successful bridge crossing at Penrith. In addition to the wider advantages the bridge brought for transport across the state, it also has local significance for its economically on local workers and economies. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Victoria Bridge is of state significance for its association with its designer John Whitton, Engineer-in Chief for the NSW Railways, who also designed the Great Western Railway and the Zig Zag Railway at Lapstone and Lithgow. Mr Whitton was an outstanding engineer of his time and was also responsible for overseeing construction of the bridge and the railway line between Penrith and Wentworth Falls. It is also associated with the renowned British engineer John Fowler, of Firth of Forth Bridge Fame, who checked Whitton's design and plans and supervised the fabrication of the bridge in England. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Victoria Bridge is of state aesthetic significance because its design was based on important principles pioneered by Robert Stephenson on the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Bridge in Wales. It is the most intact of only two iron through girder bridges built in NSW. Menangle Bridge now has intermediate piers and so no longer has its original form. Victoria Bridge is the only one of its type still operating with the same structural system that it was built with. The bridge has been an important landmark in Penrith since its construction. The bridge has state technical and aesthetic significance. Whitton's design employed the latest in British Bridge technology, utilising the through girder form, reinforced with boxes at the top and bottom of the girders, and long continuous spans to achieve maximum waterway, a feature of major importance at this site. The construction of the bridge constituted a major project carried out under extremely difficult circumstances. The bridge has strong and bold lines, providing a reassure presence in a landscape continually attacked by high floods which destroyed two previous bridges. It is a highly visually distinctive structure, and its enclosing form has always provided a distinctive travel experience, whether crossing by train, horse- drawn vehicle, motor vehicle or on foot. The Victoria Bridge and the visually complementary adjacent rail bridge form a landmark from both the Great Western highway and from the Nepean River and its banks. Both bridges are visually articulate about their structural properties and together, through their contrasting forms, provide an essay on the developments in metal bridge design across the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The quality and longevity of the bridge is evidence of Whitton's correct understanding of the power of the Nepean and his enormous commitment to build railways of a high standard, employing cutting edge British technology in a colony barely out of its infancy. The high level of the bridge and its robust stone piers, as well as s the iron span on the western end of the bridge added after its initial completion are articulate about the devastating potential of the river and the high level of persistence intelligence and investment required to bridge it. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Public esteem for the bridge and an enduring interest in its management and use over its lifetime has imbued Victoria Bridge with social significance at a State level. Its historic, technical and aesthetic qualities are widely recognised within the Penrith, Sydney and Blue Mountains communities and more widely among railway and bridge enthusiasts and historians. It forms a landmark in the Penrith area and has been the centrepiece of the tourist and sporting activities of the Nepean which have attracted boating parties, swimmers, rowers, spectators and picnickers from a wide catchment area. The bridge has local significance as a place of recreation. It is significant to the Heritage Engineers of Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Victoria Bridge has research significance at a State level as one of the oldest metal bridges in Australia. Together with the Menangle Railway Bridge and Prince Alfred Bridge at Gundagai, it is an important benchmark in early metal bridge design and construction practices giving insight into these activities which would be difficult to gain from other sources. With the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW and being the most intact of two remaining bridges in the state of this type, the Victoria Bridge is of state significance for its research potential to illustrate the design and construction techniques of this type of bridge. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Victoria Bridge is of state significance as the only \\"iron-through girder\\" bridge that has not been significantly altered, making it unique in NSW. It was one of three iron box-girder bridges built in NSW and one of only two surviving bridges, the other being at Menangle. The third, being an 1869 single span over the Wollondilly River near Goulburn, was demolished after duplication of the Great Southern Railway in 1914. The bridge also has State significance more generally as one of the oldest metal bridges in NSW and Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is of state significance because it is representative of the cutting edge of bridge design in 1864 and is representative of early wrought iron heavy bridge design. It also represents the importance of high quality bridge design in the opening up of Western NSW to the railway.

Bachelor‚Äôs/master‚Äôs degree [rogram The university established a combined bachelor's/master's degree program so that students can receive both the bachelor's and the master's degree in just five years: seven semesters for Bachelor's and three for Master's. Controversy Shim Hwa-jin, the granddaughter of founder Li Suk-jong, served as the university's president from 2007 for two terms. When she was once more elected as president for a third term, which would extend her incumbency to 2019, four members of the university's student association raised concerns that Shim had embezzled funds from the school, which led to their suspension in January 2016. The students successfully pursued a court case to have the suspension overturned, and it was struck down in October. Meanwhile, investigative journalists found that a prominent individual's daughter had been admitted to Sungshin after cheating in the assessment, while one of Shim's relatives had also been appointed as a tenure-track lecturer using a plagiarised dissertation. Charges of embezzlement were brought against Shim and, on 7 February 2017, the Seoul Northern District Court returned a guilty verdict, concluding that Shim had embezzled 378 million won from school funds. She was demoted from her position as president and served nine days in prison before posting bail of 50 million won on 20 February. She was succeeded as president of Sungshin Women's University by Kim Ho-sung.

Biography Terry was born in Limerick, 1660, to John Terry, from Cork, and wife Mary Ronan. After the defeat of James II of England, the court went into exile in St Germain, France. James Terry had been serving as Athlone Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary at the Irish Office of Arms, and took his seal of office and his heraldic records with him to France. As James II still considered himself King of England, Scotland, and Ireland, he needed a herald with him to handle matters of heraldry and ceremonial. In 1690, he appointed Terry to the post of Athlone Herald. It is interesting to consider that during the exile, Terry was in communication with English and Scottish heralds when it became necessary to verify armorial records and genealogies. In spite of the dispute between the royals that employed them, the heralds still maintained a collegial working relationship. Terry continued granting arms to the members of the Irish diaspora until his death in 1725. After his death, the Irish abroad were obliged to apply to Ulster King of Arms for grants. A collection of his pedigrees and papers has been published in bookform. Family In 1678, Terry married Mary Stritch of Limerich, and had several children: *John, naturalised Spanish as Juan Bautista Tirry y Stritch.

Founded by Ami Wilson (vocals, guitar, electric violin, synth, drums, effects, programming, production) and Justin Gagen (guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, drums, effects, engineering, production), Redzone were early adopters, among UK bands, in the use of the Internet to distribute music and video. After recording demos in 1997, they released two MP3 web singles in 1998, \\"Torrid\\" / \\"Crime of Passion\\" and \\"Layer6\\" / \\"Body Craves\\". Their debut CD Modified came out in 1999 on their own Phasechange Recordings label, and was followed by [Digital Flesh] in 2005, containing an interactive, multi-threaded CD-ROM video. Redzone were credited by Wired UK and Reuters, as being the first band to tour in Second Life in February 2007. They co-promoted and performed at the Scorched Earth Festival, which took place on 1 May 2007. The third Redzone studio album, Abstract Revolution was released on 20 June 2008, and a track was played on BBC Radio 4, on 15 March 2009. The White Sun DVD was released on 12 December 2008. A single, \\"Film Noir\\" was released on 27 May 2010, and the White Sun DVD soundtrack album on 20 November 2010. The first in a series of three download-only EPs, Ultrastructure volume I was released on 1 May 2011 at the Mayday Mayhem Festival in Second Life. The event was curated by Redzone. The second in the series, Ultrastructure volume II was released on 31 October 2011, and volume III on 30 September 2013. Redzone have, since 2011, been largely concerned with improvisation in live shows and have released a series of albums based upon this practice. These include Gathering of The Tribes and Venus Smiles, and a series of performances recorded at their 'Atropine' venue in Second Life, collectively known as 'The Atropine Tapes'. The first of these, Eject and Survive was released in October 2011, the second, The Breeding Station in November 2012, and the third, Einfangen on 4 May 2013. Redzone appeared on BBC Television on 21 June 2013, and were extensively featured in a chapter entitled 'Performing Live in Second Life' in The Oxford Handbook of Music and Virtuality, published in 2016. The founders of Redzone created The Internet Audio Cyclotron (IAC) in 2015, and used this tool to produce two albums: Noise Ocean in 2015 and Cracked in 2016. Gagen and Wilson also produced Aurosion: Eroding Sonic Landscapes with the Internet Audio Cyclotron, using the IAC in 2016. Wilson released her debut solo album I Hear You (as Kassia Flux) in 2018, and the follow up Ergot in The Wine in 2019.. She was named a BBC Radio 3 Late Junction \`One to Watch' for 2019.

Its aim is to encourage language learning across Europe.  Objectives  The general objectives of the European Day of Languages are to: ‚Ä¢ Alert the public to the importance of language learning, diversity and the range of languages learned in order to increase plurilingualism and intercultural understanding ‚Ä¢ Promote the rich linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe ‚Ä¢ Encourage lifelong language learning in and out of school In keeping with these rules, people, young and old, are encouraged to take up a language, or take special pride in their existing language skills. Also, those responsible for providing access to language learning are encouraged to make it easier for people to learn a range of languages, and to support policy initiatives to promote languages. There is also an emphasis on learning a language other than English. On the occasion of the day, a range of events are organised across Europe, including those for children, television and radio programmes, language classes and conferences. The events are not organised by the Council of Europe or the European Union nor do they allocate special funding (i.e. apart from their existing language programmes) for the day. Member states and potential partners are given a free hand to organise activities. To coordinate the activities organised at the national level, the Council of Europe asks participating countries to nominate \\"National Relay Persons\\" for the day. The national relay in the UK used to be CILT, the National Centre for Languages. Languages of Europe There are about 225 indigenous languages in Europe - roughly 3% of the world's total.https://slideplayer.com/slide/8139189/ Most of the European languages are of Indo-European origin. Since the end of the 18th century, the most widespread language of Europe (both in terms of geography and the number of native speakers) has been Russian, which replaced French. Counting only native speakers, approximately 150 million Europeans speak Russian on a daily basis, followed by German (approx. 95 mil.), Turkish (approx. 80 mil.), English and French (each by 65 mil.), Italian ( by 60 mil.), Spanish and Polish (40 mil. each), Ukrainian (30 mil.) and Romanian (26 mil.). As far as foreign language studies are concerned, English is currently the most popular foreign language in Europe, followed by German, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish. Multilingualism today According to the European Union survey \\"Europeans and their Languages\\" (\\"Special Eurobarometer 243\\", February 2006), 56% of EU citizens (25 member states) speak a language other than their mother tongue, but 44% admit to not knowing any languages other than their native language. However, 28% have knowledge of two foreign languages. Among EU citizens, 38% indicate that they know English, followed by 14% knowing French or German, 7% Russian, 5% Spanish and 3% Italian. The typical multilingual European is a student or someone holding a managerial position or someone born in a country where the language of his/her parents is different from the main language of the country. With greater numbers of immigrants and refugees, European cities have become more multilingual. For example: in Moscow and Saint Petersburg many recent immigrants speak Ukrainian, Romanian, Armenian, Tatar, Azeri, Tajik, Chinese or one of many other languages; in London some 300 languages are spoken (English, French, Chinese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Bengali, Persian, Turkish, Kurdish, Berber, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi etc.). The European Union adheres to a policy of multilingualism, both in its institutional workings and as an aim for its citizens. At the 2002 EU summit in Barcelona, it set a target for children to learn at least two foreign languages from an early age. Multilingualism for the EU is linked to worker mobility and the European economy. The European Union spends more than ‚Ç¨30 million a year promoting language learning and linguistic diversity through the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, a policy that began with the pioneering Lingua programme in 1990.

Biography Early years Lee Baker grew up in Watford, England where he attended Watford Boys' Grammar School. Having gained A-Levels in Art, Maths & Physics he went on to read Modern Art at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where he graduated in 1992. During his time at university, Baker formed and fronted his first band, called Cup of Sunshine. Marbaker Baker left Newcastle to settle in Brighton and it was here that he truly focused on forging a career in the music industry, forming a new 4 piece band, Marbaker. The new band soon proved hugely popular on the live music circuit. It was not long before Marbaker was signed to Chrysalis Music and toured the UK to promote the band's debut single \\"Hope You Find\\". This first release received national radio airplay and the accolade of Melody Maker's Single of the Week as voted by the band Gomez. However, frustrated with the direction in which the band was going, Marbaker split up and the first album was never made. Performer, writer & producer After the breakup of Marbaker, Baker continued to perform, write and produce new material both for himself, other artists, including Mo Solid Gold and Chung King, and for TV programmes and advertising. In a move away from the more soulful and hypnotic beats of Marbaker, Baker co- wrote, performed and produced a clutch of club tunes under the guise of \\"Special Unit\\". The most successful of these was \\"Sights on You\\" which was hugely popular on the UK and Miami club scene, reaching number 1 in Pete Tong's BBC Radio 1 Buzz Chart in the UK. Baker continues to work for and with others; he produced an acoustic remix of the hit single \\"Borderline\\" by Michael Gray and wrote the score for an episode of BBC Four's Arena series, celebrating 57 years of the BBC Radio 4 radio drama serial The Archers -- a testament to Baker's breadth of musical capabilities. Tim Booth & James Baker teamed up with Tim Booth at the time the ex-front man of the band James. The two formed a strong friendship based on a chance meeting in Brighton which ultimately led to the release of the highly acclaimed album Bone, which was produced by Baker and written by Booth, Baker and KK (Kevin Kerrigan). The album artwork was also created by Baker. The band was called \\"Tim Booth and the Individuals\\", and toured the UK and the US and received much radio airplay, including the UK's Virgin Radio and BBC Radio 2 with Jonathan Ross. The band also appeared on TV on BBC Three and played to a packed crowd at the Glastonbury Festival. The album, although highly acclaimed, never achieved commercial success, and the band have moved on to pursue their individual interests. Tim Booth had a small part in the film Batman Begins and is writing a screenplay, but most notably is now back with James who announced their reformation in January 2007. Lisa Lindley Jones is embarking upon a solo career, and her first single \\"Firetime\\" was released in October 2006. With James' reformation, Baker produced two new songs, followed by James's new album Hey Ma, which was released on 7 April 2008. He sings backing vocals for James on Hey Ma and also does so on \\"Not So Strong\\", an additional track released via the James website in 2009. In 2011, Baker and Tim Booth released their second collaboration album titled \\"Love Life\\". It was released under Booth's name, but Lee Baker produced, mixed, and performed on the recording, while co-writing many tracks on the album as well. My Federation Since the end of Tim Booth and the Individuals, Baker formed a new band, called My Federation. The band has released a debut album called Don't Wanna Die and an EP Honey Bee.My Federation's website This Morning After the loss of Fern Britton from ITV This Morning in 2009, it was announced Holly Willoughby would take over her position along with a full graphic, logo and music rebrand. Baker was approached to rearrange the familiar signature tune, which needed updating after sixteen years on air. His rendition remained until 2013 when a new version premiered to celebrate the 25th Anniversary year, though this rendition was short lived and Baker's arrangement was reinstated for another year between 2014 and 2015.

Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets, checkboxes, radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars, etc., to text user interfaces. This package also contains the shared library needed by programs built with newt, as well as an application whiptail, which provides the most commonly used features of dialog. Newt is based on the slang library. It abbreviates from Not Erik's Windowing Toolkit.  Features  Newt was originally designed for use in the install code of Red Hat Linux and is written mostly focusing on clear interface, simplicity and small footprint. Because of that, unlike most recent GUI engines, it does not use an event- driven architecture. Windows must be created and destroyed as a stack (the order of discarding is the exact opposite to that of creation). The top level window is always modal. Many behaviours, such as widget traversal order, are difficult or impossible to change. Mouse control appears to be supported in the source code, using GPM (a mouse-driver) but many users report Newt and Whiptail not responding to mouse control. These restrictions simplify the design of the library as well as the code of programs using it, though they impose limitations on user interface design.  Usage  The capabilities are fully adequate for the installation process, and Newt was used for the user friendly OS installers. It is also used in some system tools (like Partimage) that focus more on functionality than on looking attractive to the end user.  Interoperability  Newt is written in C. However, there are bindings to other languages.  Variants  gNewt project (no longer active) provides an alternative implementation that uses GTK instead of the text based interface. It is fully compatible with the official Newt implementation and can be replaced at run time, without recompilation. Like any other GTK components, gNewt controls can also use mouse input whereas the original Newt only supports the keyboard.

It later housed the Birmingham science museum Museum of Science and Industry until the creation of Thinktank. Standing opposite the Birmingham Assay Office, the original 19th century silver electroplating factory of George Elkington, built in 1838, once occupied a much longer, grandiose building on Newhall Street which was largely demolished in the mid-1960s. The works had many workshops and warehouses along and over the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and the now filled-in Whitmore's Arm (or Miss Colmore's Arm) canal, which ran through the site. In the early 1850s there was a steam-powered electric generator with 64 permanent magnets arranged in a circle and a rotating wrought iron armature. The electroplating process involved solutions of cyanide of silver and potassium cyanide. The building carries two blue plaques on its wall, one to George Elkington, and another to his employee Alexander Parkes who is credited with inventing the first plastic.  Museum of Science and Industry  The site hosted the science museum of Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery from 1951 until its closure in 1997. Many exhibits were then moved to Thinktank, which later opened as an entrance-fee-based exhibition in Millennium Point in Eastside, in September 2001. Among the famous exhibits to move in the relocation was the 1797 Smethwick Engine, produced by famous local industrialist James Watt. It had originally been located in the town of Smethwick, before being relocated to the Birmingham Canal Navigation Workshops at Ocker HillThis gave the engine its alternative name of the 'Ocker Hill Engine' (actually some 10 miles away to a town named Tipton) in 1897. However, it came to the museum in 1959 on the closure of the workshops. Also moved to the new museum was Elkington's own Woolrich Electrical Generator, made in 1844, the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process.Birmingham Museums trust catalogue, accession number: 1889S00044 Future development Demolition of the buildings not fronting Newhall Street, in October 2006 Birmingham City Council put up the site, which runs along Newhall Street and Charlotte Street, and adjoins the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, for long lease and redevelopment. The development was awarded to St Bernard's Property in 2002. Planning permission was granted in 2006 for the Jewellery Box - a mixed use leisure, commercial and residential development with 234 apartments.

The club was formed 24 February 1895 out of the merger of the school clubs Concordia Leipzig and Saxonia Leipzig. Wacker was a founding member of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund) in 1900. FC changed its name to SC Wacker Leipzig in 1918 and in 1921 was joined by Friesen Leipzig. After the re-organization of German football into sixteen premier divisions under the Third Reich in 1933 Wacker played top-flight football in the Gauliga Sachsen for several seasons before being relegated in 1937. The club returned to Gauliga play for single season appearances in 1940 and 1944. Allied authorities ordered all existing organizations, including sports and football associations, disbanded after World War II. The developing Cold War that would divide the country into East and West Germany led to the formation of separate football leagues in the Soviet-occupied areas which included Leipzig. Wacker was re-constituted as SG Motor Gohlis-Nord Leipzig and took up play in the Bezirk Leipzig in 1946 before advancing to the 2.DDR-Liga (III), Staffel 3 as Motor Nord Leipzig in 1958. The club fielded competitive teams that earned a handful of top three finishes before beginning a slide that finally led to relegation to the Berzirksliga Leipzig (IV) in 1963. After only a single season there the club disappeared into the lower divisions. Wacker first played its home matches at the Gohlitzer Exerzierplatz (1902‚Äì23) before moving to the Wacker-Platz Debrahof (1923‚Äì45).

It is located fourteen kilometres outside the town of New Ross. As of the 2016 census, Campile village had a population of 448 people. History Memorial in Campile marking the bombing of the area during WW2 Archaeological evidence of ancient settlement in the area include several burnt mounds and ringforts in the neighbouring townlands of Ballyvelig, Tinnock, and Dunbrody. Approximately 1 km southwest of Campile is the 12th century Dunbrody Abbey, and the 17th century bawn of the (incomplete) Dunbrody Castle. In 1798, during the United Irishmen Rebellion, a rebel camp was located on nearby Slieve Coillte hill. During World War II, in which Ireland remained officially neutral, the German Luftwaffe bombed Campile. Three women were killed during a daylight bombing on 26 August 1940 - Mary Ellen Kent (30), her sister Catherine Kent (26), both from Terrerath, and Kathleen Hurley (27) from Garryduff. Four German bombs were dropped on the creamery and restaurant sections of Shelburne Co-op, and the railway line was also targeted. The attack has never been fully explained, although some historians have suggested that it was a deliberate attack to discourage the supply of foodstuffs to wartime Britain. On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the bombing, a memorial garden was dedicated to the memory of the three women who died. The local 'Harts Bar and Lounge' contains some artifacts relating to the bombing. Amenities The village has two small supermarkets, a Centra store and a Londis store. There are also two smaller local shops. The Shelbourne Co-Op, founded in 1919, still has a premises in the village albeit under the Glanbia banner. There is also a pharmacy, joinery, hardware store, filling station, take-away, soccer pitch, hair salon, community hall and two pubs.

The parish school is situated in Ballyfarnogue, adjacent to the Horeswood GAA complex, two miles from the village. Transport Rail transport Campile station closed in 2010 Campile railway station opened on 1 August 1906. On 21 July 2010, Irish Rail announced that it would suspend its rail service through Campile, and this took effect after the operation of the evening train on 18 September 2010. Before that date, it was served Mondays to Saturdays by one passenger train in each direction. Bus transport Prior to the cessation of the rail service Campile's Bus √âireann service was infrequent consisting of the commuter route between Duncannon and Waterford city via New Ross and on certain days by a cross-country bus to Wexford. After the rail service ceased, the bus service was enhanced significantly. A revised Bus √âireann route 370 service came into effect from Monday 20 September 2010.

Shot on digital video, the film tells the story of a young gay Chinese-American man's search for true love and family acceptance within a framework of traditional norms. Under One Roof played worldwide at LGBTQ film festivals following its release. Plot Daniel Chang (Wong) is a twenty- something second-generation Chinese-American living at home in San Francisco with his widowed mother, who can speak broken English, and his grandmother (his father's mother), who cannot speak English. Ever since his father died, he has fulfilled his patriarchal duty as first and only son by managing the family business and looking after his mother. Being gay, he avoids the second major responsibility of carrying on the family line through heterosexual marriage and reproduction. Out of respect for his mother's values, he tries to keep, as he puts it, his home life and his \\"homo life\\" separate. By not directly telling his mother that he is gay, he has unwittingly found himself in a tense but hilarious situation where his mother continually pressures him to marry women of her choosing. Luckily, Daniel's female friend, Michelle, graciously rescues him from the constant onslaught of potential dates by pretending to be his steady girlfriend (for a price), which deflects his need to come out to his mother. Besides the extra money Mrs. Chang makes playing Mahjong, she also rents out the basement illegally. Daniel relates how he was quite happy to leave the previous female tenant alone. Daniel expects his mother to replace the previous tenant with another woman and is astounded when the new tenant turns out to be Robert, a young attractive white man from Indiana. Daniel immediately has a crush on him. Following a plumbing mishap that floods the basement with raw sewage, Mrs. Chang apologetically moves Robert into the only other bedroom that is not hers‚ÄîDaniel's room. Even though reality has merged with Daniel's deepest fantasies, he bows to the paranoia that his mother will find out he is gay and decides to sleep on the living room sofa. Mrs. Chang eventually kicks Daniel off the couch so she can watch her late-night TV programs, and he is forced to share his bed with Robert. Daniel manages to be prudish for a few nights but eventually the two become lovers. Daniel's fear of being caught making out with a man constantly gets in between his relationship with Robert, and Daniel begins to wish that the basement repairs would finish soon so they could move their lovemaking to a safer area. However, one day Mrs. Chang and Grandma return home earlier than expected right in the middle of one of Daniel and Robert's trysts. Grandma walks in on them during copulation to offer them mooncakes, one of the few English words she knows. She sheepishly leaves the mooncakes on the nightstand and exits, giving them enough time to roll apart to opposite sides of the bed just as Mrs. Chang walks in. Daniel quickly chastizes her for not knocking and makes up the excuse that he was napping. Mrs. Chang does not seem to notice that both he and Robert are naked, but she bluntly tells Robert to move his belongings back into the basement that night. With the basement repaired, Daniel imagines he can finally spend time with Robert away from his mother's prying eyes, but the very next day a San Francisco building inspector stops by. Daniel suspects his own mother called the inspector, who gives the Chang's a list of expensive home improvements that would be needed to legally rent the room. Mrs. Chang jumps at the chance, arguing with Daniel that she has no choice but to make Robert move out. Their argument echoes in the basement and Robert hears Daniel give in without too much of a fight. Heartbroken, Robert moves away to a friend's place in Pasadena. Daniel reaches his breaking point. Miserable and determined not to be alone forever, he comes out to his mother the very next time she starts talking about available young women. This time he is direct and asserts that he wants to be with Robert. Mrs. Chang reacts angrily, lecturing Daniel in her native tongue and storming away from him. In her confusion, disappointment and fear of losing Daniel (who threatened to move out), she turns to the only other woman she knows with a gay son, Robert's mother. Robert's mother asks Mrs. Chang if it wouldn't be so bad to have another son, a clever way of getting around the cultural taboo of same- sex love. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Chang calls Daniel back home to meet another potential date. Daniel flips out and races back home to stand up to his mother for the last time.

History Once a seafront promenade, Queen Elizabeth Walk was part of the Esplanade, a long open stretch of field by the sea, although it was not until 1953 that it got its name. Before the land reclamation project in 1843, the original shoreline touched the wide Esplanade, approximately at the edges of both the Singapore Cricket Club and Singapore Recreation Club buildings. A plaque at Queen Elizabeth Walk commemorating its opening on 30 May 1953 Further landfill and reclamation in 1890 enabled the widening of the Esplanade when an area almost equivalent to Raffles' Plain (now the Padang) was added to its coastal side. A sea wall was also built and a new road, called New Esplanade Road, was formed. New Esplanade Road sat on the curve of the original shoreline and formed a circuit with Old Esplanade Road, now Saint Andrew's Road, which was popular for evening carriage rides among the leisurely class. In 1907, New Esplanade Road was renamed Connaught Drive, to commemorate the visit of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and his brother, King Edward VII, the year before. In the early years of the twentieth century, ths scenic coastal road stretched all the way from the city to Keppel Harbour. The instructions, \\"jalan tepi laut\\" in Malay, meaning \\"go by the seaside\\", were understood by all and sundry. In 1922, there was further reclamation off the coast along Connaught Drive and the new land became the Esplanade Park. In 1953, Elizabeth II was crowned and Singapore commemorated the event by sprucing up Connaught Drive and renaming the Esplanade Park as Queen Elizabeth Walk. It was officially declared open by Lady McNeice on 30 May 1953. With newly planted shady trees and neatly trimmed shrubs, the promenade quickly became a favourite place for an evening stroll. From there, strollers could catch the sea breeze, admire hundreds of ships in the harbour with their colourful fluttering flags and eat freshly barbecued satay at the Satay Club, which consisted of a collection of seafront hawker stalls. Today Today, the Queen Elizabeth Walk refers to the stretch of promenade by Marina Bay within the Esplanade Park. The Satay Club has moved to Clarke Quay and become a tourist attraction. The sea view at the walk, however, is now obscured by both the Esplanade Theatres on the Bay and the vehicular Esplanade Bridge. Despite this, Queen Elizabeth Walk is still a pleasant stretch, which holds several monuments linked to the historical Anderson Bridge, including the Tan Kim Seng Fountain, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial, the Indian National Army Plaque and the Cenotaph.

Biography Nothing is known of his early life except that he was of English parentage. The conjecture of an early-20th- century biographer (Williams) that he was born at Poole, Dorsetshire is not supported by any evidence. Other accounts state that he came from Devonshire (specifically Exeter, born around 1080). John of Hexham's continuation of the history of Symeon of Durham, written within half a century of Pullen's death, asserts that king Henry I of England offered him a bishopric which he refused, being devoted to the study of philosophy. His early education was received in England, but during the troubles which began with the accession of King Stephen in 1135 he seems to have gone to Paris to continue his life of study in peace there. According to other accounts, he completed his education at Paris (at the Sorbonne). In 1133 he began to teach at Oxford, being among the first of the celebrated teachers in the schools which were afterwards organized into the University of Oxford.Turner, William. \\"Robert Pullus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 22 October 2016 Multitudes are said to have come to hear him.Newman, John Henry. \\"The Schoolmen\\",, Historical Sketches, Longman, Green, 1894 He opened schools there and taught without exacting fees; he is said to have supported many scholars at his own expense and to have been largely instrumental in fostering the growth of the Oxford schools. If these traditions are true, albeit that they rest on the statements of later writers, it would seem more probable that they happened during the reign of Henry I, when he refused to accept the bishopric offered. He was certainly Archdeacon of Rochester in 1134, and was absent from England for a notable time within the next few years, for at some date prior to 1143 he seems to have been in trouble with his bishop for being absent so long from his duties. This appears from an undated letter of St. Bernard addressed to the Bishop of Rochester, in which the saint makes his excuses for detaining Pullen in Paris \\"on account of the sound doctrine which is recognized in him.\\" In the same letter he blames the bishop for seizing the archdeacon's goods, and he begs that Pullen may stay longer in Paris where he is necessary. Though Bishop Stubbs (op. cit.) has thrown doubt on the identity of this Archdeacon Robert Pullen with the cardinal Robert Pullus (also called Pullen), the statements of St. Bernard's biographer, William Abbot of Theodoric, and the Oseney Chronicle justify the identification. While in Paris, Pullen taught logic and theology with great success. Among his pupils was John of Salisbury, who describes him as a man commended both by his life and his learning, in 1141 or 1142.Coffey, Peter. \\"John of Salisbury.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 22 October 2016 In 1143 he is still described as Archdeacon of Rochester and in or about that year he probably went to Rome on the invitation of Innocent II, who died in September of that year, but Pullen found favour with the new pope, Celestine II, who created him a cardinal (Ciaconius). The Oseney chronicler, however, states that he was called to Rome by Lucius II who succeeded Celestine in 1144. Certainly Pope Lucius appointed him Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, an office which he was discharging through 1145 and 1146.\\"Pullus, Robert\\". Christian Cyclopedia, (Erwin L. Lueker, Luther Poellot, Paul Jackson, eds.), Concordia Publishing House, 2000 This we know from the biography of St. Bernard written by William of St. Thierry, and from his letters. Pullus was instrumental in the development of the concept of purgatory, questioning where purgation took place, as neither heaven nor hell seemed entirely appropriate. Le Goff, Jacques. The Birth of Purgatory, University of Chicago Press, 1986, p. 150 Whether by Lucius or Celestine, he was a cardinal by around 1144. When St. Bernard's disciple, Eugenius III, became pope in 1145, the saint wrote a letter to Cardinal Pullen begging him to console and counsel the new pontiff. His date of death is uncertain; he died in or after 1146. Works As a theologian Cardinal Pullen used all his influence against the teaching of Abelard, and embodied his doctrine in his work Sententiarum Logicarum Libri VIII.Reprinted in Patrologia Latina, with the commentary prefixed to it by the Maurist, Dom Hugo Mathoud, originally written for his edition, published at Paris in 1655. In this treatise he was breaking new ground, being one of the first teachers to compile a book of \\"Sentences,\\" but his work was soon supplanted by that of Peter Lombard (with his \\"Libri Sententiarum\\"). He covers a wide range of subjects, but his treatment lacks orderly arrangement, and he relies for his proofs on Scripture and reason in preference to the testimony of tradition. Taking his stand on the authority of the Bible and of papal decisions, he proceeds to enter on speculative discussion. The first book treats of God and His attributes; the second, of the creation, of angels, of the soul, of the fall of man and of original sin; the third, of the ancient and the new law, and of the Incarnation; the fourth, of God's power, of Christ's Passion and of hell and purgatory; the fifth, of the Resurrection, the descent of the Holy Ghost, the preaching of the Gospel, of the sacraments of baptism, confirmation and confession and some virtues and vices. The sixth book deals with a variety of subjects, including ignorance, negligence and frailty, good and bad spirits, the choirs of angels, merits, and the administration of the Sacrament of Penance; the seventh discusses the forgiveness of sins, penance and fasting, prayer, tithes, the civil power, the priesthood, its privileges and obligations, continency, the contemplative and active life, and matrimony. The eighth book deals with the Blessed Sacrament, the Second Advent, Antichrist, the Last Judgment and the ultimate state of the saved and the lost. Marcia L. Colish describes the eight volume work as poorly organized, redundant and \\"unwieldy\\".Colish, Marcia L., Peter Lombard. 1, BRILL, 1994, p.70 The titles of some other works which remain unpublished are given by Pitts: \\"In Apocalypsim Sancti Johannis\\"; \\"Super aliquot psalmos\\"; \\"De contemptu mundi\\"; \\"Super doctorum dictis\\"; \\"Praelectiones\\"; \\"Sermones.\\" A manuscript copy of the sermons is preserved at Lambeth Palace, and Rashdall (Dictionary of Nat.

The highway extends from Gulf Shores on the Gulf of Mexico coast to Uriah in rural southwestern Alabama. Route description The route begins at a junction with SR 21 in Uriah. The route maintains an east-to-west route for about ten miles until it reaches Georgetown. Here it turns north-to-south. The route continues south until it crosses into Baldwin County. It reaches Bay Minette and junctions with SR 225, and eventually I-65 at mile 34. The route then continues south to SR 287, also known as the Gulf Shores Parkway. That route is an effective route for people heading to Montgomery and beyond from Gulf Shores. The routes swap right-of-ways and SR 59 continues along the Gulf Shores Parkway. The route reaches US 31 soon. The two routes engage in a concurrency to Stapleton. US 31 splits off from SR 59 and heads towards Mobile. SR 59 continues downwards to Loxley, where it junctions with I-10 at a Parclo Interchange at exit 44. It then engages with a much shorter concurrency with US 90 (much shorter than its concurrency with US 31). The route continues south to Foley, which is home to its notable junction with the Foley Beach Express access road and its other notable junction with US 98. After passing by The Park at OWA and a Lambert's Cafe, the route makes a short journey south to the Pelican Place at Craft Farms. Just past that point, the route makes a slight curve and The Track Family Fun Center comes into play, a small entertainment complex. Immediately after that junction, the road crosses Portage Creek into Gulf Shores. Here, Waterville USA, the famous Blalock Seafood store, and Lulu's Seafood, plus multiple high-rise condominiums come into view. The route junctions with SR 180 and hits the last stretch of regular stores in the area before reaching SR 182, also known as the famous Alabama's Coastal Connection, which is its southern terminus.

The mountain can be seen from the Valley of the Ten Peaks. Mount Babel was first climbed by A Hart, Edward Oliver Wheeler, L. Wilson and H. Worsfold in 1910. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Babel is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Babel is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 C. Tower of Babel Tower of Babel The Tower of Babel is a conspicuous quartzite monolith at the northern end of the mountain, and is apparent to park visitors at Moraine Lake. It was named in 1899 by Walter D. Wilcox because its profile reminded him of the biblical Tower of Babel. The first ascent of the tower was made in 1959 by G. Boles, B. Greenwood, and A. Washington. Mount Babel acquired its name from its outlier tower that rises above Moraine Lake.

Today the sports club no longer fields a football side and has departments for badminton, basketball, cheerleading, dancing, fencing, handball, Judo, Karate, pool-billiards, rhythmic gymnastics, rugby union, skating, Taekwon-do, and volleyball. The club was formed as ABTS Bremen in 1920 out of the union of football club Bremer SC 1891, gymnastics club ATV 1860 Bremen, and aquatics club Bremer Schwimm-Club. This combined association fielded competitive sides in the Westkreisliga/Bezirksliga Weser-Jade through the 1920s, capturing a league title in 1922. ABTS was bankrupted in 1929 and re-formed as Sportfreund 85/91 Bremen. Spfr Bremen briefly played top-flight football from 1942 to the end of World War II in the Gauliga Weser-Ems. The Gauliga Weser-Ems had emerged from the split of the Gauliga Niedersachsen, one of the top-flight divisions formed in the earlier re-organization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933. After World War II most organizations in Germany, including sport and football clubs, were disbanded by the order of occupying Allied authorities.

The club immediately impressed with a strong second-place finish and went on to earn a number of top three finishes through the early 1950s, including championships in 1953, 1954, and 1955. Their performance faded and they become just a mid-table side in the years leading up to the formation of Germany's first professional football league ‚Äì the Bundesliga ‚Äì in 1963 and in 1968 ATSV was relegated. The team recovered to some degree and returned to Amateurliga play in 1970 until again being relegated in 1974. ATSV made a single season appearance in the Verbandsliga Bremen in 1986‚Äì87.

Route description SR 332 begins at an intersection with SR 53 (Main Street) in Hoschton in Jackson County. It travels to the east on Pendergrass Road, and leaves the city limits of town before crossing over Indian Creek. It curves to the north-northeast, passes northwest of the Traditions of Braselton Golf Club, and intersects SR 124\\\\. It continues to the north-northeast, where it crosses over, but does not have an interchange with, Interstate 85 (I-85). After a northeast curve and a crossing of Holders Creek, the highway enters Pendergrass. Almost immediately, SR 332 curves to the north-northwest until it intersects North Old Gainesville Highway. Here, the route turns to the southeast and curves to the east to an intersection with US 129/SR 11 (Civil War Hearland Leaders Trail). The three highway travel concurrently northwest to an intersection with Main Street just east of Talmo. It travels to the southwest and enters Talmo. Almost immediately, it curves to the northwest. It passes the Talmo Cemetery and the Talmo Public Library. SR 332 then begins a zigzag route to the northwest, entering Hall County and alternating to the southwest and the north. Southeast of Belmont, SR 332 begins a concurrency with SR 60 (Candler Road). In Belmont, they intersect the eastern terminus of SR 211 (Tanners Mill Road). In Candler, SR 332 splits off to the west-southwest, following Poplar Springs Road. The route crosses Walnut Creek again and continues in a general northwest direction to meet its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 13 (Atlanta Highway) in the southeast part of Oakwood. The route's northern terminus is about from having a second intersection with SR 53. The only part of SR 332 that is part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility, is the segment that is concurrent with US 129/SR 11 in the Pendergrass‚ÄìTalmo area. History The roadway that would eventually be designated as SR 332 was established at least as far back as 1919 as a part of SR 11, which traveled from Jefferson to Gainesville. By the end of 1926, US 129 had been designated along this highway. In 1942, this entire length of US 129/SR 11 was paved. By the middle of 1955, an unnumbered roadway was constructed between the Braselton area and Gainesville. By the middle of 1960, this roadway was designated as SR 60. By the middle of 1963, SR 332 was built, and paved, from its southern terminus to its current southern intersection with SR 60. Prior to 1966, SR 332 was extended to its northern terminus in Oakwood, with the segment from the intersection with Weaver Road, southwest of Candler, to Oakwood, paved.

Air Service. is a mathematical relationship for predicting the off-axis uniaxial compressive strength of wood. The formula can also be used to compute the fiber stress or the stress wave velocity at the elastic limit as a function of grain angle in wood. For a wood that has uniaxial compressive strengths of \\\\sigma_0 parallel to the grain and \\\\sigma_{90} perpendicular to the grain, Hankinson's equation predicts that the uniaxial compressive strength of the wood in a direction at an angle \\\\alpha to the grain is given by : \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha = \\\\cfrac{\\\\sigma_0~\\\\sigma_{90}}{\\\\sigma_0~\\\\sin^2\\\\alpha + \\\\sigma_{90}~\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} Even though the original relation was based on studies of spruce, Hankinson's equation has been found to be remarkably accurate for many other types of wood. A generalized form of the Hankinson formula has also been used for predicting the uniaxial tensile strength of wood at an angle to the grain. This formula has the formClouston, P., 1995, The Tsai-Wu strength theory for Douglas fir laminated veneer, M. S.

From the last quarter of the nineteenth century, he used his wealth to promote public interest in symphonic and \\"semi-classical\\" music by helping to form and establish the Oratorio Society of New York and funding construction of the Naumburg Bandshell, which honors his name, on the Concert Ground of the Central Park Mall.The New York Times, February 19, 1989. Biography Naumburg was born to a Jewish family in Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, in 1835, and emigrated with his parents to the United States at age 15 to escape the growing anti-Semitism of his native land. He settled first in Baltimore, where he took a liking to chamber music. An amateur pianist with no formal training, he was unable at that time to afford purchasing concert tickets for famous performers like Vieuxtemps and Thalberg. In 1853, at age 18, he moved to New York City, where he initiated a business career that was first highlighted as a successful merchant and then a merchant banker. He founded E. Naumburg & Co. in 1893 - one of the largest 'commercial paper' banks on Wall Street. Their chief rival was Goldman Sachs.The New Yorker, December 7, 1957 pp.42-44 The parlor of his Manhattan townhouse hosted pianists, opera singers and string quartets, and soon became a forum for celebrities of the music field. With his success he chose to make access to fine music available to a broader public in New York, as one of his principal legacies. In 1873, Leopold Damrosch founded the Oratorio Society of New York in the 'back parlor' of Elkan Naumburg's 48th Street home. Bertha Wehle Naumburg (1843‚Äì97), Elkan's wife, gave it that name. Elkan, Bertha and Leopold were very good friends, and like Leopold, Elkan also gave one of his son's the name Walter. Elkan probably helped to form the group and he served briefly on its board, when it first began.NYT's May 31, 1955, Walter W. Naumburg's speech at the public unveiling of a plaque dedication ceremony on the Naumburg Bandshell honoring his father, Elkan, and the 50th anniversary of the concerts summer season, before 4,000 people Richard Arnold, Leopold Damrosch, Marcella Sembrich, Theodore Thomas, and others performed weekly in the Naumburg family parlor during the 1870s, 80s, and 90s, entertaining such Gilded Age critics and artists as Henry Theophilus Finck and Albert Henry Krehbiel. In 1890, Elkan Naumburg founded the New York Philharmonic's first pension fund. Later he helped introduce renowned conductors like Vasily Ilyich Safonov and Willem Mengelberg to that orchestra. He soon got the idea of presenting free symphonic concerts in Central Park. Patterned after concerts conducted by Theodore Thomas in the Central Park Garden, the Naumburg Concerts commenced in 1905 and have continued without interruption ever since, almost always in Central Park. Today, they are the world's oldest continuous free outdoor classical music concert series. Originally performed on Central Park's Mall in an octagonal, pagoda-shaped bandstand designed by Jacob Wrey Mould, the programs featured popular waltzes, abbreviated operas, one or two movements of a symphony, or short arias, performed for audiences of strolling or picnicking Manhattanites, many of whom took to dancing as dusk fell and the gas lights came on. In 1912, the old wood and cast iron bandstand was deemed inadequate, so Naumburg offered the city $125,000 to build a new bandshell of cast and Indiana limestone details. His nephew, the architect William Gabriel Tachau (1875-1969), designed the structure‚Äîan innovative half-dome on a high section of drum, which later came into frequent use‚Äîin 1916. Building began in 1921, and it opened on September 29, 1923, with a 60-piece orchestra conducted by Franz Kaltenborn playing selections from \\"Aida\\" and \\"Carmen\\", the William Tell Overture, the Blue Danube Waltz, and movements from Beethoven‚Äôs Fifth Symphony and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The concert closed with a new march‚Äî\\"On the Mall\\"‚Äîby Edwin Franko Goldman, dedicated to 88-year-old Elkan Naumburg, who was in attendance. Personal life and death Naumburg was married to Bertha Wehle. In 1924, Elkan Naumburg died and is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. His sons Walter Wehle Naumburg (married to ornithologist Elsie Margaret Binger Naumburg) and George Washington Naumburg (married to Ruth Morgenthau, daughter of Henry Morgenthau Sr.) https://www.henrymorgenthaupreserve.org/ continued the free concerts in Central Park.See http://www.naumburgconcerts.org/ and History & Archives, 100th Anniversary - A Booklet His son Walter continued and augmented the family tradition of supporting classical music by establishing the Walter W. Naumburg Prize in 1926. When he died, in 1959, the perpetuation of both the free Naumburg Orchestral Concerts in Central Park and the Walter W. Naumburg Prize were endowed by a provision in his will. Elkan's grandniece, Eleanor Naumburg Sanger, later co-founded WQXR-FM with her husband Elliott Sanger, New York's classical music radio station, and Elkan's grandson Philip Henry Naumburg helped found the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.

Freisa is a vigorous and productive vine whose round, blue-black grapes are harvested in early October. The three-lobed leaves are relatively small and the bunches are elongated in form. By the 1880s it had become one of the major Piedmontese grapes, and in that period its cultivation was stimulated by the vine‚Äôs resistance to the downy mildew caused by the Plasmopara viticola fungus. Wines made from the Freisa grape are red and usually somewhat sweet and lightly sparkling, or foaming. Still and fully sparkling versions are also produced, however, as are dry and more decidedly sweet styles. In the Canavese there is also a ros√© which can be made primarily from Freisa according to Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulations. History Plantings of Freisa in the Piedmont region date back to at least the 18th century and ampelographers believe that the grape likely originated there in the hills between Asti and Turin.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 90 Harcourt Books 2001 Recent DNA profiling by the University of California, Davis revealed that Freisa has a parent- offspring relationship with Nebbiolo. There are two major clonal varieties of Freisa-a small berried clone known as Freisa Piccolo which is more widely planted and a larger berry Freisa Grossa or Freisa di Nizza that tends to be planted on flatter, fertile terrain and produced less distinguished wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 286 Oxford University Press 2006 Freisa di Chieri is potentially its own sub-variety of Freisa Piccolo grown in the Chieri region and distinguished by its own DOC. It creates a very perfumed, deep colored and tannic wine. Relationship to other grapes Through its parent-offspring relationship with Nebbiolo, Freisa is a half-sibling of several Piemontese wine grape varieties including: Vespolina, Brugnola, Bubbierasco, Nebbiolo ros√©, Negretta, Neretto di Bairo and Rossola nera.Ian D'Agata Native Wine Grapes of Italy, pg 476 University of California Press 2014 Viticulture Freisa is a vigorous and productive vine whose round, blue-black grapes are harvested in early October. The three- lobed leaves are relatively small and the bunches are elongated in form. The vine is highly resistance to peronospora but has some susceptibility to oidium. It grows best in well exposed, sunny sites on hillsides.Robinson, Jancis Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 209-210 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Wines Similar to Nebbiolo, Freisa produces wines with considerable tannins and acidity. While it can be used in blends, it is most often encountered as a varietal. Traditionally Freisa was produced as a slightly sparkling wine with some noticeable sweetness. To balance the bitterness from the grape and aging on its lees, the wines would be made with a small amount of residual sugar and allowed to go through a secondary fermentation to create a limited amount of frothiness. This bitter/sweet dynamic has brought Freisa its share of fans and critics with wine experts such Hugh Johnson describing the wine as being \\"immensely appetizing\\" to Robert M. Parker, Jr. describing Freisa as producing \\"totally repugnant wines\\". Modern winemaking technology has introduced techniques to minimize some of the bitter tannins and ferment the wine fully dry. These include temperature control fermentation vessels and aging in oak barrels. Like Nebbiolo, Freisa produces a relatively light colored wine but with more distinctive purple hues. The wines are often characterized with strawberry, raspberry and violet aromas. Freisa Nebbiolata Freisa Nebbiolata is a specialty wine of the Piedmont region made in a ripasso style. In this style, the Fresia must is fermented with left over Nebbiolo skins from the production of Barolo. This creates a highly tannic wine with the potential for complex flavors. Wine regions Freisa is seen rarely outside of its Piedmont homeland, though there are a few hundred acres of the vine planted in Argentina carried over to South America by Italian immigrants. Even within Piedmont its acreage is declining. It is most commonly found in the Asti, Langhe, Monferrato and Pinerolese regions.

The total length of this highway is 700 km, and is the third National Highway passing through the state of Manipur, together with old NH 53 and old NH 39. This highway has been proposed to connect three bordering states in Northeast India, viz. Mizoram (141 km), Manipur (523 km) and Nagaland (36 km). The highway stretch starts from Seling (NH 54) in Mizoram through Tipaimukh-Imphal-Ukhrul-Jessami in Manipur and terminates at a junction with NH-53 in Nagaland (km 0 at Kohima).  Repairs and Construction  The development of this National Highway had been projected to be under the \\"Prime Minister‚Äôs agenda for socio-economic development of North Eastern Region\\" which was announced in January 2000. The PM‚Äôs agenda envisages a total investment of Rs. 91 billion. It comprises 27 projects ranging from rural infrastructure development projects, irrigation and educational infrastructure development to strengthening of internal security, besides horticulture and IT development etc. It has also been reported that the entire stretch of National Highway-150 will be a double lane highway and included in the approved 10th plan programme of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. In August 2004, Union Minister of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Shri T.R. Baalu met the Northeast states respective ministers-in-charge, ministry and BRO officials and approved fresh proposals worth Rs. 65 billion for fast track development of nearly 2,000 km National Highways and Roads in the Northeast. During the meeting, it was also decided to provide medians on NH-150 for increasing safety.  Implementing agency  The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has been entrusted for taking up improvement and construction work of the 262 km long stretch from Tipaimukh to Churachandpur and 175 km from Yaingangpokpi (488 km) to Jessami (63 km). The stretch from Churachandpur to Yaingangpokpi, a total of 86 km is entrusted to the Manipur state Public Work Department (PWD).  Delays in construction  In spite of the Tipaimukh Road been declared a National Highway, no visible construction and maintenance work with the highway has been carried out for the last more than ten years. Project work at this significant route has been abandoned since. The road constructors left the then Tipaimukh Road in 1987. This negligence on the part of the state and central government to improve the only transportation route for the Tipaimukh people in Manipur has taken its toll. The unconcern policy adopted by the government has adversely affected socio-economic livelihood of the remote villages in terms of being unable to market their forest products and buying of their essential commodity needs. This alienation affected not only the road project but also the overall development of the region. Thus, resulting in the region been completely cut off from other parts of the state and the pitiable condition of the people getting more worsened each year.  Current condition of the road  Even before the highway was declared a National Highway, it normally took around a day to travel to or from the Tipaimukh to the district town of Churachandpur which is around 270 km. Then, regular state buses plied from Churachandpur town to Tipaimukh on daily basis and people, goods and news reached Tipaimukh in a day. But the road remained disused for a prolonged period due to establishment of United National Liberation Front training camps. Nearly all movement of vehicles stopped and no Government representative could visit the area beyond Bungmual village. In 2005, Indian army launched an operation and cleared the entire region of militant groups and the development has since then started by Border Roads Task Force (BRTF), an Indian army Road construction task force. Currently, starting from Churachandpur, up to 50 km stone the road is nearly complete. Considerable vehicles have started plying and the state of development in the region is also undergoing a major change.  Security issues  According to the state government, the reconstruction and upgrading work of National Highway-150 had been stalled due to security related issues faced by the implementing agencies from various insurgent groups who actively operate in the area. In regard to the security issue, the Central government said that the law and order situation inside the state is the responsibility of the state government and so the financial requirement for security protection to the implementing agencies should be borne from the state‚Äôs budget. But the state government insisted that it cannot by itself meet the huge financial demands of the security protection. A number of high level meetings have also been held between the state and central government to address this issue. The Ministry of Home Affairs has been reported to even intimidate that the required security will be provided to the Manipur government so as to facilitate improvement and widening of the Highway expeditiously.  Recent progress  Manipur CM Ibobi Singh, while addressing the Assembly on 5 July 2005 during a discussion on the indefinite highway blockade on NH-39 called by the All Naga Students Association of Manipur (ANSAM), stated that the NH 150 was being developed as an alternative supply line against the backdrop of frequent bandhs and blockade called by different organisations and that it will be completed within the financial year. The 42 days long economic blockade on NH-39 in 2005 prompted the Manipur cabinet to approve the construction of NH-150 bypass to Jiribam via Taithu on 16 August 2005 which is to be done jointly by the state government and the BRO. In the ensuing weeks, 25 Border Roads Task Force (BRTF) stationed at Imphal were said to be entrusted with the task of constructing NH-150 from Churachandpur. The deadline for the completion of the construction of 20 km stretch of road from Churachandpur was set to March, 2006. In 2005, Manipur CS Jarnail Singh was summoned by the Centre and a meeting was reportedly held on 17 October 2006 with regards to the construction of NH-150. In his address at the Manipur Assembly on 22 February 2006, the Governor said that the improvement of NH-150 from Churachandpur to Yaingangpokpi is in good progress. He also stated that the BRTF has also started improvement of NH-150 to Tipaimukh in Churachandpur district. The CM of Manipur on his tour to Thanlon and Tipaimukh areas on 3 April 2006 assured the villagers that the repair work on NH-150 connecting Imphal to Aizawl would be taken up very soon. Manipur Governor SS Sidhu on his visit to the areas on 10 March 2006 also said that work on NH-150 will be taken up very soon and will be made motorable by the end of 2006.

The Crayford focuser is a simplified focusing mechanism for amateur astronomical telescopes. Crayford focusers are considered superior to entry-level rack and pinion focusers, normally found in this type of device. Instead of the rack and pinion, they have a smooth spring-loaded shaft which holds the focus tube against four opposing bearing surfaces, and controls its movement. It is named after the Crayford Manor House Astronomical Society, Crayford, London, England, where it was invented by John Wall, a member of the astronomical society which meets there. The original Crayford Focuser is on display there. The Crayford focuser was initially demonstrated to the Crayford Manor House Astronomical Society, and then descriptions were published in The Journal of the British Astronomical Association (February 1971),Cox, R. E. and Sinnott, R. W. \\"The Crayford Eyepiece Mounting\\", Sky and Telescope, September 1974, pp. 182‚Äì183 Model Engineer magazine (May 1972) Original Model Engineer construction article (with full constructional plans), and Sky & Telescope magazine (September 1972). John Wall decided not to patent the idea, effectively donating it to the amateur astronomical community. Crayfords began to be popular among amateur telescope makers for being easy to make without any high precision machining, yet providing precise focusing with no gear slop or backlash. This trend picked up steam as commercial Crayfords, while being relatively inexpensive, proved to be superior to most rack-and-pinion devices. They became the default focusing device on many amateur telescopes just above entry level, and better. They are made in a variety of designs by companies specializing in amateur telescope supplies, with such features as dual speed focusing and interface to motorized, or robotic, focusing. The concept The Crayford focuser design is reminiscent of the Dobsonian design for telescopes, since instead of precision machining, it relies on geometry to preclude any wobble or backlash . The Crayford is similar in appearance to a Rack and pinion focuser, but has no teeth on either the rack or the pinion. Instead, a round axle is pressed (for example by a spring-loaded or thumbscrew-tightened piece of PTFE plastic) against a flat on the side of the focuser drawtube, relying only on friction to move the drawtube as the axle is turned. This also presses the drawtube against a set of four ball bearings against which it moves smoothly with minimal friction. The pressure exerted on the axle can often be adjusted for smoothest operation, and the drawtube may be locked in position to support heavy eyepieces or cameras. Subsequently, variations on the Crayford focuser concept have emerged, e.g. a helical Crayford where the drawtube is pressed against four tilted ball bearings, and focusing action is accomplished by rotating the drawtube.

It was released in 2003 on Rough Trade Records and on vinyl in 2015 on Don Giovanni Records. Reception \\"At first, Jeffrey Lewis‚Äô songs seem like jokes. His voice sounds nerdy, the lyrics ramble nonsensically and the guitar chords are the most primitive you've probably heard since grade-school music camp. But stick with it long enough and the payoff comes in smart and detailed narratives that nail the human condition. Lewis made his debut in 2002 with ‚ÄúThe Last Time I Did Acid I Went Insane and Other Favorites.‚Äù The latest CD, recorded with his brother Jack, on bass, boasts the equally fetching title above. On both records, Lewis‚Äô primitivist music and surreal lyrics recall ‚Äò60s folk satirists the Fugs and David Peel. In fact, the songwriter sprang from the ‚Äúanti-folk‚Äù movement which recalls those East Village performers. Lewis also has a career as an underground comic-book artist. Like his drawings, his music is witty, animated and true.\\" ‚Äì Jim Farber, New York Daily News, August 9, 2002 \\"There‚Äôs no doubt ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs The Ones Who‚Äôve Cracked That The Light Shines Through‚Äô will end up in Best Of 2003 lists everywhere come the end of the year. Because it really is a genuinely superb record ‚Äì sharp, dry and wry, it should make Lewis (who's also a comic book writer) famous. And this despite its simple approach to musicianship - mostly it's just Jeffrey and his guitar. Immediately striking is the wit embedded in the opening number, ‚ÄòBack When I Was 4‚Äô, you'll laugh out loud or die trying not to, and from there on in will be bowled over by some acute observations and unusual warmth. He weaves his tales of growing up particularly well, and such yarns can't help but connect. There are elements of Loudon Wainwright III, Tenacious D and Bright Eyes here, though it's Lewis‚Äô individualism that's really the key. Inspired stuff.\\" - (4 stars of 5) Barfly \\"As Bob Dylan proved early in his career, there‚Äôs a very fine line between outsider folk and a comedy record. The shaggy dog, talking blues about post-apocalyptic monkeys and farmers‚Äô daughters from Another Side Of may have sunk to the bottom of Dylan's catalog, but their rambunctious goofiness shines on in Jeffrey Lewis, one of a new generation of New York anti-folksters. On his second full-length for Rough Trade, the 27-year-old cartoonist brings his cracking voice to bear on the pressing issues of the age: rampaging ghouls, towers of turtles and the fact that no, he doesn't want to do any acid, thank you. The wackiness of Cracked is charming, but the real highlights of the record are songs where Lewis turns his wide-eyed language on more personal matters. ‚ÄúI hope that the art school enjoys your big painting of ruin,‚Äù he sighs on ‚ÄúAlphabet.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all got good things to do, and it‚Äôs good when we do them.‚Äù Packed with these strangely perfect bons mots and buoyed by a heroically unhip sense of wonder, Lewis‚Äô lyrics are as tight as his guitar playing is weak. But so what if his musicianship has all the finesse of a dorm-floor sing-along? Lewis specializes in a rambling, autobiographical style that reassures and entertains more than it startles or amazes. It's good, but not great, and Lewis will likely never quite get around to penning his Blowin' in the Wind or My Back Pages. But the stories on Cracked are bright, funny and warm-hearted. Sometimes, that's more than enough. \\" - MAGNET Jeffrey Lewis stated in an interview with Audio Antihero Records that \\"It seems like a lot of people say that ‚ÄúThe Ones Who‚Äôve Cracked‚Äù is their preferred album, but to me that one feels too in-between, it's in-between being a lo-fi album and a nicer studio album.\\"http://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/interview-jeffrey-lewis/  Track listing  # \\"Back When I Was 4\\" # \\"Alphabet\\" # \\"No LSD Tonight\\" # \\"Don't Let the Record Label Take You Out to Lunch\\" # \\"Gold\\" # \\"Texas\\" # \\"Sea Song\\" # \\"Arrow\\" # \\"Zaster\\" # \\"If You Shoot the Head You Kill the Ghoul\\" # \\"I Saw a Hippie Girl on 8th Ave\\" # \\"Graveyard\\" # \\"You Don't Have to Be a Scientist to Do Experiments on Your Own Heart\\"  Information  The album and track title is similar to a lyrics in Leonard Cohen's \\"Anthem\\" on his 1992 album \\"The Future\\".

Historical footage, vintage photographs and interviews with a \\"who's who\\" list of musical giants from the worlds of jazz, soul and classic rock provide insight into the life of Dowd, whose creative spirit and passion for innovative technology helped shape the course of modern music. It was a 2005 Grammy Award nominee. A long-time engineer and producer for Atlantic Records, Dowd was responsible for some of the most important R&B;, rock, and jazz records ever made. In his own words, Dowd relates how he went from working on the Manhattan Project as rising physicist, while still high school age, to recording some of the greatest music ever made over the last half of the 20th century. His technical genius opened the door to modern music and made the studio a crucial element in the formula of musical artistry. His use of the multitrack eight-track tape recorder at Atlantic Records in the late 1950s not only added an amazing dimension to the sound of music (he is also credited with taking music recording from monaural to stereo), it also gave musicians and producers greater control over their musical productions and identities. For the first time, it was possible to isolate musical sounds and then manipulate (mix) its parts in the recording process. The movie Ray provides a demonstration of how Dowd's genius escalated musical artistry and revved up the popular music industry. In one scene, Dowd is shown in the studio directing the recording of Ray Charles' music for Atlantic Records executive Ahmet Ertegun. After Charles dismisses his backup singers, the Raelettes, because of tension with Margie Hendricks, the lead Raelette, Dowd plays back what has been recorded thus far and Charles instantly picks up a difference in the sound. Dowd explains the company's new eight-track console and Charles wastes no time exploiting it to his advantage. He instantly resumes the recording session by performing the required Raelettes' parts himself, assured that Dowd can mix each track to produce the final record. Dowd's impact on the careers of many esteemed, award-winning artists is a major part of the documentary. His gift for capturing and enhancing sound made him a treasure to musicians from all genres: John Coltrane, Charlie Mingus, Aretha Franklin, Bobby Darin, The Drifters, Eric Clapton, Cream, the Allman Brothers represent a tiny sample of artists who credit him with their recording success. Numerous interviews with these recording industry icons tell the story of this humble genius, chronicling the recording sessions and technical achievements that altered the course of contemporary music forever. Filmmaker Mark Moormann premiered this independently produced feature-length documentary at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and its international premiere at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. It has screened at festivals around the world to widespread critical acclaim. Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures has released the film in North America and the Caribbean and Lightning Entertainment is handling the foreign release of the film. Dowd died in 2002, shortly after this documentary was made.

The lake's name is taken from the extensive sugar maple forest that surrounds it. Even before American settlement of the region, the existence of these extensive hardwood forests in an otherwise treeless open prairie gave the lake a geographic identity. Maple Lake is a natural lake and the westernmost significant lake in the Red River Valley of Northwestern Minnesota. It appears on 19th-century maps of the area, and developed as a summer home and resort community as early as 1910. As a result of drought conditions and low inflows during the 1930s, however, the lake nearly dried up. Beginning in 1940 a two-stage Works Progress Administration development project involving the diversion of water from nearby Badger Lake and the Poplar River raised the lake to its current artificially maintained water level. This rejuvenated the resort industry, and the lake remains a popular summer home, recreational watersports and fishing lake, drawing people from eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota as well as other neighboring states.

He has spent the last 28 years as a Pac-10 Conference football official. He was the line judge during the 1982 Stanford-California game when \\"The Play\\" helped California win, 25-20. Many Stanford fans argue to this day that a forward lateral was made, and that a Cal player‚Äôs knee was down before his lateral, either of which by itself would have resulted in Stanford winning the game. Riese later worked as a referee in the Pac-10 and was the head of the officiating crew that worked the first Bowl Championship Series championship game, the Fiesta Bowl between Florida State and Tennessee on January 4, 1999. His final game on the field came on January 1, 2005 at the Fiesta Bowl between Pitt and Utah. On September 16, 2006 Riese served as the instant replay official of the University of Oklahoma-University of Oregon football game in Eugene, Oregon. During the final minutes of the game two plays were sent to his booth. The first was an onside kick by Oregon, which was ruled on the field to be a recovery by Oregon. The play went to the booth for review for the purpose of evaluating whether Oregon had illegally touched the ball before it had traveled 10 yards. Those watching the game at home were given multiple angles of the play, and many agreed with the broadcast commentators that Oregon had done so, which would give possession to the University of Oklahoma. Riese was unable to determine if Oregon had touched the ball prematurely from the end zone replay angle he was shown, but he saw that Allen Patrick of Oklahoma had actually recovered the ball. Since the actual recovery was not the purpose of the review, Mr. Riese was limited to providing information within the original scope of the review, even though the referee asked him which team had recovered the ball. This ended up being a game-changing call: after Oregon was awarded the ball, it went on to score a touchdown, winning the game by a score of 34-33. Had Oklahoma been awarded possession of the onside kick, it likely would have run out the clock for a victory. Following this incident, Riese was suspended, along with the rest of the officiating crew, for one game. After the incident, he requested and was granted a leave of absence for the remainder of the season. He was later quoted as saying, \\"I feel so bad I missed that call, it's driving me crazy,\\" and that he was \\"struggling\\" with his mistake. Riese claimed to have received death threats, and during an interview on September 18, 2006, he remarked that, \\"I can't sleep, I can't eat, my blood pressure is skyrocketing.\\" Riese was considering retirement following the end of the season as recommended by his doctors. In February 2007 the Pac-10 Conference demoted Riese from replay official to technical assistant.

Initially Group 5 regulations defined a Special Touring Car category and from 1970 to 1971 the classification was applied to limited production Sports Cars restricted to 5 litre engine capacity. The Group 5 Sports Car category was redefined in 1972 to exclude the minimum production requirement and limit engine capacity to 3 litres. From 1976 to 1982 Group 5 was for Special Production Cars, a liberal silhouette formula based on homologated production vehicles. 1st Generation Group 5 ‚Äì \\"Special Touring Cars\\" (1966 to 1969) In 1966 the FIA introduced a number of new racing categories including one for highly modified touring cars, officially known as Group 5 Special Touring Cars. The regulations permitted vehicle modifications beyond those allowed in the concurrent Group 1 and Group 2 Touring Car categories.M.L Twite, The World's Racing Cars, 1971, page 173 Group 5 regulations were adopted for the British Saloon Car Championship from 1966 and for the European Touring Car Championship from 1968.ETCC 1968-1969 : The Group 5 Years Retrieved from \\"Touring Car Racing History\\" on 12 January 2009 The Special Touring Cars category was discontinued after the 1969 season. 2nd Generation Group 5 - \\"Sports Cars\\" (1970 to 1971) Group 5 Porsche 917 competing in the 1970 International Championship for Makes For the 1970 season, the FIA applied the Group 5 classification to the Sports Car class which had previously been known as Group 4 Sports Cars. The minimum production requirement remained at 25 and the engine capacity maximum at 5 litres as had applied in the superseded Group 4. Group 5 Sports Cars contested the FIA's International Championship for Makes in 1970 & 1971, alongside the 3 litre Group 6 Prototype Sports Cars. During 1970 the FIA decided to replace the existing Group 5 Sports Car category when the rules expired at the end of the 1971 season, so the big 917s and 512s would have to be retired at the end of that year. Surprisingly, Ferrari decided to give up any official effort with the 512 in order to prepare for the new 1972 season regulations. But many 512s were still raced by private teams, most of them converted to M specification. As a result of the rule change, sports car racing popularity suffered and did not recover until the following decade, with the advent of Group C which incidentally were forced out of competition in favour of the 3.5 atmo engine formula, reminiscent of events nineteen years previous. Background to the 5 Litre Sports Car category  In an effort to reduce the speeds generated at Le Mans and other fast circuits of the day by the unlimited capacity Group 6 Prototypes such as the 7 litre Fords, and to entice manufacturers of 3 litre Formula One engines into endurance racing, the Commission Sportive Internationale (then the independent competition arm of the FIA) announced that the new International Championship for Makes would be run for Group 6 Sports-Prototypes limited to 3 litre capacity for the four years from 1968 through 1971. Well-aware that few manufacturers were ready to immediately take up the challenge, the CSI also allowed the participation of 5 litre Group 4 Sports Cars manufactured in quantities of at least 50 units. This targeted existing cars like the aging Ford GT40 and the newer Lola T70 coupe. In April 1968, the CSI announced that, as there were still too few entries in the 3 litres Group 6 Prototype category, the minimal production figure to compete in the Group 4 Sport category of the International Championship of Makes would be reduced from 50 to 25 starting in 1969 through to the planned end of the rules in 1971. This was mainly to allow the homologation in Group 4 of cars such as the Ferrari 250 LM and the Lola T70 which had not been manufactured in sufficient quantities to qualify (unless, in the case of the Lola T70, the open Can-Am cars were counted as well). Starting in July 1968, Porsche made a surprising and very expensive effort to take advantage of this rule. As they were rebuilding race cars with new chassis every race or two anyway, they decided to conceive, design and build 25 versions of a whole new car for the Sport category with one underlying goal: to win its first overall victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In only ten months the Porsche 917 was developed, based upon the Porsche 908, with remarkable technology: Porsche's first 12-cylinder engine, and many components made of titanium, magnesium and exotic alloys that had been developed for lightweight hillclimb racers. Other ways of weight reduction were rather simple, like a gear lever knob made of Balsa wood. When Porsche was first visited by the CSI inspectors only three cars were completed, while 18 were being assembled and seven additional sets of parts were present. Porsche argued that if they assembled the cars they would then have to take them apart again to prepare the cars for racing. The inspectors refused the homologation and asked to see 25 assembled and working cars. On April 20 Ferdinand Pi√´ch displayed 25 917s parked in front of the Porsche factory to the CSI inspectors. Pi√´ch even offered the opportunity to drive one of the cars, which was declined. During June 1969, Enzo Ferrari sold half of his stock to FIAT, and used some of that money to do what Porsche did 6 months earlier with the 917, to build 25 cars powered by a 5-litre V12 in order to compete against them. With the financial help of Fiat, that risky investment was made, and surplus cars were intended to be sold to racing customers to compete for the 1970 season. Within 9 months Ferrari manufactured 25 512S cars. Ferrari entries only consisted of the factory cars, tuned by SpA SEFAC and there were the private cars of Scuderia Filipinetti, N.A.R.T., √âcurie Francorchamps, Scuderia Picchio Rosso, Gelo Racing Team and Escuderia Montjuich which not receive the same support from the factory. They were considered as field fillers, never as candidate for a win. At Porsche, however, JWA Gulf, KG Salzburg who were then replaced by Martini Racing for the following season, received all direct factory support and the privateers like AAW Shell Racing and David Piper Racing received a much better support than Ferrari's clients. The 917 instability problem was resolved with a revised rear hatch, which was called 917K (Kurzheck). There was a long tail version known as the 917LH (Langheck). Towards the end of the 1970 season, Ferrari entered some races with a new version of the 512, the 512M which had a revised bodywork 3rd Generation Group 5 ‚Äì \\"Sports Cars\\" (1972 to 1975) Group 5 Ferrari 312PB competing in the 1972 World Championship for Makes For 1972, the FIA applied the Group 5 classification to what had previously been known as the Group 6 Prototype Sports Cars category. These cars, now officially Group 5 Sports Cars, were limited to a 3-litre engine capacity and were to be the main competitors in events counting towards the FIA's newly renamed World Championship for Makes from 1972 to 1975. Unlike the old Group 5, there was no minimum production requirement. 4th Generation Group 5 ‚Äì \\"Special Production Cars\\" (1976 to 1982) Lancia Beta Montecarlo contesting the 1980 World Championship for Makes in the Group 5 category. For the 1976 season the FIA introduced a new Group 5 \\"Special Production Car\\" category, allowing extensive modifications to production based vehicles which were homologated in FIA Groups 1 through 4. These cars would contest the World Championship for Makes series from 1976 through to 1980 and then the World Endurance Championship in 1981 & 1982\\\\. The FIA rules restricted the width of the car, therefore cars were built with standard body widths but wide mudguard extensions. The regulation required only the bonnet, roof, doors and rail panel were left unmodified. The rules however did not mention headlight heights, therefore when Porsche originally were to enter the 935 with the production headlight, they read the rules and discovered the loophole, therefore they raced the 935 with the hallmark flat nose. The category was also mostly associated with the wide boxy wheel arches and extravagant body style. The category would be banished after 1982 in favour of the Group B regulation, but continued to compete in JSPC, IMSA GTX category and other national sports car racing championships for a few more years. The only non-circuit events that used Group 5 cars were in the Giro D'Italia Automobilistico rally. In Japan, the wide arch boxy with extended front spoiler body style is still favoured amongst kaido racer/silhouette car drivers, impersonators of the former and fans of the body style, who usually build a more exaggerated body style.

In chunked transfer encoding, the data stream is divided into a series of non-overlapping \\"chunks\\". The chunks are sent out and received independently of one another. No knowledge of the data stream outside the currently-being-processed chunk is necessary for both the sender and the receiver at any given time. Each chunk is preceded by its size in bytes. The transmission ends when a zero-length chunk is received. The chunked keyword in the Transfer-Encoding header is used to indicate chunked transfer. An early form of the chunked transfer encoding was proposed in 1994. Chunked transfer encoding is not supported in HTTP/2, which provides its own mechanisms for data streaming. Rationale The introduction of chunked encoding provided various benefits: * Chunked transfer encoding allows a server to maintain an HTTP persistent connection for dynamically generated content. In this case, the HTTP Content-Length header cannot be used to delimit the content and the next HTTP request/response, as the content size is not yet known. Chunked encoding has the benefit that it is not necessary to generate the full content before writing the header, as it allows streaming of content as chunks and explicitly signaling the end of the content, making the connection available for the next HTTP request/response. * Chunked encoding allows the sender to send additional header fields after the message body. This is important in cases where values of a field cannot be known until the content has been produced, such as when the content of the message must be digitally signed. Without chunked encoding, the sender would have to buffer the content until it was complete in order to calculate a field value and send it before the content. Applicability For version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol, the chunked transfer mechanism is considered to be always and anyway acceptable, even if not listed in the TE (transfer encoding) request header field, and when used with other transfer mechanisms, should always be applied last to the transferred data and never more than one time. This transfer coding method also allows additional entity header fields to be sent after the last chunk if the client specified the \\"trailers\\" parameter as an argument of the TE field. The origin server of the response can also decide to send additional entity trailers even if the client did not specify the \\"trailers\\" option in the TE request field, but only if the metadata is optional (i.e. the client can use the received entity without them). Whenever the trailers are used, the server should list their names in the Trailer header field; three header field types are specifically prohibited from appearing as a trailer field: Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length and Trailer. Format If a field with a value of \\"\\" is specified in an HTTP message (either a request sent by a client or the response from the server), the body of the message consists of an unspecified number of chunks, a terminating chunk, trailer, and a final CRLF sequence (i.e. carriage return followed by line feed). Each chunk starts with the number of octets of the data it embeds expressed as a hexadecimal number in ASCII followed by optional parameters (chunk extension) and a terminating CRLF sequence, followed by the chunk data. The chunk is terminated by CRLF. If chunk extensions are provided, the chunk size is terminated by a semicolon and followed by the parameters, each also delimited by semicolons. Each parameter is encoded as an extension name followed by an optional equal sign and value. These parameters could be used for a running message digest or digital signature, or to indicate an estimated transfer progress, for instance. The terminating chunk is a regular chunk, with the exception that its length is zero. It is followed by the trailer, which consists of a (possibly empty) sequence of entity header fields. Normally, such header fields would be sent in the message's header; however, it may be more efficient to determine them after processing the entire message entity. In that case, it is useful to send those headers in the trailer. Header fields that regulate the use of trailers are TE (used in requests), and Trailers (used in responses). Use with compression HTTP servers often use compression to optimize transmission, for example with or . If both compression and chunked encoding are enabled, then the content stream is first compressed, then chunked; so the chunk encoding itself is not compressed, and the data in each chunk is not compressed individually. The remote endpoint then decodes the stream by concatenating the chunks and uncompressing the result. Example Encoded data In the following example, three chunks of length 4, 5 and 14 (hexadecimal \\"E\\") are shown. The chunk size is transferred as a hexadecimal number followed by \\\\r as a line separator, followed by a chunk of data of the given size. 4\\\\r (bytes to send) Wiki\\\\r (data) 5\\\\r (bytes to send) pedia\\\\r (data) 3\\\\r (bytes to send) in\\\\r (data) 8\\\\r (bytes to send) chunks.\\\\r (data) 0\\\\r (final byte - 0) \\\\r (end message) Note: the chunk size indicates the size of the chunk data and excludes the trailing CRLF (\\"\\\\r \\"). In this particular example, the CRLF following \\"in\\" are counted as two octets toward the chunk size of 0xE (14). The CRLF in its own line are also counted as two octets toward the chunk size. The period character at the end of \\"chunks\\" is the 14th character, so it is the last data character in that chunk. The CRLF following the period is the trailing CRLF, so it is not counted toward the chunk size of 0xE (14). Decoded data Wikipedia in chunks.

Milton, Roy, Roy Milton and his Solid Senders, The Legends of Specialty Series, Specialty Records, SPCD 7004 liner notes From the late 1920s, he led a band called the Royal Entertainers, and eventually began touring more widely, and recording. Supported by Bob Wills, Fields' band became the first African-American band to play at the landmark Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa. In 1939, he was invited to New York City by John Hammond to record for the Vocalion label, and began to tour nationally. He did not become a star, but continued to work steadily, recording for smaller labels, and gradually transforming his sound through a smaller band and a repertoire shift from big band, swing to R&B.; During World War II, he entertained troops both at home and abroad. Later career He continued to straddle these styles into the 1950s, playing swing standards such as \\"Tuxedo Junction\\" and \\"Begin the Beguine\\" in a rocking R&B; style. In the late 1950s he moved to Los Angeles, joining Rendezvous Records, for whom he ran the house band. This included pianist Ernie Freeman, guitarist Rene Hall (who had previously worked with Fields in the 1930s), saxophonist Plas Johnson, and drummer Earl Palmer. In 1959 this band had an international hit with an R&B; version of Glenn Miller's \\"In the Mood\\", credited to the Ernie Fields Orchestra, which reached number 4 on the Billboard chart. The track also peaked at number 13 in the UK Singles Chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The band, with minor changes of personnel, went on to record instrumentals under many different names, including B. Bumble and the Stingers, the Marketts and the Routers.

The pƒÅ itself comprises approximately 70 households, a school, a meetinghouse of the LDS Church, two marae (Korongata Marae and a later addition in 1984 of the Mangaroa Marae), a cemetery, a disused quarry, and the 140-year-old historical Homestead of the Puriri Family. The population was 184 in 1996, increasing to 213 in 2001. Bridge PƒÅ is situated on flat land on the Heretaunga Plains with the major geographical feature of the township being the Karewarewa Stream. Located on the edge of an unconfined aquifer, the surrounding land is free- draining and is used for sheep grazing, horticulture and wine production. The surrounding area includes Hastings Aerodrome, two golf clubs, a car club, and a Deer Stalkers hall. As well as the main settlement centred on the intersection of Maraekakaho Road and Raukawa Road, a satellite settlement is located on Ngatarawa Road (near the Valentine Road corner) and on State Highway 50 (near the corner with Maraekakaho Road in the shadow of Roy's Hill). A relatively large tract of the surrounding rural area (up to 5 km from the pƒÅ) is also classified as Bridge PƒÅ by local authorities and the White Pages. The main road through the town is limited to 50 km/h and traffic is slowed through a variety of traffic calming measures. There is no sewerage. There is metropolitan style water reticulation. Wastewater is treated via individual homeowner septic tanks. The rural setting experiences between -3 ¬∞C frosts in winter (usually clearing to clear crisp days) to 40¬∞C heat in late summer. Bridge PƒÅ is approximately 20km from the coast, and with the central North Island mountain ranges of the Ruahines and Kawekas to intercept the prevailing westerly winds, the region enjoys a Mediterranean climate with around 2350 sunshine hours per annum and very low humidity. Bridge Pa Triangle Bridge Pa Triangle is a grape growing area roughly delineated by three roads: Ngatarawa Road, State Highway 50 and Maraekakaho Road. It is recognised as a premium wine growing area in the Hawke‚Äôs Bay wine region. Wines grown include Merlot, Syrah, Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. In ancient times the area was blanketed by the pumice tephra of numerous Taupo volcanic events. Much of the Triangle area covers the historical (pre-1860s earthquake) riverbed of the nearby Ngaruroro River. As such soil types include Ngatarawa Gravels, Takapau Silty-loam (free draining red metal of mixed alluvial and volcanic origin) and shallow clay-loam soils with underlying deep free draining pumice. Alwyn Corban and Garry Glazebrook of Ngatarawa Wines pioneered wine production in the area in the 1980s and it is only with the growth of other boutique wineries in the late 1990s the \\"Bridge Pa Triangle\\" has been delineated and named. The area is also sometimes described as The Maraekakaho Triangle and The Ngatarawa Triangle. Bordering Ngatarawa Road and to the north of the area along State Highway 50 is the Gimblett Gravels wine growing area. Marae Bridge PƒÅ has two marae. KorongatƒÅ Marae and Nukanoa meeting house is a meeting place of the NgƒÅti Kahungunu hap≈´ of NgƒÅti P≈çporo and NgƒÅti WhatuiƒÅpiti. Mangaroa Marae and Hikawera II meeting house is a meeting place of the NgƒÅti Kahungunu hap≈´ of NgƒÅti P≈çporo and NgƒÅti Rahunga. In October 2020, the Government committed $6,020,910 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade a group of 18 marae, including both KorongatƒÅ and Mangaroa.

George or Giorgos or Giorgis or Georgios Pavlopoulos as known in the literature field, was born in Pyrgos, on the west coast of the Peloponnese in Greece. Before World War II Pyrgos was a rich provincial centre and Pavlopoulos's father ran a local restaurant and cake shop. He was educated at primary and secondary levels in Pyrgos, a childhood illness left him permanently lame.Levi, Peter (1980). The Hill of Kronos. London: Arrow Books. . pp63f.

He did not complete his degree and returned to Pyrgos where he worked as book-keeper and secretary for the local bus company.Levi, Peter in Pavlopoulos, George (1971). Trans. Peter Levi. The Cellar. London: Anvil Press Poetry. Upon his return from Athens he married a local girl and had a son called Haralabos. Childhood friends of his in Pyrgos included the musician Mikis Theodorakis and Takis Sinopoulos the poet. In 1943, during the German occupation, the local bishop allowed Pavlopoulos access to the cathedral printing press. With some of his school friends he printed and published a magazine called Odyssey containing his first published poem. This group included Takis Sinopoulos with whom he later wrote experimental cooperative poetry. The group performed a play, advertised with posters proclaiming Freedom or Death. The text was controversial and landed Pavlopoulos in trouble with the local Gestapo, who asked who had written it. Pavlopoulos had eventually to pretend that it was by Victor Hugo, although it had been written by themselves. The Nazi withdrawal at close of war lead to bitter fighting between factions in the resistance. The unhappiness of war and civil war is reflected in much of Pavlopoulos's poetry. His poetry has been translated into other languages, including: English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish. He has taken part in cultural festivals in Greece and elsewhere and is a founder member of the Greek Society of Authors. He died on 26 November 2008.

It is a sequel to Cider with Rosie which detailed his early life in Gloucestershire after the First World War. In this sequel Lee leaves the security of his Cotswold village of Slad in Gloucestershire to start a new life, at the same time embarking on an epic journey on foot. It is 1934, and Lee walks to London from his Cotswolds home. He lives by playing the violin and, later, labouring on a building site in London. After this work draws to a finish, and having picked up the Spanish for \\"Will you please give me a glass of water?\\", he decides to go to Spain. He scrapes together a living by playing his violin outside caf√©s, and sleeps at night in his blanket under the open sky or in cheap, rough posadas. For a year he tramps through Spain, from Vigo in the north to the south coast, where he is trapped by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. He is warmly welcomed by the Spaniards he meets and enjoys a generous hospitality even from the poorest villagers he encounters along the way.  Synopsis  In 1934 Laurie Lee leaves his home in Gloucestershire for London. He visits Southampton and first tries his luck at playing his violin in the street. His apprenticeship proves profitable and he decides to move eastwards. He makes his way along the south coast, and then turns inland and heads north for London. There he meets his half-American girlfriend, Cleo, who is the daughter of an anarchist. Cleo's father finds him a job as a labourer and he rent a rooms, but has to move on as the room is taken over by a prostitute. He lives in London for almost a year as a member of a gang of wheelbarrow pushers. Once the building nears completion he knows that his time is up and decides to go to Spain because he knows the Spanish for \\"Will you please give me a glass of water?\\" He lands in Galicia in July 1935. Joining up with three young German musicians, he accompanies them around Vigo and then they split up outside Zamora. By August 1935 he reaches Toledo, where he has a meeting with the South African poet Roy Campbell and his family, whom he comes across while playing his violin. They invite him to stay in their house. By the end of September Lee reaches the sea. Then he comes to the Sierra Morena mountains. He decides to turn west and follow the Guadalquivir, adding several months to his journey, and taking him to the sea in a roundabout way. He turns eastwards, heading along the bare coastal shelf of Andalusia. He hears talk of war in Abyssinia. He arrives at Tarifa, making another stop over in Algeciras. He decides to stick to his plan to follow the coast round Spain, and sets off for M√°laga, stopping in Gibraltar. During his last days in Malaga his violin breaks. After his new line of work, acting as a guide to British tourists, is curtailed by local guides, he meets a young German who gives him a violin. In the winter of 1935 Lee decides to stay in Almu√±√©car. He manages to get work in a hotel. Lee and his friend Manolo, the hotel's waiter, drink in the local bar alongside the other villagers. Manolo is the leader of a group of fishermen and labourers, and they discuss the expected revolution. In February 1936 the Socialists win the election and the Popular Front begins. In the spring the villagers burn down the church, but then change their minds. In the middle of May there is a strike and the peasants come in from the countryside to lend their support, as the village splits between Fascists and Communists. In the middle of July 1936 war breaks out. Manolo helps to organise a militia. Granada is held by the rebels, and so is Almu√±√©car's neighbour Altofaro. A British destroyer from Gibraltar arrives to pick up any British subjects who might be marooned on the coast and Lee is taken on board. The epilogue describes Lee's return to his family home in Gloucestershire and his desire to help his comrades in Spain. He finally manages to make his way through France and crosses the Pyrenees into Spain in December 1937. Title  The title of the book is the first line of the Gloucestershire folk song \\"The Banks of Sweet Primroses\\".'The Banks of Sweet Primroses' lyrics on Folkinfo.org Critical responses Robert McFarlaneRobert McFarlane, book review, The Guardian, 20/6/2014 compares Lee's travels with those of his contemporary, Patrick Leigh Fermor. Both walked across parts of Europe that were in political turmoil between the world wars. McFarlane praises Lee's use of metaphor and argues that the \\"rose-tinted\\" descriptions in Cider with Rosie are replaced by \\"very dark passages\\". Sex with several partners is described \\"euphemistically\\". Life on the road is another key theme. As I Walked Out is about movement, where Cider with Rosie is about staying in one place.

By 1475, the West Riding of Yorkshire including Calderdale was also a major producer, while Devon and Somerset were major producers and exporters until the manufacture later moved to serge making.

Wright is best known as the author of the 2006 nonfiction book The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11. Wright is also known for his work with documentarian Alex Gibney who directed film versions of Wright's one man show My Trip to Al- Qaeda and his book Going Clear. His 2020 novel, The End of October, a thriller about a pandemic, was released in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background and education Wright graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Texas, in 1965 and was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 2009. He is a graduate of Tulane University and taught English at the American University in Cairo (from which he was awarded a Master of Arts in Applied Linguistics in 1969) in Egypt for two years. Wright lives in Austin, Texas. Career In 1980, Wright began working for the magazine Texas Monthly and contributed to Rolling Stone magazine. In late 1992, he joined the staff of The New Yorker. The Looming Tower Wright is the author of six books but is best known for his 2006 publication, The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11. A quick bestseller, The Looming Tower was awarded the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize, the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, and is frequently referred to by some media pundits as being an excellent source of background information on Al Qaeda and the September 11 attacks. The book's title is a phrase from the : \\"Wherever you are, death will find you, even in the looming tower\\", which Osama bin Laden quoted three times in a videotaped speech seen as directed to the 9/11 hijackers. Going Clear Wright had written a profile of former Scientologist Paul Haggis for The New Yorker. Wright's book on Scientology, Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief, published in January 2013, contains interviews from current and former Scientologists, and examines the history and leadership of the organisation. In an interview for The New York Times, Wright disclosed that he has received \\"innumerable\\" letters threatening legal action from lawyers representing the church and celebrities who belong to it. Wright spoke to 200 current and former Scientologists for the book. Additionally, the Church published an official statement in its newsroom and a blog listing its rebuttals to Wright's claims. Other projects Among Wright's other books are Remembering Satan: A Tragic Case of Recovered Memory (1994), about the Paul Ingram false memory case. On June 7, 1996, Wright testified at Ingram's pardon hearing. Wright co-wrote the screenplay for the film The Siege (1998), which tells the story of a terrorist attack in New York City that leads to curtailed civil liberties and rounding up of Arab-Americans. A script that Wright originally wrote for Oliver Stone was turned instead into a well- regarded Showtime movie, Noriega: God's Favorite (2000). A documentary featuring Wright, My Trip to Al-Qaeda, premiered on HBO in September 2010. It was based on his journeys and experiences in the Middle East during his research for The Looming Tower. My Trip to Al-Qaeda looks at al-Qaeda, Islamist extremism, anti-American sentiment and the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq and combines Wright's first-person narrative with documentary footage and photographs. Wright plays the keyboard in the Austin, Texas, blues collective WhoDo. Wright is also a playwright. He has worked on a script over several years concerning the making of the epic film Cleopatra that starred Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and Rex Harrison. The play is titled Cleo and was to have opened September 2017 in Houston, Texas, but was delayed by catastrophic flooding caused by hurricane Harvey. It eventually opened in April 2018.

It has been merged with Monsignor Bonner High School and renamed. It is located in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. The school is often referred to by its nickname, \\"Prendie\\". The school operates in a landmark building that formerly served as St. Vincent Orphanage. The school mascot is a panda bear. In September 2005, Bugh the Office of Catholic Education of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia announced that Archbishop Prendergast High School and the neighboring school for boys, Monsignor Bonner, would begin operating under one administration beginning in July 2006. Bonner's president, Rev. Augustine M. Esposito, O.S.A., Ph.D., was appointed President of the new co-institutional Monsignor Bonner-Archbishop Prendergast. The Principal of Archbishop Prendergast High School, Mary Haley Berner, herself an alumna of Prendergast, was named the first Principal of the co-institutional school in January 2006. Campus History The tract of land upon which Monsignor Bonner and Archbishop Prendergast Catholic High Schools were built was originally owned by Christopher Fallon, who constructed an impressive octagonal mansion on the site in 1850. The house was named \\"Runnymede\\" after the Fallon family seat in Roscommon County in Ireland. In 1882, the unusual building was purchased by Colonel Anthony J. Drexel. The mansion stood on what was at that time called the hill of Drexel, and consequently the surrounding area became known as Drexel Hill. In 1908, the mansion burned to the ground with only the gatehouse, which had served as servants' quarters, remaining. Archbishop Prendergast circa 1911 In 1917, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia purchased the for $57,000 and the Ordinary, Archbishop Edmond Francis Prendergast, announced the construction of an orphanage for five hundred orphans to be operated by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The orphanage replaced one demolished to allow the construction of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. It was named St. Vincent's Orphanage. Paul Monaghan was employed as architect and commissioned to build \\"one of the finest buildings in the diocese.\\" Work on the project was slowed by the war, and Archbishop Prendergast died before the work was completed. On May 9, 1920, the dedication took place. 40,000 people, accompanied by bands and musicians, walked from 69th Street to the dedication. Another 20,000 walked from the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in Lansdowne, and 65,000 more arrived by motorcar or by trolley from 69th Street. Archbishop Dennis Dougherty and Governor Sproul spoke to the 125,000 well-wishers gathered on the front lawn and along Garrett Road. St. Vincent's functioned as an orphanage for over 30 years. By 1952, the number of children needing care had dwindled, and the Most Reverend John F. O'Hara decided to move the remaining orphans to a smaller building in Saint David's and convert the facility into Archbishop Prendergast High School for Boys, to meet the increasing demand for a Catholic high school in the expanding western suburbs. Three years later, the Archdiocese constructed a new building on the same tract and named it Monsignor Bonner High School in memory of Reverend John J. Bonner, the former diocesan Superintendent of Schools. Bonner then became a school for boys and Prendergast was designated as a school for girls. In September 2005, the Office of Catholic Education of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia announced a restructuring under which both schools would operate under one administration, beginning on July 1, 2006. Bonner's president was appointed president of the new co-institutional Monsignor Bonner & Archbishop Prendergast Catholic High School. The Principal of neighboring Archbishop Prendergast High School, Mary Haley Berner, was named Principal of the co-institutional school in January 2006. On January 6, 2012, the Archdiocese announced that both Archbishop Prendergast High School and Monsignor Bonner High School would close in June 2012, along with three other Philadelphia Catholic High Schools and 44 Catholic elementary schools as part of the 2012 Archdiocese of Philadelphia school closings. On Friday, February 24, 2012, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia announced that Archbishop Prendergast High School and Monsignor Bonner High School were to remain open as a merged co-educational high school due to immense support from alumni and the surrounding community.

Biography Wynona Merceris Carr was born in Cleveland, Ohio, where she started out as a gospel singer, forming her own five-piece group The Carr Singers around 1945 and touring the Cleveland/Detroit area. Being tipped by the Pilgrim Travelers, who shared a bill with Carr in the late 1940s, Art Rupe signed her to his Specialty label, giving Carr her new stage name \\"Sister\\" Wynona Carr (modelled after pioneering gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe) and cutting some twenty sides with her from 1949 to 1954, including a couple of duets with Specialty's biggest gospel star at the time, Brother Joe May. Not having too much success on the charts (except for \\"The Ball Game\\" [1952], which became one of Specialty's best selling gospel records and most recently featured in the movie 42), Carr grew increasingly unhappy with the straight gospel direction of her career and pleaded with Rupe to let her record \\"pops, jumps, ballads, and semi-blues\\". Rupe relented and from 1955 to 1959 Carr recorded two dozen rock & roll and R&B; sides for Specialty, which, like her gospel songs, she mostly wrote herself. Despite scoring an R&B; hit with \\"Should I Ever Love Again?\\" in 1957, overall the change from spiritual to secular music didn't help Carr much in terms of sales or recognition. Unfortunately she also contracted tuberculosis around this time, which kept her from doing the necessary promotional work and touring for two years, effectively ending her tenure with Specialty in the summer of 1959. In 1961 Carr signed with Frank Sinatra's Reprise Records and released an unsuccessful pop album. She moved back to Cleveland, sinking into obscurity and suffering from declining health and depression; she died there in 1976. Style and appreciation Carr's contralto vocals have a sensual, husky quality quite unusual (or even inappropriate) for gospel singers in her day, which made her eventual switch to R&B; and rock & roll seem a logical choice in retrospect. The same goes for her idiosyncratic use of metaphors and themes in her gospel songs: baseball (\\"The Ball Game\\"), boxing (\\"15 Rounds For Jesus\\") and a popular TV show (\\"Dragnet For Jesus\\"). This penchant for novelty-like songs also shows in Carr's later R&B; repertoire, for instance \\"Ding Dong Daddy\\", \\"Nursery Rhyme Rock\\" and \\"Boppity Bop (Boogity Boog)\\". Carr's gospel recordings are very much influenced by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, incorporating blues and jazz stylings and already touching on R&B; with her take on Roy Brown's / Wynonie Harris' \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\", entitled \\"I Heard The News (Jesus Is Coming Again)\\". Her early R&B; material (for which she is probably best remembered now) was often uptempo, rock & roll-styled and similar in sound to fellow R&B;/rock & roll artists on the Specialty roster like Little Richard, Lloyd Price and Larry Williams, with a strong New Orleans-style backbeat and a rich, warm production. Her final Specialty sessions, conducted by Sonny Bono in 1959, cut down on the rock & roll influences. Both Carr's gospel and R&B; recordings went largely unappreciated during the time they were released, but found a new audience when Specialty Records released two CDs, covering Carr's entire output on the label and adding previously unreleased material, such as a recording with Rev. C.L. Franklin (father of Aretha Franklin) and his New Bethel Baptist Church Choir in Detroit. \\"The Ball Game\\" got a renewed hearing on the Prairie Home Companion show when Garrison Keillor and the Hopeful Gospel Quartet played it several times in the 2000's.

The Island remained basically natural with no cars or vehicles other than a golf cart at the club on the few southern hundred yards of the c. 7 mile long island where the rustic but charming club and its guest cottages were located. The island guest strollers would carefully scan the tidal harvest for the daily incoming batch of sea shells, one of the best beaches in Florida for finding many unusual specimens. From mid island, beach walkers could see Marco Island in the distance, highly glitzy and very developed since the 1960s, the opposite of the old pre World War II Florida on untouched and in no way commercialized or developed Keewaydin Island.

Opened in 1959, Roebling Road is relatively unique amongst racetracks in that it lacks any accommodations for spectators; there are no grandstands, no picnicking areas, nor any other sort of viewing facilities. The track was designed by John Rueter and held its first Sports Car Club of America event June 11‚Äì12, 1960. The track was financed by and named after SCCA supporter Robert Roebling, great-grandson of John A. Roebling.Atlas F1 Bulletin Board Roebling Road hosts events more than 300 days a year. Events range from media, pro teams testing cars, club racing, and performance driving education events. Club races include the SCCA, the BMW Car Owners Club of America, the Porsche Club of America, the North American Sports Car Association, and the Vintage Drivers Club of America. The track is used by cars, motorcycles andWKA karts. The PBS television series MotorWeek records its winter track-testing segments at Roebling Road. The track is a very safe and forgiving track, making it ideal to learn on. It is characterized by large amounts of run-off room and only a single wall. Roebling is unusual in that it is owned by a local racing club, the Buccaneer Region of the SCCA. Roebling is a not-for-profit, non- spectator oriented track. Roebling hosts several driver's education oriented events each month. The format varies with the hosting organization. There are relatively expensive events where the organizers provide high performance cars and, there are significantly less expensive events where drivers bring their own cars.

They are almost exclusively gentlemen, typically between the ages of 40 and 70, who excel in social ballroom dancing.https://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=2774https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/17/gentlemen- hosts_n_1260534.htmlhttps://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124042&page;=1http://www.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/worklife/10/22/cruise.hosts/index.html Many cruise lines allocate cabins for dance host programs. Dance hosts are expected to socialize with passengers and dance with the female passengers, who happen to greatly outnumber male passengers on most cruises. Dance hosts must be present nightly at dance floor locations and \\"work the room\\", offering a dance to each unescorted female passenger, while being careful to not to show favoritism. They are also responsible for attending all ship-sponsored parties and are often asked to host tables at dinner time. They serve as general companions, making conversation and joining in for shipboard activities and games. All the while, romance is not involved, so these gentlemen must have their wits and tact about them. Crossing another passenger's cabin threshold can result in disembarkation. The film Out to Sea, a comical interpretation of the position, is basically a guide of what not to do.https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-cruise-news-hosts-20170423-story.html Ideal applicants come from well traveled and well educated backgrounds who find it easy to converse on a variety of subjects. It is important that hosts have polished appearances and refined, approachable manners. They must also be in good shape, as dancing, most nights, lasts for hours. Cruise lines usually allocate one passenger cabin for two hosts and allow a placement agency to charge a small daily fee. This covers the cost of recruiting, qualifying, and booking hosts for the cruise lines' itineraries. Qualification procedures include a background check, a dance audition with a local dance instructor or video audition, and a written biography with a photograph which can be used as an introduction and conversation starter once on board. A host must have an inherent love for dancing and socializing and not consider his responsibilities a job, because he'd be disappointed to learn that dance hosting is not a paid position. On the other hand, he will be sailing to exciting destinations on a luxury vessel for a small fraction of the ticket price that the regular guests pay. There are often perks associated with this position including paid airfare for some long sailings, discounts for laundry, bar tabs, and internet, and opportunities to serve as an escorts for shore excursions - which means they may join in on $150+ land-based itineraries for free.https://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/11/cruise_ship_job_its_main_purpo.html References Category:Ballroom dance ","title":"Cruise ship dance host"},{"id":"7061575","text":"Jon Udell Jon Udell is a freelance journalist.jonudell.net From 2007 to 2014 he was \\"Evangelist\\" at Microsoft.

History Ken Rawlings, the founder of Otis Spunkmeyer, Inc., opened the first fresh-baked cookie store in Oakland, California in 1977. For the name of the business, Rawlings took the suggestion of his 12-year-old daughter who coined the name. By 1983, with his brother Bill, Rawlings had grown the company to less than two dozen stores. With high overhead costs and weak sales, the company shifted its focus from retail to wholesale, creating a store-baked cookie program for other foodservice operators. The program included pre-portioned frozen cookie dough, a pre-set convection oven, and marketing materials. This program allowed both big and small foodservice operators to sell store-baked cookies in their facilities. Otis Spunkmeyer hired a pair of DC-3 aircraft painted with the company logo and had them fly over the Golden Gate bridge. A 2002 management buyout was led by chief executive officer, John Schiavo, in association with the private equity firm of Code Hennessy & Simmons.

Plot Stephen Torcelli lives with his partner Danny Russo in New York City. When Stephen's parents call to announce a surprise visit for his father's birthday, Stephen and Danny scramble to conceal their double lives. The Torcellis already know that Stephen and Danny are gay; they don't know that they're enforcers for the Patrizzi crime family. Stephen's father is an undercover FBI agent and if he learns of their criminal affiliation he'll be obligated to report them. Stephen and Danny have told them that they run a catering company, even though neither of them can cook. Meanwhile, Don Patrizzi's daughter Jenny has announced her engagement. Even though her fianc√© is not Sicilian, Don Patrizzi decides to throw her a lavish engagement party which gets combined with the birthday party for Mr Torcelli. Mrs Torcelli suggests that the boys cater the party, sending them into a panic. One of Don Patrizzi's sons is an excellent chef - and the other is a master decorator - so the Patrizzi boys take care of the food and the decor. As a special treat for Jenny, Don Patrizzi forcibly \\"invites\\" a U.S. Senator under his control to the party. It is this guest who is of the most interest to the Jenningses, the parents of Jenny's fianc√©. They run a militia group which has declared war on the United States government and they want to take the opportunity to hold the Senator, a representative of that government, hostage. Oblivious to this threat, Don Patrizzi's soldiers have been enlisted to serve as waiters for the party. Reasoning that a catering company owned by a gay couple would have gay employees, they recruit a flamboyant friend of the Danny and Stephen's to give them a crash course on gay (including such vital information as the correct order of Elizabeth Taylor's husbands and the proper use of the expression \\"puh-lease!\\"). At the party all is going well until the Jenningses and their militiamen strike. They take the guests hostage and force the Senator to record a message for the media. Stephen and Danny, fearful that the tape will lead to police action and a deadly shootout, neutralize the militia with the help of the newly gay-acting Patrizzi soldiers and some random drag queens that were brought to the party for a vaguely defined purpose. With their cover blown, Stephen and Danny tell Mr Torcelli that they're ready for him to turn them in. However, the birthday he's celebrating is his 60th, meaning that he's been mandatorily retired and is no longer with the FBI. In other happy news for Don Patrizzi, Jenny's fianc√© turns out to be adopted and he was actually born Sicilian after all.

He was known to stage audiences for his witty improvisations and creative word games. He had a successful career as a character actor in films, appearing in over 50 films in his 25-year film career. He is probably best known to film audiences from the musical Singin' in the Rain, in which he appears as the man demonstrating a talking picture early in the film. Early years After the deaths of his parents, Tannen was placed in an orphanage in Indianapolis, Indiana, when he was seven years old, and he lived there until he was 13. He worked as a private secretary until he was 21. Career Tannen never intended to become a performer. As a young man, he was a salesman whose pitch was so good that he began to get offers to entertain at parties. He made his professional vaudeville debut at the age of 21, and soon developed into a monologist, the predecessor to today's stand up comic. He would frequently end his routines before the payoff of the story, allowing the audience to complete it for themselves, and exited with the phrase \\"My father thanks you, my mother thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you,\\" which was co-opted by the young George M. Cohan.Eder, Bruce Biography (Allmovie) Tannen made his Broadway debut in 1905, in a musical comedy called Lifting the Lid and went on to appear in three other productions in the next year. As a vaudevillian, he played the Palace Theatre in New York City - the apex of vaudeville performing - more often that almost any one else, indicating that he was at the peak of his profession. He appeared again on Broadway in 1916, and returned again in 1920, in a comic play with music, Her Family Tree, for which he received credit for writing his own scenes. Tannen was also seen in two editions of Earl Carroll's Vanities, in 1925 and 1926, and in George White's Scandals. In 1926, he became manager of Vanities in addition to his comedic performances. The advent of talking pictures created a need in Hollywood for performers with stage experience, and Tannen appeared in his first film in 1935, when he did an uncredited bit in Stranded. This set him upon his 25-year career as a character man, although his work frequently went without credit. In the 1940s, Tannen was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial \\"stock company\\" of character actors, appearing in eight films written and directed by Sturges, with the size of his roles increasing over time.Tannen appeared in Christmas in July, The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Hail the Conquering Hero, The Great Moment, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock and Unfaithfully Yours. Earlier, he had appeared in Remember the Night, which was written by Sturges. Undoubtedly, Tannen's most memorable and prominent performance came at the age of 72, when he portrayed a man demonstrating the technology of talking pictures in a film-within-the-film in Singin' in the Rain in 1952. Tannen continued to appear in films until 1959, when he was seen in an uncredited role in director John Sturges' Last Train from Gun Hill. He continued to work until he suffered a stroke in 1964.  Personal life and death  When Tannen was 19 years old, he married Beatrice Muhleman. The couple, who had two sons, Charles and William, were married for 60 years, until her death in 1960. Tanner died at the age of 84, on January 3, 1965, at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, California. Legacy Lucille Ball said that seeing Tannen perform in her hometown of Jamestown, New York when she was a child inspired her to go into show business. His sons, William Tannen and Charles Tannen, were both successful film and television actors; William had a recurring role on The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp; Charles later became a television executive.

Since the city/county merger in 2003, only five bills have ever been vetoed by the mayor (three by Jerry Abramson, two by Greg Fischer). In addition, only one veto has ever been overruled by the Council. The Metro Council is organized into 13 Standing Committees. Each Committee is led by a Chairman and Vice Chairman, both of whom are appointed by the Council President, who serves as an ex officio member of all committees. Public agencies In the city of Louisville, Public Agency is the name given to various regulatory agencies and public-benefit corporations which operate within the city limits. While in theory public agencies within the city fall under the absolute jurisdiction of the Louisville Mayor's office, in practice each agency possesses varying degrees of independence from the Louisville Mayor's Office and the Louisville Metro Council based on their function and level of financial independence. Each agency has been created by the Louisville Metropolitan government to provide the city and its inhabitants with a specific service or to fulfill some other function in the public interest. Louisville Free Public Library Established in 1905 upon the merger of multiple private library systems in the city of Louisville, the Louisville Free Public Library (LFPL) is a fully integrated agency of the Louisville Metropolitan government. Library assets and buildings are owned by the metro government and library employees are metro government employees. The largest public library system in the U.S. state of Kentucky with seventeen branches, the LFPL serves the entirety of Jefferson County. The library's main branch is sited at Fourth and York streets, south of Broadway in Downtown Louisville. The LFPL is overseen by a Director, who is appointed by the mayor of the Louisville Metro. Louisville Regional Airport Authority Founded in 1928, the Louisville Regional Airport Authority (LRAA) is an autonomous municipal corporation established by Chapter 77 of the 1928 Public Acts for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Under the provisions of Kentucky Revised Statutes Chapter 183, the LRAA is responsible for the establishment, ownership, operation, development, and promotion of airport and air navigation facilities within the Louisville Metropolitan Area. The Authority currently operates Louisville International Airport (SDF), primarily a commercial operations airport, and Bowman Field (LOU), primarily a general aviation and air traffic reliever to SDF. The Authority is overseen by an eleven-member Board of Directors which is responsible for the creation and enforcement of the policy and budget of the Authority and the airports under its jurisdiction. Additionally, the Board is tasked with the hiring of the Executive Director, who serves as the organization's chief executive officer and is tasked with governing the Authority. The Board is composed of the incumbent Mayor of Louisville, seven mayoral appointees, and three members appointed by the incumbent Governor of Kentucky. The Board members serve four- year staggered terms without compensation. Transit Authority of River City (TARC) The Transit Authority of River City (which markets itself under the name TARC) operates as a legal \\"Transit Authority\\" under KRS 96A.010 - .230. Founded in 1971 after the passage of state legislation in 1970 authorizing city and county governments in Kentucky to operate mass-transit systems using local funding, the Transit Authority of River City (henceforth abbreviated as \\"Louisville TARC\\" or \\"TARC\\") was created to absorb and replace the multiple private transit companies which existed in the city at the time. In 1974, one year after the passage of a controversial referendum pushed by then-mayor Harvey Sloane which raised the occupational privilege tax by 0.2%, TARC acquired the Louisville Transit Company and the Louisville Railway Company, which at the time were suffering severe financial difficulties and had planned to cease operations. Shortly after the acquisition, TARC began operating bussing services throughout the city. Over the last few decades since its inception, TARC has bought nearly all private transportation companies which operated within the Louisville city limits such as Blue Motor Coach lines and the Daisy Line. Louisville TARC is administered by an eight-member Board of Directors overseen by a Chairman. The board is responsible for managing, controlling and conducting the business, activities and affairs of the Transit Authority. The TARC Board of Directors is also responsible for overall planning of the mass public transit in its service area. Each member of the board is appointed by the incumbent mayor and approved by the Louisville Metro Council for three-year terms. Under normal circumstances, terms are staggered so no more than two seats become vacant within a six-month time frame. There is no term limit for board members. Heraldry The Seal of Louisville, Kentucky in its current form was adopted in 2003 upon the merger with Jefferson County, Kentucky. The seal reads LOUISVILLE - JEFFERSON COUNTY in a ring around a single fleur-de-lis with two stars. The seal includes the year 1778 (the year of Louisville's founding) on both sides. The seal was designed during a citywide competition by William Glenn Heck, an art director native to Louisville.

Life and career Early life Thomas was brought up in the strict tenets of the Presbyterian United Secession Church of Scotland. His father, Mungo Dick, was a small linen manufacturer, and he raised Thomas to work in this trade. When he was nine years old, he saw a brilliant meteor and this sparked a passion for astronomy. He read, sometimes even when seated at the loom, every book on the subject within his reach. He acquired an old pair of spectacles, contrived a machine for grinding the lenses to the proper shape, mounted them in pasteboard tubes, and began celestial observations. His parents, at first afflicted by his eccentricities, let him choose his own lifestyle when he was sixteen years old. Education Dick became assistant at a school in Dundee, and in 1794 entered the University of Edinburgh, supporting himself by private tuition. His philosophical and theological studies terminated, he set up a school at Dundee, took out a licence to preach in 1801, and officiated as probationer during some years at Stirling and elsewhere. After about fifteen months, he was excommunicated and lost his job there due to an affair with his servant.Astore, William J. \\"Dick, Thomas (1774‚Äì1857).\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, 2006. An invitation from the patrons to act as teacher in the Secession School at Methven resulted in a ten years' residence there, distinguished by efforts on his part towards popular improvement, including a zealous promotion of the study of science, the foundation of a people's library, and what was substantially a mechanic's institute. Under the name Literary and Philosophical Societies, adapted to the middling and lower ranks of the community, the extension of such establishments was recommended by him in five papers published in the Monthly Magazine in 1814; and, a year or two later, a society was organised near London on the principles there laid down, of which he was elected an honorary member. As an undergraduate, Dick had several noteworthy classmates at the University of Edinburgh including Robert Brown, Joseph Black and Robert Jameson. Writing career On leaving Methven, Dick spent another decade as a teacher in Perth. During this interval he made his first independent appearance as an author. The Christian Philosopher, or the Connexion of Science and Philosophy with Religion, was published first during 1823. Several new editions were published during the next few years, the eighth edition being published in Glasgow during 1842. Its success determined the author's vocation to literature. He finally gave up school teaching in 1827, and built himself a small cottage, fitted up with an observatory and library, on a hill overlooking the Tay at Broughty Ferry, near Dundee. Here he wrote a number of works, scientific, philosophical, and religious, which acquired prompt and wide popularity both in the United Kingdom and the United States, and which are available on the internet and in print.Complete Works of Thomas Dick, Parts 1 and 2. Kessinger Publishing, Whitefish, MT. (2003). Part 1: . Part 2: . Table of population of the planets in the Solar System, based on their surface area and the population density of England. Dick believed in the plurality of worlds or cosmic pluralism, that every planet in the Solar System was inhabited. In his book Celestial scenery, or, The Wonders of the planetary system displayed, among many other topics he computed that the Solar System contained 21,894,974,404,480 (21+ trillion) inhabitants. This was done using the surface area of each planet and the population density of England.Thomas Dick, Celestial Scenery, 1838, p305. He worked with the Religious Tract Society to published three of his books on science and religion, including one of his most successful books, The Telescope and Microscope. An honorary degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him early in his literary career by Union College, New York, and he was admitted to the Royal Astronomical Society on 14 January 1853. A paper on Celestial Day Observations, giving the results of a series of observations on stars and planets in the daytime with a small equatorial at Methven in 1812‚Äì1813, was communicated by him in 1855 to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (xv. 222). He had written on the same subject forty-two years previously in William Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy (xxxvi. 109). Later life Despite the success of his books, however, Dick made such loose bargains with his publishers, that he derived little profits from them, and his poverty was relieved in 1847 by a pension of 50 pounds a year, and by a local subscription of 20 or 30 pounds. He died at the age of eighty-two, on 29 July 1857, and was buried at Broughty Ferry. Influence and legacy Thomas Dick's books enabled the advances made by the Scottish Enlightenment in the previous century to flourish alongside Victorian moral and religious thinking. They influenced many scientists, engineers, politicians, writers and thinkers. For instance David Livingstone, who inspired health care, education and the end of slavery in central Africa, regarded Dick's Philosophy of a Future State as his most important influence after the Bible.Blaikie, William Garden (1880): The Personal Life of David Livingstone. Project Gutenberg Ebook #13262, release date: 23 August 2004. In 1851, Mr. Thomas met William Wells Brown, who later would describe Dick as \\"an abolitionist... who is willing that the world should know that he hates the \\"peculiar institution\\" [of slavery]\\".

Personal life and career Timothy Charles \\"Youngblood\\" Chapman, a third generation bondsman, is the son of Ronald Chapman and a Colorado bondswoman, Diane Wimberly, whose slogan was, \\"Let A Blond Write Your Bond\\". According to Tim, he grew up in Ventura, California. His parents separated when he was 2 1/2 years old and Tim and his brother, Russell J. Chapman, went to live with their paternal grandparents for two years. Tim spent his teenage years living with his mother and with his maternal grandparents, who owned and operated ABC Bail Bonds in Denver. Tim claims to have made his first civilian arrest at the age of 14 years. During his time working at his mother's bail bond business, Chapman met Duane \\"Dog\\" Chapman. Although the two share no blood relation, Dog refers to Tim as his \\"blood-brother\\". Later, Tim joined Dog, Dog's long time girlfriend Beth Smith, and Dog's son Leland in Hawaii where they had started the Da Kine Bail Bonds company. Tim Chapman was a regular cast member for the first five seasons of Dog the Bounty Hunter. Chapman was absent from the show from season six to the April 14, 2010 season seven episode \\"Mister Mom\\". Chapman explained that he had taken a break so that he could take care of his four youngest children. He also was dealing with the fallout from his second arrest. Arrests First arrest On September 14, 2006, Tim Chapman was arrested along with Duane \\"Dog\\" Chapman and Leland Chapman by U.S. Marshals at the request of the Mexican government, and were to be extradited to Mexico to face charges of \\"deprivation of liberty\\". The charges stem from an incident where Chapman, Dog, and Leland were chasing fugitive and serial rapist Andrew Luster, the Max Factor Cosmetics heir. They captured Luster on June 18, 2003 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Shortly after the capture, the three were themselves arrested by Puerto Vallarta police officers; the three posted bail but never returned to Mexico for their court hearing on July 15, 2003. Chapman, Dog, and Leland were released from custody on bail; Chapman and Leland's bail was set at $100,000 each, while Dog's was set at $300,000. After their release, all three were fitted with electronic bracelets, and were ordered to surrender their passports, and not leave the state of Hawaii. They faced an extradition hearing to Mexico, under the terms of treaties between the United States and Mexico. On the August 4, 2007 episode of Larry King Live, it was announced that the charges filed against the three bounty hunters had been dropped by the Mexican government. If convicted, the three could have been sentenced to up to four years in prison. Second arrest In January 2008, prosecutors charged Tim Chapman with first-degree \\"terroristic threatening\\" following an incident at the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was also charged with indecent exposure. Police and prosecutors stated that security guards recognized Chapman from his role of the show Dog the Bounty Hunter when they responded to a report of a man fondling himself in a vehicle at a parking lot around 9 P.M. on January 3, 2008. After a short court case, Tim was declared not guilty on all accounts and released.

He has raced internationally for Italy. Club career Sanchez started his British racing career with Glasgow Tigers in 1999. He quickly impressed and spent a further two seasons with the Scottish club before moving to England where he rode for Cornish side, Trelawny Tigers. He was part of their side that won the Premier Trophy in 2002. After moving to Hull Vikings he was part of the side that won the league and cup double in his first season in 2004. When Hull folded after the 2005 season, his contract was bought by Sheffield Tigers and he rode for the Yorkshire outfit in 2006. In 2007 he joined the newly reformed Birmingham Brummies, who ride at the Perry Barr Greyhound racing track, on loan from Sheffield Tigers. However, he had to have his spleen removed after rupturing it in a track crash. It ended his season and for a time there was uncertainty over his ability to start the 2008 season.

The inquiry into his death found that Mousa's death was caused by \\"factors including lack of food and water, heat, exhaustion, fear, previous injuries and the hooding and stress positions used by British troops - and a final struggle with his guards\\". The inquiry heard that Mousa was hooded for almost 24 hours during his 36 hours of custody by the 1st Battalion of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment and that he suffered at least 93 injuries prior to his death. The report later details that Mousa was subject to several practices banned under both domestic law and the Geneva Conventions. Seven British soldiers were charged in connection with the case. Six were found not guilty. Corporal Donald Payne pleaded guilty to inhumane treatment of a prisoner and was jailed for a year and dismissed from the Army. A final 1,400-page report said a \\"large number\\" of soldiers assaulted Mousa and that many others, including officers, must have known about the abuse. The report called his death an \\"appalling episode of serious gratuitous violence\\". The inquiry condemned the Ministry of Defence for \\"corporate failure\\" and the regiment for a \\"lack of moral courage to report abuse\\". Death On 14 September 2003, Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist, was arrested along with six other men and taken to a British base. While in detention, Mousa and the other captives were hooded, severely beaten and assaulted by a number of British troops. Two days later, Mousa was found dead. A post-mortem examination found that Mousa suffered at least 93 injuries, including fractured ribs and a broken nose, which were in part the cause of his death. Investigation Seven members of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment were tried on charges relating to the ill treatment of detainees, including those of war crimes under the International Criminal Court Act 2001. On 19 September 2006, Corporal Donald Payne pleaded guilty to a charge of inhumane treatment to persons, making him the first member of the British armed forces to plead guilty to a war crime. He was subsequently jailed for one year and expelled from the army. The BBC reported that the six other soldiers were cleared of any wrongdoing, and the Independent reported that the charges had been dropped, and that the presiding judge, Mr Justice Stuart McKinnon, stated that \\"none of those soldiers has been charged with any offence, simply because there is no evidence against them as a result of a more or less obvious closing of ranks.\\" Court rulings based on this case #Colonel Jorge Mendonca ‚Äì cleared of negligently performing a duty #Sergeant Kelvin Stacey ‚Äì cleared of common assault #Lance Corporal Wayne Crowcroft ‚Äì cleared of inhumane treatment #Private Darren Fallon ‚Äì cleared of inhumane treatment #Corporal Donald Payne ‚Äì admitted inhumane treatment, cleared of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice #Warrant Officer Mark Davies ‚Äì cleared of negligently performing a duty #Major Michael Peebles ‚Äì cleared of negligently performing a duty Breach of human rights On 27 March 2008, British Defence Secretary Des Browne admitted to \\"substantial breaches\\" of the European Convention of Human Rights over the death of Baha Mousa.MoD admits human rights breaches over death of tortured Iraqi civilian, Belfast Telegraph, 28 March 2008 In July 2008 the Ministry of Defence agreed to pay ¬£2.83 million in compensation to the family of Baha Mousa and nine other men, following an admission of \\"substantive breaches\\" of articles 2 and 3 (right to life and prohibition of torture) of the European Convention on Human Rights by the British Army.

Lawyers for families of the victims suggested there was sufficient evidence for fresh prosecutions in the civilian courts. Other enquiries Derek Keilloh had treated Baha Mousa when he was a Medical Officer with the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. In December 2012 Keilloh was struck off the Medical Register, after the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found him guilty of dishonest conduct in subsequent enquiries into Baha Mousa's death.

Williams, professor of law at Warwick University and an adviser to the families' lawyers, published A Very British Killing: The Death of Baha Mousa, an account of the events and the subsequent inquiry.

He was \\"instrumental\\" in bringing the British High Victorian architecture to the United States, and was a founding member of the American Institute of Architects. Biography A drawing of a lamp by Jacob Wrey Mould. Born in Chislehurst, Kent in 1825, Mould attended King's College School in 1842. For two years, he studied the Alhambra in Spain under Owen Jones, the \\"master of polychromy,\\" with whom he later co-designed the \\"Turkish Chamber\\" of Buckingham Palace. Mould's subsequent designs were often influenced by his appreciation of the Moorish style of architecture. Mould designed decorations for The Great Exhibition in London in 1851. He moved to the United States in 1852, and worked on the Crystal Palace Exhibition in Manhattan. He was invited by Moses H. Grinnell in 1853 to design and build Unitarian Church of All Souls, and then was brought in on early plans for the great urban park in the heart of the city, Central Park. Working closely with creators Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, he designed many of the park's notable landmarks, including the \\"graceful\\" and \\"richly decorated\\" old Bandstand, Belvedere Castle,M. M. Graff (1982) The Men Who Made Central Park, Greenward Foundation a great number of bridges, and the carvings on the Bethesda Terrace. Though described as eccentric and ill- mannered, Mould was hired full-time as an assistant city architect in 1857, and from 1870 to 1871 was architect-in-chief for the Department of Public Works. In the 1860s, he had also built two notable country homes in Long Island on Hempstead Bay, both of which were lavish and ornate buildings for rich clients from New York. Mould also collaborated with Vaux on the design of the original Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and designed the fountain at City Hall Park (1871).Conservation Solutions Inc. In 1874, Mould went to Lima, Peru, with Henry Meiggs, where he helped design a public park. He returned to New York in 1879, and resumed his duties for the Department of Public Works until his death in New York City on 14 June 1886. He built the Morningside Park promenade in 1883, and his final design in the United States was a temporary tomb for President Ulysses S. Grant in Riverside Park, replaced later by the permanent monument known as Grant's Tomb.Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. 4, pg 445, Digitized by Google Besides being an accomplished architect and designer, Jacob Wrey Mould was an avid pianist and organist, and employed his talent for language in translating numerous foreign opera librettos into English.James Stevens Curl (2006) A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, Oxford University Press, Oxford Reference Online.

Soon after his appointment, he was opposed by the king-men, who wanted to dethrone the chief judge and replace him with a king. Supporting the chief judge and the current order were the \\"freemen\\". The people voted, and the freemen won (). The king-men were unwilling to defend their country against the attacks from Amalickiah, which angered Moroni. Moroni requested Pahoran to give him the right to conscript the king-men or to have them executed for treason. Pahoran approved the request (). Several years later, Moroni writes to Pahoran to request reinforcements but with no success. Moroni complained to Pahoran and questioned his loyalty to his country. Pahoran responded that the capital, Zarahemla, was controlled by the king-men and that he had been exiled. He assures Moroni that he is not a traitor but wants only to preserve the liberty of his people (,,). Moroni and Pahoran gathered an army against Pachus, the leader of the king-men. Pachus was slain, the king-men are executed, and Pahoran was restored to the judgement seat. Moroni and Pahoran work to drive the Lamanites from their land (). Finally, in around 53 BC, in the 39th year of the judgea, Pahoran dies, apparently while still the chief-judge (). Pahoran, son of Pahoran Pahoran was also the name of the previous Pahoran's son. When the aforementioned Pahoran had died, he left no one to fill in his place in the judgement-seat. Three of Pahoran's sons, by the names of Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni, were left to contend for it, but the matter was settled in the 40th year of the reign of the judges, or around 52 BC, by a vote: Pahoran, the son of Pahoran, won it. Pacumeni, when he saw that he lost, accepted the outcome and supported his brother, but Paanchi, the third brother, would not. He tried to rebel but was executed according to law. His followers were so angry at that that one of them, a man named Kishkumen, went to the judgement-seat and murdered Pahoran. He then escaped the clutches of Pahoran's servants and fled. Pahoran was succeeded by his brother, Pacumeni. King-men The king-men were a group of Nephites who sought to overthrow Judge Pahoran and install a king to rule the land. Some Nephites dissented from the current government and believed Chief-Judge Pahoran should change some laws, but Pahoran refused. The dissenters, called king-men, then wanted a king to be appointed to govern instead of a chief-judge. However a public vote overruled them,Book of Mormon Stories, (1997), Chapter 33: King-Men versus Freemen and the rest of the people called themselves \\"freemen to distinguish their position and their desire to retain their religious freedoms. Pahoran kept his position and there was no bloodshed. Meanwhile, Amalickiah gathered an army of Lamanites to attack the Nephites. The freemen prepared to battle, but the king-men refused to defend their country. Captain Moroni, the leader of the Nephite armies, was angry from the king-men's stubbornness and petitioned Pahoran for legal authority to compel the king-men to defend their country or be executed. By popular consent and the approval of Pahoran, Moroni and his armies quashed the king-men's rebellion, killing about 4000 men; the remainder of the king-men yielded to Moroni and took up arms in their country's defense.

Biography  Sugiyama was born in 1909 in Asakusa, the eldest son of the owner of a stationery shop. In 1928, Sugiyama enrolled in the Tokyo Art School (now the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music). He formed the \\"rossogasha\\" (Áë†ÁàΩÁîªÁ§æ) along with Yamamoto Kyujin and Takayama Tatsuo, and participated positively in the movement to reform nihonga. His paintings are characteristized by peacefulness filled with a sense of security, owing to excellent sketching ability and solid construction. In 1958, his eldest daughter married Yukio Mishima. As a reason for choosing her, Mishima suggested \\"because she was the daughter of an artist, so she wouldn't hold to many of the illusions people have about artists\\". He received a commission to design the carpets of Tokyo Imperial Palace. His stylized pattern of clouds (kumo) was used in the Shunju-no-Ma, a grand hall with an area of 608 square meters, or about 184 tsubo.
