Chawner was the daughter, sister, and wife of silversmiths; her father was the watchcase maker William Burwash, and her husband, whom she married in 1816, was the spoonmaker William Chawner II. The couple had a son, William, and a daughter, Mary Ann. The elder William died on 20 March 1834 and his widow registered her own mark on 14 April the same year; five new marks followed on 25 March 1835. Like her husband, Mary was a spoonmaker as well. She gave her address in London as 16 Hosier Lane. Mary was overseeing the firm until the younger William could take over; however, upon finishing his apprenticeship in 1838, he embarked instead on a religious career. Consequently the business was left to George Adams, Mary Ann's husband. He entered partnership with his mother-in-law on 3 August 1840; on 23 November that year he took full leadership of the firm. Several pieces bearing the hallmark of Mary Chawner are in the collection of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. These include six William IV tablespoons, from 1835; a William IV fish slice, of the same year; a Victorian fish slice, of 1839; and two Victorian dinner forks, also from that year.

His video Japan, Beyond (2012) won the first prize at the Stand for Japan Awards, while Jack Attack was selected by more than fifty international film festivals and won dozens of awards and other honors. He was born and raised in the Veneto region, near Venice, but has called New York's West Village home since 2007, and is the co-founder of the Greenwich Village Film Festival. Early life and education Antonio Padovan was born in 1987, in Conegliano, where he also grew up. From a very young age, Padovan had a love for the cinema. He was a teenager on September 11, 2001, which left a very deep impression on him, ultimately precipitating his move to New York City, though he was not conscious of the connection at the time. Padovan obtained a surveyor's diploma before attending a three-year course at the Italian School of Design in Padua. During the last months of the course he sent his portfolio to a number of studios in Italy and abroad, but responded only to Bam Design, an architectural firm in SoHo, New York, who offered him an internship, requiring him to leave immediately for New York. Padovan moved to New York without any real plan, driven only by a desire to live there, which years later he realized was connected to the impression made on him in his youth. Career Architect, film studies, and early short films (2007‚àí2011) In 2007, at the age of twenty, Padovan arrived in Manhattan, and the city of New York, which had once been a distant, ill-defined place now became real to him, and his home. The internship led to a paid employment contract: \\"Originally I wanted to try to work here for a couple of months, but my studio ended up hiring and sponsoring me.\\" Padovan mainly worked on interior design and restorations, in Diesel stores as well as their headquarters on West 19th Street, and Domenico Dolce's penthouse in Chelsea (acquired by the fashion designer in 2009 for $29 million). After a couple of years, finding himself working twelve-hour days and often weekends, \\"which is pretty normal for an architect,\\" Padovan realized the career was not for him: \\"I've always loved films, I own myself probably 2000 DVDs, but back in Italy I never thought I could have been part of it.\\" One night, after seeing a Woody Allen film at the cinema, he was inspired and the next morning enrolled in an eight-week course in film directing at the New York Film Academy instead of going to work. Despite this, the firm continued to give him projects, and he began to divide his time between architecture and wandering Manhattan with a camera on his shoulder; at the end of the program, after completing his first short film, he received a full scholarship to come back for another year. Padovan's first short film, which he wrote as well as directed, was Socks and Cakes, a slice of life film that impressed not only his professors, but also the judges at the 2010 Las Vegas film festival, where it won a Golden Ace Award. His next short film was his student thesis, Perry St., a romantic comedy about a therapist and patient who struggle with the issues within their separate love lives, starring Catherine Mary Stewart. Also released in 2010, it was accepted at sixteen film festivals and well received, winning four awards and an honorable mention. Not long after, he made another short film shot in Taiwan, Tomorrow. By July 2011, Padovan released his fourth film, Mia, \\"a romantic comedy\\" set in the West Village (a \\"favorite locale\\"), and which played at major film festivals, and was halfway through shooting his fifth film, Tillman, a project where for the first time he was his own cinematographer. He was now involved in several other projects simultaneously and in diverse capacities, here a production assistant (AmeriQua), there co- writing a horror short, writing a feature film, as well as a project based in China. His Christmas film, Puh-Rump-A-Pum-Pum was also released in 2011. It has been remarked that most of these early films focus \\"on common people and ordinary problems.\\" Video and commercial film director (2011‚àí2013) Along with his early artistic achievements, Padovan's professional directing career began in earnest with a company called JAJ, directing videos and commercials, his time divided between the US, Europe and Asia, working for companies from all around the world, including eStock Photo, Barilla and Hyundai. Some of his commercials ran during the 2012 FIFA World Cup. He was commissioned by Asatsu- DK, the largest communication company in Japan, to direct a video intended to restore Japan's international image in the wake of the Fukushima disaster; the result was Japan, Beyond (2012), for which Padovan won the Stand for Japan Award and was invited to Tokyo. In May 2012, it was reported that Padovan had co-written a feature film, Getting Closer, with producer and playwright Libby Edmonds about two women in their forties, and the love relationship that develops between one of the women and her friend's 18-year-old son, an exploration of \\"a sincere, love relationship of an older woman and a younger man,\\" and its effect upon the two best friends which interested Padovan because Hollywood routinely presents older men with younger female love interests and very rarely the other way round. As of 2019, this project has not been realised and appears to have been abandoned. Genre and documentary filmmaker (2013‚àí2016) In 2013, Padovan began to release films reflecting his exploration of other genres of filmmaking: he wrote and directed an hour- long documentary film, Once Upon a Time, Inc., about the eponymous non-profit performing arts center and theater in Richmond Hill, Queens, where Padovan taught a class in filmmaking once per week, and a breakthrough in the form of his first short horror movie, Jack Attack, which won more than thirty awards, and was selected by more than fifty festivals internationally, including Fantafestival, Milan, Sitges, Fantasia, Melbourne, Fantastic Fest, and the New York City Horror Film Festival. In Los Angeles, the film was shown at the Mann's Chinese Theatre, and has since been released as part of two anthology films in the U.S.: Seven Hells (2014), and All Hallows' Eve 2 (2015). Padovan's next short films, released from 2014 through 2016, were M is for Misdirection, selected as one of the twelve finalists for the ABCs of Death 2 competition, from 548 international entries, and a pair of short animated films produced in Italy: The Mods, which won the Giotto Special Prize at the Giffoni Film Festival, the largest children's film festival in the world, and The Little Sunflower that Fell in Love with the Moon, which he later adapted as a children's book published by Le Brumaie (2017) and launched at the in Turin, in 2017. Eveless (2016) is a science-fiction horror film about two men living in a world without women who attempt to create one with only the limited resources they have gathered. It was selected for inclusion in the 2017 Canadian science-fiction horror anthology film Galaxy of Horrors, which comprises eight short films within a larger narrative frame in which a man awakens from a cryogenic sleep pod and is forced to watch the shorts as entertainment while his damaged life-support runs out. Greenwich Village Film Festival During this period, in 2015, Padovan co-founded the Greenwich Village Film Festival, which selects short films and documentaries from around the world, with fellow filmmaker Alessia Gatti, with a view to celebrating the neighborhood where they both live, and where most of Padovan's films have been made (specifically, in the West Village). Alessia Gatti describes the origins and quick expansion of the event in 2016: > It started out as just an idea I had with a friend, Antonio Padovan, and > then luck had it our way when on the night of our first edition we met two > producers, Richard Eric Weigle and Michael Anastasio, both of which have > been residents of the village for forty-three years. They were enthused with > our idea and decided to join us for this year's event. Thanks to their > support we're now able to hold the event for three nights at our 2016 > edition. The festival has continued to grow, and in 2018, was held in the IFC Center. Feature film director (2017‚àí ) Debut feature In 2016, Padovan was reportedly in post-production for his first feature film, set to be released in the fall of 2017, a murder mystery comedy film taking place among the vineyards of Prosecco, in the hills outside Venice. Based on the 2010 novel Finch√© c'√® Prosecco c'√® Speranza by , it would promote the image of the Veneto region. In a 2018 interview, when asked why he returned to Italy to make his first feature, Padovan said that while on a ten-day vacation in Italy, his sister suggested he read a novel set in his (and the author's) native Veneto region; it impressed him for its story, but it was also out of nostalgia that he decided that his first feature film should be shot \\"in his own house\\" (l'avrei girato \\"a casa mia\\"), the Veneto region having been relatively unexplored by Italian cinema up to now. Padovan collaborated with Ervas to write the screenplay for The Last Prosecco, which stars Giuseppe Battiston. Second feature In the 2018 interview, Padovan said he was working on a second Italian feature based on an original idea co-written with Marco Pettenello, scheduled for release in 2019. A casting call was issued in the Polesine area by Padovan in March 2019. The title was revealed to be Il grande passo during the casting call in Rovigo. In April, a second casting call was made for the project, with filming to take place in Rosolina. Cast members included Giuseppe Battiston, , and Camilla Filippi, while crew included Gaspare De Pascali (screenplay) and Duccio Cimatti (cinematography). Additional filming locations included Canaro, Crespino, and Villanova Marchesana, with shooting beginning on 9 April and was to have concluded on 18 May, with Battiston and Fresi, who had never appeared on screen together before, playing two brothers, Mario and Dario. As it transpired, the plot involves igniting a rocket ship, but something went wrong on 1 May and the prop was completely destroyed, thereby postponing the shoot. Despite the delay, the film was released as scheduled, winning awards for the two leads at the 37th Turin Film Festival in late November 2019. Aesthetics and directing style Antonio Padovan does not like what he calls a \\"self-absorbed directorial style, where the use of albeit visually striking images\\" clouds the story, citing as examples Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, and films by Tim Burton and the Coen Brothers. In his opinion, Bridesmaids is a better film than Tree of Life and Toy Story 3 \\"a far better film and a worthier recipient of the Oscar for Best Picture\\" than The King's Speech. Padovan once described himself as \\"a very cynical filmmaker\\": \\"I like to work on projects that can happen soon and can be done soon. I can't write something that I intend to shoot in a year or two, because that idea scares me. I write knowing how to shoot and when, so that everything runs easier.\\" He engages in intense pre- production work and does not believe in over-directing actors: \\"Cast good actors and get out of their way,\\" unless the actor gets nervous as the shooting day approaches, \\"then it becomes necessary to feed them little lies just to bolster their self-confidence.\\" Filmography ;Short films and notable videos (2010‚àí2016) *Socks and Cakes (2010) *Perry St. (2010) *Tomorrow (2010?) *Mia (2011) *Tillman (2011) *Puh-Rump-A-Pum-Pum (2011) * Japan, Beyond (2012) * Once Upon a Time, Inc.

He made great efforts to better conditions for the hospital's lepers. He was also the father of the author and poet Johan Sebastian Welhaven. Ancestry Welhaven's grandfather, Christopher Welhaven or Welhaver (1725‚Äì1783), was a passementerie maker from Ribnitz near the Hanseatic city of Rostock in what is northeastern Germany today. His son, Johan Andreas Welhaven (1748‚Äì1811), came to Bergen at the age of 17 as an apprentice at Bryggen. After six years, he became a journeyman. In time, he became a teacher at the German school for the poor established in 1777 in connection with St. Mary's Church in Bergen. Later he also became an organist and sexton at that church. He married Elisabeth Margrethe Woltmann (died 1814), who was also from northeast Germany. Johan Andreas Welhaven appears to have been a hard-working man that, in addition to acquiring the Norwegian language, paid for higher education for his three sons, including Johan Ernst Welhaven. Life Welhaven was ordained a priest in 1801, and he spent his entire working life at St. George's Hospital Church, initially as the curate (1801‚Äì1807), and later as the parish priest (1808‚Äì1827). In 1806 he married Else Margrethe Cammermeyer (1785‚Äì1853). Welhaven's father-in-law, Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer (1730‚Äì1819), was a Danish curate at Holy Cross Church in Bergen. His mother-in-law, Maren n√©e Heiberg (1742‚Äì1812), was also of Danish descent and thereby the aunt of the Danish poet Peter Andreas Heiberg (the father of Johan Ludvig Heiberg). In 1827/28 Welhaven received a prestigious position at the Bergen Cathedral, but he died just before he was to begin his duties there. Descendants Many central figures in Norwegian culture and society are descendants of Johan Ernst Welhaven and Else Margrethe Cammermeyer. Among their eleven children are the three authors Johan Sebastian Welhaven (1807‚Äì1873), Elisabeth Welhaven (1815‚Äì1901), and Johan Ernst Welhaven Junior (1818‚Äì1883). Through their daughter Maren Welhaven (1811‚Äì1889), who married Michael Sars (1805‚Äì1869), they were the grandparents of the historian Ernst Sars (1835‚Äì1917), the singer Eva Nansen (1858‚Äì1907), and the zoologist Georg Ossian Sars (1837‚Äì1927).

(\\"The data show that the modern period is very different to what occurred in the past. The often quoted Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age are real phenomena, but small compared to the recent changes.\\") The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) also known as the Medieval Climate Optimum, or Medieval Climatic Anomaly was a time of warm climate in the North Atlantic region lasting from to . It was likely related to warming elsewhere while some other regions were colder, such as the tropical Pacific. Average global mean temperatures have been calculated to be similar to early-mid-20th- century warming. Possible causes of the Medieval Warm Period include increased solar activity, decreased volcanic activity, and changes to ocean circulation. The period was followed by a cooler period in the North Atlantic and elsewhere termed the Little Ice Age. Some refer to the event as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly as this term emphasizes that climatic effects other than temperature were important. It is thought that between and was the Northern Hemisphere's warmest period since the Roman Warm Period. It was only in the 20th and 21st centuries that the Northern Hemisphere experienced higher temperatures. Climate proxy records show peak warmth occurred at different times for different regions, indicating that the Medieval Warm Period was not a globally uniform event. Box 6.4 Initial research The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) is generally thought to have occurred from ‚Äì, during the European Middle Ages. In 1965 Hubert Lamb, one of the first paleoclimatologists, published research based on data from botany, historical document research and meteorology, combined with records indicating prevailing temperature and rainfall in England around and around . He proposed, \\"Evidence has been accumulating in many fields of investigation pointing to a notably warm climate in many parts of the world, that lasted a few centuries around ‚Äì AD, and was followed by a decline of temperature levels till between and the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred.\\" The warm period became known as the Medieval Warm Period, and the cold period was called the Little Ice Age (LIA). However, that view was questioned by other researchers; the IPCC First Assessment Report of 1990 discussed the \\"Medieval Warm Period around 1000 AD (which may not have been global) and the Little Ice Age which ended only in the middle to late nineteenth century.\\" It said temperatures in the \\"late tenth to early thirteenth centuries (about AD 950-1250) appear to have been exceptionally warm in western Europe, Iceland and Greenland\\".IPCC First Assessment Report Working Group 1 report, Chapter 7, Executive Summary p. 199, Climate Of The Past 5,000,000 Years p.202. The IPCC Third Assessment Report from 2001 summarized newer research: \\"evidence does not support globally synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this time frame, and the conventional terms of 'Little Ice Age' and 'Medieval Warm Period' appear to have limited utility in describing trends in hemispheric or global mean temperature changes in past centuries.\\" Global temperature records taken from ice cores, tree rings, and lake deposits, have shown that the Earth may have been slightly cooler globally (by 0.03 ¬∞C) than in the early and mid-20th century. Palaeoclimatologists developing region-specific climate reconstructions of past centuries conventionally label their coldest interval as \\"LIA\\" and their warmest interval as the \\"MWP.\\" Others follow the convention, and when a significant climate event is found in the \\"LIA\\" or \\"MWP\\" time frames, they associate their events to the period. Some \\"MWP\\" events are thus wet events or cold events rather than strictly warm events, particularly in central Antarctica, where climate patterns opposite to the North Atlantic area have been noticed. Evidence exists across the world, often very sparsely, for changes in climatic conditions over time. Some of the \\"warm period\\" events documented below are actually \\"dry periods\\" or \\"wet periods.\\" Globally A 2009 study by Michael E. Mann et al., examining spatial patterns of surface temperatures shown in multi-proxy reconstructions finds that the Medieval Warm Period, shows \\"warmth that matches or exceeds that of the past decade in some regions, but which falls well below recent levels globally.\\" Their reconstruction of the pattern is characterised by warmth over a large part of the North Atlantic Ocean, Southern Greenland, the Eurasian Arctic, and parts of North America which appears to substantially exceed that of the late 20th century (1961‚Äì1990) baseline and is comparable or exceeds that of the past decade or two in some regions. Certain regions, such as central Eurasia, northwestern North America, and (with less confidence) parts of the South Atlantic, exhibit anomalous coolness. Further analysis of the bulk compilation of all paleoclimatology studies that were done in various areas around the globe appear to indicate a global trend of warming, particularly in the northern and southern peaks but less towards the equator. More recently, a study by the Pages-2k consortium suggests the warming was not globally synchronous: \\"Our regional temperature reconstructions also show little evidence for globally synchronized multi-decadal shifts that would mark well- defined worldwide MWP and LIA intervals. Instead, the specific timing of peak warm and cold intervals varies regionally, with multi-decadal variability resulting in regionally specific temperature departures from an underlying global cooling trend.\\"https://www.blogs.uni- mainz.de/fb09climatology/files/2012/03/Pages_2013_NatureGeo.pdf In direct contrast to these findings, a 2013 study recreates a \\"temperature record of western equatorial Pacific subsurface and intermediate water masses over the past 10,000 years that shows that heat content varied in step with both northern and southern high-latitude oceans. The findings support the view that the Holocene Thermal Maximum, the Medieval Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age were global events, and they provide a long-term perspective for evaluating the role of ocean heat content in various warming scenarios for the future.\\" North Atlantic Greenland ice sheet temperatures interpreted with 18O isotope from 6 ice cores (Vinther, B., et al., 2009). The dataset ranges from 9690BC to AD1970 and it has a resolution of around 20 years, meaning that each data point represents the average temperature of the surrounding 20 years. Norse Greenlanders are from an Icelandic marriage in 1408 but recorded later in Iceland, at Hvalsey Church, now the best-preserved of the Norse ruins. Lloyd D. Keigwin's 1996 study of radiocarbon-dated box core data from marine sediments in the Sargasso Sea found that its sea surface temperature was approximately cooler approximately 400 years ago (the Little Ice Age) and 1700 years ago and approximately 1 ¬∞C warmer 1000 years ago (the Medieval Warm Period). Using sediment samples from Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, and the Atlantic Coast from Florida to New England, Mann et al. (2009) found consistent evidence of a peak in North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity during the Medieval Warm Period that was followed by a subsequent lull in activity. By retrieval and isotope analysis of marine cores and from examination of mollusc growth patterns from Iceland, Patterson et al were able to reconstruct a mollusc growth record at a decadal resolution from the Roman Warm Period to the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. North America 1690 copy of the 1570 Sk√°lholt map, based on documentary information about earlier Norse sites in America. The 2009 Mann et al. study found warmth exceeding 1961‚Äì1990 levels in Southern Greenland and parts of North America during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (defined in the study from 950 to 1250) with warmth in some regions exceeding temperatures of the 1990‚Äì2010 period. Much of the Northern Hemisphere showed significant cooling during the Little Ice Age (defined in the study from 1400 to 1700), but Labrador and isolated parts of the United States appeared to be approximately as warm as during the 1961‚Äì1990 period. Norse colonization of the Americas has been associated with warmer periods. The common theory is that Norsemen took advantage of ice-free seas to colonize areas in Greenland and other outlying lands of the far north. However a study from Columbia University suggests that Greenland was not colonized in warmer weather, but in fact the warming effect was very short term. , the climate was sufficiently warm for the Vikings to journey to Newfoundland and establish a short-lived outpost there. From around 985, Vikings founded the Eastern Settlement and Western Settlement, both near the southern tip of Greenland. In the colony's early stages, they kept cattle, sheep, and goats, with around a quarter of their diet from seafood. After the climate became colder and stormier around 1250, their diet steadily shifted towards ocean sources; by around 1300, seal hunting provided over three quarters of their food. By 1350, there was reduced demand for their exports, and trade with Europe fell away. The last document from the settlements dates from 1412, and over the following decades, the remaining Europeans left in what seems to have been a gradual withdrawal, caused mainly by economic factors such as increased availability of farms in Scandinavian countries. L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, today, with a reconstruction of a Viking settlement. In Chesapeake Bay (now Maryland and Virginia in the United States), researchers found large temperature excursions (changes from the mean temperature of that time) during the Medieval Warm Period (about 950‚Äì1250) and the Little Ice Age (about 1400‚Äì1700, with cold periods persisting into the early 20th century), possibly related to changes in the strength of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Sediments in Piermont Marsh of the lower Hudson Valley show a dry Medieval Warm period from 800 to 1300. Prolonged droughts affected many parts of the western United States and especially eastern California and the west of Great Basin. Alaska experienced three time intervals of comparable warmth: 1‚Äì300, 850‚Äì1200, and post-1800. Knowledge of the North American Medieval Warm Period has been useful in dating occupancy periods of certain Native American habitation sites, especially in arid parts of the western United States.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Los Osos Back Bay, Megalithic Portal, editor A. Burnham. MWP droughts may have also impacted Native American settlements in the eastern United States, such as at Cahokia. Review of more recent archaeological research shows that as the search for signs of unusual cultural changes has broadened, some of the early patterns (for example, violence and health problems) having been found to be more complicated and regionally varied than it had been previously thought. Others, like settlement disruption, deterioration of long distance trade, and population movements, have been further corroborated. Africa The climate in equatorial eastern Africa has alternated, being between drier than today and relatively wet. The drier climate took place during the Medieval Warm Period (1000‚Äì1270). Antarctica A sediment core from the eastern Bransfield Basin, Antarctic Peninsula, preserves climatic events from the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period. The authors noted, \\"The late Holocene records clearly identify Neoglacial events of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and Medieval Warm Period (MWP).\\" Pacific Ocean Corals in the tropical Pacific Ocean suggest that relatively cool, dry conditions may have persisted early in the millennium, consistent with a La Ni√±a-like configuration of the El Ni√±o- Southern Oscillation patterns. South America The Medieval Warm Period has been noted in Chile in a 1500-year lake bed sediment core as well as in the Eastern Cordillera of Ecuador. A reconstruction based on ice cores found the Medieval Warm Period could be distinguished in tropical South America from about 1050 to 1300 that was followed, in the 15th century, by the Little Ice Age. Peak temperatures did not rise as high as those from the late 20th century, which were unprecedented in the area during the study period of 1600 years. Asia Adhikari and Kumon (2001), investigating sediments in Lake Nakatsuna in central Japan, found a warm period from 900 to 1200 that corresponded to the Medieval Warm Period and three cool phases, two of which could be related to the Little Ice Age. Another research in northeastern Japan shows that there is one warm and humid interval, from 750 to 1200, and two cold and dry intervals, from 1 to 750 and from 1200 to now. Ge et al. studied temperatures in China during the past 2000 years and found high uncertainty prior to the 16th century but good consistency over the last 500 years highlighted by the two cold periods, 1620s‚Äì1710s and 1800s‚Äì1860s, and the warming during the 20th century. They also found that the warming during the 10‚Äì14th centuries in some regions might be comparable in magnitude to the warming of the last few decades of the 20th century, which was unprecedented within the past 500 years. Oceania There is an extreme scarcity of data from Australia for both the periods of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. However, evidence from wave-built shingle terraces for a permanently- full Lake Eyre during the 9th and 10th centuries is consistent with a La Ni√±a- like configuration, but the data is insufficient to show how lake levels varied from year to year or what climatic conditions elsewhere in Australia were like. A 1979 study from the University of Waikato found,\\"Temperatures derived from an 18O/16O profile through a stalagmite found in a New Zealand cave (40.67¬∞S, 172.43¬∞E) suggested the Medieval Warm Period to have occurred between AD and and to have been 0.75 ¬∞C warmer than the Current Warm Period.\\" More evidence in New Zealand is from an 1100-year tree-ring record.

She was the superintendent of the German work for the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (NWCTU), and president of the State Union of Idaho, In that capacity, she traveled all over the United States, lecturing in English and German, and leaving behind her local unions of well-organized women. Skelton's name was known by thousands of German citizens of the United States as one of the most dedicated workers in the temperance movement. For a time, she edited the temperance paper known as Der Bahnbrecher, besides writing several books published in the English language, including The Man-Trap (Toronto), a temperance story; Clara Burton (Cincinnati), a story for girls; and The Christmas Tree (Cincinnati), a description of domestic life in Germany. Early years Henrietta (sometimes spelled Henneriette) Hedderich was born in Giessen, Germany, November 5, 1839. Her father was a professor in the University of Giessen. Her first four years were spent playing with two sisters and three brothers. When she was five, two brothers and a sister died within a brief period. About the same time, Professor Hedderich was elected to one of the principal professorships in the University of Heidelberg There, in a Froebel kindergarten, Skelton began her studies. When Skelton turned sixteen, her father died, and her mother did so, too, six months later. An uncle received Skelton as a legacy from the dying mother, and, after settling up the family affairs, removed his charge and her brother to his home in Canada. Career At the age of eighteen, she married an Englishman, Mr. Skelton, who was a traffic superintendent of the Northern Railway. The marriage was a happy one. After thirteen years of marriage, on the husband's death-bed, Skelton dedicated herself to the temperance movement, a cause that had been important to the couple. He died in their home in Toronto, Canada, in 1874. At his death, the widow had nothing left but their son. Soon after, the son, showing signs of pulmonary disease, accompanied his mother to southern California, hoping to find health. Shortly after, Skelton entered the lecture field, where she promptly earned the reputation of being a persuasive orator. So soon as the Prohibition party was proposed, Skelton became involved in the movement. Skelton devoted herself to the cause of the WCTU, with which for years, during her residence in Canada, she had been closely identified. Her dedication to reform was recognized early on by the national executive board of the WCTU, and she was appointed one of its national organizers. In that capacity, she traveled all over the United States, lecturing in both English and German, and leaving behind her local unions of well-organized women. German citizens of the United States knew her as one of the most dedicated workers in the cause of temperance. For a time, she conducted the temperance paper known as Der Bahnbrecher (The Pioneer), Skelton's most popular books were Eastertide, A Man Trap, The Fatal Inheritance, Home Life in Canada, The Christmas Tree, Lily Orme, and Grace Morton. Almost every reader of poetry in that day was familiar with her poem, \\"If I Should Die To-night\\", and the hymn, \\"Pray Without Ceasing\\". Personal life After her son died in 1882, at age twenty-four, her greatest hopes were then pinned on her young grandson. In 1883 or earlier, Skelton was a patient at the Sanitarium at Battle Creek, Michigan. She In Germany, Skelton lived in Giessen, Darmstadt, and Heidelberg. In Canada, she lived in Toronto (1857-1877). In the United States, she resided in Ohio (1880); Michigan (1880); Illinois (1883); California (1883-); Idaho (1886-1887); and finally in Pacific Grove, California where she died in Pacific Grove, California, August 22, 1900.

At the time of her disappearance, the 35-year-old mother of five was living with her boyfriend, Brooks Houck, their two-year-old son, and her other children. Houck was the last person to see her, stating ‚Äúshe was on her phone playing games‚Äù at their home when he went to bed. She was gone the next morning when he woke up, and her car was not in the driveway. Her family began to worry after multiple attempts to contact her that day failed. Two days later, on July 5, Crystal‚Äôs 2007 Chevrolet was found parked with a flat tire by mile marker 14 of the Bluegrass Parkway. The keys were still in the ignition and her purse and cellphone were also found inside. She was officially reported missing by her mother, Sherry Ballard, the same day.  Suspects  The Ballard family was very vocal about their suspicion of Brooks Houck having some sort of involvement in Crystal‚Äôs disappearance early on in the case. In an interview, Crystal‚Äôs sister said, ‚Äú[Brooks] has not offered once to search, or help, or do anything for the family.‚Äù On July 8, Houck was brought in by the Nelson County Sheriff‚Äôs Office for questioning. Nick Houck, Brooks' brother and a Bardstown Police officer, called mid- interview and told him not to speak with police. The next day, Nick was called to testify in front of a grand jury, which led police to suspect he also had involvement in the disappearance. It is at this time that Nick stopped cooperating with the Sheriff‚Äôs Office; however, he agreed to a polygraph test after being interviewed by Kentucky State Police. Nick finally took a polygraph test on July 20, after being contacted by the FBI. The examiner expressed ‚Äúgrave concerns‚Äù about the results with Bardstown Police Chief McCubbin. On October 16, 2015, Nick was fired from the Bardstown Police Department and Brooks was officially named a suspect in the case. Sign along the Bluegrass Parkway with information on Crystal's disappearance near where her car was found abandoned. (Oxygen) A white Buick became an important piece of evidence when a private investigator found that one was parked at the Houck farm the night Rogers disappeared. The Houck brother‚Äôs grandmother, Anna Whitesides, owned a white Buick but sold it several weeks after Rogers went missing. Authorities issued a subpoena for the 82-year-old to testify in front of a grand jury. The subpoena stated the car may have been used to dispose of a body, cleaned, and sold in an attempt to prevent evidence from being discovered. Whitesides refused to testify in front of a grand jury. Attorney Jason Floyd said her statement to police and the car buyer‚Äôs information was enough. A judge later ruled to keep all future proceedings involving Whitesides confidential. In August of 2016, police searched the residences of Whitesides and Nick Houck for DNA. Despite multiple search efforts and a $100,000 reward being offered for any information, Rogers remains missing. Ramon Pineiroa, the new Nelson County Sheriff appointed in 2019, has stated his commitment to solving the case. In an interview, Pineiroa said the agency has a good idea of what happened to Rogers, and his mission is to find enough facts and evidence to make an arrest.  Tommy Ballard  Crystal Roger‚Äôs father, Tommy Ballard, went hunting on Ballard‚Äôs private property with his 12-year-old grandson on the morning of November 19, 2016.

In early paintings, Hogin reworked conventions of Romantic allegorical painting that imbued animals and nature with symbols of tranquility, innocence and harmony with humanity, substituting insolent beasts that critic Kathryn Hixson suggested sat in defiance of a sentimentality that often served as cover for industrial-age exploitation. Monumental works such as Posse and War (both 1991) depicted snarling, scowling and grinning menageries arranged in historical or heroic tableaux whose compositions derived from works by artists such as Gainsborough or Copley.Yood, James. \\"Laurie Hogin, Peter Miller Gallery,\\" Artforum, December 1990, p. 145.

He is the founder and president of Ashinaga and the founder and headmaster of Kokorojuku dormitory.  Early life  Yoshiomi Tamai was born in Ikeda, Osaka, on 6 February 1935 in 1958, he graduated from Shiga University with a degree in economics. In 1961, he left his job at a brokerage firm to pursue a career in economic journalism. In 1964, Tamai's mother died after being involved in a traffic accident caused by a reckless driver. At that time, Tamai decided he would become Japan's first \\"traffic critic.\\" Over the next few years, his wife was diagnosed with cancer and passed away at 29 years old. These two losses were the starting point for Tamai's work on the Ashinaga movement.  Association for Traffic Accident Orphans  In 1966, Tamai began appearing as a regular guest in a weekly traffic accident prevention corner on the Katsura Kokinji Afternoon Show (TV Asahi), showcasing problems such as the rise in auto insurance premiums and campaigning for the introduction of corporate manslaughter in the Penal Code of Japan. In October 1968, Tamai and Shinji Okajima, who had lost his sister and nephew in a traffic accident, launched the Association to Support Traffic Accidents Orphans and held their first street fundraising campaign in Tokyo. In 1969, the overwhelming public reaction to the collection of poems by traffic accident orphans Tengoku ni iru ot≈çsama (My Father Is in Heaven) prompted the House of Representatives' Budget Committee to formally establish an Association for Traffic Accidents Orphans. The association's purpose was to provide high-school and university students who had lost one or both parents in traffic accidents with student loans. Tamai was appointed as executive director of the association, while Shigeo Nagano, who used to appear with him on the Katsura Kokinji Afternoon Show, was appointed as president. Among the young talents Tamai recruited into the organization, there were future National Diet members Takashi Yamamoto and Osamu Fujimura.  Kokorojuku and Ashinaga  In 1978, Tamai founded the Kokorojuku dormitory in Hino, Tokyo and was appointed as its headmaster. In 1989, he won the Asahi Shimbun Social Welfare Award. Around this time, a part of the Association for Traffic Accident Orphans began accusing Tamai of disloyalty for his interest in supporting other orphaned students, such as those who lost their parents to natural disasters. At the same time, some former Government bureaucrats who were working in the organization fell under suspicion of being too heavily influenced by their political affiliations. Tamai, who opposed the presence of revolving door personnel, ultimately decided to create a new, strictly non-political association in support of all orphaned students. The new organization, established in 1993, was named Ashinaga. Yutaka Takeda, then-CEO of Nippon Steel, was appointed as president of Ashinaga, while Tamai himself was appointed as vice-president.  Other philanthropic work  After the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995, Tamai started working on providing support for children who had lost one or both parents in the disaster, as well as conducting a comprehensive survey of all previous student loan recipients. In 1998, he took on the role of president at Ashinaga. In 1999, Ashinaga raised funds from donors in over 150 foreign countries, as well as Japan, and used these resources to build Rainbow House, a facility for the emotional care of orphaned children in Kobe. Since 2000, Tamai has been working to reduce extreme poverty in the world and he has established Rainbow Houses in several developing countries. He has also organized a number of international meetings for orphans of war, terrorism, AIDS, and natural disasters. In June 2010, his collection of essays Dakara, Ashinaga und≈ç wa suteki da (The Beauty of the Ashinaga Movement) was published for Hihy≈çsha's \\"Psycho Critique 13\\" series. In 2011, after the Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, Tamai announced the construction of three new Rainbow Houses in Tohoku. Since 2012, Tamai has worked on developing the Ashinaga Africa Initiative, a project that aims to support the higher education of orphaned students from 49 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The goal of this project is to foster future leaders who will bring positive change to their home countries and work to reduce poverty in the region.

He served as the first agricultural chemist of Mysore state in India. He established a laboratory for chemical analysis and began field experiments to study plant nutrition and also worked on chemical problems involved in the processing of sugar from sugarcane.  Life and work  Parents, Kathinka and Adalbert Lehmann, c. 1863 Lehmann was born in Orillia, Ontario, the first son of Adalbert Ludwig Lehmann and Kathinka Helene Friedereike (born Bruch, she came from Oldenburg and had been in Belgium with an uncle who was physician to King Leopold while studying French and English) a family of German settlers who farmed around Sparrow Lake. Adolph graduated in 1889 from the Ontario Agricultural College (then called the Guelph Agricultural College) and then went to the University of Leipzig where he studied under Johannes Wislicenus and received a doctorate for studies on the reduction of dibenzene diphenylbutadiene to tetraphenylbenzene. He subsequently worked at the Dominion Experimental Farm, Ottawa as an assistant chemist to Frank Thomas Shutt and as a chemist in New Orleans. He also gave lectures on fungi and other aspects of microscopic life for members of the Ottawa Field Naturalists' Club.  India  In 1898 he moved to India to set up the department of agriculture in Mysore State. Lehmann's appointment was based on the recommendations of the Voelcker commission to the government of India. Among his achievements were the establishment of rigorous experimental techniques based on pot cultures, field plots, and developing chemical assays for phosphorus in plant and animal matter (including studies on the nutritive value of \\"famine foods\\"). He studied soil fertility, and conducted research on improving the process of converting sugarcane juice to sugar (reducing losses by neutralizing with lime before boiling), treating water for drinking, and in paper making. In 1908, as his appointment term ended,[Bangalore]. The Pioneer, 26 February 1908, p. 3. shortly after the death of his wife, the Government of Mysore decided not to renew the position of Agricultural Chemist. He also worked with coffee planters in attempts to improve the quality and yield of coffee. The Planters' Association resolved in a meeting \\"That this Association deplores the retrograde policy of the Mysore Government with regard to agriculture by which the services of Dr Lehmann are lost to the Province. It desires to place on record its high appreciation of the valuable services rendered to the planting industry by Dr. Lehmann.\\" Lehmann was quoted by the planters as saying - \\"what you need is experiment, and experiment, and experiment.\\" Lehmann had worked for nine years before he returned to Canada, to work initially at Queen's University, and then at the University of Alberta as a professor.

The series is based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow, a costumed vigilante created by Mort Weisinger and George Papp, and is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with other Arrowverse television series. Executive Producers Marc Guggenheim and Beth Schwartz returned as co- showrunners of the 10-episode final season. Stephen Amell stars as Oliver Queen, with principal cast members David Ramsey as John Diggle, Rick Gonzalez as Rene Ramirez, Juliana Harkavy as Dinah Drake and Katie Cassidy as Laurel Lance also returning from previous seasons. Katherine McNamara, Ben Lewis, and Joseph David-Jones, who previously recurred as the adult versions of Mia Smoak, William Clayton, and Connor Hawke, were all promoted to starring status, as was LaMonica Garrett, who stars across multiple Arrowverse shows as the Monitor. Former series regulars Emily Bett Rickards, Colin Donnell, Susanna Thompson, Paul Blackthorne, Colton Haynes, John Barrowman, Willa Holland and Josh Segarra all returned for the final season as guests. The series follows Oliver Queen, who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on Lian Yu, an island in the North China Sea, before returning home to Starling City (later renamed \\"Star City\\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. In the eighth season, Oliver will fight in a battle that will have the multiverse hanging in the balance. The series was renewed for its eighth and final season on January 31, 2019, and filming began in Vancouver, British Columbia, in July 2019. The eighth episode features the sixth annual Arrowverse crossover with TV series Supergirl, Batwoman, The Flash, and Legends of Tomorrow also taking part. The ninth episode was set as a backdoor pilot to a potential spin-off titled Green Arrow and the Canaries which takes place in the year 2040.

On March 6, 2019, it was announced that it would be the final season of the series, with an abbreviated ten-episode order. Stephen Amell, who stars as Oliver Queen / Green Arrow, had approached series co-creator Greg Berlanti towards the end of the sixth season about \\"mov[ing] on\\" following the expiration of his contract at the end of the seventh season. He had hoped that the series could continue without him, but Berlanti and showrunners Marc Guggenheim and Beth Schwartz decided to conclude the series with a shortened eighth season, which Amell agreed to. Berlanti, Guggenheim and Schwartz released a press statement saying, \\"This was a difficult decision to come to, but like every hard decision we‚Äôve made for the past seven years, it was with the best interests of Arrow in mind [...] We're heartened by the fact that Arrow has birthed an entire universe of shows that will continue on for many years to come. We're excited about crafting a conclusion that honors the show, its characters and its legacy and are grateful to all the writers, producers, actors, and ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì the incredible crew that has sustained us and the show for over seven years.\\" Speaking at San Diego Comic-Con ahead of the season premiere, Guggenheim commented on the difficulty of approaching the final season without Emily Bett Rickards, who made the decision to step away from her role as Felicity Smoak at the end of the seventh season. He stated that \\"for the longest time, I've been saying you can't do the show without Emily Rickards. And I think, if the show ‚Äì if the conversations had been, 'we'll do 22 episodes without Emily,' I would've said, 'you can't do that'\\", and that the shorter ten-episode run, combined with the crossover, made the prospect feel \\"a little more realistic\\".  Writing  As with the seventh season of Arrow, the eighth season makes extensive use of flashforwards. Stephen Amell revealed that, unlike the serialized approach of previous seasons, this one would follow a more episodic approach due to the limited number of episodes. Katie Cassidy, who plays Laurel Lance, supported Amell's claim, saying each episode would feel like a \\"miniature movie\\". The penultimate episode, which serves as a backdoor pilot to Green Arrow and the Canaries was originally intended to be titled after the Bruce Springsteen song \\"Livin' in the Future\\", continuing the series' tradition of having the penultimate episode of every season titled after a Springsteen song. Because the studio mandated that the backdoor pilot be titled after the planned spin-off series, the writers were forced to scrap the original title.  Casting  Main cast members Stephen Amell, David Ramsey, Rick Gonzalez, Juliana Harkavy and Katie Cassidy return as Oliver Queen / Green Arrow, John Diggle, Rene Ramirez, Dinah Drake and Earth-2's Laurel Lance respectively. Following the announcement that she would be leaving the series at the end of its seventh season, this will be the first and only season not to feature Emily Bett Rickards, who portrayed Felicity Smoak, as either a recurring or main cast member, although the producers left open the possibility of her making a guest appearance in the final season. Rickards appears as Felicity through archive footage in the episodes \\"Welcome to Hong Kong\\" and \\"Green Arrow & The Canaries\\". In November 2019, Amell confirmed that Rickards would return for the series finale. In June 2019, Joseph David-Jones, who recurred in the seventh season as the adult version of Connor Hawke, was promoted to the main cast, and that July Katherine McNamara and Ben Lewis were also promoted to regular status in their roles as the adult versions of Mia Smoak and William Clayton respectively. It was also announced that former series regulars Colin Donnell, Josh Segarra, John Barrowman and Susanna Thompson would reprise their roles as Tommy Merlyn, Adrian Chase, Malcolm Merlyn and Moira Queen in a guest capacity. In August, it was announced that Colton Haynes, who portrayed Roy Harper as a series regular in the seventh season, would not return with the same status, though Schwartz stated that she hoped to have him back in some capacity. Haynes said he did not exit the season, but that he was \\"not asked to come back for the final season as a series regular\\", and added that Roy is \\"never gone for too long\\". In September, it was announced that Willa Holland would return as Thea Queen in a recurring role, after departing as a regular in the sixth season and returning as a guest star in the seventh. In the same month, Charlie Barnett was cast in the role of the adult version of John Diggle Jr. In October, it was announced that Haynes would appear in the season in a recurring role. In November, it was announced that Paul Blackthorne would return as Quentin Lance in a recurring role, after departing as a regular in the sixth season and returning as a guest star in the seventh.  Design  In July 2019, a new Green Arrow costume was unveiled on the Entertainment Weekly magazine cover. A new Spartan costume was revealed by Guggenheim and a new Black Canary costume was revealed in the season's first trailer.  Filming  Filming began on July 11, 2019, and lasted until November 13. The season's third episode, \\"Leap of Faith\\", marks Cassidy's directorial debut. On October 21, filming for the ninth episode, the backdoor pilot for Green Arrow and the Canaries, began.  Arrowverse tie-ins  In December 2018, during the end of the annual crossover \\"Elseworlds\\", a follow-up crossover ‚Äì titled \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" and based on the comic book series of the same name ‚Äì was announced. The crossover took place over five episodes ‚Äì three in December 2019 and two in January 2020.  Release   Broadcast  The season premiered on October 15, 2019, in the United States on The CW. Additionally, The CW aired a retrospective, titled \\"Hitting the Bullseye\\", to \\"celebrate the eighth season\\", which preceded the series finale.  Home media  The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 28, 2020 with special features including the show's 2019 San Diego Comic-Con panel, the special \\"Hitting the Bullseye\\" and all five episodes of the sixth annual Arrowverse crossover event titled \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\".  Reception   Critical response  The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 91% approval rating for the eighth season, with an average rating of 7.89/10 based on 120 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Oliver Queen's final adventure hits emotional peaks while spearheading the game-changing \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths,\\" giving the Emerald Archer a rousing sendoff.\\" Katie Cassidy's portrayal of Earth-2 Laurel Lance was praised by critics, with TVLine calling her development \\"one of the most enjoyable aspects of Arrow‚Äòs 10-episode farewell run\\".Arrow Has a Secret Weapon During Its Final Season.

Background The locomotives were acquired in 1905 about the time DW&WR; network expansion to Waterford was complete. They joined the DW&WR;'s other four 4-4-0s which had been in service for 10 years. History The build quality of No. 67 was found to be wanting. It required a new front tube plate after only four years and it transpired the DW&WR; had required Beyer-Peacock to cut costs.

She created over a thousand artworks, including landscapes, still lifes, decorative art, murals, and portraits. Early life She was born Nibhanani, to Saratkumari Devi and Dr. Bhagaban Chandra Bose at Jiagunje, in the Murshidabad district of present West Bengal. During her youth, her family relocated to Gomoh and then to Chandpur. There, in 1927, at the age of fourteen, her brought her to the attention of Monoranjan Chowdhury, a member of a highly educated and cultured Zamindar family of Lamchor (Noakhali district of Bangladesh), and he arranged for her to marry his younger brother, Niranjan Chowdhury.  Life in Shantiniketan  The Kalo Bari at Kala Bhavana In 1928, Chodhury's in-laws sent her to Visva Bharati University, Shantiniketan, along with her husband. The founder and head of the university, Rabindranath Tagore, met with her and sent her to Nandalal Bose and Dinendranath Tagore to learn painting and music respectively at Kala Bhavana, the university's fine arts faculty. He subsequently gave her a new name, Chitranibha (Chitra means painting and Nibha means beauty), in light of her artistic skill. Chowdhury would later write a book entitled Rabindrasmriti, which provided a vivid account of how Rabindranath Tagore was her source of sustenance throughout her artistic career and life. Chitranibha Chowdhury's training in art continued for five years under the supervision of Nandalal Bose. During this time, she participated in the construction of the famous Kalo Bari (Black House) at Kala Bhavana, along with Ramkinkar Baij and others and her mural work, Shiber Biye, is still preserved. She received special permission to paint portraits of visitors to Santiniketan - these include several eminent figures of Indian political and cultural history, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, C. Rajagopalachari, Bidhan Chandra Roy, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Niels Bohr, and Sarojini Naidu, and were later praised by art critics. Pieces of her work were published in the journal Jayshree. After the completion of her formal training at Kala Bhavana in 1934, she joined the faculty as the first female professor in 1935, at the wish of Rabindranath Tagore. Mural at Noakhali In 1937, she had to resign her position at Kala Bhavan and join her in-laws' household at Noakhali, but she continued to produce art in as many ways as possible. She engaged the women of her village in music, art, and craft and established an institution of her own. She organised exhibitions of village crafts at the Durga Puja festivals. In Noakhali, Chowdhury created a mural at 12 Topkhana Road, Shegunbagicha, the residence of her brother-in-law Professor J.K Chowdhury of the Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University. The entire mural survived until 2010, when it was destroyed during renovation of the building. In the late 1940s, Chowdhury returned to Shantiniketan in order to have her daughter educated at Visva Bharati. Later life After Partition in 1947, Chowdhury and her family relocated to Kolkata. There she joined Bani Bhavan, an institute that trained poor women in arts and crafts. She taught there from 1960 to 1973. Retrospectives of her works were presented in Kolkata at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1976 and at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture in 1982. She died in 1999. She had two children: a daughter, Chitralekha Chowdhury, a physicist and singer who has preserved many of her works, and a son, Ranajit Chowdhury.  List of Paintings  Chowdhury's work included episodes and characters from ancient Indian literature, landscapes, depictions of life in of rural Bengal, and portraits. She painted in watercolours, oils, pastels, and crayons.

Ali Wallace (fl. 1840-1907) was the name used by a Malay who accompanied and assisted Alfred Russel Wallace in his travels and explorations from 1855 to 1862. Initially recruited as a cook for his expedition, Ali was later responsible for independently collecting many significant specimens that are credited to Wallace. He also made observations of the birds and the people which were communicated to Wallace. It has been estimated that Ali collected and prepared nearly 5,150 bird specimens. Many of his specimens survive in collections of natural history museums. Travels with Wallace Alfred Russel Wallace travelled to the Malay archipelago in March 1854 along with his collecting assistant Charles Martin Allen (1839‚Äì92). During his travels he hired as many as 1200 people at various points of time and in various places. Among them some made an impression on him and were credited in his writings. When they arrived in Singapore on 18 April 1854, Wallace hired a Malay boy named Ali. He described him: Wallace's standardwing, the specimen of which was collected and described by Ali Ali later became an expert at shooting and skinning birds. He accompanied Wallace and Allen and became one his most trusted servants. On Aru, it was probably Ali who collected the specimens of the king bird-of-paradise (Cicinnurus regius). He also collected an ivory- breasted pitta (described as Pitta gigas) from Halmahera. Ali accompanied Wallace to New Guinea in 1858 before returning to Ternate. It was on Batchian on 24 August 1858 that Ali went to collect birds while Wallace collected insects. Wallace wrote: The species was named by George Robert Gray as Semioptera wallacii or Wallace's standardwing. While at Ternate, Ali married a woman and he did not join Wallace in 1859. Ali joined Wallace again in 1861 on a trip to the island of Bouru. In 1862 Wallace went to Singapore where he began preparations to return home to England. Here he provided Ali with money, guns, ammunition and various supplies. Wallace had him photographed and in his 1905 book notes: Life after Wallace In 1907 American herpetologist Thomas Barbour was in Ternate and he noted in his 1943 memoir: A 2015 analysis by John van Wyhe and Gerrell M. Drawhorn noted that Ali was more than just a working assistant but that he truly immersed himself into the study of birds. Searching for Ali Wallace, a documentary film, was produced in 2016.

Ahrons indicated he had no idea purpose these particular pair of engines were ordered for. Grierson, the Locomotive Superintendent, is understood to have held the theory that tenders were less economic than tank engines due to the need to haul around the weight of the tender., more conventional thinking is tank engines are generally better for short trips, suburban and branch line work; and tender engines are better suited to longer main line trips with their higher water capacity and possibly better running at speed. In the event by the time they arrived, Robert Cronin was locomotive superintendent and these locomotives, named Lismore and Clonmel respectively, were found to have problems by exceeding the maximum axle load and having issues with hot-running axle boxes. After the short period of only eleven years in 1908 Cronin rebuilt the locomotives as 0-6-0 tender engines with Belpaire boliers, the new tenders being built by the Grand Canal Street railway works. The rebuild produced engines of strong power however they were noted for very high coal and water consumption and a tendency to stall on the gradient if the boiler pressure dropped. There was usually no trouble restarting once the boiler pressure had been regained. Engine No. 4 History On the merger of the railways in Ireland to Great Southern Railways in 1925 these locomotives became allocated class 448 with numbers 4 and 5 and they were finally withdrawn in with No. 4 being withdrawn in 1940. No. 5 survived the nationalisation to C.I.√â in 1945 and in an assessment in 1948 the rating of the class was \\"quite good\\". That did not seem to stop No. 5 being withdrawn in 1950. Engine number 4 had a couple of other milestones. It was the last locomotive to be rebuilt at Grand Canal Street and was the final locomotive to retain Dublin and South Eastern Railway (DSER) livery until being painted GSR grey/black in 1930.

It has smooth bark, narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds hanging downwards in groups of three, usually red flowers and prominently ribbed fruit with a double flange around the rim.fruit Description Eucalyptus armillata is a mallee that grows to a height of about and forms a lignotuber. The bark is pale grey to white turning pink to reddish purple and smooth over the length of the tree. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are dull green and narrow lance-shaped. The adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped, glossy, long and wide. The flower buds droop downwards, mostly in groups of three on a thickened peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel up to long. The mature buds are shaped like two cones joined at the base, long and wide with a prominent flange below the operculum. The flowers are usually red, occasionally pale creamy yellow, and the fruit are shaped like the flower buds, long and wide with ribs on the side and a double flange around the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus armillata was first formally described in 2012 by Dean Nicolle and Malcolm E. French from a specimen collected south of Wongan Hills. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (armillata) is a Latin word meaning \\"ornamented with a bracelet\\", referring to the prominent flange at the top of the floral cup and around the rim of the fruit. Distribution and habitat The red-flowered mallee grows in malle vegetation, usually on level ground from near Corrow and Calingiri to near Beacon and Wubin in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions.

While there, she and the other people who lived in Kitakama were devastated by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The earthquake destroyed Shiga's studio, but more importantly it killed sixty people in the small village. Her \\"Rasen Kaigan\\" (spiral coast) series was inspired by the events of that day. In 2012 Shiga won the Higashikawa Prize for new artists.  Style  Shiga has been compared to Rinko Kawauchi, one of her contemporaries, but her style is more expressionist. Her photographs have been called \\"dreamscapes\\" by Marco Bohr (in Time magazine), who also compared her to Masatoshi Naito. Her images are surreal and gloomy, but mostly inspired by the places around her.

He was largely self-taught.Biographical data @ the RKD Biography He was born in poverty but his talent for art developed early. Before he could write, he could draw and was teaching other children. He began attending secondary school at the age of eight and it was not until four years later that he received his first formal art instruction. His studies were completed at the age of eighteen and he became a substitute drawing teacher at a local school. Two years later, he began teaching at a Hauptschule in Neubau. He initially shared a room with Anton Petter, who would later become Director of the Academy of Fine Arts.Biography from the Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich @ WikiSource In 1803, he took his first painting excursion to Upper Austria and Salzburg. It was the first time he had seen such landscapes in person, rather than vicariously through the works of other artists. His desire to learn more was such that he went to Dresden solely to visit the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister and copy two works each by Claude Lorrain and Jacob van Ruisdael. Around this time, his original works caught the attention of a certain Count Lambert, who purchased a few and provided some much needed publicity. Soon, he became generally popular among the nobility, including Emperor Francis II. In 1815, he was elected to the Academy of Fine Arts and became a teacher there the following year. One of his best known students was Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller. In 1817 and 1818, he undertook a major painting trip to Italy; visiting Rome, Naples and Florence. The Emperor was so impressed with the results that he arranged to have some of his earlier works placed in the Belvedere. Later, King Ludwig I of Bavaria would provide him with major commissions. It has been said that the quality of his work decreased as his earnings increased.

The first Aurat March was held on 8 March 2018 in Karachi. In 2019, it was organised in Lahore and Karachi by a women's collective called Hum Auratein (We the Women), and in other parts of the country, including Islamabad, Hyderabad, Quetta, Mardan, and Faislabad, by Women democratic front (WDF), Women Action Forum (WAF), and others. The march was endorsed by the Lady Health Workers Association, and included representatives from multiple women's-rights organizations. The march called for more accountability for violence against women, and to support for women who experience violence and harassment at the hands of security forces, in public spaces, at home, and at the workplace. Reports suggest that more and more women rushed to join the march until the crowd was became scattered. Women (as well as men) carried posters bearing phrases such as 'Ghar ka Kaam, Sab ka Kaam', and 'Women are humans, not honour' became a rallying cry. Women dressed in T-shirts that read \\"my favorite season is the fall (of patriarchy)\\" and \\"girls just want fundamental human rights\\". Some wore masks of dead social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch and one group held ‚Äòpatriarchy‚Äôs janaza‚Äô (funeral procession of patriarchy) on their shoulders. Participants were from all walks of life and included many eminent people. Social media and YouTube video messages expressed support for those who were marching. Nimra Afzal claimed in her article, that Aurat March is a women's empowerment movement which is not restricted to just peace rallies, raising awareness placards or sloganeering for women's equality in a patriarchal society. The movement is just not man-hating or elitist but a movement that asks for public spaces, with hashtags like #JaggaDein (Give space). Aurat March 2019 A mother with her young daughters in Aurat March 2020  Context  Against the backdrop of deep rooted socio-religio-political patriarchal structures of Pakistan's society and state, women in Pakistan face many types of social ills, systemic discrimination depriving fundamental rights amounting to sexual apartheid including, but not limited to forced & early childhood marriage, lack of enough formal public education opportunities, lack of freedom and lack of access to use two wheeler, lack of free & safe access to public spaces, domestic violence, sexual harassment & sexual violence at homes, at public transport & at work places plus wage gap, over powering of their sexual freedom & right of choice and equality under religious garb. Women also face many serious crimes like appropriation of rights & abuse for revenge including but not limited to acid attacks, honor killings without being addressed, regularly silenced by society, frequently overlooked by state. With the guidance of feminist movement, new generation of women's collective started challenging status quo with the help of social media in parallel to #MeToo movement , in an effort to take equal rights movement to ordinary women. Hence they started organizing annual Aurat March on international women's day. In an article published on 14 February 2016 in Forbes, journalist Sonya Rehman wrote, \\"while the world celebrates Valentine's Day, a number of Pakistani women succumb to honor killings by their very own kin\\". An honour killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the belief the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or community. The death of the victim is viewed as a way to restore the reputation and honour of the family. Pakistan has world's highest prevalence of honor killings. Pakistan, where 60 percent of the population is below age 30 and half are under 18, are influenced more by global trends than traditions. Valentine's Day serves annually as a flash point of the culture war in Pakistan. Diaa Hadid says that it is a cause c√©l√®bre for religious hard-liners, affording conservatives a chance assert themselves as the caretakers of Islamic identity. While many Pakistanis celebrate the Valentine's Day's festivities, Pakistan has officially banned Valentine's Day, and the Islamist orthodoxy has taken steps to obstruct celebrations, Women's freedom is scorned by conservatives and extremist institutions in Pakistani society. The focus is not simply to restrict women's free expression on a particular day, but rather to subjugate women to strengthen male dominance through their seclusion from public life. The complex rules of purdah (seclusion) which reinforce chastity and family honor, have led to socio-cultural disparities, in every aspect of women's lives. Lacking an understanding of their civil, legal, and political rights, women's opportunities for participation in society are limited and they are left vulnerable to exploitation, oppression, and abusive control by others without adequate recourse. Technically, love is not haram (forbidden) in Islam, but gender segregation and gender mixing prohibitions stifle the freedom of Muslim women. Access to public spaces for women is severely constrained and conservative, rigid interpretations of Islam create limits on women's behavior. In the conservative view, women are not allowed to show their faces, not allowed to talk to unrelated men unless the communication is essential, and are unable to choose their own life partner, as that is a decision made by the head of the family. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan lists 460 cases of reported honour killings in 2017, with 194 males and 376 females as victims. Of these killings, 253 were sparked by disapproval of illicit relations and 73 by disapproval of marriage choice. Additionally, out of the known suspect relationship with victims, over 93% were family relationships. Although these are most likely only a sample of the actual honour killings that were completed during 2017, it still gives a glimpse into characteristics of honour killings in Pakistan. Sources disagree as to the exact number by year, but according to Human Rights Watch, NGOs/INGOs in the area estimate that around 1000 honour killings are carried out each year in Pakistan. With such horrific background of fundamental human right violations of women of Pakistan, millennial young adults started demanding access to public spaces with movements like Girls at Dhabas which gained significant traction from women across South Asia since 2015. and so also new generation of feminist thought started breaking the silence around issues like sexual autonomy and agency as soon as they did get opportunity to express through some of placards of Aurat March, says Zoya Rehman. That is how the March which was primarily intended for gender equity in multiple range of issues also came to explore construction of narratives relating to socio religiopolitical exploitation of women sexuality in Pakistan and challenge posed to sexual injustices through Aurat March by new generation feminist became part of Pakistan's national debate.  Manifesto  Manifesto demands economic justice, including implementation of labour rights, the Sexual Harassment Against Women in the Workplace Act 2010, recognition of women's input to the ‚Äòcare economy‚Äô as unpaid labour, and provision of maternity leaves and day care centres to ensure women's inclusion in the labour force. Among other things, it also demands access to safe drinking water and air, protection of animals and wildlife, recognition of women's participation in production of food and cash crops, access to a fair justice system, inclusion of women with disabilities as well as the transgender community, reproductive justice, access to public spaces inclusion in educational institutions, rights of religious minorities, promotion of an anti-war agenda, end to police brutality and enforced disappearances.  Themes  According to Zuneera Shah, while etymology of word 'Aurat' (Woman) indicates being misogynistic Since Western supremacy over feminist movements feeds into a distaste towards feminism in countries such as Pakistan. Localization of the struggle for women's rights has importance among South Asian activists and feminists the way to relate the feminist movement. Shah says With the Aurat March, terms such as 'pidar shahi' (patriarchy) and 'aurat march' are being circulated and created. Theme for 2018 march was 'Equality‚Äô whereas theme for 2019 march is 'Sisterhood and Solidarity'. Nighat Dad explains in her article that \\"The agenda of this march was to demand resources and dignity for women, for transgender community, for religious minorities and for those on the economic margins but more importantly to acknowledge that women‚Äôs emancipation is inherently linked with the improvement of all mistreated groups and minorities.As per Leena Ghani theme for 2020 Aurat March is Khudmukhtari (autonomy) and violence, both sexual and economic.  Women's March 2019  Mera Jism Meri Marzi (My Body, My Choice) Women displaying placards during Aurat March 2019 Placards displayed by Marchers during Aurat March 2019 Posters, Slogans and Media Debates The hundreds of posters featured at women's day march across Pakistan highlighted fundamental rights issues such as access to education and employment. Mera Jism Meri Marzi (My body, my choice) became a main and most talked slogan of Aurat March with a lot of debates, discussions in country over the years. This led to slogans like 'Why are you afraid of my self determination', 'A woman's right to autonomy on her own body', 'In fact, everyone should get to decide what happens to their body, for themselves' Some of March 2018 posters included slogans like \\"Our rights are not for grab neither are we\\", \\"Girls just wanna have Fundamental human rights\\", 'Transwomen are women shut up', \\"Tu kare tou Stud, Mai Karun tou Slut (If you do it then Stud but If I do it then Slut)\\", \\"Safe street program for women\\", \\"Stop being Menstrual phobic\\", \\"Consent ki Tasbeeh Rozana Parhen (Ask for consent every time)\\", \\"Paratha Rolls Not Gender Roles.\\" In March 2019, some posters also appeared saying \\"Man of quality will never be afraid of equality, \\"Jab tak aurat tang rahay gi, jang rahay gi, jang rahay gi\\", and \\"Keep your dick pics to yourself\\". Another had a drawing of a vagina and two ovaries and the words: \\"Grow a pair!\\" Another poster said, \\"If you like the headscarf so much, tie it around your eyes\\", one depicting a girl sitting with her legs spread out, Lo Beth Gayi Sahi Se or the irreverent Akeli Awara Azaad \\"Nazar teri gandi aur purdah mein keroun\\" (Why do I adopt veil cause of your bad habit of ogling) \\"Aaj waqai maa behn ek ho rahi hai\\" depicts all women coming together without differences. One poster read that maybe we haven't seen any woman as independent as a 'tawaaif', so this is the reason we (some of our society) consider every independent woman a 'tawaaif', another \\"My shirt is not short, it's your mindset that is narrow\\", and posters like \\"these are my streets too\\" claimed public spaces. Ailia Zehra deconstructs a poster in her article that says \\"If Cynthia does it, she‚Äôs applauded. If I do it, I‚Äôm the villain\\". For those who do not know, Cynthia Ritchie is an American social media influencer facilitated by Pakistan establishment's whitewash for state propaganda. This woman rode a bicycle somewhere in Pakistan and tweeted her picture in a bid to bring down local feminists by implying that they lie when they say women cannot freely access public spaces. This placard admirably summarizes what is wrong with an American woman lecturing Pakistani women on freedom and mobility. Ailia Zehra regrets double standards saying Yes, Pakistani men are fine with women riding bicycles on the roads ‚Äì as long as the women are white. Nighat Dad who organized the women's march in Lahore, said people were angry over the posters because most Pakistanis, especially men were not yet ready to allow them free choice. As per Nighat Dad, restricted topics like women's rights to their own bodies, their sexuality, are being discussed for the first time was an immense success of the march. Dad complained, \\"Online harassments has gone too far in terms of death and rape threats to the organizers and also to the marchers.\\" Many grumbled that the marchers were \\"vulgar\\" opportunists who had transgressed on conservative values in the Muslim-majority country and \\"undermined\\" a legitimate fight for rights with a liberal, anti-Islamic agenda. Feminist writer Sadia Khatri exposes this built up of narrative in her article, \\"Should feminists claim Aurat March's Vulgar Posters? Yes absolutely.\\" Khatri says people have been posting photographs showing the posters that didn't get as much air-time, posters addressing the range of 'important' causes that news anchors have accused the March of ignoring, like education, inheritance and marital rights. By bringing up the manifesto to defend the posters, for instance, Pakistan Feminists isolated themselves from the supposedly provocative posters, and in fact confirm their 'vulgarity'. It implies that Pakistani feminists agree that feminism should operate within the bounds of 'respectability'. According to her accepting narratives prescribing boundaries of respectability are traps that needs to be avoided by feminists and not to be allowed to be cemented in any social discourse. Feminism with conditions is no feminism. It maintains the division between what is ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô and what is 'immodest', what is 'public' and 'private', allowed and not. It pits the two against each other, rewarding the feminists who rally for legal rights and work-life balance and slut-shaming those who reclaim gendered slurs and carry the posters they did at the March. She questions whether feminism to allow discriminate and gatekeeping, and this gatekeeping is patriarchy's way of bolstering the binary of purpose vs pleasure, where the feminism of purpose (health, education, marital rights) is 'good' feminism, and the feminism of pleasure (sexual politics, bodily autonomy, agency over time and leisure) is 'bad' feminism, 'immoral' and 'frivolous'. She explains as feminists use the language of real and serious, end up creating a distinction between 'actual' issues and 'pretended' ones and rush to clarify that feminists have included 'important' causes in our demands, end up suggesting that other causes are unimportant. In an article \\"Womansplaining the Aurat March: Dear men, here‚Äôs why Pakistan‚Äôs women are asserting their rights\\" writer Rimmel Mohydin handles misogynist objections to the Women's march slogans in a different way. Rimmel Mohydin suggests those men to \\"smile, you'll look prettier that way.\\" Ms. Mohydin humorously questions Women can be the subject of many sexist jokes, but if the women crack a joke on what ground that wit is considered offensive? She says Every wisecrack, every sassy one- liner, every appealing slogan masked years and years of invisible pain that women have suffered. A Woman can tell men through their placards that she won't warm his bed if he doesn't warm his food, but what really gets misogynist mind hot and troubled is that she, a woman, could laugh at his expense. On an effort of misogynist parliamentarian's effort or agenda finding conspiracy theory behind women's march Ms. Mohydin sarcastically quips, \\"It is difficult to know where to place your feet when you find that the backs that you have been walking on are now standing up. That's why the author's compassion is with misogynist politicians\\". Referring poster slogan \\"Keep your dick pics to yourself.\\" Ms. Mohydin says What seems to have affronted the male collective the most is the shattering of a fantasy world where women enjoy being subjected to unrequested pictures of male genitals. Poster slogan has hit them hard. It has upset them. And now, they are angry and trying to speak to us in a language that they think we'll understand. They tell us this is not feminism but fail to explain how. They tell us it's about sex, and as 'respectful' women, how dare we utter of it. \\"When women make demands about their personal lives, their bodies, their sexuality, that's when people feel threatened,\\" Dad said. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs OK to ask the government for the right to education but you can't say you are happily divorced because the breakdown of a matrimony is a shameful thing, a woman‚Äôs failure, and you can‚Äôt say 'don't send me dick pics' because so-called decent women don't use expressions like dick.‚Äù Nobody seems to say anything to the sender, but the reluctant receiver is apparently the problem. Either she likes it (which, to them, makes her a 'slut') or she doesn't (which offends them). So as usual, women cannot win Ms. Mohydin says. Remaining on the same issue Ms. Mohydin strongly questions \\"Are they unsettled at the loss of this opportunity to titillate women with their phallus? Why are they all shriveling up? Have protesting women given them performance anxiety or what. Continuing her strong denunciation Ms. Mohydin says, \\"The placards were a mirror and instead of taking this moment as an opportunity to introspect, they have decided to beat their chest instead. Not their slain bodies, not their acid-burnt faces, not their immobility, not their lack of representation, not the dearth of affordable housing, not the moral policing their choices and bodies are subjected to, not the denial of female education, not the constant threat of sexual harassment and onslaught, not the social structures that cut women‚Äôs potential in half, not the exploitation, not the objectification, not the fact that for many, women are still not human. It seems to me that for them, the problem is women themselves, Ms. Mohydin rues. Shaan Shahid, arguably Pakistan‚Äôs well-known film star, wrote on Twitter he thought the posters did not \\"represent our culture, our values\\". He was criticized in return for his films that blatantly sexualize women and reduce their existence to a mere prop to exert the ‚Äòmasculinity‚Äô of his character. He defends his position as freedom of expression, but when women call out this misogynistic culture with his hypocrisy he looks down freedom of expression by women. Veena Malik, a popular actor who caused an uproar in 2012 when she appeared with scantily dressed on the cover of an Indian men's magazine, posted that the march had \\"brought humiliation to women of Pakistan\\". Twitter users were prompt to remind Veena that \\"the same women you are calling out for 'humiliating' Pakistani femininities were standing by you as mullahs imposed fatwas on you.\\" Kishwar Naheed, a poet best cherished for a poem called \\"Us sinful women\\", was seen in a video saying: \\"The next time you make such slogans, remember your culture, your traditions.\\" Sadia Khatri a feminist writer, replies back through her column in Dawn saying someone should remind Naheed, that it is specifically culture and tradition; that keeps the frivolous and the silly relegating women to private spaces where women court the greatest risks, where the threat of assault is most prevalent, and where, when women are harmed, the walls around womanhood remind women to stay silent, like ‚Äògood‚Äô, ‚Äòhonourable‚Äô women those culture and tradition are what upturned when thousands of women come out into the streets, dancing and laughing with exhilaration. According to Guardian journalist Mehreen Zahra-Malik, some of the profanity-filled tirades were frightening. A film student posted screenshots of a group of boys sexually harassing her 16-year-old younger sister online and threatening her with rape for posting on Instagram in support of the march. Pakistan is a conservative society, activists sporting simple posters like \\"You can‚Äôt say you are happily divorced' also received messages filled with sexual innuendo and threats of sexual violence. Women participating in Aurat March had received threats of physical and sexual violence from social media users after posting photographs of the posters. In Pakistan, the threats of violence are not hollow. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, roughly 500 women are killed each year by family members who believe their honour has been damaged. On 20 March 2019, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly held a protest in the reaction of the Aurat March. Rehana Ismail of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA), presented the resolution, saying that women participating in the march were holding \\"obscene\\" placards and raising slogans. The resolution said that the demands made at the march about women empowerment were \\"un-Islamic and shameful\\". One popular poster called for men to warm their own food; another asked them to find their own socks. And one read, \\"I'll warm your food but you warm your own bed.\\" As per Nida Kirmani, a feminist sociologist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences such posters got the most vitriolic responses because those challenged the intimate relations of power within the household. In a NYTimes article Mohammed Hanif says the men in Pakistan who profess to guard women, in real sense only guard for their own selfish interests. Hanif says They don't want to look for their own socks, and they don't want to control that manly urge to take selfies of their private parts and send them to random women.Hanif questions how it is okay asking young woman to stop to holding up a placard and how it can be seen as a threat to the national moral order? As per Sabahat Zakariya, a newspaper editor these kinds of slogans have unleashed a wave of masculine anxiety.  Social media hashtag  One of the hashtag at 2018 rally was #KhaanaKhudGaramKarLo (heat your own meal). Whereas in 2019 it transformed to 'Ghar ka Kam, Sab ka Kam' (House work is everyone's responsibility) slogan' 2019 March '#WhyIMarch' became the social media hashtag and slogan for the event, with many celebrities, human rights activists, and locals sharing their stories of why they marched #HumAurtein #auratmarch #AuratMarch2019 #JaggaDein. Ahead of Aurat March 2020 hashtags like #AuratMarch2020 and #MeraJismMeriMarzi are run on various platforms. Women's March 2020 Nisha Khawaja, a marcher, bringing attention to the harassment cases at work and elsewhere Zahra Khan Farooqi, a blogger, stood for the women who weren't allowed to join the march. thumbMen also joined Aurat March 2020 outside Lahore Press Club to support women's rights Aurat march was held in Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore and Quetta whereas Aurat Azadi March was held in Islamabad, Sukkur and Multan.  Aurat March Lahore Artist Shehzil Malik started collecting poster design submissions for Aurat March of 8 March 2020. Participants of the March created a Mural of posters submitted by Volunteers in Hussain Chowk of Lahore which was ransacked within hours in a hate crime attack. Janita Tahir says participants in the March are being threatened by orthodox men and need to be taken seriously before any untoward incidence could take place and government need to do needful for protection of participating women. A petition was filed in the Lahore High Court by the Judicial Activism Council Chairman to stop Aurat March 2020, calling it \\"against the very norms of Islam\\". This petition was rejected by the Lahore High Court Chief Justice who underscored that freedom of expression could not be banned. In Lahore, marchers gathered outside the Press Club and passed through Egerton Road to culminate outside Aiwan-e-Iqbal. Participants were holding a plethora of placards. Despite the social media storm before the march, men were present in large numbers in support of the Aurat March. The participants delivered speeches and held placards and banners displaying thought-provoking slogans to raise the pressing issues of gender-based violence including sexual harassment and assault in the workplace, deep-rooted misogyny and the patriarchal mindset prevalent in the society. A resolution was submitted in Punjab Assembly by Kanwal Liaquat (MPA-PMLN), demanding an end to gender discrimination. The resolution condemned under-age marriages and demanded that women be granted legal, social and economic protection. Aurat Azadi March Islamabad A petition was also filed in the Islamabad High Court to stop Aurat Azadi March 2020 which was rejected by Chief justice Athar Minallah. On March 3, extremist mob vandalised, mural of two women painted by organizers of Aurat Azadi March Islamabad. The organizers of march were given the no-objection certificate (NOC) after many days of negotiations and a range of unnecessarily strict conditions were applied in NOC. On March 8, 2020, the Aurat March procession in Pakistan's capital Islamabad was attacked by religious extremists who were holding a counter-march to celebrate Haya or modesty. It was attended by women from the Jamaat-e-Islami, JUI-F, Lal Masjid, and female students of different seminaries including Jamiat Hafsa, staged as Haya March. Bricks, stones, shoes and sticks were hurled at the peaceful marchers on the Aurat March side, leaving several people injured. Earlier even before the March, a van carrying newly-printed banners of Aurat March was stopped and driver beaten. During the March The BBC correspondent Irfana Yasser and her children were assaulted with chilli powder which temporarily blinded them. At least one media camera person hospitalized. Subsequently, the attack was stopped by the police authorities that were present, and the March continued forward despite the opposition. An FIR was registered against the men who attacked the march participants. Tooba Syed, who was the main organiser for Aurat Azadi March Islamabad says that \\"The intense post-march backlash has been driven in particular by conservative right-wing political parties who weaponise religion for their myopic political agendas. There is a generalised, uninformed criticism directed against the notion of women on the streets, outside the ‚Äòdomestic sphere‚Äô. Benefactors of a status quo that relegates women to the home to uphold gender segregation norms and prevent their participation in public life have lashed out with pernicious and pervasive force against several placards women carried at their marches\\".  Aurat Azadi March Quetta  2020 Aurat Azadi March in Quetta Balochistan began from and returned to the Quetta press club, was organized by the Women's Alliance.Along with rest of social discrimination issues, end of previous year i.e. 2019 was noted with exposing of security establishment and University administration officials of Balochistan University had secretly installed cameras in washrooms and student meeting areas and blackmailing students for years together. Women's Day Songs Women dance to Laal Meri at the Aurat March, Karachi As preparation of upcoming 8 March 2020 Aurat March, released and subsequently performed at the march a song 'tum ho rapist' an Urdu version of the feminist anthem 'Un Violador en Tu Camino' ‚Äî or 'A Rapist in Your Path'. While 'A Rapist in Your Path' is based on Argentinian anthropologist Rita Segato's work and created by Valparaiso feminist collective, Las Tesis, Chile; Urdu version has been localized with relevant issues of Pakistan by mentioning feudalism as part of the Pakistani patriarchy Aurat March also released & sung one more anthem song \\"Hum Inquilab Hain\\" (We are Revolution) Song \\"Hum Inquilab Hain\\" is written by Ismat Shahjahan, composed by Ammar Rashid song is sung in chorus by Areej Hussain, Ammar Rashid, Huda Bhurgri, Ismat Shahjahan, Ayesha Khan, and Shahzadi Hussain. A Canadian-Pakistani singer Sophia Jamil (pseudonym:Fifi) too released her song 'Mera Jism Meri Marzi' (My body My Choice) on YouTube. Criticism and Reaction Meri Zindagi Mera Haq, Meri Zindagi Mera Ikhtiyar (My life is my right and I should have the power to make decisions about my life) Hard line conservatives in Pakistan have often criticize the Aurat March, some even taking it to mainstream media while on social media alleging Pakistani feminists of encouraging unIslamic vulgarity by raising inappropriate slogans. Some even threatened participants when feminists clarified that they would rightfully own up and support pro-rights, pro-choice slogans like the Mera Jism Meri Marzi (Urdu: My body my choice). They insisted that there is nothing vulgar in asking their rights; besides it is societal duplicity in Pakistan that besides open display of sexual harassment of women, adverts of 'Mardana Kamzori' (discussing masculine sexuality) are openly displayed, sexualized abusive linguistic commonly used, online search histories of many men would show wide porn consumption, word 'Aurat' itself originally talks of women body in wide use; but when it comes to better awareness and women's rights their slogans are thought to be inappropriate. Two marchers holding placards \\"Meray Paas Mein Hoon\\" (I am with myself) and Inquilab bhi Aurat ka kaam hay (Making revolution is women's task) As pro-Aurat March hashtags trended on Twitter, including that of Mera Jism Meri Marzi (My body my choice), cultural and intellectual clashes happened in mainstream media. Online social media eventually did show off-line impact. In an analysis of opposing Twitter trends by Rizvan Saeed it emerged that #WeRejectMeraJismMeriMarzi and #HayaMarch were most likely organic few other hashtags which were trended on Twitter like #AmirLiaqat_Laanti #ÿß€å⁄©ÿ≥Ÿæÿßÿ¶ÿ±_⁄©⁄æÿ≥ÿ±€í (roughly translates into \\"expired eunuchs.\\") #ŸÅÿ≠ÿßÿ¥€å_ŸÖÿßÿ±⁄Ü_ŸÜÿßŸÖŸÜÿ∏Ÿàÿ± (Roughly translated as \\"Vulgar March Unacceptable\\") were inorganically propagated by limited number of individual groups of vested conservative interests including groups affiliated with ultra conservative Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan to trend anti-Aurat March memes. In April 2019, Jawad Naqvi a cleric, termed Aurat March Organisers ‚ÄòMost Evil Of All Women‚Äô. In the run up to 2020 march, polity in Pakistan started drawing subtle political lines either favoring or distancing from the march in various degrees. Ultra-conservatives claimed Islam is already the most feminist religion and has secured all the rights to women, so they need not have any more demands, but need to go back and adopt more of the modest culture expected of Muslim women. These people arranged counter 'Haya' (modesty) marches to stop Aurat March with the slogan \\"Our bodies, Allah's choice\\". Erstwhile Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Muslim league party (PML-N), while it did not oppose Aurat March openly, cautioned marchers not to cross Islamic cultural markers. Contemporary Prime Minister Imran Khan's government, ruled by his Pakistan Tekreek-i-Insaf (which had buckled under pressure to the ultra-conservative groups a month earlier which created violent ruckus while opposing Aurat March in Islamabad) while formally supporting march connected religio-cultural appropriateness of slogans of the march with national honor. Subsequently, after the Aurat March took place, Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed criticism of the lack of uniform education which would have educated marchers better. The left-of-center Pakistan Peoples Party was more welcoming of Aurat March. Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, the Senator representing PPP, criticized Prime Minister Imran Khan and his party to be favoring ultra- conservative and PML-N and PTI positions as an undeclared anti-women alliance. PPP were replied back opponents by pointing out lacuna on their side. Janita Tahir noted that participants of Aurat March are questioning Imran Khan while he speaks so much for human rights for minorities world over, is he doing enough for human rights of half the population of Pakistan which finds itself in weaker position? Farzana Rasheed further asks in her article that why Pakistan can't be Islamic republic & free at the same time? She further questions contradictions of Imran Khan & Pakistan's conservative polity that instigates and condones extremist violence same time claiming to be democratic and peaceful and that they do not support violence but understand sentiment behind it, as usual victim blaming non violent women's protest for the violence committed on them.  Posters and slogans 2020  thumb The 8 March 2020's slogans also included \\"Saying Mashallah does not make your harassment halal\\", \\"Domestic violence kills more than corona\\", \\"I march so one day my daughters won't have to\\", \\"IMAGINE Not Loving The Women in your Life Enough To Advocate For Their Rights\\". Supportive gents held placards like, \\"I am surrounded by the opposite gender and I feel safe. 'I want same for them'\\", \\"Proud husband of a feminist, proud father of a feminist, proud feminist\\", \\"I will be a proud 'jorru ka ghulam\\" (I will be proud, being called 'wife's slave' ‚Äì South Asian misogynist patriarchal culture frequently uses the pejorative term 'jorru ka ghulam' ‚Äì wife's slave ‚Äì to men who give an ear to their spouse).

History These 4-4-0 locomotives built from 1895 at Vulcan Foundry and named Rathdown, Rathmines, Rathnew and Rathdrum. In their initial form they were poor steamers, the suggestion being the locomotive superintendent Grierson had specified larger cylinders on a previous design for an English railway without balancing this with an increased boiler. His successor Cronin rebuilt the locomotives with Belpaire boilers resulting in improved performance. On amalgamation to Great Southern Railways in 1925 they became numbered 450 to 453 and allocated to class 450/D8. They were withdrawn between 1939 and 1940.

Stars Vin Kridakorn and Greg Engbrecht were also the short's executive producers. In 2017, Eveless received a general theatrical release through its inclusion in the Canadian science-fiction horror anthology film, Galaxy of Horrors. Plot In or not long after the year 2525, men survive, but without women. A world conglomerate called Chromocorp has taken control of human reproduction; it is no longer possible for humans to procreate independently. In a remote location, two desperate researchers have dared to resist. The first (Vin Kridakorn) prepares to conduct a radical experimental procedure on the second (Greg Engbrecht), who is, somehow, visibly in the very late stages of pregnancy. Both are very agitated, and the Caesarian section which takes place is a bloody and unpleasant experience for both surgeon and patient (who may die from the procedure). The baby is delivered safely, but joy turns to despair as, it's a boy, and not the girl they had hoped for. The newborn is tossed into a fish tank. Cast *Vin Kridakorn *Greg Engbrecht *Eric Folks (voice of radio host, uncredited) Production Background and development Vin Kridakorn's background was in music education before he decided to study acting at the New York Film Academy, where he first met Jackie C. Lin, who at the time was directing films, and for whom he auditioned. Through Lin, he met fellow student Antonio Padovan and appeared as a background character in one of Padovan's early films. Kridakorn went on to act in plays, on television, and in film, and eventually decided he would like to produce a film, and, having raised the funds for a project that fell through, went in search of another, contacting Lin. Together they looked for directors and re-connected with Padovan, who told them he had a script about \\"two guys, and one of them is having a baby.\\" The script said nothing about where or why this was happening; Kridakorn was intrigued, and found the prospect of playing one of the parts exciting, and moreover, Padovan's first horror short, Jack Attack (2013) had done very well, having been selected by more than fifty festivals and winning more than thirty awards. The story was fleshed out, and set in a future world without women. Kridakorn's job initially was to \\"bring everyone on board\\", which now included Lin; once he had recruited his co-executive producer Greg Engbrecht (who also plays opposite him in Eveless), the core team had been assembled. Kridakorn initially had misgivings about the film's brevity, but Padovan insisted that it had to be \\"tight\\" so they could focus on making a quality film on a limited budget. Casting and filming Kridakorn and Engbrecht were originally cast with the opposite parts they play in the finished film; after a number of rehearsals, Padovan insisted that they switch roles. Principal photography took place over two days, in New York City, like most of Padovan's other films, usually in the West Village where he has resided since leaving his native Italy in 2007. Editor Greg Zappile generously worked at a lower rate of pay than he normally would have, and had to devote time in addition to his full-time job in order to do it, so the editing took a lot of time. Release Eveless had its premiere at the Fantasia International Film Festival in Montr√©al on July 16, 2016, and played in its native US at such film festivals as Shriekfest, HollyShorts, the Chicago Horror Film Festival, and the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival. Anthology film Eveless is included in the 2017 Canadian science-fiction horror anthology film Galaxy of Horrors, which comprises eight shorts within a larger narrative frame in which a man awakens from a cryogenic sleep pod and is forced to watch the shorts as entertainment while his damaged life-support runs out. The anthology film had its premiere in Toronto at Imagine Cinemas Carlton on March 1, 2017. the feature was conceived by Little Terrors short films festival founder Justin McConnell, who directed the narrative frame, and Indiecan Entertainment's Avi Federgreen. The production is the second collaboration between Rue Morgue Cinema and Little Terrors, following Minutes Past Midnight. Home media and streaming Eveless is currently available for viewing in its entirety on YouTube. The Galaxy of Horrors anthology was released on DVD and special edition Blu-ray in 2017. The anthology was made available through various video on demand options on the IndieCan Entertainment website, on March 7, 2017, and on Amazon Prime. Reception Critical response Critics have generally responded positively to Eveless, appreciating its minimalist dystopian setting, gritty look and visceral content. Alexandra Heller-Nicholas calls the short film \\"confident\\" and minimalist, stating it \\"packs an unforgettable punch\\", describing it as a \\"gritty, grotty dystopian nightmare world\\" in which the two men \\"battle against nature\\" in a struggle \\"to keep civilisation going on their own.\\" Chris Evangelista says the film \\"is suitably unpleasant ‚Äî you can practically feel the dirt forming under your fingernails as you watch this thing.\\" Joe Bendel compares the short to Joan Rivers' Rabbit Test, \\"except more apocalyptic and dystopian.\\" He also suggests it would be well paired with Pablo Gonz√°lez's Cord: > because both present dark but decidedly non-sterile visions of the future. > In this case, the confined, claustrophobic setting is literally overflowing > with intriguingly detailed yet vaguely disturbing props and trappings, > representing quite a triumph from production designer Roxy Martinez. The > nervous energy of its two-handed cast of Vin Kridakorn and Greg Engbrecht > aptly completes the unsettling and unbalanced picture. At a mere seven > minutes, Eveless is quite a distinctive piece of world-building. Reviewing the film as part of the Galaxy of Horrors anthology, Carl Fisher calls it \\"visceral\\" and suggests \\"the grittiness of the environment & excellent performances really sell it\\", along with \\"believable characters & acting\\". Jay Seaver, who enjoys \\"gross-out\\" films, gives the short 3 stars out of 4: \\"it sketches out an outlandish premise, serves up a fair amount of stuff that's not for the squeamish, and has a sense of its own absurdity.\\" Jay Clarke was impressed by the film's intimacy and ambition in creating a substantial world in a short period of time. Richard Sopko says that Eveless relies solely on the unexpected and shock, calling it \\"a crude and juvenile short that thinks it's being edgy but comes off as laughable.\\" Audience response Being close to the film themselves, the filmmakers were not sure about the result until they started to see audiences \\"squirming\\" in response to it, enjoying it and asking questions about it.

The style of the 'Sciura' has influenced the fashion industry and is continued to do so. ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô (pronounced /Àà ÉuÀêra/) is the feminine word for sciur, which is the Lombard dialect for signora and signor. The word ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô in itself can be translated directly in to lady, but the essence to the dialect word has a larger meaning. ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô has become strongly connoted to a certain lifestyle, look and attitude. What separates the ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô from other trends and styles is that the style in itself is not merely, or maybe not at all, defined by the physical features. The essence of the style can be described as an attitude, accompanied by certain aesthetic sets of features.  Characteristic features  In an objective attempt to distinct and define the characteristic esthetical features, the 'Sciura' is elegant and refined, but with an attitude. She is elderly, wealthy and living in the city center of Milan. She is wearing timeless high fashion designed clothing; often furs, big sunglasses, pearl necklaces accompanied with permed hair. A transpiration of a style is to be seen in the high-end areas of Milan, strolling the streets, having an espresso, going to the theatre or shopping.  Sciura and class  The origins of ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô is rooted in the old aristocratic society of Milan. The connection between the essence of 'Sciura' and the upper class hierarchical system is undeniable. Consumption as a way of displaying and defining your social relations and identity has been a crucial point in the theory of the Consumer Culture. As ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô taste has become synonymous with luxury, the display of this certain style has therefore become an activity in which one displays wealth and upper class. This act of using commodities as a form of visibly expressing ones wealth is what the American sociologist Thorstein Veblen called conspicuous consumption, and has become an essential part of the ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô way of living and how to portray one's own personal brand.  Sciura, snob effect and manifestation in media  'Sciura' has been found in fashion, Films, Theatres, literature and in television for over a decade. The fashion world especially adopted the classical features of the ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô and from a 60-year-old Isabella Rossellini starring in the Bulgari advertisement in 2012 to Lauren Hutton closing the Bottega Veneta show together with Gigi Hadid in 2017, the fashion world the fashion world is adopting more and more to the dressing codes of the elders. The ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô prefers exclusive, unusual and unique goods, which is called showing a snob appeal. How they are dressing is a way to communicate the status in a silent but effective way, where a high price also means high quality. The goods often have high value, but low practical value and the rarer the item is, the higher the snob value will be. They are influencing our contemporary society with the so called snob effect which is making the ‚ÄòSciurastyle' grow and can therefore be seen many brands at the moment. Brands like Balenciaga, Marc Jacobs, Prada and Gucci bring back it's classic cuts and embraces the snob appeal.  Sciura as influencer  ‚ÄòSciuras‚Äô appearance in social media is increasing rapidly. Through the Instagram profile Sciuraglam the ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô has become famous to the wider public. The Instagram account with has over 150 K followers (March 2019) is a dedication to these elderly fashionistas that quickly became a phenomenon. The account captures real life Street Style photographs of the Sciura's moments of everyday life in the city of Milan. There is a presence of humor and sarcasm in the Instagram account, although it is strongly implied that the ‚ÄòSciura‚Äô is to be adored and iconized. A stereotypical post in Sciuraglam would be a photograph of a lady who will do grocery shopping in her Chanel suit or taking the tram with her Herm√®s Birkin bag in hand. The pictures that are seen on Sciuraglam are pictures both taken by the owner of the Instagram account but also pictures sent by the Sciura's themselves, honored and eager to be featured on the page.  Sciura in real life  Cecilia Matteucci Lavarini is a \\"Sciura-character\\" that often features in the Instagram account Sciuraglam. In her own Instagram account she describes herself as a \\"Haute Couture and Oriental Costume Collector. Enthusiastic supporter of concert, opera and ballet..\\".  Sciura in different cultures  Outside Milan there is influencers or fashion icons that can be seen as cross cultural 'Sciura's'. In New York, Iris Apfel, Helen Van Winkle aka Baddiewinkle or even Anna Wintour can be categorized as a 'Sciura' when looking at their attributes such as style, social class and habit. These are fashion icons that have reached millions of followers on Instagram thanks to their daring style and personality.

Lapp (n√©e Renn, 1930) is an American archaeologist and biblical scholar who has worked on a number of sites in Jordan and Palestine, alongside her husband, Paul Lapp. After her husband's untimely death in 1970, she dedicated herself to publishing all of their excavation reports, an immense task which is still ongoing. Lapp became curator of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology in 1970, and in 2000 became Curator Emerita. She also currently serves as a Trustee Emerita of the American Center of Oriental Research (ACOR) in Amman, Jordan, to whom she has donated an expansive collection of photographs documenting her and Paul's travels and archaeological expeditions. Lapp has a bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati and a master's degree from McCormick Theological Seminary. At the encouragement of her professors, G. Ernest Wright and Frank Moore Cross, she became secretary and the first female research assistant to Dr. William F. Albright at Johns Hopkins University between 1955 and 1957. It was during this time that she met and married Paul Lapp. In 1957, Nancy and Paul joined the Drew-McCormick Archaeological Expedition to Shechem, where they received training in excavation technique and ceramic typology from G. Ernest Wright, Lawrence Toombs, and Ovid Sellers. Nancy and Paul \\"soon came to be recognized as a very promising team of biblical archaeologists.\\" From 1960-1965, Paul was director of the American School of Oriental Research (ASOR) in Jerusalem (today the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research). Lapp was heavily involved with keeping the Institute running smoothly, as well as assisting with the numerous excavations Paul initiated during this time, all while raising their five children. After Paul stepped down as director in 1965, the Lapps continued to live and work from ASOR, and Paul began work at the Early Bronze Age site of Bab edh-Dhra. This project later expanded into the Expedition to the Dead Sea Plain project (EDSP), excavations which Lapp continued to assist on from 1970 through their final season in 1990. In 1970, Lapp began working at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary (PTS) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She lectured and worked as Curator of the university's Kelso Bible Lands Museum (now renamed the Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology). In 2000, Lapp retired and became Curator Emerita of the museum but did not stop her publication work, receiving funding from various grants and fellowships. After Paul died in a tragic swimming accident in 1970 with nearly all of his excavations unpublished, Lapp resolved to publish them herself. Among the many archaeological sites that Paul Lapp had worked on are \\"Iraq al-Amir [near Wadi as-Seer], Tell er-Rumeith [near Irbid], Bab edh-Dhra [near the Dead Sea], and Tell Taanach/Ta‚Äôanak [near Jenin, Palestine].\\" As of June 2019, she has largely completed this endeavor.Lapp, Nancy.

She has published three books: Ngulsi (2012), Biyaare (2015) and Mayimbo (2019); the later receiving the International Justo Bolekia Bolek√° Prize for African Literature in 2019.  Biography  √Ångela Nzambi was born in Lia, a suburb of Bata in Equatorial Guinea. She studied at Carlos Lwnga High School in Bata and Rey Malabo High School in Malabo. She started her higher education at the National School of Agriculture (ENA) in Malabo, and then moved to the University of Valencia to study Business Science. Subsequently, she spent time in Houston at the University of St. Thomas for a course entitled ‚ÄúLiteracy Initiative for Today‚Äù. She currently works as manager of volunteering and impact for the NGO (CEAR). She is also a member of the Citizen Council of the Valencian branch of the Podemos political party.  Writings  Nzambi published her first book, Ngulsi, in 2012. Her narrative in this work is taken from the oral tradition. It is based on the reinterpretation of some stories, which came partly from her education in Equatorial Guinea and were told by the \\"karichobo\\" (matrilineal kin) of her ethnic group, the Bisao. Afterward, she participated in two collective literary works: Navidad dulce, Navidad (Nativity, Sweet Nativity, 2012) and 23 Relatos sin Fronteras (23 Stories without Borders, 2015). Her second book, Biyaare (Stars) was published in 2015. Taking an essay style, mixed with a characteristic narrative style inspired by the oral tradition, Nzambi reflects on people who \\"shone like stars,\\" that had encouraged her during her professional activity as a cultural activist. Her third book, Mayimbo (Wanderings) won the International Justo Bolekia Bolek√° Prize for African Literature in 2019. It blurs the lines between past and present, Africa and Spain, and takes as a background the inner world of a citizen of both countries.  Activism  Nzambi is an advocate of racialised feminism - the recognition of equal rights within feminism from the perspective of a black woman, in the face of the \\"double stigma\\" of being both a woman and a black person. Nzambi has campaigned actively on migrant issues in Spain. She has also participated in several Conferences, noticing: ‚ÄúIII Foro Mundial de Migraciones, organized by CEAR ‚Äìthe Spanish NGO for help for Refugees‚Äì in Madrid; and ‚ÄúAfrica y los pueblos de ascendencia africana: problematicas actuals y acciones para el future‚Äù, organized by Howard University, in Washington DC.

The picture shows two children pumping water by hand. This was the sole water supply in this section of Wilder, Tennessee in 1942) Change and continuity is a classic dichotomy within the fields of history, historical sociology, and the social sciences more broadly. The dichotomy is used to discuss and evaluate the extent to which a historical development or event represents a decisive historical change or whether a situation remains largely unchanged. The question of change and continuity is considered a classic discussion in the study of historical developments.J√∏rn Henrik Petersen og Klaus Petersen. \\"Pr√¶sentation: Dansk velf√¶rdshistorie.\\" Historisk Tidsskrift (Denmark), bind 110, h√¶fte 1, s. 217. A good example of this discussion is the question of how much the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 represents an important change in European history. In a similar vein, historian Richard Kirkendall questioned whether FDR's New Deal represented \\"a radical innovation or a continuation of earlier themes in American life?\\" and posed the question of whether \\"historical interpretations of the New Deal [should] stress change or emphasize continuity?\\"Richard Kirkendall. \\"The New Deal As Watershed: The Recent Literature.\\" The Journal of American History Vol. 54, No. 4 (1968), pp. 839. The dichotomy lends itself to constructing and evaluating historical periodizations. In terms of creating and discussing periodizations (e.g. the Enlightenment or the Victorian Era), the dichotomy can be used to assess when a period can be said to start and end, thus making the dichotomy important in relation to understanding historical chronology. Economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron argues that continuity \\"appears to mean no more than absence of change, i.e. stability.\\"Alexander Gerschenkron. \\"On the Concept of Continuity in History.\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society Vol. 106, No. 3 (Jun. 29, 1962), pp. 195‚Äì209.

History The parish church, built on Abban Street in 1903, was a rebuilding of the mission chapel of the Holy Spirit (Alexander Ross, 1886) which had stood in Factory Street, on the opposite side (east) of the River Ness. In the rebuilding, the church was lengthened. The architects were Ross and Macbeth, who were based in the city. However, extensive alterations were made to the church under the direction of Ninian Comper in 1904, 1905, 1923, 1924 and 1928, and the church has been called the \\"Comper Jewel in the Highlands of Scotland\\". The church is a simple late-Gothic, three-bay aisleless nave, narthex and chancel, with vestry at north-east, Lady Chapel at north-west, and porch at west gable. It is built of snecked masonry, with a slate roof. There is a spired bellcote at the west end. Inside, there is a collar-braced waggon roof. The Lady Chapel and furnishings were by Comper whose father Reverend John Comper had served as an Episcopal priest in Inverness. The riddel posts with tester above the high altar; stone font with spired and crocketted timber cover; and stained-glass windows are all by Comper. The church stands in the Anglo-Catholic tradition and is a member of Forward in Faith.

He also published 2 small Burgos periodicals, continuously donated money and supported various charity schemes, strove to build rural trade unions which unite landholders and farmers, and was involved in numerous Catholic initiatives usually related to the Burgos archbishopric office.

The cardinal sent an enthusiastic radio message to Primo, Pablos Papanikas 2012, p. 187 Est√©vanez is only known to have contributed to general patriotic initiatives of the regime.e.g. in 1926 he contributed financially to monument of Cervantes in Madrid, an initiative of gobierno civil, Diario de Burgos 11.11.26, available here He kept advocating Christian syndicalist solidarity when publishing El Defensor de los LabradoresDiario de Burgos 10.09.25, available here and it is likely that at one point in the late 1920s he regained control over El Castellano.in 1931 he was reported as owner of El Castellano, Mundo Gr√°fico 11.11.31, available here Apart from his agrarian economy he obtained a license for operating bus connection between Burgos and Aguilar del Camp√≥oat least since 1928, Diario de Burgos 03.04.28, available here, see also Diario de Burgos 02.12.29, available here and to handle post services on the route.Diario de Burgos 12.11.29, available here Last but not least, Est√©vanez was active building up a network of Catholic agrarian syndicates, according to himself striving to build ‚Äúclase social agro-pecuaria organizada‚Äù in the province.El Siglo Futuro 15.06.31, available here Late Integrist projects cardenal Segura In the spring of 1930, shortly after the fall of Primo de Rivera, Est√©vanez assumed a more active political stance. In line with recommendations of the primate Pedro Segura (whom he knew from Segura's Burgos archbishopric term of 1926-1927)in the late 1930s Est√©vanez was referred to as Segura‚Äôs ‚Äúviejo conocido‚Äù, Santiago Mart√≠nez S√°nchez, El Cardenal Pedro Segura y S√°enz (1880-1957) [Phd thesis Universidad de Navarra], Pamplona 2002, p. 321 and in co-operation with the Burgos archbishop Manuel de Castro he tried to mount a grand Catholic provincial political organization, ‚Äúuni√≥n habitual fuera de partidos y a los fines unicamente de la Religi√≥n y de la Patria‚Äù.Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 155. The person in question, in main text referred to as ‚ÄúFrancisco Est√©vanez‚Äù (‚Äúun integrista, presidente de la Federaci√≥n de Sindicatos Cat√≥licos de Burgos‚Äù) is further identified in footnotes and on basis of original document in the Segura archive as ‚ÄúFrancisco Est√©vanez Calder√≥n‚Äù, which remains puzzling Nothing came out of these schemes; also their scaled-down version, a temporary general alliance possibly centered around the Integrist nucleus failed to materialize.‚Äúsi esto no fuera posible, entonces puede y debe recurrirse a la uni√≥n transe√∫nte‚Äù, Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 155 In late 1930 and early 1931 he seemed already focused merely on reconstruction of the Integrist structures, e.g. lobbying with Segura about clerical subscriptions to El Siglo Futuro,Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 166 and on general Catholic propaganda.in March 1931 Est√©vanez took part in a conference in Palencia, where he delivered a lecture ‚ÄúSanto Tom√°s y los estudiantes cat√≥licos‚Äù, El D√≠a de Palencia 07.03.31, available here During the first republican campaign to the Cortes of June 1931 the Burgos Integrists joined forces with Partido Agrario; it seems that Est√©vanez personally negotiated the provincial alliance with leader of the Agrarians, Jos√© Martinez de Velasco.Diario de Burgos 20.06.31, available here The result was a common list known as ‚ÄúCandidatura Cat√≥lico-Agraria‚Äù, by some scholars referred to as ‚Äúen realidad tradicionalista‚Äù.Luis Te√≥filo Gil Cuadrado, El Partido Agrario Espa√±ol (1934-1936); un alternativa conservadora y republicana [PhD thesis Universidad Complutense], Madrid 2006, p. 113, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 126 Both Est√©vanez‚Äô periodicals, El Castellanoit seems that he re-possessed El Castellano some time between 1925 and 1931, as he was referred to as its owner during the 1931 elections, see El Defens√≥r de C√≥rdoba 30.06.31, available here, Diario de Burgos 02.06.31, available here, Rafael Iba√±ez Hern√°ndez, La familia cat√≥lica obrera durante la Segunda Rep√∫blica: el C√≠rculo Cat√≥lico de Obreros de Burgos, [in:] Espacio, Tiempo y Forma 10 (1997), p. 182 and El Defens√≥r de Labradores,though unnamed, it is probably El Castellano and El Defensor referred by a historian who noted that Est√©vanez ‚Äúowned two small local newspapers‚Äù, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 57 staged a propaganda campaign on his behalf.some scholars give Est√©vanez as a sample of a peculiar phenomenon, which consisted of a large contingent of press-related individuals (owners, publishers, journalists) winning parliamentary seats; following lawyers and academics they were the 3rd largest professional group in the Cortes, which prompted some historians to coin the name ‚Äúrepublica de periodistas‚Äù, see Antonio Checa Godoy, Prensa y partidos pol√≠ticos durante la II Rep√∫blica, Salamanca 1989, , p. 17 His former record in charityEst√©vanez claimed having donated huge sums to Sindicatos Cat√≥licos, provided free law consultations and dedicated time and money to the poor, Diario de Burgos 01.08.31, available here and in agrarian syndicates‚Äúno es necesario presentarle a los labradores.

Environmental racism  President Barack Obama sips filtered water from Flint following a round table on the Flint water crisis at Northwestern High School The relationship between environmental racism and environmental inequality is recognized throughout the developed and developing world. An example of global environmental racism is the process in which the locations of hazardous waste facilities are higher in vulnerable communities compared to that of other areas. This is most commonly seen in the USA as the environmental racism gap is very prevalent in many states across the country. Environmental racism raises ethical issues but can also have implications for a state's laws and constitution, for example the ‚Äúclean air act‚Äù, ‚Äúthe fourteenth amendment‚Äù and the ‚Äúcivil rights act‚Äù. An example of a case of environmental racism is a small mainly African American (90%) town called Uniontown located in Alabama where there is a toxic landfill which is believed to have caused serious health issues in the area. Concerns include things such as mental health issues, a one-in-five chance of developing cancer and deficiencies in reproduction due to the toxins such as mercury and arsenic contained within the ash. The toxic landfill is used to dump millions of tons of coal ash which comes from mainly white wealthier areas. Uniontown is not an isolated case as it can be seen there are many examples across the states such as Flint Michigan who are dealing with a major water crisis, West Dallas Texas where African American housing projects have been set up twenty paces from a battery recycling smelter, and Chester Pennsylvania which has become an attraction for toxic waste sites. In California the government also decided to allow pollution in vulnerable communities. The effect of environmental racism is seen in the health data which shows that African Americans are three times more likely to die from asthma. Three out of five African Americans live in a community with a least one toxic waste site. On average it takes twenty percent longer for toxic sites in minority community towns to be placed on the national priority list than white areas. Environmental racism is not only seen in the developed world but it is also prevalent in the developing world. Much hazardous waste in Africa is not actually produced there but rather was exported by developed countries such as the U.S; even though much of this exportation of waste took place in the 1980s Africa is still left with the problem of toxic waste sites to this day.  Income inequality  Environmental Kuznets curve showing an increase in environmental damage during industrial development followed by a decrease. The relationship between economic inequality and environmental inequality plays a large roll in understanding certain reasons that account for the cause of environmental inequality. The association between income inequality and environmental inequality can be measured by the environmental Kuznets curve. This curve states that when income per capita is high, the rate of pollution in that area rises until income reaches a certain threshold, once this threshold of wealth is passed then pollution in that area begins to decrease. In the case of developing nations an increase in pollution and production of greenhouse gases occurs as that nation undergoes economic growth, therefore for developing nations to escape poverty through growth pollution must be produced. This pollution is often caused through industry and manufacturing. Once the developing nation becomes a developed nation then we begin to see a drop off in pollution as a better alternative to high pollution industry can be found to stimulate the economy. Renewable energy has been more expensive to produce and maintain than traditional energy produced by fossil fuels and has only recently become as cost efficient as fossil fuels. Since the discovery of greener energy sources only richer developed nations have been able to invest and integrate renewable energy into their power production industries. In countries such as Russia it has been found that in areas where income was higher that there was an increase in uncontrolled air pollution. However while income may have been higher in these regions a greater disparity in income inequality was found. It was discovered that \\"greater income inequality within a region is associated with more pollution, implying that it is not only the level of income that matters but also its distribution\\". In Russia areas lacking in hospital beds suffer from greater air pollution than areas with higher numbers of beds per capita which implies that the poor or inadequate distribution of public services also may add to the environmental inequality of that region. Another consequence of income inequality's association with environmental inequality is the environmental privilege of consumers in developed countries, \\"consumers of goods and services that are produced by polluting industries [who] often are spatially and socially separated from the people who bear the impacts of the pollution\\". Those who are working in the production of consumer goods suffer a disproportionate amount the consequences of environmental deterioration that their more affluent consumer counterparts.  Inequality in the United States  In the United States it was also found that income inequality greatly affected the quality of the environment in which people live. People of colour and the poor in America on average experience much lower quality environments then white people or the wealthy. Action was taken in the early 1990s by the American Government in an attempt to improve environmental quality for poorer regions. In 1992 the United States Environmental Protection Agency set up the Office of Environmental Equity, now known as the Office of Environmental Justice, to address the situation at hand. However the Office of Environmental Justice's work was undermined by Congress who refused to pass the bills which were presented to them by the EPA. Instead states began to pass their own bills which did very little to improve environmental quality for poorer areas. As a result, there has been little to no change in the ratios of environmental inequality whereas there has been a decline in the ratios of race and poverty.  Environmental change in developing countries  River Ganges with pollution on the bank Global environmental inequality is primarily seen in developing countries. In recent years we have seen a change in China's production industry in relation from the movement from the primary sector of production moving into the secondary sector. China's urbanization has caused a rise in the production of factories. In China factories create harmful waste such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide which cause health risk. Journalist and science writer Fred Pearce notes that in China \\"most monitoring of urban air still concentrates on one or at most two pollutants, sometimes particulates, sometimes nitrogen oxides or sulfur dioxides or ozone. Similarly, most medical studies of the impacts of these toxins look for links between single pollutants and suspected health effects such as respiratory disease and cardiovascular conditions.\\"How a ‚ÄòToxic Cocktail‚Äô Is Posing a Troubling Health Risk in China‚Äôs Cities by Fred Pearce https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-a-toxic-cocktail-is-posing-a- troubling-health-risk-in-chinese-cities The country emits about a third of all the human-made sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulates that are poured into the air around the world. The Global Burden of Disease Study, an international collaboration, estimates that 1.1 million Chinese die from the effects of this air pollution each year, roughly a third of the global death toll.\\"How a ‚ÄòToxic Cocktail‚Äô Is Posing a Troubling Health Risk in China‚Äôs Cities by Fred Pearce https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-a- toxic-cocktail-is-posing-a-troubling-health-risk-in-chinese-cities The economic cost of deaths due to air pollution is estimated at 267 billion yuan (US$38 billion) per year. Air pollution is killing 1 million people and costing Chinese economy 267 billion yuan a year, research from CUHK shows Two pollutants were found to cause an average 1.1 million premature deaths in the country each year and are destroying 20 million tonnes of rice, wheat, maize and soybean by Ernest Kao Published: 8:00am, 2 Oct, 2018  Climate change and environmental inequality  The main issue faced by developed countries in the western world is climate change. Climate change and its effects are being escalated due to the actions of many developed countries. The use of fossil fuels has resulted in an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 33% in the past 150 years. However, the effects of climate change will be worse in areas with less food security. Due to the changes in temperature and precipitation, combined with the increase in levels of greenhouse gases emitted, it is becoming more and more difficult to produce sustainable crops. This dangerous combination leads to constant fluctuating levels of trade. The main causes of short-term fluctuations in food production are natural disasters, such as drought and floods. When climate fluctuations become more prevalent and widespread, extreme natural events will become more severe and more frequent. With the demand for food expected to increase by 50% by 2030 alongside a growing population, food security is becoming vital. In temperate latitudes, higher temperatures are expected to benefit agriculture, as the areas that are potentially suitable for cropping will expand, and the length of the growing period will also increase. However, with the rise in temperature, comes a rise in extreme events, such as heatwaves which may lead to drought. For example, in the summer of 2018, Ireland experienced the hottest summer on record since 1976. This heatwave lead to a 53 day period of \\"absolute drought conditions\\", and as a result, there was an increase in crop failures. The increase in frequency of these extreme events affect the stability of food supplies and thus food security. When food supplies get damaged by weather, access to food also becomes damaged. When developing countries are faced with extreme events, and certain crops can no longer be produced due to sustainability, the access to certain foods, such as cereals and exotic fruits, become unavailable to the people living in developed countries. The areas that will be mostly affected by crop failure are found in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia. This means that the regions that will be exposed to the highest degree of instability in food production are the poorest regions in developing countries. Climate change will affect all dimensions of food security, in particular food availability, access to food, and stability of food supplies. The overall impact of climate change on food security will affect both developing countries and developed countries, however, the effects will be felt differently across regions and over different periods of time.

It houses the historical collections of St. Patrick‚Äôs College, Maynooth, which was established in 1795. The Russell Library is home to significant collections, manuscripts, and archival holdings, notably the Salamanca archive documents which date back to 1751. There is also a collection of incunabula (pre-1501 printing) such as a 1482 volume set on moveable type and an illuminated collection of medieval and Gaelic manuscripts. There are over 2,500 bibles, which includes the 493 long bibles also. The Russell Library was the main library in Maynooth until the opening of the John Paul II Library in 1981 which is now the main library for both students of Maynooth University and St. Patrick's College. Access to the Russell Library is by appointment only. However, during the summer the library holds exhibitions which are open to the public. The exhibitions typically last from the end of June to the end of July. History The Russell library, named after former president and professor at Maynooth College, Charles William Russell, was completed in 1861, taking sixteen years to construct in total. The library was designed by renowned British architect Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-1852), who did not live to see its completion. Work on the library began in 1845 when the grant received by the college increased dramatically. The President at the time, Lawrence Renehan decided to renovate and expand the colleges library facilities, and opted for the reputed talents of Pugin to realize his vision. The final design included popular contemporary features such as high Gothic windows and an open timbered roof. The library initially served St. Patrick's College Maynooth, a seminary for the education of priests, founded in 1795. The entrance hall of the library contains a large stone statue of King George III, a tribute to the man who approved the establishment of St. Patrick's college and the library within, in 1795. The Russell library houses the historical collections of St. Patrick's College, and also the archives of the Irish college in Salamanca. These archives, numbering some fifty thousand documents dating from the foundation of the college in 1592, were relocated to Maynooth college in 1951, following the closure of the Irish college.The medieval manuscripts at Maynooth/ by Peter J. Lucas and Angela M.Lucas Maynooth University hosted an exhibition at the Russell library on April 18th 2018 to commemorate the centenary of a protest against compulsory conscription during the second world war.Hennessy, Dave. \\"The Hay Plan & Conscription in Ireland During WW1\\". Waterford County Museum. Retrieved 28 March 2019 The library, today, serves as a research library for Maynooth University. Math collection The math collection of the library holds many rare collections and older printed books. There is information available about items in the collection from the early 19th century and their substantial connection with the teaching of mathematics. Ciaran Mac an Bhaird, A Guide to the Mathematics Collection in the Russell Library (College Collection) In the mathematics collection there is an example of Andr√© Darr√©‚Äôs Elements of Geometry with both Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (Dublin, 1813). Darr√© produced the book to help reform the study of mathematics in the college at that time. The Salamanca archive From the mid-16th century, due to the anti catholic legislation that restricted the education of Catholics in Ireland, young Irishmen with academic aspirations traveled to continental Europe to begin their education.Gary Mooney, \\"The Irish student diaspora in the sixteenth century and the early years of the Irish college at Salamanca\\", British Catholic History, 14(3), pp. 242-260. The Catholics relief acts of 1782 and 1793 finally allowed Catholics to be educated in Ireland, ending the immediate need for Irish colleges abroad. The first Irish college on the continent was established in Paris in 1578, followed by the first Irish college in Salamanca, Spain, in 1592.Denis o Doherty, Students of the Irish colleg Salamanca(1595-1619). Archivium Hibernicum, 2, 1-36. The Irish college at Salamanca was founded by Rev. Thomas White from Tipperary, Ireland, by royal decree of King Phillip the second, who also provided initial financial support for the students who attended the college.William Hickling Prescott, History of the reign of King Philip the second, King of Spain, vol.1, R.Bentley. The students resided at the college whilst attending lectures at the University of Salamanca. In 1608 the Irish college was incorporated into the University of Salamanca, and was subsequently administered by the Society of Jesus until their expulsion from Spain in 1767 by King Charles III.Magnus Morner,The expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain and Spanish America in 1767 in light of eighteenth century regalism, The Americas 23(2), pp156-164. The Irish college at Salamanca was closed between 1807 and 1838, due to the peninsula war, and again in 1936 due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Many records were lost due to damage caused by conflict, and by looting. Those records that did escape undamaged were sent to St. Patrick's College Maynooth when, in 1952, after over 360 years, the Irish College at Salamanca closed its doors for the final time. The documents rescued include over fifty thousand administrative records, dating as far back as the mid 1500s. They also include some documents from Irish colleges at Lisbon, Valladolid, Seville, Madrid, Alcala de Henares, and Santiago de Compostela. At their height, Irish colleges on the continent numbered 480 students, across twelve locations, most of whom were based in France or the Austrian Netherlands. The catholic relief acts ended the need for foreign education, and led to the establishment of Maynooth college, and the archives were sent here in recognition of the historical links between the need for home based education and the establishment of the college. Pamphlets The collection of pamphlets stored in the Russell Library is approximately 12,000 in number showcasing all topics dating from approximately the 18th and 19th centuries made of Irish Language and Catholic Truth Society pamphlets. They display a large range of controversial yet topical issues: political satire, writers reacting to government policy, parliamentary speeches, charity sermons, comic operas, associations for developing as a society, developments in agriculture, inventions, military expedition accounts, medical theories, art exhibitions and finally court cases.

Her main merit was writing a commentary on ibn Arabi's Mashahid. Her full name is Sitt al-Ajam bint al-Nafis b. Abu l-Qasim.Ibn 'Arabi. Contemplation of the Holy Mysteries. C. Twinch and P. Beneito, transl. Oxford: Anqa Publishing, p. 12 Coincidence with name In the history of female Muslim scholars two women are to be found bearing the same name. Fatima Mernissi argues that the Arabic term sitt literally means 'lady' and has been often attributed to women of power. However, with some exceptions, she listed three names beginning with sitt: one is Sitt al-Ajam not connected with the issue of politics at all. According to her, Sitt al-'Ajam is a fiqh scholar who lived in the 14th-century in Damascus.Mernissi, F. (1993). The Forgotten Queens of Islam. Polity Press: UK, pp.19-20 The name can be confused with Sitt al-'Ajam bint al-Nafis (the subject of this article), a 13th-century Sufi woman whose thoughts on ibn Al- Arabi were transmitted by her husband.Saeyyd, A. (2013). Women and the Transmission of Religious Knowledge in Islam. Cambridge University Press, p.193 Sitt al-'Ajam confessed in her book that she had a vision of ibn Al- Arabi who came to her and asked her to write a commentary on his book MashƒÅhid al-asrƒÅr al-qudsiyya wa matƒÅli' al-anwƒÅr al-ilƒÅhiyya (The Witnessing of the Holy Mysteries and the Rising of the Divine Lights). She explained in her words: \\"I closely examined his name and his biography, for a way to draw from him the definition [for my state], but I found that the similarity between us is in receiving the very same \\"hƒÅtimƒ´ gifts\\", that leads to attraction (jadhb). This, despite not having the same state of distinction, nor following the same path, nor having the same life; [the] similarity is [only] that of character and of [divine] bestowal, which is the privilege of the saints (awliyƒÅ'). Thus, his luminous form could not but be witness to the knowledge of union that exists between us.\\"http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/sitt- ajam.html. The term ajam The term ajam is Arabic and denotes one who is not of Arabic origin and whose native language is not Arabic. Mostly it referred to Persians. After the conquest of Persia by the Arabs the term took on pejorative connotations. It could be met as a surname.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajam In the case of Sitt al-Ajam it pinpoints that her ancestors were not Arab in origin. Commentary on ibn Arabi's Mashahid Sitt al-'Ajam's commentary is of impressive size and runs to about three hundred pages. She managed to write two more books on mysterious themes: Kashf al-kun≈´z (Unveiling the Treasures) and KitƒÅb al-Khatm (The Book of the Seal). Michel Chodkiewicz in An Ocean Without Shore: Ibn Arabi, the Book, and the Law called her commentary 'very beautiful' and that it was inspired by a purely imaginary vision of ibn-'Arabi and conversing with him in front of the gathering of the prophets. He underlines that she intentionally did not aim to explain such parts of hermeneutic analysis of the text as, for instance, the structure of the text.Chodkiewicz, M.

New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services This compound can be classified in the group of benzyl halides and has a molecular weight of 175.052 g/mol. This compound has a boiling point of 250‚Äì255 ¬∞C and a melting point of 34‚Äì37 ¬∞C. Xylylene dichloride is used as a vulcanizing agent to harden rubbers. It catalyzes the crosslinking of phenolic resins.  Structure and reactivity  The structure of xylylene dichloride is characterized by an benzene ring with two chloromethyl groups and four hydrogen atoms bound to it. The chloromethyl groups can be located on different sites on the ring, leading to a few different possible forms. These forms are: *o-xylylene dichloride: 1,2-bis(chloromethyl)benzene *m-xylylene dichloride: 1,3-bis(chloromethyl)benzene *p-xylylene dichloride: 1,4-bis(chloromethyl)benzene The reactive groups of xylylene dichloride are the aryl halides, these are the Cl atoms that are bound to the benzene ring in the side chain. The Cl atoms replace the hydrogen atoms that would usually be located on that site in the ring. Although the aryl halides are the reactive groups, simple aromatic halogenated organic compounds are very unreactive. With every hydrogen atom that is replaced with a halogen atom, the compound becomes less reactive. This is due to the fact that materials in the halogen group react with strong oxidizers and reducers. Furthermore, they can be react with many amines, nitrides, azo/diazo compounds, alkali metals and epoxides.  Synthesis  Xylylene dichloride can be synthesized from benzenedimethanol. This is done by nucleophilic substitution of the two hydroxyl groups. This reaction occurs with 2HCl.  1, 4-bis(chloromethyl)benzene synthesis technology  Xylylene dichloride can be artificially synthesized with a Chinese invention which relates to a 1,4-bis(chloromethyl)benzene synthesis technology. In this technology, the aromatic hydrocarbon p-xylene and the chemical element chlorine react with an ionic liquid catalyst under LED light source to form a 1,4-bis(chloromethyl)benzene reaction solution. After that, the solution is cooled and separated, so that a crude product is obtained. 1,4-bis(chloromethyl)benzene is obtained by vacuum rectification of the crude product.\\"1, 4-bis(chloromethyl)benzene synthesis technology\\" (2015) Chinese patent N105384595A  References  Category:Organochlorides ","title":"Xylylene dichloride"},{"id":"60163526","title":"2019 Tunisian parliamentary election"},{"id":"60163540","text":"Jack Rasmussen (born 9 February 1923) was a Danish wrestler.

They were located on two opposite ends of the building, with Prince facing Beach Road, and Jade angled towards Nicoll Highway. At the time of its opening, Prince was the largest cinema hall in Singapore. In 1987, the cinemas underwent a S$12 million renovation by twinning them into four halls, a project consisting of adding a second screen into the circle seats in each cinema hall. This was followed by a seven-month renovation of the retail podium, which was renamed Shaw Leisure Gallery in 1989. In 1996, both Prince and Jade cinemas were sold to American cinema chain United Artists, in which they were renamed Grand Prince/Alhambra and Royal Jade/Emerald respectively. Both cinemas were returned to Shaw Theatres in late 2001, when Shaw bought over United Artists operations in Singapore. Jade Theatre switched to screening Hindi films in early 2006 and was subsequently renamed Screens of Bombay Talkies. It was acquired by Indian cinema chain Carnival Cinemas in early 2017. Prince Theatre ceased operations in late 2008, as their large halls could not compete with other large multiplexes and their smaller halls. It was then leased to Rock Productions, the business arm of New Creation Church in 2012, and subsequently refurbished as Shine Auditorium.  Redevelopment  In 2018, the management of Shaw Tower gave notice to tenants to vacate the building‚Äôs premises by June 2020,However, all tenants vacated the building by 31 July 2020 due to delays caused by Singapore's lockdown measures as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak earlier in April. Slated to be ready by 2023, the new 35-storey Shaw Tower is expected to contain 400,000 sq ft of Grade A office space and 30,000 sq ft of retail space. The redevelopment will be synced with that of GuocoLand‚Äôs Guoco Midtown, which will be completed by mid-2022. Upon completion, the new Shaw Tower will form an integral part of the Ophir-Rochor Corridor, a revamped, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use district centred around Bugis MRT station.  Architecture  The L-shaped floor area of Shaw Tower, with a narrow section angled towards Nicoll Highway, was due to the building being constructed upon the site of two demolished cinemas and the now-expunged Hoi How Road. Shaw Tower was designed by Singaporean architect Charles Ho of Iversen, van Sitteren & Partners. The structure is Brutalist in style, featuring a podium- block-and-tower configuration. The former was designed as a retail space, while the latter was designated for offices. The multi-storey car park spanned the 3rd to the 11th floor. This gave the commercial space on the first two floors of Shaw Tower access to the street level. The podium allowed Shaw Tower to align with the other low-rise shophouses that populated Beach Road at the time of its construction, while the high-rise tower made it a landmark in the area. Internally, there was a close integration of movement of shoppers and cinema-goers, while the circulation for offices was kept separated. The office tower was additionally designed on a fixed module, allowing flexible partitioning of the space. The tower portion of Shaw Tower is staggered into three parts, with patterned sun-shading panels made from precast concrete lining its facade.

It is in fact native to western parts of Honshu and throughout Shikoku and Kyushu, growing in mountain forests and woods from 100 to 900m. It is not at all clear why it is less popular in the west than in Japan. The Greek specific epithet brachybotrys means ‚Äúshort clusters‚Äù. Growing to or more, it is a deciduous anticlockwise twining woody climber with hairy leaves to long, each leaf comprising up to 13 leaflets. The scented flowers, borne in late spring and early summer, are pale violet or white with a yellow blotch at the base. They hang in racemes up to long. They are followed by felted green seedpods containing pea-like seeds. These are reported to be toxic if ingested in quantity. Like its more famous cousins, Wisteria sinensis (Chinese wisteria) and Wisteria floribunda (Japanese wisteria), it requires support when grown as an ornamental.

Early life Musenden's first names is also spelled Mussendin, Mussendine and Mussentine. He is reported to have been born in Belfast, County Antrim, Ireland in about 1735. His parents may have been James Matthews and Mary McGill. He immigrated from Ireland to the American colonies and appeared in Rowan County, North Carolina in 1778, the same year that Iredell County, North Carolina was created from Rowan county.

Keever Military service Matthews was a known Lieutenant in the NC State Cavalry-Western District in 1780 under Capt. John Reid. He was also referred to as \\"Major\\" Matthews. The following accounts of his Revolutionary War exploits have been found: :\\"A company of Calvalry, composed of choice men, was immediately organized. By general consent he was demanded for their leader; all his objections were overruled and to encourage his countrymen to act rather than to talk, he accepted the command. In the year 1779 he led them on an expedition into South Carolina, of several months continuance, performing a double office of Commander and Chaplain, and marched over a large part of the western section of the State.\\" :\\"During this expedition two of his men were taken prisoners. As he could not recover them by force of arms, he made their case a subject of prayer, both in private and in public, with his men. In a few days they rejoined the company, having made their escape...\\" :\\"Going one day on a reconnoitering expedition, accompanied by an Officer of the company, his friend Mathews, as they emerged from a dense forest into an open field, near to and in full view of a house, they observed some fifteen or twenty British dragoons around the house, some walking about,and some ready mounted. In a moment they observed the peril of their situation from the number of the enemy, and the position of the house and open fields; that it was as impossible to escape by flight, as reckless to make an attack on ten times their number, fully aware of their approach. They halted; Mathews drew his sword, and turning in his saddle towards the wood, waves it as if summoning a company to advance. The dragoons take the alarm, and dashing off at full speed, were soon out of sight, leaving our two officers to make good their retreat.\\" :\\"He was an expert rider and had his horse well trained to do his bidding.... Somewhere in South Carolina, probably about Seventy Six, while he was out reconnoitering he ran into the enemy and found himself in a position where his only means of escape was to cross a large creek which was not fordable except at the regular ford. Instead of making for the ford where the enemy expected to head him off, he directed his course to a foot crossing, approaching which he rode his horse across on the foot log and having safely crossed, waving his sword in defiance at the pursuing enemy who though that they had hemmed, as he rode away.\\"Statesville Sentinel, Statesville, North Carolina, February, 1915 After the war In 1786, Mussenden was given a Land Grant consisting of 274 Acres on Station Camp Creek just northeast of Nashville. This land was in Davidson County (now Sumner County), Tennessee and was given to him by the State of North Carolina for his service during the Revolutionary War.

He showed promise as two-year-old when he won a maiden race on his debut and then finished fourth in the Sirenia Stakes. In the following year he was beaten in the Pavilion Stakes and the Carnarvon Stakes before recording his biggest win in the Commonwealth Cup. In two subsequent races that year he ran poorly in the July Cup and the Haydock Sprint Cup. Background Eqtidaar is a bay horse bred in Ireland by his owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate. The colt was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by the Haydock Sprint Cup winner Invincible Spirit, who has produced many other major winners including Kingman, Charm Spirit, Mayson, Fleeting Spirit, Moonlight Cloud and Lawman. Eqtidaar's dam Madany won two of her eleven races and went on to produce the 2000 Guineas runner-up Massaat. She was a descendant of the French mare Greenback, who was the female-line ancestor of many good winners including Toulon. Racing career 2017: two-year-old season Eqtidaar made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse on 18 August and started the 6/4 favourite in an eight-runner field. Ridden by Jim Crowley he accelerated into a clear lead in the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by two and a half lengths from Mountain Guard. Dane O'Neill took the ride three weeks later when the colt was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Sirenia Stakes on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse and came home fourth behind the favoured Invincible Army. 2018: three-year-old season Eqtidaar began his second campaign in the Group 3 Pavilion Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 2 May. With O'Neill in the saddle he took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish but was overtaken by Invincible Army in the closing stages and beaten into second place. In the Listed Carnarvon Stakes at Newbury Racecourse 17 days later he was made second favourite but was never able to reach the leaders after a slow start and came home fourth behind Never Back Down. Crowley took the ride on 22 June at Royal Ascot when the colt was stepped up to Group 1 class to contest the Commonwealth Cup and started at odds of 12/1 in a 22 runner field. The Phoenix Stakes winner Sioux Nation went off favourite ahead of Invincible Army, Equilateral and Sands of Mali while the other runners included Heartache (Flying Childers Stakes), Cardsharp (July Stakes), Actress (Ballyogan Stakes) and Unfortunately (Prix Morny). Most of the runners, including Eqtidaar, raced up the centre of the straight while a smaller group of six raced up the stands-side. After racing in mid-division Eqtidaar made progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead inside the final furlong and held on well in the closing stages to win by half a length from Sands of Mali. After the race Crowley said \\"I knew Eqtidaar had potential. He'd been working fantastic at home and I knew today he had a great chance.\\" Michael Stoute commented \\"We've always liked this horse. It didn't go right for him in the Pavilion Stakes and he was on the wrong side of the track at Newbury last time. He's progressing nicely.\\" Three weeks after his win at Ascot, Eqtidaar was pitted against older sprinters for the first time in the July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse. Although he briefly looked likely to threaten the leaders he was unable to sustain his challenge and came home ninth behind U S Navy Flag. After a lengthy break the colt returned to the track in September for the Haydock Sprint Cup in which he was ridden by Danny Tudhope and started a 20/1 outsider. He never looked likely to win and finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind The Tin Man beaten eighteen lengths by the winner. 2019: four-year-old season On his first and only appearance as a four-year-old Eqtidaar contested the King Richard III Stakes at Leicester Racecourse on 27 April in which he came home fifth of the six runners behind Hey Gaman.

(2003) Elcho of the '45, Saltire Society, p.46 The French government accordingly made formation of a Scots regiment a key element of its plan for a possible campaign in Scotland, with an intention to \\"confer captaincies on those Highland chiefs known to be loyal to the House of Stuart\\". A narrative written by \\"A.M.\\" or \\"Pickle the Spy\\", a British intelligence agent now thought to have been Alastair Ruadh MacDonnell of Glengarry, claims that he was responsible for the regiment's formation when he was presented to Louis XV after Dettingen.Maclean-Bristol, Nicholas. \\"JACOBITE OFFICERS IN THE SCOTS BRIGADE IN DUTCH SERVICE\\" Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research vol 82, no. 330 (2004), 101 \\"A.M.\\" also suggested that Sir Hector Maclean was intended to be Lieutenant-Colonel, but Drummond \\"got a stop to [his] obtaining the Commission\\".Maclean-Bristol (2004), 102 An ordnance to raise the regiment was dated 3 December 1743; France declared war on Britain in March 1744, and the regiment's first commissions were issued on 1 August. In addition to those Scots already in the Irish Brigade, Jacobite recruiting parties were active in Scotland in late 1744 and into 1745.Wood, S. (1989) The Auld Alliance: Scotland and France, the Military Connection, Mainstream, p.80 Recruits were embarked at east coast ports like Montrose, where there were a number of Jacobite shipmasters. A further source of recruits was among deserters from the British Army on the Continent and the regiment eventually included men from England and Ireland in addition to those of Scottish or French origin. Later in its career its composition became even more varied; in 1749 one company included 41 Scots, 18 English, 16 Irish, 23 Germans, 15 Flemish and 33 French, as well as 24 'other'.McCorry (1996), 15 Organisation and equipment The establishment of the Regiment Royal-Ecossais was set at 12 companies, each of 55 men; one grenadier company and 11 fusilier companies. While officers in the period were still reluctant to adopt standard uniforms, the men were issued with dark blue coats of French cut and facings of orange-red \\"rouge a l'Ecossoise\\", waistcoats of the facing colour, white breeches and a laced hat. Uniforms were kept for special occasions, like battles; rough grey was usually worn for everyday use. During the 1745 rising, Jacobite service was indicated by white cockades worn in the hat: while they are sometimes said to have worn the distinctive woollen blue bonnet while in Scotland,Reid (1996), 1745: A Military History of the Last Jacobite Rising, p.90 this probably applied only to officers or to those recruits raised later in Perth. Their colours, recorded in a French document of 1748, featured a St Andrew's Cross and thistles with a fleur-de-lis and the motto Nemo me impune lacessit.McCorry (1996), 16 Service The Royal-Ecossais initially served under Saxe and are widely said to have been present at Fontenoy in May 1745, though this may refer only to elements of the unit. In late November 1745 they were embarked for Scotland. Not all units sent by the French were able to pass through the British blockade; one company (including MacDonnell of Glengarry) was captured with L'Esperance off the Dogger Bank, but Drummond and the remainder, under cover of a gale, were able to reach Montrose on 7 December. Most of the regiment was employed at Stirling in late January; constructing gun emplacements under fire caused regular casualties. In February recruitment began in Perth to raise a second battalion; this was not especially successful but the regiment was around 350 strong by the time of Culloden. At Culloden the Royal-Ecossais appear to have been positioned flanking the right of the second line, though one source places them in the centre.Pittock, M (2016) Culloden, Oxford University Press, p.27 After the failure of the Jacobite first line's attack, Lt-Col Lewis Drummond's battalion formed square before surrendering; other elements of the regiment under Maj. Matthew Hale covered the retreat of some of the Jacobite units towards Ruthven, surrendering two days later. The government was initially unsure whether to regard British subjects in the Royal-Ecossais as rebels or prisoners of war. France responded by demanding the passports of all British people in France and threatening to arrest any found without one; the British government backed down and most from the French regiments were eventually discharged. Although many of them were found to be Scots or English Protestants, the authorities decided not to risk making further difficulties from the situation apart from 16 found to be deserters, who were hanged after courts martial.McCorry (1996), 22 During 1747 the regiment rebuilt to make up for losses sustained at Culloden and as prisoners of war returned from Britain. Back on the Continent, John Drummond served at the Siege of Bergen op Zoom in July-September 1747, where he was Brigadier in command of the piquets in the trenches; his regiment however does not seem to have joined him, being first recorded in October as part of the Armee de Saxe at Nieuport.Maclean-Bristol, 104-105 Drummond died at Bergen op Zoom towards the end of the siege and Lewis Drummond took over as Colonel, with Lancelot Cuthbert of Castlehill as Lieutenant-Colonel. The Royal- Ecossais' colonel from 1757 onwards was David Wemyss, Lord Elcho, an exiled veteran of the 1745 Rising; Elcho was left embittered by the regiment's disbandment, as well as with his experience of Jacobite and French service in general. Several other prominent Jacobite exiles also continued to serve as officers, amongst them Ewen MacPherson of Cluny, Donald MacDonnell of Lochgarry and Archibald Cameron of Lochiel, who was captain of the regiment's grenadier company. It continued service during the Seven Years' War, often on garrison duties, until disbandment as the war was ending. The Royal-Ecossais regimental traditions were preserved by the French Army's 87th Infantry Regiment until the latter was disbanded in 1940.

Consideration was first given to \\"bringing the Mass to Polegate\\" in the late 19th century, when it was a rapidly growing village within the vast Catholic parish of the seaside resort of Eastbourne to the south. Only with the arrival of a new priest at Eastbourne in 1936 was any action taken; but within two years construction work was underway and by the end of 1938 the simple but \\"very dignified\\" flint- and stone-built Gothic Revival church was opened. Structural problems occurred after World War II as expenditure was concentrated on other churches in the parish, and remedial work had to be carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. St George's Church has experienced five changes to the composition of its parish. It was initially a chapel of ease within Eastbourne parish, but in 1958 it became a separate district within Eastbourne with its own priest and two years later became independent of Eastbourne when the new parish of Polegate with Hampden Park was created. Five years later Polegate was separated from Hampden Park, but the two parishes merged again before another change in the early 21st century created the joint parish of Hailsham and Polegate. Weekly Masses are held, and the church is registered for the solemnisation of marriages. History The entrance porch \\"projects oddly\\" beyond the nave. Polegate, originally a small village in the parish of Hailsham, grew rapidly in the 19th and early 20th century after the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway opened two routes which met at a junction there. There were only 50 houses in 1873, but by the early 21st century the population exceeded 8,000 and suburban development linked the town to its larger southern neighbour Eastbourne. Our Lady of Ransom Church in Eastbourne town centre served Polegate as part of its extensive parish. In October 1895, the priest of that church told the Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Southwark that there was demand for Mass to be celebrated in various distant towns and villages. In Polegate, from Eastbourne, he said there were nine Catholics who could be better served by a local place of worship. In the same year, a man named William Attwood of Osborne House died. The house (no longer in existence) had a private oratory which may have been used for public Masses, although there is no definitive record of this. Nothing more happened until 1913, when another man allowed his house in the Hampden Park area of Eastbourne (close to Polegate) to be used for worship. This arrangement was formalised into a monthly celebration of Mass from May 1919. Father John Corballis became parish priest of Our Lady of Ransom Church in January 1936 and immediately \\"set his mind on building a church at Polegate\\". The following month he paid ¬£1,318.10s.10d. for a plot of land on the southeast corner of the Polegate crossroads‚Äîthe junction of the High Street and the main road to Eastbourne. This debt was cleared with the help of regular fundraising at that church. Building work on the site was planned to begin in summer 1938 and an architect was commissioned to design the new church. On 7 June 1938, Bishop William Francis Brown, Auxiliary Bishop of Southwark and Titular Bishop of Pella, led a service at which the foundation stone was laid. Building work took exactly six months, and on 7 December 1938 Bishop Peter Amigo and several priests from Eastbourne attended the first Mass in the church, which was dedicated to Saint George. Construction cost ¬£4,000 and fittings cost a further ¬£500, and a balance of ¬£3,000 was outstanding. At first there was one Mass on a Saturday evening and one on a Sunday morning, and this pattern continued throughout the time the church was a chapel of ease to Our Lady of Ransom Church. Stations of the Cross were installed in March 1939. World War II brought a large influx of evacuees, mostly children, to the Eastbourne area, and many more people attended the churches in the parish: St George's Church was described as \\"full\\" each week. Later in the war, as evacuees left and bombing raids made the town unsafe, services at all churches in the parish were cut back and some closed temporarily, but St George's remained open. After the war, attention turned to providing a larger church at Hailsham, buying a site for a future church at Hampden Park and reorganising the vast parish of Eastbourne. Canon John Curtin, who became priest of Our Lady of Ransom Church in January 1956, decided to create independent parishes for several of the chapels of ease in the parish, including Polegate‚Äînoting that this was \\"in accordance with their express desire over many years\\". The process happened in two stages. In July 1958 Father John Flanagan was appointed as the first parish priest of Polegate with Hampden Park, although at first it was still a district within Eastbourne parish. St George's Church was not formally separated from Eastbourne until June 1960 when St Joachim's Church opened at Hampden Park and the new parish of Polegate with Hampden Park was formally created. Prior to the opening of St Joachim's, Hampden Park residents worshipped at St Gregory's Church in the Old Town of Eastbourne or at St George's; then from August 1958 Mass was celebrated in a public hall and then in a derelict house in the grounds of which St Joachim's was built. Meanwhile, as early as 1952 St George's Church was found to have been experiencing subsidence \\"for some time\\", and when Canon Curtin took over the church the altar and most of the seats had to be destroyed because they were infested with dry rot and woodworm respectively; the church was unheated, the walls and floor \\"were of rough uncovered cement\\", and the site was found to be waterlogged causing the building to be affected by damp. Our Lady of Ransom Church paid for improvements to be carried out, and in 1965 more extensive work was undertaken at a cost of ¬£20,000. In September 1965 the composition of St George's parish changed for the third time when St Joachim's Church at Hampden Park was given its own parish served by a new priest. Fr Flanagan, who had taken over St George's Church in 1958 when it was separate from Hampden Park but still part of Eastbourne parish, was now in charge solely of Polegate. St Joachim's Church again became part of a joint parish with St George's Church in 1999, but after further reorganisation in the early 21st century the churches separated and a new joint parish was formed covering Hailsham and Polegate. By 2005, St George's Church was served by priests from St Wilfrid's Church in Hailsham, while by 2007 Hampden Park was served from the Church of Christ the King at Langney. Architecture St George's Church was built by the firm of W. Llewellyn & Sons and designed by J. O'Hanlon Hughes and Geoffrey Webb. The same architects had worked together in 1935 at St Thomas More Church in nearby Seaford, where the nave, sanctuary and south aisle they designed survive with later additions. Elsewhere in Sussex, Webb was responsible for a stained glass window at Roedean School and a sculpture in St Dunstan's Church, Mayfield, as well as a village sign there. The 1938 edition of The Catholic Calendar and Blotter publication described Hughes as the architect and Webb as a \\"technical advisor\\". The church is a simple building in the Perpendicular Gothic Revival style: a long rectangle with no transepts or side chapels, a single-span gabled roof and a side porch which \\"projects oddly beyond the west wall\\" of the nave. The walls are of local flint dressed with Portland stone, and the groups of four slightly arched windows in the side (north and south) walls are set in simple rectangular surrounds. In the east and west walls are taller four-light windows with slightly more complex tracery. The overall appearance is \\"Gothic, but only just\\". The interior is also unadorned, with a canted ceiling. At the opening ceremony, Fr Corballis remarked that while \\"not exotic\\", the design was \\"in harmony with the surrounding downland\\" and \\"plain ‚Ä¶ [but] very dignified\\". Administration and services The church is licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and has the registration number 58747. It was registered to conduct marriages on 26 February 1940. St George's Church is part of the Hailsham and Polegate parish, along with St Wilfrid's Church in Hailsham from which it is served. The parish is one of four (covering eight churches) which make up the Deanery of Eastbourne. In turn, this is one of 13 deaneries in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. As of 2019 the parish of Hailsham and Polegate is served by one priest who celebrates Mass at 9.00 am on Sundays at St George's and offers the Sacrament of Penance monthly, as well as offering two Masses and the Sacrament of Penance weekly at St Wilfrid's. St George's is one of four places of worship in Polegate town, along with Anglican, United Reformed and Seventh-day Adventist churches. In 2005‚Äì06, the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton analysed the attendance, capacity and parish structure of all of its churches. It reported that one priest served the parish of Hailsham and Polegate, one Sunday Mass was celebrated at St George's Church, and the average attendance there was 88 worshippers. The seating capacity was given as 100, although a report about the opening service in 1938 stated that there was accommodation for 120 worshippers.

Research  Szarewski gained her PhD in ‚ÄòThe effect of cessation of smoking on cervical lesion size and immune cell parameters‚Äô, where she showed that, in the absence of treatment, early signs of cervical disease that were picked up through screening in smokers were much more likely to disappear if women gave up smoking. While completing her PhD she also worked on HPV testing for cervical cancer with Jack Cuzick. Szarewski was the clinical lead on the study that showed that testing for the presence of HPV DNA in cells taken during cervical screening would pick up cases of pre-cancer that were missed by the routine test. This work was followed by a larger trial testing HPV screening ‚Äì the HART study.

It revolves around the two grandsons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Hassan and Hussein, and their relationship with their companions, sedition that occurred between them and their companions after the killing of Usman ibn Affan. It shows alleged Jewish conspiracies through the personality of Abdullah bin Saba, and his role in stirring sedition. The series is a co- production among Qatari, Syrian, Kuwaiti, Moroccan and Jordanian elements. It deals with the epic strife that created a rift across the Islamic Ummah. The period extends from the beginning of the sedition, after the martyrdom of Caliph Uthman bin Affan, through the assumption of Ali, the martyrdom of Ali and Hassan, and the concession of Hassan and take over of Muawiya. Hussein in Karbala deals with the serial events of the battle of the two sentences. The series caused a sensation when it objected to the issuance of many religious scholars and Shiites and was boycotted by the Iraqi government and banned from Iraqi channels.

He is known for his contributions to Aircraft Design, especially with his book \\"Synthesis of Subsonic Airplane Design\\" published in 1976. This standard work was also translated into Russian and Chinese. Professor Torenbeek received the 58th Ludwig Prandtl Ring (2016) \\"in recognition of his outstanding scientific achievements in the field of aircraft design in teaching, research and application\\" from the German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics. Career Egbert Torenbeek studied at Delft Institute of Technology from 1956 to 1961 and graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering. Afterwards in 1961 he took the \\"Guided Missiles Course\\" at College of Aeronautics in Cranfield, England, which was followed by his military service from 1962 to 1963 in the Netherlands. He returned to Delft Institute of Technology in 1963 to start work under Hans Wittenberg, professor of aircraft design. Torenbeek had to supervise a laboratory course and found that there was no up-to-date handbook on aircraft design. So, he collected information on designing aeroplanes that had been published up until 1970. This was when jet planes like the DC-8 and the Boeing 707 were already operational and Concorde had already had its first flight. Therefore, one of the challenges was gathering the latest information on aircraft design. Finally, after about 5 years of work, supported also by university employees, the book \\"Synthesis of Subsonic Aircraft Design\\" was published by Delft University Press in 1976. Today, the book is distributed by Springer. In 1977 a sabbatical at Lockheed Georgia, USA followed. Torenbeek became full professor of aircraft design at Delft University of Technology in 1980. In 1993 he participated in the design of the Extra 400: \\"The airframe was designed with engineering help from the Technical University of Delft in Holland under leadership from Prof. Egbert Torenbeek\\". LBA Type Certificate Date was obtained on 1997-07-22. The first European Workshop on Aircraft Design Education (EWADE) was held in Madrid in 1994, of which Torenbeek was a co-founder.

He was also known as:Ludwig Moroder dl Meune or Lodovico Moroder.Gino Salvaneschi, Montanari Scultori di Val Gardena, La Gazzetta del Popolo 2-3-1937, p. 3. Biography He was born in Ortisei, which at the time was a famous tourist destination in Val Gardena, his family was renowned in the small town as its members were appointed to be lifelong sacristans in the local church. His father used to carve wooden Crosses but he passed before he could pass the skill onto his son.Riccardo Toccaceli, Lodovico Moroder. Un vero maestro, L'Adige, 18-8-1954. Ludwig learnt to carve wood from Professor Franz Haider, Josef Moroder-Lusenberg and Franz Tavella. He worked in the Moroder family workshop as well in Lenert's house in Ortisei, he was also promoted to the role of technical director in the atelier of the Moroder brothers in Offenburg in Baden-W√ºrttemberg Germany. Between 1900 and 1914 he sculpted several altars requested by churches for the Moroder Brothers workshop, these altars were characterised by Neo-Gothic styled statues. According to his daughter, he took part in the production of the sculpture of Elizabeth of Hungary attributed to Rudolf Moroder, which is now exposed in the parochial church of Ortisei. this particular sculpture was awarded a gold medal at the world exposition in Paris in 1900.Riccardo Toccaceli, Lodovico Moroder. Un vero maestro, L'Adige, 18-8-1954. In 1911 he married Adele Moroder which had blood ties with Franz Moroder the owner of the Moroder Brothers workshop, because of his family ties he was employed in the workshop of Lenert's house, at a later time four of his wife's brothers died in WWI, leaving his wife as the sole heir.Riccardo Toccaceli, Lodovico Moroder. Un vero maestro, L'Adige, 18-8-1954. Adele bore five children: Alessandro in 1913, Maria in 1914, Carlo in 1917, Pauli in 1919 and Alex in 1923. Two of his children, Carlo and Pauli, became wood carvers. Ludwig Moroder in 1918 was charged by the Vienna government to dedicate his life to the teaching of drawing, sculpting and modelling in the school of art of Ortisei where he taught for 27 years. Under the influence of the director of the school, Guido Balsamo Stella, between 1924 and 1927 Ludwig Moroder underwent a significant evolution of his sculpting style, which became more refined and contemporary.Carlo Galasso, Ludwig Moroder 1879-1953, Museum de Gherd√´ina, Ortisei 1973. His numerous travels in the Italian art cities also contributed to the evolution of his style. In 1920 Ludwig Moroder founded the artistic circle of the artisans of Ortisei.100 anni Istituto d'Arte di Ortisei 1890-1990, Ortisei 1990, pp. 16‚Äì17. On 24 April 1935 he was awarded the title of \\"Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia\\" (knight of the Italian order of the crown) by the king Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.

The entity's stated goals are to improve healthcare services and lower costs for the three companies' employees, while making primary care easier to access, making prescription drugs more affordable and rendering insurance benefits easier to understand. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, with offices in New York City. History 2018 On January 30, 2018, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase announced the formation of a company to provide low-cost and high quality healthcare for their more than million worldwide employees. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon said at the time of the announcement, \\"The three of our companies have extraordinary resources, and our goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\\" And Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett said, Health care costs are \\"a hungry tapeworm on the American economy\\". In June 2018, Atul Gawande was appointed as chief executive officer of Haven Healthcare. In November 2018, Dana Gelb Safran, formerly of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, was hired as head of measurement. In December, the company hired David Smith, formerly of UnitedHealth Group's Optum subsidiary. His hiring resulted in Optum suing Smith for breach of contract, claiming that he had violated a non-compete restriction. In February 2019, District Judge Mark Wolf denied Optum's motion to stop Smith from working at Haven. 2019 In February 2019, Haven hired Serkan Kutan, former CTO of ZocDoc, as CTO. In April 2019, the company announced opening a second location in the Union Square area of Manhattan and will focus on technology and engineering. In May 2019, chief operating officer Jack Stoddard announced he was leaving his role after just nine months, noting that the commute between Philadelphia and Boston was taking him away from his family. In November 2019, Haven announced they would partner with Cigna and CVS Health's Aetna to offer health plans to 30,000 JP Morgan workers in the states of Arizona and Ohio. Amazon will also be offering healthcare coverage to employees in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Utah, and Connecticut, in collaboration with an unnamed healthcare payer. The new wellness plan offers monthly financial rewards for meeting health and fitness goals.  2020  In May 2020, CEO Atul Gawande announced that he was leaving the company.

Nooyi Dean and Frederic D. Wolfe Professor of Economics, Policy, and Management at the Yale School of Management. He is also a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and an elected Fellow of the Society of Labor Economists. He has been chair of the Board of trustees of NORC, serves on the Board of Trustees of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, is a member of the Federal Economic Statistics Advisory Committee, and sits on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Labor Economics. He was previously the Edwin A. and Betty L. Bergman Distinguished Service Professor of the Harris School of Public Policy at The University of Chicago, and was a professor at the University of Michigan from 1995 - 2006.  Deanship  On December 5, 2019, Charles announced that the Yale School of Management had received the largest gift in its history‚Äî$100 million to fund programs devoted to strengthening leadership in public school systems. The gift came from The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation and will make possible the creation of the Broad Center at the Yale School of Management. The new center will oversee a new Master's Degree in Education Management and executive training for top leaders in public school systems‚Äîboth tuition-free. The Broad Center at Yale SOM will also create a data repository of research related to leadership effectiveness in K-12 education.  Research  Charles' work has focused on a variety of topics related to applied microeconomics, labor markets, and race/gender, including earnings and wealth inequality, conspicuous consumption, race and gender labor market discrimination, the intergenerational transmission of economic status, worker and family adjustment to job loss and health shocks, non-work among prime-aged persons, and the labor market consequences of housing bubbles and sectoral change. Collaborating with Patrick Bayer, he studied earnings differences between black and white men in the U.S. between 1940 and 2014. The study found that the median black-white earnings gap was the same in 2014 as it had been in 1950. However, they also found that black men higher in the income distribution narrowed the gap, mainly due to advances by those with a college education. With Erik Hurst and Matthew J. Notowidigdo, he found that the housing boom that preceded the Great Recession depressed college enrollment as young people opted into the labor market, a trend that was only partially reversed during the subsequent housing crash. In work with Erik Hurst and Nikolai Roussanov, he has found that Black and Hispanic Americans spend more on visible consumption and automobile expenses: \\"Conspicuous consumption\\" than White Americans, and that some of this difference appears to be motivated by an attempt by Black Americans to appear wealthier than they actually are. In work with Ming-Ching Luoh, he has found that the high incarceration rates of black men affect marriage rates and non-marital childbearing among Black families in the United States. In recent research with Jonathan Guryan and Jessica Pan, using decades of Census and General Social Survey data, he has shown that the careers of white women in the United States are influenced by the level of sexism in their states of birth.

Drafted into the Red Army in the late 1920s, Vasilyev became a junior officer after graduating from a military school and held command and staff positions during the 1930. Just before the beginning of World War II, Vasilyev became a regimental commander and was decorated for his leadership of the unit during the Winter War. After the end of the latter, he became deputy division commander of the 87th Rifle Division, succeeding to command after his division commander was killed in the first days after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. Vasilyev was himself killed in the Battle of Kiev.  Early life and prewar service  Vasilyev was born on 27 October 1906 in Zaraysk, Ryazan Governorate. Drafted into the Red Army in October 1926, he was sent to study at the VTsIK Combined Military School in Moscow. After graduation in October 1929, he was sent to the 47th Rifle Regiment of the 16th Rifle Division in the Leningrad Military District. He served with the regiment for nearly ten years, including as a rifle platoon commander, regimental school platoon commander, machine gun company commander, battalion chief of staff, head of the regimental school, and commander of its training battalion. In March 1939 he was transferred to the 46th Rifle Regiment as assistant regimental commander for personnel. In August of that year he was appointed commander of the 461st Rifle Regiment of the 142nd Rifle Division. During the Winter War the regiment and division fought in heavy combat with the 19th Rifle Corps of the 7th Army on the Karelian Isthmus. For his \\"skillful command of the regiment, courage, and heroism\\", Vasilyev, then a major, was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. After the end of the war, in May 1940, he was appointed deputy commander and chief of the infantry of the 87th Rifle Division of the Kiev Special Military District.  World War II  At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the 87th was part of the 5th Army, which became part of the Southwestern Front (formed from the Kiev Special Military District), based in the area of Vladimir-Volynsky. The division was one of the first struck by the German advance, participating in the border battles. Vasilyev became commander of the division after division commander Major General Filipp Alyabushev was killed after stumbling on a German unit while reconnoitering a highway crossing site on 25 June. From 7 July to 20 August it was directly subordinated to the front command, then joined the 37th Army for the Battle of Kiev. After Kiev fell to the German advance on 19 September, the 87th was encircled with the 37th Army in a pocket around Boryspil to the southeast of the city. Vasilyev's 87th Rifle Division and the 4th Railway Protection Division of the NKVD formed the rearguard of the army as it attempted to break out of the pocket and escape to the east. After sappers from the 37th Army and the 4th Division blew up the bridges over the Dnieper, the commander of the NKVD division contacted Vasilyev to coordinate further actions. Early in the morning of 20 September, both units reached the eastern edge of the Darnitsky forest. A reconnaissance by the NKVD troops found that the planned escape route via Boryspil was blocked by German troops, and the fighting devolved into increasingly desperate breakout attempts. During the latter, Vasilyev was killed in action north of Piryatin. He was survived by his wife, Anna Georgievna.

He is a research staff member at Engineering Optimization Research Group (2002‚Äìpresent) and a member of the Board of \\"Center of Excellence of Geomatic Engineering\\" (2005‚Äìpresent). He was a Visiting Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), USA (2010-2012). His main research interests include Graph Theory, Advanced Algorithms, Complexity Theory, and Approximation Algorithm, in particular, Vulnerability in Networks and Tenacity parameter. The concept of graph tenacity was introduced by Dara Moazzami and his professors Cozzens and Stueckle as a measure of network vulnerability and reliability. Dara Moazzami is the translator of the widely used and popular textbook on \\"Graph Theory\\" by J. A. Bondy and U.S.R. Murty and \\"Combinatorics\\" by Bela Bollobas. He is also the author of a textbook on \\"Differential Equations\\", which is widely used by Iranian students all over the world. He is the translator of textbook on \\"Abstract Algebra: Theory and Application\\" by Thomas W. Judson, (2017). He is also the author of three textbooks on \\"Tenacity Parameter and Their Application in Designing Stable Networks\\" and \\"Stability and Vulnerability in Networks\\" and \\"Graph Drawing\\". Two more books \\"Advanced Algorithm: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness\\" and \\"Approximation Algorithms\\" are currently in works. The Tenacity of a Graph Professor Moazzami's research interests lie on the field of Graph Theory, Advanced Algorithms, Complexity Theory, and Approximation Algorithm. Particularly, he is interested in vulnerability in networks and tenacity parameter. The concept of graph tenacity was introduced by Cozzens, Moazzami, and Stueckle in their landmark studies as a measure of network vulnerability and reliability. Conceptually, graph vulnerability relates to the study of graph intactness when parts of its elements are removed. The motivation for studying vulnerability measures is derived from the design and analysis of networks in a hostile environment. Graph tenacity has been an active area of research since the concept was introduced in 1992. Dr. Moazzami introduced two measures of network vulnerability termed the tenacity, T (G), and the Mix- tenacity, Tm (G), of a graph. The tenacity T (G) of a graph G is defined as T (G) = \\\\underset{A\\\\subset V\\\\left(G\\\\right)}{\\\\mathit{\\\\min }}\\\\left\\\\lbrace \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\vert A\\\\right\\\\vert +\\\\tau \\\\left(G-A\\\\right)}{\\\\omega \\\\left(G-A\\\\right)}\\\\right\\\\rbrace where \\\\tau denotes the order (the number of vertices) of a largest component of G-Aand \\\\omega \\\\left(G-A\\\\right)is the number of components of G-A. The Mix- tenacity Tm (G) of a graph G is defined as T(G) = \\\\underset{A\\\\subset E\\\\left(G\\\\right)}{\\\\mathit{\\\\min }}\\\\left\\\\lbrace \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\vert A\\\\right\\\\vert +\\\\tau \\\\left(G-A\\\\right)}{\\\\omega \\\\left(G-A\\\\right)}\\\\right\\\\rbrace where \\\\tau denotes the order (the number of vertices) of a largest component of G-Aand \\\\omega \\\\left(G-A\\\\right)is the number of components of G-A. Both parameters of T (G) and Tm (G) have shown to have important implications. Following the pioneering work of Cozzens, Moazzami, and Stueckle, several groups of researchers have started investigating the tenacity and related problems. Department of Engineering Science After the establishment of the University of Tehran in 1934, the College of Engineering, as one of the first six faculties of the University was founded through the efforts made by the late Professor Mahmoud Hesabi. It began its activities by admitting 40 students in the fields of Civil, Electromechanical, and Mining Engineering in the same year. One of the oldest departments in the College of Engineering at the University of Tehran was the Department of Engineering Basic Sciences which was established to provide general courses such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature and so on for the engineering students. Later, in 2007, under supervision of Prof. Dara Moazzami this department became the Department of Engineering Science, which he became a Chairman of. Since Dr. Moazzami was the leader of the team to establish the first Department of Engineering Science (University of Tehran) in Iran, he has been entitled as the Father of Engineering Science in Iran. The Engineering Science Program is a multi- departmental and interdisciplinary program. This undergraduate program encompasses a variety of closely related areas of physics, mathematical sciences, and engineering. It is intended to provide a means whereby students can acquire knowledge of engineering methods, while pursuing their interests in areas of natural science. The options offered within the curriculum prepare students for advanced studies in engineering and science. There are three fully structured majors in the curriculum including:* Computational Engineering Science * Engineering Mathematics * Engineering Physics Department of Algorithms and Computation With efforts of Prof. Dara Moazzami, the Department of Algorithms and Computation was established in 2005 when he became the Chairman of the Faculty of Engineering Science. In 2016 the first group of PhD. Students were accepted into this Department. Master of Science and PhD in Algorithms and Computation cover very broad areas of algorithms and computation. The scope of this program includes both theoretical and applied research from these fields. The main aim of this program is to promote the exchange of ideas in this active research community. The specific themes targeted for Master of science in Algorithms and Computation are Computational Geometry, Algorithms and Data Structures, Approximation Algorithms, Randomized Algorithms, Graph Drawing and Graph Algorithms, Combinatorial Algorithms, Graphs in Bioinformatics, String Algorithms, Combinatorial Optimization, Computational Biology, Computational Finance, Cryptography, and Parallel and Distributed Algorithms. The Journal of Algorithms and Computation The Journal of Algorithms and Computation, currently, published in English, is a continuation of the Journal of the Faculty of Engineering \\"Fani\\" at the University of Tehran. This journal was published in Persian from 1980 till 2012. The Journal of \\"Fani\\" published 43 volumes during this period. Following 2012, the Faculty of Engineering has concluded to have several journals in English. The aim of the Journal of Algorithms and Computation is to bring together research papers in different areas of algorithmic and applicable discrete mathematics as well as applications of combinatorial mathematics to informatics and various areas of science and technology. Contributions presented to the journal can be research papers, short notes, surveys, and possibly research problems. The \\"Communications\\" section will be devoted to the fastest possible publication of the brief outlines of recent research results, the detailed presentation of which might be submitted for possible publication in the Journal of Algorithms and Computation or elsewhere. The journal also publishes a limited number of book announcements as well as proceedings of conferences. These proceedings are fully reviewed and adhere to the general standards of the journal. The founder (and also the Editor-in-Chief) of the journal is Dara Moazzami. The members of the editorial board are Kambiz Badie, Eiichi Bannai, Helene Barcelo, Richard A. Brualdi, Hassan Emamirad, Hans-Dietrich Gronau, Gyula O. H. Katona, Daniel Kleitman, Jacobus H. Koolen, Charles C.

The war would impact women's everyday lives. Feminist solutions to problems of women in this period often took an individualistic approach. For women of the Second Republic, by close of the Civil War their efforts for liberation would fail. While various parties were working to encourage women to their ranks, it was often about reinforcing their own membership numbers and women would be locked out of opportunities for advancement and women's concerns would continue to be ignored on both the Nationalist and Republican sides. Unlike previous wars including World War II, women for the first time would be involved in large numbers in combat and in support roles on the front. Republican women had the choice to be actively involved in fighting fascism. The first Spanish Republican women to die on the battlefield was Lina Odena on 13 September 1936. The May Days of 1937 would see leftist women turn on each other, with a number of women being imprisoned, killed or forced into exile not at the hand of fascists by Stalinist Communists on their own side. The war ended in 1939, with thirteen women executed as part of a larger group of fifty-six prisoners in Madrid on 5 August 1939 because of their membership in United Socialist Youth that year. The war also saw the folding of Mujeres Libres, and women facing horrible conditions in prison.  Start of the Civil War  Location of Melilla, where Nationalist forces started their campaign in 1936 On 17 July 1936, the Uni√≥n Militar Espa√±ola launched a coup d'√©tat in North Africa and Spain. They believed they would have an easy victory. They failed to predict the people's attachment to the Second Republic. With the Republic largely maintaining control over its Navy, Franco and others in the military successfully convinced Adolf Hitler to provide transport for Spanish troops from North Africa to the Iberian peninsula. These actions led to a divided Spain, and the protracted events of the Spanish Civil War. It would not officially end until 1 April 1939. Franco's initial coalition included monarchists, conservative Republicans, Falange Espa√±ola members, Carlist traditionalist, Roman Catholic clergy and the Spanish army. They had support from fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The Republican side included Socialists, Communists, and various other left wing actors. The military revolt was announced on the radio across the country, and people took to the streets immediately as they tried to determine the extent of the situation, and if it was a military or political conflict. Dolores Ib√°rruri would soon coin the phrase \\"¬°No pasar√°n!\\" a few days later, on 18 July 1936 in Madrid while on the radio from the Ministry of the Interior's radio station, saying, \\"It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. ¬°No pasar√°n!\\" At the start of the Civil War, there were two primary anarchist organizations: Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI). Representing working-class people, they set out to prevent the Nationalists from seizing control while also serving as reforming influences inside Spain. Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed the Non- Intervention Treaty in August 1936, promising not to provide material support for the war to any of the parties, even as Germany and Italy were already and continued to provide support to Spain's fascists.  Overview  During the Civil War, the problems of everyday life for women changed at times. In major cities like Madrid and Barcelona, women were subjected to much less street harassment. When serving out near the front, men and women could share the same men bed without women having to fear being molested. Women had gone from being objects of men's attention to being viewed as fellow human beings. By the final stretch of the war, women were having to do the jobs of men in many cases as there were not enough men around to do them. Their presence and the need of their presence often induced anxiety among men, who felt threatened by their presence in factories. As a result of the start of the Civil War, many women's organizations on both the right and the left were shutting down. In the Civil War period, mainstream leftist feminism often took on an individualistic approach to addressing inequalities. There was also often battles over this issue, whether the personal should be political and vice versa. A few groups challenged the mainstream feminism of the period, including Mujeres Libres. While deliberately rejecting the label of feminism, the group's version of feminism was about creating leadership structures that incorporated everyone, instead of having a feminist leadership model that paralleled patriarchal ones. Many feminists disliked the organization though, as it was affiliated with CNT, where women were often locked out of leadership positions and instead encouraged into their women's auxiliary organization. Others disliked Mujeres Libres decision to downplay the role of specific female leaders, and instead make all feminist actions appear the sole result of collectivist action. Women's liberation failed on the Republican side by the close of the Civil War. The lack of implementing full liberation during the peaceful period of the Second Republic was a leading cause, as sexist thinking that existed on that side had continued to exist and only found itself being further reinforced as the war progressed. The Spanish Civil War served to break traditional gender roles on the Republican side. It allowed women to fight openly on the battlefield, a rare occurrence in twentieth century European warfare. The war also served to remove the influence of the Catholic Church in defining gender roles on the Republican side. While the war broke down gender norms, it did not create an equitable employment change or remove the domestic tasks as the primary role of women. Behind the scene, away from the front, women serving in personal family and Republican opposition support roles were still expected to cook for soldiers, launder their uniforms, look after children and tend to dwellings. Women supporting CNT militants found themselves at once liberated from these gender roles, but still expected to serve male fighters in traditional roles.  Role in the family  Mothers had a variety of different experiences during the Civil War depending on their personal situations. Many mothers in rural areas were apolitical, no matter what side of the front they lived on. They had little access to resources that would have allowed them to be politically engaged, and were often short on resources required for basic living. During the war, mothers worked hard to try to maintain a sense of normalcy. This included continuing domestic education, both among Republican and Nationalist women. Topics of focus included understanding the water, agriculture and religious education. Spanish sayings used by mothers at this time included, \\"After you eat, do not read a single letter.\\" Reading was not viewed as good for digestion. Children were also encouraged by their mothers in rural areas to take a siesta after a meal. During the war, many mothers went to great lengths to try to feed their children during periods of food shortages. They might sneak into other towns to try to get food rations when the ration in their town was too small. They might forgo eating themselves so their children could have bigger portions. For many mothers in rural areas, the idea of being politically engaged was not possible. They had too many things they had to do at home to have time for that. They had to make soap. They had to work in the fields because of national rationing. Most Spanish homes during the war lacked running water at home. Mothers had to acquire water from local wells, lakes or rivers. They had to wash clothing for the whole family, making a journey to a body of water to do that. They also had to be home to prepare food when it was available. Most homes at this time did not have modern kitchens, and mothers had to cook over open flames using hay and wood for heat. The war upset the social structure inside the family. Because of survival issues related to food and fear of political persecution, the skills of mother in acquiring and preparing food while also remaining politically invisible meant they began to take on the role of head of household. Silence became a virtue, because doing or saying the wrong thing could lead to death at the hands of Nationalist forces. Women were less likely to be harassed than men, which meant they were often more out of the home. This could create tensions behind closed doors, as it attacked traditional Spanish definitions of masculinity as it made the home the domain of the mother. This change of women being the boss of the home would continue after the Civil War for both Republican and Nationalist families. The repressive nature of the Civil War and women needing to take charge of the family in rural Spain led to feelings of solidarity among women, and specifically mothers, in pueblos. It led to mothers creating a form of female specific identity that had largely not existed in rural Spain prior to the war.  Political parties and political activity  During the Spanish Civil War, various political and government forces on the Republican side tried to encourage women's participation on their side. Only one group though would be overtly about feminist goals. That group was Mujeres Libres. For the rest of the political parties, labor groups and government organizations, women's rights and feminists goals were not one of their top concerns. Working-class girls involved with both anarchists and socialists often found themselves ostracizing women from other villages who came from different left wing political parties. There was a lack of solidarity. Pilar Vivancos explained this as a result of a lack of education among women, with patriarchy within parties being used to set women against each other instead of collectively workings towards emancipation of women. They did not understand what it truly meant, and it made them vulnerable to political puritanism that would later sweep through the left. Women continued to be locked out of political activity on the Republican side. Meetings for women's rights among union members might be only be attended by men, as the idea of allowing women to attend political events was often alien.  Anarchists  Anarcha- feminist militia during the Spanish Social Revolution During the Civil War, there were often tensions between the Mujeres Libres and other anarchist groups. The Economic Council of the Socialized Woodwork Industry and Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista both had women in high level leadership positions, and in leadership spots further down. In contrast, Mujeres Libres was a CNT auxiliary, and the women were often denied a specific spot at the table as there was a view among anarchist leaders that the adults, not women, should be the ones making decisions. Anarchists often were unwilling to give solidarity to women combating gender based problems at this time. There were always questions of if women should be fully integrated or should work in women's only groups to achieve specific aims. This resulted in making the movement less effective in accomplishing goals related to women. Most of the militias that were created during the immediate outbreak of the Civil War came from civil society groups like trade unions and political parties. CNT, UGT and other unions stepped in to provide logistical support for many of these militias. The number of women mobilized was never high. Most joined in order to further support political ideologies they supported. Most came from militant libertarian organizations like CNT, FAI and FIJL. These militias often lacked the typical military structure in order to better represent their ideologies and better mobilize local populations.  Anti-fascists  Anti-fascist organizations often attracted a heterogeneous membership. This at times could lead to major differences, discrepancies and priorities when it came to implementing anti-fascist programs. Different groups including socialists, communists and anarchists would sometimes work to take advantage of this inside these organizations. = Agrupaci√≥n de Mujeres Antifascistas = While the Agrupaci√≥n de Mujeres Antifascistas (AMA) represented women from a wide variety of political backgrounds, it ended up serving as a vehicle of communist orthodoxy designed to mobile women to support the Communist cause on the Republican side of the civil war.  Communists  The varying political parties during this period on the left would all work with each other and, in the latter stages of the war, against each other. The PCE would often be at the center of much of this, trying to attract support for their Stalinist Communism ideology from various left-wing factions. When they were not trying to directly collaborate, crossover in membership would see many communist women involved in other organizations. Female Stalinists actively participated in POUM and Trotskyite purges in Barcelona. Women like Teresa P√†mies were intentionally excluded POUM affiliated women even as they tried to build bridges with PSOE. Teresa P√†mies wrote for a number of Communist publications during the war while she was only a teenager. These publications included Juliol, Treball, and La Rambla. During the Civil War, Teresa P√†mies founded the Catalan branch of JSU. Near the end of the war, she was a delegate at the Second World Youth Peace Conference at Vassar College in the United States. While there, she was surrounded by all the Spanish leftist factions, except POUM. P√†mies would also be responsible for isolating POUM's youth organization, Juventudes Comunistas Ib√©ricas, in such a way that it would leave blood on her hands. Teresa P√†mies exclusion of POUM is notable as her cousins were part of the organization, and her opinion of them was that they were committed anti-Fascists. = Partido Comunista de Espa√±a = While other communist organizations existed, Partido Comunista de Espa√±a remained the dominant one. In the first year of the Civil War, the PCE rapidly increased their membership by nearly three-fold. Among the peasantry, women represented nearly a third of PCE's membership. During the Civil War, Dolores Ib√°rruri continued to travel the country to speak in opposition to Francoist forces. She also used radio to spread her message, becoming famous for calling men and women to arms. The Communist Party did not approve of her private life though, asking her to end her relationship with a male party member who was seventeen years younger than her, which she did. = Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista (POUM) = Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista (POUM) was the dissident communist party during this period. Their engagement for women involved trying to create specific female sub-organizations for them to join. POUM women served on the front, but were also engaged in many other important roles including in POUM governance, writing and publishing POUM affiliated publications, and serving as teachers among the civilian population.  Republican women supporters abroad  Much of the aid work on the Republican side by women supporters abroad was done by working-class women. In Scotland, they often utilized strollers and prams to collect donations. Working-class women were also heavily involved in organizing fundraisers in Scotland on behalf of Republicans. These were some of the few positions easily available to them, as they were and continued to be locked out of more overt political and union activity during the war.  Nationalists and Catholics  Caricature of Gracia y Justicia, conservative magazine of political humor published in Spain during the Second Republic. It shows a woman with her boyfriend, both humble, planning her marriage to a wealthy man (Don Gregorio) only to get his fortune after the divorce. The vignette is part of the campaign organized by Catholic right media and parties in order to avoid the legalization of divorce. The text that accompanies the cartoon reads: \\"I thought that first I will marry Don Gregorio, and with the money that I will take from him in the divorce, I will marry you and live happily.\\" Falangist women activists were often divided into groups, which were largely based on age. Younger activists often to be outside the home, working on Nationalist goals in Nationalist women's organizations. Older women Nationalist activists believed they should be outside the public eye, serving Nationalist interests by working in the home. Nationalist women in more rural, less cosmopolitan cities, often had more privileges than their urban counterparts. They were able to leave the house, regardless of their marital status, and engage in the everyday tasks required for living. Few people noticed and cared. While Nationalist forces believed women should be at home, the realities of war meant that women were required to work outside the home, in factories and other businesses. During the war, Nationalist publications encouraged women to stay at home in service of the family. They were discouraged from shopping, going to the movies and engaging in other behavior viewed as frivolous by Nationalist male leaders. Nationalist supporting women behind Nationalist lines also sometimes were involved in auxiliary roles. This included working as nurses, provisioners and support personnel. They were encouraged to do so by men as a means of supporting the traditional Spanish family structure. Many Spanish women during the war sided with the Nationalists, embracing the strict gender roles put forth by the Catholic Church. The sister of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera worked to mobilize these women in Secci√≥n Femenina, an umbrella organization of Falange, during the pre-Civil War period and later during the war. From 300 members in 1934, its membership swelled to 400,000 in 1938. Women involved with the organization often went on to work for Auxilio Social, which acted as a social assistance organization for widows, orphans and the destitute by providing them with food and clothing. In all these roles, Spanish Nationalist women never did so with the intention of challenging male authority; they wanted to see the continuance of Republican gender roles and to strengthen the Spanish family. Starting in October 1937, Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola started actively recruiting single women between the ages of 17 and 35 to do social work as a volunteer for six months. In some cases, service was mandatory. It represented the first mass mobilization of women by Nationalist forces. Auxilio Social became the largest Nationalist social aid organization during the civil war. It was modeled after Nazi Germany's Winter Aid program. Staffed by women wearing blue uniforms with white aprons, they worked in taking care of children and other displaced people, and in distributing aid. The purpose of women in this organization was to serve others in maintaining traditional Spanish families within a patriarchal state. Nationalist women had another organization for which they could volunteer. It was the Margaritas, and came from traditionalist Carlist philosophies. Their purpose was to support Spanish families, with a husband in charge of a pious and religious wife and obedient children. Pilar Jaraiz Franco, the niece of Francisco Frano, sympathized with her uncle's politics and, during the Civil War, spent some time in a Republican prison. Despite this, she gradually moved towards more socialist leanings as a result of the rigid gender norms forced on her during her childhood. Salamanca and Burgos became home to large numbers of women who were wives of military officers on the Nationalist side. They could largely live comfortable, as their part of Spain was not in a state of total war. Both cities had zones for homes, and military zones. The military zones were home to medical services and to prostitutes. Nationalist nurses working in these zones were viewed as essential but transgressive, as they were occupying male spaces. As such, their behavior was always highly watched. Poverty and economic need often pushed many women into prostitution, where it flourished behind Nationalist lines. That Nationalist forces were fighting for a Spain that supported traditional family structures and opposed to prostitution did nothing to stop Nationalist officers from using prostitutes. Despite nationalist ideals about the role of women, the Nationalist attracted single women from abroad to their cause. These women, by their mere existence, transgressed Nationalist teachings about women as they were traveling alone, accompanied by male guardians, and acting on their own behalves. Many were literate and well traveled. Many came from European aristocratic and were upper class. Full of self-confidence, they made Nationalists uncomfortable, especially in contrast to the typically poor, illiterate Spanish woman who had not traveled. Their advocacy on behalf of Franco was viewed by many as counter-productive as it suggested women could find success outside the home, when Francoists and Nationalists believed women belonged in the home. Nationalist forces did attract foreign women writers and photographers to their cause. These included Helen Nicholson, the Baroness de Zglinitzki, Jane Anderson, Pip Scott-Ellis, and Florence Farmborough. These women were all advocates of right wing-ideology, and militantly opposed to Communism. They came from a wide variety of right wing ideologies, including monarchists and fascism.  Civilian women on the home front  Many poor, illiterate and unemployed women often found themselves immersed in the ideological battle of the Civil War and its connected violence as a result of forces beyond her control. Some of these women chose to try to reassert control by becoming active participants in the violent struggle going on around them. When it came to deciding who was right and wrong, many women had to use their own moral judgement formed by a lifetime to do so. They were not guided by political radicalization leading to ideological based morality. Women and children behind the lines were used by all sides, as a way of trying to garner support for their sides in the Civil War both internally and internationally. Nationalists often appealed to Catholics overseas, condemning Republican bombings on women in civil populations, claiming over 300,000 women and children had been killed. This met with limited success in the United States, where Catholics were uneasy with bombings against women and children that were being committed by both sides. One tactic employed by Nationalist troops was to use women to try to lure out Republican forces from concealed positions. They would use women's voices or get women to say they were civilians under siege. As a consequence, some Republican troops were hesitant when confronting women under apparent siege on the front as they did not always trust claims of needs for assistance. Spanish women supported the Republican war efforts behind the front lines. They made uniforms, worked in munitions factors, and served in women's corps similar to those organized by the US and British during World War I. In Madrid, women would go in pairs to cafes around the city, collecting money to support in the war effort. Many women on the Republican side joined JSU, serving in civilian roles near the front. Behind Nationalist lines, all women were forbidden from wearing pants. Instead, women were to wear skirts, which had to be long. Shirts were required to be long sleeved. Rape was so common that many pregnant women did not know who the fathers of their children were. Rape, along with murder and torture, were frequent tools used by Nationalist forces to instill terror in women and keep them in line.  Women in combat and on the front  Because of changes in society, women who wanted to be involved in the fight against fascist forces had two options: they could fight on the front lines or they could serve in auxiliary roles away from the front. Their options were not limited, like that of many women near the battlefields of World War I, where the only available role was that of auxiliary role to support men on the front. While women had been sporadically involved in combat in Spain, no large organized force of female fighters () had been mobilized prior to the Civil War. Notable women who had participated in the past included Napoleon resistance fighter Agustina de Arag√≥n, Manuela Malasa√±a and Clara del Rey during the Peninsular War and Aida Lafuente, who took part in militant labor action in October 1934 in Asturias. During the Peninsular War, a writer for the La Gaceta de Madrid would ask why the city's women fighters exceeded their men in courage. Despite their status as national icons, these women were the exception to the rule about women's roles in war.  Death sentences and life in prison  Republican women in prisons often faced situations their male counterparts did not have to deal with. Unlike their male counterparts, many women given death sentences for military rebellion were given the status of common criminals. Some women in Nationalist zones found their husbands arrested and executed because a Nationalist soldier coveted her. Children were removed from their mothers, left in the care of family or to live on the streets. Some women with sons who fought for the Republic were forced to watch them be tortured or executed. Prior to going to prison, some women found themselves raped by male police officers. Some women were removed from prison at night by Falangists who would then rape them. During these nights away from prison by Falangist forces, some women were also branded with a yoke and arrows. Borrowing from a practice being used by Mussolini's forces in Italy, women in prison were often forced to drink castor oil with the intention of giving them diarrhea. The purpose was to humiliate these women when they soiled themselves. Women in prison often had a toilet ratio of one toilet for every 200 women. By the end of the Civil War, the Las Ventas Model Prison had swelled from 500 female prisoners to over 11,000.  1936  Women pleading with Nationalist forces for lives of prisoners in Constantina, Seville in 1936 Republican militia women in training during the Spanish Civil War The Moorish troops of General Gonzalo Queipo de Llana were promised the opportunity by the General to rape Republican women. It was not unusual, and turned into a standard practice for captured women to be turned over to these men for abuse as a way of terrifying local populations. 20 women believed to be Republican sympathizers were removed from a maternity ward in Toledo and executed. The Nationalist soldiers then threw their bodies down a nearby well, and proceeded to parade through a local village with the dead women's underwear draped on their rifles. Women were often highly involved with their local agricultural collectives during the war. When the local government tried to confiscate milk from Pe√±alba, Huesca, women farmers were some of the most vocal in protesting the action.  July 1936  In the fight against fascism, the militia woman () served as an important figure for Republican forces in the period between July and December 1936.  August 1936  Memorial plaque in Pamplona with the list of teachers murdered and cracked down on in the rearguard of Navarre by the Spanish Nationalists, 1936 and later Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres contra la Guerra y el Fascismo underwent a second name change in 1936, shortly after the start of the Civil War. Their new name was Agrupaci√≥n de Mujeres Antifascistas. From there, the group would play a prominent role in sending and supporting women on the front lines in the war. In August 1936, the Commission of Women's Aid in Madrid was created following a decree by the Republican Prime Minister. Sevilla, near Constantina and Lora, where anarchists played into Nationalists hands and were attacked, two pregnant women being executed Lina Odena, Casilda M√©ndez, A√≠da Lafuente, Rosario S√°nchez Mora, Concha Lozano, and Maruja Tomicoson were all milicianas who would be immortalized by the Republic during this period of active women's involvement in combat. POUM initially required both men and women in combat to also engage in support roles as needed. Women were in the trenches and stood guard. Captain Fernando Saavedra of the Sargento V√°zquez Battalion said these women fought just like men. Fidela Fern√°ndez de Velasco P√©rez had been trained in the use of arms before the start of the war, and served on the front lines right away outside Madrid. She captured a cannon from Fascist forces, before being transferred to the Toledo front. Her new unit was the same one which Rosario S√°nchez de la Mora was serving. There, Fern√°ndez de Velasco P√©rez fought on the front and sought action by going behind enemy lines to sabotage them alongside other shock troops. She learned how to construct bombs. An armed Republican miliciana in 1936 in a photo by Gerda Taro When the war broke out, Margarita Ribalta was initially assigned by JSU tto a position at headquarters. Unhappy with not being more involved, a few days later she enrolled with a Partido Comunista de Espa√±a column and was transferred to the front, where she volunteered to be part of an advance group trying to take a hill. She led her group, running between two Nationalist positions while carrying a machine gun. A Republican support plane mistook her group for fascists, bombing them and wounding Ribalta. In the first days of the war, Trinidad Revolto Cervello was involved in front line combat at the Military Headquarters and at the Atarazanas Barracks in Barcelona. Following that action, she joined Popular Militias and went to the Balaeric Islands, where she again saw front line action at Battle of Mallorca. Te√≥fila Madro√±al was another Spanish woman who served on the front lines. She enlisted in Leningrad Battalion during the first days of the war, underwent weapons training and then was deployed to the Estremadura highway during the Siege of Madrid. When Constantina was taken by Nationalist forces on 7 August 1936, those forces sought revenge for anarchist shooting of Nationalist prisoners. Women who had found themselves widowed recently or who had husbands serving with the Legionaries were raped in a mass orgy event fueled by alcohol provided by local wineries. On 10 August, show trials were held and many women were given death sentences for things like displaying Republican flags, expressing admiration for President Roosevelt or criticizing their employers. Among the women executed were two pregnant girls. In Lora, where Nationalist forces killed between six hundred and one thousand people in the summer of 1936, women who survived often had their heads shaved to where just a tuft remained, and that tuft then had a ribbon with monarchist colors tied to it. These women were also often subject to abuse and further humiliation. The start of the Civil War saw women in Barcelona change their behavior, notably in the way they dressed. For the first time, they were able to appear in public wearing pants without people perceiving them as violating societal norms about decency. Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia began to dominate on the socialist side in Catalonia late 1936, and finally consolidated power in 1937 on the Republican side. While other communist organizations existed, Partido Comunista de Espa√±a remained the dominant one. In the first year of the Civil War, the Partido Comunista de Espa√±a rapidly increased their membership by nearly three-fold. Among the peasantry, women represented nearly a third of PCE's membership. During the Civil War, Ib√°rruri earned herself the nickname La Pasionaria as she traveled the country to speak in opposition to Francoist forces. She also used radio to spread her message, becoming famous for calling men and women to arms, saying, \\"¬°No pasar√°n!\\" One of the most famous phrases she uttered in the civil war was, \\"It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees.\\" The Communist Party did not approve of her private life though, asking her to end her relationship with a male party member who was seventeen years younger than her, which she did. Female Stalinists actively participated in POUM and Trotskyite purges in Barcelona. Women like Teresa P√†mies intentionally excluded POUM affiliated women even as they tried to build bridges with PCE.  September 1936  The first Spanish Republican women to die on the battlefield was Lina Odena on 13 September 1936. With Nationalist forces overrunning her position, the unit commander chose to commit suicide rather than to surrender. Her death would be widely shared by both Republican and Falangist propagandists. With Nationalist forces threatening her with the potential of being raped by Moorish soldiers if she is does not surrender, Republicans were able to cast her as an innocent who chose death rather than to be debased and lose her honor. Falangist propaganda said there was never there and there was never a threat of rape. This made Odena's death meaningless. Beyond that, Falangist propaganda implied Odena had been guilty of murdering a Catholic priest a few weeks prior, with her suicide was a way of escaping punishment. In September 1936, the Largo Caballero Battalion which included about ten women, fought on the Sierra front. Those in combat included Josefina Vara. There are conflicting accounts by historians as to when the decision was made to remove women from the front on the Republican side. One side dates the decision to late fall of 1936 as the date when Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero gave the order. Others date the order to March 1937. What is most likely is that various political and military leaders made their own decisions based on their own beliefs that led to different groups of female combatants gradually being withdrawn from the front. But whatever date ascribed, women were being encouraged to leave the front by September 1936.  October 1936  The International Group of the Durruti Column had many women serving in it. Involved in fighting in October 1936 at Perdiguera, a group of these women died. The dead included Suzanna Girbe, Augusta Marx, Juliette Baudard, Eugenie Casteu and Georgette Kokoczinski. The next month, Suzanna Hans of the same group died at the battle of Farlete. Women militants and civilians were part of the group that found themselves trapped for four days at the Sig√ºenza Cathedral as a result of a Nationalist siege in October 1936. After running out of food and ammo, with the walls of the Cathedral beginning to fall from incessant cannon fire, many in the group decided to make a run for it at night. POUM Captain Mika Feldman de Etcheb√©h√®re was among those at the Cathedral. She was one of the approximately one third of people who fled who survived. Her bravery during the Siege of Sig√ºenza earned her a promotion to POUM's Lenin Battalion Second Company Captain. After recovering from the siege in Barcelona, she was ordered to Moncloa, where she was in charge of a special shock troop brigade. Pregnancy and nursing babies could not save women from death. In Zamora, death by firing squad was common for these women. Amparo Baray√≥n, who was still nursing, had her eight-month-old daughter removed from her arms and put into a Catholic orphanage on 11 October 1936. The following day, she was executed. Pregnant women with death sentences sometimes had their executions stayed long enough so that they could give birth, with their babies then being stolen by Nationalist sympathizers.  November 1936  Many Spaniards headed to Gibraltar to try to seek refuge from the war. The British were largely unwilling to deal with this as most did not want to return to Spain. Still, the British evacuated most Spaniards in Gibraltar to M√°laga. On 22 November 1936, they evacuated 157 on of which 54 were women and 82 were children. On 27 December 1936, 185 were evacuated on including 16 women and 26 children. On 3 January 1937, 252 people were evacuated on including 67 women and 49 children. On 13 January 1937, 212 were evacuated by of which were 36 were women and 22 were children. Another 536 people were on three other ships where total numbers of women were not recorded. Women in rearguard battalions often met daily to practice weapons training, marching and drilling. Many also received specialized training in the use of machine guns. Union de Muchachas was a communist organized rearguard women's only battalion in Madrid that fought on the front line starting on 8 November 1936. The battalion included two thousand women aged fourteen to twenty-five who had been training since July 1936, when the Civil War began. Positioned at Segovia Bridge and near Getafe on the Carabanchel front and representing the bulk of the Republican forces in those positions, Union de Muchachas fighters were among the last to retreat. Women's only battalions existed behind the front lines as rearguard support in defense of their cities. Barcelona had such a battalion organized by PSUC. In Mallorca, there was the Rosa Luxemburg Battalion that saw action on the front in defense of the city. Madrid had the Union de Muchachas which served on the front in November 1936 in the Battle for Madrid. Art continued during the Civil War. Mar√≠a Zambrano was one of several editors, the only woman, of the art magazine, Hora de Espa√±a. They moved their base to Valencia in 1936, following the Republican government from Madrid there as they believed it was important to continue Spain's intellectual period even during the war. When Valencia fell, Zambrano moved with the group to Barcelona in the fall of 1938 where she helped published the magazine's final edition in 1939. Its final edition that year was limited as the printing press was destroyed mid-run.  December 1936  In the last half of 1936, milicianas were not considered exceptional; they served as comrades alongside men in separate or mixed gender battalions. This was in large part because many of the milicianas were motivated to fight because their own revolutionary beliefs: they believed their involvement could change the course of the war, and bring about a new revolution in thinking in society. A few women fought because they were following husbands, fathers or sons into battle. This group though represented a very small minority, with the majority fighting for ideological reasons. While the national branches of Communist Party supported sending foreign fighters to Spain to fight in the Civil War in the International Brigades, they often opposed their female members from going. When they sometimes agreed to send determined women to Spain, it was often in support roles as reporters or propagandists. The party apparatus in Spain then actively worked to keep women away from the front. On 25 December 1936, the Generalitat de Catalu√±a made abortion legal for the first time in the history of Spain following a decree from the Health Department. The anarchist-dominated Health Department then followed this up in March 1937 with regulations for hospitals and clinics about how to conduct abortions. The same government also for the first time provided government sponsored information and access to birth control, coupling it with information and treatment for venereal disease. During the Civil War, broader problems that pre-dated it continued for PSOE, with socialist groups tending to lack female participation in the early months of the war. When socialist women wanted to get involved, they either had to do so through socialist youth organizations or they had to switch allegiances to the communist, who were more accepting of women and more likely to put them into leadership positions. During the winter of 1936, the Republican government tried to formally convert militias into units in their armed forces. Until this point, women had joined militias affiliated with various political parties and unions.  1937  Women also came from abroad to fight as part of the International Brigades, with their total numbers documented at between 400 and 700 women. Many women first traveled to Paris, before going by boat or train to fight. A 1937 agreement designed to stop foreign intervention eventually largely put a stop to recruitment to the International Brigades for both men and women. The Women's Aid Committee was formed during the Civil War at the direction of the Minister of Defense. It was largely staffed by members of the Women Against War. Their activities included mobilizing women into large protest. One such protest demanded that men deemed non-essential by the government were sent to the front, with women taking their places in the workforce. The organization held its first national conference in 1937 in Valencia, drawing women from across Spain who represented all classes and leftist ideologies. The Nationalists using rape by Berber forces as a way of bringing women and children into compliance was so problematic, that the British who were scared of allowing Republican refugees in lest they spread the contagion of Communism in the country, finally allowed 3,889 Basque children and 219 female Basque teaches in 1937 to board and and head to Britain. The British Government feared being made complicit in rape.  January 1937  In January 1937 at the Battle of Jarama, Republican forces were near the point of retreating until three Spanish milicianas inspired the men they were serving with to hold fast. The women, manning a machine gun post, refused to retreat.  March 1937  Socialist women were more active abroad than at home in their opposition to the Spanish Civil War. Belgian women socialists were opposed to their socialist party's neutrality during the Spanish Civil War. To counter this, these women socialist were active in trying to evacuate refugees. Among their accomplishments were evacuating 450 Basque children to Belgium in March 1937. With the assistance of the Belgian Red Cross and Communist's Red Aid, socialist women organized the placement of 4,000 Spanish refugees. Guadalajara, where women were told to leave the front in March 1937 Both foreign and domestic media printed images of these female fighters on Spain's front lines as boldly breaking gender norms. Initially, they presented problems for some people in Spain, as the country had very traditional ideas about gender roles. While Republicans became more accepting of them, this started to change yet again by December 1936 when the Government of the Second Republic started using the slogan, \\"Men to the Front, Women to the Home Front.\\" By March 1937, this attitude had spread to the front lines, where militia women, over their own objections, were withdrawn or placed into secondary roles. Women were told to leave the front in Guadalajara in March 1937. Following the battle, many were load into cars and taken to support positions further behind the lines. A few refused to leave, and their fate is uncertain though friends suspected most died in combat. Expelled soldiers included Leopoldine Kokes of the International Group of the Durruti Column. Some demobilized women left the front, and joined women's columns on the home front, in defense of cities like Madrid and Barcelona. When Juan Negr√≠n became the head of the Republican armed forces in May 1937, women's time in combat ended as he continued efforts to regularize Republican forces. Following their removal from the front, milicianas and women in general stopped featuring in Republican propaganda. Visually, they returned to their lives before the war, where their primary role was behind the scenes at home. Communists and anarchists columns attracted the most women among all the political groups on the Republican front. Stories about POUM militants became more well known as they were more likely to have published their memories or had better contacts with international media.  May 1937  Girls hiding during a Nationalist bombing of Madrid in 1937 During the Second Republic and during the initial stages of the Civil War, there was a social and economic revolution in women's rights, especially in areas like Catalonia. Because of the nature of war, many reforms were sporadically and inconsistently implemented, and advances made during the latter half of 1936 were largely erased by May 1937. From February to May 1937, there were many women led protests over the subsistence living created as a result of high food prices and bread shortages that came into great effect following the sixth anniversary of the Republic. A woman in Barcelona waits during the Spanish Civil War Working-class women in Barcelona would often queue for hours for bread in 1937, only to find none was available. This sometimes would lead to rioting, which CNT leadership then worked hard to fault each other over in an attempt to avoid responsibility for the bread shortage. The problem was compounded by the fact that middle and upper-class people in Barcelona were readily buying bread on the black market. One riot occurred on 6 May 1937, when women looted vans full of oranges at the Barcelona port. When this aspect was brought to attention, CNT offered sexist excuses as to why working-class women were unable to buy bread. The result was that ordinary working-class women in the city often turned on anarchist women, and blaming them despite the anarchist women not being involved in CNT leadership. Mujeres Libres, CNT's women's arm, addressed this problem by taking action into their own hands, and staging assaults on markets to provide food for other women. Food riots would become a common feature in Barcelona during the Civil War. One of the few publicly socialist identified women in this period was Mar√≠a Elisa Garc√≠a, who served as a miliciana with the Popular Militias as a member Asturias Battalion Somoza company. She fought with the Battalion at the Lugones front, and later in the Basque mountains. She was killed in combat in the mountains of M√∫gica on 9 May 1937.  May Days of 1937  In the lead up to the May Days events, Communists aligned with the Soviet Union had largely taken control of the ports, where most of the support materials and relief aid coming in for distribution around the country were from the Soviet Union. They soon became a de facto police force, and were already working to undermine anarchists.\\"Rescuing Memory: the Humanist Interview with Noam Chomsky\\" The Humanist TheHumanist.com N. p., 2016.

Personajes famosos. ABC.es.  June 1937  Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista (POUM) was the dissident communist party during this period. Their engagement for women involved trying to create specific female sub-organizations for them to join. In June 1937, the Franco regime and the Communists in control of Republican areas both declared POUM illegal, leading to the dissolution of the group. Uni√≥n Democr√°tica de Catalu√±a (UDC) saw a communist hegemony emerge by late 1937. They moved more away from their center right policies of their founding, and more towards positions supported by PSUC. In the Republican offensive against Nationalist held Teruel from December 1937 to February 1938, brigades on the ground tried to honor Indalecio Prieto's call to protect civilians, and particularly women in children. They sometimes stopped shelling buildings when people inside made clear they were non-combatant women and children. The reality of the offensive and life on the front lines meant many of those civilians had nothing. Women would often risk their lives to loot recently shelled buildings. They needed furniture to burn to melt snow for water, to cook and to provide some heat. Many women, on both sides in the city, died of starvation during the month long battle.  August 1937  Location of the province of Salamanca. Mart√≠n Veloz led a column of Bloque Agrario, Acci√≥n Popular and Falange members on a purge of Republican forces in 1937 in villages in the Salamanca area like El Pedroso, La Orbada, Cantalpino and Villoria. Republican men were shot, while Republican women were raped, and then had their heads shaved before being paraded through their villages. The area had not had any major uprising prior to this by Republican forces. Mart√≠n Veloz was part of a group that on 24 August 1937 that murdered twenty-two men and one woman in Cantalpino. Following this, the group then raped many women, and shaved the heads of around one hundred women before making them parade through the streets.  September 1937  Foreign observers covering the war often wrote about women's bravery on the front, including saying they took enemy fire better than many of the men they fought alongside. One example of such bravery happened in Cerro Muriano in September 1937, where Republican army forces from Ja√©n and Valencia fled the front while the small militia force from Alcoy, which included two women, withstood a Nationalist bombardment.  October 1937  Argentina Garc√≠a was on the front in October 1937 in San Esteban de las Cruces. The communist's bravery in battle was recognized with a promotion to Captain in her Astruias Battalion.  1938  The first edition of Mujeres Libres, a magazine published by the organization of the same name A girl with her doll in 1938 after a bombing Mujeres Libres became one of the most important women's anarchist organizations during the Civil War. Their Civil War ranks were aided by women moving over from CNT to participation in their organization. The organization's importance was a result of the activities they were carrying out. They included running educational programming, and trying to increase the literacy rate among women. They were also organizing collective kitchens, parent controlled daycare centers, and providing prenatal and infant health information to expecting parents. Mujeres Libres had over 20,000 members by 1938. Mujeres Libres was also publishing a journal of the same name in 1938. Writings found in it focused on personal autonomy, the creation of female identities, and self- esteem. It also often addressed the conflicts in identity between being a woman and being a mother, and how women should navigate their identities as maternal figures. The October 1938 CNT congress in Barcelona saw Mujeres Libres locked out, with the fifteen women strong delegation barred from entering. Women had previously been allowed to attend, but only as representatives of other, mixed gendered anarchist organizations. A women's only organization was not tolerated. The women protested this, and would not get an answer until an extraordinary meeting of CNT on 11 February 1939. When their answer came, it was that \\"an independent women's organization would undermine the overall strength of the libertarian movement and inject and element of disunity that would have negative consequences for the development of working-class interests and the liberarian movement on the whole.\\"  1939  A plaque in the cemetery honoring Las Trece Rosas Seven girls under the age of twenty-one were out of a group of thirteen women executed as part of a larger group of fifty-six prisoners in Madrid on 5 August 1939. The group became known as the Trece Rosas, and had all belonged to the United Socialist Youth (JSU). Casado Junta had gained access to JSU membership roles, and then left them to be found by supporters of Franco. This facilitated the arrest of the Trece Rosas, because the fascist had names and details of JSU members. Pregnant women could be subject to beatings and torture. Some were given electric shocks to their nipples, lower genitalia and ears. For those who survived this, they were often plagued with mental illness and headaches that lasted years. Nursing mothers in prison often had to deal with unsanitary conditions and the presence of rats. In some prisons, like Ventas, water for toilets and sinks was turned off. Ten to fifteen infant corpses a day were often be found in the Ventas prison, with children dying from meningitis. Julia Manzanal was arrested in Madrid in early 1939, right after she had given birth. As a result, she was allowed to take her infant daughter with her. The baby lived only ten months before succumbing to meningitis. Mujeres Libres folded by the end of the Civil War.

As with all members of the genus Nothobranchius, they show extreme life-history adaptations: their embryos survive by entering a three or four month long diapause, within eggs that have a very hard chorion and are resistant to desiccation and hypoxia. When the habitats dry up, the adult fish die and the eggs survive encased in the clay during the dry season. Type locality and type material The type locality is stated as \\"Bukama, Shaba province, southeastern Za√Øre (09¬∞ 12≈Ω S-25¬∞ 51≈Ω E)\\". The lectotype of the taxon is reposited as \\"MRAC 50016\\" at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium, together with 23 paratypes. The type was collected by the Belgian zoologist and colleague of Max Poll, Paul Brien (1894-1975), who is honoured in its specific name.

For Republican women, Francoist Spain was a double loss, as the new regime first took away the limited political power and identities as women which they had won during the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939), and it secondly forced them back into the confines of their homes. Motherhood would become the primary social function of women in Francoist Spain. Feminism in Spain would be co-opted by the regime, encouraging not liberation, but instead the engagement of pious domesticity. The Castilian Association of Homemakers and Consumers was unique in this period, for trying to co-opt the regime to support women's liberation from the inside. Some women in the Communist Party of Spain would support violence against the state through armed resistance. Other women found themselves in prisons. Pregnant women in prison often had their children kidnapped by the state, in order for them to be placed in families that supported the government line. Many Republican women went into exile in this period, with a number of them working to support other women in the same position.  Background  Francoist Spain was a Pseudo-fascist state whose ideology rejected what it considered the inorganic democracy of the Second Republic. It was an embrace of organic democracy, defined as a reassertion of traditional Spanish Roman Catholic values that served as a counterpoint to the Communism of the Soviet Union during the same period. It came into exist in 1939 following the end of the Spanish Civil War. Misogyny and heteronormativity where linchpins of fascism in Spain, where the philosophy revolved around patria and fixed gender roles that praised the role of strong male leadership. For women, the end of the Civil War represented a loss for women, and an introduction of a repressive regime specifically targeting them. The fascist ideology entered as a framework to justify Franco's actions in overthrowing the Second Republic with a grounding in support of Falange espa√±ola, which was created by Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1934, with Franco assuming leadership of the party in April 1937. Franco used his status as head of Falange to become Caudillo, fashioning himself as a political and spiritual leader who led the country in a Crusade against the secular forces of the Second Republic. The regime sought legitimacy through propaganda efforts, involving reclaiming elements of Spain's past. This included citing of Jer√≥nimo Merola's 1587 work, Rep√∫blica original sacada del cuerpo humano. It also borrowed from the works of Spanish intellectuals including Joaquin Costa, Angel Ganivet, and Jos√© Ortega y Gasset. It also tried to tie in modern Catholicism, and works such as Pius XII's Mystici corporis Christi published in 1943. This process was part of an effort to create the perception of a new Golden Age for Spain. Spain was described during the mid-1950s as an example of the Leonine Ideal, and had support from Pope Pius XII in Rome. Pius XII was anointed Pope only a month before the end of the Spanish Civil War. Franco sent a telegram to Pius XII to congratulate him on his election, with the telegram being published in the daily monarchist newspaper ABC. Both Franco and Pius XII were vehemently anti-atheist Communist in their world views.  Timeline  The truth of the Spanish women's experience in this period is not one experience, but many that continually juxtapose upon each other where various stories about their experiences have been highly politicized.  1930s  Women of the Secci√≥n Femenina deliver food to needy women in Guipuscoa (1937). All the adults do the Roman salute. As a consequence of the Spanish Civil War, over a million Spaniards died, another million were forced into exile and an unknown number disappeared. Franco's regime would continue Civil War based reprisals until the end of World War II, with an estimated 200,000 people being executed by the regime or died in prison in that period for their alleged Republican links. Adolf Hitler provided support for Franco during the Spanish Civil War. In the first days of the Francoist period, it was a crime to be a mother, daughter, sister or wife of a \\"red\\", and this could be punished with long prison sentences or death. Women were subjected to economic reprisals by the regime. In Galicia, around 14,600 people were victims of such reprisals. Former Republican A Gudi√±a mayor Florinda Ortega P√©rez was one such victim. The government confiscated her business and all her property, along with fining her 10,000 pesetas. This bankrupted her and forced her into exile. Eugenics in Spain in the late 1930s and through to the 1940s was not based on race, but instead on people's political alignment with the regime. Ricardo Campos said, \\"the racial question during the Franco era is complex.\\" He went on to say, \\"despite the similarities of the Franco regime with the Italian and German fascism and the interest that the eugenics provoked, the strong Catholicism of the regime prevented its defense of the eugenic policies that were practiced in the Nazi Germany.\\" Campos went on to say, \\"it was very difficult to racialize the Spanish population biologically because of the mixture that had been produced historically.\\" Vallejo-N√°gera in his 1937 work, \\"Eugenics of the Hispanicity and Regeneration of the Race\\" defined Hispanicness around spirituality and religion. The goal was the \\"strengthening psychologically\\" of the phenotype. Because Catholicism was opposed to negative eugenics, the only way to fight the degradation was through repression of abortion, euthanasia and contraception. Doctors in Francoist Spain had two roles: to be moral protectors of Spanish reproduction and to provide science based medical services. This put male doctors in charge of women's birth control. When medical doctors in the Second Republic and early Francoist period defended birth control, it was on the eugenics grounds that it protected the health of both women and children, especially as it related to the spread of genetic disease and the spread of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. Most of the resistance in Spain during the early Franco period was a result of guerrillas, who coordinated their activities in the interior both with political militants in exile and with militants in prison. Most of Spain's militant women who remained in Spain were in prison or had gone underground where they served as important figures in coordinating activities between all three groups. Prisons in this case proved invaluable for many militant women as they allowed them to rebuild their activist networks or create new networks. They were also one of the biggest sources of female resistance to the Franco regime by exercising daily resistance behind prison walls.  1940s  Spanish flag can be seen in the background. The 1940s and 1950s were a dark period in Spanish history, where the country was still recovering from the effects of the Spanish Civil War, where the economy was poor and people suffered a huge number of deprivations as a result of the loss of life and the repressive nature of the regime which sought to vanquish any and all remaining Republican support by going after anyone who had been affiliated with or expressed any sympathies towards the Second Republic. The end of World War II meant Franco felt threatened by the extinction of other European fascist regimes on the continent. To ensure his and the regime's continued existence, he took more further steps to purge outward fascist elements. This resulted in increased lack of coherence for the regime's fascist based ideology. Steps included referring to the government as autoritarismo or r√©gimen conservador de desarrollo (\\"conservative regime of development\\"), merging fascist organizations like Falange with more traditional, Catholic organizations to repress Falange's more overt fascist elements, and by not trying to portray the regime as aggressive towards other nations. Bathers in San Sebasti√°n (1940). Most women in the 1940s were not politically active, involved with guerrilla groups or militants. They were women dealing with hardship, poverty and the imposition of gender norms that imposed on their every day lives. Their process of coping and surviving often made their personal activities intersect with activism as they subtly challenged the regime and limits imposed by the regime. Women in the Cortes Espa√±olas provided negligible contributions to the body during the 1940s and 1950s, these women would be more influential during the 1960s and 1970s as Spain's economy changed and broader Spanish culture demanded contradictory and complex things from women as the regime tried to keep the changing culture in line with its fascist ideology. During the Franco period, families of dead and disappeared Republicans were prohibited from mourning publicly. They could not retrieve bodies. They could not give them headstones. They could not wear mourning garb. They could not cry about the loss of their loved ones in public. All grief was only allowed in the private domain, and often centered around photographs the family had of their dead and missing. Photos became a source of comfort, dignity and resistance. They were passed down from generation so families would not forget their histories. Women were generally not part of the founding of guerrilla groups operating in the 1940s. They were brought in later, as part of a disaffected class, through personal and political contacts. Almost all women involved with guerrilla groups were from rural areas and had family involved. This differed from the previous period, where many fighters came from the middle class and urban areas. One group women belonged to was Agrupaci√≥n guerrillera de Levante y Arag√≥n (AGLA). In the 1940s, women were barred from a number of professions. These included being a magistrate, diplomat, notary, customs officer, stock broker, and prison doctor. This was because women's primary job was to be a homemaker. From the 1940s to the 1980s, families, religious figures, strangers could all report women to the authorities for violating female morality. These women then could then be imprisoned without a trial in reformatories. Examples of reasons women were incarcerated included \\"having gone with the comparsas of film artist Marisol\\" and \\"not obeying her mother. She likes the street a lot and does not want to work.\\" In Barcelona during the 1940s, women had to be accompanied by men such as fathers, brothers or husbands if they wanted to be out on the street at night; they could not go out unaccompanied. Internal Spanish women migrants found life in Spain difficult during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Francoist policy dictated they remain in the home. Unlike their husbands who could new develop social connections through outside employment, immigrant women were isolated having left behind their previous social support networks. During the 1940s, the number of women in M√°laga for crimes related to food acquisition sentenced to Caser√≥n de la Goleta increased. The city itself had a severe food shortage and typhus was common. Women would get to the prison and happily suck on orange peels because that was more than was available on the streets of M√°laga. The prison would not protect them from typhus and other diseases which continued to spread throughout the prison where women were put six to a room designed for two. During the 1940s and 1950s, Francoism said prisoners could be redeemed by the Church. Consequently, promulgating the faith was often made a condition of release. One rule required that for prisoners with children to receive subsidies, they needed to be married. As a result, many women got married behind bars and had their children baptized as Roman Catholics. The most popular novels written by women in the 1940s and 1950s were romance novels (), outselling all other types of women's writings. These were not serious literary works, but were intended for mass consumption. The 1940, 1950s and 1960s were a period where the broader male dominated literary establishment refused to take women's literary efforts seriously. Francisco Garc√≠a Pav√≥n asked in an interview about women's writings, \\"Are women's arms too weak for the oars of a great novel?\\" to which he basically answered yes. Consequently, there was very little serious criticism of women's writings and an erasure of their efforts in the immediate post war period. When their works were criticized, they were often compared only to works of other women in the past and found wanting. Some criticism in literary publications would comment on a female writers appearance, while taking very little note of her actual writings. When good women writers like Carmen Nonell were recognized, they were recognized in ways that sought to erase their gender.  1950s  Jos√© Antonio was the most powerful woman in the Francoist bureaucracy. Carmen Polo, Franco's wife attends a bullfight in San Sebasti√°n in 1950. Until the mid-1950s, Spain was crippled by an economic crisis coupled with a government imposed repressive society and culture that demanded uniformity and compliance. Starting in the 1950s, Spain started adopting a more consumerist economy. This would continue on into the 1960s and would play a role in introducing Spanish women to the new modern Western woman. This introduction would result in the eschewing of the concept of True Catholic Womanhood. The 1950s saw mass migration of people from the countryside to the city. The regime began to adapt their ideology to deal with this new urban reality. Many women made such moves with the hope that they could be more anonymous and avoid accusations of small towns of being \\"reds\\". Prohibitions against the sale of contraception in Andalusia in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were largely ineffective as women had various means to try to limit the number of children they had. This was especially true for women engaging in sex outside of marriage at a time when that practice, along with having children when single, were highly condemned by the government. Women were willing to take risks to have sex for pleasure by using some form of birth control. For many married Andalusian women in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, there was a certain fatalism about the fact they would inevitably become mothers. It was difficult for them to try to negotiate family planning with their spouses. Starting in the 1950s, foreign movies in Spain presented women with images of beautiful and glamorous women who had their own agency. This image conflicted with the state presented image, which demanded women surrender agency to their husbands and fathers and become mothers. These movies also served to bring Spanish women out of their international isolation. They also helped feed a Spanish consumerist culture that challenged the regime. During the 1950s, tourists started to visit Spanish beaches en masse. They wore mini-skirts and bikinis, and played an important role in changing Spanish women's perceptions of other women in that these clothes did not signify a woman was a prostitute. The 1950s saw a diminishment of the importance of the Women's Section as their role in shoring up the economy and producing propaganda for national unity were less needed. In response, it switched to become more clearly a social welfare arm of the state. The organization lost much of its political influence and position within the Francoist structure. Its survival was largely because of their involvement in education and no other organization offered women of this period the same level of opportunities. Pilar Primo de Rivera was viewed by many inside the regime as a critical player in successfully encouraging Franco to relax restrictions for women during the 1950s and 1960s.  1960s  Pilar Careaga (depicted in 1932), the first woman with an engineer title in Spain. After rising within Falange, she was designed as mayor of Bilbao in 1969, the first woman mayor in Francoism. By the 1960s, Francoist Spain had changed its definition of Catholic womanhood. Women were no longer only biological organisms existing for the sole purpose of procreation, but as beings for whom Spanish cultural meaning rested. Despite being contraception being illegal, by the mid-1960s, Spanish women had access to the contraceptive pill. Women could be prescribed the pill by their doctors if they were married and could make a case that they had a gynecological problem which the pill could fix, but this reason could not be a desire to avoid being pregnant. The 1960s marked an economic shift in Spain, as the country moved from an agrarian based economy of the rural countryside to an industrial based economy of the cities. This necessitated the introduction of women on a large scale into the Spanish workforce. The 1960s saw the same inequalities of the past, with most of the economic gains going towards the bourgeois while the poor were left destitute and unable to strike for better working conditions. Parts of rural Castile and still lacked roads, electricity and running water. Starting in the 1960s, women's groups and feminists organizations began to emerge. Women's associations were tolerated by the regime but were not completely legal. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Women's Section aided in raising expectations of what was possible for women to accomplish by taking personal responsibility for their actions. By the end of the 1960s, the destiny of women in Spain was changing as women increasingly began to express their dissatisfaction with state imposed patriarchy. Their dissatisfaction would play a large role in the later collapse of the regime following Franco's death.  1970s  The high- profile quarrels among leftist women and increasingly involvement of male dominated political organizations led to the creation in the 1970s of third- wave radical feminism in Spain, that was both similar and notably dissimilar to their American counterparts of the same name by being more explicitly socialist and politically focused on class in their orientation. These women would found Partido Feminista (PF) and Seminario Colectivo Feminista, an organization founded in 1976 as a result in a split inside PF. Socialist Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores and Communist Comisiones Obreras were the two leading underground clandestine unions during the 1960s and 1970s.Ballester, David (2003), Els homes sense nom. L‚Äôexili i la clandestinitat de la UGT de Catalunya (1939-1976). Barcelona: Viena Edicions-Fundaci√≥ Josep Comaposada. Women were involved with UGT as part of their opposition to the regime. Women were arrested and tortured for their involvement in the Francoist period. Security officers would insult women, questioning their status as both women and mothers. In the Basque Country, both Basque and Spanish women would remain socially isolated until the 1970s when younger women began to push their way inside the dominant culture. This included going to bars and restaurants. Female internal migrants in the Basque country began to be accepted as more Basque than those who had lived in the region for generation, in part because they were more willing to become politically engaged on discussions of Basque nationalism. This political awakening also enabled these women to become more active in efforts to counter the regime. Because abortion was illegal in Spain, during the 1970s, Spanish women who could afford it went to London to get abortions. Between 1974 and 1988, 195,993 Spanish women traveled to England and Wales to get an abortion. Women also went to the Netherlands in this period to have abortions. France was not an option, as at the time it required women who had abortions to be French residents and have resided in the country for at least three months. Women then needed to wait a week to reflect before they could get an abortion. An unknown number of women went to North Africa and Portugal for abortions. During the early and mid-1970s, the Supreme Court of Spain received a large number of appeals from women over their adultery convictions. A man with the initials of MDL was convicted on 15 October 1976, and successfully was granted her appeal a year and a half later. The Supreme Court said in granting the appeal, \\"nothing is said in the judgment appealed regarding the fact that the defendant had knowledge of the woman's marital status.\\" Another woman who had a relationship was less fortunate, with the Supreme Court dismissing her appeal despite her claim that she had permission of her husband. The court said in rejecting the appeal, \\"there was no consent, because although the husband knew the behavior of his wife, he could not exercise the action while the guilty lived abroad.\\" A man and a woman appealed their 14 September 1973 adultery conviction on the grounds of marital separation on the part of the woman. The Supreme Court rejected this, saying, \\"as long as the marriage is not annulled or the current legality is modified, the marriage bond subsists and its ethical and fidelity duties remain.\\" Divorce in the late Franco period and early transition period was available via ecclesiastical tribunals. These courts could nullify marriage for a fee. Consequently, they were mostly only available to the rich. The Civil Courts would only be involved in separation procedures at the provisional level. The Catholic Church was actively opposed to civil divorce in the mid and late 1970s.  Employment  Women who had been behind Republican lines found themselves locked out from a number of professions just because of where they had lived. This included civil service jobs, teaching positions, journalism jobs, and places in professional organizations. It was not until later labor shortages that laws around employment opportunities for women changed. These laws passed in 1958 and 1961 provided a very narrow opportunity, but an opportunity, for women to be engaged in non-domestic labor outside the household.  Gender roles  The end of the Civil War, and the victory of Nationalist forces, saw the return of traditional gender roles to Spain. This included the unacceptability of women serving in combat roles in the military. Where gender roles were more flexible, it was often around employment issues where women felt an economic necessity to make their voices heard. It was also more acceptable for women to work outside the home, though the options were still limited to roles defined as more traditionally female. This included working as nurses, or in soup kitchens or orphanages. Overall though, the end of the Civil War proved a double loss for Republican women, as it first took away the limited political power and identities as women they had won during the Second Republic and it secondly forced them back into the confines of their homes. With strict gender norms back in place, women who had found acceptable employment prior and during the Civil War found employment opportunities even more difficult in the post war period. Teachers who had worked for Republican schools often could not find employment. Gender norms were further reinforced by Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange. Opportunities to work, study or travel required taking classes on cooking, sewing, childcare and the role of women before they were granted. If women did not take or pass these classes, they were denied these opportunities.  Role in the family  Motherhood became the primary social function of women in Francoist Spain. Still, while motherhood played this critical societal role, it was one the regime only wanted to see perpetuated among those who shared in their political ideology. Children of mothers with leftist or Republican leanings were often removed from their care in order to prevent mothers from sharing their ideology with their offspring. A law passed on 30 March 1940 meant Republican women could keep their children with them in prison until the child turned three years old. At this point, children were then put into state care to prevent the contagion of Republican thinking from spreading. The number of children removed from Republican mothers between 1944 and 1954 was 30,960. These children were not allowed to remain in contact with their families, and many found themselves in centers run by Auxilio Social. When mothers were released from prisons, they were often watched to make sure they were good mothers as defined by the state. Actively surveilled, many women lost custody of new children they had. Republican mothers abroad addressed the problem of specifically being targeted by Franco's regime by created the Uni√≥n de Mujeres Espa√±olas (UME) in France. The purpose of the organization was to legitimize political activity of mothers as being part of the broader efforts of \\"female consciousness.\\" UME published a magazine called Mujeres Antifascistas Espa√±olas. The publication linked Republican women in exile with those in Spain, including some who were in prison. It honored women's roles as front line combatants, and suggested the special role of motherhood made their voices more valuable when it came to speaking out against the problems of the Franco regime. This contrasted to the beliefs of Spanish Communist women in exile, which suggested mothers in this period should fade into the background, serving in roles that supported single women and men who could be more visible in the struggle against Franco. Communists emphasized a traditional view of motherhood espoused by Franco.  Feminism  Isabel the Catholic in Alcala de Henares. Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange worked to depict feminism as a form of depravity. It associated feminism with drug abuse and other evils plaguing society. State supported feminism, expressed through Secci√≥n Femenina, offered Isabel the Catholic and Teresa of Avila as symbols for Spanish women to look up. They had first been used by Francoist women during the Civil War, and reminded women that their role was to become mothers and to engage in pious domesticity. Secci√≥n Femenina did things like creating agricultural and adult schools, sports centers and libraries. They organized cultural groups and discussion groups. They published their own magazine. They worked to preserve traditional rural life. All of this was done with the underlying goal of encouraging traditional womanhood, of remaining in the home as a good daughter, and later as a good wife and mother. The pride that women got in completing these domestic tasks associated with Secci√≥n Femenina's teachings has been described by Guiliana Di Febo as Christian feminism. Some feminists in Franco's Spain tried to subvert government goals and change policy by becoming directly involved in government institutions. The Castilian Association of Homemakers and Consumers was one organization that attracted the type of feminist that believed that change should come from within. They became regime accepted vehicles for female dissent.  Women's rights  The ideological pillars for a New Spain in the Franco era became national syndicalism and national Catholicism. The Franco period saw an extreme regression in the rights of women. The situation for women was more regressive than that of women in Nazi Germany under Hitler. The legal status for women in many cases reverted to that stipulated in the Napoleonic Code that had first been installed in Spanish law in 1889. The post Civil War period saw the return of laws that effectively made wards of women. They were dependent on husbands, fathers and brothers to work outside the house. Women needed permission to do an array of basic activities, including applying for a job, opening a bank account or going on a trip. The law during the Franco period allowed husbands to killed their wives if they caught them in the act of adultery. In March 1938, Franco suppressed the laws regarding civil matrimony and divorce that had been enacted by the Second Republic. The 1954 Ley de Vagos y Maleantes saw further repression directed at women, specifically those who were lesbians. The law saw many lesbians committed, put into psychiatric institutions and given electroshock therapy.  Political organizations and activist  The Communist Party of Spain became the dominant clandestine political organization in Spain following the end of the Civil War. It would retain this position until the death of Franco saw PSOE replace it. Women were involved with the party, helping to organize covert armed resistance by serving in leadership roles and assisting in linking up political leaders in exile with those active on the ground in Spain. During the later parts of the war and at its conclusion, some women from POUM were coerced into making false confessions in Moscow courtrooms, and then sent to Soviet prisons. Their major crime was being Trotskyites. It was only during the 1950s and 1960s that some of those women involved with POUM and Trotskyite purged began to re-evaluate their role in them; their change of hearts only occurred after Stalinist Communism lost its prestige among leftist circles.  Prison  By the end of the war, the Nationalist run women's only Las Ventas Model prison in Madrid had over 14,000 women. Many of these women in prison were raped by guards and were pregnant. This had swollen the size of the prison to include a further 12,000 Republican child prisoners. From there, at the orders of Antonio Vallejo N√°gera, these children were removed from their mothers and put into orphanages in order to prevent them being contaminated by \\"Marxist fanaticism.\\" Mar√≠a Topete Fern√°ndez was part of prison leadership at the Prison for Nursing Mothers in Madrid. Held up as a model for being the first of its kind in Europe, the prison had problems with infant mortality. While the Law of Maternal and Infant Health in June 1941 reduced infant deaths by a small fraction, imprisoned Republican women would not see improved rates until 1943, and significant improvement until 1952 when the prison's rationing system was abandoned.  Milicianas  The end of the Civil War, and the victory of Nationalist forces, saw the return of traditional gender roles to Spain. This included the unacceptability of women serving in combat roles in the military. After the war, many milicianas faced difficulties. This included the general population being subjected to a propaganda war that ridiculed their involvement in the conflict. At the same time, the new government sought them out to put them in prison or torture them. Many fighters were also illiterate, and found this to be restrict later activities. This was coupled with restrictions placed on some when in exile in France that limited their opportunities. For those who remained politically active, they had to deal with open sexism in the Communist Party and in anarchist circles. Some milicianas never retired. They instead continued active violence against the state as part of communist and anarchist cells, using terrorism like tactics. This included bombing Guardia Civil positions, robbing banks and attacking offices of Falanage. Women involved with this resistance effort included Victoria Pujolar, Adelaida Abarca and Angelita Ramis. These women, and women like them, served as go betweens for exiled leaders in France and those on the ground in Spain. They worked with Communist Party leaders to plan attacks.  Exiles  Following the collapse of Republic in 1938 and the establishment of recognition of the Nationalist government in February 1939, many women went into exile. Women in refugee camps in France often found themselves in squalid conditions. Pregnant women had few facilities to give birth and they were often poorly suited. Swiss aid worker Elizabeth Eidenbenz arrived to the camps on the frontier in December 1939, and immediately set about improving maternity services. In the period between December 1939 and February 1944, the facilities she helped to establish saw 597 births of Spanish, Polish and Jewish women. Eidenbenz assisted many of the women in getting papers and visas for themselves and their children. Despite better facilities, many things could not be done including cesarian sections. As a consequence, information morality rates remained low, with many newborns dying within weeks of their birth.  Women's media, writing and art  Margarita Nelken, Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Sierra and Carmen de Burgos had all been pre-Civil War feminist writers. Following the war, their work was subjected to strict censorship. Spanish feminists in Spain in the post Civil War period often needed to be active in exile. Works produced by these writers including Nada by Carmen Laforet in 1945 and La mujer nueva in 1955, Primera memoria by Ana Mar√≠a Matute in 1960. Writings of some foreign feminists did find their way to Spain, including the Le deuxi√®me sex published in French in 1947 by Simone de Beauvoir. Inside Spain, well connected, often aristocratic Spanish feminists were sometimes able to publish their works for domestic consumption by 1948. This includes works by Mar√≠a Lafitte, Countess of Campo Alanaga, and Lil√≠ √Ålvarez. Works by Republican pre-war feminists like Rosa Chacel and Mar√≠a Zambrano, who continued to write from exile, also saw their works smuggled into Spain. Following the war, many women artists went into exile because of there leftist leanings. Those who remained often had to deal with censorship of their work by the Franco government. British Surrealist Leonora Carrington traveled to Spain in 1940, seeking to find her partner Max Ernst who had left Germany was on the run from the Gestapo. Her trip happened only months after the Civil War officially ended, and the arrest of Ernst precipitated a mental breakdown that eventually saw her put into an asylum in Santander after her father and the British government agreed. While there, she was regularly dosed with Cardiazol and restrained naked over a six-month period. She was eventually released, and then went to Lisbon.

He rose from private to major during the First World War, and was temporary commander of the 25th Battalion on several occasions. He subsequently joined the Commonwealth Public Service and was posted to the Territory of New Guinea, serving as government secretary from 1923 and as acting administrator on a number of occasions. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942 and is listed among those killed in the sinking of the SS Montevideo Maru. Early life Page was born on 8 August 1888 in Grafton, New South Wales, the eighth of eleven children born to Mary (n√©e Cox) and Charles Page. His older brothers included Methodist missionary Rodger Page and Australian prime minister Sir Earle Page. Page was educated at Grafton Public School. He joined the Department of Public Instruction and worked as a schoolteacher from 1904 to 1913. He also completed further studies at Sydney Teachers' College (1908‚Äì09) and the University of Sydney (1911‚Äì13; part-time). In 1913, Page joined the Commonwealth Public Service as a clerk in the Taxation Office, stationed at Lismore. He later worked in the electoral branch of the Department of Home Affairs. First World War Page enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in February 1915, with the rank of private. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 25th Battalion two months later. He arrived at Gallipoli in September, by which time he had been promoted lieutenant. During a nighttime reconnaissance mission on 29 October, Page and another soldier disabled two Ottoman soldiers and threw bombs into enemy trenches. He was wounded in action by enemy shelling in December, but was able to rejoin his unit in Egypt the following month. The 25th Battalion arrived in France in March 1916, and Page was promoted captain in May. On 28 June, he led a successful raiding party of 70 men near Messines, during which he was wounded in the spine. He was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for \\"conspicuous gallantry during a raid on the enemy's trenches\\" showing \\"great coolness and courage\\". Page spent several months recovering in England, but rejoined his unit in November 1916. In 1917, he was detached to the AIF's administrative headquarters in London, where he oversaw military voting in the 1917 Australian federal election. Page was promoted major in July 1917 and became second-in-command of the 25th Battalion. He was briefly captured by Germans in October, but managed to escape. He was the temporary commander of the battalion on several occasions in 1918, notably at the Battle of Hamel in July. Page was wounded in the abdomen at the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin in September 1918, and spent the remaining months of the war in England. He was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. New Guinea Page received his discharge in July 1919 and returned to university, graduating Bachelor of Arts the following year. He rejoined the public service and was posted to the Territory of New Guinea, recently acquired by Australia as a League of Nations mandate. Page briefly served as chief of police and director of schools, then in 1923 was appointed government secretary. He was an ex officio member of the territory's executive council and legislative council. According to his obituary in Pacific Islands Monthly, he was \\"practically a certainty for the Administratorship of the Territory, the next time it became vacant\\". As the most senior civil servant in the territory, Page was the deputy administrator and acted as territorial administrator on a number of occasions. In September 1941, he was made acting administrator at Rabaul when Administrator Walter McNicoll left for Lae. McNicoll subsequently fell ill with malaria, and Page became the main conduit to the federal government. He began evacuating women and children in December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, and in January 1942 sought permission from the Australian government to evacuate all white civilians from the territory. He was told that \\"unnecessary\\" civilians should be evacuated, but was refused permission for any administrative officers to leave. The Japanese invaded Rabaul on 23 January 1942, and Page was taken prisoner. According to Gordon Thomas, editor of the Rabaul Times, he was forced to perform manual labour and was \\"frequently kicked and beaten\\". Nelson Tokiel of the New Guinea Police Force recalled hearing that Page and 20 others had been imprisoned in a tunnel and \\"only occasionally, under heavy guard, allowed out to wash themselves\\". Page is listed among those who were aboard the unmarked prisoner of war ship Montevideo Maru when it was torpedoed and sunk by an American submarine on 1 July 1942. However, there were unconfirmed reports that senior officials had been executed prior to the ship leaving Rabaul. After his death, Page's widow donated a large decorative wooden cross to the Rabaul Methodist Church in his memory. Personal life Page married Anne Miller Brewster on 5 June 1919. The couple had two sons and three daughters together, including Robert Page who, as a member of Z Special Unit, was executed by the Japanese for espionage in 1945.

The spire is produced. Colour: On a buff ground the whole surface is irregularly clouded or mottled with burnt umber, the dark spaces often predominating. The shell contains six whorls, plus the protoconch, rounded, wound obliquely, excavated at the fasciole, and angled below it. Sculpture: The protoconch consists of 2¬Ω whorls and is microscopically obliquely reticulated. The body whorl has about forty spiral threads, the penultimate twelve, and so on till the topmost with three is reached. Between the larger threads smaller ones are intercalated, and gradually enlarge till of equal size. The small sharp radials, close set at the rate of about eighty to a whorl, override the spirals and produce beads at the points of intersection. These extend unbroken across the whole shell. The aperture is oblique elliptical, half the length of the shell. The outer lip is thin and arched forward. The notch is deep and broad. The inner lip excavates the sculpture of raised network in its path of advancement. The columella shows a thin callus deposit. Hedley, C. 1922. A revision of the Australian Turridae.

She was sometimes credited under her birth name. and she is often confused with fellow silent-era actress Peggy O'Dare.  Biography  O'Day was born in Ohio to Harry Berte and Maude Hopkins. Her father was a professional baseball player. She was raised in Kentucky and Missouri, and was the couple's only child. She said that she grew up poor, and she later gave donations to childrens' charities as an adult. O'Day moved to Los Angeles in her teens to begin her career as an actress and found work as a Christie bathing beauty. In 1921, she rejected an offer to join the Orpheum circuit as a vaudeville star. After appearing in comedies early in her career, she quickly developed a reputation as an accomplished horse rider and pioneering stuntwoman in Westerns. She even trained with boxer Kid McCoy to prepare for fight scenes. In 1923, she changed her name to Peggy O'Day, believing the name would be advantageous to her career. After an accident sustained on set caused her to retire from acting, she took on a new role: film editor. She was in charge of editing all of MGM's foreign releases during the early 1930s, and became an executive of the studio's international department.

Charpentier studies the environmental and biological stimulus of nuclear calcium signalling in plants. She obtained her PhD in Plant Molecular Biology from Ludwig Maximillians University of Munich. Following this, Charpentier joined the John Innes Centre in 2009, and became a David Philips fellow and group leader in 2017. Charpentier investigates what produces calcium oscillations and how calcium channels affect plant development and has published extensively on this topic. Nuclear calcium machinery is common to all land plants, her laboratory is exploring how this has evolved and functions across different species. Dr Charpentier has also published on topics including the dynamic organisation of the nucleus, and on legume symbiosis and nitrogen fixation. Charpentier's work with Giles Oldroyd led to the discovery of cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated ion channel 15s (CNGS15s). These proteins are key in the process to move calcium into the nucleus, an important part of the signal to the plant that nitrogen-fixing bacteria are in the soil nearby. More recently, in 2019, Charpentier's group discovered that nuclear calcium signalling plays another important role in plant roots, besides symbiosis. Her team showed that calcium can be released by the nucleus of root apical meristem ‚Äì the region of the growing root. Using genetic approaches, the team could modulate nuclear calcium signatures to obtain longer or shorter roots in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.

The molecule consists of four pyrrole rings connected by methylene bridges into a larger (non-aromatic) macrocycle ring, which makes it one of the simplest tetrapyrroles, and the simplest \\"true\\" one. As indicated by the name, it may be viewed as derived from porphine by the addition of six hydrogen atoms: four on the methine bridges, and two on the nitrogen atoms. Hexahydroporphine does not occur in nature, but is the core of porphyrinogens such as uroporphyrinogen III (UROGEN), which are precursors of many porphyrins ‚Äî derivatives of porphine of great biological importance. The six hydrogens of that core are removed at a later metabolic stage by the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Because of this connection, the compound is also called (unsubstituted) porphyrinogen. The compound is a colorless solid, soluble in dichloromethane, acetone, and diethyl ether. It decomposes at 185¬∞C.

Commercial career Francis Zachariae by Hansen, Schou & Weller Zachariae worked for Landmandsbanken in 1872-74. In 1874, he established a company making clothes for men in Copenhagen. He later also opened a retail store under the name Zachariaes Magasiner at Kultorvet 16. It was for many years one of the leading firms in the industry in Denmark. Zachariae headed the firm until 1931 and it was then passed to his long-time employee J. M. Rohwedder (1871-1950). In 1892, Zachariae founded the Association of Manufacturers of Gentlemen Clothing in Copenhagen (Foreningen af k√∏benhavnske fabrikanter af herrekl√¶der). He served as president of the association from 1911 to 1920. Publisher and local historian Zachariae used historical images in advertisements for his business. This inspired him to found a topographical-historical publication about the city. He published F√∏r og Nu I-IX, in 1915-23 followed by two Supplementary publications I‚ÄìII in 1924-27. He was personally deeply incolced in the work with compiling an extensive collections of often rare images from Copenhagen. The accompanying text by changing writers is of varying quality. Personal life and philanthropy Zachariae married twice. His first wife was Adriane (Addy) Louise Beckett (1851-1910), a daughter of merchant on Saint Croix Francis B. and Ann Eliza Lang (1822-89). They married on 22 February 1878 in St. Paul's Church in Copenhagen. His second wife was Nelly Mathilde Christophersen (1879-1931), a daughter of gardener Peter Julius C. (1845-1905) and Marie Kirstine Christoffersen (1853-1900). They married on 4 June 1915. He lived in Fredensborg from 1899. He was chairman of the parish council from 1905 to 1921. He purchased Skansebakken at Hiller√∏d in 1894 to protect the views from the hill. He later purchased the surrounding land and converted it into a public park in 1935. He purchased Asminder√∏d Church in 1919, restored it and gave it to the congregation with capital for future maintenance. In 1921, he founded the Nelly Zachariae Memorial Foundation, with circa DKK 1,300,000 in initial capital, supporting people who has experienced a deroute in life. In 1925, he was the principal founder of the institution Olaf Poulsens Minde (Slotsgade 4) in Fredensborg.

According to an article in iPolitics, he said, \\"Where measures are found to be in conflict with your rights, where they are inconsistent with the principles of good governance, or where they simply make no public policy sense, we will rescind them.\\" By June 2016, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) held about twenty \\"exploratory tables\\" with \\"indigenous leaders on potential self-government and land agreements.

The AFN held a Policy Forum entitled \\"Affirming First Nations Rights, Title and Jurisdiction\\" on September 11 and 12, 2018, to discuss the framework. The forum \\"turned disastrous\\" and faced a \\"nascent organized resistance that echoed the early days of the Idle No More movement.\\" AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde said in a September 11 speech during a forum to discuss the framework, that the Trudeau government, which wanted to introduce the framework by the fall, needed to slow down the process. By September 2018, according to Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, who is the \\"lead on the Indigenous framework file\\", Trudeau expressed concerns at the \\"slow pace of work\\" which he had hoped to introduce in the fall of 2018.

She went on to study experimental neurobiology and neuroethology at Adelphi university in New York with Carol Diakow. From 1984, she worked with Fernando Nottebohm at Rockefeller university where she earned her degree of Ph.D. Studying bird song, the researchers were involved in a series of studies that showed the generation of new neurons in the adult brain. These findings contradicted the then-established view that the brain was equipped with a fixed number of neurons at the time of birth. She moved to Paris in 1991, where she worked at the Institut d'Embryology Cellulaire et Mol√©culaire. She returned to New York as a Postdoctoral Associate to work with Nottebohm again in 1994.

Location  The temple is located on the banks of the River Sai in Lalupur village.Sri Astik Swami Mandir It is about 10 kilometers from Raebareli, an urban area in Uttar Pradesh, India. This temple is one of the most important places of worship to the Hindu deity 'Sri Aastik Swami', who is also known as the Lord of Snakes.  Mythology  According to the Mahabharata epic, Arjuna burnt the Khandav forest to expand the State of Hastinapur. During this expansion Sri Krishna helped by destroying the Naga dynasty through the destruction of the great Khandav forest. However the Pandavas did not want to kill the Nagas. To avenge the destruction of the Khandav forest, it is said that the Naga lineage led by Takshaka sought revenge against the Pandavas. The Nagas looked forward to the destruction of the Pandava kingdom in Hastinapur. During this time, the son of Arjuna, Parikshit was killed by a Nagvanshi warrior named Takshaka. The weapon used to kill him was called the Nagpash. Angered by this act, Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit burned a large number of snakes alive in an act called the Sarp Yagya. However, Sri Aastik Swami saved some of the important snakes. The day when these snakes were saved came to be known as Shravan Shukla Panchami and later Nagapanchami. Overjoyed by Sri Swami Sri Astik's actions, the snakes blessed him with supreme power and also a blessing that his worshippers would never need to fear snakes or any venomous creatures. In fact, no one would fear snakes wherever his name was spoken.  Culture  Sri Swami is worshipped across India and the Aastik Swami Mandir in Raebareli is one of the major places for worshipping him. The festival of Nagpanchami (also known as Gudiya) is celebrated with a lot of zeal and enthusiasm. It is believed that if you take a dip in the holy Sai River beside the temple and go to see the Lord in wet clothes, all your wishes will be fulfilled. Instead of offering flowers, the tradition is to offer him wooden gifts.

Lowrey Surrey N.W. 5g 755 They have been working together since 1983. She graduated in 1984 from City and Guilds of London Art School. Career As of 2019, Fiona Peever was based with her husband at their Lettering & Sculpture Limited studio at Ducklington, Oxfordshire. The company was incorporated in 2008. She was initially the company secretary, and she additionally became a director in 2015. She creates art in partnership with her husband Alec Peever, and in cooperation with other artists. She specialises in public art, including large sculptures, stone carving and lettering, and combines traditional with experimental techniques. She uses various materials for her sculptures, including wood, steel and bronze, besides slate, marble and other types of stone. Architectural carving is one of her specialities, and she has made church and graveyard memorials. She creates poetry trails and installations, besides garden and water features, and many of these are public works. Together with Alec she has shown her work at many exhibitions, and has achieved a number of awards. Works The following is a small sample of many commissions which were executed by Fiona in collaboration with Alec and other artists. Thomas Attwood, Chamberlain Square, Birmingham, 1993 The full title of this sculpture in Chamberlain Square, Birmingham, is Thomas Attwood 1783‚Äì1856, Birmingham's first Member of Parliament. It was a collaboration between Sioban Coppinger and Fiona Peever. In this sculpture, the bronze Thomas Attwood, the economist who helped bring about the Reform Act of 1832, has apparently climbed down from his pedestal ‚Äì or soapbox ‚Äì and is sitting on the steps of the amphitheatre, continuing his work. Inscribed on the steps where he has walked are the words, \\"prosperity,\\" \\"the vote,\\" and \\"reform.\\" His scattered notes are titled: Votes for All, Full Employment, and Free Trade. The sculpture has been \\"said to reflect the values Mr Attwood promoted ‚Äì reform, vote and prosperity.\\" The sculpture was removed for safekeeping in 2015, before Birmingham Central Library was demolished in the following year. The statue may be gone until building work is completed, but the brown plaque that commemorates it remains.

Fiona and Alec Peever developed stone carvings from the children's designs, and they were placed high on the cornice of the library. The nine winning designs are: Wild boar, Dodo, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, J. R. R. Tolkien characters, General Pitt Rivers, Aslan the Lion, Green Man, Sir Thomas Bodley, and Three Men in a Boat. Isobel Hughes, the University of Oxford's head of building conservation, commented: \\"The grotesques will stare out over Oxford for hundreds of years. I hope the winners will be able to revisit their stone carvings many times, bringing their children and their grandchildren to see them too.\\" Regarding the view of the carvings from below, Alec Peever said: \\"It's to do with the foreshortening and the perspective of the figures, and also the way the shadows work in order to create the strength of design that can be understood by the passerby.\\" Dr Sarah Thomas, librarian, said: \\"They have been beautifully interpreted by the stone carvers who have managed to create grotesques that work as sculptures and yet still capture the original charm of the children's drawings.\\" In 2010 Fiona and Alec received a Grotesques Award from the University of Oxford Estate Services. Architectural sculpture, Highgate Junior School, 2016 This Junior department of Highgate School in London was designed by Architype in Portland stone to replace the Cholmeley House library, and completed in 2016. Fiona and Alec executed sculptures here, including a chameleon, a centipede, and gargoyles on themes appropriate for children, as well as a painted glass window screen.

Failing eye-sight caused by cataracts was only partially restored after surgery, and affected her efforts in the temperance cause. Early years Lavantia Densmore was born in Rochester, New York, March 1, 1827. She was one of seven children. Her parents, Joel and Sophia Densmore, were poor. When Douglass was about nine years old, her parents removed to a farm at Crawford County, Pennsylvania. Appreciating their own lack of education, both parents strove to give their children the best educational opportunities possible, The sole luxury of their home was literature. They took the Democratic Review, almost the only magazine then published in the United States, and such papers as the National Era and the Boston Investigator. Her siblings included brothers, Emmet and William, and a sister, Elizabeth. Career On October 4, 1853, she married Joshua Douglass (or Douglas), a young lawyer of Meadville, Pennsylvania, where she lived for the rest of her life until near the time of her death. Their children were: Marion, born February 7, 1855; Ellen, born 1858; Robert, born 1861, died 1862; Mabel, born 1864; and Gertrude, born 1866. In Meadville, her life was devoted to caring for her household and rearing her children, as well as participating in the literary and charitable societies. In 1872, she made a visit to Europe. She arrived home from Europe on December 23, 1873, the day of the great Woman's Temperance Crusade, launched in Hillsboro, Ohio. Meadville was aroused by the great outpouring, and the following March, a mass meeting was called and a temperance organization effected. Very early on, Douglass not only identified herself with the movement, and was an active worker in the cause, but also became a member of the WCTU. For many years, she served as president of the Meadville Union. Her enthusiasm and labors made her name in her own community a synonym for temperance. Personal life In religion, Douglass and her husband were members of the Unitarian Congregation of Meadville. For a few years, Douglass retired from active efforts in the temperance cause, owing to failing eye- sight. Cataracts formed on both of her eyes, and though they were removed, she only regained partial vision. In the winter of 1898‚Äì99, she had had a surgical operation for a malignant growth and had recovered almost completely from its effects, when a little more than a week before her death, she broke one of her legs. She died in Manhattan, on Saturday, May 27, 1899 at the residence of her daughter, Mrs. John Crawford Burns, Manhattan, as a result of shock after the fracture. She was buried in the family lot at Greendale Cemetery in Meadville.

Here she created her first two documentary films, Hosi Katekisa Mo√ßambique and Manjacaze. The mid-1980s are considered a seminal time in the Mozambique film industry, and one of the flourishing periods of cinema in southern Africa. Around this time, she was part of a group of budding filmmakers who made O Tempo dos Leopardos (Time of the Leopards), which is considered to be the first feature film made in Mozambique. In 1986, the government stopped funding the National Cinema Institute, and many filmmakers found themselves unemployed. Noronha started working as an independent filmmaker, and was one of the founders of the first video cooperative of the Mozambique directors guild, Coopimagem. In 1991, she created As√≠ na Cidade (Once upon a time in the city), a documentary film about child-soldier war refugees who sell newspapers in Maputo. This same year she gave birth to her daughter, and decided to realize her dream of studying psychology at the Polytechnic University in Maputo. She finished her Bachelor's degree in clinical psychology in 2002, and then went on to study psychoanalysis, social psychology and communications. In 2007 she completed her Master's degree in mental health and social work at Leon University in Spain. In 2003, Noronha began combining her work as a psychotherapist with her film work. With the help of a grant from the Amocine movie fund, she shot the documentary film Sonhos Guardados (Guarded Dreams). In 2007 she made her first full-length film, Ngwenya, o crocodilo (Ngwenya the Crocodile), about the Mozambican artist, Malangatana Valente Ngwenya. One of her most noted works is the New Family Trilogy, Trilogia das Novas Fam√≠lias, a trilogy of documentary films about a new family model that arose in Mozambique, made up of children orphaned as a result of the AIDS epidemic.  Awards  In 2009, Noronha won the Cineposible Film Festival Creative Woman award for her film M√£e dos Netos (Mother of the Grandchildren). That same year, she won the Janela para o Mundo (window to the world) award for the best documentary film for Ngwenya, o crocodilo, at the Africa, Asia and Latin American Film Festival in Milan.

It was Harrison's thirteenth and penultimate collection. Sixty-seven poems make up the collection, including \\"Suite of Unreason\\", a poem of over 350 lines, and a sequence of seven poems relating to rivers (River I - VII). Many of the poems are concerned with the transcendent natural world. The collection won the High Plains Book Award for Poetry in 2012.  Themes   Dogs and Birds  Non-human creatures, especially dogs and birds, figure prominently in the poems. For example, in Mary the Drug Addict (a poem about a dog named Mary), the poet speaks of the ability to communicate with his dog. In the poem \\"Prado,\\" which references dogs, birds and fish, the poet talks about the healing power of a relationship with animals: In \\"Chatter,\\" the poet discusses his non-human nature:  Death  A number of poems evaluate death: how we think about it, how we remember it, how it affects us.

(the G.F. & A.), known as the Sumatra Leaf Route, and colloquially as the Gopher, Frog & Alligator was a -long railroad from Richland, Georgia to Carrabelle, Florida. It was founded in 1895 as a logging railroad, the Georgia Pine Railway. The northern and southern ends of the railroad have been abandoned, but the section from Cuthbert, Georgia, to Tallahassee, Florida, remains in use by various railroads.  History  Georgia Pine Railway locomotive #3 at Coquitt, Georgia before 1898 Hannibal Kimball promoted the Bainbridge, Cuthbert and Columbus Railroad to run north-to-south through southwest Georgia in 1869. Although work began on construction in 1870, it was never completed, and in 1872 the project was abandoned amidst financial problems and bond endorsement issues that stirred allegations of impropriety against Kimball. During the 1880s, attempts were made to revive the railroad, with some activity taking place in the middle of that decade, but this too came to nothing. Finally, in 1895 local entrepreneur J. D. Williams laid rails on part of the route creating the Georgia Pine Railroad connecting Bainbridge to Arlington. By 1898, the railroad was renamed the Georgia Florida and Alabama Railroad and by 1901, it had been extended north to Richland. In 1902, the G.F. & A. completed the section from Tallahassee to Bainbridge. The G.F.& A. was leased to the Seaboard Air Line Railway in 1927. The Seaboard went into receivership at the end of 1930, and the lease was revoked in 1931. The Seaboard was reformed after receiving government loans, and it agreed to operate, but not lease the G.F. & A. In 1944, the court that was overseeing the Seaboard's receivership authorized the company to purchase 90% of the G.F. & A.'s bonds. Seaboard became part of CSX Transportation in 1980. In 1983, the former G.F. & A. line was sold off to the South Carolina Central Railroad, and in 1989 it became part of the Georgia Southwestern Railroad. In 1997, the portion of the G.F. & A. route from Richland south to Cuthbert was abandoned, and in 2002 the Georgia Department of Transportation acquired the remaining Cuthbert to Bainbridge section. The Georgia Southwestern remains the operator of the line.  Route  The northern terminus of the line was at Richland, where it met the Savannah, Americus and Montgomery Railway and the Columbus Southern Railway. It ran almost due south through Cuthbert and Edison to reach Arlington, where it crossed the Central of Georgia Railway. It continued through Colquitt and Bainbridge before crossing the Flint river and entering Florida. It continued through Sopchoppy and Tallahassee and on to its southern terminus in Carrabelle on the Florida Gulf Coast.  Today  The Cuthbert- Bainbridge segment is now owned by the Georgia Department of Transportation and operated by the Georgia Southwestern Railroad. The segment from Bainbridge to Attapulgus, Georgia, is owned by CSX. The Attapulgus-Tallahassee segment is owned by the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad. A 2.4-mile part of the abandoned Tallahassee-Carrabelle segment of the GF&A; is now the Tallahassee- Georgia Florida and Alabama (GF&A;) Trail in the Apalachicola National Forest. Research work on the rail-to-trail project was done by Genesis Group.

V. Wills. Its purpose was to prepare students for examinations set by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, founded in 1841. Westminster College flourished in the late Nineteenth Century but faced growing competition from public institutions in the 1920s and 1930s, and it closed its doors in around 1942. History Victorian Origins Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Trinity Street, Southwark. From the Prospectus and syllabus of the Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy, London, 1901. The Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy was a private college founded in October 1874 by the chemist and pharmacist George S. V. Wills. Its purpose was to prepare students for examinations set by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, founded in 1841. By 1877, three years after its foundation, Westminster College was able to make the claim that it was the largest school of its kind in London. In addition, its students had achieved almost as many examination passes as all the other schools in England combined. Expansion and growth In 1882, as his student body expanded, Wills moved Westminster College into new premises, a defunct Baptist chapel in Trinity Street, Southwark. In 1908, Wills suffered a financial setback following the failure of his pharmacy business, resulting in the loss of Wills's house and his personal assets. This financial failure caused the voluntary liquidation of Westminster College, despite it being registered as a limited company in 1901. However, the College was moved to a new location in Clapham, where it resumed its activities In 1899 Wills self-published a memoir titled The Works of George S. V. Wills and The Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy. In December 1916 Westminster College moved again, from 402 to 190 Clapham Road. Decline and closure During the 1920s and 1930s growing competition from public institutions began to put pressure on private schools such as Westminster College, and their number began to decline. Westminster College was one of the last survivors, and it continued to advertise its courses into the 1930s. Its founder, George S V Wills, died on 28 April 1932, aged 84. In 1939, at the outbreak of war, the threat of air attacks led the College to discontinue day classes in favour of correspondence courses. The College address at 190 Clapham Road ceased to exist in 1942, most likely the year of its closure. References External links *George S. V.

In some jurisdictions the crime is called \\"larceny by finding\\" or \\"stealing by finding\\".  By nation   United States  In the United States, if the owner of a property has renounced all property rights in the object, then the property is abandoned. Since theft is the unlawful taking of another person's property, an essential element of the actus reus of theft is absent. The finder of lost property acquires a possessory right by taking physical control of the property, but does not necessarily have ownership of the property. The finder must take reasonable steps to locate the owner. If the finder shows that reasonable steps to find the owner have been taken then the finder may establish that the required mens rea for theft, the intention to deprive the owner permanently, is absent. An issue may arise when a person takes possession of lost property with the intention of returning it to the owner after inquiry but later converts the property to the finder's use. This is illustrated by Thompson v. Nixon [1965] 3 W.L.R. 501: an off duty police constable found a bag of rabbit food lying by the roadside, took it home intending to hand it in as lost property but some time after decided to keep it for his own use. He was found guilty at first instance but his ultimate appeal to the Divisional Court was upheld. The appellate court held that, at the time of finding, there was no mens rea to support a conviction of larceny. In some jurisdictions this has been addressed by statute; see, for example, s. 124, Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) allowing a jury to reach an alternative verdict of \\"fraudulent appropriation\\".  Australia  In Victoria, the Victorian Crimes Act defines this crime by exception \\"72.3(c) A person's appropriation of property belonging to another is not to be regarded as dishonest if he appropriates the property in the belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps. In Queensland, there is a similar warning.

He is remembered as the owner and developer of the York Hotel, at the time regarded as Adelaide's finest. Background The widower John Mitcham Hornabrook of Egloskerry, Cornwall, with his children Ann Greenfield Hornabrook and Charles Atkins Hornabrook arrived in South Australia in December 1838 aboard Glenalvon. In December 1849 John Hornabrook applied for the publican's licence for the York Hotel, a modest family hotel at the south- east corner of Rundle and Pulteney streets, previously held by its founder Jane Bathgate (died June 1869). He was successful, but only on the casting vote of the chairman. In 1854 the licence was transferred to John Bray, previously landlord of the \\"Grace Darling\\" and \\"Glenelg Hotel\\", and most likely John Hornabrook's brother-in-law. John Hornabrook married Sarah n√©e Shephard, whose sister Anna Shephard (died 18 July 1876) married one John Bray, date and location as yet unknown and died before her. There are three John Brays known in South Australia at the time, one being John Cox Bray, another a miner in Moonta. The third John Bray (c. 1812 ‚Äì 1 March 1868), who arrived aboard Hartley in October 1837 and died at residence, Pulteney Street is a likely candidate. The fact of his daughter Alice marrying someone of a similar name may be entirely coincidental. Bray was not an uncommon surname in 1850s South Australia. History C. A. Hornabrook, hotelier and businessman, c. 1885 York Hotel, Adelaide in 1866, Rundle Street east York Hotel, corner Rundle and Pulteney streets, Adelaide c. 1880 \\"Kalymna\\", Dequetteville Tce, Kent Town in 1875 \\"Eothen\\", East Terrace, Adelaide in 1900 C. A. Hornabrook first became interested in Rundle Street in 1851, when he leased Town acre 39 from Samuel George Smith, of the London banking firm of Smith, Payne & Smiths, then sublet it for building. Town acre 39 was owned by Samuel George Smith, not John Abel Smith (1802‚Äì1871), who may have been related. Smith, Payne & Smiths of Lombard Street invested heavily in Adelaide properties. In 1857 he applied, successfully, for the licence for the York Hotel previously held by his father then by John Bray. That same year he married Eliza Maria Soward, sister of architect George Klewitz Soward. In 1863 the first major improvement was commissioned: a separate building adjacent on Rundle Street with seven bedrooms with balconies projecting over the footpath, and a bathroom. Soward was the architect and Charles Farr the builder. In 1867 he purchased a property between Third and Fourth creeks near Magill, previously owned by Dr David Wark, but apparently not Wark's residence \\"Alton\\", which was owned by Daniel Chappell between 1862 and 1876. In 1868 he had Charles Farr pull down the old portion of the York Hotel, and in its place build a new \\"pile\\" designed by Daniel Garlick. George Scarfe, the (unmarried) man largely responsible for the preeminence of Harris, Scarfe & Co., was a longtime resident. In 1878 substantial additions were made by Woods & McMinn, notably the addition of two billiard rooms and a row of shops. W. E. Ford was the new licensee, but Hornabrook retained ownership until 1900, when he sold it for ¬£28,000 by the Melbourne firm of Foy & Gibson. :It was demolished by Foy and Gibson in 1909 to make way for the Grand Central Hotel, of six storeys in the style of their emporium next door. but despite some high-profile guests (the Prince of Wales in 1920, Arthur Conan Doyle in 1922), it never prospered, and around 1925 was incorporated into the emporium. It later became showrooms and offices for the Electricity Trust, then in 1975‚Äì1976 was demolished to make way for a multi-level car park, which was later hidden by the \\"Rundle Lantern\\" a hoarding of aluminium panels, individually illuminated. In 1874 he commissioned Farr to build the imposing residence \\"Dunheved House\\" later \\"Kalymna\\" (architect Thomas English), which still stands at 28 Dequetteville Terrace, Kent Town. A large collection of their furnishings and household goods was sold by auction in 1879 prior to leaving, with their six youngest children, on a trip to England by the clipper Hesperus, sharing the saloon with the Rischbieth family. Hornabrook returned alone in April 1882 on the steamer Cuzco, staying at \\"Landrowna Terrace\\", Victoria Square, resigned his directorship of several companies including Grove Hill Gold Mining Company. In 1887 he offered some ¬£30,000 worth of shares at auction in a slow market. He then became, with J. M. Wendt and a few others, a major shareholder in the Baker's Creek gold mine at Hillgrove, New South Wales. In 1891 he had a new residence built at the south corner of East Terrace and Gilles Street, designed by George Klewitz Soward, naming it \\"E√∂then\\". In 1928 it became the home of Sir Lavington Bonython and his family, renamed \\"St Corantyn\\". Recognition *It has been asserted that Charles Street (a private thoroughfare between Rundle Street and North Terrace, east of Gawler Place) was named for him. *He was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1887. and served as magistrate on many prominent prosecutions. *He was in 1890 elected a Fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute. *He was in 1891 elected a patron of the Medindie Football Club.

He is the UK's LGBT History Month Poet Laureate and was Yorkshire's Poet for 2012 (the county's selected poet for the 2012 Olympics). He writes poetry, plays and fiction, and he occasionally performs as Beyonce Holes. Biography Adam Lowe is of Caribbean (St. Kitts), British and Irish descent. He is the son of Councillor Alison Lowe, and like her graduated with both a BA and MA from the University of Leeds. His family was the subject of the 1999 ITV docu-soap Family Life (Lion TV). Writing, publishing and performance Adam Lowe writes about disability, LGBT experiences and the lives of mixed race/Black British communities. Carol Rumens of The Guardian describes him as a 'versatile and widely published young writer'. Lowe is LGBT History Month Poet Laureate; founded and runs Young Enigma, a writer development project for young writers; is Editor-in-Chief of Vada Magazine and Dog Horn Publishing; and is Publicity Officer for Peepal Tree Press. He has performed around the world, at festivals and conferences, including the Black and Asian Writers Conference. He is an advocate for LGBT rights and sits on the management committee for Schools OUT UK, the charity that founded LGBT History Month in the UK. He was formerly Features Editor for Bent Magazine and Editor of a speculative fiction magazine called Polluto. In 2010, he was writer-in-residence at I Love West Leeds Arts Festival in Armley, where he lived. He studied under Madani Younis at Freedom Studios in Leeds' sister city, Bradford. He was also announced as a finalist for the 22nd Annual Lambda Literary Awards with his novella Troglodyte Rose (later, a selection from the book would be a Wattpad featured story getting over 190,000 reads). In 2011, Lowe was writer on attachment at West Yorkshire Playhouse, and partnered with composer Nikki Franklin for Leeds Lieder+ at Leeds College of Music, before the two collaborated on a new work, 'Mary', for the BBC Singers. In 2012, his pamphlet Precocious (Fruit Bruise Press) was a reader nomination for the Guardian First Book Prize, which the publication described as, 'A vivid picture of emotions, deeply felt, but with a clear-eyed view of the ways we humans live, love and sometimes betray'. He had a residency at Zion Arts Centre. That year he was Yorkshire's poet for the 12 Poets of 2012 scheme, celebrating the 2012 Olympics and the 2012 Cultural Olympiad, where he visited boxer Anthony Ogogo on a training session to inspire the writing of an Olympic-themed poem for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The final poem was performed by the National Lottery Draw Show's Voice of the Balls Alan Dedicoat at the National Lottery Plot in the Olympic Park on 3 September 2012. He rounded the year off with inclusion in MTV Books' Chorus: A Literary Mixtape, edited by Saul Williams and Dufflyn Lammers. In 2013, he was announced as one of 10 Black and Asian 'advanced poets' for The Complete Works II (founded by Bernardine Evaristo) with Mona Arshi, Jay Bernard, Kayo Chingonyi, Rishi Dastidar, Edward Doegar, Inua Ellams, Sarah Howe, Eileen Pun and Warsan Shire, which resulted in the anthology Ten: The New Wave, edited by Karen McCarthy-Woolf. He was mentored on the programme by Patience Agbabi. He also made the list of '20 under 40' writers in Leeds for the LS13 Awards, where Lowe was given as an example of 'the non-conformist and boundary- breaking approach to writing in Leeds'. In 2014, he toured his solo show, Ecstasies, which began at Contact Theatre's Queer Contact. He performed a poem about cruising for 4thought.tv on Channel 4. In 2015, his Polari poem Vada That was selected as The Guardian Poem of the Week. His play Friend Roulette ran for a week at the Amersham Arms in London. A four-star review in Theatre Bubble said: 'Friend Roulette by LGBT writer Adam Lowe, directed by Rachel Owens, sheds light on a gay friendship that is pushed by.. society? inhibitions? fear? into the confines of a chat room (Friend Roulette). But it could also be a comment on the real life app, Grindr, where users meet for sex and chance encounters. The intensity of the meetings that can only be virtual and therefore 'not real' for one of the friends, played by Robert Wallis, causes him to break free for the real world, leaving his internet friend Jonathan Woodhouse, stuck in the hell of a darkened room.' The Guardian referred to the short play, in published form, as 'a fine playlet that I was very impressed by'. In 2017, he performed with composer Nikki Franklin in the Speaker's Chambers at the House of Commons for LGBT History Month. In 2018-9, he featured in the British Library's Windrush Stories exhibition, performing a poem based on the Lord's Prayer. In 2019, his poem 'Bone Railroad', about slavery and the Middle Passage was selected as Poem of the Week by The Yorkshire Times. Songwriting In 2006, Lowe wrote the lyrics and performed the vocals for a hard house/trance single called 'Some Justice' with DJ GRH & Paul Maddox. Teaching and mentoring Lowe tutors for The Poetry School, he is a facilitator with English PEN and he teaches at the University of Leeds on the MA Writing for Performance & Publication.Adam Lowe, 'Alumni Profile: Alison Lowe', Leeds: The Magazine for Alumni of the University of Leeds, 19 (2018), 35.

Ancient age  Palazzo Gonzaga-Acerbi The territory of Castel GoffredoMantua and its province. has been inhabited since the Bronze Age. The area was therefore affected by both Etruscan civilization, as evidenced by the discovery of some everyday utensils such as cups and jugs for water, which from Roman civilization starting from 1st century, with the discovery of some votive altar and of a sepulchral tombstone. This area was affected by the centuriation of Mantua and on the romanization of the historical center some scholars suppose that this was divided into twelve blocks and characterized by cardo and Decumanus Maximus and that at the intersection of \\"cardo maximum\\" and \\"decumanus maximus\\" were placed the forum, today represented by Mazzini Square.  Medieval age  The first mention of Castellum Vifredi as an urban agglomeration is from 8 July 1107. Between 800 and 1115 Castel Goffredo belonged to county of Brescia up to 1190. Later the city gave the status of free commune and when Brescia was not able to offer its defense, in 1337 preferred to place itself under the protection of Mantua and Gonzaga. After alternate dominations of the Visconti (1337), of the Gonzagas (from 1337 to 1348), again of the Visconti (from 1348 to 1404), of Malatesta (from 1404 to 1426), of the Republic of Venice (from 1426 to 1431 and again from 1439 to 1441) and finally of the Gonzagas (from 1441), in 1466 with Alessandro Gonzaga the village became an imperial fief autonomous and he saw the birth of Marquess of Castel Goffredo. During his term the village was enlarged, the second city walls was erected and the \\"Alessandrini Statutes\\" were issued, which bears his name and remained in force until 1796.  Modern age  The marquis Aloisio Gonzaga With the marquis Aloisio Gonzaga in 1511 began the cadet branch of \\"Gonzaga of Castel Goffredo\\" and Castel Goffredo became capital of the small state. In his palace of residence (Gonzaga-Acerbi Palace) he created a magnificent court, frequented by poets (Matteo Bandello, Lucrezia Gonzaga and Pietro Aretino), artists, diplomats (Cesare Fregoso) and ambassadors (Antonio Rincon). In 1516 passed through Castel Goffredo the emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg while he pursued the French troops, and another emperor, Charles V, he was a guest of Aloisio Gonzaga on June 28, 1543 and obtained the keys to the citadel. The marquis perhaps commissioned the school of Giulio Romano to fresco his domus: remain in the loggia of the palace important pictorial evidence of that period. Aloisio Gonzaga died on July 19, 1549 and his was a troubled succession. He was first succeeded by the eldest son Alfonso Gonzaga, who ruled the city from 1549 to 1592, when he died assassinated, for hereditary reasons, to Corte Gambaredolo by the hand of the nephew's assassins Rodolfo Gonzaga, brother of Aloysius Gonzaga. Rodolfo took possession of the fortress and ruled Castel Goffredo in terror. The castellan people did not accept the abuses and organized a conspiracy that led to the assassination of the marquis on January 3, 1593, while going to the religious services in the St. Erasmus church . With his death, without male sons, the history of the locality as an autonomous Gonzaga fief and the short lordship of the \\"Gonzaga di Castel Goffredo\\" also ended. After a long dispute at the imperial court of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor between the third marquis of Castiglione Francesco Gonzaga (1577-1616) and the duke of Mantua Vincenzo I Gonzaga, in which he intervened in 1602 as ambassador, without result, Lorenzo da Brindisi, the city was definitively aggregated by imperial decree in 1603 to Duchy of Mantua and it followed its destiny until 1707 when the last of the Gonzagas, the duke Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, was deposed by the emperor Joseph I of Habsburg and forced into exile. The Austrian domination determined the occupation of the city and the requisition of the warehouses of supplies and between the 1705 and 1706 Austrian soldiers sacked Castel Goffredo, taking hostage also some inhabitants. In 1796 Napoleon Bonaparte pushed the Austrians beyond Mincio and in 1797 Austria ceded Lombardy to the French. On May 13 of that year, Castel Goffredo was occupied by French troops.  Contemporary age  Castel Goffredo Town Hall The Austrian governments followed in 1799, French from 1801 to 1814 and again Austrians until 1866. In the years of 1848 Castel Goffredo was the anti-Austrian conspiratorial center of the Upper Mantovano and counted the presence of numerous patriots, led by the Castellano Giovanni Acerbi, who later became the intendant of Expedition of the Thousand of Garibaldi. The conspiracy was discovered and resulted in the tragic page of Belfiore martyrs. In 1859, after the Battle of Solferino and San Martino which also involved the territory of Castel Goffredo being here deployed the 3rd corps of the general Fran√ßois Certain de Canrobert, the city was aggregated to Kingdom of Sardinia and in 1861 became part of Kingdom of Italy. In 1871 was founded \\"Societ√† di Mutuo Soccorso\\" which in 1900 counted three hundred members. 1925 marked the economic and industrial turnaround of Castel Goffredo: in fact, he opened the first sock factory, the NO.E.MI., destined to write the history of the industrialization of the area. On 19 September 1926 Castel Goffredo was devastated by the assassination by the fascists of the catholic master Anselmo Cessi. After the second world war Castel Goffredo had a great economic development, becoming an industrial center of primary importance for the textile industry, thanks to the consistent production of socks for women, pantyhose and yarns. He acquired the title of city in 2002.

At that time, the police arrived at the place and ask Mirchi Maya to surrender but she reveals that she is Shanmugavel's daughter and shoots herself in front of her father. The abducted women including Vandana are saved.

Kamaraj, who directed the gangster film Perusu (2005), directed Vilai who was inspired by a real-life story and told the story of a prostitution racket that kidnapped and sold women against their will. Bharani was selected to play the lead role alongside veteran actors Saravanan and Bhanu Chander while Udhayathara, Ritu Soni, Shathiga and Fathima played the female lead. The film was primarily shot in Chennai and Madurai. Soundtrack The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer D. Imman. The soundtrack features 4 tracks. The audio was released on 23 May 2010 in Chennai. Directors Samuthirakani, Vetrimaaran, V. C. Guhanathan, K. Bhagyaraj and A. L. Vijay attended the audio launch. Release The film was released on 27 August 2010 alongside five other films. Critical reception The New Indian Express said, \\"it misses the emotional punch, the script never really allows us to get involved or empathise with the plight of the girls. On the flip side, it is appreciable that the director has chosen a socially relevant theme, and that he has resisted slipping in sleaze, or any overt skin show\\". S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu praised the cast and wrote, \\"director G. Kamaraj handles the scenes deftly and with sensitivity. However, he could have looked into the slow pace of the first half\\". Sify stated, \\"the film is too long winded and moves at a snail pace. There is also too much mush and melodrama, towards the climax \\". Box office The film took a below average opening at the Chennai box office.

He was known as ‚ÄòBumper John‚Äô from his enduring belief that ‚Äòanother bumper‚Äô (of drink) would cure all ills Forbes was the eldest son of Duncan Forbes, Shire Commissioner, of Culloden and his wife Mary Innes, daughter of Sir Robert Innes, 2nd Baronet, of Innes, Elgin. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and privately in Edinburgh in 1692 although he shirked his studies. In 1692 he was sent to the Low Countries though without a settled objective and spent about a year there. He spent money but read little, and disappointed his parents by failing improve himself in useful skills, preferring the bottle instead. He eventually married Jean Gordon, daughter of Sir Robert Gordon, 2nd Baronet, of Gordonstoun, Elgin, in June 1699 and was Commissioner justiciary for the Highlands in 1701 and1702. Old Culloden House Forbes succeeded his father to the Culloden estate in 1704 and became Shire Commissioner for Nairnshire in the Scottish parliament He immediately associated himself with the opposition and appears to have stayed with the Country party, at least with regard the Union, which he denounced as a road to ‚Äòinevitable ruin, with regard to Church and state‚Äô. In the Scottish parliament he registered a large number of anti-Court votes. Some of these may have been the result of Presbyterian scruples; but he had a material concern that the Union might end a lucrative excise exemption which he had and he became involved in a lengthy legal dispute. Forbes did not stand at the 1708 British general election, but his subsequent manoeuvring shows that he wanted to increase his political influence by gaining a seat in the House of Commons. However he did not stand at the 1710 British general election. At the 1713 British general election he was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Nairnshire, which he had represented in the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland. He established a connection with the Duke of Argyll but made little impression in Parliament. He was in Edinburgh for the proclamation of King George, which he duly subscribed. Forbes worked hard in the Whig interest at the 1715 British general election when he was returned as MP for Inverness-shire. He took part in the defence of the northern counties during the 1715 Jacobite rebellion but deprecated the harsh treatment of the rebels, especially with regard to forfeitures. He spent about ¬£3,000 in the service of the crown, which was only partly recompensed by a post as Commissioner of the Equivalent at ¬£500 a year from 1716. He was also in 1716 a Commissioner to oversee elections of council at Elgin, a Councillor of Inverness and provost of Inverness until 1717. He was also a visitor at Aberdeen University from 1716 to 1717. With his brother, Duncan, he became attached to the Duke of Argyll, and voted against the Government on the motion of 4 June 1717 against Argyll‚Äôs military rival, Lord Cadogan. Four days later, he attended the dinner given by Argyll for his followers. Although he lost his place as Commissioner of the Equivalent, he voted with the Government in 1719, when Argyll returned to office. He was provost of Inverness again in 1721. Drink took a firmer hold over him, and when in 1721 he was elected as an elder of his local synod, there was a protest on the grounds that he was ‚Äòa habitual neglecter of family worship‚Äô and ‚Äòa known drunkard‚Äô At the 1722 British general election he was defeated at Inverness-shire, but was once more returned for Nairnshire. At the 1727 British general election there was no representation at Nairnshire and he was defeated at Inverness-shire. He stood for Inverness-shire unsuccessfully in 1734, when he was a dying man. Forbes was ‚Äòa friend to a cheerful glass‚Äô to the end, and died at Edinburgh on 18 December 1734 of ‚Äòa complaint in his bowels‚Äô. He left one son, but his other children predeceased him. His brother Duncan inherited the estate.

Canright joined the team in 1939 as a human computer, which required \\"Teams of people who were frequently used to undertake long and often tedious calculations; the work was divided so that this could be done in parallel.\\" During her time at the JPL program she was instrumental in calculating both the thrust-to-weight ratio for performance of engines under various conditions, and the potential of rocket propellant (which would be used by the U.S. Navy). Canright was critical in the development of the JPL program and laid the foundations for other women to work in a field which was previously closed off to them.  Pre-JPL Program  Canright was born on November 12, 1919 in Iowa during the midst of the American Roaring 20's. Canright was an exceptionally smart student during high-school and took upper level classes, most notably in math and Chemistry. She met her future husband, Richard Canright, when they were both undergrads at Miami University of Ohio, where her father was a Professor and Dean of Students. After eloping when she was 19 and he was 21, they moved to Pasadena for Richard to attend graduate school at Caltech. Before joining JPL, Canright worked as a typist while attending college at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Canright graduated from Occidental College in 1940.  Career  Human computers - Jet Propulsion Laboratory employees In 1939 the National Academy of Sciences approached Caltech's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (who were known around Caltech's campus as the \\"Suicide Squad\\" because of numerous experiments gone wrong) with a grant for Rocket Research of $1,000. The next year, the U.S. government invested $10,000 into the program, which prompted the group to hire outside help. One of the men who started JPL, Frank Malina, approached Barbara and Richard Canright for positions as mathematicians. Both Barbara and Richard accepted the positions which made Barbara the only female employee at JPL at the time. During her time at JPL, Canright calculated thrust from rocket engines and analyzed the data to increase performance. One of JPL's, and Canright's, crowning achievements was the successful use of rockets for bomber aircraft. After the successful development of jet propulsion bombers, JPL shifted its focus to designing a rocket which would reach a higher altitude than a helium-filled balloon. Canright, along with Melba Nead, Virginia Prettyman, and Macie Roberts, were responsible for calculating the potential of rocket propellants. In 1943, after the success of designing and testing of a rocket propellant, Canright became pregnant with her first child. Due to the unavailability of maternity leave in 1943, Canright had to resign.  Later life  Just like her early life, Canright's life after the JPL program has largely been forgotten. Some information has been uncovered through Barbara's daughter, Patricia Canright Smith. Throughout Barbara and Richard's marriage they had four children: Bruce Canright, Patricia Canright Smith, Geoff Canright, and David Canright. Bruce was a scientist at NASA, Geoff, a physics professor, David, a math professor, and Patricia, a private-practice psychotherapist. In 1964 Barbara and Richard Canright divorced after 26 years of marriage. Barbara Canright passed away in Seattle Washington at age 78 on September 17, 1997.  Recognition  Barbara Canright's crucial role in the development of the JPL program has been remembered through Nathalia Holt's book Rise of the Rocket Girls and an article by Occidental College, Canright's Alma mater, Guardians of the Galaxy. Additionally, Barbara's daughter, Patricia Canright Smith, has preserved Barbara's life in her poem She Would Love to See China.

Biography Dulk was born in K√∂nigsberg to Friedrich Philipp Dulk (1788‚Äì1851). He studied medicine and the natural sciences in K√∂nigsberg and in Leipzig and Breslau. He took an active part in the popular uprisings of 1848, at which time his revolutionary drama Lea appeared. After traveling in the Orient, he settled in Geneva in 1850, and subsequently in Stuttgart, where he wrote the dramas Jesus der Christ (1865) and Simson (1859), in which play the conflict between Judaism and paganism is depicted. One of his later dramas, K√∂nig Enzio, was set to music by Johann Joseph Abert. As an adherent of socialism he became conspicuous, in 1871, through his opposition to the Franco-Prussian War, and his publications Patriotismus and Fr√∂mmigkeit obtained a wide circulation. In 1882 he founded in Stuttgart the first society of freethinkers in Germany, and during the last years of his life devoted his pen principally to the discussion of the radical side of religio-philosophical subjects.

Personal life  Grant grew up in Portland, Oregon, and moved to New York with her husband in the 1960s. She later separated from her husband, was radicalized through the Anti-War Movement, and became involved in the Women's Movement as an activist, musician, and photographer.  Music  Bev Grant at a Poor People's Campaign music event at Interference Archive in 2019 During her childhood in Portland, Grant sang and performed with her two older sisters. After moving to New York City in the 1960s, Grant began performing and writing music in social movements, composing her first parody song for the 1968 Miss America protests in Atlantic City. She was involved throughout the 1970s and 1980s with the band Human Condition, which she helped create in 1972. They performed folk, rock, and world music and played a key role in New York City's underground music scene. Their first album, The Working People Gonna Rise!, was recorded in 1974 with Barbara Dane at Paredon Records. Much of Grant's music writing has focused on the lives and labor conditions of the working poor. Haberman, Clyde (Sept 2, 2000). \\"NYC: Now, Joe Hill Would Have Had Carpal Tunnel.\\" New York Times. In 1991, Grant joined the United Association of Labor Education Northeast Union Women‚Äôs Summer School as cultural director. She is founder and director of the Brooklyn Women's Chorus. From 2006-2008, Grant performed with other female musicians as part of a group called Bev Grant and the Dissident Daughters which included singers Angela Lockhart and Carolynn Murphy. After that, she performed with Ina May Wool as WOOL&GRANT; until 2015. She released the solo album, It's Personal, in 2017.

Included in her documentary photographs are images of the Black Panther Free Breakfast Program, the Jeanette Rankin Brigade March on Washington, the 1968 Filmore East Takeover, and of Fidel Castro speaking on the occasion of the 10th Anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. Some of her early photographs were published in underground newspapers and distributed through Liberation News Service; many have been distributed by Getty Images and were featured in a solo exhibition in 2018 at Osmos Gallery in New York City. Grant's photography depicts her own activism and her involvement with New York Radical Women. Her documentation of the 1968 Miss America Protests was featured in her 2018 solo exhibition at Osmos; these photographs have become widely popular and are Grant's best known work. Her press pass allowed her to take photographs inside the pageant itself, where protesters unfurled banners and released stink bombs. Grant's photography was used in making the film She's Beautiful When She's Angry, released in 2015.  Film  As a member of Newsreel, Grant caught several important events on film, including the 1968 Miss America pageant for the Newsreel film Up Against the Wall Ms. America. Her work as an activist and filmmaker gave her contacts within, and filming access to, groups including the Young Lords, the Black Panther Party, and the Poor People's Campaign. She contributed the theme song to the1971 film, Janie's Janie, which was is considered \\"an important early film of the women's movement.\\"  Activism  As an activist, Grant attended her first anti-war demonstrations in New York City and was radicalized at a meeting of Students for a Democratic Society at Princeton in 1967. Grant was a member of New York Radical Women, and she participated in and photographed a wide range of related political events including the 1968 demonstrations against the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City and the October 31, 1968 hex on Wall Street by Florika Remetier, Peggy Dobbins, Susan Silverman, Judith Duffett, Ros Baxandall, and Cynthia Funk of W.I.T.C.H., the Women‚Äôs International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell. Grant has articulated the important connection between the Civil Rights Movement and the Women's Movement she took part in, noting that many women's liberation organizers had participated in Civil Rights organizing and brought valuable skills and knowledge from that work. Her conceptualization of the way women's oppression as a result of larger oppressions led to her later activism as an anti-imperialist.

It is a semi-erect or weakly spreading, woody shrub with pinnate leaves and white to pink, four-petalled flowers. Description Boronia elisabethiae is a semi-erect or weakly spreading, woody shrub that grows to about high and wide. It has pinnate leaves with between three and nine leaflets, the entire leaf long and wide in outline on a petiole long. The end leaflet is narrow elliptic to linear, long and wide and the side leaflet are similar but longer. The flowers are white to pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to three in upper leaf axils or on the ends of the branches. The flowers are borne on a stalk long. The four sepals are triangular, long and wide. The four petals are long and the eight stamens are slightly hairy. Flowering occurs from November to March and the fruit is a capsule about long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia elisabethiae was first formally described in 2003 by Marco F. Duretto who published the description in Muelleria from a specimen collected near Lake Pedder. The specific epithet (elisabethiae) honours Elisabeth Murdoch, a patron of the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

Danheiser is an American organic chemist and is the Arthur C. Cope Professor of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Chair of the MIT Faculty. His research involves the invention of new methods for the synthesis of complex organic compounds. Danheiser is known for the Danheiser annulation organic reaction and Danheiser benzannulation chemical reaction.  Education  Danheiser was born in New York and received his undergraduate education at Columbia College. While working as an undergraduate under the direction of Gilbert Stork, Danheiser developed a method for the regiospecific alkylation of beta-diketone enol ethers (the \\"Stork-Danheiser Alkylation\\"). and employed it in a total synthesis of the spiro sesquiterpene beta-vetivone. Danheiser received his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1978. His doctoral research (under the direction of E. J. Corey) involved the first total synthesis of the diterpene plant growth hormone gibberellic acid.  Research  Danheiser's research has focused on the development of new strategies for the synthesis of complex molecules and their application in the total synthesis of natural products. Synthetic methods invented in his laboratory include highly stereoselective [4 + 1] cyclopentene annulations based on oxyanion and carbanion-accelerated vinylcyclopropane rearrangements; the application of organosilanes (e.g., allenylsilanes, propargylsilanes, and allylsilanes) in a general [3 + 2] annulation strategy for the synthesis of five-membered carbocycles and heterocycles (the \\"Danheiser Annulation\\"); benzannulation strategies based on pericyclic transformations of vinylketenes (‚ÄúDanheiser Benzannulation‚Äù); methods for the synthesis of aromatic and dihydroaromatic compounds based on cycloadditions of highly unsaturated conjugated molecules such as conjugated 1,3-enynes; and formal [2 + 2 + 2] cycloadditions based on propargylic ene reaction/Diels-Alder cycloaddition cascades. Natural products synthesized in his laboratory at MIT include the neurotoxic alkaloids anatoxin a and quinolizidine 217A, the immunosuppressant agent mycophenolic acid the antitumor agent ascochlorin and a number of diterpene quinones derived from the Chinese traditional medicine Dan Shen.  Notable research awards  Danheiser was awarded the Cope Scholar Award of the American Chemical Society in 1995. He is a Fellow of the American Chemical Society.  Teaching and service  Danheiser has a particular interest in reproducibility in scientific research. He has been the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Organic Syntheses and a member of the Board of Directors of the Organic Syntheses corporation since 2004. Organic Syntheses has the unusual feature that all data and experiments reported in articles must be confirmed in the laboratory of a member of the editorial board prior to publication. Danheiser has a longstanding interest in laboratory safety and at MIT he has served as the chair of several committees including the MIT Chemistry Department EHS Committee which was recognized in 1991 as the first recipient of the American Chemical Society Division of Chemical Safety national award for \\"best university safety program\\". Danheiser also served on the National Research Council Committee on Prudent Practices for the Handling, Storage and Disposal of Chemicals in Laboratories, chairing the Subcommittee on Assessing Chemical Hazards. At MIT, Danheiser's educational contributions have been recognized with a MacVicar Faculty Fellowship, the School of Science Prize for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the MIT Graduate Student Council Teaching Award, and the School of Science Prize for Graduate Education.

Life and career The son of the trade unionist and Communist J. T. Murphy and his wife, Ethel \\"Molly\\" Morris, Murphy was born at Sheffield. His father's political activities took the family to Minsk in the Byelorussian SSR in 1926. Controversially, his parents had placed him in the fee paying public school Bedales in Hampshire in 1928, which was popular with Fabians. His parents hoped placing him in a fee paying school would improve his prospects. After completing his education at Bedales, Murphy went up to the University of London where he studied medicine, graduating in 1945. He was commissioned into the Medical Branch of the Royal Air Force as a flying officer in December 1946. He was promoted to the rank of flight lieutenant in November 1947. While serving in the Royal Air Force, Murphy played two first-class cricket matches for the Combined Services cricket team in 1948. The first of these came against Worcestershire at Worcester, with his second appearance coming against Gloucestershire at Gloucester. He scored 24 runs in these two matches, with a high score of 11. He and his wife Nadia moved to Canada in 1950. He worked as a doctor in Field, British Columbia, and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, before moving to Toronto. He specialised in paediatric neurology, and was on the senior staff of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and was Associate Professor at the University of Toronto. He was married to Nadia for 73 years. They had one son.

It was formed in March 1907 by the amalgamation of four Toronto medical societies. The Academy published its own journal, Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine, as well as speeches, articles, essays and other work by Academy members writing on medical and non- medical subjects. The Academy's renowned library facility closed in 1991.  Organisation  The Academy of Medicine of Toronto served as a regional library service and continuing education resource for academics and physicians in Ontario, the second most extensive in Canada after McGill's. It was maintained by its members, at no cost to the public or government. It regularly published the Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine, Toronto. In 1972, the Academy housed some 60,000 monographs and 600 journals which it made available to any of its members, either locally or remotely, through an extensive inter-library loan network. The Academy also accommodated educational visits from many school groups around the year.  History  During the second half of the 19th century, Toronto had been home to \\"three independent and very antagonistic medical schools\\". In 1904, a stable medical faculty was established and the University of Toronto opened the Medical Building, and this allowed for the reorganization of the hospital medical staffs. At this point in time, Toronto had three medical societies: the Toronto Medical Society, founded in 1878; the Toronto Pathological Society, founded in 1889; and the Toronto Clinical Society, founded in 1892. In 1907, these three medical societies merged with the Ontario Medical Library Association to form the Academy of Medicine. It was the same year that London saw the unification of several medical societies under the Royal Society of Medicine. The institution was first housed at 9 Queen's Park, home of the Ontario Medical Library Association. The Ontario Medical Library Association voted to dissolve on 4 June 1907, and now became the nucleus of the new Academy. It contributed 117 members out of the 186 charter fellows at the founding of the Academy and extended the legacy of its provincial service by providing that medical practitioners throughout Ontario had access to the Academy's its facilities. The Academy expanded in the subsequent decades through a series of moves and building acquisitions that allowed for further development of its educational activities. The Academy of Medicine of Toronto thrived for many decades. However, survival became increasingly difficult for medical clubs and libraries not affiliated with larger institutions (such as universities). In 1977, the Ontario Labour Relations Board ordered the Academy of Medicine to compensate a union and its former striking employees for its union-busting activities, closing its telephone answering service for doctors rather than deal with the Communication Workers of Canada. In the 1980s, the Academy of Medicine ran into debt troubles. In 1981, The Globe and Mail reported that the Academy may have to sell its collection of rare books. In 1984, it was further reported that the Academy was obliged to sell Osler Hall, which housed its auditorium. The Academy published its Bulletin between 1927 (v.1) and 1990 (v.58). It took a hiatus between the years 1980-1989. After closure of the library facility in 1991, its collections were donated to the Toronto Hospital in June 1992. A sizeable collection from the Academy of Medicine was also acquired by the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto. On 5 July 1996, ownership of the collection passed from the Academy to the hospital. The hospital retained part of the collection, donated yet other parts, and disposed of the remainders. As of 2007, the Academy existed only virtually and offered occasional lectures.

History  The SBe series of bombs were designed to be semi-armor piercing fragmentation bombs that could act as an adjunct to the SD series of bombs. There were two bombs in this series the SBe 50, and the SBe 250. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The SBe series was an effort to balance low cost, good fragmentation, and effective explosives. The SBe series achieved its fragmentation by embedding scrap metal in a layer of concrete instead of having a thick steel casing like the SD series. This concept had already been used successfully on the SD 10 A Type II and the SD 10 DW.  Design  The body of the SBe 250 consisted of thin inner and outer steel cases with scrap metal embedded in a layer of concrete between the cases. The nose was formed from a 5 mm (3/16 in) steel dome and there was a single transverse fuze in the rear 1/3 of the bomb. There was also a central TNT exploder which ran through the ammonal explosive filler. The tail was sheet steel with four single braces and there was a removable trunnion band which was used to horizontally suspend the bomb. Due to its heavy construction its charge to weight ratio was only 18%. The bomb was painted blue green.

Shoalts stated he did not take his education seriously until after his first year at the University of Waterloo, when he decided he wanted to pursue journalism as a career. While at Conestoga College, he wrote for the student newspaper, Spoke. Career After graduating from Conestoga College, Shoalts earned an internship at The Kitchener-Waterloo Record, where he covered the Canadian Football League (CFL). From there he was hired at the Calgary Herald in 1979. In 1983, Shoalts was hired by the Toronto Sun as a copyeditor. In 1984, Shoalts was hired by The Globe and Mail to work on page layout and design, although he eventually earned a writing position. In 1986, Shoalts covered the CFL and worked in the Globes news department in 1991 before returning to sports and hockey. While working for the Globe in 1993, Shoalts and William Houston published a book titled Greed and Glory: The Fall of Hockey Czar Alan Eagleson which detailed Alan Eagleson's legal battle. While working for The Globe and Mail from Boston in 2007, Shoalts wrote a book titled Tales From The Toronto Maple Leafs which included anecdotes from various Toronto Maple Leafs personnel about the history of the hockey team. In 2009, Shoalts and journalist Paul Waldie won the Outstanding Sportswriting Award from Sports Media Canada for their coverage of the Phoenix Coyotes. In 2010, Conestoga College awarded him the Alumni of Distinction Award for Media and Design. In 2018, Shoalts published a book titled Hockey Fight in Canada: The Big Media Faceoff Over the NHL which described the NHL ending their deal with CBC and signing with Rogers. Publications The following is a list of major publications: * Greed and Glory: The Fall of Hockey Czar Alan Eagleson (1993) * Tales from the Toronto Maple Leafs (2007) * Tales from the Toronto Maple Leafs Locker Room: A Collection of the Greatest Maple Leafs Stories Ever Told (2012) * Hockey Fight in Canada: The Big Media Faceoff Over the NHL (2018) Personal life Shoalts and his wife Yvonne had two children together, however his son died in 2012. In 2016, Shoalts began performing stand-up comedy in comedy clubs.

Chernobyl  Officials used hydrometeorological data to create an image of what the potential nuclear fallout looked like after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Using this method, they were able to determine the distribution of radionuclides in the surrounding area, and discovered emissions from the nuclear reactor itself. These emissions included; fuel particles, radioactive gases, and aerosol particles. The fuel particles were due to the violent interaction between hot fuel and the cooling water in the reactor, and attached to these particles were Cerium, Zirconium, Lanthanum, and Strontium. All of these elements have low volatility, meaning they prefer to stay in a liquid or solid state rather than condensing into the atmosphere and existing as vapor. * Cerium and Lanthanum can cause irreversible damage to marine life by deteriorating cell membranes, affecting reproductive capability, as well as crippling the nervous system. * Strontium in its non- nuclear isotope is stable and harmless, however, when the radioactive isotope, Sr90, is released into the atmosphere it can lead to anemia, cancers, and cause shortages in oxygen. * The aerosol particles had traces of Tellurium, a toxic element which can create issues in developing fetuses, along with Caesium, which is an unstable, incredibly reactive, and toxic element. * Also found in the aerosol particles was enriched Uranium-235. * The most prevalent radioactive gas detected was Radon, a noble gas that has no odor, no color, and no taste, and can also travel into the atmosphere or bodies of water. Radon is also directly linked to lung cancer, and is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the populace. All of these elements only deteriorate through radioactive decay, which is also known as a half-life. Half-lives of the nuclides previously discussed can range from mere hours, to decades. The shortest half-life for the previous elements is Zr95, an isotope of zirconium which takes 1.4 hours to decay. The longest is Pu235, which takes approximately 24,000 years to decay. While the initial release of these particles and elements was rather large, there were multiple low-level releases for at least a month after the initial incident at Chernobyl.  Local effects  Surrounding wildlife and fauna were drastically affected by Chernobyl's explosions. Coniferous trees, which are plentiful in the surrounding landscape, were heavily effected due to their biological sensitivity to radiation exposure. Within days of the initial explosion many pine trees in a 4 km radius died, with lessening yet still harmful effects being observed up to 120 km away. Many trees experienced interruptions in their growth, reproduction was crippled, and there were multiple observations of morphological changes. Hot particles also landed on these forests, causing holes and hollows to be burned into the trees. The surrounding soil was covered in radionuclides, which prevented substantial new growth. Deciduous trees such as Aspen, Birch, Alder, and Oak trees are more resistant to radiation exposure than coniferous trees, however they aren't immune. Damage seen on these trees was less harsh than observed on the pine trees. A lot of new deciduous growth suffered from necrosis, death of living tissue, and foliage on existing trees turned yellow and fell off. Deciduous trees resilience has allowed them to bounce back and they have populated where many coniferous trees, mostly pine, once stood. Herbaceous vegetation was also affected by radiation fallout. There were many observations of color changes in the cells, chlorophyll mutation, lack of flowering, growth depression, and vegetation death. Mammals are a highly radio-sensitive class, and observations of mice in the surrounding area of Chernobyl showed a population decrease. Embryonic mortality increased as well, however, migration patterns of the rodents made the damaged population number increase once again. Among the small rodents affected, it was observed that there were increasing issues in the blood and livers, which is a direct correlation to radiation exposure. Issues such as liver cirrhosis, enlarged spleens, increased peroxide oxidation of tissue lipids, and a decrease in the levels of enzymes were all present in the rodents exposed to the radioactive blasts. Larger wildlife didn't fair much better. Although most livestock were relocated a safe distance away, horses and cattle located on an isolated island 6 km away from the Chernobyl radioactivity were not spared. Hyperthyroidism, stunted growth, and, of course, death plagued the animals left on the island. The loss of human population in Chernobyl, sometimes referred to as the \\"exclusion zone,\\" has allowed the ecosystems to recover. The use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers has decreased because there is less agricultural activity. Biodiversity of plants and wildlife has increased, and animal populations have also increased. However, radiation continues to impact the local wildlife.  Global effects  Factors such as rainfall, wind currents, and the initial explosions at Chernobyl themselves caused the nuclear fallout to spread throughout Europe, Asia, as well as parts of North America. Not only was there a spread of these various radioactive elements previously mentioned, but there were also problems with what are known as hot particles. The Chernobyl reactor didn't just expel aerosol particles, fuel particles, and radioactive gases, but there was an additional expulsion of Uranium fuel fused together with radionuclides. These hot particles could spread for thousands of Kilometers and could produce concentrated substances in the form of raindrops known as Liquid hot particles. These particles were potentially hazardous, even in low- level radiation areas. The radioactive level in each individual hot particle could rise as high as 10 kBq, which is a fairly high dosage of radiation. These liquid hot particle droplets could be absorbed in two main ways; ingestion through food or water, and inhalation.

He did not play basketball as a freshman and played sparingly on the Galloping Ghosts' junior varsity team as a sophomore before starting his final two years. He scored over 1,000 career points at Abington, despite only playing two seasons, and averaged 19.5 points per game and was a second team AAAA All-State selection as a senior. College career Lock Haven Hinton began his collegiate career at Lock Haven, playing two seasons for the Bald Eagles after redshirting as a freshman due to academics. He averaged 23 points per game both seasons and led the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) with 2.4 steals per game as a redshirt sophomore, earning first team All-PSAC East honors and was named the PSAC East Freshman of the Year during his redshirt freshman season. Despite his success, Hinton opted to transfer after his redshirt sophomore season. He was the fastest player in PSAC history to reach 1,000 career points and finished his career at Lock Haven with 1,227. Shaw Hinton ultimately transferred to Shaw University, in large part due to head coach Flip Murray's Philadelphia connections. In his first season with the Bears, he averaged an NCAA Division II-leading 29.4 points per game and was named the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) Player of the Year. Considered to be a rare Division II NBA prospect, Hinton announced on March 7, 2019 that he would be forgoing his final year of eligibility to enter the 2019 NBA draft. In his only season with Shaw Hinton scored 853 points and finished his collegiate career with 2,080 points in 81 games played (25.7 points per game). Professional career Hinton went unselected in the 2019 NBA Draft and reportedly signed an Exhibit 10 contract with the New York Knicks as an undrafted free agent later that night. Hinton officially signed with the Knicks on September 17, 2019, but was waived on October 16. Following his release, he joined the Knicks' NBA G League affiliate, the Westchester Knicks, as an affiliate player.

Life and Oeuvre  Hamerschlag was born in 1902 in Vienna, daughter of the Jewish physician Richard Hamerschlag and his wife Pauline, born Herz. From 1911 (according to other sources as early as 1908) she attended the Juvenile Art Class of Franz Ci≈æek and studied from 1917 at the Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule with Bertold L√∂ffler (printing), Oskar Strnad (stage design) and Eduard Wimmer-Wisgrill (fashion). Hamerschlag made lithographs for two books, published by Wiener Werkst√§tte from 1920. With Kinderfreuden, her second book, she had great success. Die portfolios Die Maske des Roten Todes and Die Stadt showed their virtuoso handling of the woodcut and were also noticed abroad. At the age of 20, Hamerschlag became editorial member of the magazine Wiener Mode. As a painter she worked in oil and watercolor. She also designed costumes. In Rome, she staged several pieces in Anton Giulio Bragaglia's Theater of the Independents and also furnished them. In 1922 she married the architect and Loos student Joseph Berger. Even after the First World War, women only had the opportunity to exhibit as a guest in the artists' associations; membership was still denied. In 1927, the first Viennese exhibition of women's art took place in the rooms of the Museum f√ºr Kunst und Industrie, where Hamerschlag exhibited several works. Fritz Lampl wrote in 1928 in German art and decoration: \\"\\" (Margaret Hamerschlag, if she avoids the dangers of playful craft painting exercise ... soon be in the ranks of the best.) Hamerschlag lived from 1924 to 1934 in the artists' colony on Rosenh√ºgel. Hamerschlag's husband received an assignment in Palestine in 1934, she accompanied him and exhibited in 1935 in Jerusalem. The couple moved to London in 1936, where Hamerschlag worked as a portraitist and book illustrator, publishing illustrations in numerous magazines and newspapers. Her son Raymond F. was born in 1937.

Not until the end of the Second World War did Hamerschlag change her surname to Berger- Hamerschlag and often signed with Berger. She participated in numerous group exhibitions in England. In addition to her painting, she wrote novels, short stories, and an autobiography. In 1950 she began to teach in youth clubs and published her experiences there in 1955 in her most famous work Journey into a fog with own illustrations.

He asks for lawyer Joseph Doyle, unaware that Doyle had died almost two months earlier; Joseph's widow and legal partner, Constant Doyle, comes to see Cal. Despite Cal's hostility and mistrust, Constant arranges his bail. It turns out that Cal's late father, an engineer for Otis who'd died from alcoholism, had invented a device that made the company millions but was only paid $2000 for it. Cal believed that his father had been cheated, and that Cal's cousin Steven Arthur, who also worked for Otis, was responsible for it. Cal had been put up to breaking into Steven's office by Mrs. Letty Arthur, who wanted to find out where Steven had been hiding money from her; while Cal was there, he found a date book which he believed contained proof that Steven had stolen money that rightfully belonged to his father. Later, while being questioned by Constant, Letty claims that Joseph Doyle, while acting as legal consultant to Otis, was actually the one responsible for swindling Cal's father. After discovering the break-in, Steven and his boss Lawrence Otis arrange for Cal to meet Steven at Otis' house, where Steven offers him $2000 for his father's work. This only angers Cal, and the two of them scuffle; Cal is knocked out, and when he awakens he finds that Steven had been stabbed to death. The police arrest Cal. In the courtroom, Constant brings the truth to light by pointing out something irregular about how Steven's body was dressed, and by explaining the true meaning of one of the entries in Steven's date book. The real murderer is exposed, and Joseph's reputation is restored. Later, at Constant's office, she suggests that she and Cal go out for a steak dinner. They leave and close the door, then Constant opens it again and says into the empty office, \\"Good night, Joe,\\" and closes it again.

Early life Smith was born to Mark Smith and Diane Shader Smith on October 12, 1992 and diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a \\"progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time\\", at age 3. The disease cripples by inhibiting oxygen and nutrient absorption required for growth and energy with treatment regimens of more than 60 pills per day and waking up repeatedly for antibiotic IV treatments and lung exercises, yet Smith was determined to live well. She maintained a 4.3 grade point average, was captain of three different team sports, and was elected prom queen. By age 15, bacteria had colonized Smith's lungs, including a form of Burkholderia cenocepacia which mutated over a decade of antibiotic treatment from a normal vegetable bacteria into rare, aggressive superbug with no known treatment. This allowed her to push for experimental options with bacteriophage treatment, which engineers viruses to destroy bacteria. She attended Stanford University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa, majoring in human biology with a concentration in environmental anthropology. She also worked as a senior producer on Green Grid Radio, an environmental podcast featured on KCRW, National Radio Project and State of the Human. After graduation, Smith became a cystic fibrosis advocate and began work as a writer. However, her lungs took a turn for the worse in 2012 and she received a lung transplant on September 11, 2017. Unfortunately the superbug had survived in her throat and she passed away on November 15, 2017 at age 25 before bacteriophage treatment could be successfully administered, but provided lung samples to further the research for other patients. Advocacy Smith's determination to live with joy despite her physical prognosis was inspirational to research and the cystic fibrosis community Smith's outlook is credited as a driving force behind two cystic fibrosis charities. ‚ÄúAn Evening in Mallory‚Äôs Garden‚Äù was started in 1995 and has raised more than $5 million while Lunges4Lungs gained national awareness including corporate support from companies like Lululemon and star support including Katy Perry.

Design and development The SB 14 was designed to minimalist principles, reducing wetted area and use of high speed sections in a high aspect-ratio wing. As an economy measure, the tail unit of the Schleicher ASH 26 was utilised. To improve performance of the wing in a wide range of conditions, the wing-tips have swept wing-lets, as well as turbulators forward of the flaps on the undersurface of the wings. The SB 14 is a shoulder-wing sailplane constructed from carbon-fibre composite materials. The wings are of very high aspect-ratio and incorporate full span flaperons with slots for when the flaps are extended. The fuselage follows contemporary design practice with a cockpit pod and slender rear fuselage terminating in a T-tail. The cross section of the fuselage has been minimised throughout, reducing wetted area and therefore minimising drag. Control is through conventional elevator and rudder with full span slotted flaperons on the wings and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes on the upper surfaces at about 1/3 span. The undercarriage is a conventional retractable mono-wheel main undercarriage with a steel tipped rubber block tail-skid under the fin.

According to historian Hugh N. Kennedy, Umayya was known to be \\"easygoing, generous, peace-loving and, his enemies alleged, pompous and effeminate\\".Kennedy 2007, p. 241. Life Umayya was a son of Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, a former governor of Kufa. They were members of the Umayyad dynasty, which had been ruling the caliphate since 661. Umayyad authority across the caliphate had collapsed in 684, but was reconstituted under Marwan I in Syria and Egypt in 685. His son Abd al-Malik reasserted Umayyad rule over Arabia, Iraq and Khurasan between 691 and 692. He appointed Umayya's brother Khalid governor of Basra, while his initial appointee in Khurasan was Bukayr ibn Wisha, a member of the Tamim, an Arab tribe and faction from which many of the Muslim troops of Khurasan hailed.Rowson 1989, pp. 7‚Äì8. At the time of the Umayyad restoration, conflict between various factions within the Tamim was rife and left them vulnerable to local powers. Thus, leaders of the troops from Khurasan called on the caliph to appoint a neutral governor to keep order.Rowson 1989, p. 9. Abd al-Malik agreed and appointed Umayya in place of Bukayr, either in 691/92, 692/93 or in 693/94. Abd al-Malik held great affection for Umayya, according to 10th-century historian al-Tabari, and proudly remarked that \\"he [Umayya] is from the same brood as I\\". Khurasan remained a distinct governorship and included Sijistan (Sistan),Shaban 1979, p. 45. to which Umayya appointed his son Abd Allah as lieutenant governor.Biesterfeldt and G√ºnther, p. 118. Map of Khurasan and Transoxiana in the 7th/8th centuries Umayya's principal domestic challenge was reconciling the various factions of Tamim. However, Bukayr was resentful of his dismissal and he and his partisans secretly opposed Umayya, while their rivals within Tamim led by Bahir ibn Warqa cooperated with him. To appease Bukayr, Umayya granted him the sub-governorship of Tukharistan, but withdrew the appointment after intrigues by Bahir, who warned Bukayr would use it as an opportunity to rebel against the governor.Rowson 1989, p. 165. In 696, he charged Bukayr with command of a military campaign against the Bukharans in Transoxiana, but again recanted as a result of Bahir's intrigues.Rowson 1989, pp. 166‚Äì167. Instead, Umayya personally led the expedition and ordered Bukayr to remain in Merv to assist his son Ziyad, who he had left in charge. Not long after Umayya departed, Bukayr revolted and imprisoned Ziyad. Upon being informed of Bukayr's revolt, Umayya entered a truce with the Bukharans and returned to confront the rebels.Rowson 1989, pp. 167‚Äì168. Umayya defeated Bukayr but spared his life and offered him generous sums in return for his quiescence.Rowson 1989, pp. 170‚Äì171. However, the peace between them was short-lived: Bukayr resumed his intrigues, and Umayya had him summoned and then executed by Bahir. Another nagging issue for Umayya was subduing Musa ibn Abd Allah ibn Khazim, son of the slain Zubayrid governor of Khurasan, who had established an independent stronghold in Tirmidh.Shaban 1979, p. 48. Umayya was consistently bogged down by Tamimi revolts and internecine rivalry, and thus unable to seriously challenge Musa.Shaban 1979, pp. 48‚Äì49. After executing Bukayr, he dispatched troops to conquer Tirmidh in 697, but they were defeated by Musa. In that same year, Abd al-Malik dismissed Umayya and added Khurasan and Sijistan to the governorship of Iraq under al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf.Rowson 1989, p. 177. The latter, in turn, appointed al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra as his deputy governor in the province.Rowson 1989, p. 181. Umayya later retired to the Jordan district and died in al-Sinnabra before the end of Abd al-Malik's reign in 705.Mayer 1952, p. 185.

Her scholarship focuses on 19th century American History, Hawaiian History and Literature, Indigenous epistemology and translation, and Colonial and Indigenous history and historiography.  Early life and education  Arista was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawai ªi and she graduated from the Kamehameha Schools in 1986. She received both her BA (1992) and her MA (1998) in Hawaiian Religion from the Department of Religion at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa. In 2010, she earned her PhD from the Department of History at Brandeis University. Arista's dissertation, ‚ÄúHistories of Unequal Measure: Euro-American Encounters With Hawaiian Governance and Law, 1793-1827,‚Äù won the 2010 Allan Nevins Prize from the Society of American Historians for the \\"best-written doctoral dissertation on a significant subject in American history\\". Arista's education includes mentorship and training through Hawaiian kumu (teachers) Aunty Edith McKinzie, Rubellite Kawena Johnson, Kalani Akana, Manu Haokalani Gay, Pomaka'i Gaui, and John Keolamaka'ainanakalahuiokalaninokamehameha ªekolu Lake.  Academic career  Arista was hired as an assistant professor in the Department of History at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa in 2008. In 2013-14, Arista was a post- doctoral fellow in the Department of English at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2018, Arista was promoted to associate professor of Hawaiian History at the University of Hawai'i.  Research and publications  Arista's research focuses on Hawaiian governance and customary law, as well as the rules and pedagogies which structure the passing on of traditional Hawaiian knowledge. While drawing attention to the breadth of Hawaiian language textual archives, Arista's work suggests methods for how to approach the complexity of Hawaiian language by recognizing and assembling important patterns of Hawaiian discourse. Arista has also written about traditional Hawaiian mele (chants), and Hawaiian film, art and artists. Arista's current research examines the cultural, legal, and political colonization of the Hawaiian islands. She has published on prostitution in 19th century Hawai'i, the arrival of James Cook to the Hawaiian islands, the appropriation of Hawaiian culture, the recording and transmission of Hawaiian history, and early Hawaiian publications and historians. She is a leading expert on Hawaiian historian and chiefly counsellor David Malo and is immersed within the community of Hawaiian scholars. Under the auspices of the University of Hawai ªi Committee for the Preservation and Study of Hawaiian Language, Art, and Culture, Arista is a member of a team of University of Hawai ªi researchers currently working to collect, understand, interpret, and translate mele Kanikau, Hawaiian grief chants and laments that were published in 19th century Hawaiian-language newspapers. Arista's first book, The Kingdom and the Republic: Sovereign Hawai'i and the Early United States, relates the experience of native Hawaiian encounters with colonialism during the early- to mid-nineteenth century. It was published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 2018.  Public-Facing scholarship  In 2015, Arista created the Facebook group 365 Days of Aloha to promote the well being of kanaka mƒÅoli (native Hawaiian). Daily posts were curated to expand public knowledge of 'aloha' beyond the tropes promoted by popular consumerist culture which simplify the term as a translation of 'hello', 'goodbye', and 'I love you'. The daily entries grew to incorporate original translations of popular Hawaiian mele (songs,) oli (chants), and  ª≈çlelo no ªeau (proverbs) from the Hawaiian language into English. This work, along with accompanying photographs, music, and videos, aims to be a bulwark against the inaccurate representations of Hawaiian culture in popular media. While much of Arista's work has focused on the early nineteenth-century movement of aural-oral mo ªolelo, authoritative speech, and performative literature into written and published text, she has recently shifted to the perpetuation and persistence of Hawaiian knowledge into digital media. As a public intellectual and digital humanist, she has argued at conferences and presentations that the work of creating new modes of engagement with Hawaiian knowledge needs to be shaped by those trained in customary and traditional knowledge and language, and not entrusted solely to engineers, coders and computer scientists who may have not been trained to a deep foundation in tradition. As such, Arista is a knowledge-keeper and contributor to ‚ÄúHe Au Hou 1 & 2‚Äù (\\"A New World\\"), two Hawaiian-language video games that were produced in 2017 & 2018 through a joint collaboration between Initiative for Indigenous Futures and Kanaeokana. Arista appeared on an episode of Matt Gilbertson's Design Talk Hawaii podcast and collaborated on the award-winning \\"Making Kin with the Machines\\". Arista also makes regular appearances at community events in Honolulu, writes about the experience of the increased touristification of Hawai'i, and is a strategic consultant for Mana Up, a Hawaii-based organization that supports Hawai'i-based products and companies.

She was among a handful of important female book printers in Paris during this time, including Charlotte Guillard, Francoise Louvain and Marie L'Angelier. She was the daughter of Pasquier Bonhomme, himself a printer and one of four appointed booksellers of the University of Paris, and the wife of another printer, Thielmann Kerver. She began printing on her own following her husband's death in 1522. Estimates of her output range from 136 (according to Axel Erdmann) to 200 (according to Beatrice Beech, based on Renouard) publications before her own death in 1557. Because she often used her husband's name on the colophon for early books, her identity as the printer can be difficult to pinpoint. The University of Paris and the Catholic Church are counted among her patrons. She published a book of hours in 1523 and another in 1546; both books survive. In 1526, she became the first woman to publish the Bible. She also published the Roman Breviary (Latin: Breviarium Romanum) in 1534 and a Breviarium Romanum nuper reformatum in 1537. She joined forces with Charlotte Guillard to demand better quality paper from the papermakers' guild.

She is known for her work in defining institutional racism, personally mediated racism, and internalized racism in the context of modern U.S. race relations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jones drew attention to why racism and not race is a risk factor and called for actions to address structural racism.  Career  Jones' work focuses on naming, measuring and addressing the impacts of racism on health and well-being. To illustrate the effects of racism, Jones often uses allegories or stories, such as The Gardener's Tale, which she shared in a 2000 article in the American Journal of Public Health and in a TEDx talk she gave in 2014. Along with co-authors, she wrote a chapter on Action and Allegories for the American Public Health Association book, Racism: Science & Tools for the Public Health Professional. Jones is a 2019‚Äì2020 Radcliffe Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. As a Radcliffe fellow, she is developing tools to inspire, equip, and engage all Americans in a national campaign against racism. She is a Past President of the American Public Health Association (2015‚Äì2016) and a Senior Fellow at the Satcher Health Leadership Institute and the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the Morehouse School of Medicine. She was a Medical Officer and Research Director on Social Determinants of Health and Equity for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2000‚Äì2014). Jones has delivered seven commencement speeches since 2013 at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health (2018), University of Minnesota School of Public Health (2017), Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (2017), CUNY School of Medicine (2017), UCSF School of Medicine (2016), UC Berkeley School of Public Health (2016), and the University of Washington School of Public Health (2013). In 2016, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  Education  Following her graduation from high school, Jones went on to receive her B.A. in molecular biology from Wellesley College in 1976. She then went on to earn her M.D. from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 1981 and her M.P.H. from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health the following year. She earned her Ph.D. in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1995. The title of her dissertation was Methods for Comparing Distributions: Development and Application Exploring \\"Race\\"-Associated Differences in Systolic Blood Pressure.  Post-graduate training  Following her graduation from the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Jones completed two residency programs: one in general preventive medicine from 1981 to 1983 at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and another in family practice at Montefiore Medical Center from 1983 to 1986.  Faculty appointments  Following the completion of her residency in family practice from Montefiore Medical Center, Jones held the position of visiting assistant professor in the Department of Community Health and Social Medicine at the City University of New York Medical School from 1986 to 1987. Her first professorship was at the Harvard School of Public Health, where she held the position of assistant professor in the Departments of Health and Social Behavior, Epidemiology, and Division of Public Health Practice from 1994 to 2000. In 2003, Jones was appointed adjunct associate professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine in the Department of Community Health and Preventive Medicine, and in 2004 she was appointed adjunct professor at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, and in the Department of Epidemiology. She continues to hold both of these positions to this day. In 2012, Jones was a visiting professor at Meharry Medical College as a part of the Scholars-in-Residence Program under the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Health Policy. She was also a \\"Myron and Margaret Winegarden Visiting Professor\\" at the University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint in the Department of Public Health and Health Sciences from 2016 to 2017.

He was murdered in 2019; police believe his murder was politically motivated.  Early life  Dom√≠nguez was one of five siblings, at least one of whom disagreed with his political actions. He had completed graduation requirements at the Bolivarian University of Venezuela, where he studied Social Communications, but was not allowed to graduate. This is because he reported accounts of the university management that were negative towards the institution.  Career   Politics  Dom√≠nguez had attended the Bolivarian University of Venezuela, which teaches in line with Chavist ideology. He was a supporter of Hugo Ch√°vez, describing himself as a \\"dissident Chavista\\", but was critical of Nicol√°s Maduro. During his time as a student representative he began to speak out against corruption at the university, for which he received death threats. He suffered an attack that was reportedly committed by people hired by university management. At the time of his death he was the leader of the political group Movimiento Amplio Desaf√≠o de Todos, a Chavist faction that opposes Maduro, and occasionally participated in anti-Maduro demonstrations. Dissident Chavists are often the subject of personal violations in Venezuela, with 45 recent cases.  Journalism  As a journalist, he started investigating corruption of the state. He had been in contact with major political parties in Venezuela in discussion of cases of corruption linked to Maduro.  Disappearance and murder  Dom√≠nguez disappeared on 28 February 2019 in Caracas after attending a meeting for volunteers about bringing humanitarian aid into Venezuela, and was found on the side of Francisco Fajardo Freeway on the morning of 1 March 2019. According to missing posters, he was last seen in Los Cortijos. His family were not immediately informed, and had also been turned away by the police when trying to file a missing person's report; they were referred to intelligence services because of the political nature of the case due to Dom√≠nguez's positions. They then started a social media campaign with the hashtag \\"#QueAparezcaAliDominguez\\" (Hope that Al√≠ Dom√≠nguez will appear) on 3 March, also looking for Dom√≠nguez in hospitals but being turned away after showing photos. His family became aware of his location on 5 March, to identify his comatose body. Doctors then announced he had been admitted earlier. He was taken to the Hospital Domingo Luciani on 1 March, where he died early on the morning of 6 March, one day shy of his 27th birthday; his death has been accounted as murder. Police reported that his skull was fractured, his nose and several limbs were broken, and his teeth had been pulled. The police have not named suspects. He was reported to have been receiving more death threats shortly before his disappearance, telling his family and friends to keep fighting for his causes should something happen.  Reactions  Commenting on the murder, former United States Ambassador to Venezuela Charles Shapiro said that it was \\"repression\\" tactics, blaming the government because they \\"don't know what to do\\" whilst losing credibility. Carlos Vecchio, the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States appointed by Juan Guaid√≥'s government, said that they \\"deeply condemn the murder of the journalist Al√≠ Dom√≠nguez\\" and congratulated him for recognizing Maduro's corruption and aligning himself with the opposition despite being chavista. Popular Will, the party of self-declared president Guaid√≥, called for a \\"thorough investigation\\". The Cuerpo de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, Penales y Criminal√≠sticas began an investigation, with family and friends saying it was clearly deliberate and that they were not surprised. Fox News noted that there were over 900 political prisoners in Venezuela, 36 of whom are journalists, asking why only with Dom√≠nguez's death were people experiencing \\"outrage\\".

She is a Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of California, San Diego and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is known for her contributions to our understanding of how dynein, an exceptionally large motor protein that moves many intracellular cargos, works and is regulated. She developed one of the first systems to produce recombinant dynein and discovered that, unlike other cytoskeletal motors, dynein can take a wide variety of step sizes, forward and back and even sideways. She lives in San Diego, CA.  Early life and education  Reck-Peterson was educated at Litchfield High School in Litchfield, MN, where she served as senior class president and graduated as salutatorian in 1989. She was an all-state track and cross-country runner and team captain. She was inducted into the Litchfield High School Hall of Fame in 2017.  Career  Reck-Peterson became interested in molecular motors when she took the Physiology Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. She chose the motor protein myosin as the topic of her Ph.D. work in the laboratories of Mark Mooseker and Peter Novick at Yale University. Her work focused on the class V myosins, which have multiple functions in the cell ranging from mRNA transport to cell polarity and membrane trafficking. She developed a modified in vitro motility assay to show that both Myo2p and Myo4p class V myosins in yeast appear to be non-processive motors in the absence of additional regulation, unlike their vertebrate counterparts. In 2001, Reck-Peterson moved to UCSF to pursue post-doctoral studies with Ronald Vale. She began to work on dynein, a molecular motor that transports cargoes such as proteins, organelles and messenger RNAs to locations where they are needed in the cell. Dynein uses the energy stored in ATP to move towards the \\"minus end\\" of microtubules. Defects in dyneins and their regulatory proteins lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, showing the importance of microtubule-based transport in long cells such as neurons. Reck-Peterson used single-molecule techniques to examine the stepping behavior of dynein, finding that isolated dynein can step forwards, backwards and even sideways. In 2007, Reck-Peterson joined the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School as an Assistant Professor. She continued to study the mechanism of dynein-mediated transport. Using DNA origami, she created artificial cargos that could be programmed to load onto multiple types of motors, and used these to create competition, or a \\"tug of war\\", between motors. She used an assay for long-distance microtubule-based transport in the long, highly polarized hyphae of Aspergillus nidulans to show that Lis-1 is an initiation factor for dynein-mediated transport, and to show that some cargos of microtubule-based motors hitchhike on others. Mutants in the gene encoding Lis-1 are one cause of lissencephaly, a severe brain disorder. In collaboration with Andres Leschziner, she showed that Lis-1 regulates the interaction between dynein and the microtubule in two different ways, and determined the structural basis for the switch between microtubule binding and microtubule release. In 2015 Reck-Peterson moved to the University of California, San Diego, and in 2018 she became an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Overview The word ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù comes from biology and is a contraction of ‚Äúecological system‚Äù; it refers to a system in which entities have some degree of mutual dependence. In a platform ecosystem, the value created by each member influences the value created by others. Because a robust and high- quality ecosystem of complements attracts more customers, complements need each other even though they might also be competing against each other. A platform‚Äôs boundaries can be well-defined with a stable set of members dedicated wholly to that platform, or they can be amorphous and changing, with members entering and exiting freely, and participating in multiple platforms simultaneously. For example, consider the difference between the television/movie streaming services HBO on Demand and Amazon Prime. HBO on Demand exists to serve only HBO content up to consumers. The shows available are tightly controlled, and there is limited entry and exit of show producers. The Amazon Prime ecosystem is much more open. In fact, just about any content producer ‚Äì including individual independent filmmakers‚Äîcan make their content available on Amazon Prime. In many platform ecosystems there are switching costs that make it difficult or costly to change ecosystems. Platforms and their complements often make investments in co-specialization or sign exclusivity agreements that bind them into stickier, longer-term relationships than the market contracts used in typical reseller arrangements. A video game that has been made for the Microsoft Xbox, for example, cannot be played on a PlayStation console unless a new version of it is made (and the game producer may have signed a contract with Microsoft that prohibits this). A platform ecosystem is thus characterized by relationships that are neither as independent as arms-length market contracts, nor as dependent as those within a hierarchical organization. It is, in essence, a hybrid organizational form. It strikes a compromise between the loose coupling of a purely modular system, and the tight coupling of a traditional integrated product. It enables customers to mix-and-match some components and complements, while still enabling some co-specialization and curation of the complements and components available for the system. In ecosystems, gaining support and approval of the other members and legitimacy matters, as the very concept of an ecosystem is based on the idea that every organism is interdependent on other organisms within the system and gaining acceptance from powerful actors is therefore crucial. Example Video game systems are an iconic example of platform ecosystems. Consoles need to launch with high quality games. Since it is difficult to induce game developers to make games for a console that has not yet been widely adopted, most game console producers must produce games themselves (or subsidize their production) to ensure that high quality games are available when the console launches. On the other hand, end users want more games than just those produced by the console producer, so console producers like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo also license third-party developers to produce games for their consoles. They carefully screen the licensed games for quality and compatibility, and they may require the game developers to sign exclusivity agreements or to customize the games for the console. Platform ecosystem as parallel conversations Platform, ecosystem, and particularly \\"platform ecosystem\\" is a disputed term in information systems, organizational management, and technology and innovation research Jochem Hummel said on 21 February 2020 in a lecture of the Digital Business Strategy postgraduate module at Warwick Business School. \\"Different researchers mean different things when referring to platform ecosystems,\\" Jochem said, \\"creating parallel conversations.\\" Similar comments were raised by Melissa Schilling on 30 November 2017 in a symposium titled 'A Multi- Disciplinary Perspective on Platform Ecosystems Research.' Melissa argued that almost every website was nowadays called a platform, with an ecosystem when users could choose between buying products or services from different vendors. \\"Does this mean McDonalds is a platform ecosystem?\\", she asked the other panelists. Since 2017, consensus has emerged among scholars that platforms ecosystems typically require the involvement of in some way or another digital technology. This may have triggered the term to become less popular as scholars started using the term 'digital platform' or 'digital platform ecosystems' instead popularized through, for example, the 2018 'Special Issue: Digital Infrastructure and Platforms' in Information Systems Research.
